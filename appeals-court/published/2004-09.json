Beatty, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3861\r\nHeard June 8, 2004 â€“ Filed September \r\n  7, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSteven L. Brown and Robert P. Gruber, both of Charleston, \r\n  for Appellants. \r\nRichard H. Rhodes and Ray E. Thompson, Jr., both of Spartanburg, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Grant Textiles and its insurer, \r\n  U.S. Fire Insurance Company, appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the \r\n  decision of the full commission and finding Charles Grantâ€™s injuries compensable \r\n  under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We reverse and reinstate \r\n  the full commissionâ€™s decision.\r\nFACTS\r\nGrant is the Vice-President of Grant Textiles, \r\n  where he is responsible for selling textile machinery parts.Â  On the day of \r\n  the accident, Grant drove to the Clinton House and Meeting Plantation, a private \r\n  hunting preserve and meeting center owned individually by him, to deliver bobbin \r\n  samples to customers of Grant Textiles who were staying there.Â  Grant Textiles \r\n  has a corporate membership at the Clinton House and, although its customers \r\n  are occasionally guests of the Clinton House, the company has no ownership interest \r\n  in the facility.Â  \r\nAs he approached the entrance gate to the Clinton \r\n  House, Grant and another motorist abruptly swerved to miss an object in the \r\n  roadway.Â  Grant testified he was concerned the object created a safety hazard \r\n  to guests traveling to and from the Clinton House.Â  On his arrival, Grant alerted \r\n  the manager of the Clinton House to the obstacle, and both men walked back down \r\n  the highway to attempt to remove it.Â  As Grant walked along the shoulder of \r\n  the road, a pickup truck swerved off the road while attempting to pass a car, \r\n  and struck Grant from behind.Â  As a result, he suffered bruising to the right \r\n  side of his body and severe injury to his right arm.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found Grantâ€™s \r\n  injuries arose out of his employment with Grant Textiles and awarded compensation \r\n  for his claim.Â  The full commission reversed, finding Grantâ€™s accident had no \r\n  causal connection with his employment.Â  The full commission also found Grantâ€™s \r\n  ordinary job duties did not require him to remove debris from the roads and \r\n  his job duties and responsibilities were in no way related to road maintenance.Â  \r\n  The circuit court reversed the full commission, concluding the injuries were \r\n  compensable.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA reviewing court will not overturn a \r\n  decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is \r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.Â  Dukes \r\n  v. Rural Metro Corp., 356 S.C. 107, 109, 587 S.E.2d 687, 688 (2003).Â  â€œSubstantial \r\n  evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify \r\n  its action.â€Â  Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).Â  The question of whether an accident arises out of and \r\n  in the course and scope of employment is largely a question of fact for the \r\n  full commission.Â  Grice v. National Cash Register Co., 250 S.C. 1, 3, \r\n  156 S.E.2d 321, 322 (1967).Â  However, where the facts are undisputed, the question \r\n  of whether an accident is compensable is a question of law.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg \r\n  Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGrant may recover workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  benefits only if he sustained an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the \r\n  course of the employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2003).Â  An injury \r\n  arises out of oneâ€™s employment â€œwhen there is a causal connection between the \r\n  conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting \r\n  injury.â€Â  Broughton v. S. of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 497, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  634, 638 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Although the injury need not be expected or even \r\n  foreseeable, it must appear to have originated in an employment-related risk \r\n  and be a rational consequence of that risk.Â  Carter v. Penney Tire &amp; \r\n  Recapping Co., 261 S.C. 341, 345, 200 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1973) (citations omitted). \r\n\r\nGrant was a senior executive at his family-owned \r\n  textile supply company where he was principally involved with sales.Â  In fact, \r\n  according to his own testimony he would have engaged in sales activity with \r\n  his customers at Clinton House on the day of the accident had he not returned \r\n  to the highway to remove the obstacle in the road.Â  He admitted his job duties \r\n  and responsibilities with Grant Textiles did not include removing debris from \r\n  the public highway.Â  \r\nAs the sole finder of fact, the full commission \r\n  found that Grantâ€™s injuries did not arise out of his employment with Grant Textiles \r\n  because the cause of the accident had no relation to his employment duties.Â  \r\n  â€œThe question of whether an accident arises out of and is in the course and \r\n  scope of employment is largely a question of fact for the Full Commission.â€Â  \r\n  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 638; see also \r\n  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 518, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nBased on that finding of fact, the full commission \r\n  reached the legal conclusion that Grantâ€™s accident and resulting injuries had \r\n  no causal connection to his employment with Grant Textiles.Â  The factual findings \r\n  made by the full commission are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Thus, Grantâ€™s \r\n  claim is not compensable as a matter of law.Â  See Douglas v. Spartan \r\n  Mills, 245 S.C. 265, 140 S.E.2d 173 (1965) (holding â€œan injury which cannot \r\n  fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which \r\n  comes from a hazard to which [one] would have been equally exposed apart from \r\n  the employmentâ€ cannot be said to arise out of the claimantâ€™s employment).\r\nWe therefore conclude the trial court \r\n  erred in reversing the commissionâ€™s decision. Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling is reversed, and the full commissionâ€™s ruling is reinstated.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n CURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissenting:Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent from the majorityâ€™s determination that Grantâ€™s injury is not compensable \r\n  under South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Law.Â  I would hold that Grantâ€™s injury \r\n  is compensable because it arose out of and in the course of his employment.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe majority bases its decision largely \r\n  upon what it perceives to be our limited standard of review.Â  While I agree \r\n  that the question of whether an accident arises out of and in the course of \r\n  employment is largely one of fact, here there are no material facts in dispute. \r\n  [1] Â  Thus, the question of whether the accident is compensable is a question \r\n  of law.Â  See Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. \r\n  510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nDespite the fact that Grant owns the Clinton House, \r\n  the only reason Grant drove to the Clinton House on the day of the accident \r\n  was to deliver sample bobbins to customers of Grant Textiles.Â  Grantâ€™s father, \r\n  who is the president of Grant Textiles, was already at the Clinton House meeting \r\n  with those customers.Â  Â \r\nAs described in the majorityâ€™s opinion, as Grant \r\n  approached the Clinton House, he had to swerve out of his lane in order to avoid \r\n  debris in the road.Â  After successfully maneuvering around the hazard, Grant \r\n  left his truck idling in the entranceway of the Clinton House and walked back \r\n  down the highway to remove the debris from the road.Â  Although removing debris \r\n  from the highway was certainly not one of his regular duties as vice-president \r\n  of Grant Textiles, Grant explained that, on this occasion, he felt that he did \r\n  have an obligation to remove the hazard.Â  Specifically, Grant testified:Â Â  \r\n\r\n[T]o me that right there was a safety issue because I had \r\n  to come out of the road [in order to avoid the obstacle] and ended up right \r\n  there at the driveway [of the Clinton House].Â  And I had some customers going \r\n  and coming.Â  I had some customers coming in that evening.Â  And me and my father \r\n  was [sic] leaving.Â  If you travel as much as I do and see some accidents, you \r\n  know, I thought I was doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nBy attempting to remove the debris from the road, Grant was \r\n  trying to ensure that the customers, his father (a co-worker), and he could \r\n  safely travel to and from the Clinton House.Â  \r\nFor an injury to be compensable under the South \r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, it must both arise out of and be in the \r\n  course of the employment.Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 \r\n  S.C. 43, 49, 508 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1998).Â  The phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ refers to \r\n  the causal origin of the injury, whereas the phrase â€œin the course ofâ€ refers \r\n  to the injuryâ€™s time, place, and circumstance.Â  Id. at 50, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  at 24. In Hiers v. Brunson Construction Co., our supreme court explained:\r\n\r\nâ€˜[I]f in the course of [a workerâ€™s] employment an emergency \r\n  arises and, without deserting his employment, [the worker] does what he thinks \r\n  necessary for the purpose of advancing the work in which he is engaged in the \r\n  interest of his employer, and in so doing he suffers injury, the accident may \r\n  properly be regarded as arising out of the employment.â€™\r\n\r\n221 S.C. 212, 234-235, 70 S.E.2d 211, 222 (1952) \r\n  (quoting 58 Am.Jur. 764).Â  Furthermore, in Osteen v. Greenville County School \r\n  District, 333 S.C. 43, 48, 508 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1998), the supreme court recognized \r\n  that our state has â€œadopted Professor Larsonâ€™s view that there are circumstances \r\n  when injuries arising out of acts outside the scope of an employeeâ€™s regular \r\n  duties may be compensable.â€Â  The court explained that â€œ[t]hese circumstances \r\n  have been applied to: (1) acts benefiting co-employees; (2) acts benefiting \r\n  customers or strangers; (3) acts benefiting claimant; and (4) acts benefiting \r\n  [the] employer privately.â€Â  Id. at 48-49, 508 S.E.2d at 24 (citing Larson, \r\n  Â§Â§ 27.00-27.48) (internal footnote omitted).Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the case before us, the undisputed \r\n  facts indicate that the time, place, and scope of Grantâ€™s duties as an employee \r\n  of Grant Textiles brought him immediately in contact with a dangerous situation. \r\n  The undisputed facts also show that Grant attempted to remove the debris from \r\n  the road in order to ensure that he, his co-employee, and the customers of Grant \r\n  Textiles could safely travel to and from the Clinton House.Â  Thus, Grantâ€™s injury \r\n  arose out of and in the course of his employment. Osteen, 333 S.C. at \r\n  48-49, 508 S.E.2d at 24.\r\nThe supreme courtâ€™s decision in Howell \r\n  v. Kash &amp; Karry, 264 S.C. 298, 214 S.E.2d 821 (1975), lends further \r\n  support to awarding Grant benefits.Â  In Howell, an employee of a grocery \r\n  store was injured when he chased down two boys who had snatched a purse from \r\n  a woman in the parking lot.Â  The supreme court acknowledged that chasing thieves \r\n  was not part of the employeeâ€™s regular duties, but ultimately concluded the \r\n  employeeâ€™s injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment.Â  In reaching \r\n  this conclusion the court explained that â€œawards have been upheld for injuries \r\n  occurring in the course of miscellaneous Good Samaritan activities by employees, \r\n  on the theory that the employer ultimately profited as a result of the good \r\n  will thus created.â€Â  Id. at 301-302, 214 S.E.2d at 822.Â  Like the grocery \r\n  store employee in Howell, the time, place, and scope of Grantâ€™s actual \r\n  duties brought him immediately in contact with a situation that was dangerous \r\n  to his employerâ€™s customers.Â Â  While clearing debris from the highway was not \r\n  a part of Grantâ€™s regular duties, his attempt to rectify a dangerous situation \r\n  was a Good Samaritan act similar to the grocery store clerkâ€™s actions in Howell.Â  \r\n  Therefore, I would affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision to award Grant benefits.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  When asked during oral argument which facts were in dispute, the \r\n    attorney for Grant Textiles pointed to conflicting testimony concerning the \r\n    distance between the entrance of the Clinton House and the accident.Â  Grant \r\n    testified that he believed the obstacle was fifty feet down the road, but \r\n    â€œit may have been further.â€Â Â  The trooper from the highway patrol who investigated \r\n    the accident testified that â€œseeing as how both parties had left the scene, \r\n    [he] was not one hundred percent certain exactly where [the accident] took \r\n    place.â€Â  The trooper further testified that, 325 feet from the entrance of \r\n    the Clinton House, he found a pair of glasses on the side of the road.Â Â  While \r\n    the testimony from Grant and the trooper did not coincide exactly, both of \r\n    their descriptions indicate that the accident took place in close proximity \r\n    to the entrance of the Clinton House.Â  Thus, any difference in their testimony \r\n    is immaterial.Â  Furthermore, when this case was presented to the circuit court, \r\n    Grantâ€™s attorney stated twice that the facts were not in dispute, and the \r\n    attorney for Grant Textiles never objected to that or pointed out any facts \r\n    that were disputed.

Peeples, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3862\r\nHeard April 7, 2004 â€“ Filed September \r\n  7, 2004 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLewis C. Lanier, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\nRandolph Murdaugh, IV, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: Verlette R. Kizer brought this \r\n  action seeking a declaratory judgment under an underinsured motorist (UIM) policy \r\n  issued to her by Horace Mann Insurance Company.Â  The circuit court found Mrs. \r\n  Kizer could receive compensation for an amount up to the limits of the UIM policy \r\n  subject to a setoff of $25,000.Â  Horace Mann appeals, asserting it is entitled \r\n  to a setoff of $50,000.Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nFACTS\r\nVerlette Kizerâ€™s claim for underinsured \r\n  motorist benefits arises from a collision in Bamberg County between an automobile \r\n  driven by her and one driven by Kenneth L. Kinard.Â  As a result of the collision, \r\n  Mrs. Kizer suffered severe personal injury.Â  Her husband, Charles F. Kizer, \r\n  also suffered damages for loss of consortium as a result of the accident; however, \r\n  Mr. Kizer never filed a loss of consortium action. Kinardâ€™s negligence or fault \r\n  in causing the accident and resulting injury and loss of consortium is not disputed \r\n  in this appeal.\r\nAt the time of the accident, Horace Mann \r\n  Insurance Company insured Mrs. Kizer against bodily injury or death caused by \r\n  an underinsured motorist. [1] Â  \r\n  Kinard had automobile liability insurance coverage with Government Employees \r\n  Insurance Company (GEICO) with split liability limits of $50,000 per person \r\n  and $100,000 per occurrence.Â  \r\nGEICO disbursed the $50,000 proceeds of \r\n  Kinardâ€™s liability coverage equally between Mrs. Kizer and her husband, receiving \r\n  a covenant not to execute from the Kizers.Â  Thus, GEICO allocated $25,000 to \r\n  Mrs. Kizer on her personal injury claim and $25,000 to Mr. Kizer on his loss \r\n  of consortium claim.Â  Claiming damages for her personal injuries in excess of \r\n  $25,000, Mrs. Kizer sought compensation under the Horace Mann UIM policy. [2]   \r\nHorace Mann denied Mrs. Kizerâ€™s request, \r\n  asserting it was entitled to a $50,000 setoff of GEICOâ€™s policy limits against \r\n  all liability stemming from her personal injury claim.Â  Mrs. Kizer, however, \r\n  asserted Horace Mann was only entitled to a setoff of $25,000 from the GEICO \r\n  payments because she received that amount.Â Â  Mrs. Kizer argues that the payments \r\n  she and her husband received exhausted the $50,000 per person liability limits \r\n  of the GEICO policy.Â  The circuit court agreed with Mrs. Kizer, finding, as \r\n  to Mrs. Kizerâ€™s claim, that Horace Mann was entitled to a setoff of $25,000 \r\n  of GEICOâ€™s payment. Also, the court determined that Horace Mann would be entitled \r\n  to a $25,000 setoff on any UIM claim by Mr. Kizer. Horace Mann appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal \r\n  nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Antley \r\n  v. Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 621, 625, 567 S.E.2d 872, 874 (Ct. App. 2002) \r\n  (citing Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991)).Â  \r\n  As the issue below involved a determination of underinsured motorist coverage, \r\n  the action is at law.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 \r\n  S.C. 231, 237, 530 S.E.2d 896, 899 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œIn an action at law, the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review \r\n  of the record reveals there is no evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s \r\n  findings.â€ Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHorace Mann contends it is entitled \r\n  to a setoff of GEICOâ€™s $50,000 policy limits in Mrs. Kizerâ€™s UIM claim because \r\n  Mrs. Kizer failed to exhaust GEICOâ€™s available coverage.Â  We agree that Horace \r\n  Mann is entitled to a setoff; the question presented on this appeal is the amount \r\n  of Horace Mannâ€™s setoff of GEICOâ€™s payment. \r\nUnderinsured motorist coverage is optional \r\n  coverage provided when the insured sustains damages in excess of the at-fault \r\n  driverâ€™s liability coverage, recovery being in addition to any recovery from \r\n  the at-fault motorist, the total recovery not to exceed the damages sustained.Â  \r\n  Broome v. Watts, 319 S.C. 337, 341, 461 S.E.2d 46, 48 (1995).Â  The UIM \r\n  statute does not require payment of the applicable policy limits as a precondition \r\n  to collecting UIM benefits; however, the UIM carrier is entitled to a credit \r\n  for any amount of liability coverage not exhausted in settlement. Cobb v. \r\n  Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 589, 482 S.E.2d 589, 597 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nâ€œThe very definition of UIM insurance \r\n  mandates set-off.â€ Broome, 319 S.C. at 341, 461 S.E.2d at 48.Â  Horace \r\n  Mann asserts that GEICOâ€™s apportionment of payment of its policy limits between \r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Kizer does not alter Horace Mannâ€™s right to a setoff of the entire \r\n  $50,000 against any claim by Mrs. Kizer.Â  Horace Mann argues that, notwithstanding \r\n  payment of the liability limits of GEICOâ€™s policy, the limits were not exhausted \r\n  as to Mrs. Kizerâ€™s bodily injury claim because the entire amount was not paid \r\n  to her.Â  We disagree.\r\nHorace Mann erroneously assumes that the \r\n  consequential damages characterization of a loss of consortium claim requires \r\n  that it be inseparable from the spouseâ€™s bodily injury claim.Â  The two claims \r\n  are distinct and independent.Â  â€œIt is well settled in South Carolina that one \r\n  spouse's cause of action for medical expenses and loss of consortium resulting \r\n  from negligent injuries to the other spouse is a different and distinct cause \r\n  of action from one maintained by the injured spouse; judgment in favor of the \r\n  defendant in one action is not a bar to the other action.â€ Graham v. Whitaker, \r\n  282 S.C. 393, 397, 321 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1984).\r\nâ€œ[A]ny person may maintain an action for damages \r\n  arising from an intentional or tortious violation of the right to the companionship, \r\n  aid, society and services of his or her spouse.â€Â  Stewart v. State Farm Mut. \r\n  Auto. Ins. Co., 341 S.C. 143, 156, 533 S.E.2d 597, 603-604 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n  (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-75-20 (1977)).Â  â€œ[L]oss of consortium is an independent \r\n  action, not derivative.â€Â  Stewart, 341 S.C. at 156, 533 S.E.2d at 604. \r\n\r\nOur courts have decided that â€œper personâ€ \r\n  liability limits include loss of consortium claims.

Burgess brought \r\n  a declaratory judgment action against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company seeking \r\n  a declaration that he was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage.Â  The trial \r\n  judge granted declaratory relief and found Burgess was entitled to UIM coverage \r\n  in the amount of $15,000.Â  Nationwide appeals.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS[1]&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nBurgess\r\nwas operating his 1986 Honda motorcycle when a car driven by Angelo T. Heyward\r\nstruck him. Heyward carried automobile liability insurance on his car with New\r\nHampshire Indemnity Company. Burgess collected $15,000 of liability coverage\r\nfrom New Hampshire Indemnity and agreed to a covenant not to execute with\r\nHeyward.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nBurgess had a liability policy on his motorcycle with\r\nAlpha Property and Casualty Insurance, but the policy did not provide any\r\nunderinsured motorist (â€œUIMâ€) coverage.&nbsp;\r\nIn addition to the motorcycle, Burgess also owned three vehicles that\r\nwere covered by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (â€œNationwideâ€). That\r\npolicy provided UIM coverage of $25,000 per person. The Uninsured and\r\nUnderinsured Motorist Endorsement provided that:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a vehicle owned by you or a relative is involved in\r\nan accident where you or a relative sustains bodily injury or property damage,\r\nthis policy shall:&nbsp; a) be primary if\r\nthe involved vehicle is your auto described on this policy; or b) be excess if\r\nthe involved vehicle is not your auto described on this policy.&nbsp; The amount of coverage applicable under this policy shall be\r\nthe lesser of the coverage limits under this policy or the coverage limits on\r\nthe vehicle involved in the accident.&nbsp;\r\n  Because the motorcycle was not listed under Nationwideâ€™s \r\n    policy, Nationwide refused to pay Burgess, arguing that the motorcycle did \r\n    not have any UIM coverage. \r\n  Burgess moved for declaratory judgment. He argued \r\n    that he was entitled to $15,000 of UIM coverage from the Nationwide policy \r\n    that covered his â€œat-homeâ€ vehicles. Nationwide countered it should not be \r\n    required to pay any UIM benefits because Burgess had more than the basic amount \r\n    of UIM coverage and the vehicle involved in the accident had none. Nationwide \r\n    also argued that its UM/UIM endorsement excludes coverage under these circumstances. \r\n    The trial judge granted declaratory relief to Burgess in the amount of $15,000. \r\n  \r\n  ISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n          I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n    Did the trial court err in finding Burgess was entitled to UIM coverage in \r\n    an amount equal to the liability coverage on the Honda motorcycle involved \r\n    in the accident under the Nationwide policy?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.\r\n        Did the trial court err in finding that Burgess was entitled to UIM coverage \r\n    under S.C.

Co. v. Horne, 356 S.C. 52, 56, 586 S.E.2d 865, 867 \r\n      (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, \r\n      400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991)). â€œAn action to determine coverage under an insurance \r\n      policy is an action at law.â€ S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, \r\n      344 S.C. 525, 528, 544 S.E.2d 848, 849 (Ct. App. 2001). In an action at \r\n      law, tried without a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial \r\n      court's findings of fact unless they are found to be without evidence that \r\n      reasonably supports those findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of \r\n      Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, when \r\n      an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is \r\n      free to review whether the trial court properly applied the law to those \r\n      facts.Â  In re Estate of Boynton, \r\n      355 S.C. 299, 301, 584 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 2003). In such a situation, \r\n      the appellate court does not have to defer to the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  \r\n      Id. \r\n   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    There is a great \r\n      division of authority as to coverage for damages arising out of accidents \r\n      involving owned but not insured vehicles.Â  In some jurisdictions, UIM coverage \r\n      follows the person; in others it follows the vehicle.Â  We believe that South \r\n      Carolina falls in the category where UIM coverage follows the person, as \r\n      is the case with uninsured motorist (â€œUMâ€) coverage.\r\n    UIM insurance is a variant of UM insurance.Â  \r\n      9 Couch on Ins. 3d Â§ 122:3 (2004).Â  In some jurisdictions, UIM is \r\n      referred to as supplemental uninsured coverage.Â  Id.Â  South Carolina \r\n      courts have often analogized UM and UIM, especially when discussing the \r\n      application and interpretation of section 38-77-160 of the South Carolina \r\n      Code (2002), which deals with UM and UIM coverage. \r\n      [2]  Therefore, our appellate courtsâ€™ treatment of UM is instructive \r\n      in this case. \r\n    The purpose of the UM statute is â€œto provide benefits \r\n      and protection against the peril of injury or death by an uninsured motorist \r\n      to an insured motorist, his family, and the permissive users of his vehicle.â€ \r\n      Ferguson v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 96, 100, 198 \r\n      S.E. 2d 522, 524 (1973).Â  The statute â€œis remedial in nature, enacted for \r\n      the benefit of injured persons, and is to be liberally construed so that \r\n      the purpose intended may be accomplished.â€ Gunnels v. American Liberty \r\n      Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 247, 161 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1968).\r\n    Our supreme court has previously explained, \r\n      â€œuninsured motorist coverage is not to provide coverage for the uninsured \r\n      vehicle but to afford additional protection to the insured.â€Â  Nationwide \r\n      Mut. Ins. Co. v. Howard, 288 S.C. 5, 12, 339 S.E.2d 501, 504 (citing \r\n      Hogan v. Home Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 157, 162, 194 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1973)).Â  \r\n      The court further clarified in Hogan that â€œunlike the provisions \r\n      relative to liability coverage, the statute plainly affords uninsured motorist \r\n      coverage to the named insured and resident relatives of his or her household \r\n      at all times and without regard to the activity in which they were engaged \r\n      at the time.Â  Such coverage is nowhere limited in the statute to the use \r\n      of the insured vehicle.â€Â  Hogan, 260 S.C. at 162, 194 S.E.2d at 892. \r\n    \r\n    Similarly, the statutory purpose of UIM coverage \r\n      is to provide coverage in the event damages are sustained in excess of the \r\n      liability limits carried by an at-fault insured or underinsured. S.C.Code \r\n      Ann. Â§ 38-77-160.Â  Thus, our UIM statute is also remedial in nature and \r\n      enacted for the benefit of injured persons. It should be construed liberally \r\n      to effect the purpose intended by the legislature. See Sloan v. \r\n      Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 564, 590 S.E.2d 338, 356 (Ct. App. \r\n      2003) (reasoning that the provisions of a code should be construed liberally \r\n      if the code is remedial in nature).\r\n    \r\n    Understanding that \r\n      UIM coverage is a variation of UM coverage, we believe that Hogan \r\n      indicates the legislative intent behind our UIM statute and is applicable \r\n      here. In other words, underinsurance, like uninsurance, is \r\n      personal and portable.Â  â€œIn jurisdictions where the coverage follows the \r\n      person any person who enjoys the status of an insured under a motor vehicle \r\n      policy of insurance which includes uninsured/underinsured coverage enjoys \r\n      coverage protection simply by reason of having been injured by an uninsured/underinsured \r\n      motorist.â€ 9 Couch on Ins. 3d Â§ 123:3. [3] \r\n    S.C. Code \r\n      Ann. Â§ 38-77-160\r\n    The proper interpretation \r\n      of section 38-77-160 is central to the resolution of the issues in this \r\n      case.Â  That section deals with UM and UIM and states:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n    Automobile insurance carriers \r\n      shall offer, at the option of the insured, uninsured motorist coverage up \r\n      to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage in addition to the mandatory \r\n      coverage prescribed by section 38-77-160.Â  Such carriers shall also offer, \r\n      at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits \r\n      of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event that \r\n      damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault \r\n      insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation \r\n      imposed by statute.Â  If, however, an insured or named insured is protected \r\n      by uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the basic limits, \r\n      the policy shall provide that the insured or named insured is protected \r\n      only to the extent of the coverage he has on the vehicle involved \r\n      in the accident. Â If none of the insuredâ€™s or named insuredâ€™s vehicles \r\n      is involved in the accident, coverage is available only to the extent of \r\n      coverage on any one of the vehicles with the excess or underinsured coverage. \r\n       [4]   \r\n\r\n    (Emphasis added).\r\n    Nationwide argues \r\n      that the emphasized language excludes basic UIM coverage in situations where \r\n      the vehicle involved in a collision is owned by the insured but is not specifically \r\n      covered in a UIM policy.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n    The emphasized language has \r\n      been interpreted or discussed on numerous occasions by our appellate courts. \r\n      [5] Â  Several of those cases involved facts very analogous to the case \r\n      sub-judice. [6] Â  However, none of them has directly \r\n      addressed the question we face today, that is whether or not section 38-77-160 \r\n      and public policy allow the exclusion of basic UIM coverage.Â  Each of the \r\n      cases addressed the issue of â€œstackingâ€ UIM or UM coverage.Â  Invariably, \r\n      each of these cases found the emphasized language to apply to situations \r\n      involving stacking.Â  See S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mooneyham, \r\n      304 S.C. 442, 445, 405 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1991) (â€œ[W]e interpret the pertinent \r\n      language of the statutes as setting a cap on the amount which can be stacked \r\n      . . . .â€).Â  In each case the insurer made an initial payment of at least \r\n      the basic UIM/UM coverage and only litigated additional UIM/UM payments.Â  \r\n    \r\n    To address the issue of basic \r\n      coverage, we must consider section 38-77-160 in its entirety, not just the \r\n      isolated emphasized portion argued by Nationwide.Â  See Beattie \r\n      v. Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 319 S.C. 449, 452, 462 S.E.2d \r\n      276, 278 (1995) (â€œAn entire code section should be read as a whole so that \r\n      phraseology of isolated section is not controlling.â€). Additionally, â€œ[o]ne \r\n      of the primary rules in a construction of a statute is that the words used \r\n      therein should be taken in the ordinary and popular significance, unless \r\n      there is something in the statute requiring a different interpretation.â€ \r\n      Gambrell, 280 S.C. at 73, 310 S.E.2d at 817.Â  A subtle or forced \r\n      construction of words in a statute for the purpose of expanding the operation \r\n      of the statute is prohibited.Â  See Moon v. City of Greer, \r\n      348 S.C. 184, 188, 558 S.E.2d 527, 530 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  \r\n    Section 38-77-160 states in \r\n      pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         Such carriers shall also offer, at the option of the insured, \r\n      underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured liability \r\n      coverage to provide coverage in the event that damages are sustained \r\n      in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault insured \r\n      or underinsured motorist or in excess of any damages cap or limitation imposed \r\n      by statute . . . .Â  If none of the insuredâ€™s or named insuredâ€™s vehicles \r\n      is involved in the accident, coverage is available only to the extent of \r\n      coverage on any one of the vehicles with the excess or underinsured coverage.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n     Nowhere in the statute \r\n      is there language that limits basic UIM coverage to an insured vehicle.Â  \r\n      To the contrary, the statute plainly allows coverage when none of the insuredâ€™s \r\n      vehicles is involved in the accident.Â  To say that the legislative intent \r\n      was to exclude basic UIM coverage if an insuredâ€™s vehicle is involved in \r\n      an accident but include coverage when none of the insuredâ€™s vehicles is \r\n      involved in an accident is absurd, absent specific language to that effect.Â  \r\n      In construing a statute, the court looks to its language as a whole in light \r\n      of its manifest purpose.Â  Simmons v. City of Columbia, 280 S.C. 163, \r\n      165, 311 S.E.2d 732, 733 (1984).Â  The manifest purpose of section 38-77-160 \r\n      is to provide coverage in the event that the insured sustains damages in \r\n      excess of the liability limits carried by the at fault motorist. \r\n    Nationwideâ€™s argument that \r\n      the emphasized language of section 38-77-160 excludes coverage because Burgess \r\n      had no UIM coverage on the motorcycle is without merit based upon our finding \r\n      that UIM coverage is personal and portable.Â  Moreover, our supreme court \r\n      said in Howard, when construing the emphasized provision of 56-9-831 \r\n      as it pertains to UM coverage, that such coverage was nowhere limited to \r\n      the use of the insured vehicle. \r\n      [7] Â  That holding is instructive here.\r\n    Nationwide also argues that \r\n      since Burgessâ€™s UIM coverage exceeded the basic UIM coverage of $15,000, \r\n      his coverage is excess and therefore his claim is precluded by the emphasized \r\n      language in section 38-77-160. \r\n      [8] Â  However, section 38-77-160 does not limit basic UIM in \r\n      any way; all limitations specifically reference excess UIM. Had the \r\n      legislature intended to limit basic UIM coverage, it could have easily done \r\n      so by simply omitting the word â€œexcess.â€Â  To argue that Burgess should be \r\n      denied UIM coverage because he purchased too much is absurd.\r\n    Â Â  UIM Policy \r\n      Endorsement  \r\n    Nationwide next argues \r\n      that its UIM endorsement precludes Burgessâ€™sÂ Â Â  recovery of UIM benefits \r\n      because the motorcycle had no UIM coverage.Â  Nationwideâ€™s endorsement states, \r\n      in pertinent part, â€œ[t]he amount of coverage applicable under this policy \r\n      shall be the lesser of the coverage limits under this policy or the coverage \r\n      limits on the vehicle involved in the accident.â€\r\n    Nationwideâ€™s endorsement \r\n      language is far more restrictive than the language in section 38-77-160.Â  \r\n      Nationwide excludes the recovery of basic UIM whereas section 38-77-160 \r\n      merely allows an insurer to limit the amount of recovery of excess UIM.Â  \r\n      The statute does not allow an insurer to limit or exclude basic UIM in any \r\n      way.Â  An insurance policy issued pursuant to a statute may give more coverage \r\n      than the statute requires but not less.Â  Belk v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. \r\n      Co., 271 S.C. 24, 244 S.E.2d 744 (1978).Â  Once UIM is offered and accepted, \r\n      the coverage cannot be retracted. See Gambrell v. Travelers Ins. \r\n      Co., 280 S.C. 69, 72, 310 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1983). \r\n    Section \r\n      38-77-160 governs the application of UIM coverage. It applies to every policy \r\n      as if embodied therein, and inconsistent insurance policy provisions are \r\n      void.Â  State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gunning, 340 S.C. 526, 532 S.E.2d \r\n      16 (2000). Nationwideâ€™s endorsement exceeds the limitations allowed by section \r\n      38-77-160 and is therefore inconsistent with our public policy.Â  \r\n    Moreover, in State \r\n      Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Horry, 304 S.C. 165, 403 S.E.2d 318 (1991), our \r\n      supreme court expressly approved this courtâ€™s opinion in Purvis v. State \r\n      Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 302 S.C. 283, 403 S.E.2d 662 (Ct. App. 1991) which \r\n      declared South Carolina to be an â€œexcessâ€ UIM coverage state.Â  The court \r\n      went on to say that â€œexcessâ€ UIM coverage â€œprovides benefits to an insured \r\n      under his own policy at any time the at fault drivers liability coverage \r\n      is less than the amount of the claimants actual damages.â€Â  Horry, \r\n      304 S.C. at 169, 403 S.E.2d at 320 (emphasis added). \r\n      [9] Â  The court did not require that the vehicle involved in the accident \r\n      carry UIM coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    The trial court erred when it concluded \r\n      that Burgess was entitled to $15,000 UIM coverage from the at home vehicles \r\n      because he had $15,000 liability coverage on the motorcycle involved in \r\n      the accident. Burgess was entitled to $15,000 UIM coverage because that \r\n      is the statutory minimum coverage and Burgess had at least that amount on \r\n      the at home vehicles. However, because we find that UIM coverage is personal \r\n      and portable, and because we find that section 38-77-160 does not allow \r\n      the exclusion or restriction of basic UIM coverage, we affirm the trial \r\n      courtâ€™s decision as modified.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n     AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n    HEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The parties stipulate these facts. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  See McAllister v.

McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  Levell Weaver appeals his \r\n  convictions for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a \r\n  crime of violence. Weaver contends the trial court erred in:Â  (1) admitting \r\n  evidence obtained pursuant to a procedurally defective warrant; (2) admitting \r\n  hearsay testimony; and (3) declining to grant a mistrial based on inappropriate \r\n  prosecutorial comment on Weaverâ€™s decision not to testify during the trial.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 10:00 p.m. on June 23, 1999, Marion \r\n  Dwayne McKnight was shot thirteen times while outside a club called Robâ€™s Place \r\n  in Hemingway, South Carolina.Â  At the time of the shooting, McKnight was getting \r\n  into his car with Antonio Brown and Tracy Scott. Â After the shooting, \r\n  Scott contacted his mother, Loretta, who drove to the club.Â  When she arrived \r\n  she saw Weaver covered in blood, standing over McKnightâ€™s body that had been \r\n  stripped to its underwear. \r\nInvestigator Sandy Thompson, with the Williamsburg \r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department, was called around 11:00 p.m. to investigate the \r\n  incident.Â  Leroy Powell, who witnessed the shooting, identified Weaver as the \r\n  shooter.Â  Investigator Thompson interviewed other witnesses and spoke with investigators \r\n  at the scene who informed him that Weaver was a suspect and that he left the \r\n  scene driving a green Jeep. Â Upon further investigation, the officers \r\n  discovered that Weaver was at his cousinâ€™s house.Â  Investigator Thompson then \r\n  left for the residence accompanied by Investigator Collins and several other \r\n  officers.Â  At the home, the officers spoke with Weaverâ€™s cousin, Arnold Weaver.Â  \r\n  He confirmed Weaver arrived driving a green Jeep and told them Weaver had asked \r\n  for bleach, a trash bag, and a change of clothes.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter the discussion with Weaverâ€™s cousin, officers \r\n  found the Jeep in the backyard.Â  When Investigator Thompson opened the driverâ€™s \r\n  side door, he noticed the Jeepâ€™s back area was wet and smelled of bleach.Â  On \r\n  a pump house near the Jeep, Investigator Thompson also discovered a bag containing \r\n  a towel and some socks which smelled of bleach.Â  To preserve the evidence for \r\n  investigation, the officers seized the bag and towed the Jeep to an impoundment \r\n  area. Â During the early morning hours of June 24, 1999, Weaver turned \r\n  himself in at the Williamsburg County Jail.Â  \r\nAfter the Jeep was impounded, Lieutenant Ricky \r\n  Weston requested and obtained a search warrant.Â  Though the police searched \r\n  the impounded vehicle after the warrant was issued, no return of the warrant \r\n  was made. \r\nSLED Agent Steve Lambert processed the vehicle \r\n  and collected samples of blood evidence from the Jeep and the decedentâ€™s vehicle.Â  \r\n  During the search, Agent Lambert found a cloth with blood evidence on the back \r\n  seat of the Jeep. As part of the investigation, Lambert analyzed a pair of underwear \r\n  that contained blood evidence.Â  Agent Lambert received this evidence from Investigator \r\n  Dennis Parrott who identified the underwear as belonging to Weaver.Â  Investigator \r\n  Parrott also turned over the bag of clothing that was seized from the pump house \r\n  near the Jeep. Â DNA testing of the evidence revealed that all of the \r\n  samples matched the decedentâ€™s blood type.\r\nA Williamsburg County grand jury indicted Weaver \r\n  for murder, armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during a violent crime.Â  \r\n  Before trial, Weaverâ€™s counsel filed a motion to suppress evidence taken from \r\n  the Jeep on two primary grounds:Â  (1) the Jeep was seized without a warrant; \r\n  and (2) no return was made to the search warrant as required by South Carolina \r\n  Code section 17-13-140.Â  The trial court made a preliminary ruling denying the \r\n  motion to suppress.Â Â  \r\nDuring trial, Weaverâ€™s counsel renewed his motion.Â  \r\n  After hearing testimony and arguments, the court gave a final ruling denying \r\n  the motion to suppress. Â As a threshold matter, the court found Weaver \r\n  had standing to challenge the legitimacy of the search even though he was not \r\n  the owner of the vehicle.Â  The court then concluded a search warrant was not \r\n  necessary because the State had probable cause to seize the vehicle and to conduct \r\n  the subsequent search.Â  The court reasoned the warrantless search was permissible \r\n  based on the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment.Â  As a result, \r\n  the court found an analysis of the statutory provisions of section 17-13-140 \r\n  was unnecessary.\r\nThe jury found Weaver guilty of murder and possession \r\n  of a weapon during the commission of a crime of violence.Â  The trial court sentenced \r\n  Weaver to thirty years imprisonment for murder and a concurrent five-year sentence \r\n  for the weapon charge.Â Â  This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nWeaver contends the trial court erred in denying \r\n  his motion to suppress the evidence seized from the Jeep. Â Specifically, he \r\n  asserts the court erred in finding that a search warrant was not necessary.Â  \r\n  Moreover, because a warrant was required, Weaver claims the failure to file \r\n  a return as mandated by section 17-13-140 invalidated the search, and thus, \r\n  required the suppression of the evidence.\r\nâ€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court \r\n  is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the \r\n  findings.â€ State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIn an appeal from a motion to suppress evidence based on \r\n  Fourth Amendment grounds, an appellate court may conduct its own review of the \r\n  record to determine whether the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 349-50, 592 S.E.2d at 347.Â  \r\nSection 17-13-140 requires search warrants to be \r\n  executed and return made within ten days after the date of the warrant:\r\n\r\nAny warrant issued hereunder shall be executed and return \r\n  made only within ten days after it is dated. The officer executing the warrant \r\n  shall make and deliver a signed inventory of any articles seized by virtue of \r\n  the warrant, which shall be delivered to the judicial officer to whom the return \r\n  is to be made, and if a copy of the inventory is demanded by the person from \r\n  whose person or premises the property is taken, a copy of the inventory shall \r\n  be delivered to him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003).\r\nFailure to observe the ten-day requirement for \r\n  execution and return under section 17-13-140 does not necessarily void the warrant.Â  \r\n  State v. Wise, 272 S.C. 384, 386, 252 S.E.2d 294, 295 (1979) (holding \r\n  the ten-day requirement was ministerial and the defendant failed to show he \r\n  was prejudiced by the delay).Â  Because the statuteâ€™s return requirement is ministerial \r\n  in nature, any purported noncompliance only provides grounds for exclusion upon \r\n  a showing of prejudice.Â  State v. Mollison, 319 S.C. 41, 47, 459 S.E.2d \r\n  88, 92 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In at least one case, this court has excluded evidence \r\n  based on the provisions of section 17-13-140. State v. Freeman, 319 S.C. \r\n  110, 459 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In Freeman, we found that drug \r\n  evidence should have been excluded under a defective warrant where the State \r\n  failed to produce the original warrant and a signed, sworn return.Â  We concluded \r\n  the defendant was prejudiced by this failure given he was unable to review the \r\n  return and match the items listed with the items that were analyzed and admitted \r\n  into evidence.Â  Id. at 116-19, 459 S.E.2d at 871-72.\r\nHere, the police searched and seized the \r\n  Jeep prior to obtaining the warrant that Weaver contends was rendered faulty \r\n  by virtue of noncompliance with the statuteâ€™s return requirement.Â  We agree \r\n  with Weaver that the Stateâ€™s failure to produce a return constituted more than \r\n  a ministerial error.Â  However, as will be discussed, any error in failing to \r\n  file a return did not require the suppression of the evidence.Â  Under the specific \r\n  facts of this case, a warrant was not necessary to search and seize the Jeep. \r\n\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œ[t]he \r\n  right of the people to be secure . . . [from] unreasonable searches and seizures.â€ \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  â€œIn parallel with the protection of the Fourth Amendment, \r\n  the South Carolina Constitution also provides a safeguard against unlawful searches \r\n  and seizures.â€Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 643, 541 S.E.2d 837, \r\n  840 (2001); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  Evidence obtained in violation of the \r\n  Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in both state and federal court. Forrester, \r\n  343 S.C. at 643, 541 S.E.2d at 840.\r\nâ€œGenerally, a warrantless search is per se unreasonable \r\n  and thus violative of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against unreasonable \r\n  searches and seizures.â€ State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 331, 457 S.E.2d \r\n  616, 621 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œHowever, a warrantless search will withstand constitutional \r\n  scrutiny where the search falls within one of a few specifically established \r\n  and well delineated exceptions to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.â€ Id. \r\n  at 331-32, 457 S.E.2d at 621.Â  These exceptions include:Â  (1) search incident \r\n  to a lawful arrest;Â  (2) â€œhot pursuit;â€Â  (3) stop and frisk;Â  (4) automobile \r\n  exception;Â  (5) â€œplain viewâ€ doctrine;Â  (6) consent; and (7) abandonment.Â  State \r\n  v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 456-57, 462 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1995), cert. denied, \r\n  516 U.S. 1131 (1996). Â â€œThe burden of establishing probable cause as well as \r\n  the existence of circumstances constituting an exception to the general prohibition \r\n  against warrantless searches and seizures is upon the prosecution.â€Â  Bultron, \r\n  318 S.C. at 332, 457 S.E.2d at 621.\r\nOur supreme court analyzed the automobile exception \r\n  in State v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 351 S.E.2d 570 (1986).Â  In Cox, \r\n  the court stated:\r\n\r\nThe automobile exception was first articulated in Carroll \r\n  v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925).Â  Since \r\n  Carroll, the doctrine has been applied on a case-by-case basis to various \r\n  sets of facts.Â  \r\nThe two bases for the exception are:Â  (1) the ready mobility \r\n  of automobiles and the potential that evidence may be lost before a warrant \r\n  is obtained; and (2) the lessened expectation of privacy in motor vehicles which \r\n  are subject to governmental regulation.\r\n\r\nId. at 491, 351 S.E.2d at 571 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  In view of these reasons, the court found that â€œunder the automobile \r\n  exception, probable cause alone is sufficient to justify a warrantless \r\n  search.â€Â  Id. at 492, 351 S.E.2d at 571-72 (citing California v. Carney, \r\n  471 U.S. 386 (1985)).Â  Thus, â€œthe inherent mobility of automobiles provides \r\n  the requisite exigency.â€Â  Id. at 492, 351 S.E.2d at 572. \r\nIn this case, the State met its burden to prove \r\n  probable cause and the existence of circumstances to support the warrantless \r\n  search under the automobile exception.Â  During their investigation at the crime \r\n  scene, the officers established that:Â  (1) Weaver was a suspect; (2) he had \r\n  been seen driving a green Jeep; and (3) there most likely would be blood evidence \r\n  in the Jeep if in fact Weaver had been involved in the shooting.Â  Additionally, \r\n  once the officers arrived at Weaverâ€™s cousinâ€™s home, they discovered that Weaver \r\n  had asked for a change of clothing, a trash bag, and bleach.Â  Upon further investigation, \r\n  the officers found a bag of â€œwash clothesâ€ near the Jeep that smelled of bleach \r\n  and the inside of the Jeep was wet with bleach.Â  Thus, based on probable cause \r\n  that the automobile contained evidence of a crime, and the necessity to preserve \r\n  the potential blood evidence, the warrantless search and subsequent seizure \r\n  did not violate the Fourth Amendment. See Cox, 290 S.C. at 492, \r\n  351 S.E.2d at 572 (holding automobile exception applied to shotgun seized from \r\n  trunk of vehicle parked at defendantâ€™s home); State v. Peters, 271 S.C. \r\n  498, 501, 248 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1978) (finding probable cause existed to conduct \r\n  warrantless search of vehicle based on Carroll doctrine where police \r\n  stopped vehicle after receiving information from confidential informant that \r\n  defendant was driving vehicle containing marijuana); State v. Hayden, \r\n  268 S.C. 214, 218, 232 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1977) (holding probable cause and exigent \r\n  circumstances justified warrantless search of automobile where officers received \r\n  information from an informant that defendants would be traveling in a vehicle \r\n  containing illegal drugs and due to the lateness of the hour it would have been \r\n  impractical to get a search warrant); State v. Frank, 262 S.C. 526, 531-33, \r\n  205 S.E.2d 827, 830 (1974) (concluding warrantless search of automobile was \r\n  proper where officer had strong reasons to believe that the automobile was being \r\n  used in criminal activity and that it very probably contained stolen goods); \r\n  see also Robinson v. State, 308 A.2d 734, 739-40 (Md. Ct. \r\n  Spec. App. 1973) (outlining cases holding exigency existed for the search of \r\n  a vehicle and then removal to police garage).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe question then becomes whether the warrantless \r\n  search of the Jeep after it was impounded was permissible under the Fourth Amendment.Â  \r\n  Because the Jeep was at that point immobilized, Weaver asserts that a warrant \r\n  was required because the exigent circumstances of the mobility of the Jeep were \r\n  no longer present.\r\nAlthough there are no South Carolina cases directly \r\n  on point, the case law from the United States Supreme Court and other jurisdictions \r\n  supports the admissibility of this evidence despite the lack of a warrant.Â  \r\n  These cases stand for the proposition that if there is probable cause to search \r\n  a vehicle at the time it is seized this rationale does not disappear merely \r\n  because the vehicle is taken into police custody.Â  Because a subsequent search \r\n  would be part of an ongoing criminal investigation, a warrant would not be required.Â  \r\n  See, e.g.,Â  United States v. Johns, 469 U.S. 478, 487 (1985) (holding \r\n  warrantless search of packages seized three days earlier from trucks which were \r\n  suspected of being involved in drug smuggling operation was not unreasonable); \r\n  Florida v. Meyers, 466 U.S. 380, 382 (1984) (finding warrantless search \r\n  of automobile impounded and in police custody conducted approximately eight \r\n  hours after valid initial search at the time of defendantâ€™s arrest was proper); \r\n  Michigan v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259, 261 (1982) (â€œIt is thus clear that \r\n  the justification to conduct such a warrantless search does not vanish once \r\n  the car has been immobilized.â€); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 52 \r\n  (1970) (concluding officers had probable cause to conduct second search of automobile \r\n  at station house); Rabadi v. State, 541 N.E.2d 271, 275 (Ind. 1989) (â€œWhere \r\n  there is probable cause to believe that a vehicle was used in the commission \r\n  of a crime and contains evidence, a search of the impounded vehicle may be conducted \r\n  after the arrest at the police station.â€).Â  \r\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, the State \r\n  offered evidence that the Jeep was linked to the crime scene and contained evidence \r\n  when it was impounded.Â  Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding \r\n  that the officers had probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the \r\n  vehicle less than a day after it was impounded.Â  See Ex parte Boyd, \r\n  542 So. 2d 1276, 1284-86 (Ala. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 883 (1989) \r\n  (holding warrantless search of defendantâ€™s automobile four days after impoundment \r\n  was permissible under requirements of Fourth Amendment and state constitution \r\n  where officers had probable cause to search vehicle when it was impounded and \r\n  that probable cause continued between the time of the impoundment and the search); \r\n  Robinson v. State, 308 A.2d 734, 740-41 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1973) (finding \r\n  officersâ€™ decision to scrape carbon residue from tailpipe of defendantâ€™s vehicle \r\n  at impoundment lot without a warrant was permissible where officers had probable \r\n  cause to believe defendant was involved in double murder case and similar carbon \r\n  residue was found at the crime scene).Â  Moreover, the case law in our state \r\n  appears to support the admissibility of the evidence.Â  Cf. State v. \r\n  Lemacks, 275 S.C. 181, 183-84, 268 S.E.2d 285, 286 (1980) (holding police \r\n  officers were justified in impounding and conducting inventory search which \r\n  extended to the trunk of the vehicle where vehicle was abandoned and believed \r\n  to contain stolen goods). \r\nAs a consequence, even if a procedural defect marred \r\n  the later-acquired warrant, a subsequent failing cannot retroactively undermine \r\n  the admissibility of previously acquired evidence.Â  Because all the evidence \r\n  acquired from the Jeep fits within the purview of the automobile exception, \r\n  Weaver cannot show he was prejudiced by the failure to comply with the ten-day \r\n  return requirement.Â  Thus, the trial court properly admitted the evidence.\r\nDespite the applicability of the automobile exception, \r\n  Weaver contends the evidence should have been excluded because Article I, section \r\n  10 of the South Carolina Constitution afforded him greater protection.Â  Although \r\n  we agree with Weaver that our state constitution may provide greater protection \r\n  against unreasonable searches and seizures and unreasonable invasions of privacy, \r\n  our decision in no way violates or diminishes this protection.Â  See State \r\n  v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 644, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001). (â€œ[T]his Court \r\n  can interpret the state protection against unreasonable searches and seizures \r\n  in such a way as to provide greater protection than the federal Constitution.â€).Â  \r\n  In analyzing the automobile exception in this case, we have not blindly applied \r\n  the exception as a blanket provision for the admissibility of evidence.Â  Instead, \r\n  we have adhered to the probable cause requirement established by our case law \r\n  that inherently provides protection against unreasonable searches and seizures \r\n  as well as unreasonable invasions of privacy.Â  See California v. Carney, \r\n  471 U.S. 386, 394 (1985) (The two requirements for the application of the automobile \r\n  exception â€œensure that law enforcement officials are not unnecessarily hamstrung \r\n  in their efforts to detect and prosecute criminal activity, and that the legitimate \r\n  privacy interests of the public are protected.â€); State v. Lejeune, 576 \r\n  S.E.2d 888, 892 (Ga. 2003) (â€œ[T]he â€˜automobile exceptionâ€™ cases do not hold \r\n  that a search warrant is never needed to search a car.Â  There is an automobile \r\n  exception to the search warrant requirement, not an exemption.Â  Otherwise, the \r\n  Supreme Court of the United States would have held that the police would not, \r\n  under any circumstances, need to obtain a search warrant for an automobile, \r\n  provided they have probable cause for the search.â€).\r\nII.\r\nWeaver asserts the trial court erred in \r\n  admitting the testimony of Lieutenant Ricky Weston that â€œall of the evidence \r\n  led toâ€ or pointed to Weaver.Â  Because this testimony was based on what witnesses \r\n  told Lieutenant Weston, Weaver contends it constituted inadmissible hearsay.\r\nDuring the Stateâ€™s redirect examination of Lieutenant \r\n  Weston, the following exchange took place:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Solicitor:\r\n         Didâ€”Let me ask you this, Lieutenant Weston.Â  Why \r\n  didnâ€™t you do gunshot residue tests on these other people?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Weston:\r\n         Well, all evidence that the people they interviewed \r\n  there at Robâ€™s Place â€“\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Defense counsel:\r\n        Iâ€™ll object to what these people said, Your \r\n  Honor.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Court:&nbsp;\r\n         All right.Â  Iâ€™m going to sustain it as such because \r\n  you did ask him the question, so he can give a reason without saying what the \r\n  people told you.Â  You can say what his investigation revealed.Â  Thank you.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Weston:&nbsp;\r\n         All the evidence led to Levell Weaver.Â  I didnâ€™t \r\n  see no blood stain on none of the witnesses that I was talking to at that table.Â  \r\n  All of the witnesses that I talked to led me to believe that --\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Defense Counsel:&nbsp;\r\n         Iâ€™ll object to that, Your Honor.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Court:\r\n         Overruled.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Weston:\r\n         Led me to believe that the subject that we were looking \r\n  for was the only suspect that really was involved with doing the killing at \r\n  this crime scene, and I didnâ€™t see no reason to take swabs from those subjects \r\n  at that table.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made \r\n  by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence \r\n  to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  â€œThe rule against \r\n  hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out-of-court statement to \r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule applies.â€Â  \r\n  Simpkins v. State, 303 S.C. 364, 367, 401 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1991); Rule \r\n  803, SCRE.Â  \r\nFor several reasons we find no error in the admission \r\n  of the above testimony.Â  First, Lieutenant Weston never repeated statements \r\n  made to him by individuals at the crime scene.Â  Rather, he testified only to \r\n  the conclusions he made based on what his investigation had thus far revealed.Â  \r\n  Second, this testimony was in response to the questions asked on cross-examination \r\n  as to why Lieutenant Weston did not perform a gunshot residue test on everyone \r\n  at the crime scene.Â  Lieutenant Westonâ€™s testimony was offered to explain this \r\n  part of his investigation.Â  See State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, \r\n  451 S.E.2d 888, 893-94 (1994) (finding officersâ€™ statements explaining why they \r\n  began their surveillance of defendantâ€™s apartment were not hearsay); State \r\n  v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 558, 575 S.E.2d 77, 81 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œâ€˜[A]n \r\n  out of court statement is not hearsay if it is offered for the limited purpose \r\n  of explaining why a government investigation was undertaken.â€™â€ (quoting Brown, \r\n  317 S.C. at 63, 451 S.E.2d at 894)).Â  Furthermore, Lieutenant Weston did not \r\n  testify to any specific statements that identified Weaver. \r\n  [1] Â  Cf. German v. State, 325 S.C. 25, 27-28, 478 S.E.2d \r\n  687, 688-89 (1996) (holding testimony of undercover drug agent regarding tips \r\n  that defendant was selling drugs and description of defendant were inadmissible \r\n  hearsay given the statements specifically referred to defendant).Â  Because this \r\n  testimony did not constitute hearsay, the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in admitting it.Â  See State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 428, 462 \r\n  S.E.2d 263, 265 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1080 (1996) (stating the \r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion).\r\nWe also note the testimony is cumulative to that \r\n  given by Investigator Thompson to which Lee made no objection:Â  â€œUpon talking \r\n  to all of those people, gathered information that we gathered, myself along \r\n  with Investigator Collins started looking for Mr. Levell Weaver.â€Â Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Leroy Powell, an eyewitness to the shooting, testified Weaver was the shooter. \r\n  Â Thus, even if the testimony constituted hearsay, any error in its admission \r\n  would be harmless.Â  See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 197, \r\n  577 S.E.2d 445, 448-49 (2003) (stating the admission of improper evidence is \r\n  harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence); \r\n  State v. Kirby, 325 S.C. 390, 396-97, 481 S.E.2d 150, 153 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (finding even if officerâ€™s testimony regarding information radioed by the police \r\n  dispatcher constituted hearsay, its admission was harmless given it was cumulative \r\n  to similar testimony that was admitted without objection).\r\nIII.\r\nWeaver argues the trial court erred in not granting \r\n  a mistrial based on the solicitorâ€™s closing argument. He contends the solicitor \r\n  impermissibly commented on his right to not testify.Â  \r\nWeaver did not testify during the trial.Â  During \r\n  closing argument, Weaverâ€™s counsel asked the jury why Weaver would have remained \r\n  at the scene if he had, in fact, shot the victim:Â  â€œIf hearing [Leroy Powellâ€™s] \r\n  testimony and then [sic] believe his testimony, Levell shot a fellow some 13 \r\n  times and stayed there until later, does that have the ring of truthfulness \r\n  to it?Â  Ask yourselves those questions.â€\r\nDuring his closing argument, the solicitor suggested \r\n  only Weaver could properly provide an answer to the question posited by his \r\n  trial counsel:\r\n\r\nHe was laying there and Levell Weaver was standing down near \r\n  him or over him she said.Â  He had the gun in his hand and he had blood on him.Â  \r\n  Now, I canâ€™t explain to you why Levell Weaver was there.\r\nThatâ€™s one of the things [Weaverâ€™s counsel] said, why would \r\n  Levell Weaver stay around there all that time.Â  Nobody can tell you that except \r\n  Levell Weaver.\r\nI canâ€™t say why somebody would do something, but we know he \r\n  was there because Ronald Williams said that he went out there a couple of minutes \r\n  after the thing, after the shooting occurred, he went out the door.\r\n\r\nWeaverâ€™s counsel objected to the argument, contending \r\n  the solicitor impermissibly commented on Weaverâ€™s decision to not testify during \r\n  the trial.Â  After a bench conference, the trial court gave a curative instruction, \r\n  charging the jury the State must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that \r\n  a defendant has an absolute right to remain silent, which cannot be considered \r\n  against him if exercised. \r\nâ€œThe trial court has broad discretion \r\n  when dealing with the propriety of the solicitorâ€™s argument, including the question \r\n  of whether to grant a defendantâ€™s mistrial motion.â€Â  State v. Copeland, \r\n  321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996).Â  â€œThe trial courtâ€™s discretion \r\n  will not be overturned absent a showing of an abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law that prejudices the defendant.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nUnder the United States and South Carolina Constitutions, \r\n  a criminal defendant has a right to remain silent and to not testify during \r\n  his trial.Â  U.S. Const. amend. V; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12.Â  As a corollary \r\n  of this right, a prosecutorial comment, whether direct or indirect, upon a defendantâ€™s \r\n  failure to testify at trial is constitutionally impermissible.Â  State v. \r\n  Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 387, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211-12 (2001); State v. \r\n  Hawkins, 292 S.C. 418, 423, 357 S.E.2d 10, 13 (1987), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  \r\n  â€œWhere the solicitor refers to certain evidence as uncontradicted and the defendant \r\n  is the only person who could contradict that particular evidence, the statement \r\n  is viewed as a comment on the defendantâ€™s failure to testify.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Sweet, 342 S.C. 342, 348, 536 S.E.2d 91, 94 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nHere, by stating, â€œNobody can tell you that except \r\n  Levell Weaver,â€ the solicitor plainly implied a question for which only Weaver \r\n  could supply an answer, and therefore indirectly commented on Weaverâ€™s silence.Â  \r\n  At the same time, although it is improper for a solicitor to indirectly comment \r\n  on a defendantâ€™s failure to testify, such comments do not necessarily mandate \r\n  reversal of a conviction.Â  Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 187, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  733, 735 (1997).Â  Indeed, a criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial, \r\n  not a perfect one.Â  State v. Mizell, 332 S.C. 273, 285, 504 S.E.2d 338, \r\n  345 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Thus, as a prerequisite to reversal, Weaver must demonstrate \r\n  the effect of the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was to deny him a fair trial.Â  \r\n  In making this determination, we must examine the alleged impropriety in light \r\n  of the entire record.Â  State v. Brown, 333 S.C. 185, 191, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  38, 41 (Ct. App. 1998); see State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 159, \r\n  561 S.E.2d 640, 649 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œThe test of granting a new trial for alleged \r\n  improper closing argument is whether the solicitorâ€™s comments so infected the \r\n  trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.â€).\r\nIn full view of the statementâ€™s context, we are \r\n  forced to conclude that although the comment was improper, reversal is not mandated \r\n  in this case.Â  First, it was Weaverâ€™s counsel rather than the solicitor that \r\n  first asked the jury to contemplate why Weaver would have stood over the victim.Â  \r\n  Though it was still improper for the solicitor to point out only Weaver could \r\n  answer the question posed by his counsel, the egregiousness of the comment is \r\n  mitigated by the previous comment of Weaverâ€™s counsel.Â  Second, the trial court \r\n  gave a corrective instruction immediately after the allegedly improper argument.Â  \r\n  â€œGenerally, a trial judgeâ€™s curative instruction is deemed to cure any error.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 354, 573 S.E.2d 856, 863 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Weaverâ€™s motion \r\n  for mistrial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court \r\n  properly admitted the evidence seized from the Jeep based on the automobile \r\n  exception to the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, we hold the testimony of Lieutenant \r\n  Weston regarding his investigation did not constitute inadmissible hearsay.Â  \r\n  Even if it did, any error in its admission would be harmless.Â  Finally, we hold \r\n  any impropriety in the solicitorâ€™s closing argument did not warrant reversal \r\n  of Weaverâ€™s convictions.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  At oral argument, Weaverâ€™s appellate counsel asserted this issue \r\n    was controlled by a recent United States Supreme Court case.Â  Crawford \r\n    v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004).Â  In Crawford, the defendant \r\n    was convicted of first-degree assault with a deadly weapon despite his claim \r\n    of self-defense.Â  At trial, a tape-recorded statement of defendantâ€™s wife \r\n    to police officers, in which she implicated her husband in the stabbing, was \r\n    admitted at trial even though wife did not testify based on the spousal privilege.Â  \r\n    In offering this statement into evidence, the State relied on the hearsay \r\n    exception for statements against penal interest.Â  Id. at 1358.Â  The \r\n    Supreme Court reversed the defendantâ€™s conviction, finding the admission of \r\n    wifeâ€™s testimonial statement violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth \r\n    Amendment.Â  Even though there was an indication of reliability to the statement \r\n    and it fell within a hearsay exception, the Court believed such statement \r\n    could only be admitted if the witness was declared unavailable and the defendant \r\n    had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness prior to trial.Â  Id. \r\n    at 1374.\r\n  Even if a Confrontation \r\n    Clause argument was implicit in Weaverâ€™s counselâ€™s objection, the facts of \r\n    this case are decidedly different than those in Crawford.Â  As previously \r\n    stated, Lieutenant Weston did not repeat specific statements of witnesses \r\n    that implicated Weaver as a suspect.Â  Moreover, two of the witnesses, Loretta \r\n    Scott and Leroy Powell, who identified Weaver as a suspect, testified at trial \r\n    and were cross-examined by Weaverâ€™s counsel. Therefore, we do not believe \r\n    Crawford is dispositive.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3865","title":"DuRant v.

David DuRant filed \r\n  an administrative appeal of a decision by the South Carolina Department of Health \r\n  and Environmental Controlâ€™s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management \r\n  which denied him a permit to construct a private dock.Â  After Brookgreen Gardens \r\n  and the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism intervened \r\n  in the appeal, the administrative law judge affirmed the denial of the permit.Â  \r\n  On appeal to the circuit court, the findings of the administrative law judge \r\n  were affirmed.Â  DuRant appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDuRant and another individual are co-owners of \r\n  two lots located across from Huntington Beach State Park and bounded by Oaks \r\n  Creek and a marsh.Â  The deed to this property does not reference the high water \r\n  mark of the marsh.Â  DuRant applied to the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource \r\n  Management (Resource Management) for a permit to construct a private walkway \r\n  from one of the lots to a fixed pier head and a floating dock. \r\n  [1] Â  There are no private docks or piers located along Oaks Creek.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation, \r\n  and Tourism (Department) â€“ through Huntington Beach State Park â€“ conducts kayak \r\n  excursions along Oaks Creek and the marsh.Â  The Department also has a bird-watching \r\n  program that conducts tours in this marsh area, as it is a habitat for many \r\n  birds. \r\nThe Department has leased the land upon which Huntington \r\n  Beach State Park is located from Brookgreen Gardens (Brookgreen) since 1960.Â  \r\n  Because Oaks Creek is a boundary of this leased property, it abuts DuRantâ€™s \r\n  lots.Â  Brookgreen has record title to the marsh around Oaks Creek from a deed \r\n  recorded in 1938.Â  The deed specifically conveyed to Brookgreen â€œall right, \r\n  title and interest of the grantors of, in and to the beds of . . . Main or Oaks \r\n  Creek . . . and the marshes, mud flats and bodies of water not herein specifically \r\n  named.â€Â  By 1942, the South Carolina General Assembly had designated Brookgreenâ€™s \r\n  lands â€“ including all waters entering those lands â€“ as a wildlife sanctuary.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-11-950 (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe lands owned by Brookgreen \r\n  Gardens . . . and all streams, creeks, and waters, fresh, salt or mixed, entering \r\n  into the lands are established as a sanctuary for the protection of game, other \r\n  birds, and animals. . . .â€).\r\nRegardless of the legislatureâ€™s designation \r\n  of Brookgreenâ€™s lands as a wildlife sanctuary, the marsh area at issue is located \r\n  in a 990-acre plot that is part of the State Heritage Trust Program.Â  This designation \r\n  was accomplished by a registration agreement executed in 1985 by the Department, \r\n  Brookgreen, and the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department. [2] Â  The agreement provides that this property, \r\n  like all Heritage Trust sites, is to be maintained â€œin its essential natural \r\n  state.â€ \r\nBased on all of this information, Resource Management \r\n  denied DuRantâ€™s dock and permit application, finding the marsh area at issue \r\n  was a Geographical Area of Particular Concern (GAPC) under the Coastal Zone \r\n  Management Act, and thus entitled to heightened protection. [3] Â  This decision to find the property was a GAPC \r\n  was supported by two findings:Â  (1) the marsh area is a portion of the property \r\n  managed by the Department as a State Park, and (2) the marsh area is part of \r\n  the property included in the Heritage Trust Program. \r\nDuRant appealed Resource Managementâ€™s denial to \r\n  the Administrative Law Judge Division.Â  The Department and Brookgreen were subsequently \r\n  permitted to intervene. [4] Â  The administrative law judge \r\n  (ALJ) affirmed Resource Managementâ€™s denial of the permit application.Â  DuRant \r\n  then appealed this decision to the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (Appellate \r\n  Panel).Â  After a hearing based upon the record presented to the ALJ, the Appellate \r\n  Panel adopted and affirmed the ALJâ€™s order.Â  DuRant appealed the Appellate Panelâ€™s \r\n  decision to the circuit court.Â  After a hearing based upon the record presented \r\n  to the court, the circuit court judge affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s order.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\n  In an appeal of the final decision of an administrative \r\n    agency pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, the standard for appellate \r\n    review to the Appellate Panel is whether the ALJâ€™s findings are supported \r\n    by substantial evidence under section 1-23-610(D).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(D) \r\n    (Supp. 2003);Â  Dorman v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n    350 S.C. 159, 165, 565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In determining whether \r\n    the ALJâ€™s decision was supported by substantial evidence, this court need \r\n    only find, looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence from which reasonable \r\n    minds could reach the same conclusion that the administrative agency reached.Â  \r\n    Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 353, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391 \r\n    (1995).Â  The mere possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from \r\n    the evidence does not prevent a finding from being supported by substantial \r\n    evidence.Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    I.\r\n    DuRant argues the circuit court erred in finding Respondents \r\n      â€“ specifically Resource Management â€“ followed proper legal procedure in \r\n      denying the dock permit application and declaring the marsh area at issue \r\n      a GAPC.Â  DuRant argues Resource Management could not declare the marsh a \r\n      GAPC unless Brookgreen established title to the marsh and challenged the \r\n      dock permit application.Â  We do not agree.\r\n    Initially, we address DuRantâ€™s apparent contention \r\n      that Resource Management should have been able to somehow discount or void \r\n      both the Heritage Trust registration agreement and the lease of the Huntington \r\n      Beach State Park property from Brookgreen to the Department.Â  Clearly, Resource \r\n      Management, as an office within the state agency of the Department of Health \r\n      and Environmental Control (DHEC), must act only within the authority granted \r\n      to it by the legislature.Â  See, e.g., City of Rock Hill v. S.C. \r\n      Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 302 S.C. 161, 165, 394 S.E.2d \r\n      327, 330 (1990) (â€œAs creatures of statute, regulatory bodies such as DHEC \r\n      possess only those powers which are specifically delineated.â€) (citation \r\n      omitted).Â  Resource Managementâ€™s authority is set out in the Coastal Zone \r\n      Management Act (the Act).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-39-10 to -360 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n      The Act does not mention, however, any power vested in Resource Management \r\n      to void, discount, or overlook a contract.Â  This is especially relevant \r\n      in the instant case as Resource Management was not a party to either the \r\n      registration agreement or the lease.Â  \r\n    Regardless, we find Resource Management followed \r\n      proper procedure in denying DuRantâ€™s dock permit application.Â  The Act specifically \r\n      defines â€œcritical areasâ€ to include marshes contiguous or adjacent to coastal \r\n      waters.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-39-10(G), (J)(2) (Supp. 2003).Â  The Act further \r\n      states that one cannot â€œutilize a critical area for a use other than the \r\n      use the critical area was devoted toâ€ without getting approval from Resource \r\n      Management.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-130(A) (Supp. 2003).Â  The Act then sets \r\n      forth several considerations to be taken into account by Resource Management \r\n      in determining whether to grant such approval.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150 \r\n      (Supp. 2003).Â  Two such considerations are the extent to which development \r\n      could affect existing public access and the extent to which the proposed \r\n      use could affect the adjacent owners.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-39-150(A)(5), \r\n      (10). (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n    In reviewing DuRantâ€™s permit application, Resource \r\n      Management necessarily had to determine whether the area is a GAPC.Â  In \r\n      fact, with regard to issues involving â€œcritical areasâ€ such as marshes, \r\n      Resource Management must be guided by â€œ[t]he extent and significance of \r\n      negative impactsâ€ on GAPCs.Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-11(C)(3) (Supp. \r\n      2003).Â  Moreover, Resource Managementâ€™s Coastal Management Program (CMP) \r\n      document [5]  lists eight specific types of \r\n      properties that are GAPCs â€“ two of these properties are Heritage Trust sites \r\n      and State Parks.Â Â Â  \r\n    We find Resource Management properly reviewed \r\n      all of these statutory considerations in determining the marsh area in question \r\n      was a â€œcritical areaâ€ and a GAPC.Â  First, it is clear the marsh abutting \r\n      DuRantâ€™s property was a â€œcritical areaâ€ under section 48-39-10.Â  As such, \r\n      any alteration to this area â€“ such as the construction of a dock â€“ required \r\n      Resource Management approval under section 48-39-150.Â  Accordingly, Resource \r\n      Management examined the considerations set forth in that section.Â  The Department \r\n      regularly used the Oaks Creek area â€“ including the marshes â€“ for kayak excursions \r\n      and bird-watching trips from Huntington Beach State Park.Â  It is clear the \r\n      construction of a dock would affect both public access to the marsh and \r\n      the adjacent landowners.Â  \r\n    Second, we find it is equally clear the subject \r\n      marsh qualifies as a GAPC.Â  Regulation 30-1(D)(22) defines GAPCs as consisting \r\n      of â€œareas where activities, development, or facilities depend on proximity \r\n      to coastal waters, in terms of use or access.â€Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. \r\n      30-1(D)(22) (Supp. 2003).Â  The marsh on Oaks Creek certainly satisfies this \r\n      definition.Â  The Departmentâ€™s activities conducted on the creek and in the \r\n      marshes clearly depend upon the proximity to coastal waters and to the State \r\n      Park.Â  In addition, the designation of the State Park property (including \r\n      the marshes along Oaks Creek) as Heritage Trust property would arguably \r\n      classify the land as an area of â€œcultural significance,â€ which is another \r\n      description of a GAPC under Regulation 30-1(D)(22).Â  Furthermore, it was \r\n      noted by Resource Managment, the ALJ, the Appellate Panel, and the circuit \r\n      court judge that the Coastal Management Program document states both Heritage \r\n      Trust properties and State Parks qualify as GAPCs.Â  Thus, as the marsh in \r\n      question is along Oaks Creek, and Oaks Creek is a border of a State Park, \r\n      that marsh can be brought in under the GAPC status.Â  In any case, as the \r\n      CMP specifies that Heritage Trust sites and State Parks are GAPCs â€“ and \r\n      Huntington Beach State Park undoubtedly qualifies as both â€“ the marsh along \r\n      Oaks Creek would be part of that GAPC.\r\n    Therefore, at a minimum, the land abutting \r\n      Oaks Creek that is managed by the Department as Huntington Beach State Park \r\n      qualifies as a GAPC.Â  The Coastal Management Program document clearly states \r\n      that â€œwhen a project overlaps with, is adjacent to, or significantly affects \r\n      a GAPC, [Resource Management] will carefully evaluateâ€ the project, and \r\n      the project would be prohibited if it would â€œpermanently disrupt the use \r\n      of priority for the designated area.â€ [6] Â  As the subject marshes are adjacent to the State Park, it \r\n      was within Resource Managementâ€™s authority to prohibit DuRantâ€™s proposed \r\n      dock.Â  Resource Management concluded the construction of the dock would \r\n      permanently disrupt the ability of the Department to utilize the State Park \r\n      for recreational and educational opportunities along the Oaks Creek marsh.Â  \r\n      As such, Resource Management found the marshes along DuRantâ€™s property were \r\n      a part of the GAPC designated as Huntington Beach State Park.Â Â Â  \r\n    We further find that both Respondents and DuRant \r\n      followed all application and notice provisions.Â  The Act specifies that, \r\n      prior to any construction in a â€œcritical area,â€ notice must be published \r\n      to the adjoining landowners.Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-2(B)(5), (B)(7), \r\n      (I)(2) (Supp. 2003).Â  These landowners can then file written comments about \r\n      the project.Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-2(E) (Supp. 2003).Â  If an adjoining \r\n      landowner objects based upon an ownership dispute, the landowner may file \r\n      an action against the State.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-220(A) (Supp. \r\n      2003) (â€œAny person claiming an interest in the tidelands . . . may institute \r\n      an action against the State of South Carolina for the purpose of determining \r\n      the existence of any right, title or interest of such person in and to such \r\n      tidelands as against the State.â€).Â  If neither written objection is received, \r\n      nor action instituted pursuant to section 48-39-220(A), â€œthe permit will \r\n      be processed pursuant to law.â€Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-2(I)(3) (Supp. \r\n      2003).Â  \r\n    In the instant case, Brookgreen, as the owner \r\n      of the land leased to the Department, was an adjoining landowner to DuRantâ€™s \r\n      proposed dock.Â  Brookgreen was notified and objected with written comments.Â  \r\n      Brookgreen, however, did not institute an action to establish title under \r\n      section 48-39-220(A), and DuRantâ€™s dock permit application was processed \r\n      by Resource Management.Â  While DuRant argues that Brookgreenâ€™s failure to \r\n      file suit against the State is an admission that it does not have a title \r\n      interest in the property, we find this argument is without merit.Â  DHEC \r\n      regulations clearly state that, without written proof of filing a court \r\n      action, a permit application will be processed.Â  That is precisely what \r\n      happened in this case.&nbsp;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    Thus we find that, whether or not Brookgreen \r\n      has record title to the subject marsh abutting DuRantâ€™s property, Resource \r\n      Management properly determined the area had GAPC status as both a Heritage \r\n      Trust site and a state park.Â  Further, at a minimum, we note Brookgreen \r\n      has colorable title to the area in question.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of \r\n      Parks, Recreation, &amp; Tourism v. Brookgreen Gardens, 309 S.C. 388, \r\n      394, 424 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1992) (concluding Brookgreen â€œpossesses title \r\n      in the land, known as Huntington Beach, in fee simple absoluteâ€).\r\n    Accordingly, the circuit court did not err \r\n      in finding Respondents followed proper procedure in denying the dock permit \r\n      application and declaring the marsh area was a GAPC.\r\n    II.\r\n    DuRant argues the circuit court erred in finding Respondentsâ€™ \r\n      actions did not violate DuRantâ€™s rights of due process and equal protection.Â  \r\n      We do not agree.\r\n    While DuRant made vague comments about â€œsome \r\n      Constitutional claimsâ€ to the ALJ, he did not raise the specific issues \r\n      of either due process or equal protection at that time.Â  In fact, DuRant \r\n      informed the ALJ that, with regard to these Constitutional issues, he would \r\n      â€œreserve [them] for circuit court.â€Â  However, these issues were never raised \r\n      or ruled upon by the ALJ, the Appellate Panel, or the circuit court.Â  Accordingly, \r\n      DuRantâ€™s issues concerning the violation of his due process and equal protection \r\n      rights are not preserved for review by this court.Â  See Wilder \r\n      Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is \r\n      axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but \r\n      must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved \r\n      for appellate review.â€).Â Â Â  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    Reviewing the evidence in the record, it is \r\n      apparent that Resource Management followed all applicable procedures in \r\n      reviewing and denying DuRantâ€™s permit application.Â  Resource Management \r\n      determined that the marsh was a GAPC, entitled to heightened protection, \r\n      because it was a Heritage Trust property and a state park.Â  The substantial \r\n      evidence in the record supports this finding.Â  Accordingly, the circuit \r\n      courtâ€™s order affirming the decision of the Coastal Zone Management Appellate \r\n      Panel is\r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\n    HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n    \r\n     \r\n       \r\n        [1]  The lotsâ€™ co-owner was not listed on this application.\r\n    \r\n     \r\n       \r\n        [2]  This department was eventually succeeded by the South Carolina \r\n        Department of Natural Resources.\r\n    \r\n     \r\n       \r\n        [3] Â  GAPCs are areas within the stateâ€™s coastal zone â€œwhich have \r\n        been identified in the Stateâ€™s Coastal Management Program as being of \r\n        such importance as to merit special consideration during Department review \r\n        of permit applications.â€Â  23A S.C.

[3] Â  The targets of the operation \r\n  were Dunbar and his associate, Jonathan Small. [4] Â Â  The informant arranged to purchase five ounces \r\n  of cocaine from Dunbar and Small at a pre-arranged location.Â  Deputies approached \r\n  the car after the informant signaled that drugs were in the car.Â  Small fled \r\n  on foot and Dunbar remained in the passenger seat.Â  Officers found a paper bag \r\n  containing five ounces of cocaine on the floorboard of Smallâ€™s car.Â  After officers \r\n  also found a motel key in the car, Dunbar told Officer Jerry Rainwater that \r\n  he and Small were staying at the motel.Â \r\n\r\nOfficer Rainwater decided to obtain a search warrant for the motel room.&nbsp;\r\nRainwater called the magistrate and discussed â€œthe warrant and the\r\nprobable cause over the telephone.â€&nbsp; However,\r\nRainwater did not draft the search warrant nor go to the magistrateâ€™s office\r\nto sign the affidavit in support of the search warrant.&nbsp;\r\nInstead, Rainwater sent Officer Keith Oâ€™Quinn to obtain the search\r\nwarrant.&nbsp; Oâ€™Quinn was part of\r\nRainwaterâ€™s investigative team but knew only that a drug deal had occurred and\r\nfive ounces of cocaine had been found.&nbsp; He\r\ndid not witness the search of Smallâ€™s car, speak to Dunbar, or speak with the\r\ninformant. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen Oâ€™Quinn arrived, the magistrate was talking on the telephone with\r\nRainwater.&nbsp; Oâ€™Quinn did not relay\r\nany information in support of the search warrant to the magistrate.&nbsp;\r\nInstead, the magistrate drafted the search warrant based on information\r\nRainwater relayed over the telephone. &nbsp;The\r\nsearch warrant contained the following language under the section entitled\r\nâ€œReason for Affiantâ€™s Belief that the Property Sought is on the Subject\r\nPremises:â€\r\n\r\nThat a confidential informant stated that the subject stays \r\n  at motel while in the area, that Co Def stated that the subject left Ramada \r\n  Inn at I-26 @ 378 after Co-Def called subject in that room, that Co Def saw \r\n  subject leave location to pick him up at location across from Ramada, that subject \r\n  had on [sic] his possession a key to said room, that subject delivered approx \r\n  5 oz. of cocaine to undercover agents.\r\n\r\nOâ€™Quinn was sworn and signed as the affiant on the search \r\n  warrant, even though he later testified that the only information he had was \r\n  that five ounces of cocaine was discovered at the drug bust.Â  He had no personal \r\n  knowledge of the other facts in the affidavit.Â  The magistrate issued the search \r\n  warrant after Oâ€™Quinn signed as the affiant.Â  Deputies discovered a bag of cocaine, \r\n  a bag of crack cocaine, $3,795 in cash, two digital scales, and a handgun in \r\n  the motel room. \r\nAt trial, Dunbar moved to suppress the evidence obtained\r\nas a result of the search warrant because it was issued in violation of the\r\nFourth Amendment and the South Carolina Constitution.&nbsp;\r\nDunbar argued the evidence seized in the motel room should be suppressed\r\nbecause: (1) the search warrant was not issued by a neutral and detached\r\nmagistrate; (2) the warrant lacked probable cause because it was signed by an\r\naffiant without personal knowledge and there was no indication the information\r\nwas given under oath or affirmation; and (3) the credibility of the confidential\r\ninformant was not established.&nbsp; The\r\ntrial judge denied the motions, and Dunbar was convicted.&nbsp;\r\nDunbar appealed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n A. \r\n  Dunbar argues the trial judge erred in denying \r\n    his motion to suppress the search warrant because it was not based upon probable \r\n    cause where the affiant had no personal knowledge of the case.Â  We agree.\r\n  The Fourth Amendment to the United \r\n    States Constitution and Article I, Â§ 10 of the South Carolina Constitution \r\n    protect citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Both state and \r\n    federal constitutions provide that search warrants may not be issued except \r\n    upon â€œprobable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,â€ and particularly \r\n    describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.Â  \r\n    U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10; see also State \r\n    v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 290, 494 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1997) (â€œA search warrant \r\n    may issue only upon a finding of probable cause.â€).Â  \r\n  â€œThe magistrateâ€™s task in determining whether \r\n    to issue a search warrant is to make a practical, common sense decision concerning \r\n    whether, under the totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, \r\n    there is a fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found in the \r\n    particular place to be searched.â€Â  State v. Tench, 353 S.C. 531, 534, \r\n    579 S.E.2d 314, 316 (2003) (citations omitted).Â  A reviewing court should \r\n    give substantial deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination of probable cause.Â  \r\n    State v.

Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983)).\r\n  Both federal and state constitutions require \r\n    that the search warrant be issued upon probable cause supported by â€œoath or \r\n    affirmation.â€Â  An â€œoathâ€ is a solemn pledge, swearing to a higher power, that \r\n    oneâ€™s statement is true and subjects one to penalties for perjury if the statement \r\n    is false.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1099 (7th ed. 1999).Â  \r\n    An â€œaffirmationâ€ is a pledge that oneâ€™s statement is true and subjects the \r\n    person to the penalties of perjury, but does not require the swearing to a \r\n    higher power.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 59.Â  Neither federal nor state \r\n    constitutions proscribe a particular method to be used in obtaining an â€œoath \r\n    or affirmation.â€Â  \r\n  A sworn oral statement may be sufficient to satisfy the \r\n    â€œoath or affirmationâ€ requirement of both federal and state constitutions.Â  \r\n    See State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 113, 352 S.E.2d 471, 472 \r\n    (1987) (noting that a â€œsworn, oral statement may be sufficient to satisfy \r\n    the requirement for oath or affirmationâ€); see also U.S. \r\n    v. Clyburn, 806 F.Supp. 1247, 1249-50 (D.S.C. 1992), affâ€™d by 24 \r\n    F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting that it is constitutionally permissible for \r\n    a magistrate to consider unrecorded sworn oral testimony in determining whether \r\n    probable cause exists to issue a search warrant).Â  An affidavit, which would \r\n    satisfy the stricter requirements for a finding of probable cause found in \r\n    our state statute [5] , also satisfies the minimal constitutional \r\n    requirements that probable cause be supported by an â€œoath or affirmation.â€Â  \r\n    See McKnight, 291 S.C. at 113, 352 S.E.2d at 472 (â€œAn affidavit \r\n    is a voluntary ex parte statement reduced to writing and sworn \r\n    to or affirmed before some person legally authorized to administer an oath \r\n    or affirmation . . .

York, 250 S.C. 30, 36-37, 156 S.E.2d \r\n    326, 329 (1967) (noting that an affidavit complies with the minimum constitutional \r\n    standards for the issuance of a warrant upon probable cause supported by oath \r\n    or affirmation).Â  â€œGenerally, affidavits must be made on the affiantâ€™s personal \r\n    knowledge of the facts alleged in the petition.Â  The affidavit must in some \r\n    way show that the affiant is personally familiar with the facts so that he \r\n    could personally testify as a witness.â€Â  3 Am.Jur. 2d Affidavits Â§ \r\n    14 (2002).Â  \r\n  It is not disputed by the State that \r\n    the affiant in this case, Officer Oâ€™Quinn, did not have any firsthand knowledge \r\n    of the events leading to Dunbarâ€™s arrest.Â  Oâ€™Quinn characterized his involvement \r\n    as â€œmerelyâ€ signing for the warrant, without speaking to either Dunbar or \r\n    the confidential informant and without relaying any information to the magistrate \r\n    himself.Â  An affiant is by definition an individual who makes â€œa voluntary \r\n    declaration of facts written down and sworn toâ€ before the magistrate.Â  See \r\n    Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 58 (7th ed. 1999) (defining â€œaffiantâ€ and â€œaffidavitâ€).Â  \r\n    When Oâ€™Quinn signed the affidavit to the search warrant, he swore â€œthat there \r\n    is probable cause to believe that certain property subject to seizureâ€ was \r\n    located in the motel room.Â  Because Oâ€™Quinn admitted he had no knowledge of \r\n    the facts of this case, we hold he could not make such an oath.Â  Thus, although \r\n    Oâ€™Quinn was placed under â€œoathâ€ when he signed the affidavit, he did not relay \r\n    any information that would support probable cause.Â  \r\n  Although sworn oral statements will \r\n    comply with constitutional requirements that a search warrant be supported \r\n    by â€œoath or affirmation,â€ the defects in the search warrant in this case cannot \r\n    be cured by Rainwaterâ€™s oral statements to the magistrate.Â  Rainwater testified \r\n    that he â€œspoke with the judge about the warrant and the probable cause over \r\n    the telephone.â€Â  He did not testify that he was ever placed under oath, and \r\n    there is no evidence in the record that he was under oath when speaking with \r\n    the magistrate on the telephone.Â  Because there is no evidence that the information \r\n    was given under oath, the search warrant issued in this case offends the constitutional \r\n    requirement that it be supported by â€œoath or affirmation.â€Â  See York, \r\n    250 S.C. at 36, 156 S.E.2d at 328 (finding a sheriffâ€™s testimony that he had \r\n    a â€œconversationâ€ with a magistrate was insufficient to establish that the \r\n    sheriff furnished information under oath or affirmation); State v. Wimbush, \r\n    9 S.C. 309, 316 (1877) (finding a warrant illegal where the information on \r\n    which the warrant was founded was not given upon oath).Â Â  \r\n  The State asserts, however, that there is no \r\n    reversible error because an affiant may attest to information supplied to \r\n    him by another officer.Â Â  Certainly, magistrates can issue search warrants \r\n    based upon hearsay information that is not a result of direct personal observations \r\n    of the affiant.Â  See generally State v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, \r\n    614-15, 230 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1976) (finding a search warrant affidavit may \r\n    be based on hearsay information).Â  Probable cause for a search warrant can \r\n    be supported by information given to the affiant by other officers.Â  U.S. \r\n    v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108 (1965).Â  \r\n  The law regarding using hearsay information to \r\n    support probable cause for a search warrant is inapplicable in the present \r\n    case.Â  Oâ€™Quinn testified that the only facts he knew concerning the case was \r\n    that five ounces of cocaine had been found in Smallâ€™s car.Â  This fact alone \r\n    is insufficient to support probable cause to search the motel room.Â  Also, \r\n    there is no evidence in the record that Oâ€™Quinn had any knowledge, either \r\n    from personal observation or from hearsay statements of Rainwater, regarding \r\n    the other facts in the affidavit that would support probable cause to search \r\n    the motel room.Â  Further, there is no evidence Oâ€™Quinn relayed any \r\n    information to the magistrate, much less whether he relayed information learned \r\n    from Rainwater, before he signed the affidavit.Â  Because there is no evidence \r\n    Oâ€™Quinn relayed hearsay information to the magistrate before signing the affidavit, \r\n    the State cannot avail itself of this hearsay exception.\r\n  Inasmuch as Oâ€™Quinn did not have any knowledge, \r\n    either from personal observation or from hearsay, that would support the facts \r\n    in the affidavit and the evidence does not show that Rainwater was placed \r\n    under oath, the search warrant for the motel room lacked probable cause and \r\n    the trial judge erred in denying Dunbarâ€™s motion to suppress.Â  \r\n  B.\r\n  Dunbar argues the trial judge erred in failing \r\n    to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant because \r\n    the issuing magistrate was not neutral and detached.Â  We agree. \r\n    [6] Â  \r\n  A search warrant may only be issued \r\n    upon a finding of probable cause by a neutral and detached judge.Â  U.S. \r\n    v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 914 (1984). The Fourth Amendment requires that \r\n    magistrates be impartial and severed from and disengaged from the activities \r\n    of law enforcement such that independent judgment is not distorted.Â  Shadwick \r\n    v. City of Tampa, 407 U.S. 345, 350-51 (1972).Â  In reviewing an application \r\n    for a search warrant, a magistrate must make an independent determination \r\n    of probable cause and not serve as a â€œrubber stamp for the police.â€Â  Leon, \r\n    468 U.S. at 914.Â  Further, a magistrate must not wholly abandon his or her \r\n    judicial function and essentially perform a police function.Â  Lo-Ji Sales, \r\n    Inc., v. New York, 442 U.S. 319, 326-27 (1979) (holding that a judge who \r\n    issued a search warrant abandoned his judicial function and was not neutral \r\n    and detached when he led police in search).Â  â€œThe nucleus of the neutrality \r\n    requirement is that the issuing officer not be functioning in a capacity charged \r\n    with the duty of investigating or prosecuting crimes.â€Â  State v. Sachs, \r\n    264 S.C. 541, 553-54, 216 S.E.2d 501, 507 (1975).Â  \r\n  The parties do not dispute that the magistrate was \r\n    the party responsible for drafting the fact section of the affidavit.Â  Though \r\n    Officer Rainwater relayed certain facts, the magistrate himself filled in \r\n    the facts in the affidavit.Â  Despite Oâ€™Quinnâ€™s testimony that he believed \r\n    the magistrate to be neutral and detached, there is no showing in the record \r\n    that Rainwaterâ€™s conversation with the magistrate was under oath or that the \r\n    magistrate accurately transcribed their conversation.Â  We do not know if the \r\n    magistrate inadvertently interposed his own interpretation of the facts into \r\n    the affidavit in support of the search warrant.Â  \r\n  Certainly, this practice is one that \r\n    should not be indulged in by magistrates.Â  If the magistrate had merely drafted \r\n    the affidavit upon the sworn oral information of the affiant and then the \r\n    affiant read over and signed the affidavit, the magistrate would have performed \r\n    more of a clerical function and the question before us would not be nearly \r\n    so troubling.Â  See U.S. v. Steed, 465 F.2d 1310, 1315 (9th Cir. \r\n    1972) (holding that no prejudice had been shown by the defendant where the \r\n    Commissioner prepared and typed an affidavit including the information orally \r\n    supplied to him by the affiant, after which the affidavit was read over by \r\n    the affiant and signed and sworn to by him, because there was nothing in the \r\n    record to suggest the affidavit included any allegation or fact not orally \r\n    supplied to the Commissioner by the affiant); see also Johnson v. \r\n    U.S., 333 U.S. 10, 14 (1948) (holding that assistance by the magistrate \r\n    in preparing the affidavit did not detract from his neutrality, but demonstrated \r\n    it, because the magistrateâ€™s duty is to require adequate factual details or \r\n    underlying circumstances to support probable cause).Â  \r\n  The magistrateâ€™s act of recording facts supplied \r\n    to him by Rainwater was not merely a clerical function.Â  Moreover, it was \r\n    compounded by the lack of evidence that he ever placed Rainwater under oath \r\n    or that he ever determined whether Oâ€™Quinn had any knowledge of the facts \r\n    to which he was swearing.Â  Because the magistrate interpreted the facts, as \r\n    he believed them to be, and then summarily determined probable cause existed \r\n    to issue a search warrant without further inquiry, we hold he abandoned his \r\n    neutral and detached role and became actively involved in a function of law \r\n    enforcement. Â \r\n  C.\r\nDunbar next asserts the evidence obtained \r\n    as a result of the search warrant should have been suppressed because the \r\n    reliability of the confidential informant was not established, and thus, probable \r\n    cause to issue the search warrant did not exist. [7]  Â Inasmuch as we have found the search warrant \r\n    lacked probable cause because it was not supported by information given under \r\n    oath and because it was issued by a magistrate that was not neutral and detached, \r\n    we decline to address the credibility issues.Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  There is no indication that the information \r\n    in support of the search warrant in this case was provided under oath.Â  The \r\n    person signing the affidavit had no knowledge of the facts alleged in the \r\n    affidavit.Â  The magistrate abandoned his neutral and detached role when he \r\n    became involved in drafting the affidavit in support of the search warrant \r\n    without placing the person providing the information under oath and without \r\n    determining that the person signing the affidavit had knowledge of the facts.Â Â Â  \r\n    Accordingly, the trial judge erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained \r\n    as a result of the search warrant.Â  \r\n  Based upon the foregoing, Dunbarâ€™s convictions \r\n    and sentences resulting from the search of the motel room are reversed and \r\n    the case is remanded for a new trial.Â  \r\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n  STILWELL, J., concurs and ANDERSON, \r\n    J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n   ANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    I respectfully dissent.Â  The majority concludes the trial court erred in failing \r\n    to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search of the motel room \r\n    because the search warrant was based on an affidavit signed by a law enforcement \r\n    officer who had no direct knowledge of the information contained in the affidavit.Â  \r\n    I disagree.Â  I vote to affirm.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to \r\n    review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d \r\n    827 (2001).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they \r\n    are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d \r\n    105 (2000).Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings \r\n    in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, \r\n    345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  On review, we are limited to determining \r\n    whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 \r\n    S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 391 \r\n    S.E.2d 244 (1990).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its \r\n    own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether \r\n    the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, 345 \r\n    S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; see also State v. Corey D., 339 \r\n    S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000) (an abuse of discretion is a conclusion with \r\n    no reasonable factual support).\r\n  An appellate court reviewing the decision \r\n    to issue a search warrant should decide whether the magistrate had a substantial \r\n    basis for concluding probable cause existed.Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. \r\n    142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App 2002).Â  This review, like the determination by \r\n    the magistrate, is governed by the â€œtotality of the circumstancesâ€ test.Â  \r\n    State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 536 S.E.2d 675 (2000); King, 349 \r\n    S.C. at 148, 561 S.E.2d at 643. Â The task of the issuing magistrate is simply \r\n    to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances \r\n    set forth in the affidavit before him, including the â€œveracityâ€ and â€œbasis \r\n    of knowledgeâ€ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability \r\n    that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.Â  \r\n    Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).Â  \r\n    The appellate court should give great deference to a magistrateâ€™s determination \r\n    of probable cause.Â  State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997); \r\n    see also State v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976) \r\n    (magistrateâ€™s determination of probable cause should be paid great deference \r\n    by reviewing court).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.Â  Requirement of Sworn Affidavit\r\n  â€œBoth the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article \r\n    I, Â§ 10 of the South Carolina Constitution require an oath or affirmation \r\n    before probable cause can be found by an officer of the court, and a search \r\n    warrant issued.â€Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, \r\n    678 (2000).Â  The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution elucidates:\r\n\r\n  The right of the people to \r\n    be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \r\n    searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, \r\n    but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly \r\n    describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\r\n\r\n  U.S. Const. amend. IV (emphasis added).Â  Article I, section 10 of the South \r\n    Carolina Constitution edifies:\r\n\r\n  The right of the people to \r\n    be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable \r\n    searches and seizures and unreasonable invasions of privacy shall not be violated, \r\n    and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath \r\n    or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, \r\n    the person or thing to be seized, and the information to be obtained.\r\n\r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10 (emphasis added).\r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Sufficiency of Affidavit Supporting\r\n  Search Warrant\r\n  An affidavit in support of a search warrant may \r\n    be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations \r\n    of the affiant.Â  State v. Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976); \r\n    see alsoÂ Â  Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, \r\n    4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), overruled on other grounds by United States \r\n    v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980) (affidavit \r\n    for search warrant which sets out personal observations relating to existence \r\n    of cause to search is not to be deemed insufficient by virtue of fact that \r\n    it sets out not the affiantâ€™s observations but those of another, so long as \r\n    a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented).Â  An affidavit \r\n    can show probable cause even when based on hearsay statements.Â  Sullivan, \r\n    267 S.C. at 614, 230 S.E.2d at 623;Â  see also Morris v. State, \r\n    62 S.W.3d 817 (Tex. App. 2001) (information with which magistrate is supplied, \r\n    in affidavit for search warrant, may be hearsay).\r\n  Hearsay, even second hearsay, may provide a legal \r\n    basis for a search warrant.Â  United States v. Welebir, 498 F.2d 346 \r\n    (4th Cir. 1974); see also State v. York, 250 S.C. 30, 156 S.E.2d \r\n    326 (1967) (affidavit for search warrant may be based on hearsay information); \r\n    State v. Elkhill, 715 So. 2d 327 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (finding \r\n    affidavit established probable cause to search defendantâ€™s residence for drugs, \r\n    even though affiant did not continuously observe confidential informant during \r\n    controlled buy; informant was under almost constant supervision of one of \r\n    two officers during buy, and what affiant did not see, the other officer did; \r\n    as long as specific facts are set forth to justify finding of probable cause \r\n    to issue search warrant, those facts may be based on hearsay information).\r\n  The fact that the information provided is double \r\n    hearsay is relevant to its value in determining probable cause, but hearsay \r\n    testimony will not per se invalidate a judgeâ€™s determination of probable cause.Â  \r\n    State v. Taylor, 612 N.E.2d 728 (Ohio Ct. App. 1992).Â  The fact that \r\n    the affiantâ€™s knowledge may be the result of double or multiple levels of \r\n    hearsay does not, per se, invalidate the resulting search warrant.Â  United \r\n    States v. Jenkins, 525 F.2d 819 (6th Cir. 1975); see also United \r\n    States v. One Hundred Forty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Two and 43/100 \r\n    Dollars ($149,442.43) in U.S. Currency, 965 F.2d 868 (10th Cir. 1992) \r\n    (hearsay, even multiple hearsay, may be used to establish probable cause for \r\n    a search warrant); United States v. McCoy, 478 F.2d 176 (10th Cir. \r\n    1973) (fact that affidavit in support of search warrant contains some double \r\n    hearsay and perhaps even a bit of triple hearsay does not in and of itself \r\n    render the affidavit insufficient).\r\n  The fact that there is hearsay upon hearsay involved \r\n    in a case, as far as the information upon which the affidavit is based, does \r\n    not preclude a finding of probable cause.Â  Lewis v. State, 508 S.E.2d \r\n    218 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998); see also Hennessy v. State, 660 S.W.2d \r\n    87 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983) (when viewing the affidavit, hearsay upon hearsay \r\n    will support issuance of warrant as long as underlying circumstances indicate \r\n    there is a substantial basis for crediting hearsay at each level).\r\n  III.Â  Direct Knowledge of Affiant \r\n    Officer Not Required\r\n  The propriety of an affiant attesting to information \r\n    supplied him by a fellow officer has been judicially endorsed.Â  State v. \r\n    Sullivan, 267 S.C. 610, 230 S.E.2d 621 (1976).Â  It is well settled that \r\n    an affiant seeking a search warrant can base his information on information \r\n    in turn supplied him by fellow officers.Â  United States v. Ventresca, \r\n    380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965); United States v. Welebir, \r\n    498 F.2d 346 (4th Cir. 1974).Â  Observations by fellow law enforcement officers \r\n    engaged in a common investigation with the search warrant affiant are a reliable \r\n    basis for a warrant applied for by one of their number.Â  Ventresca, \r\n    380 U.S. at 111, 85 S.Ct. at 747, 13 L.Ed.2d at 690; State v. Hage, \r\n    568 N.W.2d 741 (N.D. 1997).Â  See also United States v. Morales, \r\n    238 F.3d 952 (8th Cir. 2001) (probable cause may be based on collective knowledge \r\n    of all law enforcement officers involved in an investigation and need not \r\n    be based solely on information within knowledge of officer on scene if there \r\n    is some degree of communication).Â  \r\n  Probable cause is to be evaluated by the collective \r\n    information of the police as reflected in the affidavit and is not limited \r\n    to the firsthand knowledge of the officer who executes the affidavit.Â  State \r\n    v. Stickelman, 299 N.W.2d 520 (Neb. 1980); see also Iddings \r\n    v. State, 772 N.E.2d 1006 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (probable cause for a search \r\n    warrant may be based upon information known to the law enforcement organization \r\n    as a whole).Â  A police officer making the affidavit for issuance of a warrant \r\n    may do so in reliance upon information reported to him by other officers in \r\n    the performance of their duties.Â  State v. Pearson, 566 S.E.2d 50 (N.C. \r\n    2002).\r\n  It is not unusual for an affidavit of a law enforcement \r\n    officer to contain hearsay information from another, which, in turn, is based \r\n    on other information gathered by that person.Â  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at \r\n    615, 230 S.E.2d at 623.Â  Hence, when a magistrate receives an affidavit which \r\n    contains hearsay upon hearsay, he need not categorically reject this double \r\n    hearsay information.Â  Sullivan, 267 S.C. at 615, 230 S.E.2d at 623.Â  \r\n    Rather, he is called upon to evaluate this information as well as all other \r\n    information in the affidavit in order to determine whether it can be reasonably \r\n    inferred that the information was gained in a reliable way.Â  Sullivan, \r\n    267 S.C. at 615, 230 S.E.2d at 623-24.\r\n  IV.Â  Efficacy of Affidavit in \r\n    Present Case\r\n  The affidavit in the present case clearly justified \r\n    the issuance of the warrant.Â  Officer Keith Oâ€™Quinn was â€œpart of the initial \r\n    responding units for the take-down of the operationâ€ and was at the scene \r\n    of the arrest.Â  Oâ€™Quinn testified that he had â€œpersonal knowledge . . . that \r\n    a narcotics deal had been performed at the Exxon station on Bush River Roadâ€ \r\n    and that two subjects had been arrested.Â  Officer Oâ€™Quinn had knowledge there \r\n    was cocaine in the car.Â  He declared that, â€œ[b]ased on [his] conversation \r\n    in dealing with Investigator Rainwater,â€ he obtained a search warrant.Â  Oâ€™Quinn \r\n    signed an affidavit based on information which was obtained through a joint \r\n    investigation.Â  When asked â€œ[w]as there a reason for the belief contained \r\n    in the affidavit that there was cocaine in Sheraton (sic) room 158,â€ Officer \r\n    Oâ€™Quinn responded: â€œFrom the information that I gathered that was told to \r\n    Investigator Rainwater by the C.I., yes, sir, there was.â€Â  Moreover, although \r\n    Officer Rainwater actually communicated the information to the magistrate, \r\n    Officer Oâ€™Quinn read over and reviewed the affidavit for accuracy before he \r\n    signed it.\r\n  I find the affidavit was properly \r\n    executed.Â  The affidavit included information Officer Oâ€™Quinn learned through \r\n    his participation in the investigation, as well as hearsay information.Â  Thus, \r\n    the affidavit justified the issuance of the search warrant.Â  Under the totality \r\n    of the circumstances, the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding \r\n    probable cause existed.Â  I would affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow \r\n    the evidence obtained as a result of the search of the motel room.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  The opinion of the majority acknowledges the \r\n    viability of the rule that hearsay is admissible to show probable cause.Â  \r\n    This declaration rings hollow because the majority opinion neglects to give \r\n    any efficacy to the rule.\r\n  With etymological precision, the majority in \r\n    cathartic verbiage concludes the rule should not be applied.Â  The statement \r\n    is made that the magistrate never heard the â€œhearsay.â€Â  The record belies \r\n    this averment.\r\n  The judicial embargo countenanced by the majority \r\n    flies in the face of the universal rule of evidence allowing â€œhearsay, even \r\n    second hearsayâ€ to determine probable cause in the magisterial warrant scenario.\r\n  Without question, the appellate entity will â€œrue \r\n    the dayâ€ of the rule adopted in this case.Â  This â€œcourt created albatrossâ€ \r\n    in search warrant proceedings is anathema to the law extant in the field of \r\n    criminal law.\r\n   I VOTE TO AFFIRM.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  The portion of our prior opinion in which we upheld the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n    refusal to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless search \r\n    of the car remains unaffected.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â Â  We recite the facts, as we understand them, \r\n    from our reading of the record.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  Dunbarâ€™s co-defendant is alternately referred \r\n    to as â€œSmallâ€ and â€œSmallsâ€ throughout the transcript.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985) (requiring that a search \r\n    warrant only be issued â€œupon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate . . \r\n    . establishing the grounds for the warrant.â€); see also State \r\n    v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2000) (noting that the \r\n    General Assembly has â€œimposed stricter requirements than federal law for issuing \r\n    a search warrant . . . the South Carolina Code mandates that a search warrant \r\n    â€˜shall be issued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate . . . \r\n    .â€™â€) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â  Although our finding that the search warrant lacked probable cause \r\n    because the facts were not given under oath is sufficient grounds to reverse, \r\n    we address the remaining issues out of an abundance of caution.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7] Â  At best, this argument is underdeveloped in Dunbarâ€™s brief.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3867","title":"Campbell v.

Carr and Ruth Riley \r\n  Glover appeal the master-in-equityâ€™s ruling of specific performance.Â  We reverse. [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1996, Carr, a resident of New York, inherited \r\n  from her mother a 108-acre tract of unimproved land.Â  In 1998, Carr contacted \r\n  the Campbells, who had leased the property for thirty years, about selling the \r\n  property to them.Â  Carr had telephone discussions with Betty Campbell.Â  Carr \r\n  asked Betty Campbell â€œhow much the property went for.â€Â  Betty Campbell told \r\n  her the Tax Assessorâ€™s agricultural assessed value of the property was $54,000.Â  \r\n  On August 6, 1998, Carr and Raymond Campbell entered into a written contract \r\n  for $54,000, which averaged $500 an acre.Â  Raymond Campbell paid an earnest \r\n  money deposit of $1000.Â  Carr did not attend the closing because she felt the \r\n  sales price was unfair.Â  Carr returned the earnest money, but it was refused \r\n  and returned to her.Â  On February 9, 1999, Carr conveyed an undivided one-half \r\n  interest in the property to her cousin, Ruth Riley Glover.\r\nIn 1998, the Richland County Tax Assessor had computed \r\n  the fair market value of the property at $103,700.Â  Raymond Campbell admitted \r\n  he had probably seen the Tax Assessorâ€™s fair market value of the property:\r\n\r\n[Appellantsâ€™ counsel]:Â  Do you know what the tax office is \r\n  carrying as the market value of this property?\r\n[Raymond Campbell]: Not right offhand, I donâ€™t.\r\n[Appellantsâ€™ counsel]:Â  Have you ever seen that number?\r\n[Raymond Campbell]:Â  I probably have.\r\n[Appellantsâ€™ counsel]:Â  Does a hundred and three thousand, \r\n  seven hundred ($103,700) dollars sound right to you as what the tax offices \r\n  carry?\r\n[Raymond Campbell]:Â  That might be.\r\n[Appellantsâ€™ counsel]:Â  Did you tell Ms. Carr about the fair \r\n  market value of the property that the tax office was carrying on that?\r\n[Raymond Campbell]:Â  I think my wife told her the agricultural \r\n  value.\r\n[Appellantsâ€™ counsel]:Â  Didnâ€™t tell her the fair market value?\r\n[Raymond Campbell]:Â  Not at the time, I donâ€™t think.\r\n\r\nThe opinion expressed in the lenderâ€™s Collateral \r\n  I.D. Report was that the property would have sold for twenty-five percent to \r\n  forty percent higher than the Tax Assessorâ€™s fair market value in 1998.Â  This \r\n  would give the property an expected sell-value of $129,625 to $145,180.\r\nBoston McClain, who was qualified by the trial \r\n  court as an expert real estate appraiser, found that the property had a fair \r\n  market value of $162,000, or $1500 an acre, when the contract was executed.\r\nPrior to entering into the contract, Carr had only \r\n  seen the property once when she was a child: â€œI had seen it as a child, and \r\n  it was a long time ago.Â  My parents drove down to South Carolina.â€Â  Carr was \r\n  diagnosed as having schizophrenia and depression in 1986.Â  She has been on Haldol \r\n  and Cogentin for her mental illnesses since 1986.Â  At the time she entered into \r\n  the contract, she was taking ten milligrams of Haldol and five milligrams of \r\n  Cogentin.Â  She has been hospitalized five or six times for depression and schizophrenia. \r\n\r\nSchizophrenia is a psychotic disorder, which is \r\n  characterized by disturbances in perception, inferential thinking, language \r\n  and communication, behavioral monitoring, affect, fluency and productivity of \r\n  thought and speech, hedonic capacity, volition and drive, and affection.Â  Diagnostic \r\n  and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders:Â  DSM-IV 274 (4th \r\n  ed. 1994).Â  The symptoms of schizophrenia are delusions, hallucinations, and \r\n  grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.Â  Id. at 275.Â  â€œDisorganized \r\n  thinking (â€˜formal thought disorder,â€™ â€˜loosening of associationsâ€™) has been argued \r\n  by some (Bleuler, in particular) to be the single most important feature of \r\n  Schizophrenia.â€Â  Id. at 276.Â  Depression is characterized by altered \r\n  mood in which there is a loss of interest in all usually pleasurable outlets.Â  \r\n  Taberâ€™s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 478 (16th ed. 1989).Â  \r\n  Some of the symptoms of depression are: loss of interest or pleasure in usual \r\n  activities, feelings of worthlessness, self-reproach, or excessive or inappropriate \r\n  guilt, and complaints of or evidence of diminished ability to think or concentrate.Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nRaymond Campbell brought this action against Martha \r\n  Carr and Ruth Riley Glover seeking specific performance of a land contract entered \r\n  into between Campbell and Carr.Â  The master-in-equity tried the case without \r\n  a jury and ordered specific performance of the contract.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for specific performance is one in equity.Â  \r\n  Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 170 n.2, 568 S.E.2d 361, 362 \r\n  n.2 (2002); Wright v. Trask, 329 S.C. 170, 176, 495 S.E.2d 222, 225 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  In an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, \r\n  on appeal the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with \r\n  its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., LTD v. City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œIt is now \r\n  well settled that this court has jurisdiction in appeals in equity cases to \r\n  find the facts in accord with our view of the preponderance or greater weight \r\n  of the evidence, in the absence of a verdict by a jury; and may reverse a factual \r\n  finding by the lower court in such cases when the appellant satisfies this court \r\n  that the finding is against the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Crowder \r\n  v. Crowder, 246 S.C. 299, 301, 143 S.E.2d 580, 581 (1965).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCarr and Glover argue that the master-in-equity \r\n  should not have ordered specific performance of the contract.Â  \r\nâ€œSpecific performance should be granted only if \r\n  there is no adequate remedy at law and specific enforcement of the contract \r\n  is equitable between the parties.â€Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. \r\n  98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000).Â  Equity will not decree specific performance \r\n  unless the contract is fair, just, and equitable.Â  Anthony v. Eve, 109 \r\n  S.C. 255, 263, 95 S.E. 513, 515 (1918); McChesney v. Smith, 105 S.C. \r\n  171, 176, 89 S.E. 639, 641 (1916).Â  â€œThe discretion to grant or refuse specific \r\n  performance is a judicial discretion to be exercised in accordance with special \r\n  rules of equity and with regard to the facts and circumstances of each case.â€Â  \r\n  Guignard v. Atkins, 282 S.C. 61, 64, 317 S.E.2d 137, 140 (Ct. App. 1984); \r\n  accord Bishop v. Tolbert, 249 S.C. 289, 298, 153 S.E.2d 912, 917 \r\n  (1967) (â€œThe rule is well settled that the granting of specific performance \r\n  is not a matter of absolute right, but rests in the sound or judicial discretion \r\n  of the Court, guided by established principles, and exercised on a consideration \r\n  of all the circumstances of each particular case.â€).Â  â€œSpecific performance \r\n  will not be ordered unless the contract expresses the true intent of the parties \r\n  and is fair, just and equitable.â€Â  Amick v. Hagler, 286 S.C. 481, 484, \r\n  334 S.E.2d 525, 527 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  â€œ[S]pecific performance . . . is only \r\n  available to enforce a contract that is fair, just, and equitable.â€Â  Hodge \r\n  v. Shea, 252 S.C. 601, 612, 168 S.E.2d 82, 87 (1969).Â  â€œIn order to compel \r\n  specific performance, a court of equity must find: (1) there is clear evidence \r\n  of a valid agreement; (2) the agreement had been partly carried into execution \r\n  on one side with the approbation of the other; and (3) the party who comes to \r\n  compel performance has performed his or her part, or has been and remains able \r\n  and willing to perform his or her part of the contract.â€Â  Ingram, 340 \r\n  S.C. at 106, 531 S.E.2d at 291.Â  â€œMere inadequacy of consideration is not a \r\n  ground for refusing the remedy of specific performance; in order to be a defense, \r\n  the inadequacy must either be accompanied by other inequitable incidents, or \r\n  must be so gross as to show fraud.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the accompanying incidents are inequitable and show bad \r\n  faith, such as concealment, misrepresentations, undue advantage, oppression \r\n  on the part of the one who obtains the benefit, or ignorance, weakness of mind, \r\n  sickness, old age, incapacity, pecuniary necessities, and the like, on the part \r\n  of the other,--these circumstances, combined with inadequacy of price, may easily \r\n  induce a court to grant relief, defensive or affirmative.\r\n\r\nHolly Hill Lumber Co. v. McCoy, 201 S.C. \r\n  427, 442, 23 S.E.2d 372, 378 (1942).Â  When a grossly inadequate consideration \r\n  is combined with weakness of mind on the part of the seller, a denial of specific \r\n  performance is warranted.Â  Craven v. Williams, 302 F.Supp. 885, 893-94 \r\n  (D.S.C. 1969); accord 81 C.J.S. Specific Performance Â§ 47 (1977) \r\n  (stating that inadequacy of price combined with mental weakness tend to make \r\n  a decree of specific performance inequitable).Â  The inadequacy of price is determined \r\n  at the date the contract was entered.Â  Adams v. Willis, 225 S.C. 518, \r\n  527, 83 S.E.2d 171, 175 (1954); Holly Hill Lumber Co., 201 S.C. at 445, \r\n  23 S.E.2d at 380; Shannon v. Freeman, 117 S.C. 480, 489, 109 S.E. 406, \r\n  409 (1921); 81 C.J.S. Specific Performance Â§ 47 (1977).\r\n\r\nThe rule as to inadequacy of price as a basis for a denial \r\n  of specific performance was early stated in the leading case of Gasque v. \r\n  Small, (1848) 2 Strob.Eq. (21 S.C.Eq.) 72, 80, in these words:Â  â€˜The inadequacy \r\n  must not be measured by grains, but it ought to be palpably disproportioned \r\n  to the real and market value of the property, so as to constitute a hard, unreasonable, \r\n  and unconscionable contract; but it is not necessary that it should be so gross \r\n  as to excite an exclamation or to indicate imposition, oppression or fraud, \r\n  for this would be sufficient ground not only for refusing a specific performance \r\n  but for rescinding the contract.â€™\r\n\r\nCraven, 302 F.Supp. at 892-93.\r\n\r\n[I]t has been held that to warrant denial of specific performance, \r\n  the consideration must be palpably disproportioned to the real and market value \r\n  of the property so as to constitute a hard, unreasonable, and unconscionable \r\n  contract, or so disproportionate to value as to offend the normal sense of fair \r\n  dealing, but it is not necessary that the disparity be so gross as to excite \r\n  an exclamation or indicate imposition, oppression, or fraud.\r\n\r\n81 C.J.S. Specific Performance Â§ 47 (1977).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Craven, the judge found the value of \r\n  the property was three times the amount stated in the contract.Â  \r\n\r\nThe [prospective purchaser] was a lawyer of ability, with \r\n  great knowledge of real estate values in the Lincolnville area based on extensive \r\n  experience in that field, and in the full possession of his faculties.Â  The \r\n  [prospective seller], on the other hand, was advanced in years, living remote \r\n  from the property involved, with access to no reliable information on value \r\n  in the Lincolnville neighborhood, without any knowledgeable adviser so far as \r\n  the record shows, and but shortly released from a mental institution, after \r\n  some six or eight years of confinement.\r\n\r\nId. at 893.Â  The judge concluded the prospective \r\n  buyer was not entitled to specific performance because of the gross inadequacy \r\n  of price coupled with the prospective sellerâ€™s weakness of mind.Â  Id. \r\n  at 894.\r\nThe consideration stated in the contract \r\n  between Carr and the Campbells was inadequate.Â  The $54,000 sales price in the \r\n  contract was significantly below the appraised value of $162,000, the Collateral \r\n  I.D. reportâ€™s expected sell value of $129,625 to $145,180, and the Richland \r\n  County Tax Assessorâ€™s fair market value of $103,700.Â  This inadequate consideration \r\n  combined with Carrâ€™s weakness of mind, due to her schizophrenia and depression, \r\n  makes it inequitable to order specific performance.Â  As in Craven, the \r\n  Campbells, as the prospective purchasers, had greater knowledge of the real \r\n  estate value of the land, having leased the land for thirty years for personal \r\n  hunting and farming purposes, compared with Carr, who lived in New York, had \r\n  not visited the property since she was a child, and had no knowledge of the \r\n  fair market value of the property.Â  Additionally, Carr suffers from mental illness \r\n  as the prospective seller did in Craven.\r\nWe find the contract price of $54,000 \r\n  is inadequate consideration for the 108-acre tract of land.Â  The inadequacy \r\n  of consideration in addition to Carrâ€™s mental illnesses, make it inequitable \r\n  to order specific performance.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the master-in-equity is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n__________\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: (concurring):Â  Although I question \r\n  whether the appellants Martha M. Carr and Ruth Riley Glover proved that, at \r\n  the time the respondent Raymond C. Campbell contracted with Carr to purchase \r\n  the land in question, Carrâ€™s mental illness affected her legal capacity to enter \r\n  into that contract, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse the judgment \r\n  below.\r\nRule 208(a)(4), SCACR, provides in part: \r\n  â€œUpon the failure of the respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court \r\n  may take such action as it deems proper.â€Â  This action includes reversing the \r\n  judgment below.Â  Wierszewski v. Tokarick, 308 S.C. 441, 418 S.E.2d 557 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nHere, Campbell did not file a respondentâ€™s \r\n  brief, notwithstanding substantial questions of fact and of law are involved, \r\n  no small amount of money is at stake, and the case is one in which this court, \r\n  because it is an action in equity, may take its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, \r\n  221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).Â  In short, Campbell offers us nothing.\r\nAs in Wierszewski, this court should \r\n  not be inclined to do what Campbell neglected to do, i.e., â€œsearch the record \r\n  for reasons to affirm.â€Â  308 S.C. at 444 n.2; 418 S.E.2d at 559 n.2; cf. \r\n  Smith v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3868\r\nHeard September 9, 2004 â€“ Filed September \r\n  27, 2004\r\n\r\nVACATED and REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMelvin Richardson Hyman, Jr., of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJames Earle Reeves, of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.: Â B &amp; B Liquors, Inc., (B&amp;B) \r\n  brought this breach of contract action against Jeffery Oâ€™Neil (Oâ€™Neil).Â  The \r\n  trial court granted B&amp;B summary judgment in a one-sentence form order.Â  \r\n  We vacate the order and remand to the circuit court.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nÂ On February 27, 2000, Oâ€™Neil contracted with B&amp;B through its sole officer \r\n  and shareholder, Bruce Meadows (Meadows), to purchase a liquor business.Â  The \r\n  contract called for an up-front payment of $30,000, thirty-six monthly payments \r\n  of $2,566, and a balloon payment of $102,136 due at the end of the thirty-six \r\n  months.Â  The contract further provided that if a monthly payment was more than \r\n  ten days overdue, the interest rate would increase from nine and one-half percent \r\n  to fourteen percent.Â  If payment was more than thirty days late, the entire \r\n  balance would become due.Â  \r\nFrom April 1, 2000 through September 1, 2000, Oâ€™Neil made the required monthly \r\n  payments.Â  Meadows died in September of 2000.Â  As a result, Oâ€™Neil missed the \r\n  October 2000 installment but resumed the monthly payments once he received notice \r\n  of where they were to be sent.Â  After missing the October installment, Oâ€™Neil \r\n  fulfilled his obligations from November 2000 through April 2001.Â  However, in \r\n  May 2001, he stopped making payments.\r\nB&amp;B initiated this action on March 8, 2002 to recover the balance due \r\n  under the contract plus prejudgment interest.Â  Oâ€™Neil answered and counterclaimed \r\n  alleging mistake, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.Â  \r\nB&amp;B filed a motion for \r\n  summary judgment contending the amount owed was not contested and there was \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact in the case.Â  A summary judgment hearing was \r\n  set for May 27, 2003, but Oâ€™Neil was not given proper notice of the hearing.Â  \r\n  However, counsel for B&amp;B informed Oâ€™Neilâ€™s attorney of the hearing a few \r\n  hours before it was to take place.Â  Oâ€™Neilâ€™s counsel attended in order to avoid \r\n  delay, requesting only that he be given time to submit affidavits and memoranda \r\n  pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  \r\nAfter hearing the arguments, the trial judge allowed \r\n  Oâ€™Neil ten daysâ€”or until June 6, 2003â€”to file documents in opposition to the \r\n  summary judgment motion.Â  On June 4, 2003, Oâ€™Neil filed by mail a memorandum \r\n  and an accompanying affidavit.Â  Copies were mailed to the judge on the same \r\n  day.Â  The clerk of court received and filed the documents on June 6, 2003.Â  \r\n\r\nOâ€™Neilâ€™s affidavit included his testimony that \r\n  Meadows provided him incorrect sales and income figures.Â  Oâ€™Neil attached a \r\n  tax return for the year 1998 and a sales report for that same year which reveal \r\n  discrepant sales, costs, and profit accounts.Â  According to the affidavit, Meadows \r\n  gave Oâ€™Neil the sales report before the sale.Â  Not until after Oâ€™Neil took over \r\n  the business did he discover the tax return.Â  He stated Meadows gave him other \r\n  incorrect documents which had been lost. Â Oâ€™Neil averred his accountant could \r\n  attest to the lost documents, but he did not provide an affidavit by his accountant.Â  \r\n  Finally, he testified that Meadows made a number of false statements to him \r\n  in connection with the sale of the business.\r\nOn June 4, 2003â€”presumably prior to receipt of \r\n  the memorandum and affidavit from Oâ€™Neilâ€”the trial judge signed the form order \r\n  granting summary judgment to B&amp;B.Â  The clerk of court filed the order on \r\n  June 6, 2003, the day the documents were due.Â  The courtâ€™s form order stated:Â  \r\n  â€œPlaintiffâ€™s motion for summary judgment is granted.â€Â  This appeal follows. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate \r\n  court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP. White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., Inc., Op. No. 25849 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. Filed August 9, 2004) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 19); Redwend Ltd. \r\n  Partnership v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 468, 581 S.E.2d 496, 501 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003), cert. denied (March 18, 2004) (citation omitted).Â  Summary judgment \r\n  is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  White at *19; Redwend \r\n  at 467, 581 S.E.2d at 501. \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Redwend \r\n  at 467-68, 581 S.E.2d at 501.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of \r\n  fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Vermeer \r\n  Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œOnce the moving party carries its initial burden, the opposing \r\n  party must, under Rule 56(e), do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical \r\n  doubt as to the material facts but must come forward with specific facts showing \r\n  there is a genuine issue for trial.â€ Hedgepath v. American Te. &amp; \r\n  Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 354, 559 S.E.2d 327, 335 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal \r\n  quotation marks omitted).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further \r\n  inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of \r\n  the law.Â  Vermeer Â atÂ  59, 518 S.E.2d at 305.Â  Even when there is no \r\n  dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences \r\n  to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Hall v. Fedor, \r\n  349 S.C. 169, 173-174, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œMoreover, summary \r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.â€Â  Redwend \r\n  at 469, 581 S.E.2d at 501 (citations omitted).Â  â€œHowever, when plain, palpable, \r\n  and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary \r\n  judgment should be granted.â€ Hedgepath at 355, 559 S.E.2d at 336.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs a threshold consideration, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order fails to set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  By filing \r\n  a form order with no analysis, the court does not provide us an order we can \r\n  fully review.Â  In Bowen v. Lee Process Systems Co., 342 S.C. 232, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 2000), we explained:Â  \r\n\r\nOn appeal from the grant of summary judgment, an appellate \r\n  court must determine whether the trial courtâ€™s stated grounds for its decision \r\n  are supported by the record.Â  It is our duty to undertake a thorough and meaningful \r\n  review of the trial court's order and the entire record on appeal. Where, as \r\n  here, the trial court fails to articulate the reasons for its action on the \r\n  record or enter a written order outlining its rationale, we simply cannot perform \r\n  our designated function. \r\n\r\nId. at 235-36, 536 S.E.2d at 87-88 (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\nIn its memorandum in support of summary judgment, \r\n  B&amp;B claims Oâ€™Neil could not rely on any representations due to a clause \r\n  in the contract.Â  Additionally, B&amp;B contends the statements allegedly made \r\n  by Meadows are barred by the Dead Manâ€™s Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-11-20 (1985).Â  \r\n  Due to the perfunctory and conclusory nature of the trial judgeâ€™s form order, \r\n  we cannot determine the weight given to these arguments as juxtaposed to Oâ€™Neilâ€™s \r\n  claims of mistake, misrepresentation, and fraud outlined in his memorandum and \r\n  affidavit. \r\nIndeed, based on the dates of the judgeâ€™s signature \r\n  and the filing of the order, we cannot determine whether he even considered \r\n  the memorandum, affidavit, and exhibits filed by Oâ€™Neil.Â  Although the order \r\n  was not final until the clerk of court filed it on June 6, this filing took \r\n  place the same day the clerk filed Oâ€™Neilâ€™s affidavit and memorandum.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the form order is dated â€œ6/4/03â€â€”two days before Oâ€™Neilâ€™s document submission \r\n  deadline and the same day the documents were mailed to the court and the judge.Â  \r\n  Without a more detailed order, it is left purely to our conjecture whether the \r\n  court considered the filings in making its decision.Â  \r\nAs stated in Bowen, â€œthe trial court should \r\n  provide clear notice to all parties and the reviewing court as to the rationale \r\n  applied in granting . . . summary judgment.â€Â  Id. at 237-38, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 89 (citations and footnotes omitted).Â  â€œIt is imperative, then, that the \r\n  trial court state the material facts it found undisputed and the applicable \r\n  law supporting its grant of summary judgmentâ€ in order for this court to \r\n  properly review its decision.Â  Id. at 241, 536 S.E.2d at 90-91 (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs the trial court has failed to provide this Court \r\n  with an adequate order for review, we vacate the grant of summary judgment and \r\n  remand to the trial court for a written order identifying the facts and accompanying \r\n  legal analysis upon which it relied in granting B&amp;Bâ€™s summary judgment motion.Â  \r\n  Because we decide this case on the issue of the written order granting summary \r\n  judgment, we decline to address any other issues.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nVACATED and the case is REMANDED to the circuit \r\n  court.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3869","title":"Burns v.

M. Manning Smith, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\nRichard J. Morgan and Robyn W. Madden, of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Katherine Burns appeals the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision granting Universal Health Serviceâ€™s (Universal) motion for a judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on Burnsâ€™ action for breach of the implied \r\n  covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  In addition, Burns argues the trial \r\n  court erred in refusing to admit evidence of the deterioration and quality of \r\n  patient care at the hospital after Universal purchased the hospital and took \r\n  over the management thereof.Â  We reverse and reinstate the jury verdict.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n  This action arises out of Universalâ€™s termination \r\n    of Burnsâ€™ employment.Â  The issue before this Court is Burnsâ€™ contention that \r\n    certain hospital policies and procedures created an employee contract which \r\n    altered the at-will employment relationship.\r\n  Burns began her employment with Aiken \r\n    Regional Medical Centers in February 1989.Â  Universal purchased Aiken Regional \r\n    Medical Centers from Hospital Corporation of America in July of 1995.Â  For \r\n    approximately eight years, Burns remained employed with the hospital as a \r\n    nurse.Â  On January 21, 1997, Universal terminated Burnsâ€™ employment due to \r\n    her â€œinsubordinate refusal to meet with the Hospital to discuss a confidential \r\n    patient care issue.â€Â  Burns claims her termination was the result of tension \r\n    between Universal and herself after she expressed concern regarding the quality \r\n    of health care services being provided by the hospital after Universal purchased \r\n    the hospital in July 1995. \r\n  Upon employment with the hospital in 1989, Burns \r\n    received an employee handbook.Â  On February 27, 1989, she signed an acknowledgment \r\n    card indicating she read and understood the acknowledgment card and agreed \r\n    to read the employee handbook.Â  The acknowledgment card provided in \r\n    part: \r\n\r\n  I understand that the purpose of this Handbook \r\n    is to provide employees of the Hospital with general information regarding \r\n    the policies and procedures the Hospital attempts to follow in most cases \r\n    but that neither this handbook nor any provision of this handbook is an \r\n    employment contract or any other type of contract. . . . .\r\n  I understand and agree that my employment at HCA \r\n    Aiken Regional Medical Centers is for an indefinite term and is terminable \r\n    at any time at the will of either myself or the Hospital for any reason.\r\n\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  Additionally, Burns \r\n    signed a Confidentiality Statement in 1989 declaring she understood that violating \r\n    patient confidentiality was grounds for immediate termination.Â  In 1993, \r\n    Burns signed another acknowledgment card and receipt for handbook, which \r\n    stated in part:\r\n\r\n  The purpose of this Handbook is to provide associates of\r\n  the Hospital with general information regarding the personnel guidelines the\r\n  Hospital attempts to follow in most cases, but NEITHER THIS HANDBOOK NOR ANY\r\n  PROVISION OF THIS HANDBOOK IS AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT NOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF\r\n  CONTRACT. . . . .\r\n  All associates at Aiken Regional Medical Centers \r\n    are employed for an indefinite term, and employment may be terminated, with \r\n    or without cause, at any time, at the will of either the associate or the \r\n    Hospital.\r\n\r\n  During her employment with Aiken Regional \r\n    Medical Centers, Burns received Form Number HR116, which set forth the procedures \r\n    for disciplinary actions.Â  Universal adopted HR116 in July of 1995 and amended \r\n    HR116 on August 3, 1997.Â  Form Number HR116, as amended by Universal, is titled \r\n    â€œDISCIPLINARY ACTIONSâ€ and articulates:\r\n\r\n   I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PURPOSE\r\n  To establish definitive policies for the initiation \r\n    of disciplinary and corrective actions and termination of employment.\r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp; POLICY\r\n  Disciplinary actions must be administered in \r\n    accordance with established Human Resources policies, procedures and guidelines, \r\n    and without regard to race, sex, age, religion, national origin or disability.\r\n  Employment may only be terminated with the prior \r\n    approval of the Director of Human Resources or authorized designee.\r\n    III.&nbsp;

Universal Health Servs., Inc., 340 S.C. 509, 532 S.E.2d 6 (Ct. App. \r\n    2000), reversed the circuit courtâ€™s order for sanctions and remanded.\r\n  Thereafter, Burns filed a Second Amended Complaint averring \r\n    breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, civil conspiracy, \r\n    slander/defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Universal \r\n    moved for summary judgment on the causes of action asserted in the Second \r\n    Amended Complaint.Â  Universalâ€™s motion for summary judgment was granted on \r\n    the issue of intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  Burns withdrew \r\n    her civil conspiracy claim.\r\n  Burns proceeded to trial on the claims for breach of the \r\n    implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and slander/defamation.Â  The \r\n    jury returned a verdict for Burns on her claim for breach of the implied covenant \r\n    of good faith and fair dealing in the amount of $32,000 and a verdict for \r\n    Universal on the slander/defamation claim.Â  Universal filed a motion for JNOV.Â  \r\n    Approximately six weeks after the trial, the circuit judge granted the JNOV.Â  \r\n    In his order, the trial judge ruled:\r\n\r\n  Based on this evidence the Court finds that the \r\n    only inferences to be drawn from the trial evidence are: (1) that the hospital \r\n    maintained and preserved the at-will employment relationship; (2) Plaintiff \r\n    failed to identify any policy that she relied on that supports an exception \r\n    to the employerâ€™s preservation of the at-will relationship; (3) that she was \r\n    provided actual notice of the terms of the at-will relationship in conspicuous \r\n    language; (4) at no time during her employment did the hospital ever have \r\n    mandatory language in any document that would alter the at-will relationship; \r\n    and (5) at no time during her employment at the hospital did the hospital \r\n    relinquish the discretion to review any individual matter and take steps it \r\n    believed appropriate to the circumstances.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n    In ruling on a motion for JNOV, \r\n    the trial judge cannot disturb the factual findings of a jury unless a review \r\n    of the record discloses no evidence which reasonably supports them.Â  Horry \r\n    County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993); Force v. Richland \r\n    Memâ€™l Hosp., 322 S.C. 283, 471 S.E.2d 714 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In making \r\n    this determination, the judge must view the evidence and the inferences that \r\n    reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n    party.Â  Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 592 S.E.2d 626 (2004); Small \r\n    v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 494 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n    The trial court must deny the motion when the evidence yields more than one \r\n    inference or its inferences are in doubt.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, \r\n    355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003); Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, \r\n    536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Force, 322 S.C. at \r\n    284, 471 S.E.2d at 715 (stating that if more than one reasonable inference \r\n    exists, jury verdict must stand).\r\n    In deciding a motion for JNOV, the trial judge is concerned \r\n      with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Curcio v. Caterpillar, \r\n      Inc., 355 S.C. 316, 585 S.E.2d 272 (2003).Â  When considering a JNOV \r\n      motion, neither an appellate court, nor the trial court has authority to \r\n      decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or the \r\n      evidence.Â  Id. at 320, 585 S.E.2d at 274; Reiland v. Southland \r\n      Equip. Serv., Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n    A motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable \r\n      jury could have reached the challenged verdict.Â  Gastineau v. Murphy, \r\n      331 S.C. 565, 503 S.E.2d 712 (1998); Welch, 342 S.C. at 300, 536 \r\n      S.E.2d at 419.Â  If more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, \r\n      the grant of a JNOV is improper and the case must be left to the juryâ€™s \r\n      determination.Â  Gastineau, 331 S.C. at 568, 503 S.E.2d at 713.Â  The \r\n      verdict will be upheld if there is any evidence to sustain the factual findings \r\n      implicit in the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 445 \r\n      S.E.2d 651 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The appellate court will reverse the trial \r\n      courtâ€™s ruling on a JNOV motion only when there is no evidence to support \r\n      the ruling or where the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Hinkle \r\n      v. National Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 579 S.E.2d 616 (2003); see \r\n      also Strange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., \r\n      314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439 (1994) (finding that trial court can only be \r\n      reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to support the ruling below).\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    I.Â  Existence of Employment Contract\r\n    Burns maintains the trial court erred in granting \r\n      the JNOV and concluding there was no evidence in the record, no matter how \r\n      slight, nor any inferences to be drawn therefrom on which the jury based \r\n      its verdict for Burns.Â  Specifically, Burns contends there is evidence in \r\n      the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that certain written \r\n      policies and procedures created an employment contract between Burns and \r\n      Universal.Â  We agree.\r\n    South Carolina recognizes the doctrine \r\n      of employment at-will.Â  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 \r\n      S.C. 330, 516 S.E.2d 923 (1999); Shealy v. Fowler, 182 S.C. 81, 188 \r\n      S.E. 499 (1936).Â  Under this doctrine, either party may terminate the employment \r\n      contract at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all.Â  Prescott, \r\n      335 S.C. at 334, 516 S.E.2d at 925; Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., \r\n      352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n    South Carolina courts have carved \r\n      out exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine.Â  See Small \r\n      v. Springs Indus., Inc., 300 S.C. 481, 388 S.E.2d 808 (1990) (Small \r\n      II); Davis v. Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement Commâ€™n, 344 \r\n      S.C. 240, 542 S.E.2d 755 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  First, an employee has recourse \r\n      against an employer for termination in violation of public policy.Â  Small \r\n      II, 300 S.C. at 484, 388 S.E.2d at 810; Ludwick v. This Minute of \r\n      Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985).Â  Second, an at-will \r\n      employee may not be terminated for exercising constitutional rights.Â  Prescott, \r\n      335 S.C. at 335 n.3, 516 S.E.2d at 925 n.3; Moshtaghi v. The Citadel, \r\n      314 S.C. 316, 443 S.E.2d 915 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Finally, an employee has \r\n      a cause of action against an employer who contractually alters the at-will \r\n      relationship and terminates the employee in violation of the contract.Â  \r\n      Davis, 344 S.C. at 246-47, 542 S.E.2d at 758.Â  An employer and employee \r\n      may contractually alter an at-will employment relationship, and as a result, \r\n      limit the ability of either party to terminate the employment relationship \r\n      without incurring liability.Â  See Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., \r\n      292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987) (Small I); Baril, 352 \r\n      S.C. at 281, 573 S.E.2d at 836; see also Culler v. Blue Ridge \r\n      Elec. Coop., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 422 S.E.2d 91 (1992) (emphasizing that \r\n      the doctrine of employment at-will in its pure form allows an employer to \r\n      discharge an employee for good reason, no reason, or bad reason without \r\n      incurring liability).Â  For example, an employee handbook \r\n      [1]  may create a contract altering an at-will arrangement.Â  See \r\n      Small II, 300 S.C. at 484, 388 S.E.2d at 810; Baril, 352 S.C. \r\n      at 281, 573 S.E.2d at 836; see also Davis, 344 S.C. at 247, \r\n      542 S.E.2d at 758 (instructing that in certain situations, termination of \r\n      at-will employee may give rise to cause of action where at-will status of \r\n      employee is altered by terms of employee handbook).\r\n    While the doctrine of employment at-will is \r\n      the law in this state, our supreme court has held that a jury can consider \r\n      an employee handbook in deciding whether the employer and the employee had \r\n      a limiting agreement on the employeeâ€™s at-will employment status.Â  See \r\n      Small I, 292 S.C. at 486, 357 S.E.2d at 455.Â  â€œBecause an employee \r\n      handbook may create an employment contract, the question of whether a contract \r\n      exists is for a jury when its existence is questioned and the evidence is \r\n      either conflicting or admits of more than one inference.â€Â  Baril, \r\n      352 S.C. at 281, 573 S.E.2d at 836.Â  The determination of whether an employee \r\n      handbook alters an employeeâ€™s at-will status is a question for the jury.Â  \r\n      Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., __S.C.__, 599 S.E.2d 456 (2004); Fleming \r\n      v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d 589 (1994).\r\n    â€œThe presence of promissory language and a \r\n      disclaimer in the handbook make it ambiguous and subject to more than one \r\n      interpretation.â€Â  Baril, 352 S.C. at 281-82, 573 S.E.2d at 836; see \r\n      also Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d \r\n      606 (2002) (concluding that summary judgment is inappropriate in most instances \r\n      when handbook contains both a disclaimer and promises); Fleming, \r\n      316 S.C. at 463-64, 450 S.E.2d at 596 (explaining that an employee handbook \r\n      containing both a disclaimer and promissory language should be viewed as \r\n      inherently ambiguous).Â  When an employee handbook contains promissory language \r\n      and a disclaimer, a jury should interpret whether the handbook creates or \r\n      alters an existing contractual relationship.Â  Horton, __S.C. at __, \r\n      599 S.E.2d at 460.\r\n    In Conner v. City of Forest Acres, \r\n      the South Carolina Supreme Court, in an excellent academic review of the \r\n      law in regard to handbook language, edified:\r\n\r\n    Relying primarily on Fleming [v. Borden, \r\n      316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d 589 (1994)], the Court of Appeals in the instant \r\n      case found that summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  We agree.Â  While the \r\n      City argues that its handbook contained disclaimers which were effective \r\n      as a matter of law and that Conner signed acknowledgments of her at-will \r\n      status, the fact remains that the handbook outlines numerous procedures \r\n      concerning progressive discipline, discharge, and subsequent grievance.Â  \r\n      The language in the handbook is mandatory in nature and therefore a genuine \r\n      issue of material fact exists as to whether Connerâ€™s at-will status was \r\n      modified by the policies in the handbook.Â  See id. (summary \r\n      judgment is not appropriate where disclaimers and mandatory promises are \r\n      both found in handbook).\r\n\r\n    Id. at 464, 560 S.E.2d at 611 (footnote omitted).\r\n    Universal asserts the 1989 acknowledgment card \r\n      and the 1993 acknowledgment card and receipt for handbook, both of which \r\n      were signed by Burns, contained â€œlanguage retaining the Hospitalâ€™s at-will \r\n      rights.â€Â  Initially, we note these documents pre-date any legal nexus in \r\n      regard to Burns and Universal because Universal did not purchase the hospital \r\n      until 1995.Â  The acknowledgment cards were prepared by Universalâ€™s predecessor \r\n      in interest, Hospital Corporation of America.Â  Burns neither sued her former \r\n      employer, nor did she have any relationship with her former employer at \r\n      the time of her termination.\r\n    Universalâ€™s reason for immediate termination \r\n      of Burns was â€œfor her insubordinate refusal to meet with the Hospital to \r\n      discuss a confidential patient care issue involving one of [Burnsâ€™] patients.â€Â  \r\n      We have reviewed Category I of the Rules of Conduct with exactitude and, \r\n      indisputably, the reason articulated by Universal for immediate termination \r\n      of Burns is NOT contained within the enumeration of Category \r\n      I offenses.\r\n    Alternatively, even if the court gives some \r\n      efficacy to the documents, there is ambiguity and confliction in language \r\n      and verbiage contained in the handbook. Here, the employee handbook contains \r\n      disclaimers in the acknowledgment cards that the handbook is not an employment \r\n      contract.Â  However, there are hospital policies that clearly promise specific \r\n      procedures for disciplinary action will be followed.Â  Form Number HR116 \r\n      mandates certain procedures in addressing disciplinary problems and terminating \r\n      employees.Â  The use of the words â€œmustâ€ and â€œshouldâ€ throughout HR116 provide \r\n      mandatory disciplinary conditions precedent to termination.Â  HR116 promises \r\n      actions such as a written counseling session, a written warning within twenty-four \r\n      hours of an infraction, a final warning, approval of termination by the \r\n      director of human resources, and recordation of disciplinary actions.Â  This \r\n      type of promissory language creates an ambiguity and leads to more than \r\n      one reasonable inference regarding the existence of an employment contract.\r\n    In addition, Universalâ€™s actions in handling \r\n      Burnsâ€™ termination inferentially demonstrate an employment contract.Â  For \r\n      example, after Burns was terminated, her superiors created a written warning \r\n      in compliance with the handbook and placed it in her file.Â  This raises \r\n      an inference that Universal thought it was required to document the termination \r\n      in compliance with its own policy.\r\n    Our supreme court, in Horton v. \r\n      Darby Elec. Co., __S.C.__, 599 S.E.2d 456 (2004), recently affirmed \r\n      the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to an employer where there was \r\n      no genuine issue of fact regarding the existence of an implied contract \r\n      of employment based on the employerâ€™s policy manual.Â  The trial court found \r\n      summary judgment was proper on the basis there was no contract altering \r\n      the employeeâ€™s at-will status.Â  The Horton court held:\r\n\r\n    Respondentâ€™s manual exemplifies the appropriate manner in which to give employees \r\n      a guide regarding their employment without altering the at-will employment \r\n      relationship.Â  The manual contained conspicuous disclaimers and appellant \r\n      understood those disclaimers.Â  Further, the disciplinary procedure contained \r\n      permissive language and did not provide for mandatory progressive discipline.Â  \r\n      Appellant, who himself had the responsibility of interpreting the manual, \r\n      stated he interpreted the manual as not limiting his ability to terminate \r\n      employees. Accordingly, the policy manual did not alter the employment at-will \r\n      relationship between appellant and respondent.\r\n\r\n    Id. at __, 599 S.E.2d at 460-61 (footnote omitted).Â  \r\n      We note this case is distinguishable from Horton.Â  In the instant \r\n      case, the handbookâ€™s procedures concerning progressive discipline are couched \r\n      in mandatory terms; where as, the disciplinary procedure in Horton \r\n      contained permissive language and did not provide for mandatory progressive \r\n      discipline.Â  Moreover, the appellant in Horton, who was responsible \r\n      for interpreting the manual, acknowledged he interpreted the manual as not \r\n      limiting his ability to terminate employees.\r\n    In the case sub judice, the handbookâ€™s \r\n      promissory language regarding disciplinary procedures, as well as Universalâ€™s \r\n      actions in terminating Burns, give rise to more than one reasonable inference \r\n      concerning the creation of an employment contract.Â  See Gastineau \r\n      v. Murphy, 331 S.C. 565, 503 S.E.2d 712 (1998) (ruling that if more \r\n      than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, the grant of a JNOV is \r\n      improper and the case must be left to the juryâ€™s determination).Â  The jury \r\n      in this case considered all the evidence and returned a verdict in Burnsâ€™ \r\n      favor.Â  Luculently, all factual disputations in the evidentiary trial record \r\n      must be resolved by the jury, not the court.Â  After an extensive \r\n      review of the record before us, we find there is evidence to sustain the \r\n      factual findings implicit in the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  See Shupe v. \r\n      Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 445 S.E.2d 651 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n    The courts exercise great self-restraint in \r\n      interfering with the constitutionally mandated process of jury decision.Â  \r\n      See Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d \r\n      452 (1987) (Small I).Â  Erroneously and in direct contravention of \r\n      the law as it relates to JNOV, the judge in the case at bar obstructed and \r\n      usurped the duty imposed upon the jury to resolve all factual issues.Â  The \r\n      role of the trial judge is to deny the motion for JNOV if there is any \r\n      evidence to sustain the factual findings implicit in the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  \r\n      Indisputably, this trial record encapsulates a plethora of evidence involving \r\n      factual issues as to the existence of an employment contract.Â Â  Consequently, \r\n      the trial court erred in granting the JNOV on the issue of whether an employment \r\n      contract existed between Burns and Universal.\r\n    II.Â  Hospitalâ€™s Actions in Terminating Burnsâ€™ Employment\r\n    Burns argues her termination was the result \r\n      of tension between Universal and herself after she complained about staffing \r\n      issues and expressed concernment regarding the quality of health care services \r\n      being provided by the hospital after Universal purchased the hospital in \r\n      July 1995. \r\n    When an employment contract only permits termination \r\n      for cause, the appropriate test on the issue of breach focuses on whether \r\n      the employer had a â€œâ€˜reasonable good faith belief that sufficient cause \r\n      existed for termination.â€™â€Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. \r\n      454, 464, 560 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2002); Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., \r\n      352 S.C. 271, 283, 573 S.E.2d 830, 837 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œ[T]he fact finder \r\n      must not focus on whether the employee actually committed misconduct; instead, \r\n      the focus must be on whether the employer reasonably determined it had cause \r\n      to terminate.â€Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 464-65, 560 S.E.2d at 611; Baril, \r\n      352 S.C. at 283, 573 S.E.2d at 837 (internal quotations omitted).\r\n    a.Â  Reasonable Good Faith\r\n    The disciplinary procedure set out in the employee handbook \r\n      provided for mandatory progressive discipline.Â  Due to the presence of promissory \r\n      language and disclaimers, the employee handbook in the present case is ambiguous \r\n      and subject to more than one interpretation.Â  See Baril, 352 \r\n      S.C. at 281-82, 573 S.E.2d at 836.Â  HR116 promises that certain procedures \r\n      will be followed when dealing with disciplinary problems and prior to terminating \r\n      employees.Â  Universal did not follow the specific procedures for disciplinary \r\n      action mandated by HR116 in effectuating Burnsâ€™ termination.Â  Universalâ€™s \r\n      reason for immediate termination of Burns was her â€œinsubordinate refusal \r\n      to meet with the Hospital to discuss a confidential patient care issue.â€Â  \r\n      A reading of Category I of the Rules of Conduct reveals that the reason \r\n      espoused by Universal for immediate termination of Burns is NOT \r\n      contained within the litany of Category I offenses.Â  Moreover, the fact \r\n      that Burnsâ€™ superiors created a written warning in compliance with the handbook \r\n      and placed it in her file after Burns was terminated implies that \r\n      Universal thought it was required to document the termination in compliance \r\n      with its own policy.\r\n    Viewing the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n      can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Burns, we find the \r\n      trial court erred in granting the motion for JNOV because the evidence yields \r\n      more than one reasonable inference as to whether Universal acted with good \r\n      faith in terminating Burns.Â  See Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. \r\n      279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding trial court must deny JNOV \r\n      motion when evidence yields more than one inference or its inferences are \r\n      in doubt).\r\n    b.Â  Sufficient Cause\r\n    Universal alleges it terminated Burns â€œfor \r\n      her insubordinate refusal to meet with the Hospital to discuss a confidential \r\n      patient care issue involving one of [Burnsâ€™] patients.â€Â  Universal contends \r\n      it followed its policies and procedures in terminating Burns, specifically, \r\n      the Confidentiality Statement, HR116, and the Rules of Conduct.Â  Burns responds \r\n      by arguing that any claim of insubordination on her part involving a failing \r\n      to meet is rank subterfuge.Â  The jury believed the testimony of Burns and \r\n      rejected outright Universalâ€™s contention.Â  The granting of the JNOV motion \r\n      by the circuit judge is imbued with credibility determinations which fly \r\n      in the face of JNOV responsibilities.Â  See Curcio v. Caterpillar, \r\n      Inc., 355 S.C. 316, 585 S.E.2d 272 (2003) (stating that when considering \r\n      a JNOV motion, neither an appellate court, nor the trial court has authority \r\n      to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or \r\n      the evidence).\r\n    We note the Confidentiality Statement relied \r\n      on by Universal was signed by Burns in 1989 and was prepared by her former \r\n      employer, not Universal.Â  Viewing the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n      can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Burns, we find the \r\n      trial court erred in granting the motion for JNOV because the jury verdict \r\n      resolved the reasonable inferences against Universal.\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    REVERSED \r\n      [2]  and the JURY VERDICT is REINSTATED.\r\n      GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n       [1]  This Court notes the recent amendment to the Code of Laws of \r\n        South Carolina regarding employee handbooks.Â  However, this amendment \r\n        is not applicable to the current action as it was enacted subsequent to \r\n        the institution of this action.Â  Section 41-1-110 of the South Carolina \r\n        Code provides:\r\n    \r\n        It is the public policy of this State that a handbook, personnel \r\n          manual, policy, procedure, or other document issued by an employer or \r\n          its agent after June 30, 2004, shall not create an express or implied \r\n          contract of employment if it is conspicuously disclaimed.Â  For purposes \r\n          of this section, a disclaimer in a handbook or personnel manual must \r\n          be in underlined capital letters on the first page of the document and \r\n          signed by the employee.Â  For all other documents referenced in this \r\n          section, the disclaimer must be in underlined capital letters on the \r\n          first page of the document.Â  Whether or not a disclaimer is conspicuous \r\n          is a question of law.\r\n    \r\n        Act No. 185, 2004 S.C.

Tracy Brown, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nGregory S. Forman, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Sharon Emery (Emery) initiated \r\n  this action against Ross J. Smith (Smith), her ex-husband, to enforce her right \r\n  to 25% of his military retirement benefits.Â  The family court rejected Smithâ€™s \r\n  laches defense and ordered him to pay Emery 25% of the benefits received since \r\n  his retirement in 1991.Â  We affirm as modified and remand. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSmith was in the United States Navy when he and Emery were \r\n  married in 1973.Â  The couple remained married for sixteen years and had one \r\n  child, a son born in 1975.Â  Smith and Emery were divorced on January 12, 1989.Â  \r\n  In connection with the divorce, the parties entered into a property settlement \r\n  agreement on December 12, 1988.Â  The settlement agreement provided: (1) that \r\n  Smith would pay Emery $6,000 in $200 monthly installments, beginning January \r\n  1, 1989; (2) that Smith, the father, would have custody of their son; and (3) \r\n  that Emery would pay $65 per month as child support.Â  The agreement stated:\r\n\r\nHusband is on active duty \r\n  with the United States Armed Forces and expects to retire after 20 years.Â  Of \r\n  this 20 year period, husband and wife have been married for approximately 15 \r\n  years.Â  Husband and Wife acknowledge and agree that they have reached a settlement \r\n  as to the issue of an equitable division of his retirement income in that the \r\n  wife shall receive, on a monthly basis, payable directly to the Wife, by direct \r\n  payment from the applicable government agency, Twenty five (25%) percent of \r\n  the Husbandâ€™s total monthly retirement benefit at such time as retirement payments \r\n  or benefits commence.Â  Husband and Wife understand that this provision is contingent \r\n  upon the Husbandâ€™s retirement and receiving retirement benefits from the United \r\n  States Armed Forces. \r\n\r\nThe divorce decree, signed \r\n  January 12, 1989, approved the partiesâ€™ agreement, adopted it, and merged the \r\n  agreement into the decree.Â  The decree contained the following mandate:\r\n\r\nThat [Smith] provide \r\n  any and all information necessary and sign any and all forms or documents \r\n  necessary or convenient to provide for [Emery] to receive by direct military \r\n  allotment twenty five percent (25%) of the [Smithâ€™s] total military retirement \r\n  (Pension) that [Smith] subsequently receives due to retirement from the \r\n  United States Armed Forces. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAfter the divorce, Smith kept the marital home in Charleston, \r\n  and Emery moved nearby to remain close to their son.Â  The parties apparently \r\n  maintained a civil relationship, but within a few months after the divorce, \r\n  Emery stopped paying child support and Smith ceased paying the $200 per month \r\n  to Emery.Â  Smith retired from the military on June 30, 1991 and began receiving \r\n  retirement benefits one month later.Â  Emery, who remarried in December of 1991, \r\n  did not receive any portion of the pension until shortly after the commencement \r\n  of this litigation, in 2001, when she began receiving 25% of Smithâ€™s benefits \r\n  directly from the government.Â  \r\nAt trial, Smith admitted \r\n  that he did not notify Emery of his retirement or tell her that he had begun \r\n  receiving benefits:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         And did you provide \r\n  any and all information necessary and sign any and all forms or documents necessary \r\n  pursuant to this order to her?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        No, Sir.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Never?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         No, Sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Emery testified \r\n  that on at least one occasion she asked Smith about his retirement benefits \r\n  but was provided no information: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         Did you, at any time, \r\n  ask [Smith] about his retirement and about the money?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         And when, if \r\n  you can tell us, was that?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         I think I probably \r\n  asked him once or twice about it.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         But when was it?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         (No response.)\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         How far back?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         Let meâ€”nine years or so.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         So sometime nine years \r\n  from this date back?Â  So Thatâ€™s 1995, â€™94?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Yeah---\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         Somewhere around there?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Somewhere in there.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         And what was his response, if any, to you?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         I wasnâ€™t given any \r\n  information about his retirement.Â  The date or---Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nEmery averred that she \r\n  suffers from a number of medical conditions, including Anasara (a swelling of \r\n  the body), fibromyalgia, a large hiatal hernia, and depression.Â  Although she \r\n  was able to work as a nurse after the divorce, the depression was so debilitating \r\n  that she mostly stayed at home in bed when she was not working.Â  She claimed \r\n  that due to the depression, she lacked the energy to pursue her claim.Â  Emery \r\n  attempted to discuss the pension with Smith before she commenced this action, \r\n  but she testified he became very angry, causing her to avoid the subject with \r\n  him.\r\nDue to increasing medical \r\n  bills, Emery eventually sought the help of an attorney.Â  She filed this action \r\n  on November 21, 2001, seeking enforcement of her ownership interest, as agreed \r\n  to by her and her ex-husband, in 25% of his military pension.Â  The family court \r\n  rejected Smithâ€™s defense of laches and ordered him to pay Emery 25% of his pension \r\n  from the date of his first collection through the date of her first collection \r\n  directly from the government.Â  Smithâ€™s motion to reconsider was denied.Â  This \r\n  appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the \r\n  court of appeals has jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with its view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 \r\n  S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992); Craig v. Craig, 358 S.C. 548, 595 S.E.2d \r\n  837 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This, however, does not require us to disregard the findings \r\n  of the family court.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E. 2d 610 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial \r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Murdock \r\n  v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Cherry \r\n  v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Effect of the Merger of the Agreement into the Decree\r\nIn Smith and Emeryâ€™s divorce decree, the family \r\n  court judge found that â€œthe parties have requested that this Court should approve \r\n  this Agreement for enforcement purposes and that the Agreement should merge \r\n  into any decree or Order of this Court so as to lose its contractual nature.â€Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the courtâ€™s order proclaimed:Â  \r\n\r\nThat the annexed Agreement entered into by and between [Emery] \r\n  and [Smith] dated December 12, 1988, be and hereby is, adopted by the Court \r\n  as a part of this Decree and is merged into this Decree so as to lose its contractual \r\n  nature.Â  The parties are hereby directed and ordered to fully and completely \r\n  comply with the terms and conditions thereof.Â  It is further ordered that both \r\n  parties shall be subject to the contempt powers and jurisdiction of this Court \r\n  for enforcement purposes in the future.Â  \r\n\r\nBy merging the agreement into the decree, \r\n  the court transformed it from a contract between the parties into a decree of \r\n  the court.Â  Prior to Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 306 S.E.2d 624 \r\n  (1983), South Carolina law was unclear as to what specific language rendered \r\n  an agreement enforceable by the court rather than being merely enforceable as \r\n  a contract between the parties.Â  The Moseley court noted, â€œWords of art \r\n  such as â€˜ratifiedâ€™, â€˜adoptedâ€™, â€˜approvedâ€™, â€˜incorporated and []mergedâ€™, and \r\n  â€˜incorporated without mergerâ€™ consistently have confused attorneys, judges and \r\n  laymen in this state.â€Â  Id. at 352, 306 S.E.2d at 626.\r\n Moseley marked a change in the \r\n  law.Â  Since Moseley, our courts â€œassume that any settlement in a divorce \r\n  decree is intended to be judicially decreed unless there is some explicit, clear \r\n  and plain provision in the court approved separation agreement or the decree.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â Â  The effect of an agreement becoming \r\n  a judicial decree is not to be understated. Â â€œWith the courtâ€™s approval, the \r\n  terms become a part of the decree and are binding on the parties and the court.â€Â  \r\n  Moseley at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627; accord Croom v. Croom, \r\n  305 S.C. 158, 161, 406 S.E.2d 381, 383 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Thereafter, the agreement, \r\n  as part of the court order, is fully subject to the family courtâ€™s authority \r\n  to interpret and enforce its own decrees.Â  See, e.g., Terry \r\n  v. Lee (Terry I), 308 S.C. 459, 419 S.E.2d 213 (1992)Â  (stating that \r\n  the family court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties \r\n  under an agreement incorporated into a family court decree).Â  Indubitably, what \r\n  had been a contract between Smith and Emery became appreciably more efficacious \r\n  when the family court merged the partiesâ€™ agreement into the courtâ€™s decree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Ownership of the Military Retirement Benefits\r\nMilitary retirement benefits accrued during marriage \r\n  constitute marital property.Â  Martin v. Martin, 296 S.C. 463, 373 S.E.2d \r\n  706 (Ct. App. 1988); Curry v. Curry, 309 S.C. 539, 424 S.E.2d 552 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992).Â  Consequently, 25% of all of the military retirement benefits Smith \r\n  has received and will receive belong to Emery pursuant to the 1989 decree.Â  \r\n  She owns that portion by court order.Â  Indeed, Emery has received her share \r\n  of Smithâ€™s benefits since shortly after commencement of this action.Â  Smith \r\n  does not dispute her current entitlement to 25% of his pension.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Laches\r\nSmith argues that the doctrine of laches should prevent \r\n  Emery from collecting her 25% share of his benefits dating back to 1991.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œLaches is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained \r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to \r\n  do what in law should have been done.â€Â  Mid-State Trust, II v. Wright, \r\n  323 S.C. 303, 474 S.E.2d 421 (1996); Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, \r\n  371 S.E.2d 525 (1988); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Laches is an equitable doctrine, which arises upon the \r\n  failure to assert a known right.Â  All Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. Protestant \r\n  Episcopal Church in the Diocese of S.C., 253 S.C. 209, 235, 595 S.E.2d 253, \r\n  267 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his \r\n  rights does not seasonably assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his \r\n  adversary to incur expenses or enter into obligations or otherwise detrimentally \r\n  change his position, then equity will ordinarily refuse to enforce those rights.Â  \r\n  Muir at 296, 519 S.E.2d at 599.Â  The party seeking to establish laches \r\n  must show (1) delay, (2) unreasonable delay, and (3) prejudice.Â  Hallums \r\n  at 199, 371 S.E.2d at 528; All Saints at 235, 595 S.E.2d at 267.\r\nâ€œImportantly, delay alone in assertion of a right \r\n  does not, in and of itself, constitute laches.Â  Rather, so long as there is \r\n  no knowledge of the wrong committed and no refusal to embrace an opportunity \r\n  to ascertain facts, there can be no laches.â€ Muir at 296, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  at 599 (citations omitted); see Brown v. Butler 347 S.C. 259, \r\n  265, 554 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2001); compare Wall v. Huguenin \r\n  305 S.C. 199, 406 S.E.2d 347 (1991) (holding the failure to exercise an option \r\n  to purchase land for thirteen years was not unreasonable and laches did not \r\n  apply) with Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for Lee County, \r\n  315 S.C. 418, 434 S.E.2d 279 (1993) (finding contractorâ€™s six-month delay in \r\n  taking action on its objection to a contract awarded by county to another contractor \r\n  was barred by laches).Â  \r\nThe inquiry into the applicability of laches is \r\n  highly fact-specific and each case must be judged by its own merits.Â  Muir \r\n  at 297, 519 S.E.2d at 599.Â  Thus, the determination of whether laches has been \r\n  established is largely within the discretion of the trial court.Â  Brown v. \r\n  Butler, 347 S.C. at 265, 554 S.E.2d at 434 (Ct. App. 2001); Gibbs v. \r\n  Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 269, 428 S.E.2d 725, 730 (Ct. App 1993).Â  The burden \r\n  of proof is on the party asserting laches.Â  Muir, 336 S.C. at 297, 519 \r\n  S.E.2d at 599.Â  Finally, laches is an affirmative defense and must be pled.Â  \r\n  Rule 8(c), SCRCP; Mack v. Edens, 306 S.C. 433, 412 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991).\r\nThe doctrine of laches is well established in South \r\n  Carolinaâ€™s domestic relations jurisprudence.Â  In Appeal of Brown,Â  288 \r\n  S.C. 530, 343 S.E.2d 649 (Ct. App. 1986), this Court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decree that laches did not bar an ex-wife from asserting a nineteen-year-old \r\n  claim to over $37,000 in child support arrearages, against her ex-husbandâ€™s \r\n  estate.Â  There, ex-husband disappeared in 1963 and ex-wife testified that she \r\n  was unable to locate him until 1972.Â  Id. at 532, 343 S.E.2d at 650.Â  \r\n  Ex-husband died in 1982, at which time ex-wife filed her claim against his estate.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The order of the probate court, finding that ex-wife was not barred \r\n  by laches, was affirmed by the circuit courtâ€™s decree.Â  288 S.C. at 531, 343 \r\n  S.E.2d at 650.Â  Concluding that ex-wife â€œmade some effort to secure support \r\n  from her former husband,â€ we held that ex-wifeâ€™s actions were not consistent \r\n  with an abandonment of her rights, and thus the probate courtâ€™s findings were \r\n  not manifestly erroneous.Â  Id. at 535, 343 S.E.2d at 652.\r\nHallums involved a wifeâ€™s claim to retroactive \r\n  child support.Â  In Hallums, husband and wife separated in 1968, and wife \r\n  assumed custody of their daughter.Â  296 S.C. at 196, 371 S.E.2d at 526.Â  Husband \r\n  initiated divorce proceedings, and in his petition, he stated that he would \r\n  pay $10 per week in child support.Â  Id.Â  However, wife did not respond, \r\n  and the suit was never adjudicated.Â  Id.Â  Then, in 1987, husband again \r\n  filed a petition for divorce, and wife counterclaimed for past-due child support.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Our supreme court, finding that laches applied, reversed the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of retroactive child support.Â  The court noted: â€œThe mother never \r\n  brought any formal adjudicatory proceeding against the father.Â  Since the mother \r\n  had sixteen years during which she could have enforced her right . . . , we \r\n  hold that twenty-two years constituted a delay.â€Â  Id. at 199, 371 S.E.2d \r\n  at 528.Â  \r\nJefferson Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Gum is an \r\n  especially edifying decision as it turned on the existence of a court-ordered \r\n  obligation.Â  302 S.C. 8, 393 S.E.2d 180 (1990).Â  In Gum, husband and \r\n  wife were divorced in 1974.Â  The divorce decree required ex-husband to retain \r\n  his ex-wife as the beneficiary of an insurance policy that he currently held.Â  \r\n  Id. at 9, 393 S.E.2d at 181.Â  In 1980, the parties were back in family \r\n  court with ex-husband seeking a reduction in alimony.Â  Ex-husband was not in \r\n  compliance with the prior order and the judge again â€œordered [ex-husband] to \r\n  take steps immediately to make [ex-wife] the beneficiary on the Jefferson Pilot \r\n  life insurance policy,â€ but he still did not comply.Â  Id.Â  \r\nEx-husband died in 1987, and both ex-wife and second \r\n  wife filed claims for the proceeds of the Jefferson Pilot insurance policy.Â  \r\n  Id. at 10, 393 S.E.2d at 181.Â  The trial judge granted summary judgment \r\n  in favor of second wife finding that â€œ[ex-wife] had not acted with reasonable \r\n  diligence when she failed to obtain a judicial determination . . . after she \r\n  became aware that she was no longer the named beneficiary.â€ Id. at 11, \r\n  393 S.E.2d at 182.Â  The supreme court disagreed: â€œ[Ex-husband] was under a judicial \r\n  order to maintain [ex-wife] as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy . \r\n  . . .Â  In the absence of a modification of the order, . . . [ex-husband] was \r\n  still under an obligation to designate [ex-wife] as the beneficiary of the policy.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nIn Terry v. Lee (Terry II), ex-wife \r\n  first initiated a claim in 1990 to partition her ex-husbandâ€™s military retirement \r\n  benefits based on a 1968 divorce.Â  314 S.C. 420, 445 S.E.2d 435 (1994).Â  Our \r\n  supreme court affirmed the family courtâ€™s dismissal of the ex-wifeâ€™s claim, \r\n  partly on the basis of laches.Â  Although federal law precluded ex-wife from \r\n  asserting property rights in her ex-husbandâ€™s retirement benefits in 1968, by \r\n  1983 Congress had passed legislation allowing a party to obtain property rights \r\n  in an ex-spouseâ€™s military retirement benefits.Â  The Terry II court stated:\r\n\r\n[Ex-husband] retired in 1973, a right to the retirement arguably \r\n  arose in 1983, and now after at least ten more years of inaction, [ex-wife] \r\n  is pursuing this claim on a twenty-seven year old divorce decree.Â  Against these \r\n  facts, it is clear to us that her delay is unreasonable and that the doctrine \r\n  of laches is applicable to bar any further claim against [ex-husbandâ€™s] \r\n  military retirement.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 426-27, 445 S.E.2d at 438.\r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Serv. v. Holden, \r\n  319 S.C. 72, 459 S.E.2d 846 (1995), involved an action brought by an ex-wife \r\n  to enforce a child support obligation imposed in a nineteen-year-old divorce \r\n  decree.Â  There, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the family courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling that ex-husband repay over $32,000 in arrears at the rate of $25 per \r\n  month.Â  The court determined:\r\n\r\nSince the divorce she continually asked Father to pay child \r\n  support, but he refused.Â  She contacted the Attorney Generalâ€™s office and was \r\n  advised that her chances of collecting from Father were â€œnot very goodâ€ considering \r\n  his sporadic work history.Â  She again contacted the Attorney Generalâ€™s office \r\n  when she discovered that Father was employed in Florida, but was told that it \r\n  would cost $300 to file an action for support.Â  Mother did not have sufficient \r\n  funds to pursue the action.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 76, 459 S.E.2d at 848.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the Holden court found that ex-wife was not unjustified in her delay.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Further, because ex-husband was ordered to repay the arrearages \r\n  at a mere $25 per month, he did not suffer prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nIn Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  132 (Ct. App. 1996), this Court affirmed the family courtâ€™s requirement that \r\n  ex-husband repay $30,500 in temporary support based on a pendente lite order \r\n  that was almost four years old before a divorce action was finally tried.Â  In \r\n  1988, the family court ordered ex-husband to pay $500 per month as temporary \r\n  support.Â  Id. at 52, 467 S.E.2d at 136.Â  In September of 1988, the divorce \r\n  action was administratively terminated, and in March of 1989, ex-husband stopped \r\n  paying the temporary support.Â  Id. at 52, 467 S.E.2d at 137.Â  However, \r\n  the family court, in the 1992 action, found that the pendente lite order was \r\n  still in effect.Â  Id.Â  We denied ex-husbandâ€™s laches defense, concluding \r\n  that he was not prejudiced by the delay and had not established laches as an \r\n  affirmative defense.Â  Id.Â  \r\nTurning to the case at bar, we find no unreasonable \r\n  delay.Â  Smith was under a duty to inform Emery of his retirement.Â  He was to \r\n  â€œprovide any and all information necessary and sign any and all forms or documents \r\n  necessary or convenientâ€ in order for Emery to receive her share of his benefits.Â  \r\n  This he did not do.Â  As in Gum, the duty imposed upon Smith emanates \r\n  from the specific provision in the order of the family court.Â  Emeryâ€™s ten-year \r\n  delay in enforcing her rights came as a result of Smithâ€™s own failure to comport \r\n  with the court decree.Â  Smith admitted that he did not inform his ex-wife of \r\n  his retirement, and the family court found credible Emeryâ€™s testimony that she \r\n  did not know Smith had retired.Â  Thus, it was Smith who acted unreasonably by \r\n  failing to honor his duty to Emery.Â  Accordingly, there is no failure to assert \r\n  a known right by Emery, and Smith has not met the unreasonableness element of \r\n  laches.Â  See Muir, 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (â€œThe failure to assert a right does not come into existence until \r\n  there is a reason or situation that demands assertion, for purposes of doctrine \r\n  of laches.â€) (citation omitted). Laches cannot possibly act as a bar to Emeryâ€™s \r\n  receipt of the benefits when her delay was caused by Smithâ€™s failure to act \r\n  according to the decree.Â  \r\nSmith seems to claim that since Emery was able to \r\n  establish her current receipt of 25% of his benefits without any action on his \r\n  part, the duty imposed by the decree was illusory.Â  But this position ignores \r\n  his obligation to inform Emery that he had retired and was receiving benefits.Â  \r\n  Otherwise, the provision of the decree imposing the duty upon Smith would be \r\n  rendered meaningless.Â  \r\nSmith relies on Terry II, supra, as \r\n  support for his laches defense.Â  However, we find Terry II easily distinguishable.Â  \r\n  Terry II involved a wifeâ€™s attempt to establish a right to her ex-husbandâ€™s \r\n  military retirement benefits some twenty-two years after the parties divorced.Â  \r\n  Here, Emery seeks to enforceâ€”not establishâ€”her rights in Smithâ€™s retirement \r\n  benefits.Â  Additionally, the former husband in Terry II was not \r\n  bound by a court order to take the necessary steps to ensure his former wife \r\n  would receive her portion of his military benefits.Â  \r\nSmith cites Henerson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 871 (Ct. App. 1994) for support.Â  Smithâ€™s reliance on this \r\n  case is also misplaced because Henderson dealt with a contempt action \r\n  against a father who had failed to pay child support.Â  The language Smith cites \r\n  comes from a footnote in the dissenting opinion, which mentions the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  criticism of the mother for delaying fourteen years in pursuing the claim.Â  \r\n  Id. at 176, n.2, 447 S.E.2d at 874 n.2.Â  While the footnote briefly mentions \r\n  the doctrine of laches, the issue was not discussed by the Henderson \r\n  majority.\r\nFinally, we note that as an equitable defense, the \r\n  application of laches is a matter of discretion, not of right.Â  Significantly, \r\n  in Brown, Terry II, Holden, and Cannon, the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision regarding laches was affirmed.Â  Of course, an appellate tribunalâ€™s \r\n  deference to the trial court is not absolute, as demonstrated by the supreme \r\n  courtâ€™s reversal of the trial courts in Hallums and Gum.Â  Nonetheless, \r\n  we reiterate the fact-specific nature of the application of laches and give \r\n  credence to the trial judge in affirming her decision.\r\nIV.Â  Smithâ€™s \r\n  Unclean Hands\r\nIn addition to our finding that Emery acted reasonably, \r\n  we agree with her and the trial court that in any event Smith is precluded from \r\n  asserting laches due to his own unclean hands.Â  Laches is a defense in equity, \r\n  and one who comes to the court seeking equity must come with clean hands.Â  See \r\n  Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945) \r\n  (â€œHe who comes into equity must come with clean hands.Â  It is far more than \r\n  a mere banality.Â  It is a self-imposed ordinance that closes the door of the \r\n  court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to \r\n  the matter in which he seeks relief.â€); Wilson v. Landstrom, 281 S.C. \r\n  260, 315 S.E.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œThe doctrine of unclean hands precludes \r\n  a plaintiff from recovering in equity if he acted unfairly in a matter that \r\n  is the subject of the litigation to the prejudice of the defendant.â€) (quotations \r\n  and citations omitted).Â  We find Smithâ€™s hands are unclean because he failed \r\n  to inform Emery that: (1) he was retired; (2) was receiving benefits; and (3) \r\n  Emery was entitled to her 25% share.Â  \r\nV.Â  Manner \r\n  of Payment\r\nThe family court required full payment of the delinquency \r\n  within sixty days of the entry of the order.Â  We modify the requirement that \r\n  Smith pay the full amount in lump sum and remand to the family court for the \r\n  specific purpose of determining the amount of delinquency and to set a reasonable \r\n  and proper schedule of repayment. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, \r\n  we find the trial judge properly found that Emery was entitled to 25% of all \r\n  retirement benefits due to her under the divorce decree.Â  Accordingly, the judgment \r\n  of the trial court is \r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED and REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
