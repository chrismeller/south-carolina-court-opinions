Canteen argues the circuit court erred\r\nby (1) failing to find Canteen suffered from an asymptomatic Chiari I\r\nMalformation prior to July 2, 2001; (2) failing to find Canteen's injury aggravated\r\nher previously asymptomatic Chiari I Malformation; (3) finding no medical doctor\r\n\nprovided evidence Canteen suffered a physical brain injury and disregarding the\r\nmedical doctors' evidence; (4) disregarding evidence of Canteen's physical brain\r\ndamage from herself and three neuropsychologists; (5) finding Dr. Kenneth\r\nKammer's testimony concerning brain damage was equivocal; (6) failing to affirm\r\nthe single commissioner's finding that evidence proved Canteen's physical brain\r\ndamage was causally related to Canteen's work injury, (7) finding substantial\r\nevidence supported the Appellate Panel's decision; and (8) failing to affirm the\r\nsingle commissioner's award of lifetime compensation and lifetime medical care.\r\nWe reverse and remand to the Appellate Panel.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nCanteen was working as a nurse at McLeod Regional Medical Center (McLeod)\r\nwhen she fell in the operating room on July 2, 2001. As a result of the fall,\r\nCanteen claimed she injured her right knee, right leg, cervical spine, head, brain,\r\nright arm, and right wrist. Canteen also claimed she suffered from mental injuries,\r\npsychological problems, exacerbation of a Chiari I Malformation, hemiparesis\r\nfollowing Chiari I Malformation surgery, and bladder incontinence.\r\n\r\nAlthough Canteen returned to work after the fall, she claimed she was unable to\r\nperform all of her duties, leading to her resignation. Sometime after the accident,\r\nCanteen claimed she began having headaches and experienced a \"clicking\" sound\r\nwhen she moved her head. In February 2003, neurosurgeon Dr. Kenneth Kammer\r\ndiagnosed Canteen with a Chiari I Malformation, a condition in which the\r\n\"cerebellar tonsils protrude down through the foramen magnum into the cervical\r\nspinal canal.\" Dr. Kammer testified Canteen's fall exacerbated her previously\r\nasymptomatic Chiari I Malformation, making it symptomatic. However, evidence\r\nwas also presented from two other doctors that disputed the Chiari I Malformation\r\ndiagnosis. Drs. Samuel McCown and Byron Bailey reviewed Canteen's MRIs and\r\ntestified they did not believe she suffered from a Chiari I Malformation. Dr.\r\nKammer recommended decompression surgery on Canteen's brain, which he\r\nperformed in July 2003. Following surgery, in February 2004, Canteen was\r\nevaluated by neurologist Dr. Gero Kragh who opined that Canteen had a Chiari I\r\nMalformation that was aggravated by her fall at work.\r\n\r\nIn July 2004, Canteen filed a Form 50 claiming she was totally and permanently\r\ndisabled with physical brain damage; thus, she was entitled to lifetime\r\ncompensation and medical care. According to Canteen, following surgery, she\r\nregained full range of motion in her neck. However, Canteen testified she had\r\npost-operative paralysis in her right side that eventually improved, leaving her with\r\n\nresidual weakness and numbness in her right hand and foot. Canteen also testified\r\nshe has difficulty with fine motor skills and suffers from gait and balance\r\nproblems. Additionally, Canteen testified she has cognitive difficulties, which\r\naffect her concentration, comprehension, problem solving, multi-tasking, and\r\nmemory abilities. According to Canteen, she has difficulty reading, driving, and\r\nhandling household chores and the activities of daily living. She also testified she\r\nhas difficulty making eye contact and hears voices that are not present.\r\n\r\nDr. Kammer testified Canteen did not sustain any brain damage as a result of the\r\nsurgery. Neuropsychologist Dr. Randy Waid also evaluated Canteen and opined\r\nthat Canteen's fall \"caused an asymptomatic Chiari Malformation to become\r\nsymptomatic,\" and she suffered \"physical injury to the brain.\" Dr. Waid opined\r\nthat Canteen's symptoms were \"a direct result of the fall that rendered her Chiari\r\n[M]alformation symptomatic.\" Additionally, psychologist Dr. Robert Brabham\r\ndetermined Canteen experienced a permanent physical injury to her brain when she\r\nfell at work. Dr. Brabham opined that most of Canteen's \"noted inconsistencies\"\r\nare \"brain-injury related rather than from feigning or malingering, as might be\r\nquestioned.\" Dr. Kragh found Canteen's \"neurologic compromise [] resulted from\r\nan exacerbation of her pre-morbidly existent [Chiari I Malformation] and was a\r\nrecognized risk factor in the decompression of such malformation.\"\r\n\r\nMcLeod admitted the injuries to Canteen's right knee and cervical spine; however,\r\nit denied Canteen had a Chiari I Malformation. On September 12, 2005, after a\r\nhearing, the single commissioner granted Canteen all of her requested relief and\r\nconcluded Canteen suffered a brain injury. Specifically, the single commissioner\r\ndetermined Canteen's accident caused her pre-existing Chiari I Malformation to\r\nbecome symptomatic. The single commissioner found Canteen was totally and\r\npermanently disabled and determined she was entitled to lifetime compensation\r\nand care. McLeod appealed only the single commissioner's findings that Canteen\r\nsuffered a brain injury and that the accident triggered her Chiari I Malformation\r\nsymptoms. On June 26, 2006, the Appellate Panel reversed the single\r\ncommissioner's findings concerning Canteen's brain injury and remanded the case\r\nto the single commissioner for a determination of permanency to body parts other\r\nthan Canteen's brain.\r\n\r\nCanteen appealed the brain injury finding to the circuit court prior to the\r\nproceedings before the single commissioner regarding the remanded issues.\r\nMcLeod filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\r\narguing the appeal was interlocutory because the Appellate Panel had remanded\r\nthe case to the single commissioner for further proceedings. See Canteen v.\r\n\nMcLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009) overruled\r\nby Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control,\r\n387 S.C. 265, 266, 692 S.E.2d 894 (2010). On January 3, 2007, the circuit court\r\ngranted McLeod's motion to dismiss, concluding the court did not have\r\njurisdiction, and dismissed the appeal without prejudice. Thereafter, Canteen\r\nappealed the circuit court's order to this Court. In a July 15, 2009 opinion, this\r\nCourt reversed the circuit court's order dismissing Canteen's appeal and remanded\r\nto the circuit court for a determination on Canteen's brain injury. See id. On\r\nremand, the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel, finding substantial evidence\r\nsupported the Appellate Panel's determination that Canteen did not suffer a brain\r\ninjury as a result of her work accident. The circuit court also determined\r\nsubstantial medical evidence existed that Canteen did not suffer from a Chiari I\r\nMalformation and, in the alternative, if Canteen did have a Chiari I Malformation,\r\nshe did not suffer brain damage as a result of the accident. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the substantial\r\nevidence standard for judicial review of decisions by the Commission. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2011); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276\r\nS.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the substantial evidence standard of review, this\r\ncourt may not \"substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight\r\nof the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected\r\nby an error of law.\" Stone v. Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551,\r\n552 (Ct. App. 2004). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor\r\nthe evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which,\r\nconsidering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\nconclusions the administrative agency reached in order to justify its actions.\"\r\nBroughton v. S. of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 495, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App.\r\n1999). In workers' compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact\r\nfinder. Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000). The\r\nAppellate Panel is reserved the task of assessing the credibility of the witnesses\r\nand the weight to be accorded evidence. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Chiari I Malformation\r\n\nCanteen argues the circuit court erred in failing to find (1) she suffered from a pre-\r\nexisting Chiari I Malformation and (2) her fall at work aggravated her previously\r\nasymptomatic Chiari I Malformation.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner determined Canteen had an asymptomatic Chiari I\r\nMalformation, and her fall in 2001 triggered her Chiari I Malformation symptoms.\r\nThe single commissioner noted Canteen suffered additional symptoms after\r\nsurgery and found she had physical brain damage. Subsequently, the Appellate\r\nPanel, in its order, noted the existence of a Chiari I Malformation was an issue on\r\nappeal. However, the Appellate Panel did not make a specific finding regarding\r\nthe existence of a Chiari I Malformation. Instead, the Appellate Panel determined\r\nonly that the evidence did not support a finding that Canteen suffered a brain\r\ninjury. The Appellate Panel made no reference to Canteen's alleged Chiari I\r\nMalformation in its findings of fact.\r\n\r\nCanteen argues the Appellate Panel's failure to expressly reverse the single\r\ncommissioner's determination that she suffered from a Chiari I Malformation was\r\nan affirmation of the single commissioner's finding by implication. McLeod\r\nmaintains the Appellant Panel's use of the term \"brain injury\" included the specific\r\ncondition of a Chiari I Malformation. We find the Appellate Panel's order is\r\nunclear whether in reversing the single commissioner's finding that Canteen\r\nsuffered a brain injury, the Appellate Panel also reversed the single commissioner's\r\nfindings that Canteen suffered from a Chiari I Malformation.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the circuit court was charged with determining whether substantial\r\nevidence supported the Appellate Panel's findings of fact or whether an error of\r\nlaw affected its order. See Stone v. Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d\r\n551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004). However, the circuit court improperly weighed the\r\nevidence and made its own factual determinations as to whether Canteen suffered\r\nfrom a pre-existing Chiari I Malformation and if her fall aggravated that Chiari I\r\nMalformation. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court and remand to the\r\nAppellate Panel to determine whether Canteen suffered from a Chiari I\r\nMalformation and, if so, whether that Chiari I Malformation was aggravated by her\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nII.   Evidence of Brain Injury\r\n\r\nCanteen argues the circuit court erred in failing to find the Appellate Panel erred in\r\n(1) finding \"no medical doctor provided evidence [Canteen] suffered a physical\r\n\nbrain injury\" and (2) disregarding evidence from Canteen and three \n\r\nneuropsychologists regarding Canteen's brain damage. \n\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel found \"[t]he greater weight of the evidence does not support a \n\r\nfinding that [Canteen] suffered a brain injury,\" and it noted that \"[n]o medical \n\r\ndoctor provided evidence [Canteen] suffered a physical brain injury.\" The circuit \n\r\ncourt determined Dr. Kammer's testimony, which was that Canteen did not sustain \n\r\nany brain damage as a result of the surgery, constituted substantial evidence to \n\r\nsupport the Appellate Panel's finding of no brain injury. The circuit court did not \n\r\nfind, as the Appellate Panel did, that there was no evidence of brain injury. Rather, \n\r\nthe circuit court noted it was within the Appellate Panel's authority to accept the \n\r\ntestimony of Dr. Krammer over the testimony of Drs. Kragh, Waid, and Brabham. \n\r\n\r\nThis court's review is limited to determining whether the Appellate Panel's \n\r\ndecision is unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by an error of law. \n\r\nCorbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002). \n\r\nWe find the Appellate Panel's order is insufficient to enable a meaningful review. \n\r\nThe findings of fact made by the Appellate Panel must be sufficiently detailed to \n\r\nenable the reviewing court to determine whether the evidence supports the \n\r\nfindings. Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 531, 593 S.E.2d 491, 497 (Ct. \n\r\nApp. 2004). Pursuant to the APA, \n\r\n\r\n             A final decision or order adverse to a party in a contested\r\n             case shall be in writing or stated in the record. A final\r\n             decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n             law, separately stated. Findings of fact, if set forth in\r\n             statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise\r\n             and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting\r\n             the findings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2005).\r\n\r\nHere, the Appellate Panel failed to detail any of the evidence presented to the\r\nCommission. The Appellate Panel's findings simply indicate it rejected Canteen's\r\nbrain injury claim because no evidence supported a finding that she suffered any\r\nbrain damage. The record, however, contains conflicting evidence on this issue.\r\nIn light of the various facts and issues presented by this case, the Appellate Panel's\r\nfindings are insufficient to permit this court to ascertain whether evidence\r\nsupported the Appellate Panel's findings and whether the law was correctly\r\n\napplied.1 Accordingly, we remand to the Appellate Panel to weigh the evidence\r\nand determine whether Canteen suffered a brain injury.\r\n\r\nIII.          \"Equivocal\" Testimony\r\n\r\nCanteen argues the circuit court erred in failing to find the Appellate Panel erred in\r\nfinding Dr. Kammer's testimony regarding brain damage was \"equivocal.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding Canteen's brain injury claim, the Appellate Panel determined: \"The\r\ngreater weight of the evidence does not support a finding that [Canteen] suffered a\r\nbrain injury. Dr. Kammer's testimony from the hearing is equivocal.\" The\r\nAppellate Panel failed to cite any evidence to support its \"equivocal\" finding.\r\nCanteen argues the single commissioner correctly believed Dr. Kammer's\r\ntestimony that she suffered from a pre-existing Chiari I Malformation that was\r\naggravated by her fall, but disregarded Dr. Kammer's testimony that she did not\r\nsuffer brain damage as a result of decompression surgery. Canteen maintains the\r\nAppellate Panel erred in rejecting Dr. Kammer's testimony as \"equivocal\" when his\r\ntestimony was neither uncertain nor subject to multiple interpretations.\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel failed to sufficiently support its \"equivocal\" finding in its\r\norder, and therefore, we instruct the Appellate Panel to cite evidence supporting its\r\nposition on remand.\r\n\r\n       IV.            Causal Relationship\r\n\r\nCanteen argues the circuit court erred in failing to affirm the single commissioner's\r\nfinding that evidence proved Canteen's brain damage was causally related to her\r\nwork injury.\r\n\r\nRegarding Canteen's brain injury claim, the Appellate Panel determined: \"The\r\ngreater weight of medical evidence does not show a causal relationship.\" It is\r\nunclear whether the Appellate Panel found there was no causal relationship\r\nbetween the fall and Canteen's alleged brain injury, or between the decompression\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1 Because the Appellate Panel's order was insufficient, we need not address\r\nwhether substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's findings. See Futch v.\r\nMcAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n(ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination\r\nof a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\nsurgery and Canteen's alleged brain injury. On remand, the Appellate Panel should\r\nclarify its finding with supporting evidence.\r\n\r\n   V.    Lifetime Compensation and Medical Care\r\n\r\nCanteen argues the circuit court erred in failing to affirm the single commissioner's\r\naward of lifetime compensation and lifetime medical care. Based upon our\r\ndecision to remand to the Appellate Panel for reconsideration, we need not address\r\nthis issue. See Futch, 335 S.C. at 613, 518 S.E.2d at 598.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Appellate Panel is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5034","title":"State v.

McDonald, all of Columbia,\r\n            for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: On appeal, Richard Bill Niles, Jr. (Niles) argues the circuit court\r\nerred in declining to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter because there was\r\nevidence that Niles was not the first aggressor. Niles asserts the circuit court\r\n\nincorrectly reasoned Niles was either acting in self-defense or shot the decedent\r\nduring the commission of an armed robbery. Because voluntary manslaughter and\r\nself-defense are not mutually exclusive, Niles contends he was entitled to a charge\r\non voluntary manslaughter.1 We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2007, James Salter (Salter) was shot in a Best Buy parking lot in\r\nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina. Salter later died from his injuries. Niles, his fiancÃ©\r\nMokeia Hammond (Hammond), and Ervin Moore (Moore) were arrested and\r\ncharged with murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the\r\ncommission of a violent crime. Moore entered into a plea agreement with the State\r\nwhereby Moore pled guilty to armed robbery, voluntary manslaughter, and\r\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime in exchange for\r\nhis testimony against Niles and Hammond. Niles and Hammond were tried jointly\r\non March 9, 2009.\r\n\r\nAt Niles' and Hammond's trial, Moore testified that on April 9, 2007, Niles and\r\nHammond picked up Moore and headed to the beach where the trio \"made a couple\r\nof drug sales at a couple of motels.\" Moore stated, \"[W]e were smoking blunts in\r\nthe car . . . [and when] we ran out of weed . . . we said we wanted to get some more\r\nweed.\" Moore maintained Niles \"made a couple of phone calls,\" and they \"ended\r\nup in the Best Buy parking lot.\" Moore testified Niles said \"he was going to do a\r\nlick,\" which Moore understood to mean they were going to rob the drug dealer,\r\nlater identified as Salter. Moore stated his job in the robbery was \"to identify the\r\nweed\" for Niles.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the Best Buy parking lot, Moore exited his vehicle and got into\r\nSalter's vehicle. Moore stated Salter pulled a large ziploc bag of marijuana out\r\nfrom under his seat so Moore could see it. Moore maintained that by the time he\r\ninspected the marijuana, exited Salter's vehicle, and returned to the vehicle with\r\nHammond, Niles had exited their vehicle. Moore testified he informed Niles that\r\nhe saw the marijuana and stated, \"The next thing I knew, I just heard two shots and\r\nI seen [Niles], he jumped back in the back seat behind [Hammond].\" Moore\r\nfurther stated \"after . . . [Niles] jumped in [the vehicle], after them two shots then\r\nthe other guy fired a shot.\" Moore testified that after both Niles and Salter\r\ncontinued to fire shots at each other, Hammond drove out of the parking lot.\r\n      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1  Niles did not appeal his convictions for armed robbery and possession of a\r\nfirearm during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n\nThough Moore testified on direct examination \"the other guy didn't shoot until\r\nafter [Niles] shot,\" on cross-examination, Moore admitted he did not actually see\r\nNiles shoot first. Moore stated he originally testified Niles shot first because Niles\r\nadmitted he shot first when Niles jumped back into the vehicle.\r\n\r\nNiles testified in his own defense. He denied he told Moore he was \"going to do a\r\nlick\" and testified Moore asked him to purchase a pound of marijuana for him.\r\nNiles affirmed that when they pulled into the Best Buy parking lot, Moore got out\r\nof the vehicle and into Salter's vehicle. Niles testified he was talking to Hammond\r\nabout their upcoming wedding when Hammond suddenly told him, \"Baby, they are\r\nfighting.\" Niles stated he looked over to Salter's vehicle and observed Moore and\r\nSalter \"tussling in the car.\" Niles stated he noticed Moore trying to exit Salter's\r\nvehicle and heard Salter state to Moore, \"[Y]ou ain't getting out of this car with my\r\nweed without no money.\" Niles maintained that when Moore exited Salter's\r\nvehicle and jumped into the vehicle with Niles and Hammond, Salter pulled out a\r\ngun and began shooting at the vehicle that Niles, Hammond, and Moore occupied.\r\nNiles testified, \"I grabbed my pistol and that's when I shot two times.\" Niles\r\nmaintained he was being shot at constantly by Salter and he shot back.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court charged the jury on self-defense, but it refused Niles' request to\r\ncharge the jury on voluntary manslaughter. The circuit court refused the voluntary\r\nmanslaughter charge reasoning that \"either the victim started shooting and Mr.\r\nNiles was acting in self-defense or Mr. Niles started shooting . . . [and] killed the\r\nvictim during the commission of an armed robbery.\"\r\n\r\nNiles was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime.2 Niles received a thirty-year sentence for\r\nmurder and armed robbery and a five-year sentence for the conviction of\r\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, all to be served\r\nconcurrently. Niles appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Thus, an appellate court is\r\nbound by the circuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.

Â \r\n\nIf any evidence supports a jury charge, the circuit court should grant the request.\r\nState v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004). To warrant\r\nreversal, a circuit court's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\nerroneous and prejudicial to the defendant. Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nNiles argues the circuit court erred in failing to charge the jury on voluntary\r\nmanslaughter because conflicting testimony was presented to support a jury charge\r\non voluntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\nTo the contrary, the State asserts a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter was not\r\nappropriate in this case. The State argues only two scenarios are possible from the\r\nevidence presented at trial: (1) Salter shot first, and Niles acted in self-defense by\r\nreturning fire; or (2) Niles shot at Salter first, committing murder during the\r\ncommission of an armed robbery. The State contends that Niles failed to present\r\nevidence showing legal provocation or sudden heat of passion, which are both\r\nprerequisites to support a charge on voluntary manslaughter. We agree with Niles.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence presented at trial determines the law to be charged to the jury.\"\r\nState v. Hernandez, 386 S.C. 655, 660, 690 S.E.2d 582, 585 (Ct. App. 2010). \"To\r\nwarrant a court's eliminating the offense of [voluntary] manslaughter, it should\r\nvery clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the\r\ncrime from murder to [voluntary] manslaughter.\" State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101,\r\n525 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000) (emphasis added). In determining whether the\r\nevidence requires a charge of voluntary manslaughter, the circuit court views facts\r\nin a light most favorable to the defendant. State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474\r\nS.E.2d 430, 431 (1996).\r\n\r\n\"Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in [a] sudden\r\nheat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.\" State v. Wharton, 381 S.C.\r\n209, 214, 672 S.E.2d 786, 788 (2009). Both sufficient legal provocation and heat\r\nof passion must be present at the time of the killing to support a jury instruction on\r\nvoluntary manslaughter. Hernandez, 386 S.C. at 660, 690 S.E.2d at 585.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a court is permitted to charge a jury on both voluntary manslaughter\r\nand self-defense if supported by the evidence. In State v. Gilliam, 296 S.C. 395,\r\n396-97, 373 S.E.2d 596, 597 (1988), our supreme court held a jury charge on self-\r\ndefense and voluntary manslaughter are not mutually exclusive, stating:\r\n\n             Both self-defense and the lesser included offense of\r\n             voluntary manslaughter should be submitted to the jury if\r\n             supported by the evidence. The rationale for this rule is\r\n             that the jury may fail to find all the elements of self-\r\n             defense but could find sufficient legal provocation and\r\n             heat of passion to conclude the defendant was guilty of\r\n             voluntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n(internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\nHere, we find Niles' testimony that Salter fired the first shot at him, and he\r\nsubsequently returned fire provides sufficient evidence to support a jury charge on\r\nvoluntary manslaughter. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Niles,\r\nwe believe a jury could find Niles acted in a heat of passion upon sufficient legal\r\nprovocation, thus supporting a voluntary manslaughter jury charge.\r\n\r\n I.   Legal Provocation\r\n\r\nFirst, we find there is evidence, albeit conflicting, that Salter sufficiently provoked\r\nNiles.\r\n\r\nAn unprovoked attack with a deadly weapon or an overt threatening act can\r\nconstitute sufficient legal provocation to support a jury charge on voluntary\r\nmanslaughter. State v. Starnes, 388 S.C. 590, 597-98, 698 S.E.2d 604, 608 (2010).\r\nIn Gilliam, our supreme court found adequate legal provocation to support a jury\r\ncharge on voluntary manslaughter from the defendant's testimony that the victim\r\nmade threatening statements to the defendant, drew a gun, and shot at the\r\ndefendant. Gilliam, 296 S.C. at 396-97, 373 S.E.2d at 597. Further, in State v.\r\nLinder, 276 S.C. 304, 306-07, 278 S.E. 2d 335, 337 (1981), our supreme court held\r\nthe evidence supported a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter when, under the\r\ndefendant's version of the facts, a patrolman began shooting at the defendant before\r\nthe defendant reached for his weapon, returned fire, and killed the patrolman.\r\n\r\nHere, Niles testified:\r\n\r\n             [W]hen [Moore] was getting out of the car and Salter was\r\n             reaching underneath his seat I seen him pulling the gun\r\n             and that's when he start[ed] firing off as [Moore] was\r\n             jumping in the back seat and when he pulled the door to\r\n             that's when . . . [Salter] was shooting in the car. That's\r\n\n             when my fiancÃ© started screaming. [Hammond] ducked\r\n             in my lap. She was screaming. So, while [Salter] was\r\n             shooting in the car . . . I grabbed my pistol and that's\r\n             when I shot two times.\r\n\r\nWe find Niles' testimony provided evidence that he shot Salter after Salter pulled a\r\ngun and began shooting at Niles. Accordingly, viewing the evidence in a light\r\nmost favorable to Niles, we find his version of the facts provided sufficient legal\r\nprovocation to support a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. See State v.\r\nPittman, 373 S.C. 527, 573, 647 S.E.2d 144, 168 (2008) (\"This court has\r\npreviously held that an overt, threatening act or a physical encounter may\r\nconstitute sufficient legal provocation.\"); see also State v. Gadsden, 314 S.C. 229,\r\n233, 442 S.E.2d 594, 597 (1994) (\"In determining whether the evidence required a\r\ncharge of voluntary manslaughter, we view the facts in a light most favorable to\r\nthe defendant.\").\r\n\r\nII.   Heat of passion\r\n\r\nSecond, we find evidence was presented at trial to show Niles acted in a heat of\r\npassion when he shot Salter.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter, sudden heat of passion, while it\r\nneed not dethrone reason entirely, must be such that would \"naturally disturb the\r\nsway of reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool\r\nreflection, and produce what, according to human experience, may be called an\r\nuncontrollable impulse to do violence.\" State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 399, 434\r\nS.E.2d 272, 274 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"However,\r\neven when a person's passion is sufficiently aroused by a legally adequate\r\nprovocation, if at the time of the killing those passions had cooled or a sufficiently\r\nreasonable time had elapsed so that the passions of the ordinary person would have\r\ncooled, the killing would be murder and not manslaughter.\" Hernandez, 386 S.C.\r\nat 661, 690 S.E.2d at 585 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\n\"Whether an accused cooled off prior to a violent act must be determined by a\r\nreview of all the circumstances surrounding the event and the people involved.\"\r\nId.\r\n\r\nNiles testified that after Salter began shooting at his vehicle, Niles reached for his\r\ngun and returned fire. He stated:\r\n\n             So, while he was shooting in the car . . . I grabbed my\r\n             pistol and that's when I shot two times. My eyes were\r\n             closed. I wasn't even looking. I shot two times. I went\r\n             pow, pow. I wasn't trying to hit nobody . . . I was just\r\n             trying to get him to stop shooting. That's all I was trying\r\n             to do. I didn't know if my fiancÃ© got shot or nothing.\r\n             That's the first thing that came to my head, you know.\r\n\r\nFrom Niles' testimony, we find there is evidence Niles acted in a sudden heat of\r\npassion. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, there is no evidence Niles\r\nhad a period of time to cool down or reflect before reaching for his gun and firing\r\nback at Salter. See State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 307-09, 555 S.E.2d 391, 397-98\r\n(2001) (holding it is error to refuse a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter when\r\nin viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, there is no\r\nevidence that a significant period of time elapsed between the attack of the\r\ndefendant by the decedent and the defendant's fatal blows). Further, Niles'\r\ntestimony that grabbing the gun and returning fire was the \"the first thing that came\r\nto . . . [his] mind\" supports that he was acting on impulse upon being shot at by\r\nSalter. See Starnes, 388 S.C. at 598, 698 S.E.2d at 609 (holding to constitute\r\nsudden heat of passion to warrant a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter, a\r\ndefendant's fear immediately following an attack or threatening act must cause the\r\ndefendant to lose control and create an uncontrollable impulse to do violence).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Niles, we find\r\nevidence sufficient to support a charge on voluntary manslaughter; therefore, the\r\ncircuit court erred in failing to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter. See\r\nState v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999) (holding that if\r\nthere is any evidence to support a jury charge, the circuit court should grant the\r\nrequest).\r\n\r\nIII.   Prejudice\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the error of the circuit court in failing to charge the jury with\r\nvoluntary manslaughter prejudiced Niles. \"The [circuit] court commits reversible\r\nerror if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised by the evidence.\" State\r\nv. Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 173, 539 S.E.2d 71, 75 (Ct. App. 2000). However, even\r\nif the circuit court \"refuses to give a specific charge, there is no error if the charge\r\nactually given sufficiently covers the substance of the request.\" State v. Brandt,\r\n393 S.C. 526, 549, 713 S.E.2d 591, 603 (2011) (internal citation omitted). The\r\nparty complaining of the circuit court's refusal to give the requested instruction\r\n\nbears the burden of demonstrating prejudice to warrant a reversal. Otis Elevator,\r\nInc. v. Hardin Const. Co. Group, Inc., 316 S.C. 292, 299, 450 S.E.2d 41, 45\r\n(1994).\r\n\r\nWe find Niles met his burden of showing he was prejudiced by the circuit court's\r\nrefusal to give the requested jury instruction. Here, the circuit court failed to give\r\nany instruction on voluntary manslaughter. The jury charges the circuit court gave\r\nregarding self-defense, murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime do not cover the substance of voluntary\r\nmanslaughter, nor do they explain the elements of voluntary manslaughter. Based\r\non the evidence presented at trial, viewed in a light most favorable to the\r\ndefendant, a jury could have found Niles guilty of voluntary manslaughter. See\r\nHarrison, 343 S.C. at 175, 539 S.E.2d at 76 (holding defendant was prejudiced\r\nwhen based on the evidence at trial, a different verdict might have been reached if\r\nthe jury had been charged with the instruction requested by the defendant).\r\nTherefore, Niles was prejudiced by the circuit court's failure to instruct the jury on\r\nvoluntary manslaughter. See id., 343 S.C. at 173, 539 S.E.2d at 75 (\"To warrant\r\nreversal, a [circuit court's] refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both\r\nerroneous and prejudicial.\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the circuit court erred in refusing to charge the\r\njury on voluntary manslaughter, and thus, we REVERSE Niles' conviction for\r\nmurder and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's decision is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n      Â \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5046","title":"State v.

The State\r\nclaims the record contains no basis for the trial court's decision, and the trial court's\r\nfailure to exercise any discretion constituted an abuse of discretion. Alternatively,\r\n\nthe State claims the trial court erred in excluding the statement pursuant to a Rule\r\n403, SCRE analysis. Samuel cross-appeals the trial court's denial of her motion to\r\nsuppress her statements to law enforcement. She maintains the statements were\r\ntaken in violation of her Miranda1 rights because her pre-custodial Miranda\r\nwarning and waiver was not effective after custody was established. We affirm in\r\npart, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2008, Samuel babysat Jessica Davis's two-year-old son. Samuel took\r\nthe child to the park and returned home around 7 p.m., at which time she placed the\r\nchild in his crib. When Davis checked on her son at some time after 11 p.m., she\r\ndiscovered he was not breathing and had passed away.\r\n\r\nWhen Samuel and Davis gave their initial statements at the Columbia Police\r\nDepartment (CPD) on August 1, 2008, they were not considered suspects of a\r\ncrime. After further investigation, Investigators Kevin Reese and A.L. Thomas\r\nrequested additional statements from Samuel and Davis, and they voluntarily\r\nreturned to the CPD on August 6, 2008.\r\n\r\nSamuel was first interviewed by Investigator Joe Gray, who read Samuel her\r\nMiranda rights and had her sign an \"Advice of Rights\" form prior to conducting a\r\npolygraph examination. This occurred at approximately 10:30 a.m. Investigator\r\nGray indicated Samuel was free to leave at any time before, during, or after his\r\nexamination. Around 12:16 p.m., after conducting the polygraph examination,\r\nInvestigator Gray informed Samuel the results showed deception in some of her\r\nanswers. He then pulled his chair in front of Samuel, who was still seated and\r\nunrestrained in her chair, and continued to question her. These follow-up\r\nquestions were not part of the polygraph examination, but were done as a result of\r\nthe polygraph examination. She proceeded to give a statement of the events that\r\ntranspired on July 31 (Statement 1), in which she discussed injuries occurring to\r\nthe child, which was a change from the story she initially gave law enforcement.\r\nInvestigator Gray subsequently notified Investigators Reese and Thomas that\r\nSamuel had provided an additional statement and concluded his interview with\r\nSamuel at about 1 p.m.\r\n\r\nInvestigator Thomas testified that because there were indications Samuel had\r\nchanged her story, he and Agent Greg Shockley, who was with the South Carolina\r\n\r\n1   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\nLaw Enforcement Department's (SLED) Child Fatality Task Force, conducted an\r\ninterview with Samuel in a different room from where her polygraph examination\r\nand first interview were administered. He testified Samuel was free to leave and\r\nnot in custody, but he never explicitly told Samuel she was free to leave. He was\r\nalso aware she had previously been advised of her Miranda rights. A portion of\r\ntheir interview with Samuel was recorded on a digital recorder (Statement 2). The\r\ndigital recorder stopped recording due to memory shortage, so they continued\r\nmemorializing her answers by having her write the remainder of her statement.\r\nShe also answered some questions in her written statement (Statement 3). The\r\ninterview with Investigator Thomas and Agent Shockley was concluded around\r\n2:30 p.m. Investigator Thomas's opinion was that Samuel was free to leave until\r\napproximately 5:40 p.m., when he contended she was taken into custody.\r\n\r\nInvestigators Thomas and Reese conferred with each other following the second\r\ninterview, and after discussing the child autopsy results and information provided\r\nby Davis, they determined the evidence did not corroborate Samuel's story. They\r\nconcluded it was necessary to ask Samuel some additional questions. Samuel was\r\nasked if she needed a break to use the restroom or get some water or food. Further,\r\nInvestigator Reese asked Samuel if she had been advised of her rights and if she\r\nstill wished to speak with them. She confirmed that she had been advised of her\r\nrights and indicated she was willing to continue talking. Samuel gave another\r\ntaped statement (Statement 4), as well as handwritten answers to Investigator\r\nReese's follow-up questions (Statement 5). In her final statements, Samuel\r\nadmitted the child would not stop crying while in her care, so she picked him up\r\nand shook him until he stopped. After shaking him, the child was unresponsive.\r\nInstead of calling for help, Samuel left the house with the child and went to the\r\npark. She explained that her boyfriend picked them up from the park and brought\r\nthem home. Davis was at the home when Samuel returned, but Samuel did not\r\nalert anyone to the child's condition and placed him in the crib. Investigator Reese\r\ntestified Samuel had been free to leave and they could not have stopped her until\r\nher confession at some point between 3:58 p.m. and 5:17 p.m. This interview\r\nended at 5:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nOn November 29, 2010, a pre-trial, Jackson v. Denno2 hearing was held to\r\ndetermine whether Samuel's multiple statements to law enforcement were given\r\nknowingly and voluntarily. Samuel cited State v. Bradshaw, 457 S.E.2d 456 (W.\r\nVa. 1995), to support her argument that because she was not re-advised of her\r\nMiranda rights after custody was established, any statements made during\r\n\r\n2   378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\ncustodial interrogation were not voluntary or admissible in trial. Samuel conceded\r\nthat staleness of her waiver was not an issue under these facts. The trial court held\r\nthat by the preponderance of the evidence, Samuel was fully advised of her\r\nMiranda rights before any interrogation, and the constitutional safeguards were\r\nsufficiently met. Further, it found South Carolina case law supported the position\r\nthat statements given after a polygraph examination are voluntary and admissible\r\nunder certain circumstances, and in the present situation, the police were not\r\n\"excessive or overbearing.\" After determining that all of Samuel's statements were\r\ngiven knowingly and voluntarily, the trial court held they were admissible into\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nFollowing the trial court's Denno ruling, the State assured the trial court\r\nInvestigator Gray would not reference the polygraph in any manner, and he would\r\nonly testify about advising Samuel of her rights and her post-Miranda statements\r\nto him. At that point, Samuel interjected and stated she wanted to bring in the\r\npolygraph, but maintained she was not allowed to do so under case law.\r\nSpecifically, defense counsel said, \"We want to bring in the polygraph. . . . We\r\nwant the polygraph. We want to show that he says to her, 'You lie'. Now how can\r\nwe do that when the Supreme Court has prohibited the mention of the polygraph?\"\r\nShe then argued a Rule 403 analysis dictated Statement 1 should be excluded. She\r\ncontended that \"[Investigator Gray] can testify that he Mirandized her, but\r\nanything that comes after â€“ he says, 'I gave you a polygraph exam and you lie,\" at\r\nwhich time the trial court interrupted Samuel and agreed with her. It ruled that\r\nInvestigator Gray would only be allowed to testify that he advised Samuel of her\r\nMiranda rights at 10:30 a.m. and then \"turned her over to the other officers at\r\n1:30.\" The State immediately stopped the hearing and requested the opportunity to\r\nfile an appeal because Investigator Gray's testimony was \"crucial\" in explaining the\r\nthree-hour time period in which he interviewed Samuel.\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 2010, the State served a notice of appeal from the trial court's oral\r\norder,3 and Samuel served a cross-appeal on December 8, 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 See State v. McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, 168, 337 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1985) (\"A pre-\r\ntrial order granting the suppression of evidence which signficantly impairs the\r\nprosecution of a criminal case is directly appealable under S.C.

(citing Pagan, 369 S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d at 265).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State asserts the trial court correctly found Statement 1 was given knowingly\r\nand voluntarily but abused its discretion in subsequently suppressing it and only\r\nallowing Investigator Gray to testify he read Samuel her Miranda rights.\r\nSpecifically, the State maintains the trial court did not provide a legal or factual\r\nbasis for the statement's suppression, or alternatively, the trial court erred in\r\nexcluding the statement under Rule 403, SCRE. We agree the trial court erred in\r\nfinding Statement 1 should be suppressed based on the improper belief that\r\npolygraph evidence is per se inadmissible.\r\n\r\nAs a threshold matter, Samuel contends the State did not preserve its argument\r\nregarding the lack of a legal or factual basis for suppression of Statement 1. See\r\nState v. Porter, 389 S.C. 27, 37, 698 S.E.2d 237, 242 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"The\r\ngeneral rule of issue preservation is if an issue was not raised to and ruled upon by\r\nthe trial court, it will not be considered for the first time on appeal.\"); Queen's\r\nGrant II Horizontal Prop. Regime v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 372,\r\n628 S.E.2d 902, 919 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"Error preservation principles are intended\r\nto enable the trial court to rule after it has considered all relevant facts, law and\r\narguments.\" (citing Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498\r\n(Ct. App. 2004))). The record establishes the State's only argument was that the\r\nstatements made to Investigator Gray were \"crucial\" to the State's case, and thus, it\r\nwanted to appeal the decision immediately. This statement did not preserve the\r\nState's appellate argument regarding the trial court's lack of a legal or factual basis\r\nfor suppression. The State had the opportunity to request a more specific basis for\r\nthe trial court's ruling, thereby preserving the argument, but the State only said,\r\n\n\"based on your ruling, as I understand it that Investigator Gray would only be\r\nallowed to testify to the Miranda rights and none of the statement she made to him\r\nwould be admissible, we would respectfully choose to appeal that at this time.\"\r\nAccordingly, we find the State did not preserve this particular argument.\r\n\r\nWe now analyze whether the trial court erred in suppressing the statement pursuant\r\nto Rule 403, SCRE. Rule 403 provides that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be\r\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of\r\nundue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" The\r\nrecord does not contain a significant Rule 403 analysis. It consisted of the trial\r\ncourt agreeing with Samuel that Statement 1 is prejudicial because Samuel could\r\nnot present the polygraph to the jury, improperly preventing her from showing the\r\nfull circumstances surrounding the voluntariness of Statement 1. See State v.\r\nMiller, 375 S.C. 370, 379, 383, 652 S.E.2d 444, 451 (Ct. App. 2007) (\"Once the\r\ntrial judge determines [by the preponderance of the evidence] that the statement\r\n[was given voluntarily and] is admissible, it is up to the jury to ultimately\r\ndetermine, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether the statement was voluntarily\r\nmade.\"); see also State v. Pressley, 290 S.C. 251, 252, 349 S.E.2d 403, 404 (1986)\r\n(\"Evidence regarding the results of a polygraph test or the defendant's willingness\r\nor refusal to submit to one is inadmissible.\").\r\n\r\nWe find error in the trial court's reliance upon Samuel's assertion that polygraph\r\nevidence is per se inadmissible. Samuel cites Pressley on appeal in support of her\r\nargument that polygraph results are not admissible in trial, but we disagree with\r\nher reliance on that case. 290 S.C. at 252, 349 S.E.2d at 404.\r\n\r\nFollowing its decision in Pressley, our supreme court found in State v. Wright, 322\r\nS.C. 253, 256, 471 S.E.2d 700, 702 (1996),4 that a trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in admitting the post-polygraph confession into evidence while\r\nprohibiting the appellant from mentioning the polygraph. Although the appellant's\r\npolygraph results showed deception, he wanted to admit it to show the jury his\r\npost-polygraph confession was not voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at\r\n254-55, 471 S.E.2d at 701. While recognizing \"the authority against admitting\r\nevidence of polygraph examinations and the potential prejudice to appellant,\" the\r\n\r\n4This case was decided before our supreme court's decision in State v. Council,\r\n335 S.C. 1, 23-24, 515 S.E.2d 508, 519-20 (1999), which clarified further that\r\npolygraph evidence was not per se inadmissible, and outlined the analysis required\r\nwhen determining whether polygraph evidence can be admitted into trial.\r\n\ncourt indicated some flexibility to the general rule and stated the \"appellant did not\r\nsuggest at trial nor on appeal what limitation could have been placed on the\r\ndisclosure to limit prejudice to appellant.\" Id. at 256, 471 S.E.2d at 702. \"Without\r\nsome limitation, the only inference the jury could reasonably have drawn from\r\nlearning appellant's confession followed closely after a deceptive polygraph was\r\nthat the confession was truthful and the answers given to the polygraph exam were\r\nuntruthful.\" Id. That would have served \"to bolster [the appellant's] confession\r\nrather than persuade the jury to believe the alleged coercion.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAfter suggesting in Wright that polygraph evidence could potentially be admissible\r\nin trial, if sufficient safeguards were in place to limit the possible prejudice to the\r\ndefendant, our supreme court further explained in Council, 335 S.C. at 23-24, 515\r\nS.E.2d at 519-20, that \"the results of polygraph examinations are generally not\r\nadmissible because the reliability of the tests is questionable,\" but that \"in light of\r\nthe adoption of the SCRE, admissibility of [polygraph evidence] should be\r\nanalyzed under Rules 702 and 403, SCRE and the Jones factors.\" Upon review of\r\nthese cases, we find Samuel's statement that polygraph evidence is per se\r\ninadmissible is incorrect. The trial court could have conducted an analysis\r\npursuant to Council to determine what evidence, if any, regarding the polygraph\r\nexamination was admissible in the present case.\r\n\r\nBecause the trial court based its decision to suppress Statement 1 on the erroneous\r\nbelief that polygraph evidence was per se inadmissible, we reverse and remand this\r\nissue to the trial court in accordance with this decision.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL'S CROSS-APPEAL\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in determining Samuel's statements were voluntarily given\r\nwhen a law enforcement officer administered pre-custodial Miranda rights but\r\nfailed to re-advise Samuel of her Miranda rights after being taken into custody?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The trial judge determines the admissibility of a statement upon proof of its\r\nvoluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.\" State v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370,\r\n378, 652 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54,\r\n55, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988); State v. Smith, 268 S.C. 349, 353-54, 234 S.E.2d\r\n19, 21 (1977)). \"The jury must determine whether the statement was freely and\r\nvoluntarily given beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. (citing Washington, 296 S.C. at\r\n55-56, 370 S.E.2d at 612). \"On appeal, the conclusion of the trial judge as to the\r\n\nvoluntariness of a statement will not be reversed unless so erroneous as to show an\r\nabuse of discretion.\" Id. (citing State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243, 471\r\nS.E.2d 689, 695 (1996)). \"When reviewing a trial judge's ruling concerning\r\nvoluntariness, the appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own\r\nview of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial\r\njudge's ruling is supported by any evidence.\" Id. at 378-79, 652 S.E.2d at 448\r\n(citing State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551 S.E.2d 240, 252 (2001)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSamuel argues that a law enforcement officer's pre-custodial advisement of her\r\nMiranda rights was not sufficient for the subsequent custodial interrogation, and\r\nlaw enforcement should have re-advised her of them when she was taken into\r\ncustody. She maintains that because Miranda rights are only applicable during\r\ncustodial interrogation, the failure to administer them again once she was in\r\ncustody renders her statements inadmissible. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has not directly addressed the issue of whether a pre-custodial\r\nMiranda waiver is per se ineffective when applied to confessions made after\r\ncustody was established. However, several other states have addressed this issue,\r\nand all but one determined that instead of a bright-line approach to the issue, it is\r\nmore appropriate to apply a totality-of-the-circumstances assessment. See Upton v.\r\nState, 36 S.W.3d 740, 743 (Ark. 2001) (\"'When the police are conducting a good\r\nfaith [pre-custodial] investigation at police headquarters, they may have difficulty\r\nin determining the precise moment when questioning turns into custodial\r\ninterrogation and Miranda warnings are required. Although the uncertain line\r\nbetween questioning and custodial interrogation does not excuse late warnings, it\r\ndoes provide a justification for the validity of good faith early warnings[,] which\r\nare sufficiently proximate to formal custody to alert the person being questioned to\r\nthe importance of these constitutional rights.'\" (quoting State v. Burge, 487 A.2d\r\n532, 543 (Conn. 1985))); State v. Dispoto, 913 A.2d 791, 800-01 (N.J. 2007)\r\n(stating that instead of finding that pre-custodial Miranda waivers are per se\r\nineffective, a totality-of-the-circumstances approach \"is preferable in that it\r\nencourages warnings when police question a suspect and allows law enforcement\r\nofficials to pursue their investigations, subject to later review by a neutral court\");\r\nState v. Grady, 766 N.W.2d 729, 734-36 (Wis. 2009) (finding that \"a sound\r\ninterpretation of Miranda and sound public policy require the application of the\r\n[totality-of-the-circumstances test rather than a bright-line rule\"); but see State v.\r\nBradshaw, 457 S.E.2d 456, 466-67 (W.Va. 1995) (finding a defendant cannot\r\nanticipatorily invoke his Miranda rights, because the \"window of opportunity\" for\r\n\nthe assertion of Miranda rights comes into existence only when that right is\r\navailable during a custodial interrogation; however, to avoid a significant burden\r\non the defendant, when police have given Miranda rights outside the context of\r\ncustodial interrogation, those warnings must be repeated once custodial\r\ninterrogation begins).\r\n\r\nThe majority view is convincing, and we find pre-custodial Miranda warnings and\r\nwaivers may be sufficiently effective during a subsequent custodial interrogation\r\nwithout the need for re-advisement, but a totality-of-the-circumstances assessment\r\nshould be applied to each case. In the present case, evidence in the record supports\r\nthe trial court's finding that Samuel's statements were voluntary and admissible at\r\ntrial.5 For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we reverse the trial court's exclusion of Statement 1 based upon its\r\ninaccurate assessment that polygraph evidence is per se inadmissible.\r\nAdditionally, we affirm the trial court's ruling that Samuel's statements to law\r\nenforcement were voluntary and admissible pursuant to Jackson v. Denno.\r\nFinally, we remand this case in accordance with this opinion.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Samuel conceded to the trial court that staleness was not an issue under these\r\nfacts, and the sole argument on appeal is that pre-custodial Miranda rights and\r\nwaivers are not effective once custody is subsequently established. We also note\r\nSamuel was asked whether she had been given her rights, to which she responded\r\naffirmatively and indicated she was willing to continue with the interview.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5048","title":"State v.

We vacate Bonner's sentence and\r\nremand for resentencing.\r\n\n                                      FACTS\n\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 2008, Dipali Darji was the victim of a home-invasion robbery. The\r\npolice later arrested Bonner and seven other individuals for committing the\r\nburglary. At the time of the offense, Bonner was seventeen years old.1\r\n\r\nBonner was indicted on charges of burglary in the first degree, grand larceny,\r\nburglary in the second degree, kidnapping, armed robbery, and assault and battery\r\nof a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN). On November 17, 2009, the jury\r\nreturned a verdict of guilty on all charges. Before sentencing, the trial judge asked\r\nto hear from Bonner's defense counsel. Counsel asked the court to take into\r\nconsideration Bonner's \"relative age and youth.\" However, counsel mistakenly\r\nstated Bonner was nineteen years old.2\r\n\r\nThe trial court sentenced Bonner to life in prison without parole (LWOP) for the\r\nburglary in the first degree charge.3 Bonner's counsel did not object to the\r\nsentence, nor did he raise any issue concerning the sentence in a post-trial motion.\r\nBonner appeals his sentence of LWOP for burglary in the first degree.4\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. We are\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\" State\r\nv. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that issues not raised and ruled on in the trial court will not be\r\nconsidered on appeal. State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94\r\n(2003); State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 583, 611 S.E.2d 273, 281 (Ct. App.\r\n\r\n1 It is undisputed that Bonner was seventeen years old at the time of the offense. \n\r\nThe sentencing sheet indicates Bonner was born on January 24, 1991.\n\r\n2 At the time of trial, Bonner was eighteen years old. \n\r\n3 A charge of burglary in the first degree carries a sentence between fifteen years to\n\r\nlife imprisonment. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(B) (2003). Bonner was sentenced \n\r\nas follows: LWOP for burglary in the first degree; five years for grand larceny; \n\r\nfifteen years for burglary in the second degree; thirty years for kidnapping; thirty\n\r\nyears for armed robbery; and ten years for ABHAN. All the sentences were \n\r\nimposed concurrently to each other, with the exception of the sentence for \n\r\nABHAN. \n\r\n4 Bonner does not challenge his conviction or sentence for any other charge. \n\r\n\n2005). Thus, \"a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial, or the issue will not\r\nbe preserved for appellate review.\" State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510\r\nS.E.2d 423, 425 (1999). Nevertheless, an exception to the general rule of issue\r\npreservation exists authorizing the appellate court to consider an unpreserved issue\r\nin the interest of judicial economy under appropriate circumstances. See State v.\r\nVick, 384 S.C. 189, 203, 682 S.E.2d 275, 282 (Ct. App. 2009) (vacating a\r\nkidnapping sentence in the interest of judicial economy, even though the issue was\r\nnot preserved for review); see also Jeter v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 369 S.C. 433,\r\n441 n.6, 633 S.E.2d 143, 147 n.6 (2006) (holding the appellate court would address\r\nan issue in the interest of judicial economy despite any preservation problems).\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBonner argues his sentence of LWOP for burglary in the first degree should be\r\nvacated. He contends the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S.\r\nConstitution, as interpreted in Graham v. Florida, __ U.S. __, 130 S. Ct. 2011\r\n(2010), forbid the imposition of a LWOP sentence for a non-homicide crime\r\ncommitted by a juvenile. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment 'guarantees\r\nindividuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.'\" Miller v.\r\nAlabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 2458 (2012) (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551,\r\n560 (2005)). In Graham, the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth\r\nAmendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause \"prohibits the imposition of a\r\nlife without parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide.\"\r\n130 S. Ct. at 2034. The Court explained: \"A State is not required to guarantee\r\neventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime. What\r\nthe State must do, however, is give [these offenders] some meaningful opportunity\r\nto obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\" 130 S. Ct. at\r\n2030.\r\n\r\nHere, it is undisputed that Bonner was seventeen years old at the time of the\r\noffense. The State concedes in its brief that it was error for the trial court to\r\nsentence Bonner to LWOP for burglary in the first degree. However, the State\r\ncontends the sentencing issue is not preserved for appellate review because Bonner\r\nnever objected to the sentence imposed for burglary in the first degree, nor did he\r\nraise any issue with the sentence in a post-trial motion. The State further argues\r\nthe most appropriate avenue for addressing Bonner's claim is a post-conviction\r\nrelief (PCR) proceeding.\r\n\nBonner acknowledges the sentencing issue is not preserved for appellate review.5\r\nHowever, he asserts that the court should address the sentencing issue in the\r\ninterest of judicial economy. We agree.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Johnston, the South Carolina Supreme Court established the appellate\r\ncourt's authority in \"exceptional circumstances\" to consider an improper sentence\r\neven though the sentencing issue was not properly preserved. 333 S.C. 459, 464,\r\n510 S.E.2d 423, 425. The Johnston court identified two exceptional circumstances\r\nwarranting consideration of an appellant's improper sentence for the first time on\r\nappeal. Id. at 463-64, 510 S.E.2d at 425; see also, Jean Hoefer Toal, Shahin Vafai,\r\nRobert A. Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina 61 (2nd ed. 2002).\r\nFirst, there is an exceptional circumstance when \"the State has conceded in its\r\nbriefs and oral argument that the trial court committed error by imposing an\r\nexcessive sentence.\" Id. at 463, 510 S.E.2d at 425. Second, an exceptional\r\ncircumstance exists when there is a \"real threat that Defendant will remain\r\nincarcerated beyond the legal sentence due to the additional time it will take to\r\npursue [PCR].\" Id. at 464, 510 S.E.2d at 425. Based on these exceptional\r\ncircumstances, the Johnston court reached the merits of the appellant's case and\r\nremanded the case for resentencing. Id.\r\n\r\nThis court addressed a similar situation in State v. Vick, 384 S.C. 189, 682 S.E.2d\r\n275 (Ct. App. 2009). There, the defendant appealed a thirty-year sentence for\r\nkidnapping in a case in which he was also convicted of murdering the victim. Id.\r\nat 201, 682 S.E.2d at 281. The State conceded Vick's sentence for kidnapping was\r\nimproper pursuant to section 16-3-910 of the South Carolina Code (2003), which\r\nprovides that one convicted of murder should not also be sentenced for kidnapping.\r\nId. The State nevertheless argued the sentencing issue was not properly preserved\r\nfor appellate review and that PCR was the appropriate avenue of relief. Id.\r\nHowever, the court considered the sentencing issue, irrespective of the\r\npreservation rule, because it was in the interest of judicial economy. Id. at 203,\r\n682 S.E.2d at 282. Accordingly, the court vacated Vick's kidnapping sentence. Id.\r\n\r\n5 The general rule of issue preservation provides that if an issue was not raised and\r\nruled upon below, it will not be considered for the first time on appeal. State v.\r\nDunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003). Even in the context of\r\njuvenile criminal matters, South Carolina courts have applied the general error\r\npreservation rule. See In re Antonio H., 324 S.C. 120, 122, 477 S.E.2d 713, 714\r\n(1996); In re Jamal G., 396 S.C. 158, 163-64, 720 S.E.2d 62, 64-65 (Ct. App.\r\n2011); In re Walter M., 386 S.C. 387, 392-93, 688 S.E.2d 133, 136 (Ct. App.\r\n2009).\r\n\nIn its opinion, the Vick court recognized, \"our courts have at times considered an\r\nissue in the interest of judicial economy.\" Id. at 202, 682 S.E.2d at 282. The court\r\ncited Jeter v. South Carolina Department of Transportation, 369 S.C. at 441 n.6,\r\n633 S.E.2d at 147 n.6, which addressed an issue in the interest of judicial economy\r\n\"[r]egardless of any preservation problems[.]\" Vick, 384 S.C. at 203, 682 S.E.2d at\r\n282. Additionally, the Vick court referenced Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph\r\nCo. v. Hamm, 306 S.C. 70, 75, 409 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1991), which considered a\r\nmatter in the interest of judicial economy when the issue would be raised to the\r\ncourt at some future time and both parties had fully briefed the issue. Vick, 384\r\nS.C. at 202, 682 S.E.2d at 282.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Vick court emphasized the State's concession that the kidnapping\r\nsentence was erroneously imposed as a controlling factor in its decision to address\r\nthe issue in the interest of judicial economy. Id. at 203, 682 S.E.2d at 282.\r\nSpecifically, the court noted that the State's concession presented an \"exceptional\r\ncircumstance\" pursuant to the standard established in State v. Johnston. Id. Even\r\nthough the court recognized Vick's case presented only one exceptional\r\ncircumstance because there was no threat Vick would be incarcerated beyond the\r\nlegal sentence, it nevertheless referenced that exceptional circumstance as the\r\ndeterminative factor in its decision to address the sentencing issue in the interest of\r\njudicial economy.

(Railroad), seeking an\r\norder establishing an easement across a right-of-way held by Railroad. Landowner\r\nand Railroad filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the circuit court\r\ngranted summary judgment to Railroad. Landowner seeks review of this order.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\n                       FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 1995, Richard R. Gayle, a member of Landowner, purchased from\r\nWayne King a fifteen-acre tract of land in McCormick County adjacent to the\r\nSavannah River (the Property).1 On the same date, Gayle conveyed a one-half\r\ninterest in the Property to Travers W. Paine, III, Landowner's other member. On\r\nJanuary 1, 2003, Paine and Gayle individually conveyed the Property to\r\nLandowner.\r\n\r\nThe Property is bounded on the north and east by a two-hundred-foot right-of-way\r\nheld by Railroad, which extends south to the river bank. Pollard Lumber Company\r\n(Pollard) owns the land to the immediate north and east of Railroad's right-of-way.\r\nThe record is unclear as to who owns fee simple title to the land underlying\r\nRailroad's right-of-way,2 although it is clear from the legal descriptions of their\r\nrespective properties that neither Landowner nor Pollard owns title to the\r\nunderlying land.\r\n\r\nThe Property can be accessed by watercraft via the Savannah River. However, the\r\nonly motor vehicle access for the Property is a gravel roadway that runs beneath\r\nRailroad's trestle (the access road). Pollard granted an easement to Landowner\r\nacross the southwesterly part of its land, which runs adjacent to Railroad's right-of-\r\nway, for the purpose of constructing an improved right-of-way for ingress and\r\negress; the access road running beneath the trestle picks up where the easement\r\ngranted by Pollard terminates.\r\n\r\nRailroad uses the access road whenever repair work on the trestle is necessary.\r\nThe distance from the bottom of the trestle to the underlying access road is twelve\r\nfeet, two inches at the highest point. The width of the useable part of the access\r\nroad is eleven feet, two inches, at its widest point.\r\n\r\nSince purchasing the Property, Paine and Gayle have used the access road to visit\r\nthe Property, to harvest timber from the Property, and to build a cabin on the\r\nProperty. In 2001, Paine paid South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G)\r\n$5,147 to obtain a utility easement from Railroad for the purpose of running\r\nelectrical lines through Railroad's right-of-way to the cabin on the Property. This\r\n\r\n\r\n1To be exact, the Property measures 15.16 acres. \n\r\n2The extent of Railroad's rights as to the underlying land is discussed in the \n\r\nanalysis section of this opinion.\n\r\n\namount included $2,872 to be paid to Railroad for the easement and $2,275 for\r\nSCE&G to install the service lines under Railroad's tracks.\r\n\r\nLandowner also obtained permission from Railroad's security officer, Steve Purvis,\r\nto build a gate across the access road to keep out trespassers. Purvis acknowledged\r\nthat the gate helped Railroad guard against potential liability for trespasser injuries.\r\nLandowner and Railroad possessed keys to the locks on the gate.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Paine and Gayle appeared before the McCormick County Planning\r\nCommission (the Commission) to present Landowner's plans for a small\r\nsubdivision on the Property. In his deposition, Paine testified that Landowner had\r\npaid its engineers approximately $35,000 for the plans and drawings. The\r\nCommission indicated that Landowner would have to obtain a written easement\r\nfrom Railroad to cross its right-of-way in order to run a water line into the\r\nsubdivision. Landowner's efforts to speak with a Railroad employee with authority\r\nto grant the easement were unsuccessful. Subsequently, Landowner filed the\r\npresent action, seeking an order recognizing its alleged right to cross Railroad's\r\nright-of-way to access the Property.3\r\n\r\nIn its amended complaint, Landowner asserted the following causes of action:\r\n\"Easement by Grant,\" \"Easement by Implication,\" \"Easement by Prescription,\"\r\n\"Easement by Necessity,\" \"Adverse Possession,\" \"Equitable Estoppel,\" \"Laches,\"\r\nand \"General Law of Easements.\" Landowner and Railroad filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment, and the circuit court granted summary judgment to Railroad,\r\nwhile denying Landowner's summary judgment motion.\r\n\r\nIn its order granting summary judgment to Railroad, the circuit court recognized\r\nthat the ownership of the strip of land underlying Railroad's right-of-way was\r\nunclear. The circuit court, however, concluded that Landowner did not own the\r\nfee underlying Railroad's right-of-way.4 The circuit court further indicated that\r\ndue to Landowner's failure to establish at least one essential element of each of its\r\ncauses of action, Railroad was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Landowner filed this action because it could not locate a person with authority to\r\ngrant a written easement. Paine admitted: \"We are here because . . . we can't get\r\nthe attention of the railroad to discuss an easement.\" Paine also admitted: \"We\r\ndon't know who to talk to.\"\r\n4 Landowner has not appealed this conclusion.\r\n\n                                  ISSUES ON APPEAL \n\r\n\r\n1. \t   Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Railroad on the\r\n       issue of easement by equitable estoppel?\r\n\r\n2. \t   Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Railroad on the\r\n       prescriptive easement claim?\r\n\r\n3. \t   Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Railroad on the\r\n       issue of laches?\r\n\r\n4. \t   Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Railroad on the\r\n       issue of easement by necessity?\r\n\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same\r\nstandard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Jackson v.\r\nBermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C. 11, 14 n.2, 677 S.E.2d 612, 614 n.2 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides that summary judgment shall be granted\r\nwhen \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\" \"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases\r\nnot requiring the services of a fact finder.\" Matsell v. Crowfield Plantation Cmty.\r\nServs. Ass'n, Inc., 393 S.C. 65, 70, 710 S.E.2d 90, 93 (Ct. App. 2011) (citing\r\nGeorge v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001)).\r\n\r\nAn adverse party may not rely on the mere allegations in his pleadings to withstand\r\na summary judgment motion, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a\r\ngenuine issue for trial. Strickland v. Madden, 323 S.C. 63, 68, 448 S.E.2d 581, 584\r\n(Ct. App. 1994). Nonetheless, \"in cases applying the preponderance of the\r\nevidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere\r\nscintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\"\r\nHancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).\r\n\n                                      LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Railroad Rights-of-Way\r\n\r\nTo foster a complete understanding of the parties' respective rights, we begin our\r\nanalysis of the issues in this case by explaining the nature of railroad rights-of-\r\nway. Ultimately, however, the precise nature of the estate held by Railroad in the\r\nstrip of land underlying its right-of-way does not affect our analysis of\r\nLandowner's easement claims.\r\n\r\n\"The term 'right-of-way,' as used in deeds, has dual meanings: it is sometimes used\r\nto describe the right belonging to a party allowing passage over any tract and is\r\nalso used to describe that strip of land that railroad companies take upon which to\r\nconstruct their road-bed.\" 65 Am. Jur. 2d Railroads Â§ 31 (2012). Likewise, the\r\nterm can have two purposes: (1) to qualify or limit the interest granted in a deed to\r\nthe right to pass over a tract of land, i.e., an easement; or (2) to describe the strip of\r\nland being conveyed to a railroad for the purpose of building a railway. Id. A\r\nrailroad can acquire real property for railway operations only pursuant to a statute,\r\nand \"when so authorized, a railroad may acquire an interest in real property by\r\neminent domain, by purchase, or by voluntary grant.\" Id. at Â§ 33.\r\n\r\nA railroad right-of-way allows a railroad company \"the free and perfect use of the\r\nsurface of the land as far as is necessary for all its purposes, and the right to use as\r\nmuch above and below its surface as may be needed.\" Id. at Â§ 66 (emphasis\r\nadded). A railroad right-of-way has been described as \"an easement with the\r\nsubstantiality of a fee and the attributes of a fee, perpetuity, and exclusive use and\r\npossession . . . .\" Id. at Â§ 62.\r\n\r\nHere, the statute chartering Railroad's predecessor in interest, the Greenwood and\r\nAugusta Railroad Company, states that the Company \"shall have the same\r\npresumptive right and title, and to the same extent, to lands through which their\r\nrailroad may be built, in absence of any agreement with the proprietor . . . of\r\nsuch lands, which is possessed or enjoyed by any other railroad, in [South\r\nCarolina and Georgia], as to the lands through which their railroad may have been,\r\nor may be, constructed, in absence of any contract with the owners thereof.\" Act\r\nNo. 170, Â§ 7, 1872 S.C. Acts 216, 219 (emphasis added). The \"presumptive right\r\nand title\" possessed by other railroads in South Carolina and Georgia when the\r\nGreenwood and Augusta Railroad Company was chartered is set forth in section 7\r\nof 1868 Act No. 42, which provides that upon payment of compensation to the\r\nlandowner, a right-of-way over the subject land,\r\n\n             or the use of said lands for the purposes for which the\r\n             same were required, shall vest in the person or\r\n             corporation who shall hold the charter of such highway,\r\n             so long as the same shall be used for such highway, and\r\n             no longer; but the fee in such lands subject to such\r\n             special uses shall remain in the owner thereof, and\r\n             nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer\r\n             upon such person or corporation any right in, or\r\n             power over, the lands so condemned, other than such\r\n             as may be within the particular purpose for which\r\n             such lands were condemned.\r\n\r\nAct No. 42, Â§ 7, 1868 S.C. Acts 88, 90 (emphasis added). In other words, in the\r\nabsence of an agreement by the owner to grant to the Greenwood and Augusta\r\nRailroad Company a fee simple estate in the land underlying its right-of-way, the\r\ncompany held merely a right-of-way easement. As recognized by the circuit court,\r\nthe parties presented inconclusive evidence concerning the estate granted to the\r\nGreenwood and Augusta Railroad Company. The circuit court, however,\r\nconcluded that Landowner did not own the fee underlying the railroad right-of-\r\nway, and Landowner has not appealed this conclusion. Therefore, this conclusion\r\nis the law of the case. See Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455, 458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153\r\n(2009) (\"Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, a party is precluded from relitigating,\r\nafter an appeal, matters that were either not raised on appeal, but should have been,\r\nor raised on appeal, but expressly rejected by the appellate court.\").\r\n\r\nIn any event, no person may interfere with a railroad's use of its right-of-way for\r\nrailroad purposes, and the railroad may prohibit even the owner of the underlying\r\nfee from interfering with such a use. See Faulkenberry v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 349\r\nS.C. 318, 325, 563 S.E.2d 644, 648 (2002) (noting that although the owner of the\r\nfee underlying a railroad right-of-way may cross the railroad tracks, he may not do\r\nanything that would unreasonably interfere with the railroad's use of its easement);\r\nMiller v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 94 S.C. 105, 108, 77 S.E. 748, 749 (1913)\r\n(holding that the owner of the fee underlying a railroad's right-of-way had the right\r\n\"to cross the railroad on his own land wherever he saw fit to do so,\" as long as he\r\ndid not interfere with the right of the railroad to use its right-of-way for railroad\r\npurposes).5\r\n\r\n5See also Atlanta & Charlotte Air-Line Ry. Co. v. Limestone-Globe Land Co., 109\r\nS.C. 444, 451, 96 S.E. 188, 190 (1918) (\"[T]he owner of the fee in a railroad right\r\n\n\"Railroad purposes\" include any purpose that \"furthers the business of the\r\nrailroad.\" Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 300 S.C. 369, 374, 388 S.E.2d 247, 250\r\n(Ct. App. 1989) (citing Sparrow v. Dixie Leaf Tobacco Co., 61 S.E.2d 700 (N.C.\r\n1950). \"The use . . . must be reasonably necessary for or convenient to the\r\noperation of the railroad.\" Sparrow, 61 S.E.2d at 703. Further, a railroad cannot\r\ndispose of its right-of-way or use it in a way that will destroy or impair its ability to\r\nserve the public. Eldridge, 300 S.C. at 375, 388 S.E.2d at 250 (citation and\r\nquotation marks omitted); see also Cayce Land Co. v. Guignard, 135 S.C. 446,\r\n550, 134 S.E. 1, 34 (1926) (holding that a railroad exceeded its authority as to its\r\nright-of-way by allowing a non-connecting spur track of a second railroad to pass\r\nunder the first railroad's tracks).\r\n\r\nThe railroad's use of its right-of-way may include the area underneath a trestle,\r\nwhich sits above the land on which the right-of-way is located. See N.Y., New\r\nHaven & Hartford R.R. Co. v. Armstrong, 102 A. 791, 796 (Conn. 1918) (holding\r\nthat an adjoining landowner had no right to run oil pipes through a railroad's right-\r\nof-way directly underneath its trestle, which was located above the surface of the\r\nland on which the railroad held its right-of-way); id. at 795 (holding that whatever\r\nspace was reasonably required for the purposes of support and security of a piling\r\nfor a platform on the southeasterly side of the railroad's tracks \"must be presumed\r\nto have been included as a part of the occupation of the trestle\"); id. (\"No narrow\r\nrule should be adopted in passing upon the [railroad's] acceptance of a public grant,\r\nwhere the welfare of the public is involved.\").\r\n\r\nII. Easement by Equitable Estoppel\r\n\r\nLandowner asserts the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nRailroad on the issue of easement by equitable estoppel. We disagree.\r\n\r\nTo establish a claim for easement by equitable estoppel, the party claiming\r\nestoppel must show the following elements as to the party sought to be estopped:\r\n\r\nof way has the right to use so much thereof as is not in the actual use and\r\noccupancy of the railroad company, provided the use be not inconsistent with the\r\nclaim of right of way for the railroad purposes.\"); 65 Am. Jur. 2d Railroads Â§ 62\r\n(2012) (\"A railroad company has the exclusive use of the surface of the land on\r\nwhich its right-of-way is located.\"); id. at Â§ 63 (\"The owner of the servient estate\r\nmay use the land in a manner and for any purpose that does not interfere with the\r\nfull and free use of the railroad easement.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\n(1) conduct that amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts,\r\nor, at least, that is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise\r\nthan, and inconsistent with, those that the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2)\r\nintention, or at least expectation, that such conduct shall be acted on by the other\r\nparty; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts. Boyd v.\r\nBellsouth Tel. & Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410, 422, 633 S.E.2d 136, 142 (2006). These\r\nelements may be satisfied by the silence of the party to be estopped when that party\r\nhas actual knowledge of the other party's prejudicial change in position. See\r\nO'Cain v. O'Cain, 322 S.C. 551, 557-59, 473 S.E.2d 460, 464-65 (Ct. App. 1996)\r\n(holding that a landowner was equitably estopped from denying the use of a\r\ndriveway on his property by an adjoining landowner when the first landowner\r\nremained silent during the second landowner's construction of the driveway and\r\nimprovements to land to which the driveway led). As to the party claiming\r\nestoppel, the following elements must be shown: (1) lack of knowledge and of the\r\nmeans of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) reliance on the\r\nconduct of the party sought to be estopped; and (3) a prejudicial change in position.\r\nId.\r\n\r\nHere, when questioned about McCormick County's requirement for Landowner to\r\nobtain a written easement from Railroad, Paine stated the following: \"Yes. And,\r\nin the meantime, we are out [of $30,000] or [$40,000] in engineering costs waiting\r\nto hear from [Railroad], who we cannot contact.\" Landowner argues: \"By failing\r\nto communicate, the railroad has necessitated needless expense, delay, and\r\nfrustration on our part.\" Landowner also argues Railroad misled it by \"laying low\r\nand not saying anythingâ€”having any objection to our subdivision development\r\nuntil we ask for something and then no one will respond. We spent approximately\r\n$35,000.00 in engineering drawings and planning . . . .\" Landowner states that\r\nRailroad also misled it by sharing a gate with Landowner and by granting the\r\nutility easement through its right-of-way:\r\n\r\n             [Railroad] sat by, allowed [Landowner] to spend large\r\n             sums of money, had no objection to the construction of a\r\n             cabin and electricity being provided to the cabin\r\n             underneath its tracks, and then when [Landowner]\r\n             requested legal acknowledgement of its access rightsâ€”\r\n             [Railroad] objected and acted in an entirely inconsistent\r\n             manner.\r\n\r\nLandowner asserts that its prejudicial change in position was \"cutting timber,\r\nconstructing a cabin, having power run, building a septic tank and on and on.\"\r\n\nHowever, Gayle admitted that Railroad never did anything or communicated\r\nanything to cause him to act in a way that would be detrimental to himself or to\r\nLandowner. Further, Gayle admitted that Railroad never made any false\r\nrepresentations to him, and Paine admitted that Railroad did not induce him to do\r\nanything with regard to the Property. As to Landowner's expenses in building the\r\ncabin and installing a gate across the access road, even if Railroad had been on\r\nnotice of Landowner's construction of the cabin, Paine and Gayle have continued\r\nto use the cabin for their personal enjoyment. Railroad has never denied\r\npermission, i.e., a mere license,6 to Paine and Gayle to cross the right-of-way for\r\nthese purposes. The record shows that Railroad had not taken any action adverse\r\nto Landowner's use of the road before Landowner filed this action.\r\n\r\nEven after this action was filed, Railroad continued to allow Paine and Gayle to\r\ncross the right-of-way for their personal enjoyment of the Property through late\r\nMarch 2009. In his deposition, Gayle testified that just a few days before the\r\ndeposition, which occurred on April 1, 2009, he was still able to cross the right-of-\r\nway. Further, Landowner indicated at oral argument that Railroad had not\r\ninterfered with Landowner's current use of the right-of-way thus far. Because\r\nPaine and Gayle may still use the cabin for their personal enjoyment, incurring\r\nexpenses to build the cabin, supply utilities to it, and install a gate did not amount\r\nto a prejudicial change in Landowner's position.\r\n\r\nAs to any expenses incurred for subdivision plans, nothing in the record shows\r\nthat, prior to Landowner's filing of this action, Railroad was aware of either (1)\r\nLandowner's future plans to use the access road as a residential subdivision\r\nentrance, or (2) Landowner's agreement to pay an engineering firm $30,000 to\r\n$40,000 for development plans and sketches.7 Although Paine's affidavit states\r\nthat Railroad \"specifically agreed\" to SCE&G's utility easement for the cabin \"and\r\n\r\n6 See Main v. Thomason, 342 S.C. 79, 92 n.5, 535 S.E.2d 918, 924 n.5 (2000),\r\noverruled on other grounds, Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 659, 620\r\nS.E.2d 76, 81 (2005) (defining a license as \"a personal, revocable, and\r\nunassignable privilege, conferred either by writing or parole, to do one or more\r\nacts on land without possessing any interest therein\") (quoting Briarcliffe Acres v.\r\nBriarcliffe Realty Co., 262 S.C. 599, 615, 206 S.E.2d 886, 894-95 (1974)).\r\n7 Landowner cites the communications between its engineers and Railroad\r\nregarding permission to build a driveway under the trestle, which took place prior\r\nto Gayle's purchase of the Property. However, the documentation of these\r\ncommunications does not indicate any plans to develop a subdivision on the\r\nProperty.\r\n\nfuture development[,]\" when pressed to attest to Railroad's awareness of\r\nLandowner's subdivision plans, Paine could not do so:\r\n\r\n             Q. But you can't say they knew you were going to build\r\n             a subdivision, can you?\r\n\r\n             A. Well, you might say we - - we relied on what we\r\n             knew.\r\n\r\nFurther, Railroad's awareness of Landowner's building of the cabin and running\r\nelectricity to it does not equate to an awareness of plans for a subdivision. Paine\r\ntestified that Railroad's agreement to allow SCE&G to run electrical lines through\r\nits right-of-way to the Property \"was on the presumption and the assumption that\r\n12 residential lots would be built.\" However, he later admitted that he did not\r\nknow what SCE&G communicated to Railroad when it obtained the utility\r\neasement. Nothing in the documents SCE&G submitted to Railroad for this\r\npurpose indicates that the electrical lines were to serve a residential subdivision\r\nwith multiple homes. Likewise, nothing in the record indicates that a\r\nrepresentative of Landowner communicated directly with Railroad regarding the\r\nutility easement. Paine admitted that Railroad had no knowledge that Landowner\r\nwas accumulating engineering expenses while \"waiting to hear\" from Railroad.\r\n\r\nMoreover, giving permission to one or two owners of the Property to cross the\r\nright-of-way hardly translates into consent for the access road to be used as a\r\nsubdivision entrance. First, Railroad finds it necessary from time to time to block\r\nthe access road so that its employees may perform repair work on the trestle, and\r\nRailroad asserts that Landowner's proposed development activities would interfere\r\nwith this work. Second, Railroad argues the proposed development activities\r\nthreaten the safety of its operations due to the limited clearance preventing safe\r\npassage of large vehicles, such as moving vans, cement trucks, and fire trucks.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing circumstances, mere silence on the part of Railroad does\r\nnot satisfy the elements required for equitable estoppel. See Boyd, 369 S.C. at 422,\r\n633 S.E.2d at 142 (requiring (1) misleading conduct; (2) the misleading party's\r\nintent that the other party rely on the conduct; and (3) the misleading party's\r\nknowledge of the real facts); cf. O'Cain, 322 S.C. at 558, 473 S.E.2d at 464 (stating\r\nthat the party to be estopped took action to deny an adjacent landowner's family\r\naccess over a driveway only after he thought they were going to require removal of\r\nhis hogs from their land). Therefore, the circuit court properly granted summary\r\njudgment to Railroad on Landowner's easement by estoppel claim.\r\n\nIII. Prescriptive Easement\r\n\r\nLandowner maintains that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nRailroad on Landowner's prescriptive easement claim. Landowner assigns error to\r\nthe circuit court's failure to consider the use of Railroad's right-of-way by\r\nLandowner's predecessors in title. We agree that the circuit court's analysis did not\r\naddress the use of the right-of-way by previous owners of the Property. However,\r\nLandowner failed to present evidence creating a genuine factual issue as to\r\nwhether the use of the right-of-way was \"adverse\" or under a \"claim of right,\" as\r\nexplained below, for the requisite twenty years. Therefore, we affirm summary\r\njudgment in favor of Railroad on this claim. See Rule 220(c), SCACR (stating that\r\nthe appellate court may affirm an order on any ground appearing in the Record on\r\nAppeal).\r\n\r\nA. Legal Elements\r\n\r\nTo establish an easement by prescription, a party must show the following: (1) the\r\ncontinued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of a right for a full period of twenty\r\nyears; (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed; and (3) that the use or enjoyment was\r\nadverse or under a claim of right. Jones v. Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 316, 609 S.E.2d\r\n597, 599-600 (Ct. App. 2005). Additionally, a party claiming a prescriptive\r\neasement under a claim of right must show a substantial belief that he had the right\r\nto use the property based on the totality of circumstances surrounding his use.\r\nMatthews v. Dennis, 365 S.C. 245, 250, 616 S.E.2d 437, 440 (Ct. App. 2005). This\r\n\"claim of right\" is \"without recognition of the rights of the owner of the\r\nservient estate.\" Id. n.10 (quoting 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 57\r\n(2004)) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n             [U]se by express or implied permission or license, no\r\n             matter how long continued, cannot ripen into an\r\n             easement by prescription, since user as of right, as\r\n             distinguished from permissive user, is lacking, if\r\n             permissive in its inception, such permissive character\r\n             will continue of the same nature, and no adverse user can\r\n             arise, until there is a distinct and positive assertion of a\r\n             right hostile to the owner, and brought home to him.\r\n\r\nWilliamson v. Abbott, 107 S.C. 397, 400-01, 93 S.E. 15, 16 (1917) (emphases\r\nadded); see also Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Epperson, 85 S.C. 134, 140, 67 S.E.\r\n\n235, 236 (1910) (holding that to establish a hostile use for purposes of adverse\r\npossession, there must be notice to the railroad of the adverse use, other than that\r\narising from the mere erection of a substantial enclosure).\r\n\r\n             The asking and obtaining of permission, whether from\r\n             the tenant or owner of the servient estate, stamps the\r\n             character of the use as not having been adverse, or\r\n             under claim of right, and therefore as lacking that\r\n             essential element which was necessary for it to ripen into\r\n             a right by prescription.\r\n\r\nWilliamson, 107 S.C. at 400-01, 93 S.E. at 16 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nB. Application to Landowner's Use\r\n\r\n1. Twenty Years' Use\r\n\r\nLandowner filed the present action on February 29, 2008. Therefore, to satisfy the\r\nfirst element of a prescriptive easement, Landowner must show continued and\r\nuninterrupted use of Railroad's right-of-way dating back to March 1, 1988.\r\nLandowner correctly argues that a party may \"tack\" the period of use of prior\r\nowners in order to satisfy the twenty-year element of the prescriptive easement\r\ntheory.8 However, the use by the previous owners must also satisfy all of the\r\nelements of a prescriptive easement. 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 63\r\n(2004 & Supp. 2012); see also Babb v. Harrison, 220 S.C. 20, 23, 66 S.E.2d 457,\r\n458 (1951) (holding that the claimant carries the burden of proving that the use of\r\nthe disputed area was adverse for the full period of twenty years in order to\r\nestablish an easement by prescription). Our examination of the evidence in the\r\npresent case yields no genuine factual issue as to whether the use of the right-of-\r\nway was \"adverse\" or \"under a claim of right\" for the requisite twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 See 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 63 (2004 & Supp. 2012) (\"The\r\nowner of a dominant estate generally need not show continued use by himself or\r\nherself for the entire prescriptive period, in order to establish an easement, but may\r\ntack the use[s] by his or her predecessors in title, where such successive owners are\r\nprivies in estate and their possessions constitute one continuous possession.\").\r\n\n2. Permissive versus Adverse Use\r\n\r\nGayle's testimony, as well as Paine's testimony, indicated that after Landowner\r\nacquired the Property, Paine and Gayle had developed a good relationship with\r\nRailroad's security officer, Steve Purvis. Gayle admitted that Railroad, through\r\nPurvis, had given Landowner tacit permission to cross the right-of-way. On one\r\noccasion, Gayle had asked Purvis if \"it would be better to access over the [railroad]\r\ntrack.\" Gayle testified that Purvis told him it would be \"much more dangerous\" for\r\nGayle and Paine to access the Property by crossing over the track. Further, on\r\nbehalf of Landowner, Gayle asked for, and received, Railroad's permission to\r\ninstall the gate on the access road. This permissive character of Landowner's use\r\nof the right-of-way is confirmed by Paine's affidavit. Although the conclusion of\r\nthis affidavit states \"we have requested legal acknowledgement of the existence of\r\nthe right to access our property,\" the overall tenor of the affidavit is that\r\nLandowner's use was with Railroad's permission and in recognition of Railroad's\r\nrights. Therefore, the affidavit does not show that the use was adverse or under a\r\nclaim of right. See Matthews, 365 S.C. at 250 n.10, 616 S.E.2d at 440 n.10\r\n(characterizing a claim of right as \"without recognition of the rights of the owner\r\nof the servient estate\") (quoting 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 57\r\n(2004)); Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Searson, 137 S.C. 468, 489, 135 S.E. 567, 573\r\n(1926) (\"The right of way of a railroad, having been acquired for a public purpose,\r\ncannot be lost by a prescriptive use or adverse possession, unless by the erection of\r\na permanent structure, accompanied by notice to the railroad company of an\r\nintention to claim adversely to its right.\" (quoting Atlanta & Charlotte Air-Line Ry.\r\nCo. v. Limestone-Globe Land Co., 109 S.C. 444, 96 S.E. 188 (1918))).\r\n\r\nMoreover, at oral argument, Landowner indicated that Gayle's reason for seeking\r\npermission to install the gate on the access road was to avoid interfering with\r\nRailroad's access. Landowner's implicit acknowledgement of Railroad's rights is\r\ninconsistent with a claim of right, which is \"without recognition of the rights of the\r\nowner of the servient estate.\" Matthews, 365 S.C. at 250 n.10, 616 S.E.2d at 440\r\nn.10 (quoting 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 57 (2004)). Notably,\r\nLandowner arranged for Railroad and SCE&G to possess keys to the locks on the\r\ngate. The gate was actually beneficial to Railroad as it limited access to the trestle\r\nby trespassers.\r\n\r\nIn sum, Railroad gave permission to Landowner to use its right-of-way, and there\r\nis no probative evidence showing that after Railroad granted this permission,\r\nLandowner made any distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to Railroad\r\nand \"brought home\" to Railroad. See Williamson, 107 S.C. at 400-01, 93 S.E. at 16\r\n\n(holding that the permissive character of the use will continue of the same nature\r\n\"until there is a distinct and positive assertion of a right hostile to the owner and\r\nbrought home to him\"); id. (\"The asking and obtaining of permission . . . stamps\r\nthe character of the use as not having been adverse, or under claim of right, and\r\ntherefore as lacking that essential element which was necessary for it to ripen into\r\na right by prescription.\").\r\n\r\nEven if Landowner's use could be characterized as adverse or under a claim of\r\nright, there is no probative evidence showing such an intent on the part of all\r\nprevious owners of the Property dating back to March 1, 1988. Specifically,\r\nLandowner relies in part on the affidavit of Dr. Alexander Murphey, Jr., an owner\r\nof Furey Development, Inc., Wayne King's immediate predecessor in title. Dr.\r\nMurpheyâ€™s affidavit indicates that his use of the right-of-way was without\r\nRailroad's permission and \"with the understanding that [Railroad] refused to grant\r\na right of way over and under its property.\"9 However, an intent to claim adversely\r\ncannot be inferred from this statement because it does not show an intention to\r\ndispossess Railroad. Cf. Brasington v. Williams, 143 S.C. 223, 264, 141 S.E. 375,\r\n388 (1927) (\"Adverse possession is hostile . . . and hostile possession . . . with\r\nintention to dispossess the owner.\" (citation omitted) (emphasis added)).\r\nLikewise, Dr. Murphey's affidavit does not show a \"claim of right\" to use the right-\r\nof-way because it shows that Dr. Murphey recognized the rights of Railroad. See\r\nMatthews, 365 S.C. at 250 n.10, 616 S.E.2d at 440 n.10 (characterizing a claim of\r\nright as without recognition of the rights of the owner of the servient estate)\r\n(quoting 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 57 (2004)). Similarly, the\r\ninclusion of the access road in the development plans drawn by Dr. Murphey's\r\nengineers does not show a claim or right or an intent to claim adversely.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no genuine factual issue as to whether the use of the right-of-way\r\nwas \"adverse\" or \"under a claim of right\" for the requisite twenty years, summary\r\njudgment on Landowner's prescriptive easement claim was proper.\r\n\r\nIV. Laches\r\n\r\nLandowner asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nRailroad on the issue of laches. We disagree.\r\n\r\n9 Incidentally, Furey's other owner, C.E. Carter, stated in his affidavit that he never\r\naccessed the Property by driving a motor vehicle on the access road under the\r\ntrestle; rather, he accessed the Property by foot and \"walked the [P]roperty on only\r\na few occasions.\"\r\n\n\"Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his rights, does not seasonably\r\nassert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his adversary to incur expenses or\r\nenter into obligations or otherwise detrimentally change his position, then equity\r\nwill ordinarily refuse to enforce those rights.\" Judy v. Judy, 383 S.C. 1, 7, 677\r\nS.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 2009), aff'd, 393 S.C. 160, 712 S.E.2d 408 (2011)\r\n(citation omitted). In other words, laches is neglect for an unreasonable and\r\nunexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for\r\ndiligence, to do what in law should have been done. Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).\r\n\r\nHere, assuming Landowner's assertion of laches is procedurally appropriate,10 the\r\nrecord does not show any actions by Railroad that were inconsistent with its\r\ncurrent position that Landowner has no legal right to cross the right-of-way. There\r\nis no evidence that Railroad was aware of Landowner's plans for a subdivision.\r\nTherefore, Railroad's permission for Landowner to use the access road in the\r\nmanner it had been used could not have been construed as permission to use it as a\r\nsubdivision entrance. Accordingly, any \"delay\" on the part of Railroad cannot be\r\ncharacterized as unreasonable. Judy, 383 S.C. at 7, 677 S.E.2d at 217\r\n(characterizing laches as an unreasonable delay in asserting one's rights, causing\r\nhis adversary to detrimentally change his position). Further, there is no indication\r\nthat Railroad has revoked permission for Paine or Gayle to cross the right-of-way\r\nfor their personal enjoyment of the Property and its prior improvements.\r\nTherefore, Landowner's expenses related to those improvements do not constitute a\r\ndetrimental change in position. Id.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to\r\nRailroad on the doctrine of laches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10In Byars v. Cherokee Cnty., 237 S.C. 548, 557-59, 118 S.E.2d 324, 329-\r\n330 (1961), the plaintiff in a quiet title action successfully asserted the doctrine of\r\nlaches and estoppel against Cherokee County; the supreme court affirmed the\r\nspecial referee's conclusion that Cherokee County was barred by laches and\r\nequitable estoppel to repudiate its sale of the plaintiff's property and the\r\nreconveyance of the land to the plaintiff. Notably, however, the supreme court's\r\nopinion still characterized laches as a defense. Id. at 559, 118 S.E.2d at 330.\r\nTherefore, even if a plaintiff may successfully assert laches against a defendant, it\r\nmust be in response to some assertion by the defendant.\r\n\nV. Easement by Necessity\r\n\r\nFinally, Landowner contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment to Railroad on the easement by necessity claim because access to the\r\nProperty by the Savannah River is inadequate as a matter of law. However, the\r\nnecessity for this type of easement must have existed at the time Railroad's\r\npredecessor in interest first obtained the right-of-way.\r\n\r\nThe elements of a claim for easement by necessity are: (1) unity of title, (2)\r\nseverance of title, and (3) necessity. Boyd v. Bellsouth Tel. & Tel. Co., 369 S.C.\r\n410, 418-19, 633 S.E.2d 136, 140-41 (2006). \"To establish unity of title, the\r\nowner of the dominant estate must show that his land and that of the owner of the\r\nservient estate once belonged to the same person.\" Kennedy v. Bedenbaugh, 352\r\nS.C. 56, 60, 572 S.E.2d 452, 454 (2002). Severance of title means that title to a\r\nlarger tract was \"severed\" by conveyance of a part to the plaintiff's predecessor in\r\ntitle and of a part to the defendant's predecessor in title; \"they both claim, from a\r\ncommon source, different parts of the integral tract, which necessarily assumes a\r\nseverance.\" Brasington, 143 S.C. at 246, 141 S.E. at 382 ; see also Turnbull v.\r\nRivers, 14 S.C.L. 131, 139 (Ct. App. 1825) (\"The necessity by which a person\r\nderives a right of way, is when one person sells to another lands inclosed on all\r\nsides by other lands. Here[,] the law imposes an obligation on the seller to allow\r\nthe purchaser a right of way over his adjacent land.\").\r\n\r\nIn cases involving the conveyance of a railroad right-of-way over the larger tract,\r\nas either an easement or a fee simple estate, the severance occurs at the time of the\r\nconveyance. See Miller, 94 S.C. at 109-10, 77 S.E. at 749-50 (Woods, J.\r\nconcurring) (stating that when a railroad acquires a right-of-way, dividing one tract\r\nof land into two parts, the law \"will hold that the intention was that the owner of\r\nthe land would of necessity have the right of crossing, if a crossing could be made\r\nso as not to interfere materially\" with the railroad's use of its right-of-way); cf.\r\nSchwarz & Schwarz, LLC v. Caldwell County R.R. Co., 677 S.E.2d 546, 548 (N.C.\r\nApp. 2009) (holding that a corporate landowner, who claimed an easement by\r\nnecessity to cross over a railroad right-of-way easement separating the landowner's\r\nproperty from a public road, had not established that the necessity for the crossing\r\narose out of its predecessor's conveyance of the right-of-way in 1902); id. at 548-\r\n49 (highlighting evidence showing that until the 1940s, when a railroad crossing\r\n\nwas constructed during the property's development, the property was a meadow\r\n\"possibly used as a berry patch\").11\r\n\r\n\"The necessity required for easement by necessity must be actual, real, and\r\nreasonable as distinguished from convenient, but need not be absolute and\r\nirresistible.\" Boyd, 369 S.C. at 420, 633 S.E.2d at 141. \"South Carolina requires\r\nonly 'reasonable necessity' to imply an easement: while the owner of the servient\r\nestate must prove more than convenience, he need not show the [easement] is\r\nabsolutely necessary.\" Graham v. Causey, 284 S.C. 339, 341, 326 S.E.2d 412, 414\r\n(Ct. App. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C.\r\n549, 357 S.E.2d 710 (1987) (citations omitted). \"The necessity element of\r\neasement by necessity must exist at the time of the severance and the party\r\nclaiming the right to an easement must not create the necessity when it would\r\nnot otherwise exist.\" Boyd, 369 S.C. at 420, 633 S.E.2d at 141 (citations omitted)\r\n(emphasis added). This is so because it is the severance that creates the necessity\r\nfor an easement and, thus, allows the law to impute to a landowner a right to cross\r\nan adjacent parcel. See Turnbull, 14 S.C.L. at 139 (\"The necessity by which a\r\nperson derives a right of way, is when one person sells to another lands inclosed on\r\nall sides by other lands. Here[,] the law imposes an obligation on the seller to\r\nallow the purchaser a right of way over his adjacent land.\").\r\n\r\nFurther, \"reasonable access to a road over navigable water will prevent the\r\nimplication of a way of necessity, even though a way by land may be more\r\nconvenient.\" 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 38 (2004), cited with\r\napproval in Inlet Harbour v. S.C. Dep't of Parks, Recreation & Tourism, 377 S.C.\r\n86, 97 n.4, 659 S.E.2d 151, 157 n.4 (2008); but see Graham, 284 S.C. 339, 342,\r\n326 S.E.2d 412, 414 (Ct. App. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by Jowers\r\n\r\n11 See also Town of Bedford v. Cerasuolo, 818 N.E.2d 561, 567 (Mass. App. 2004)\r\n(holding that a landowner's need to establish a way to access the southern parcel of\r\nhis tract arose upon his conveyance of a strip of land to a railroad in 1873, which\r\nhad the effect of dividing his tract and leaving the tract's southern parcel\r\nlandlocked); State v. Beeson, 232 S.W.3d 265, 273-74 (Tex. App. 2007) (noting\r\nthat landowners, who sought an easement by necessity to cross a railroad right-of-\r\nway, did not have any evidence of the manner in which their predecessors in\r\ninterest used a tract of land at the time that the right-of-way, which severed the\r\ntract, came into existence in 1893); id. at 274 (stating that the landowners merely\r\nrelied on the general allegation that their predecessors would have needed to cross\r\nthe right-of-way to access the northern strip of their property that was cut off from\r\nthe remainder of their tract by the right-of-way).\r\n\nv. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 357 S.E.2d 710 (1987) (holding that because the\r\nplaintiff's land was bordered by a lake and property belonging to others, the\r\nrequirement that the necessity \"must have existed at the time of the grant\" was\r\nsatisfied because \"ever since [the plaintiff's] tract was severed [in the 1960s,] an\r\neasement . . . has been necessary\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\nHere, Landowner argues that precluding an easement by necessity when the\r\nproperty at issue can be accessed by navigable waters is \"an antiquated notion.\" In\r\nsupport of this argument, Landowner cites an opinion issued by the Supreme Court\r\nof Arkansas, Attaway v. Davis, 707 S.W.2d 302 (Ark. 1986).12 In response to an\r\nargument that an easement by necessity should not be granted in light of the\r\ndominant estate's frontage on a navigable water course, the court stated that the\r\nnecessity need only be reasonable, not absolute. Id. at 303. The court further\r\nstated, \"Now that travel even for short distances is almost always by motor vehicle,\r\nit is not reasonable to require the appellee and those wishing to visit her to make\r\nthe trip by boat.\" Id.\r\n\r\nWhile Landowner's argument is appealing, it overlooks the critical aspect of\r\ntiming. Although South Carolina requires only \"reasonable necessity\" to imply an\r\neasement,13 the reasonable necessity must have existed at the time of the\r\nseverance. Boyd, 369 S.C. at 420, 633 S.E.2d at 141. Here, the severance\r\noccurred in 1878 when Railroad's predecessor in interest obtained its right-of-way\r\nover a larger tract of land that included the 15.6 acres now owned by Landowner;\r\nthe right-of-way severed the larger tract, leaving access to the 15.6 acres only by\r\nthe Savannah River. Cf. Graham, 284 S.C. at 340, 326 S.E.2d at 413 (indicating\r\nthat the severance creating the necessity occurred in the 1960s).\r\n\r\nIn 1878, it would not have been unreasonable or antiquated to require a landowner\r\nto access his property by water in the absence of evidence of adverse\r\nenvironmental conditions. Cf. Brasington, 143 S.C. at 250, 141 S.E. at 384\r\n(recounting the plaintiff's testimony regarding the conditions of a river and its\r\nbanks at the location of the plaintiff's property and the adverse effect of these\r\nconditions on the ability to access the property by the river). Landowner did not\r\npresent any evidence of environmental conditions in 1878 that would prevent\r\n\r\n12 Landowner also cites 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements & Licenses Â§ 38 (2004) for the\r\nproposition that there is a trend in the courts toward a more liberal interpretation of\r\neasements by necessity despite access by water.\r\n13 See Graham, 284 S.C. at 341, 326 S.E.2d at 414 (requiring only \"reasonable\r\nnecessity\").\r\n\nreasonable access to the Property by the Savannah River. Therefore, we are\r\nconstrained to affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Railroad on\r\nLandowner's easement by necessity claim.\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity to emphasize our previous conclusion that regardless of\r\nthe interest a person has in a railroad right-of-way, whether it is the underlying fee,\r\nsome type of an easement, or a mere license to cross the right-of-way, that person\r\nmay not interfere with the railroad's use of its right-of-way for the purpose of\r\nfurthering its business. See Faulkenberry v. Norfolk S. Ry.

Lewis (Wife)\r\nbased upon an imputed monthly income to him of $2,900.00, (2) failing to award\r\nthe parties joint custody of their minor child or, alternatively, failing to award\r\nHusband more than standard visitation, (3) finding Husband's therapy counselor\r\nwas unaware of certain matters involving Husband, and (4) requiring each party to\r\npay his or her own attorney's fees. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in\r\npart.\r\n\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife were married on September 2, 2001, and have one child from\r\nthe marriage (Son), who was born on April 27, 2004. The parties separated on\r\nOctober 29, 2006, following an incident between the two, wherein both alleged a\r\nphysical assault by the other. Wife left the marital residence with Son at that time,\r\nand filed a complaint and motion for pendente lite relief on an expedited basis on\r\nOctober 31, 2006. Following a November hearing, the court issued a temporary\r\norder on December 14, 2006, granting Wife custody of Son and ordering Husband\r\nto pay $1,024 a month in child support, based upon the child support guidelines\r\nand submitted financial declarations. The court further ordered that, upon Husband\r\nproviding a letter from his counselor, Dr. Samer Touma, Husband was entitled to\r\nvisitation every other weekend from Friday until Sunday, two hours on\r\nWednesdays during weeks he did not have overnight visitation, and for a three day\r\nperiod during the Christmas holidays that year. On March 7, 2008, the court\r\nsubsequently modified Husband's visitation, extending the weekend visitation until\r\nMonday morning and providing for visitation during the Thanksgiving and\r\nChristmas holidays, as well as during spring break, Easter, and the summer\r\nmonths. On April 11, 2008, Husband filed a motion for pendente lite relief,\r\nalleging he became unemployed on April 2, 2008, and seeking a decrease in his\r\nchild support payments. The family court issued an order on May 15, 2008,\r\ndenying Husband's request, but allowing Husband to use his equity in the marital\r\nhome as an advance against his share of equitable distribution for purposes of\r\nfulfilling his obligation. On September 24, 2008, Husband filed a motion, on an\r\nexpedited basis, to require a psychological evaluation of the parties for use in\r\ndetermining the best interests of Son in regard to the custody issue. On October\r\n17, 2008 the family court granted this motion, appointing a clinical psychologist,\r\nDr. Marc Harari, to conduct the psychological evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe case was heard by the family court over a period of three days in November\r\n2008, and February and March 2009. By order dated July 10, 2009, the family\r\ncourt issued a final decree of divorce in the matter, finding Wife entitled to a\r\ndivorce on the ground of one year of continuous separation of the parties. The\r\ncourt denied Husband's request for joint custody, finding this case was not\r\nappropriate for same. The court granted Wife's request and denied Husband's for\r\nprimary custody, finding it in Son's best interest to remain with Wife. The court\r\nfurther granted Husband visitation every other weekend from Friday evening until\r\nMonday morning, Mondays following non-visitation weekends from 5:00 p.m. to\r\n7:30 p.m., and ordered a split schedule between the parties for Thanksgiving,\r\n\nChristmas, spring break and Easter, to be followed on a yearly rotating basis\r\nbetween the parties. Husband also received four non-consecutive weeks of\r\nvisitation during the summer. Additionally, the family court found Husband was\r\nunemployed at that time, but imputed an income to him of $2,900.00 a month, or\r\n$34,800.00 annually, and ordered Husband to pay $125.00 a week in child support\r\nbased upon the child support guidelines. The family court further reserved the\r\nright to review Husband's child support obligation upon him securing employment.\r\nThe court held the issue of attorney's fees and costs in abeyance, pending counsels'\r\narguments on the matter and the court's review of settlement negotiations.\r\n\r\nHusband filed a motion to reconsider, challenging the court's final decree in several\r\naspects, including the family court's failure to grant him joint custody, or\r\nalternatively, increased visitation, failure to consider the full testimony of Dr.\r\nTouma based upon a finding Dr. Touma was unaware of certain matters, and\r\nimputation of a monthly income of $2,900.00 to him. Following a hearing on the\r\nmatter, the family court partially granted Husband's motion, modifying certain\r\naspects of its order not in issue on appeal, but declining to do so in the above\r\nmatters. Thereafter, the family court considered written argument of both parties,\r\nand declined to award attorney fees to either, finding Husband and Wife were\r\nresponsible for their respective attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.     Whether the family court erred in awarding child support based upon an\r\nimputed gross monthly income to Husband of $2,900.00 because there was\r\ninsufficient evidence to support this amount.\r\n\r\n2.     Whether the family court erred in failing to award the parties joint custody\r\nof Son or, in the alternative, to award Husband additional visitation with Son.\r\n\r\n3.     Whether the family court erred in finding Dr. Samer Touma was unaware of\r\ncertain issues regarding Husband, because the clear and uncontradicted testimony\r\nof Dr. Touma was that he was aware of the issues.\r\n\r\n4.     Whether the family court erred in requiring each party to pay his or her own\r\nattorney's fees, because the evidence shows Wife should be required to contribute\r\nto Husband's attorney's fees.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, an appellate court reviews factual and legal issues\r\nde novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011).\r\n\"De novo review permits appellate court fact-finding, notwithstanding the presence\r\nof evidence supporting the trial court's findings.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381,\r\n390, 709 S.E.2d 650, 654-55 (2011). However, while this court has the authority\r\nto find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence,\r\n\"we recognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\" Id. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655. Further, de novo review does not\r\nrelieve an appellant of his burden to \"demonstrate error in the family court's\r\nfindings of fact.\" Id. \"Consequently, the family court's factual findings will be\r\naffirmed unless appellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of the evidence\r\nis against the finding of the [family] court.\" Id. (alteration in original) (internal\r\ncitation and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Imputed Income\r\n\r\nHusband first contends the family court erred and abused its discretion in awarding\r\nchild support based upon an imputed gross monthly income of $2,900.00, because\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to support the imputation of income and the\r\ncorresponding child support award. We agree.\r\n\r\nOur law is clear that, in determining child support or alimony obligations, the\r\nfamily court has the discretion to impute income to a party who is voluntarily\r\nunemployed or underemployed.\r\n\r\n             If the obligor spouse has the ability to earn more income\r\n             than he is in fact earning, the court may impute income\r\n             according to what he could earn by using his or her best\r\n             efforts to gain employment equal to his capabilities, and\r\n             an award of [support] based on such imputation may be a\r\n             proper exercise of discretion even if it exhausts the\r\n             obligor spouse's actual income.\r\n\r\nDixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 240, 512 S.E.2d 539, 548 (Ct. App. 1999) (internal\r\ncitation and quotation marks omitted); see also Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 532,\r\n599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (Patel II); Blackwell v. Fulcrum, 375 S.C. 337, 347,\r\n\n652 S.E.2d 427, 432 (Ct. App. 2007) (noting it is appropriate to impute income to a\r\nparty who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed when determining child\r\nsupport obligations). \"Whether termed voluntary underemployment, imputation of\r\nincome, or the failure to reach earning potential, the case law is clear that when a\r\npayor spouse seeks to reduce support obligations based on his diminished income,\r\na court should consider the payor spouse's earning capacity.\" Marchant v.\r\nMarchant, 390 S.C. 1, 9, 699 S.E.2d 708, 712 (Ct. App. 2010) (quoting Gartside v.\r\nGartside, 383 S.C. 35, 44, 677 S.E.2d 621, 626 (Ct. App. 2009)).\r\n\r\nIn Sanderson v. Sanderson, 391 S.C. 249, 253-54, 705 S.E.2d 65, 66-67 (Ct. App.\r\n2010), this court addressed a similar situation wherein the family court had\r\nimputed an annual income of $64,000 to the husband after he lost his position\r\nearning $95,000, as a result of corporate downsizing. There, we noted the South\r\nCarolina Child Support Guidelines specifically provide that \"[i]n order to impute\r\nincome to a parent who is unemployed or underemployed, the court should\r\ndetermine the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent\r\nbased on that parent's recent work history, occupational qualifications, and\r\nprevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community.\" Id. at 256, 705\r\nS.E.2d at 68; S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(B) (Supp. 2011). We further\r\nacknowledged in Sanderson, while a bad faith motivation is not required for a\r\nfinding of voluntary underemployment, \"the motivation behind any purported\r\nreduction in income or earning capacity should be considered in determining\r\nwhether a parent is voluntarily underemployed.\" Id. Additionally, \"[w]hen actual\r\nincome versus earning capacity is at issue, courts should closely examine a good-\r\nfaith and reasonable explanation for the decreased income.\" Id. After noting there\r\nwas no dispute that the husband lost his job through no fault of his own, this court\r\nthen went on to review the evidence of record as related to the factors set forth in\r\nthe guidelines and determined the family court abused its discretion in imputing an\r\nannual income of $64,000 to Husband, and that remand of the matter to the family\r\ncourt was proper to calculate Husband's income based upon the evidence of record.\r\nId. at 256-58, 705 S.E.2d at 68-69.\r\n\r\nIn regard to child support, the court's final order provides in pertinent part as\r\nfollows:     [Husband] is currently unemployed. Based upon his\r\n             work history and income, this Court imputes a gross\r\n             monthly income to [Husband] of $2,900.00, or\r\n             $34,800.00 annually. [Wife] is currently employed and\r\n             earns a gross monthly income of $6,669.00 per month.\r\n\n            [Wife] pays $125.00 per month toward the child health\r\n            and dental insurance through her employer and $518.00\r\n            per month in daycare expenses. Based upon the Child\r\n            Support Guidelines, [Husband] shall pay [Wife] One\r\n            Hundred Twenty-Five and No/100 Dollars ($125.00) per\r\n            week in child support. . . . This court specifically reserves\r\n            the right to review [Husband's] child support obligation\r\n            upon his securing employment of which [Husband] shall\r\n            notify [Wife] within 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe family court made no finding whatsoever as to whether Husband was at fault\r\nin losing his job, whether he was voluntarily unemployed, or whether he put forth\r\nhis best efforts to gain employment equal to his capabilities. More importantly, it\r\nfailed to address the necessary factors delineated by the child support guidelines\r\nconcerning recent work history, occupational qualifications, prevailing job\r\nopportunities and earning levels in the community. Additionally, there is nothing\r\nin the record to suggest how the family court arrived at the annual income figure of\r\n$34,800 to be imputed to Husband. Further, the family court specifically\r\nacknowledged at the hearing on Husband's motion for reconsideration that it did\r\nnot remember why it arrived at that figure. The family court failed to address the\r\nfactors required by the guidelines, and we simply cannot find evidence in the\r\nrecord before us to support the court's imputation figure of $34,800. Therefore,\r\nafter de novo review, we remand the imputation of income to the family court\r\npursuant to Sanderson for reconsideration based upon the factors set forth in the\r\nChild Support Guidelines.1\r\n\r\nB.    Custody and Visitation\r\n\r\nHusband next contends the family court erred in failing to award the parties joint\r\ncustody over Son or, alternatively, failing to award him additional visitation with\r\nSon. He argues joint custody is generally awarded in exceptional circumstances,\r\nand such circumstances exist in this case. He maintains the actions of Wife show\r\nthe only way he will have any meaningful time with Son is through a specific court\r\norder, as Wife would not permit visitation outside the court order. Husband\r\ncontends, because he and Wife do not communicate well, joint custody would be\r\nhealthiest, as it keeps the child from developing a negative perception of the non-\r\n\r\n1Because we are remanding for reconsideration the issue of imputed income, upon\r\nestablishing the imputed amount, the family court should also determine the matter\r\nof retroactivity.\r\n\ncustodial parent. In the alternative, Husband argues that should this court believe\r\njoint custody is not appropriate, he should be allowed more than the standard\r\nvisitation awarded by the family court.\r\n\r\nIn making a custody determination, the child's welfare and best interest are the\r\nparamount and controlling considerations of the court. Patel II, 359 S.C. at 526,\r\n599 S.E.2d at 119. As with determinations of child custody, the welfare and best\r\ninterests of the child are the primary considerations in determining visitation.\r\nPaparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 191, 531 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nIn determining the best interests of the child, the family court considers several\r\nfactors \"including: who has been the primary caretaker; the conduct, attributes,\r\nand fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties (including GAL, expert\r\nwitnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and sex of the children.\"\r\nMcComb v. Conard, 394 S.C. 416, 422, 715 S.E.2d 662, 665 (Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(quoting Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d 386, 388 (2001) (Patel I)).\r\n\"Although the legislature gives family court judges the authority to order joint or\r\ndivided custody where the court finds it is in the best interests of the child, . . . joint\r\nor divided custody should only be awarded where there are exceptional\r\ncircumstances.\" Patel II, 359 S.C. at 528, 599 S.E.2d at 121; S.C. Code Ann Â§ 63-\r\n3-530(A)(42) (2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \"Absent\r\nexceptional circumstances, the law regards joint custody as typically harmful to the\r\nchildren and not in their best interests.\" Spreeuw v. Barker, 385 S.C. 45, 61, 682\r\nS.E.2d 843, 851 (Ct. App. 2009). In determining joint custody is usually\r\nconsidered harmful to and not conducive to the best interest and welfare of a child,\r\nour courts have explained the disfavor as follows:\r\n\r\n              The courts generally endeavor to avoid dividing the\r\n              custody of a child between contending parties, and are\r\n              particularly reluctant to award the custody of a child in\r\n              brief alternating periods between estranged and\r\n              quarrelsome persons. Under the facts and circumstances\r\n              of particular cases, it has been held improper to apportion\r\n              the custody of a child between its parents, or between one\r\n              of its parents and a third party, for ordinarily it is not\r\n              conducive to the best interests and welfare of a child for\r\n              it to be shifted and shuttled back and forth in alternate\r\n              brief periods between contending parties, particularly\r\n              during the school term. Furthermore, such an\r\n              arrangement is likely to cause confusion, interfere with\r\n              the proper training and discipline of the child, make the\r\n\n             child the basis of many quarrels between its custodians,\r\n             render its life unhappy and discontented, and prevent it\r\n             from living a normal life.\r\n\r\nScott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 125-26, 579 S.E.2d 620, 624 (2003) (quoting Mixson\r\nv. Mixson, 253 S.C. 436, 447, 171 S.E.2d 581, 586 (1969)). 2\r\n\r\nAfter review of the record de novo, we find Husband has not met his burden of\r\nconvincing us the family court's determination regarding custody and visitation is\r\nagainst the preponderance of the evidence.\r\n\r\nAs to joint custody, the record shows both Dr. Harari and Dr. Touma considered\r\njoint custody to be a more viable option when the parents can cooperate with each\r\nother. Specifically, Dr. Harari, who was qualified as an expert in counseling\r\npsychology, testified that based upon his evaluation of the parties, joint custody or\r\nshared custody would not be appropriate in this case because of the \"immense\r\ndisagreement between these parties.\" He noted, although both parents claimed\r\nthey were trying to cooperate with the other, they had been through hours of\r\nunsuccessful mediation. Dr. Harari thus found \"having them share in equal\r\ncustody just doesn't seem realistic.\" He further concluded, within a reasonable\r\ndegree of medical certainty, Wife presented in a more credible and realistic manner\r\nduring the testing process. Further, although Dr. Harari acknowledged there was a\r\npotential for joint physical custody of Son due to the parties' geographic proximity,\r\nhe was concerned with the communication problems between the parties. Dr.\r\nHarari clarified, however, he did not recommend joint legal custody, and though\r\njoint physical custody was potentially possible, the mistrust between the parties\r\noutweighed their geographic proximity. Finally, Dr. Harari expressed concern in\r\nregard to joint custody based upon Husband's response pattern on the administered\r\npsychological testing, which indicated there needed to be a higher degree of\r\ncaution with Husband.3 Dr. Touma, who was qualified as an expert in counseling\r\n\r\n2 We note that in Scott, our supreme court concluded our legislative statute\r\ngoverning the family court's jurisdiction, which specifically grants the family court\r\nthe exclusive jurisdiction \"to order joint or divided custody where the court finds it\r\nis in the best interests of the child,\" currently codified in section 63-3-530(A)(42),\r\ndoes not change the law in this State that, generally, joint custody is disfavored.\r\n354 S.C. at 125, 579 S.E.2d at 623-24.\r\n3 With regard to Husband, Dr. Harari found his response pattern on all four tests\r\nadministered to show his \"validity indices was considered socially desirable and\r\noverly favorable meaning it was not a realistic [portrayal] of his true functioning\r\n\nand family therapy, testified that the more time a child spends with both parents,\r\nthe more the child's adjustment issues are reduced and it is therefore beneficial to\r\nthe child. However, Dr. Touma also qualified this opinion, stating \"it's best if the\r\nparents can get along and cooperate and find a way to work together.\" He further\r\nnoted, based on recent research, the ideal situation involving divorce is for two\r\nparents to split time with the child, but stated \"the most important component is no\r\nhostility or controversy between the parents,\" and if the parents can cooperate and\r\ncollaborate, equal time is good for the child. Dr. Touma also agreed that Dr.\r\nHarari was in a better position than him to offer a custody recommendation or\r\nopinion to the court.\r\n\r\nAs noted, our courts generally disfavor joint custody since, ordinarily, it is not\r\nconducive to the best interest and welfare of a child to be shuttled back and forth in\r\nalternate brief periods between parents. Further, our courts are particularly\r\nreluctant to award joint custody between estranged and quarrelsome parents. Here,\r\nnot only has Husband failed to show exceptional circumstances warranting an\r\naward of joint custody, the evidence of record supports the conclusion that joint\r\ncustody in this case would not be in the best interest of Son given the acrimonious\r\nrelationship between Husband and Wife.\r\n\r\nAs to extended visitation, we find no error in the amount of visitation the family\r\ncourt awarded Husband for the same reasons as noted above. Our review of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence convinces us that, given the lack of cooperation and\r\ncommunication between the parties, allowing Husband more extensive visitation\r\nwould not be in Son's best interest.\r\n\r\nIn Paparella, relied upon by Husband, this court agreed with the father's assertion\r\nthat he should have been awarded expanded visitation. 340 S.C. at 191, 531\r\nS.E.2d at 300. There, the family court awarded father visitation with the children\r\nevery other weekend, beginning on Friday at 6 p.m. and ending on Sunday at 6\r\np.m. Id. The mother admitted during trial that the father should be awarded more\r\n\r\nlevel,\" indicating he possibly presented only his most positive attributes. An\r\nalternative explanation was that Husband suffered from a personality disorder\r\nsuggestive of someone with a high degree of narcissism, but Dr. Harari believed,\r\nbased upon the data he received from Dr. Touma and other information, that it was\r\nmore likely Husband responded over favorably and unrealistically. Dr. Harari\r\nnoted in his report that Husband was reluctant to admit to common flaws that most\r\nindividuals typically endorse, and determined Husband exhibited heightened levels\r\nof positive impression management defensiveness.\r\n\nvisitation than this. Id. Further, the record showed that the father was involved in\r\nraising his children and in their day-to-day activities, and that while the parties\r\nwere married, they worked as pharmacists at the same drugstore and were able to\r\narrange their schedules so that one parent was home with the children while the\r\nother parent was at work, thus eliminating the need for the children to be in\r\ndaycare. Id. Based on these circumstances, this court agreed that the father should\r\nbe allowed more visitation with the children, and modified the visitation schedule\r\nto provide the father visitation every other weekend during the school year,\r\nbeginning after school on Friday and ending when they returned to school Monday\r\nmorning, as well as on the Thursday preceding the weekend when the father did\r\nnot have visitation, from after school until they returned to school Friday morning,\r\nand on the Tuesday following the weekend when he did not have visitation, from\r\nafter school until they returned to school Wednesday morning. Id. at 191-92, 531\r\nS.E.2d at 300. We also determined the father's summer visitation should be\r\nexpanded to half of the children's summer vacation. Id. at 192, 531 S.E.2d at 300.\r\nIn the case at hand, evidence of record shows Husband was not as involved in\r\nSon's life prior to the parties' separation.4 Further, Husband's visitation was not as\r\nlimited by the family court as was that of the father in Paparella. Finally, Wife did\r\nnot agree during the trial that Husband should receive more visitation, as did the\r\nwife in Paparella.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while Husband strenuously argues the importance of allowing joint\r\ncustody or expanded visitation to insure the continued quality relationship between\r\nHusband and Son, we find no evidence in the record that Husband and Son's\r\nrelationship is in jeopardy based upon the visitation awarded by the court. Further,\r\nas noted by the Guardian Ad Litem and the family court in the hearing on\r\nHusband's motion for reconsideration, Husband received fairly significant\r\nvisitation from the court, with the court expanding his time somewhat from the\r\nprevious temporary court order. Additionally, the court noted the testimony of the\r\ndaycare provider concerning problems with Husband dropping child off at the\r\nappropriate time. Lastly, the court at this hearing noted that it had closely divided\r\nthe summer by giving Husband four weeks of visitation. Accordingly, we find the\r\n\r\n\r\n4Though Husband claimed the parties shared equally in caring for Son before the\r\nseparation, Wife testified, as well as presented other witnesses, to the contrary.\r\nGiven the problems with Husband's credibility, as noted below, we do not believe\r\nHusband has met his burden of convincing us by the preponderance of the\r\nevidence that he was involved with Son like the father was involved with raising\r\nhis children in Paparella.\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence supports the family court's order concerning\r\nvisitation.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the record before us does not reflect that the evidence is so clearly in\r\nHusband's favor to warrant a finding of an abuse of discretion by the family court,\r\nand Husband has failed to sustain his burden of convincing this court that the\r\nfamily court did not consider Son's welfare and best interest in its custody and\r\nvisitation decision.\r\n\r\nC.    Finding Regarding Dr. Touma\r\n\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred in finding Dr. Touma was unaware of\r\ncertain issues regarding Husband, because the uncontradicted evidence was clear\r\nthat Dr. Touma was aware of these matters. Specifically, Husband argues that\r\nWife attempted to make an issue of allegations that Husband had, in the past,\r\npunched a hole in a wall and torn up photographs, and the family court made a\r\nfinding that Dr. Touma was unaware of these incidents. He argues, in spite of the\r\nfact that the court was presented with Dr. Touma's testimony during the motion for\r\nreconsideration that he was aware of the incidents and Husband took responsibility\r\nfor them, the court declined to modify its finding in this regard.\r\n\r\nAt the final hearing, Wife testified to numerous instances of hostile or aggressive\r\nbehavior by Husband, including the following: routinely mistreating and\r\nthreatening Wife's dog; instances of throwing objects such as phones, remote\r\ncontrols, alarms, and camcorders; beating on and damaging a locked bedroom\r\ndoor, causing Husband to break his wrist; and punching a hole in the wall.\r\nAdditionally, Wife testified that, after she purchased a package of pictures of Son\r\nfor around $200, Husband asked to see the pictures and then proceeded to rip them\r\ninto pieces in front of her and Son. Wife also testified Husband threatened to\r\ndivorce her, and told her he would \"break [her] mentally, financially and\r\nphysically.\" Finally, Wife submitted into evidence a note written to her by\r\nHusband during the marriage which stated, \"I WISH YOU WOULD LEAVE!\"\r\n\r\nIn response to Wife's allegation in her complaint that Husband beat the dog,\r\nHusband admitted in his answer that he did beat the dog, but \"affirmatively\r\nassert[ed] that the dog required discipline.\" During his testimony, however,\r\nHusband denied that he beat the dog, claiming he only spanked the dog with Wife's\r\npermission, and asserted the admission in his answer was a \"misstatement\" by his\r\nattorney. Husband admitted he broke his wrist punching a hole in a bedroom door,\r\nand also admitted writing the note to Wife saying he wished she would leave. He\r\n\nfurther admitted tearing up the pictures of Son, stating he was disappointed and\r\nhurt because the parties had agreed on a less expensive package, and claimed he\r\ntore up the pictures \"to prove a point.\" He likewise admitted putting his fist\r\nthrough a wall, explaining he was hurt and upset at things Wife had said to him\r\nduring an incident with the dog. Yet, Husband repeatedly denied that he had a\r\ntemper or that he was angry during the various incidents, and denied being abusive\r\ntoward Wife. We find Husband's credibility is suspect.\r\n\r\nDuring cross-examination, Dr. Touma testified Husband had indicated he did not\r\nanticipate the breakup with Wife, and it happened abruptly. When Wife's attorney\r\nasked, had Dr. Touma known Husband left Wife the note stating he wished she\r\nwould leave some one and a half years prior to the separation, whether Dr. Touma\r\nwould have delved into that more, Dr. Touma stated that, had he known that, he\r\nwould have asked Husband why he would have written that note. When asked if\r\nhe saw any evidence of temper with Husband, Dr. Touma replied, \"Not that I can\r\ntalk about.\" Counsel then showed Dr. Touma the photographs of Son that\r\nHusband had torn and asked if he would have delved into those issues deeper had\r\nhe known, and Dr. Touma responded, \"Well, well, yeah, and I did delve into the\r\nissues of anger and frustration because he was angry initially regarding what took\r\nplace and how these things transpired.\" Dr. Touma stated Husband talked to him\r\nabout losing his temper, and Husband mentioned \"about punching the hole at one\r\ntime.\" When asked if he found Husband tended to blame everybody but himself\r\nfor what happened during the marriage, Dr. Touma stated Husband did blame\r\nothers, but he also \"took responsibility for things such as . . . punching the wall . . .\r\nand all these things.\"\r\n\r\nIn its final order, under the section concerning the granting of a divorce, the family\r\ncourt made findings of fact regarding Husband's complaints with the dog, Dr.\r\nTouma's testimony, and Husband's dispute with the findings of Dr. Harari, before\r\nfinding Wife was entitled to a divorce on the ground of one year of continuous\r\nseparation. As to Dr. Touma, the court noted Dr. Touma testified he did not find\r\nHusband to have any anger problems, but had admitted he was unaware Husband\r\npunched holes in the wall, had torn up photographs of Son, or had written a note to\r\nWife asking her to leave.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear from Dr. Touma's testimony whether he was actually made aware of\r\nthe incident where Husband tore up the photographs of Son. It is clear, however,\r\nthat Dr. Touma was made aware that Husband punched at least one hole in the wall\r\nand Husband \"took responsibility for such things as . . . punching the wall.\"\r\nHowever, the court only made this finding in relation to the divorce between the\r\n\nparties, and there is no indication it considered this in regard to any of the other\r\nmatters. Further, though the finding was inaccurate as concerned Dr. Touma's\r\nawareness that Husband punched a hole in the wall, the record supports its finding\r\nconcerning the note left for Wife, and is ambiguous as to the torn photographs.\r\nAdditionally, based upon the record before us, we do not believe this finding by\r\nthe court is any more damaging to Husband than the other evidence presented.\r\nAccordingly, we find any error in the court's determination concerning Dr.\r\nTouma's knowledge of Husband's behavior to be harmless. See McCall v. Finley,\r\n294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting our appellate courts\r\nrecognize an overriding rule which says: \"whatever doesn't make any difference,\r\ndoesn't matter.\").\r\n\r\nD.    Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nLastly, Husband contends the family court erred in requiring each party to pay his\r\nor her own attorney's fees, asserting the evidence supported a conclusion Wife\r\nshould be required to contribute to Husband's fees. He argues the manner in which\r\nWife chose to begin this action, requesting an expedited hearing, created an\r\natmosphere of fear and mistrust which permeated the case, prejudiced Husband,\r\nand required the filing and hearing of numerous motions. Husband asserts Wife\r\nprolonged this case. He also contends he ultimately received greater than normal\r\ncontact with Son, despite Wife's efforts to limit and restrict Husband's time with\r\nhim. Further, Husband notes he lost his job during the pendency of the case, while\r\nWife remained gainfully employed. Based upon the factors to be considered in\r\ndetermining whether any attorney's fees should be awarded, Husband argues he\r\nwas entitled to an award of fees. Additionally, Husband argues that, if this court\r\ndisagrees with his argument that he is entitled to attorney's fees under the case law,\r\nshould it reverse the family court on any issue in this matter, the issue of attorney's\r\nfees and costs should be remanded.\r\n\r\nThe decision to award attorney's fees is within the family court's sound discretion,\r\nand although appellate review of such an award is de novo, the appellant still has\r\nthe burden of showing error in the family court's findings of fact. Chisholm v.\r\nChisholm, 396 S.C. 507, 510, 722 S.E.2d 222, 223-24 (2012). In deciding whether\r\nto award attorney's fees and costs, the court should consider the following factors:\r\n(1) the ability of the party to pay the fees; (2) beneficial results obtained; (3) the\r\nfinancial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect a fee award will have on the\r\nparty's standard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n812, 816 (1992). Though we would generally be inclined to determine an award of\r\nattorney's fees in accordance with the factors outlined in E.D.M. v. T.A.M., where\r\n\n\"the case before us presents an added dimension of an uncooperative spouse who\r\nhampers a final resolution of the issues in dispute, we will not reward an adversary\r\nspouse for such conduct.\" Blackwell, 375 at 346, 652 S.E.2d at 431. Further,\r\nwhen parties fail to cooperate and their behavior prolongs the proceedings, this is a\r\nbasis for holding the parties responsible for their own attorney's fees. Lewin v.\r\nLewin, 396 S.C. 349, 356, 721 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 2011). \"An adversary spouse\r\nshould not be rewarded for such conduct.\" Anderson v. Tolbert, 322 S.C. 543, 549,\r\n473 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nHere, we note that at the time of trial, Husband had managed to pay a substantial\r\nportion of the attorney's fees he incurred with three separate attorneys. See Patel\r\nII, 359 S.C. at 533, 599 S.E.2d at 123 (finding Wife had not shown she was unable\r\nto pay her attorney's fees where Wife had paid a $35,000 portion of fees and\r\nexpenses totaling more than $90,000). More importantly, our review of the record\r\nreflects that Husband was, if not primarily, at least equally to blame for the\r\nprotracted litigation in this matter, and this failure to cooperate supports the family\r\ncourt's determination that each party should be responsible for his and her own\r\nattorney's fees. We find further support for this in the position taken by Husband\r\nduring his motion for reconsideration, wherein his attorney stated, \"I cannot\r\nimagine, when you apply the law to the financial circumstances of these parties,\r\nthat there would be any other outcome other than they would each pay their own\r\nfees.\" Accordingly, we find no error in the denial of attorney's fees to Husband,\r\neven in light of our recommended remand on the issue concerning imputed\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse and remand the matter of imputed income to\r\nHusband and affirm the remaining issues.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5051","title":"Riley v.

Aurora's title was based on a deed it received\r\nfrom the master-in-equity after Aurora successfully prosecuted a mortgage\r\nforeclosure action against Harriet Felder. Felder's deed to the property came from\r\nUlysses Green acting as personal representative of his father's estate.

He\r\nappeals his sentence, arguing the circuit court erred in treating him as a second\r\noffender based on his previous burglary conviction in Georgia. We affirm.\r\n\nBurglary in the third degree is defined in section 16-11-313 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2003). Subsection 16-11-313(B) provides: \"Burglary in the third degree is a\r\nfelony punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years for conviction on a\r\nfirst offense and for not more than ten years for conviction of a second offense\r\naccording to the discretion of the Court.\" Before accepting Donahue's plea, the\r\ncircuit court ruled that his Georgia conviction triggered the enhanced sentencing\r\nrange in subsection 16-11-313(B). The court sentenced Donahue to ten years in\r\nprison, suspended upon service of six years, and two years of probation.\r\n\r\nThe State argues Donahue waived his right to challenge the circuit court's ruling by\r\npleading guilty. We disagree. A criminal defendant does not give up his right to\r\nchallenge the circuit court's interpretation of a statute regarding his sentence simply\r\nby pleading guilty. See Easter v. State, 355 S.C. 79, 81-82, 584 S.E.2d 117, 119\r\n(2003) (\"Sentencing, although often combined with the admission of guilt in a\r\nhearing, is a separate issue from guilt and a distinct phase of the criminal process.\r\nTherefore, when Easter entered his guilty plea but objected to his sentence he did\r\nnot enter an invalid, conditional guilty plea.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nThe State also argues Donahue waived his challenge when he told the circuit court\r\nhe was guilty of, and was pleading guilty to, \"burglary in the third degree second\r\noffense\" and that he understood he faced up to ten years in prison. We disagree\r\nwith this point as well. After Donahue's counsel presented to the circuit court the\r\nsame arguments he now makes on appeal, counsel made it clear, and the circuit\r\ncourt acknowledged it understood, that Donahue challenged the court's\r\ninterpretation of the statute and intended to appeal the ruling that he faced ten\r\nyears. Under the circumstances of this case, we find Donahue did not waive his\r\nright to challenge the circuit court's interpretation of subsection 16-11-313(B).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Zulfer, 345 S.C. 258, 547 S.E.2d 885 (Ct. App. 2001), this court faced a\r\nsimilar question under the statute defining burglary in the first degreeâ€”subsection\r\n16-11-311(A) of the South Carolina Code (2003). Subsection 16-11-311(A)(2)\r\nprovides that what would otherwise be a second-degree burglary is elevated to\r\nfirst-degree if \"the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or\r\nmore convictions for burglary . . . .\" See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(A)\r\n(2003) (defining second-degree burglary of a dwelling). We held that \"prior record\r\n. . . of convictions\" included out-of-state convictions:\r\n\n             Nowhere does the language of the statute limit a prior\r\n             record of convictions for burglary or housebreaking to\r\n             only those that occurred within South Carolina. In not so\r\n             limiting a prior record of convictions, the plain language\r\n             of our burglary statute permits an enhancement of the\r\n             offense based on a prior record of out-of-state\r\n             convictions for burglary . . . .\r\n\r\nZulfer, 345 S.C. at 262, 547 S.E.2d at 887.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, nothing in the language of subsection 16-11-313(B) limits a circuit court\r\nto considering only South Carolina offenses. Therefore, a circuit court must\r\nconsider an out-of-state burglary conviction in determining the sentencing range\r\nfor third-degree burglary.1 345 S.C. at 262-63, 547 S.E.2d at 887.\r\n\r\nDonahue attempts to distinguish Zulfer by arguing that the word \"offense\" in\r\nsubsection 16-11-313(B) has a different meaning than the word \"convictions\" in\r\nsubsection 16-11-311(A)(2). We find no basis for the distinction. In subsection\r\n16-11-311(A)(2), the legislature used the word convictions to refer to prior crimes,\r\nwhich would make a defendant eligible for sentence enhancement only if he had\r\nbeen convicted of the crime. In subsection 16-11-313(B), the legislature was\r\nreferring to the subsequent crimeâ€”a situation in which the legislature and our\r\ncourts typically use the term offense to describe a second or subsequent crime.\r\nThus, the legislature had a valid reason to use different terms for the same\r\npurposeâ€”enhancing a sentence based on prior convictions. See Zulfer, 345 S.C. at\r\n263, 547 S.E.2d at 887 (recognizing that a purpose of subsection 16-11-311 is to\r\npunish recidivism by imposing \"'a stiffened penalty for the latest crime'\" (quoting\r\nState v. Washington, 338 S.C. 392, 396, 526 S.E.2d 709, 711 (2000))). As we\r\nstated in Zulfer, \"had the legislature intended that a prior record of out-of-state\r\nconvictions for burglary . . . could not be used for purposes of enhancement, it\r\ncould easily have limited the statute to only South Carolina offenses.\" 345 S.C. at\r\n262-63, 547 S.E.2d at 887. We find the use of the word offense in subsection 16-\r\n11-313(B) does not indicate the intent to limit the circuit court to the use of South\r\nCarolina crimes for enhancement. Cf. State v. Breech, 308 S.C. 356, 358-59, 417\r\n\r\n1 Donahue argues on appeal that \"[a] burglary conviction in Georgia is not the\r\nsame as burglary third in South Carolina.\" However, because he did not present\r\nthis argument to the circuit court, it is not preserved for appellate review. State v.\r\nBickham, 381 S.C. 143, 147 n.2, 672 S.E.2d 105, 107 n.2 (2009).\r\n\nS.E.2d 873, 875 (1992) (finding statute that defined a prior offense as \"the\r\nviolation of any law or ordinance of this State or any municipality of this State\"\r\nlimited recidivism enhancement to offenders with previous convictions for\r\nviolations of South Carolina law), superseded by statute, Act No. 453, Â§ 14, 1992\r\nS.C. Acts 2402, as recognized in State v. Tennyson, 315 S.C. 471, 445 S.E.2d 630\r\n(1994).\r\n\r\nMoreover, Donahue's interpretation of subsection 16-11-313(B) would produce\r\nabsurd results. See State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 351, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010)\r\n(\"Courts will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so\r\nplainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the Legislature or would\r\ndefeat the plain legislative intention.\"). His definition of the word offense allows\r\nsentence enhancement under subsection 16-11-313(B) only when the defendant has\r\na prior South Carolina conviction for burglary in the third degree. Under his\r\ninterpretation, therefore, a prior South Carolina conviction for first-degree or\r\nsecond-degree burglary would not trigger the higher maximum sentence. Thus, a\r\ndefendant with a prior conviction for a more serious burglary would be exposed to\r\na lower maximum sentence than someone with a prior conviction for third-degree\r\nburglary. The result Donahue proposes is even more absurd because third-degree\r\nburglary is a lesser-included offense of first-degree and second-degree burglary.\r\nSee generally State v. Goldenbaum, 294 S.C. 455, 365 S.E.2d 731 (1988)\r\n(recognizing third-degree burglary as a lesser-included offense of first- and\r\nsecond-degree burglary where the facts support it). Therefore, a person previously\r\nconvicted of the greater offense would be subject to a lesser penalty, even though\r\nhis prior conviction actually constituted third-degree burglary.\r\n\r\nFinally, Donahue's interpretation would create an inconsistency between the first-\r\ndegree and third-degree burglary statutes, which were enacted contemporaneously.\r\nAct No. 159, Â§ 2, 1985 S.C. Acts 603, 604-06; see Higgins v.

The legislature could not have intended that an out-of-\r\nstate burglary conviction could be used to elevate a second-degree burglary to first-\r\ndegree burglary, thereby increasing the defendant's exposure from fifteen years to a\r\npossible life sentence,2 but could not be used to enhance a third-degree burglary\r\n\r\n2Compare S.C.

(\"Tantara\"), and Palmetto Health Alliance d/b/a Palmetto\r\nHealth Baptist (\"Palmetto Health\") (collectively, Respondents). On appeal,\r\nJohnson claims the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Palmetto\r\nHealth because Johnson presented evidence that Palmetto Health owed a duty to\r\nhim, thus creating a genuine issue of material fact for the jury. In addition,\r\nJohnson contends the circuit court erred in finding he was a statutory employee of\r\nTantara and thus barred from bringing suit against Tantara and Harpster by the\r\nexclusivity provisions of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act (the Act).\r\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 2007, Tantara contracted with Labor Ready, a temporary\r\nemployment agency, to use several of its workers, including Johnson, to load\r\ncomputers at Palmetto Health for subsequent delivery to HP Financial Services.\r\nTantara also employed Harpster, a licensed commercial truck driver, to load and\r\ntransport the computers. Palmetto Health contracted with HP Financial Services to\r\nremove the computers from its facility; however, it neither hired nor contracted\r\nwith Tantara, Harpster, or Johnson to pick up and transport the computers.\r\n\r\nHarpster's dispatch ticket listed two Palmetto Health contacts and indicated the\r\npick-up location did not have a loading dock, requiring Harpster to load the\r\ncomputers curbside. Accordingly, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Harpster parked his\r\ntractor-trailer adjacent to the Taylor Street curb in front of Palmetto Health's\r\nPhysicians Building, facing west near the intersection of Taylor and Sumter Streets\r\nin downtown Columbia, South Carolina. The Taylor Street curb was marked in\r\nyellow and was not identified as a loading zone by any official signage. Harpster\r\nplaced triangle warning signs around the tractor-trailer and activated the tractorÂ­\r\ntrailer's hazard lights during the four hours the truck was parked outside Palmetto\r\nHealth. Both Harpster and Johnson testified during their depositions that the\r\ntractor-trailer was not obstructing traffic.\r\n\r\nJohnson met Harpster at approximately 9:30 a.m. After receiving instructions on\r\nhow to package and load the computers, Johnson helped Harpster load the\r\n\ncomputers onto the tractor-trailer. At no point during this time was Johnson or\r\nHarpster required to cross the street to facilitate the loading process. As Johnson\r\nwas standing on the tractor-trailer's lift gate, Franklin Jackson (\"the Driver\")1\r\nstruck Johnson, Harpster, and the tractor-trailer with his vehicle as he was traveling\r\nwest on Taylor Street. Johnson suffered severe and permanent injuries.2 As a\r\nresult, Johnson filed suit against the Driver on February 28, 2008, alleging the\r\nDriver negligently struck Johnson with the Driver's motor vehicle while Johnson\r\nwas outside of Palmetto Health loading computers onto a tractor-trailer owned by\r\nTantara and operated by Harpster.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2009, Johnson filed an amended complaint, adding common-law\r\nnegligence claims against Respondents. As to Palmetto Health, Johnson alleged\r\nPalmetto Health was negligent in failing to provide him with a safe working place\r\nbecause it allowed Harpster to park and unload a tractor-trailer in a no-parking\r\narea. In response, Palmetto Health denied any liability and claimed it had no duty\r\nto Johnson and any of Johnson's injuries were not proximately caused by Palmetto\r\nHealth. As to Tantara and Harpster, Johnson claimed they were negligent in\r\nparking the tractor-trailer along a yellow curb in a no-parking area. In response,\r\nTantara and Harpster alleged Johnson was a statutory employee of Tantara at the\r\ntime of the accident, and therefore, jurisdiction over his claims was vested\r\nexclusively in the Workers' Compensation Commission.\r\n\r\nPrior to filing claims against Respondents, Johnson received lifetime workers'\r\ncompensation and social security benefits for his injuries and settled his claim\r\nagainst the Driver.\r\n\r\nOn July 7, 2010, Palmetto Health filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to\r\nRule 56, SCRCP. On July 27, 2010, Tantara and Harpster filed a motion to\r\ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n1 The Driver, an insulin-dependent diabetic, testified his insulin level dropped right\r\nbefore the accident, causing him to black out and lose control of his vehicle.\r\n2 As a result of the collision, Johnson suffered severe injuries, including a broken\r\njaw, broken left arm, torn ACL in his left knee, amputated right leg, internal\r\ninjuries, nerve damage, and head injuries. Johnson incurred over $1,000,000 in\r\nmedical bills and was declared permanently and totally disabled by the Social\r\nSecurity Administration.\r\n\nThe circuit court held a hearing on both motions on November 2, 2010. On\r\nNovember 30, 2010, the court issued an order granting summary judgment in favor\r\nof Palmetto Health. The circuit court concluded Palmetto Health owed no legal\r\nduty to Johnson because (1) Johnson was not on Palmetto Health's property when\r\nthe accident occurred; (2) there was no evidence of a relationship between\r\nPalmetto Health and Johnson; (3) Palmetto Health was not required by law to\r\nprovide a designated loading zone for pick-up and deliveries of goods; and (4) the\r\ntractor-trailer was legally parked pursuant to section 56-5-2530 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2006).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court also granted Tantara and Harpster's motion to dismiss pursuant to\r\nRule 12(b)(1), SCRCP. Citing to the framework set forth in Posey v. Proper Mold\r\n& Engineering, Inc., 378 S.C. 210, 661 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 2008), the court\r\nconcluded the activities performed by Johnson were important, necessary,\r\nessential, and integral to Tantara's business and were also performed by Tantara's\r\ndirect employees. Accordingly, Johnson was a statutory employee, and workers'\r\ncompensation was Johnson's exclusive remedy. Johnson filed a Rule 59(e),\r\nSCRCP, motion for reconsideration in response to both of these rulings, which the\r\ncircuit court denied. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nAs it pertains to Palmetto Health, when reviewing an order granting summary\r\njudgment, this court applies the same standard as the circuit court. Fleming v.\r\nRose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving\r\nparty must prevail as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining whether\r\nany triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\nnon-moving party. Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860. On appeal\r\nfrom an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all\r\nambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light\r\nmost favorable to the non-moving party. Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550\r\nS.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\n\r\nAs it pertains to Tantara and Harpster, the determination of whether a worker is a\r\nstatutory employee is jurisdictional and therefore the question on appeal is one of\r\nlaw. Edens v. Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 440, 597 S.E.2d 863, 867 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\nWhen deciding questions of law, such as this one, this court has the power and\r\nduty to review the entire record and decide the jurisdictional facts in accord with\r\nits view of the preponderance of the evidence. Poch v. Bayshore Concrete\r\nProds./S.C., Inc., 386 S.C. 13, 21, 686 S.E.2d 689, 693 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Existence of a Duty: Palmetto Health\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, Johnson only asserts a common-law negligence cause of action\r\nagainst Palmetto Health. In support of his claim, Johnson asserts Palmetto Health\r\nvoluntarily assumed a general duty to Johnson and other individuals who picked up\r\nand loaded computers at its business because it maintained primary control of the\r\nloading area, knowingly and frequently managed the pick-up process, and directed\r\nHarpster where to park the day of the accident. We agree and as set forth below,\r\nwe find whether Palmetto Health owed a duty to Johnson on the day in question\r\nwas a question of fact for the jury.\r\n\r\nTo succeed in a negligence cause of action, the plaintiff must establish (1) the\r\ndefendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached the duty\r\nby a negligent act or omission; (3) the defendant's breach was the actual and\r\nproximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury or\r\ndamages. Moore v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 220-21, 644 S.E.2d 740, 746 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2007). A crucial element in a cause of action for negligence is the existence\r\nof a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Burnett v. Family\r\nKingdom, Inc., 387 S.C. 183, 189, 691 S.E.2d 170, 173 (Ct. App. 2010). An\r\naffirmative legal duty may be created by statute, a contractual relationship, status,\r\nproperty interest, or some other special circumstance. Madison v. Babcock Ctr.,\r\nInc., 371 S.C. 123, 136, 638 S.E.2d 650, 656-57 (2006).\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina common law, there is no general duty to control the conduct\r\nof another or to warn a third person or potential victim of danger. Madison, 371\r\nS.C.at 136, 638 S.E.2d at 656. Absent a duty, there is no actionable negligence.\r\nBurnett, 387 S.C. at 189, 691 S.E.2d at 173. Our courts, however, have\r\nrecognized five exceptions to this rule: (1) where the defendant has a special\r\nrelationship to the victim; (2) where the defendant has a special relationship to the\r\ninjurer; (3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a duty; (4) where the\r\ndefendant negligently or intentionally creates the risk; and (5) where a statute\r\n\nimposes a duty on the defendant. Madison, 371 S.C.at 136, 638 S.E.2d at 656.\r\nMoreover, \"[u]nder common law, even where there is no duty to act but an act is\r\nvoluntarily undertaken, the actor assumes the duty to use due care.\" Russell v. City\r\nof Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991). The question of\r\nwhether a duty to act arises in a given case may depend on the existence of\r\nparticular facts. Vaughan v. Town of Lyman, 370 S.C. 436, 446, 635 S.E.2d 631,\r\n637 (2006). When there are factual issues regarding whether the defendant\r\nvoluntarily undertakes a duty, the existence of a duty becomes a mixed question of\r\nlaw and fact to be resolved by the fact finder. Id. at 446-47, 635 S.E.2d at 637.\r\n\r\nWe find a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Palmetto Health\r\nassumed a duty of due care to ensure Johnson's safety on the day of the accident,\r\ndespite Johnson's lack of contractual privity with Palmetto Health. Testimony was\r\npresented that Palmetto Health employees affirmatively instructed Harpster where\r\nto park and where to load the computers. Harpster testified that upon his arrival at\r\nPalmetto Health, he went inside Palmetto Health and spoke with a woman who\r\nwas listed as the contact for pick-up on his dispatch ticket. She instructed him\r\nwhere to park his tractor trailer. Upon exiting the building, Harpster stated the\r\nsecurity guards at Palmetto Health also instructed him where to park and indicated\r\nthat location was the common pick-up and drop-off parking zone for deliveries at\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nLinda Taylor, the manager of desktop services at Palmetto Health, stated in her\r\ndeposition that while she was one of the contacts on the dispatch ticket, she never\r\ntells the transportation companies where to park; rather, she tells them where the\r\ngoods are located on Palmetto Health's premises. When questioned, she stated\r\nPalmetto Health has not changed their loading and unloading policies since the\r\naccident, and to her knowledge, deliveries were still being made at that location.\r\nHarpster's statement that he was instructed to park in the same location over a year\r\nafter the accident affirms this testimony.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find conflicting testimony was presented about\r\nwhether Palmetto Health assumed the responsibility of instructing individuals to\r\npark in this location, thereby creating a duty to ensure their safety. See Miller v.\r\nCity of Camden, 329 S.C. 310, 314, 494 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1997) (\"Where there are\r\nfactual issues regarding whether the defendant was in fact a volunteer, the\r\nexistence of a duty becomes a mixed question of law and fact to be resolved by the\r\nfact-finder.\"). Because summary judgment should be denied if more than one\r\n\ninference can be drawn from the evidence, we reverse the circuit court's grant of\r\nsummary judgment to Palmetto Health on this ground.\r\n\r\nII.   Tort Immunity: Tantara & Harpster\r\n\r\nNext, Johnson argues the circuit court erred in granting tort immunity to Tantara\r\nand Harpster on Johnson's negligence claim because Johnson was not Tantara's\r\nstatutory employee, its permanent employee, or its borrowed employee. We\r\ndisagree and address each argument in turn.\r\n\r\na. Statutory Employee\r\n\r\nThe Act is the exclusive remedy against an employer for an employee's work-\r\nrelated accident or injury. Fuller v. Blanchard, 358 S.C. 536, 540, 595 S.E.2d 831,\r\n833 (2004). The exclusivity provision of the Act precludes an employee from\r\nmaintaining a tort action against an employer where the employee sustains a work-\r\nrelated injury. Tatum v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 346 S.C. 194, 201, 552 S.E.2d 18, 22\r\n(2001). \"The exclusive remedy doctrine was enacted to balance the relative ease\r\nwith which the employee can recover under the Act: the employee gets swift, sure\r\ncompensation, and the employer receives immunity from tort actions by the\r\nemployee.\" Poch, 386 S.C. at 22, 686 S.E.2d at 694.\r\n\r\nCoverage under the Act is typically dependent on the existence of an employer-\r\nemployee relationship. Edens, 359 S.C. at 442, 597 S.E.2d at 868. However, there\r\nare certain statutory exceptions to this general rule. Id. One of these exceptions is\r\nfound in section 42-1-400 of the Act, which, under some circumstances, imposes\r\nliability on an employer or business owner for the payment of compensation\r\nbenefits to a worker not directly employed by the employer. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n42-1-400 (1976); see also Poch, 386 S.C. at 24, 686 S.E.2d at 695 (\"The concept\r\nof statutory employment is designed to protect the employee by assuring\r\nworkmen's compensation coverage by either the subcontractor, the general\r\ncontractor, or the owner if the work is a part of the owner's business.\") (internal\r\ncitation omitted).\r\n\r\nThe Act specifically provides that statutory employees are included within the\r\nscope of the Act:\r\n\n              When any person, in this section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 and\r\n              42-1-430 referred to as \"owner,\" undertakes to perform\r\n              or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business\r\n              or occupation and contracts with any other person (in this\r\n              section and Â§Â§ 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 referred to as\r\n              \"subcontractor\") for the execution or performance by or\r\n              under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the\r\n              work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable\r\n              to pay to any workman employed in the work any\r\n              compensation under this Title which he would have been\r\n              liable to pay if the workman had been immediately\r\n              employed by him.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 42-1-400.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a worker is a statutory employee, our courts consider the\r\nfollowing three factors: \"(1) whether the activity is an important part of the trade or\r\nbusiness, (2) whether the activity is a necessary, essential and integral part of the\r\nbusiness, and (3) whether the identical activity in question has been performed by\r\nemployees of the principal employer.\" Poch, 386 S.C. at 25, 686 S.E.2d at 695\r\n(internal citation omitted). If the activity at issue meets even one of these three\r\ncriteria, the worker qualifies as the statutory employee of the owner. Edens, 359\r\nS.C. at 443, 597 S.E.2d at 868.\r\n\r\nA review of prior South Carolina decisions demonstrates that no single bright-line\r\ntest exists to determine whether an individual qualifies as a statutory employee.\r\nMeyer v. Piggly Wiggly No. 24, Inc., 331 S.C. 261, 265, 500 S.E.2d 190, 192 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998). \"Each situation, therefore, must be evaluated on a case-by-case\r\nbasis.\" Id.\r\n\r\nTantara is a full-service transportation company that specializes in shipping high-\r\nvalue technological equipment. The primary services Tantara provides include:\r\npackaging goods for transport, loading goods onto its truck, transporting the goods,\r\nand unloading the goods at the desired destination. Tantara employs drivers who\r\nperform all of these functions, and when large transportation jobs exist, additional\r\ntemporary workers are hired to assist the drivers with the packaging and loading\r\naspect of the job.\r\n\nAlthough Tantara was not Johnson's direct employer, we find Johnson was\r\nperforming work for Tantara that would render him a statutory employee under the\r\nthree tests espoused above at the time of the accident. First, packaging and loading\r\ntechnology equipment were an important part of Tantara's business. Because an\r\nintegral part of Tantara's transportation business is agreeing to package and load\r\ngoods, without these services, Tantara's financial profitability and customer base\r\nwould undoubtedly diminish. To negate this factor, Johnson highlights the fact\r\nthat Harpster has a commercial driver's license, which enables him to transport the\r\nequipment to its final destination, whereas, Johnson does not. While we agree with\r\nJohnson that transporting the goods is an important part of Tantara's business, this\r\nfact does not negate the importance and necessity of packaging and loading\r\nequipment, an undisputed prerequisite to the transportation component of Tantara's\r\nbusiness. Last, Johnson performed the same tasks that Harpster performed.\r\nDuring Johnson's deposition, he testified he assisted Harpster with packaging the\r\ncomputers and loading them onto the tractor-trailer. When asked whether he\r\nrecalled doing anything specific that Harpster did not do, Johnson replied, \"No, he\r\ndid just about everything.\" Therefore, we find all three tests are met in the present\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nJohnson cites to several cases in support of his argument that an activity must be\r\nthe \"main function and basic operation\" of the business, not merely essential or\r\nnecessary, for statutory employment to exist. However, we find each of these\r\ncases distinguishable from the present situation because in those cases, the basic\r\noperation of the putative employer differed greatly from the activity in which the\r\nplaintiff was engaged at the time of injury. See Meyer, 331 S.C. at 267, 500 S.E.2d\r\nat 193 (finding grocery store was not statutory employer of deliveryman for\r\nwholesale bakery because although baked goods were sold at grocery store, the\r\nsale and delivery of baked goods was not essential to operating the grocery store\r\nand relationship was only that of a vendor and vendee); Abbott v. The Limited, Inc.,\r\n338 S.C. 161, 163-64, 526 S.E.2d 513, 514 (2000) (finding driver/deliveryman for\r\ncommon carrier was not a statutory employee of retail clothing company because\r\nalthough receiving clothing was an important part of retailer's business, the\r\ntransportation of the goods was not a part or process of the business); Glass v. Dow\r\nChem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, 202, 482 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1997) (finding welders who\r\nwere contracted to replace the faÃ§ade of a building were not statutory employers of\r\nchemical company because specialized nature of repairs were not part of chemical\r\ncompany's basic operation). In those cases, transportation was not a main and\r\nintegral part of the defendant's business for purposes of the Act. Here, Tantara's\r\n\nbusiness is transportation of technological equipment, which necessarily includes\r\npackaging, loading, and unloading that equipment. Accordingly, we affirm the\r\ncircuit court's legal determination that Tantara is entitled to tort immunity as\r\nJohnson's statutory employer.\r\n\r\nb. Casual Employee\r\n\r\nNext, Johnson claims he was a casual employee; thus, the exclusivity provisions of\r\nthe Act do not apply. We disagree.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act,\r\n\r\n             \"[E]mployee\" means every person engaged in an\r\n             employment under any appointment, contract of hire, or\r\n             apprenticeship, expressed or implied, oral or written,\r\n             including aliens and also including minors, whether\r\n             lawfully or unlawfully employed, but excludes a person\r\n             whose employment is both casual and not in the course\r\n             of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of his\r\n             employer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). When employment\r\ncannot be characterized as permanent or periodically regular, but occurs by chance,\r\nor with the intent and understanding of both employer and employee that it shall\r\nnot be continuous, it is casual. Hernandez-Zuniga v. Tickle, 374 S.C. 235, 248,\r\n647 S.E.2d 691, 697-98 (Ct. App. 2007). We agree with Johnson that his\r\nemployment with Tantara on August 10, 2007 was casual, in the sense that it was\r\nneither permanent nor continuous, but this does not end the inquiry. As required\r\nby section 42-1-130, his employment must be both casual and not in the course of\r\nthe trade, business, profession, or occupation of Tantara. See Carrier v. Westvaco\r\nCorp., 806 F. Supp. 1242, 1246-47 (D.S.C. 1992) (finding work performed by\r\nplaintiff was part of the trade, business, profession or occupation of defendant, so it\r\nwas unnecessary to consider whether plaintiff's employment was casual \"since for\r\nan employee to be excluded under the [A]ct, his employment must be both casual\r\nand not in the trade, business, profession or occupation of his employer\"). As\r\nstated above, Johnson's work the day of his accident was in the course of Tantara's\r\nbusiness; thus, we find Johnson was not a casual employee of Tantara as\r\ncontemplated by section 42-1-130.\r\n\nc. Borrowed Employee\r\n\r\nLast, Johnson claims this court should employ the common-law borrowed\r\nemployee test, which would establish that Tantara was not Johnson's special\r\nemployer. We disagree, but because we find Tantara is Johnson's statutory\r\nemployer, we need not address this argument. See Poch, 386 S.C. at 26, 686\r\nS.E.2d at 696 (declining to address borrowed employee argument after finding\r\ndefendant was plaintiff's statutory employer and entitled to workers' compensation\r\nimmunity under that theory).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to Tantara\r\nand Harpster and reverse the grant of summary judgment as to Palmetto Health.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5053","title":"State v.

Gilliland appeals his conviction for first-degree\r\nburglary. He argues the trial court erred in declining to direct a verdict of acquittal\r\nor, in the alternative, by refusing to give a jury charge on trespass as a lesser\r\nincluded offense of burglary. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nI.    Background\r\nGilliland and Pamela Morgan (Victim) met as co-workers. After they dated for a\r\nfew months, Gilliland moved in with Victim. Following an incident in January\r\n2010, Victim ended the relationship. Gilliland departed from the home, leaving his\r\npersonal property behind. On February 16, 2010, the family court issued an order\r\nof protection forbidding Gilliland \"to communicate or attempt to communicate\r\nwith [Victim] in any way or to enter or attempt to enter [her] place of residence\"\r\nfor a period of six months.1\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 2010, Victim worked until 11:00 p.m. Arriving home at 12:10 a.m.\r\non March 16, 2010, she unlocked her door, entered, and found Gilliland waiting for\r\nher inside. According to Victim, Gilliland told her he had come to talk and make\r\nup with her; he loved her; and he, not the family court, knew what was best for her.\r\nWhen Victim asked how he had entered her home, Gilliland would only say, \"I'm a\r\ncat burglar. Doors can be jimmied, windows can be opened.\" According to\r\nVictim, she did not run because she did not believe she could get away, and she did\r\nnot tell him to leave because she believed he would not listen to her.\r\n\r\nWhen Victim tried to leave by taking her dog for a walk, Gilliland followed closely\r\nbehind her. Back inside the house, Victim tried to dial 911 from her two home\r\nphones, but they had been disconnected. After more than two hours of alternately\r\nsitting and walking from room to room while Gilliland talked, Victim succeeded in\r\ngoing into the bathroom alone, where she dialed 911 from her cell phone. Police\r\nofficers arrived soon afterward, interviewed Gilliland and Victim separately, and\r\narrested Gilliland. He was charged with violation of a protective order and first-\r\ndegree burglary.\r\n\r\nII.   Trial\r\n\r\nAt trial, Gilliland admitted to violating the protective order. However, he defended\r\nagainst the burglary charge by claiming he was present at the home with Victim's\r\nconsent. According to Gilliland, Victim invited him to the home to collect his\r\nbelongings and personally let him inside.\r\n\r\n1The family court issued the order of protection pursuant to the Protection from\r\nDomestic Abuse Act (the Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-4-10 to -395 (1985 & Supp.\r\n2011).\r\n\nDeputy Ryan Flood recalled responding to Victim's domestic disturbance call at\r\napproximately 3:00 a.m. When Victim answered the deputy's knock at the back\r\ndoor, she quivered and appeared frightened. The officer interviewed Victim and\r\nGilliland separately and took a statement from Victim. He recalled transcribing\r\nher account because she was shaking too much to write it herself. Next, Deputy\r\nFlood Mirandized and interviewed Gilliland, who explained he intended to\r\nreconcile with Victim and had entered the house through the bathroom window.2\r\nGilliland did not mention any invitation to retrieve his belongings.\r\n\r\nVictim also testified at trial. She recalled obtaining the order of protection but\r\nsubsequently telephoning Gilliland's son. In that call, she offered to allow a\r\nmember of Gilliland's family to retrieve his belongings from her home. However,\r\nthe son handed the telephone to Gilliland, so Victim relayed the message to him.\r\nShe denied inviting Gilliland to her home. Although no one ever collected his\r\nbelongings, Gilliland continued to telephone Victim and send her love letters.\r\n\r\nGilliland testified in his defense. He acknowledged knowing the protective order\r\nbarred him from contacting Victim, but he stated he \"just loved her so much that\r\n[he] wanted to write her a letter.\" According to him, Victim telephoned his son\r\nseveral times in one day, asked for Gilliland, and invited him to come to her house\r\n\"after she got off work\" to pick up his belongings.\r\n\r\nGilliland recalled that, on the night of the incident, he walked eight miles to\r\nVictim's home, and Victim let him in. According to Gilliland, after Victim drank a\r\nglass of wine, the couple walked her dog, then went into the bedroom and made\r\nlove. Gilliland stated he showered afterward, then Victim went into the bathroom\r\non the pretense of showering and, while in the bathroom, called 911. He described\r\nVictim returning to the living room, kissing him, lighting a cigarette, and finishing\r\nher wine. Gilliland testified Victim asked if he would like to walk the dog with her\r\nagain, and he said yes. However, when she opened the door and stepped outside,\r\n\"the deputy was standing there.\"\r\n\r\nGilliland recollected waiting in the patrol car while the deputy talked with Victim,\r\nthen explaining to the officer that Victim had let him into her house when he\r\nknocked on the door. According to Gilliland, he told the officer he had gone to the\r\nhouse to reconcile with Victim and retrieve his belongings.\r\n\r\n\r\n2Victim also testified the latch to her bathroom window had been tampered with or\r\nbroken.\r\n\nWhen shown photographs of the damage to Victim's bathroom window, Gilliland\r\ndenied causing it. On cross-examination, he noted he knew when Victim would be\r\nworking and when she would likely return home. He admitted writing her several\r\nletters in April, May, June, July, August, September, and October 2010. He\r\nconfirmed writing in another letter, dated just two weeks before the incident, that\r\nhe understood the family court \"think[s] they know how to protect you, but they\r\ndon't. I must concentrate on what's good for us, and not what's right for the\r\nsystem.\" Although Gilliland claimed he received one letter in return from Victim,\r\nhe did not produce it.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the State's case, Gilliland moved for a directed verdict, arguing the\r\nState had failed to prove the elements of first-degree burglary. The trial court\r\ndenied his motion. At the close of testimony, he renewed his motion, which the\r\ntrial court again denied. In addition, anticipating the State intended to assert his\r\nviolation of the protective order satisfied the \"intent to commit a crime\" element of\r\nfirst-degree burglary, Gilliland requested a jury instruction on trespass as a lesser\r\nincluded offense. The trial court also denied this motion.\r\n\r\nThe jury found Gilliland guilty of both offenses, and he received concurrent\r\nsentences totaling fifteen years' imprisonment. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound\r\nby the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous. State v. Wilson,\r\n345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Directed Verdict\r\nGilliland asserts the trial court erred in declining to direct a verdict of acquittal on\r\nthe first-degree burglary charge when the only evidence supporting the element of\r\nintent to commit a crime was his violation of a protective order. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA court interpreting a statute looks first to the statute's plain language:\r\n\r\n             The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain\r\n             and effectuate the intent of the legislature. All rules of\r\n             statutory construction are subservient to the one that the\r\n             legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably\r\n\n            discovered in the language used, and that language must\r\n            be construed in light of the intended purpose of the\r\n            statute. Absent an ambiguity, the court will look to the\r\n            plain meaning of the words used to determine their\r\n            effect.\r\n\r\nState v. Whitner, Op. No. 27142 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jul. 11, 2012) (Shearouse Adv.\r\nSh. No. 23 at 46, 49) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviews the denial of a directed verdict by viewing the evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to\r\nthe State. State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). \"If\r\nthere is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\ntending to prove the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court] must find the case\r\nwas properly submitted to the jury.\" Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648. The trial\r\ncourt may not consider the weight of the evidence. Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nHowever, \"when the [circumstantial] evidence presented merely raises a suspicion\r\nof guilt,\" the trial court should direct a verdict in favor of the accused. State v.\r\nBostick, 392 S.C. 134, 142, 708 S.E.2d 774, 778 (2011) (citing State v. Cherry, 361\r\nS.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004)). A mere suspicion is a belief that is\r\ninspired by \"facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.\" State v. Lollis,\r\n343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).\r\n\r\nA person is guilty of first-degree burglary if he \"enters a dwelling without consent\r\nand with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling\" and either enters or remains in\r\nthe dwelling during the nighttime. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) (2003).\r\nAlthough the intent to commit a crime must exist at the time the accused enters the\r\ndwelling, the jury may base its determination of that intent upon evidence of the\r\naccused's actions once inside the dwelling. State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349-\r\n50, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527-28 (2000). First-degree burglary is a felony punishable by\r\nimprisonment of a term between fifteen years and life. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-\r\n311(B) (2003).\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 16-25-20(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011):\r\n\r\n            A person who violates the terms and conditions of an\r\n            order of protection issued in this State under . . . [the Act]\r\n            . . . is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction,\r\n            must be imprisoned not more than thirty days and fined\r\n            not more than five hundred dollars.\r\n\nFor the purposes of section 16-25-20(D), an order of protection is one that is\r\n\"issued to protect the petitioner or minor household members from the abuse of\r\nanother household member where the respondent has received notice of the\r\nproceedings and has had an opportunity to be heard.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(f)\r\n(Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nWe see no error. Our standard of review requires that we view the evidence in the\r\nrecord in the light most favorable to the State. Weston, 367 S.C. at 292, 625 S.E.2d\r\nat 648. In the case at bar, that evidence reflects Gilliland entered Victim's home\r\nagainst her wishes at some point before 12:10 a.m. and remained there for nearly\r\nthree nighttime hours. Accordingly, the State established Gilliland (1) entered\r\nVictim's dwelling (2) without her consent and (3) remained there during the\r\nnighttime. See Â§ 16-11-311(A) (setting forth elements of first-degree burglary).\r\n\r\nThus, the issue on appeal centers on the accused's intent to commit a crime within\r\nthe dwelling, which the State contends it established through Gilliland's violation\r\nof the order of protection. See id.; see also Â§ 16-25-20(D) (providing violation of a\r\nprotective order issued under the Act is a misdemeanor). The question whether the\r\nviolation of such an order is a crime sufficient to support first-degree burglary is\r\nnovel in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nWe find the plain language of sections 16-11-311(A) and 16-25-20(D) is\r\nunambiguous. Accordingly, we may not impose a different interpretation on that\r\nlanguage. See Whitner, Op. No. 27142 at 49 (holding a court must look to the\r\nplain meaning of unambiguous statutory language). First-degree burglary requires\r\nthat, at the time the offender entered the dwelling, he intended to commit a crime\r\nonce inside. Â§ 16-11-311(A). Violating the terms and conditions of an order of\r\nprotection is a crime. See Â§ 16-25-20(D) (\"A person who violates the terms and\r\nconditions of an order of protection issued . . . under . . . [the Act] . . . is guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor.\"). Gilliland argues unpersuasively that the good intentions with\r\nwhich he unlawfully entered Victim's home prevented his entry from rising to the\r\nlevel of a burglary; therefore, he is entitled to a directed verdict. Under his\r\ninterpretation, section 16-25-20(D) would criminalize only abusive\r\ncommunications with the victim. Although an extensive search of our case law\r\nrevealed a paucity of burglaries committed with benevolent intent, we find the\r\nplain language of sections 16-25-20(D) and 16-11-311(A) makes no allowance for\r\ngood intentions. Neither statute purports to exclude a misdemeanor under section\r\n16-25-20(D) from supporting a conviction of first-degree burglary. Neither statute\r\nrequires a particular mental state for the violation of a protective order to become a\r\ncriminal act. Neither statute establishes any exceptions or identifies violations that\r\n\nare not of a criminal nature. Accordingly, neither the trial court nor this court has\r\nthe authority to impose such a limitation or exception.\r\n\r\nEven ignoring the fact Gilliland violated the protective order by breaking into\r\nVictim's home, ample direct and circumstantial evidence existed from which the\r\njury could conclude he intended to commit a crime once inside. See Weston, 367\r\nS.C. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648 (requiring an appellate court to find a case was\r\nproperly submitted to the jury upon the presence in the record of \"any direct\r\nevidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\nthe guilt of the accused\"). The order of protection forbade Gilliland \"to\r\ncommunicate or attempt to communicate with [Victim] in any way or to enter or\r\nattempt to enter [her] place of residence.\" Deputy Flood, Victim, and Gilliland\r\nhimself testified he went to the home with the intent of talking to Victim.\r\nMoreover, Gilliland repeatedly admitted knowing the protective order barred him\r\nfrom communicating or attempting to communicate with Victim \"in any way\" or\r\nentering or attempting to enter her home. In spite of the protective order, he\r\nentered Victim's home and talked to her for hours. Consequently, sufficient\r\nevidence existed for this question to be submitted to the jury, and the trial court did\r\nnot err in declining to direct a verdict in Gilliland's favor.\r\n\r\nII.   Jury Instruction\r\nGilliland also asserts the trial court erred by refusing a jury instruction on the\r\ncharge of trespass as a lesser included offense of first-degree burglary. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, \"the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of\r\nSouth Carolina.\" Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472\r\n(2004). To warrant reversal, a trial court's refusal to give a requested jury\r\ninstruction \"must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.\" State v.\r\nBrown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004). The evidence\r\npresented at trial determines the law to be charged to the jury. Id. at 261-62, 607\r\nS.E.2d at 95.\r\n\r\n\"A trial [court] is required to charge a jury on a lesser included offense if there is\r\nevidence from which it could be inferred that a defendant committed the lesser\r\noffense rather than the greater.\" State v. Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 32, 340 S.E.2d 784,\r\n785 (1986). The test for determining whether one offense is a lesser included\r\noffense of another \"is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the\r\nelements of the lesser offense. If the lesser offense includes an element not\r\n\nincluded in the greater offense, then the lesser offense is not included in the\r\ngreater.\" Hope v. State, 328 S.C. 78, 81, 492 S.E.2d 76, 78 (1997) (quoting State\r\nv. Bland, 318 S.C. 315, 317, 457 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1995)).\r\n\r\nFinding Gilliland has failed to demonstrate error, we affirm. Absent error, we need\r\nnot look for prejudice. See Brown, 362 S.C. at 262, 607 S.E.2d at 95 (requiring\r\nboth error and prejudice for reversal of a trial court's refusal to give a requested\r\njury instruction).\r\n\r\nIn determining trespass is not a lesser included offense of first-degree burglary, the\r\ntrial court correctly relied on State v. Cross, 323 S.C. 41, 448 S.E.2d 569 (Ct. App.\r\n1994), which is on point and has never been overruled. In that case, the victim's\r\nformer boyfriend entered her home twice, sexually assaulted her at knifepoint\r\nonce, took some of her belongings, and forced her to accompany him to Myrtle\r\nBeach. Id. at 43, 448 S.E.2d at 569-70. Although the jury acquitted the defendant\r\nof several other charges, it found him guilty of two counts of first-degree burglary.\r\nId. at 43, 448 S.E.2d at 569. The court of appeals affirmed. Id. at 44-45, 448\r\nS.E.2d at 570. Gilliland contends our opinion in that case is inapplicable here\r\nbecause the State failed to prove all elements of trespass in Cross. However, the\r\nCross court did not base its determinations concerning the relationship between\r\ntrespass and burglary on the facts presented at Cross's trial. Id. Instead, it found\r\nneither statutory trespass nor common law criminal trespass was a lesser included\r\noffense of first-degree burglary, because each type of trespass requires the State to\r\nprove at least one element not present in first-degree burglary. Id. at 44, 448\r\nS.E.2d at 570. Because the Cross court based its conclusion upon a properly\r\nconducted comparison of the elements of each offense and did not limit its holding\r\nto the facts of the case before it, the trial court in this matter did not err in relying\r\non Cross.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the plain language of sections 16-25-20(D) and 16-11-311(A) is\r\nunambiguous and sets forth no exception, exclusion, or requirement precluding an\r\nintent to violate an order of protection from qualifying, for the purposes of first-\r\ndegree burglary, as an intent to commit a crime. Therefore, we affirm the trial\r\ncourt's denial of Gilliland's motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find the trial court properly applied the elements test and this court's\r\nopinion in Cross when it determined trespass was not a lesser included offense of\r\n\nfirst-degree burglary. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in declining to charge\r\nthe jury on trespass.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5054","title":"Thalia S. v.

Johnson, Jr., Warren Paul Johnson, and Mills\r\nL. Morrison, Jr., all of Law Office of Darrell Thomas\r\nJohnson, Jr., LLC, of Hardeeville, for Appellants.\r\n\r\nJohn Robert Murphy, of Murphy & Grantland, PA, of\r\nColumbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nCURETON, A.J.: In this dispute over insurance coverage, Appellants argue the\r\ntrial court erred in granting summary judgment to Progressive Select Insurance\r\nCompany (Progressive) because (1) their insurance policy affords bodily injury\r\nliability coverage pursuant to section 56-9-351 of the South Carolina Code (2006)\r\nand (2) the trial court's reliance on Newton v. Progressive Northwestern Insurance\r\nCompany, 347 S.C. 271, 554 S.E.2d 437 (Ct. App. 2001), is misplaced. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe facts of this case are undisputed. On March 22, 2005, Kristopher Gromacki\r\nwas driving his wife, Mercedes Salas, and children, Thalia and Angelina, from\r\ntheir home in Florida to Virginia. On Interstate 95 in South Carolina, Gromacki\r\nlost control of the vehicle, swerved into another lane, and was rear-ended by a\r\ntractor trailer operated by Fleet Source, Inc. Gromacki and Thalia were seen by a\r\ndoctor the day of the accident and were released the same day. However, Salas\r\nsuffered a brain injury that required emergency surgery, and Angelina passed away\r\na few days after the accident.\r\n\r\nThalia and Salas sued Fleet Source, Gromacki, and the corporation that\r\nmanufactured Angelina's child seat and ultimately settled with the two corporate\r\ndefendants. The claims against Gromacki were referred to a special referee, who\r\nawarded damages to Thalia and Salas. Thereafter, Appellants filed a declaratory\r\njudgment action against Progressive, which is the basis for this appeal. In the\r\ncomplaint, Appellants alleged Progressive breached the policy of insurance by\r\nrefusing to pay the limits of liability coverage under the policy. Appellants argued\r\nthe policy should be enforced to include bodily injury liability coverage because\r\nthe policy's out-of-state coverage provision requires coverage for accidents that\r\noccur in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nProgressive served Appellants with a request for admission. Appellants admitted\r\nthe policy was issued to Salas, a resident of Florida and the named insured under\r\nthe policy. They further admitted the policy was neither issued nor delivered in\r\nSouth Carolina; the vehicle involved in the accident was principally garaged in\r\nFlorida, not South Carolina; and on the date of the accident, Appellants were not\r\nresidents of South Carolina. Appellants acknowledged the policy did not include\r\nany bodily injury liability coverage for accidents occurring in Florida. Moreover,\r\nthey admitted Progressive did not certify proof of financial responsibility pursuant\r\nto South Carolina law on behalf of Appellants and Gromacki and Salas were not\r\nrequired to certify proof of financial responsibility prior to the accident.\r\nAppellants confirmed Gromacki and Salas had not been involved in a prior\r\n\naccident in South Carolina before the accident relating to this dispute, nor had their\r\ndriving privileges in South Carolina been suspended at the time of the accident.\r\nFinally, Appellants admitted they had no evidence either Gromacki or Salas had\r\nfailed to satisfy a judgment relating to another motor vehicle accident prior to the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nBoth sides moved for summary judgment. After a hearing, the trial court held the\r\nout-of-state coverage provision in the policy was not triggered and granted\r\nsummary judgment to Progressive. Appellants filed a motion to alter or amend the\r\njudgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which the trial court denied. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Procedural Posture\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, an appellate court\r\n\"applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\"\r\nBoyd v. Bellsouth Tel. Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410, 415, 633 S.E.2d 136, 138 (2006).\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Englert, Inc. v.\r\nLeafGuard USA, Inc., 377 S.C. 129, 134, 659 S.E.2d 496, 498 (2008). In\r\ndetermining whether any triable issues of fact exist, a court must view the evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642,\r\n648 (2006).\r\n\r\n\"The construction and enforcement of an unambiguous contract is a question of\r\nlaw for the court, and thus can be properly disposed of at summary judgment.\"\r\nHansen ex rel. Hansen v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 350 S.C. 62, 67, 565 S.E.2d\r\n114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Middleborough Horizontal Prop. Regime\r\nCouncil of Co-Owners v. Montedison S.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 477, 465 S.E.2d 765,\r\n770 (Ct. App. 1995)).\r\n\r\nII.   Analysis\r\nFirst, Appellants argue their insurance policy must afford bodily injury liability\r\ncoverage because section 56-9-351 of the South Carolina Code (2006) requires\r\n\nnonresident motorists to maintain bodily injury liability coverage while driving in\r\nSouth Carolina. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"An insurance policy is a contract between the insured and the insurance company,\r\nand the terms of the policy are to be construed according to contract law.\" 1 Auto\r\nOwners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 606, 663 S.E.2d 484, 487 (2008);\r\naccord Barnier v. Rainey, 890 So. 2d 357, 359 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004) (\"In that\r\nthe rights and obligations of parties under a policy of insurance arise out of a\r\ncontract of insurance, they are governed by contract law.\"). \"Where the terms of a\r\ncontract are clear and unambiguous, its construction is for the court; but where the\r\nterms are ambiguous, the question of the parties' intent must be submitted to the\r\njury.\" Hansen, 350 S.C. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 116; accord Ellenwood v. S. United\r\nLife Ins. Co., 373 So. 2d 392, 394 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1979) (\"If the language of a\r\ncontract is unambiguous and not subject to conflicting inferences, its construction\r\nis for the court, not the jury.\"). Furthermore, \"[w]hen a statute's terms are clear and\r\nunambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court\r\nmust apply the statute according to its literal meaning.\" Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of\r\nPhysical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606 (2006).\r\n\r\nAppellants base their argument upon language contained in the second paragraph\r\nof the out-of-state provision in the policy:\r\n\r\n             If an accident to which this Part 1 applies occurs in any\r\n             state, territory or possession of the United States of\r\n             America or any province or territory of Canada other\r\n             than the one in which a covered vehicle is principally\r\n\r\n1 We are cognizant that \"[a]ll contracts of insurance on property, lives, or interests\r\nin this State are considered to be made in the State and . . . are subject to the laws\r\nof this State.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-61-10 (2002). However, in construing a\r\ncontract made between residents of another state, executed and delivered in the\r\nother state, and concerning lives or property usually located in the other state,\r\nSouth Carolina courts will look to the law of the state where the contract was\r\nissued. Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of Cal., 342 S.C. 152, 155-56, 536 S.E.2d 376,\r\n378 (Ct. App. 2000). The question of which state's laws apply to Appellants'\r\ncontract is not at issue in this appeal. Both Florida and South Carolina adhere to\r\nthe same applicable principles; therefore, we provide citations to the law of both\r\nstates.\r\n\n            garaged, and the state, province, territory or possession\r\n            has:\r\n\r\n            ....\r\n\r\n            2. A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a\r\n            non-resident to maintain insurance whenever the\r\n            nonresident uses a vehicle in that state, province,\r\n            territory or possession, this policy will provide the\r\n            greater of:\r\n\r\n            a. the required minimum amounts and types of coverage;\r\n            or\r\n\r\n            b. the limits of Liability under this policy.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). According to Appellants, section 56-9-351 qualifies as a\r\n\"similar law\" for the purposes of Paragraph 2. That statute, entitled \"Deposit of\r\nsecurity by owner following accident; suspension of license and registration and\r\nnotice thereof,\" provides:\r\n\r\n            Within sixty days of receipt of a report of a motor vehicle\r\n            accident within this State which has resulted in bodily\r\n            injury or death or damage to the property of any one\r\n            person in the amount of two hundred dollars or more, the\r\n            Department of Motor Vehicles shall suspend the license\r\n            of each operator or driver if he is the owner of the motor\r\n            vehicle involved in the accident and all registrations of\r\n            each owner of a motor vehicle involved in the accident.\r\n            If the operator or driver is a nonresident, the privilege of\r\n            operating a motor vehicle within this State and the\r\n            privilege of the use within this State of a motor vehicle\r\n            owned by him is suspended unless the operator, driver or\r\n            owner, or both, deposits security in a sum not less than\r\n            two hundred dollars or an additional amount as the\r\n            department may specify that will be sufficient to satisfy a\r\n            judgment that may be recovered for damages resulting\r\n            from the accident which may be recovered against the\r\n            operator or owner. Notice of the suspension must be sent\r\n            by the department to the operator and owner at least ten\r\n\n             days before the effective date of the suspension and shall\r\n             state the amount required as security.\r\n\r\nThe plain language of this statute does not mandate that nonresident motorists\r\nmaintain bodily injury liability coverage while driving in South Carolina. Section\r\n56-9-351 does not operate against a nonresident motorist unless and until he causes\r\n\"a motor vehicle accident within this State which . . . result[s] in bodily injury or\r\ndeath or damage to the property of any one person in the amount of two hundred\r\ndollars or more.\" After such an accident, the law requires either the suspension of\r\nthe motorist's privilege to operate a motor vehicle in South Carolina or a deposit of\r\nfunds sufficient to pay the damages resulting from the accident. We find these\r\nrequirements are designed to protect the interests of the victims and prevent further\r\naccidents, not to punish the nonresident motorist.2 Moreover, because these\r\nrequirements do not apply to a nonresident motorist who has not caused an\r\naccident resulting in bodily injury, death, or property damage in excess of two\r\nhundred dollars, we find section 56-9-351 does not mandate that nonresident\r\nmotorists maintain bodily injury liability coverage while driving in this state.\r\n\r\nIn view of these findings, we conclude section 56-9-351 is not a \"compulsory\r\ninsurance or similar law\" under Paragraph 2 of the out-of-state coverage provision\r\nin Appellants' insurance policy. Consequently, the trial court did not err in\r\ndetermining Progressive was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nSecond, Appellants argue the trial court erred in relying on Newton because section\r\n56-9-351 expressly requires nonresident motorists to carry bodily injury liability\r\ncoverage. In view of our determination that section 56-9-351 does not impose\r\nsuch a requirement, we need not reach this issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\nof Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an\r\nappellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior\r\nissue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 As this court previously observed, the purpose of section 56-9-351 is to \"compel\r\nthe creation of a fund from which one might satisfy a judgment obtained against an\r\noperator or owner for damages resulting from a motor vehicle accident involving\r\nthe operator's or owner's motor vehicle.\" Newton v. Progressive Northwestern Ins.\r\nCo., 347 S.C. 271, 275, 554 S.E.2d 437, 439 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWith regard to whether section 56-9-351 triggered the out-of-state coverage\r\nprovision in Appellant's insurance policy, we find section 56-9-351 does not\r\noperate as a \"compulsory insurance or similar law.\" Therefore, we find the out-of-\r\nstate coverage provision was not triggered, and the trial court did not err in\r\ndetermining Progressive was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nBecause our decision concerning Appellants' first issue is dispositive of this\r\nappeal, we do not reach Appellants' remaining issue. Accordingly, the decision of\r\nthe trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5055","title":"Rivera v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nJeisel and Edgar are siblings. On the night of the accident, Edgar received a\r\ntelephone call indicating their father had been mugged and was injured. Edgar\r\ntried to conceal the call from his sister to avoid upsetting her, but Jeisel overheard\r\nand insisted on accompanying Edgar to check on their father. Edgar was eighteen\r\nyears old, but was not a licensed driver. They got into a car owned by an\r\nacquaintance and were followed by a second car driven by a friend, Miguel\r\nFernandez.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the events were unfolding at the Rivera residence, Warren\r\nNewton and his brother were preparing to move a heavy piece of logging\r\nequipment across a T-intersection at Pennyroyal Road in Georgetown County,\r\nSouth Carolina. Warren waited ten minutes for traffic to clear. Using a tractor\r\ntrailer, he pulled straight across, blocking both lanes of the road and beginning to\r\nmake a three-point turn. He was backing up to straighten the vehicle as Edgar and\r\nhis companions approached. Edgar did not see the trailer in time to stop, and a\r\ncollision occurred. Jeisel was ejected from the vehicle and suffered significant\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nJeisel sued the Newton defendants and her brother. At trial, Jeisel testified she\r\ninsisted that her brother take her to check on their father, and she did not think he\r\ncould have done anything to avoid the accident. She also testified she was trying\r\nto reach her mother on her cell phone while they were driving, and she did not see\r\nthe truck in time to warn Edgar. Edgar testified he may have been going slightly\r\nover the fifty-five miles-per-hour speed limit, and he did not see any warning signs\r\nabout trucks entering the road as he approached the tractor trailer. He also testified\r\nhe was familiar with this road and had driven on it before.\r\n\r\nThomas Onions testified as an expert in the plaintiff's case. In his opinion, the\r\nheadlights of the tractor trailer made it appear as though a car was coming down\r\nthe road. He testified the lights would have temporarily blinded Edgar, and he\r\nwould not have been able to see the trailer in time to avoid the accident. Onions\r\n\nstated the Newton brothers could have set up flares or reflective triangles to warn\r\noncoming traffic of their presence, and they created a very dangerous condition in\r\nmaking this maneuver at night on a poorly lit road. He also stated Edgar may have\r\nbeen traveling faster than fifty-five miles per hour, but it was impossible to tell\r\nfrom the information provided. At the conclusion of Onions' testimony, the\r\nNewton defendants' attorney read into the record the summation portion of Onions'\r\nreport, which stated:\r\n\r\n             It's my opinion that the careless and negligent manner in\r\n             which Warren, Warren Newton, undertook to move his\r\n             truck and trailer across the roadway on the night of the\r\n             accident was the most significant causal factor to the\r\n             crash event. It is further my opinion that Edgar Rivera\r\n             also contributed to this accident by failing to slow his\r\n             vehicle appropriately and continuing to drive into an area\r\n             visually obstructed by nighttime glare and poor lighting.\r\n\r\nTrooper William Surratt responded to the accident scene and testified that\r\naccording to his diagram of the scene, the tractor trailer's headlights would have\r\nbeen shining in the direction of oncoming traffic. He also stated he did not see\r\nwarning signs on the road approaching the accident, and no skid marks were at the\r\nscene. Surratt testified Edgar did not have his driver's license at the scene.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Jeisel's case, Edgar moved for a directed verdict based on\r\nJeisel's alleged failure to produce any evidence of his negligence. The court\r\nconcluded Edgar had testified he was speeding, and he did not see the tractor trailer\r\nor warning signs, which could have indicated he had failed to keep a proper\r\nlookout. The trial court denied the motion.\r\n\r\nWarren Newton testified the tractor trailer had reflective tape on the side and\r\nbetween the tractor and the trailer, there were more than fifty lights, six of which\r\nwere blinking at the time of the accident. He stated the truck headlights were\r\nangled away from the road, facing into the woods, when Edgar approached. He\r\nindicated he saw the cars approaching and estimated their speed at sixty-five to\r\nseventy miles per hour. Warren testified he flashed his lights, but the cars never\r\nslowed down. He further stated there were reflective signs approaching the\r\nintersection indicating trucks entered the highway. Warren acknowledged he and\r\nhis brother did not use flashlights or reflective triangles that were available to them\r\n\nto signal oncoming traffic, and they could have waited until morning to move the\r\ntruck, an activity he estimated caused them to block the roadway for approximately\r\ntwenty-five to thirty seconds. Joel Newton testified he was following the tractor\r\ntrailer in a pick-up truck and had his headlights and emergency flashers on. He\r\ntestified the tractor trailer's headlights were pointing toward the woods.\r\n\r\nTimothy Ward, a witness who lived nearby and approached the scene soon after\r\nthe accident happened, testified the headlights of the truck were pointed into the\r\nwoods at about a forty-five-degree angle to the road. He further testified a couple\r\nof cars approached from both directions, but they were able to stop and turn\r\naround. Ward did not remember seeing lights on the trailer.\r\n\r\nCharles Dickinson, an expert for the Newton defendants, opined that Edgar should\r\nhave seen the tractor trailer if he had been paying attention and not speeding at the\r\ntime of the accident. According to Dickinson, there was sufficient time, based on\r\nhis information and his attempt to recreate the conditions the night the accident\r\noccurred, for Edgar to see the truck's headlights, readjust his vision, and stop the\r\ncar before hitting the trailer.\r\n\r\nThe parties made several motions before the jury was charged. Jeisel moved to\r\nstrike the Newton defendants' contributory negligence defense. The trial court\r\ngranted this motion. The trial court also granted Jeisel's request not to charge the\r\njury with unavoidable accident. However, over Jeisel's objection, the trial court\r\nallowed the verdict form to go to the jury with the option to find in favor of both\r\ndefendants. The trial court found that even though Jeisel was not contributorily\r\nnegligent and the accident was not unavoidable, the jury could find she did not\r\nmeet her burden of proof in proving one or both defendants were negligent.\r\n\r\nThe jury deliberated and returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. The trial\r\ncourt granted Jeisel's new trial motion, stating, \"The only reasonable inference\r\nfrom the evidence presented at the trial of this case is that one or more of the\r\ndefendants were at fault in causing the accident that injured the plaintiff.\" The\r\ncourt further concluded: \"[N]o evidence was presented that showed the plaintiff at\r\nfault. Therefore, I find and conclude that the court erred in not granting the\r\nplaintiff's motion for directed verdict as to liability and in instructing the jury that it\r\ncould return a verdict in favor of all defendants. See Howard v. Roberson, 376\r\nS.C. 143, 654 S.E.2d 877 [(Ct. App. 2007)].\" Edgar and the Newton defendants\r\nappealed.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.   Jeisel's Alleged Negligence\r\n\r\nThe Newton defendants argue numerous alleged errors regarding Jeisel's own\r\nnegligence, which we combine to address. The Newton defendants argue the trial\r\ncourt erred in the following: (1) granting a new trial because the jury could have\r\nimputed Edgar's negligence to Jeisel by virtue of her being the older and only\r\nlicensed occupant of the vehicle; (2) excluding evidence of Jeisel's failure to keep a\r\nproper lookout; (3) failing to charge the jury that a passenger has a duty to exercise\r\ndue care for his or her own safety; and (4) granting a new trial when Jeisel's own\r\nnegligence contributed to her injuries. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506,\r\n509 (2005). The trial court is required to charge only principles of law that apply\r\nto the issues raised in the pleadings and developed by the evidence at trial. Clark\r\nv. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000). \"Furthermore, the trial\r\ncourt is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.\" Id.\r\n(citation omitted).\r\n\r\nThe Newton defendants contend numerous facts could have led the jury to infer\r\nJeisel was negligent. For instance, the Newton defendants argue a reasonable\r\ninference arises that Jeisel was not wearing her seatbelt because she was ejected\r\nthrough the windshield of the car. Also, they argue an inference of her negligence\r\ncould have been made based on her decision to ride with Edgar, an unlicensed\r\ndriver. Additionally, the fact that Jeisel was trying to reach her mother on her cell\r\nphone could have inferred Jeisel was negligent as a passenger. Finally, the Newton\r\ndefendants argue the jury could have imputed Edgar's negligence to Jeisel.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Newton defendants failed to preserve their argument that the trial court\r\nerred in granting a new trial because the jury could have imputed Edgar's\r\nnegligence to Jeisel by failing to raise this issue to the trial court. See Herron v.\r\nCentury BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 466, 719 S.E.2d 640, 642 (2011) (stating an\r\nappellant's argument must be sufficiently clear to allow the trial court to\r\nunderstand it and rule upon it).\r\n\nAs to the remainder of their arguments regarding Jeisel's own negligence, we find\r\nno error. First, no evidence was presented of Jeisel's negligence. Although the\r\nissue of a plaintiff's own comparative negligence is ordinarily a question of fact for\r\nthe jury, where the evidence presented yields only one conclusion concerning\r\nliability, the trial court may determine the issue as a matter of law. Bloom v.\r\nRavoira, 339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2000) (explaining comparative\r\nnegligence is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury); Fairchild v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nTransp., 385 S.C. 344, 353, 683 S.E.2d 818, 823 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"When evidence\r\npresented at trial yields only one conclusion concerning liability, the trial court\r\nmay properly grant a motion for directed verdict.\"), aff'd, 398 S.C. 90, 727 S.E.2d\r\n407 (2012).\r\n\r\nAs to the inferential evidence of Jeisel's failure to wear a seatbelt, a violation of the\r\nmandatory seatbelt law \"is not negligence per se or contributory negligence, and is\r\nnot admissible as evidence in a civil action.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-6540(C)\r\n(Supp. 2011); see Clark v. Cantrell, 332 S.C. 433, 451, 504 S.E.2d 605, 614-15\r\n(Ct. App. 1998) (holding indirect evidence that plaintiff/decedent was not wearing\r\na seatbelt was not inadmissible, but the court correctly instructed the jury it should\r\nnot consider the seatbelt evidence in its deliberations), aff'd as modified by 339\r\nS.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000); Keaton v. Pearson, 292 S.C. 579, 580, 358\r\nS.E.2d 141, 141 (1987) (holding that in the absence of an affirmative statutory\r\nduty, the failure to use a seat belt does not constitute contributory negligence).\r\nFurther, we find Jeisel's actions as a passenger are not, as a matter of law,\r\nsufficient to reverse the trial court's grant of a new trial. See Thompson v. Michael,\r\n315 S.C. at 271, 433 S.E.2d at 854 (\"In the absence of any fact or circumstance\r\nindicating the driver is incompetent or careless, an occupant of a vehicle is not\r\nrequired to anticipate negligence on the part of the driver.\"); Funderburk v. Powell,\r\n181 S.C. 412, 421, 187 S.E. 742, 749 (1936) (\"The standard of care to be observed\r\nand exercised by the occupant is of course ordinary care under the circumstances.\r\nIt cannot be said, however, that in every case and under all circumstances it is the\r\nduty of an occupant of a motor vehicle to use his senses in order to discover\r\napproaching vehicles or other dangers, or that his failure to do so would be\r\nnegligence.\").\r\n\r\nAfter a review of the record, we find no error in the trial court's rulings regarding\r\nJeisel's own negligence.\r\n\nII. Denial of Directed Verdict in Favor of Edgar\r\n\r\nEdgar argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict. We\r\ndisagree. The evidence suggested that either Edgar, the Newton defendants, or\r\nboth were negligent. Edgar admitted he was speeding, and the evidence illustrates\r\nhe was potentially distracted by concern about his father's well-being. Although\r\nJeisel testified she did not know how her brother could have avoided the accident,\r\nher expert indicated Edgar's speed and failure to slow down when confronted with\r\nglare contributed to the accident. Finally, the Newton defendants' expert testified\r\nthe accident was due to Edgar's speed and failure to keep a proper lookout, and\r\nWarren Newton testified he estimated Edgar's speed between sixty-five and\r\nseventy miles per hour.\r\n\r\nIn considering a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to \"view the\r\nevidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light\r\nmost favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the motions where\r\neither the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.\"\r\nStrange v. S.C. Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445\r\nS.E.2d 439, 440 (1994) (citation omitted). The trial court should not be concerned\r\nwith the credibility or weight of evidence, only with its existence or nonexistence.\r\nN. Am. Rescue Prods., Inc. v. Richardson, 396 S.C. 124, 131, 720 S.E.2d 53, 57\r\n(Ct. App. 2011). An appellate court reviewing a trial judge's denial of a motion for\r\ndirected verdict will reverse only when no evidence exists to support the ruling or\r\nwhen the ruling is governed by an error of law. Austin v. Stokesâ€“Craven Holding\r\nCorp., 387 S.C. 22, 42, 691 S.E.2d 135, 145 (2010).\r\n\r\nIn this case, there was evidence Edgar was speeding. Viewing the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to Jeisel, we find no error in the trial court's denial of Edgar's\r\nmotion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nIII.   Grant of Jeisel's New Trial Motion\r\n\r\nEdgar and the Newton defendants argue the trial court erred in granting Jeisel's\r\nmotion for new trial. The Newton defendants also argue the trial court erred in\r\nfinding the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was that one\r\nor more of the defendants were at fault. The Newton defendants finally argue\r\nJeisel failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing any of the defendants were\r\nnegligent. We disagree.\r\n\nWe previously discussed the evidence of Edgar's negligence in affirming the trial\r\ncourt's denial of his motion for directed verdict. We also find there was evidence\r\nthe Newton defendants were negligent. The Newton defendants had to wait ten\r\nminutes before traffic cleared before maneuvering the tractor trailer diagonally\r\nacross the road, completely blocking both lanes and preventing traffic from\r\nproceeding in either lane. Furthermore, Jeisel's expert testified the Newton\r\ndefendants caused a dangerous condition by moving the equipment late at night\r\nwith the knowledge that their presence in the intersection would be approximately\r\ntwenty-five to thirty seconds. They did not use a flagman or flashlight to warn\r\noncoming traffic or put out reflective triangles, which were available to them. We\r\nfind no error by the trial court in granting the motion for a new trial.\r\n\r\nEdgar additionally argues the trial court erred in granting the new trial because the\r\ncourt based its decision on its failure to grant Jeisel's directed verdict motion as to\r\nliability. He contends the new trial motion was made on the law, not the facts as\r\ncontemplated by the thirteenth juror doctrine. We need not determine if the court\r\nerred in concluding it should have granted Jeisel's motion for directed verdict as to\r\nliability, because we find it was based on the facts, and it was within the trial\r\ncourt's discretion.\r\n\r\n\"The grant or denial of a new trial motion rests within the trial court's discretion,\r\nand its decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court's findings are\r\nwholly unsupported by the evidence or its conclusions are controlled by error of\r\nlaw.\" Winters v. Fiddie, 394 S.C. 629, 638, 716 S.E.2d 316, 321 (Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(citations omitted). \"In South Carolina, a trial judge may grant a new trial\r\nfollowing a jury verdict under the Thirteenth Juror doctrine. The doctrine entitles\r\nthe judge to sit, in essence, as the thirteenth juror when he finds the evidence does\r\nnot justify the verdict, and then to grant a new trial based solely upon the facts.\"\r\nLane v. Gilbert Constr. Co., 383 S.C. 590, 597, 681 S.E.2d 879, 883 (2009)\r\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This court's review of a trial\r\ncourt's grant of a new trial is limited to consideration of whether evidence exists to\r\nsupport the trial court's order. Id. As long as there is conflicting evidence, the trial\r\ncourt's grant of a new trial will not be disturbed. Id. at 597-98, 681 S.E.2d at 883.\r\n\r\nUnder the thirteenth juror doctrine, the trial court may grant a new trial based on its\r\nview of the facts. Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990).\r\nOur supreme court discussed the thirteenth juror doctrine in Folkens:\r\n\n             This Court has had an opportunity to reconsider the\r\n             thirteenth juror doctrine on several occasions. Each time\r\n             we have refused to abolish the doctrine. We have also\r\n             refused to require trial judges to explain the reasons for\r\n             the ruling. The thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by\r\n             which the trial court may grant a new trial absolute when\r\n             he finds that the evidence does not justify the verdict.\r\n             This ruling has also been termed granting a new trial\r\n             upon the facts. The effect is the same as if the jury failed\r\n             to reach a verdict. The judge as the thirteenth juror\r\n             \"hangs\" the jury. When a jury fails to reach a verdict, a\r\n             new trial is ordered. Neither judge nor the jury is\r\n             required to give reasons for this outcome. Similarly,\r\n             because the result of the \"thirteenth juror\" vote by the\r\n             judge is a new trial rather than an adjustment to the\r\n             verdict, no purpose would be served by requiring the trial\r\n             judge to make factual findings.\r\n\r\nId. (internal citation omitted).\r\n\r\nAt this stage of a trial, the court may weigh the evidence even though it is not\r\npermitted to do so in considering a directed verdict motion. See Buxton v.\r\nThompson Dental Co., 307 S.C. 523, 528, 415 S.E.2d 844, 848 (Ct. App. 1992)\r\n(affirming the trial court's grant of a new trial motion after its denial of a directed\r\nverdict motion), overruled on other grounds by Boone v. Goodwin, 314 S.C. 374,\r\n444 S.E.2d 524 (1994). \"The granting of a new trial upon the facts is not the\r\nequivalent of granting a directed verdict.\" McEntire v. Mooregard Exterminating\r\nServs., Inc., 353 S.C. 629, 632, 578 S.E.2d 746, 748 (Ct. App. 2003) (citation\r\nomitted). We find the trial court's refusal to grant a directed verdict was not\r\nnecessarily inconsistent with the grant of a new trial. See RFT Mgmt. Co., L.L.C.\r\nv. Tinsley & Adams L.L.P., 399 S.C. 322, 334, __ S.E.2d __ (2012) (\"The question\r\nof whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict, a question of law,\r\nis distinguishable from the question of whether a fair preponderance of the\r\nevidence supports a verdict, which is a matter involving the exercise of\r\ndiscretion.\").\r\n\nWe find the trial court's grant of a new trial was based on its view of the facts,\r\nevidenced in its finding that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was\r\n\"that one or more of the defendants were at fault in causing the accident that\r\ninjured the plaintiff.\" The court also found no evidence showed Jeisel was at fault.\r\nFurthermore, we need not address whether the trial court erred in finding it should\r\nhave granted Jeisel's motion for a directed verdict because we find the trial court\r\ngranted the new trial on the facts, and its decision was not wholly unsupported by\r\nthe evidence. See Trivelas v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 552, 593 S.E.2d\r\n504, 508 (Ct. App. 2004) (affirming the grant of a new trial under the thirteenth\r\njuror doctrine after viewing the trial court's order as a whole, coupled with the\r\ncourt's statements); Burton v. York Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 358 S.C. 339, 355-56, 594\r\nS.E.2d 888, 897 (Ct. App. 2004) (reading the trial court's order as a whole in\r\nfinding the reasons for the court's order were \"amply clear\"); Youmans ex rel.\r\nElmore v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 380 S.C. 263, 272, 670 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App.\r\n2008) (\"When an order granting a new trial is before this Court, our review is\r\nlimited to the consideration of whether evidence exists to support the trial court's\r\norder.\").\r\n\r\nWe likewise find no error in the trial court's citation to Howard v. Roberson, 376\r\nS.C. 143, 147-48, 654 S.E.2d 877, 879 (Ct. App. 2007), in which this court\r\naffirmed the trial court's grant of a motion for directed verdict in favor of a\r\npassenger against two drivers. This court stated: \"The evidence presented at trial\r\nyielded only one conclusionâ€”that the negligence of at least one driver, if not both,\r\nresulted in the accident causing [the plaintiff's] injuries.\" Id. at 151, 656 S.E.2d at\r\n881. In this case, we need not determine if the trial court erred in finding it should\r\nhave granted Jeisel directed verdict because the learned judge did not err in\r\ngranting a new trial based on the facts. Therefore, we find no prejudicial error in\r\nits citation to Howard.\r\n\r\nFinally, without citation to legal authority in his initial brief, Edgar argues there\r\nwas sufficient evidence of the negligence of an unnamed party such as the State of\r\nSouth Carolina or Georgetown County to support the jury's verdict. This issue is\r\ndeemed abandoned. See State v. Howard, 384 S.C. 212, 217, 682 S.E.2d 42, 45\r\n(Ct. App. 2009) (finding an issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered\r\non appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authority); see\r\nalso McClurg v. Deaton, 395 S.C. 85, 87 n.2, 716 S.E.2d 887, 888 n.2 (2011)\r\n(stating an issue may not be raised for the first time in a reply brief).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court's order granting a new trial is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: I agree with the\r\nmajority's analysis in sections I and II. However, I must respectfully dissent as to\r\nthe trial court's grant of Jiesel's new trial motion. The trial court granted a new\r\ntrial based on its failure to direct a verdict in Jiesel's favor as to the liability of one\r\nor both defendants. Because this was the basis of the order, as evidenced by its\r\nlanguage and reliance on Howard v. Roberson, 376 S.C. 143, 654 S.E.2d 877 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2007), I believe the analysis as to whether the denial of directed verdict was\r\nappropriate is essential to the new trial question.\r\n\r\nOn that point, I believe the trial court correctly denied Jeisel's motion, because the\r\njury could have found she failed to meet her burden of proof as to the negligence\r\nof both defendants. Jeisel testified she did not believe Edgar could have done\r\nanything to avoid the accident, and the parties presented conflicting testimony\r\nregarding the direction the tractor-trailer's headlights were shining and how well\r\nthe truck and area were lit the night of the accident. See Moore v. Levitre, 294 S.C.\r\n453, 453-54, 365 S.E.2d 730, 730 (1988) (stating in deciding a directed verdict\r\nmotion, the trial court must view the evidence and its inferences in the light most\r\nfavorable to the opposing party and should deny the motion if the evidence yields\r\nmore than one inference or if its inferences are in doubt).\r\n\r\nBecause I believe the trial court's grant of a new trial was based on an erroneous\r\nchange of heart with respect to the directed verdict motion, I would reverse the trial\r\ncourt's grant of a new trial and reinstate the jury's verdict.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5056","title":"Park Regency v.

Appellants contend the\r\ntrial court erred in (1) not considering the company's legal obligation to repay debts\r\n\nto its remaining members and other relevant and undisputed evidence when\r\nvaluing R&D's distributional interest and (2) treating R&D's liability to the other\r\nmembers as an offset to the fair value of its distributional interest instead of\r\nentering a judgment against the dissociated member. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nCrossroads Retail, LLC (Crossroads) was formed for the purpose of developing a\r\ntract of land in Fort Mill (the Property), which initially consisted of 29.84 acres.\r\nAfter the relationships between members of Crossroads broke down, Park\r\nRegency, LLC (Park Regency); Landy Properties, LLC (Landy Properties); and\r\nSowers Properties, LLC (Sowers Properties) (collectively, Appellants) filed this\r\naction to dissociate R&D from Crossroads. Appellants joined Hawkensen\r\nConstruction, Inc. (Hawkensen) and Carl's Construction, Inc. (Carl's) as\r\ndefendants.\r\n\r\nHawkensen, R&D, and Carl's (collectively, Respondents) were owned, at least in\r\npart, by Carl Hawkensen.1 Hawkensen was an incorporated construction company.\r\nR&D was an LLC, in which Carl Hawkensen owned an 85% interest and Chad\r\nWhitmire owned the remaining 15%. Originally incorporated in 1990, Carl's was\r\nadministratively dissolved in 1997. However, after the dissolution, Carl\r\nHawkensen continued to operate Carl's as a sole proprietorship.\r\n\r\nI.    Acquisition of the Property\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Hawkensen deposited $75,000 in earnest money on a contract to purchase\r\nthe Property for $2,957,600. After Hawkensen failed to secure adequate funding,\r\nthe seller enlisted the assistance of Eric Sowers, a mortgage broker. Sowers\r\nreferred Carl Hawkensen to Roger Gaines of Park Regency, a company that had\r\nrecently sold some investment property and was seeking new investment property\r\nfor a section 1031 exchange.2 On July 25, 2006, the three reduced a preliminary\r\n\r\n1In an effort to differentiate the individual from the companies that bear his name,\r\nwe refer to Carl Hawkensen by his first and last names.\r\n2Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code permits a taxpayer to exchange,\r\nwithin a prescribed period of time, property held for investment for other property\r\nof like kind without recognizing any gain or loss in value for tax purposes. 26\r\nU.S.C.A. Â§ 1031(a)(1) (2011).\r\n\nacquisition and development agreement to writing. Later, Gaines introduced Carl\r\nHawkensen to Steven Landy of Landy Properties, another investor. Ultimately,\r\nPark Regency agreed to provide as much as $800,000 toward the purchase of the\r\nProperty, and Landy Properties provided $201,100 in additional funds. Park\r\nRegency took out a loan in the amount of $1,922,440 to cover the remainder of the\r\npurchase price.\r\n\r\nOn September 27, 2006, Park Regency, Hawkensen, R&D, Sowers, and Landy\r\nexecuted a written contract (the Crossroads Commons Agreement) memorializing\r\ntheir intent to purchase and develop the Property. The Crossroads Commons\r\nAgreement established a sequence of events affecting the obligations and\r\nownership interests of the parties. Park Regency agreed to accept title to the\r\nProperty pending R&D's completion of its obligations and to transfer title as\r\ndescribed below. Hawkensen and R&D agreed to assign Hawkensen's rights under\r\nthe purchase contract to Park Regency, establish an account \"insuring\r\nHawkensen['s] . . . performance,\" pay the interest and carrying charges on loans\r\nused to develop the Property, and maintain at least $80,000 in an escrow account\r\nfor that purpose. Furthermore, R&D agreed it would \"[i]mmediately commence\r\nand complete at cost the first phase of clearing and grading of the Property in a\r\ngood and workmanlike manner\" in compliance with a previously established\r\nbudget.3 Hawkensen agreed to ensure R&D complied with its obligations.\r\n\r\nAll parties agreed that, upon R&D's fulfillment of its obligations, the remaining\r\nmembers of the group would receive their ownership interests in the Property:\r\nR&D would receive a 47.5% interest, Sowers would receive a 5% interest for\r\nproviding \"professional services,\" and Landy Properties would receive a 10%\r\ninterest for supplying funds for the purchase of the Property. On October 6, 2006,\r\nPark Regency acquired title to the Property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Although referenced as \"Exhibit B\" in the Crossroads Commons Agreement, this\r\nbudget does not appear in the record and appears to have been misplaced prior to\r\nlitigation. However, a budget introduced without objection at trial indicates the\r\nbudgeted amount was $596,700.\r\n\nII.   Formation of Crossroads\r\n\r\n      A.     Agreement among Tenants in Common\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2007, Park Regency, R&D, Landy Properties, and Sowers\r\nProperties (collectively, the Tenants) executed an Agreement among Tenants in\r\nCommon (the TIC Agreement). The TIC Agreement recognized that the Tenants\r\nalready owned the Property in the proportions identified in the Crossroads\r\nCommons Agreement: Park Regency owned 37.5%, R&D owned 47.5%, Landy\r\nProperties owned 10%, and Sowers Properties owned 5%. The TIC Agreement\r\nstates the Tenants, as owners of the Property:\r\n\r\n             [D]esire by this Agreement to set forth and confirm their\r\n             mutual agreements and understandings with respect to\r\n             their ownership interests in the Property, their respective\r\n             rights and obligations as tenants in common of the\r\n             Property, and their right to manage, rent, operate,\r\n             maintain, alter, improve, lease, transfer, sell or otherwise\r\n             control the disposition of the property or any part thereof.\r\n\r\nThe TIC Agreement acknowledged mutual ownership of the Property and\r\nestablished each Tenant's rights and obligations, including requirements\r\nconcerning a Tenant's withdrawal from the group.\r\n\r\nFollowing the appointment of a property manager, the Tenants anticipated\r\nquarterly disbursements of any monies received that exceeded the Property's\r\noperating costs. They established an order for these disbursements. First, Park\r\nRegency and then Landy Properties would receive payments up to the amounts\r\nthey had invested. Next, Hawkensen, in its capacity as Horizontal Developer,\r\nwould receive payments for \"its unpaid hard costs including costs prior to closing\r\nsuch as initial contract deposit, engineering, surveying, etc.\" Finally, the Tenants\r\nwould receive payments corresponding to their proportionate shares.\r\n\r\nIn the event revenues from the Property and the Tenants' reserves were insufficient\r\nto pay taxes, loan payments, or other operating costs, the Tenants agreed to\r\ncontribute the necessary funds in accordance with their proportionate shares.\r\nAlthough any Tenant's failure to contribute would be an event of default, two\r\nprovisions specifically addressed R&D's participation. First, in the event of R&D's\r\nuncured default for failure to contribute, the other Tenants could purchase R&D's\r\n\ninterest in the Property for 75% of its fair market value, \"reduced further by any\r\npayment outstanding by R&D.\" Second, R&D agreed to maintain $250,000 in an\r\nescrow account for the purpose of paying \"all interest and other carrying charges\"\r\non the loan or loans encumbering the Property. R&D's failure to do so would be an\r\nevent of default.\r\n\r\nParagraph 11 of the TIC Agreement addressed transfers of Tenants' interests, with\r\nsubsection (c) outlining events of default. In the event of a Tenant's default, the\r\nremaining Tenants would have the option (1) to cure using funds from the\r\ndefaulting Tenant's distributions or (2) to purchase the defaulting Tenant's interest\r\nin the Property. Paragraph 11(c)(ii) described the method for determining the\r\npurchase price of a defaulting Tenant's interest. After an independent appraiser\r\ndetermined the fair market value of the Property, the parties would determine the\r\nvalue of the dissociating Tenant's distributional interest by calculating the\r\ndifference between (1) the fair market value of the Property, multiplied by the\r\ndefaulting Tenant's proportionate share; and (2) all outstanding financial\r\nobligations as of the date of closing, multiplied by the defaulting Tenant's\r\nproportionate share. Paragraph 10(a) defined the specific obligations as taxes and\r\n\"maintenance expenses required by [Hawkensen] or any property manager and\r\napproved by [a 51% majority vote of the Tenants].\" The remaining Tenants would\r\nthen pay the dissociating Tenant 75% of the value of its distributional interest, less\r\nany amounts the dissociating Tenant owed.\r\n\r\nThe Tenants agreed any closing resulting from an event of default and conducted\r\npursuant to the TIC Agreement would take place \"within two hundred seventy\r\n(270) days from the date of notice of the Event of Default.\" However, they could\r\nextend the closing date \"by any period necessary to determine the purchase price\"\r\nof the defaulting Tenant's interest. Payment to the defaulting Tenant would be \"in\r\ncash at closing.\"\r\n\r\n      B.     Transfers of Ownership\r\n\r\nOne week after executing the TIC Agreement, Park Regency conveyed the\r\nProperty via quit-claim deed to the Tenants, as contemplated in the Crossroads\r\nCommons Agreement.4 In May 2008, the Tenants sold approximately fifteen acres\r\n\r\n4 Accordingly, Park Regency received an ownership interest of 37.5%, R&D\r\nreceived 47.5%, Landy Properties received 10%, and Sowers Properties received\r\n5%.\r\n\nof the Property to a third party for $750,000.5 The Tenants used the proceeds from\r\nthat sale to pay down the loan on the Property. In addition, they formed\r\nCrossroads, with each Tenant receiving a share of ownership in the LLC equal to\r\nits proportionate share of the Property under the TIC Agreement. They did not\r\nexecute an operating agreement. On May 30, 2008, the Tenants executed a quit-\r\nclaim deed conveying their remaining interest in the Property to Crossroads. In\r\ndoing so, the Tenants retained the same percentages of ownership in Crossroads,\r\nand therefore in the unsold portion of the Property, that they had held in the\r\nProperty itself.\r\n\r\nIII.   Financial Disputes\r\n\r\nHawkensen established a budget of $596,700 to complete the initial work on the\r\nProperty. Having completed most of this work between June and November 2007,\r\nHawkensen submitted payment applications for its work in September 2007,\r\nDecember 2007, and May 2008. The Tenants approved these payment\r\napplications, which totaled $581,199.02. The Tenants paid Hawkensen\r\n$424,481.32 directly, made interest payments totaling $76,717.70 on Hawkensen's\r\nbehalf, and deposited $80,000 into an escrow account on Hawkensen's behalf.6\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2007, Whitmire, on behalf of R&D, sent the Tenants an email\r\nrequesting payment of $216,540 for \"equipment costs\" Hawkensen owed to its\r\nsister company, Carl's.7 Upon determining the charges were not reimbursable as\r\n\"expenses incurred from an outside source,\" the Tenants declined to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 According to Gaines, the sold portion was later developed into apartments known\r\nas Crossroads Commons. Hawkensen performed some site preparation work for\r\nthose apartments. At the time of trial, Crossroads Commons, LLC, Phase 1, and\r\nCrossroads Commons, LLC, Phase 2, in which the Tenants were minority\r\nmembers, owned the apartment site.\r\n6The interest and escrow payments appear to satisfy Hawkensen's obligations\r\nunder the Crossroads Commons Agreement.\r\n7 At his deposition, Carl Hawkensen testified Carl's was a rental company that\r\nprovided heavy equipment for site work at the Property. Whitmire testified at trial\r\nthat he prepared the emailed bill to cover the cost of using Carl Hawkensen's\r\nequipment.\r\n\nAfter ownership of the Property transferred to Crossroads, R&D made monthly\r\ninterest payments on the bank loan until July 2009, at which point it notified the\r\nother Tenants it would make no further payments. The other Tenants began\r\nmaking the interest payments, which totaled $146,200.\r\n\r\nIV.   Litigation and Dissociation\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 2009, Appellants filed the instant action against Respondents,\r\nwho answered and counterclaimed. The case was tried on September 27 and 28,\r\n2010.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Gaines testified he believed the TIC Agreement governed dissociation of a\r\nmember of Crossroads. He anticipated Crossroads' debts to its members would be\r\ndeducted from the company's value prior to any division of assets or liability, but\r\nhe was unable to point to authority in the TIC Agreement and conceded\r\nCrossroads' debts to its members had not been memorialized in written notes.\r\nFurthermore, Gaines stated Appellants desired an award of damages for breach of\r\ncontract. However, he agreed any award of damages should be \"set off against any\r\ndistributional interest that the Court may determine should be paid to R&D.\"\r\n\r\nDoug Gentile, the certified public accountant for Crossroads, recalled the Tenants'\r\npreparations to sell a portion of the Property. He testified the Tenants asked him\r\nwhether the conveyance of their ownership interests in the Property from the\r\ntenancy in common to Crossroads would create a taxable event. After consulting\r\nwith tax counsel, Gentile concluded it would not create a taxable event because\r\nneither the percentages of ownership nor the identities of the owners would\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nHe further testified that, as of the date of trial, Crossroads was liable for\r\n$2,936,710.50: $1,900,000 remained owing on a bank loan; $75,000, to\r\nHawkensen; $783,460.50, to park Regency; $201,000, to Landy; and $4,150, to a\r\ncompany called Capital Gaines. In addition, Crossroads had advanced $27,000 to\r\nWhitmire. On September 27, 2010, Gentile prepared a balance sheet for\r\nCrossroads showing those debts as liabilities. According to Gentile, it was not\r\nunusual for an LLC to carry its members' contributions as liabilities, but that\r\napproach would be reflected in the company's operating agreement. He opined that\r\nif Crossroads regarded its members' contributions as liabilities, the net value of the\r\ncompany would be zero.\r\n\nOn November 9, 2010, the appraisers returned their report on the remaining\r\nacreage. The appraisers concluded the remaining Property had a market value of\r\n$3,140,000 as of October 29, 2010. In the alternative, the appraisers stated it held\r\na \"120-day liquidation value\" of $725,000 as of the same date.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2010, the trial court entered an order dissociating R&D from\r\nCrossroads and requiring the remaining Tenants to pay R&D up to $265,438 for its\r\ndistributional interest upon the bona fide sale or transfer of the Property. Both\r\nsides filed motions to alter or amend the judgment. In their motion, Appellants\r\ninformed the trial court the ownership of the Property was at risk because their\r\nlender had filed a foreclosure action against Crossroads. Although the trial court\r\ndenied both motions, it nonetheless modified its earlier finding that Park Regency's\r\nand Landy Properties' contributions were \"no interest loans\" to Crossroads to state\r\nthat those payments \"were in the nature of capital contributions, not loans.\" This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhether an action \"is one at law or in equity is determined by the nature of the\r\npleadings and the character of the relief sought.\" In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C.\r\n267, 278, 539 S.E.2d 703, 709 (2000). \"The term 'dissociation' refers to the change\r\nin the relationships among the dissociated member [of an LLC], the company and\r\nthe other members caused by a member's ceasing to be associated in the carrying\r\non of the company's business.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-601 cmt. (2006). Similar\r\nactions terminating business relationships among parties, such as actions for\r\ndissolution, sound in equity. See Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d\r\n129, 131 (2005) (LLC); Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391\r\nS.E.2d 538, 543 (1990) (partnership). Accordingly, an action for dissociation is\r\nalso equitable in nature.\r\n\r\nAn appellate court reviewing a decision in an action in equity may determine facts\r\nin accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\r\nGrosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834 (2005).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Windfall\r\n\r\nAppellants assert the trial court erred in failing to consider relevant and undisputed\r\nevidence affecting the fair value of R&D's distributional interest, including\r\nCrossroads' obligation to repay debt to its other members and economic conditions\r\nimpairing the marketability of Crossroads' single asset. As a result, Appellants\r\ncontend the trial court improperly placed R&D \"in a better position than it would\r\nhave held as a member in good standing.\" We affirm but modify the trial court's\r\norder as discussed below.\r\n\r\n\"The operating agreement of [an LLC] is a binding contract that governs the\r\nrelations among the members, managers, and the company.\" Clary v. Borrell, 398\r\nS.C. 287, 297, 727 S.E.2d 773, 778 (Ct. App. 2012). South Carolina law provides,\r\n\"all members of [an LLC] may enter into an operating agreement, which need not\r\nbe in writing, . . . to govern relations among the members, managers, and\r\ncompany.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-103(a) (2006). \"Generally, operating\r\nagreements are superior to statutory authority where they are in place and address a\r\nmatter, inasmuch as it is only when an operating agreement is silent as to some\r\nmatter that statutory law will apply.\" Clary, 398 S.C. at 297, 727 S.E.2d at 778.\r\n\r\nA court reviewing a written contract must discern:\r\n\r\n             [T]he intention of the parties and the meaning[, which]\r\n             are gathered primarily from the contents of the writing\r\n             itself, or, as otherwise stated, from the four corners of the\r\n             instrument, and when such contract is clear and\r\n             unequivocal, its meaning must be determined by its\r\n             contents alone; and a meaning cannot be given it other\r\n             than that expressed. Hence words cannot be read into a\r\n             contract which import an intent wholly unexpressed\r\n             when the contract was executed.\r\n\r\nMcPherson v. J.E. Sirrine & Co., 206 S.C. 183, 204, 33 S.E.2d 501, 509 (1945);\r\nsee also ERIE Ins. Co. v. Winter Constr. Co., 393 S.C. 455, 460, 713 S.E.2d 318,\r\n321 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"It is not the function of the court to rewrite contracts for\r\nparties.\"). \"Where an agreement is clear and capable of legal interpretation, the\r\ncourt's only function is to interpret its lawful meaning, discover the intention of the\r\n\nparties as found within the agreement, and give effect to it.\" Heins v. Heins, 344\r\nS.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nWe affirm but modify the trial court's order to require reimbursement of Park\r\nRegency's and Landy Properties' contributions prior to a determination of R&D's\r\ndistributional interest, but only in the event Appellants elect to pay R&D after the\r\nsale or other disposition of the Property. Before concluding the TIC Agreement\r\ncontrolled the valuation of R&D's distributional interest, the trial court carefully\r\nconsidered all circumstances affecting R&D's dissociation and reviewed the\r\napplicable law. We find that, in fashioning its solution to a complex problem, the\r\ntrial court overlooked the likelihood that its decision awarded R&D a greater\r\npayout from the sale of the Property than it would have received had it remained a\r\nmember of Crossroads or than the remaining Tenants would receive.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the parties had adopted the TIC Agreement as Crossroads' de\r\nfacto operating agreement. None of the parties challenged this finding on appeal;\r\ntherefore, it is the law of the case. See Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455, 458-59, 674\r\nS.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of the case and\r\nmay not be reviewed on appeal). Accordingly, the TIC Agreement governs the\r\nrelationships among the Tenants and between the Tenants and Crossroads. See\r\nClary, 398 S.C. at 297, 727 S.E.2d at 778 (construing section 33-44-103(a) to say\r\nan LLC's operating agreement binds its members and supersedes statute in matters\r\naddressed by the operating agreement).\r\n\r\n      A.     TIC Agreement\r\n\r\nIn dissociating a member of an LLC whose sole asset suffered from a depressed\r\nvalue due to a poor economy, the trial court crafted a remedy using the valuation\r\nformula from the TIC Agreement's dissociation provisions. That valuation formula\r\nprovides:    . . . [T]he purchase price of [a dissociating member's]\r\n             interest shall be 75% of the Determination as defined\r\n             below, less any sums due and owing by the transferring\r\n             co-Tenant.\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\n             After a conclusive determination of the fair market value\r\n             of the Property is made as provided herein (the\r\n             \"Determination\"), the purchase price payable to the\r\n             Transferring Co-Tenant shall equal the difference of (i)\r\n             the product of (x) the Determination multiplied by (y) the\r\n             Proportionate Share of the Transferring Co-Tenant less\r\n             (ii) the product of (x) the Proportionate Share of the\r\n             Transferring Co-Tenant multiplied by (y) all outstanding\r\n             Obligations as of the date of the closing of the\r\n             Transferring Co-Tenant's interest.\r\n\r\nParagraph 10(a) defined \"Obligations\" as \"taxes, maintenance, insurance and\r\npayments on any outstanding mortgages on the Property or any other expenses\r\nrequired by the Horizontal Developer or any property manager and approved by\r\nCo-Tenants holding at least fifty[-]one percent (51%) of the Proportionate Shares,\r\nin connection with the operation of the Property.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the remedy in this case should be based upon the\r\nentirety of the TIC Agreement and not solely the dissociation provisions. Its\r\nsolution discards some requirements of the dissociation provisions and imposes\r\nother requirements found elsewhere in the TIC Agreement. For example, rather\r\nthan imposing the 270-day time limit for closing the purchase of the dissociating\r\nTenant's interest described in Paragraph 11(c)(iii), the trial court permitted\r\nAppellants to elect whether to purchase R&D's interest upon the bona fide sale of\r\nthe Property or sooner.8 Should Crossroads sell the Property before purchasing\r\nR&D's interest, Appellants would use the actual sale price of the Property to\r\ncalculate the value of R&D's interest. In those circumstances, the purchase price of\r\nR&D's interest could not exceed $265,438, its purchase price based upon the fair\r\nmarket value of the Property provided by the appraiser. The trial court further\r\nfound that treating R&D as a transferring member under the provisions of\r\n\r\n8 We recognize that allowing Crossroads to delay purchasing R&D's interest in the\r\nproperty delays the resolution of this matter. Both the TIC Agreement and the\r\napplicable statute establish deadlines for the conclusion of a member's dissociation.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-701 (2006) (establishing time limits for company to\r\npurchase a dissociating member's interest). However, this approach also provides\r\nan opportunity for all parties, including R&D, to maximize their investments in the\r\nProperty by waiting for the market to improve. Furthermore, no party appealed the\r\ntrial court's failure to impose such a deadline.\r\n\nParagraph 11(a) of the TIC Agreement \"would be inequitable,\" in that it \"could\r\nunduly burden [Crossroads] and could result in a windfall for R&D.\"9\r\n\r\nWe further agree with the trial court's solution, which invokes other provisions of\r\nthe TIC Agreement, including the profit and distribution provisions of paragraphs\r\n6(d) and 9, and particularly in the event Appellants purchase R&D's distributional\r\ninterest upon the sale of the Property. Paragraphs 6(d) and 9 memorialize the\r\nparties' desire to support and benefit from their common enterprise in proportion to\r\ntheir respective ownership interests. Paragraph 9 expresses their intent to share\r\nany profits and bear any losses in proportion to their respective ownership interests\r\nin Crossroads: \"Any net income, gain or loss from the operation of the Property . . .\r\nshall be allocated among the Co-Tenants in accordance with their Proportionate\r\nShare[s].\" Paragraph 6(d) echoes this intent but provides a hierarchy for payments\r\nin the event the Property generates more income than is necessary for its day-to-\r\nday operations. Specifically, it provides:\r\n\r\n             Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar\r\n             quarter, Co-Tenants agree to cause the property manager\r\n             when appointed to pay to each Co-Tenant Available Cash\r\n             (as defined below) as follows:\r\n\r\n             (i) first, to Park Regency, an amount equal to its invested\r\n             capital and then to Landy [Properties] in an amount equal\r\n             to its invested capital, plus in each case any and all costs\r\n             associated with the transactions contemplated by this\r\n             Agreement (i[.]e. legal and other professional fees).\r\n\r\n             (ii) second, to Hawkensen, an amount equal to its unpaid\r\n             hard costs including costs prior to closing such as initial\r\n             contract deposit, engineering, surveying, etc. in\r\n             accordance with the attached Exhibit B.\r\n\r\n\r\n9 By refusing to apply Paragraph 11(a), the trial court prevented R&D from selling\r\nits interest in Crossroads to a third party. Paragraph 11(a) required a transferring\r\nmember to give the other Tenants notice of its intent to transfer its interest. If none\r\nof the other Tenants offered to purchase that interest within thirty days of the\r\nnotice, the transferring member would have 180 days in which to \"sell, transfer, or\r\notherwise convey its interest\" to someone else.\r\n\n             (iii) finally, to each Co-Tenant its Proportionate Share.\r\n\r\n             \"Available Cash\" shall be any cash generated by the\r\n             Property in excess of that reasonably necessary for the\r\n             operation of the Property, including payments on the\r\n             loans, reserves for expenses, repairs and such capital\r\n             improvements that Co-Tenants holding at least sixty\r\n             percent (60%) of Proportionate Shares, in their\r\n             reasonable discretion, determine should be made.\r\n\r\nThe trial court permitted Crossroads to pay R&D for its distributional interest\r\neither before or after the sale or transfer of the Property. Were Crossroads to pay\r\nR&D while it still owned the Property, it would retain both its equity in the\r\nProperty and the potential for greater profit. These appear to be the circumstances\r\nthe parties contemplated when they drafted the dissociation provisions. However,\r\nwere Crossroads to sell or transfer the Property first, no further potential for profit\r\nfrom disposing of the Property would exist. Our review of the entire TIC\r\nAgreement suggests the parties did not anticipate dissociating a member upon the\r\nsale of the Property. The trial court's employment of requirements not appearing in\r\nthe TIC Agreement's dissociation provisions suggests it reached the same\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, to the extent the trial court's decision permits Crossroads to purchase\r\nR&D's distributional interest before selling the Property, we affirm. Crossroads\r\nmay elect to purchase R&D's interest for $265,438 at any time prior to selling the\r\nProperty, and its remaining members may recoup their contributions under the\r\ndistribution scheme of Paragraph 6(d). To the extent the trial court's decision\r\nprovides for Crossroads to purchase R&D's interest after the bona fide sale or other\r\ntransfer of the Property, we modify the trial court's order to require any calculation\r\nof the \"Obligations\" to add the amounts of Park Regency's and Landy Properties'\r\ncontributions as obligations owed by Crossroads.10\r\n\r\n      B.     Remaining Arguments\r\n\r\nAppellants' remaining arguments concerning the economic conditions and the\r\ncontributions' status as loans are unpersuasive. The trial court clearly considered\r\n\r\n10We observe the parties' written agreements did not provide for the recovery of\r\nthe contributions of any other member.\r\n\nthese arguments in making its final decision, which relies upon and incorporates\r\nthe language in the TIC Agreement. This decision made allowance for the\r\ndepressed economic conditions by permitting Crossroads to delay purchasing\r\nR&D's interest until a bona fide sale of the Property.\r\n\r\nII.   Judgment and Offset\r\n\r\nAppellants assert the trial court erred in treating R&D's liability to Crossroads'\r\nother members as an offset against the fair value of its distributional interest\r\ninstead of entering an immediately enforceable judgment against R&D. In support,\r\nthey note they brought suit against Respondents both as individuals and on behalf\r\nof Crossroads. We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, an LLC \"is a legal entity distinct from its members.\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 33-44-201 (2006). A member of an LLC:\r\n\r\n            [M]ay maintain an action against . . . another member . . .\r\n            for legal or equitable relief, with or without an\r\n            accounting as to the company's business, to enforce:\r\n\r\n            (1) the member's rights under the operating agreement;\r\n            . . . and\r\n\r\n            (3) the rights that otherwise protect the interests of the\r\n            member, including rights and interests arising\r\n            independently of the member's relationship to the\r\n            company.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-410(a) (2006).\r\n\r\nA personal inability to perform does not excuse a member's failure to meet its\r\nobligation to contribute to the LLC. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-402(a) (2006). \"If a\r\nmember does not make the required contribution of property or services, the\r\nmember is obligated at the option of the company to contribute money equal to the\r\nvalue of that portion of the stated contribution which has not been made.\" Id.\r\nWhen a member of an LLC makes payments \"for the preservation of [the LLC's]\r\nbusiness or property,\" those payments constitute an interest-bearing loan to the\r\ncompany which it must repay. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-403 (2006).\r\n\nWe affirm the trial court's decision and note specifically the trial court's findings\r\nthat:        [Appellants] also assert that they should have been\r\n             granted judgment against R&D for its failure to pay the\r\n             interest on the mortgage loan on the [Property], as\r\n             required by the [TIC Agreement], which also served as\r\n             the operating agreement of the LLC. First of all, the\r\n             judgment, if granted, would be in favor of Crossroads,\r\n             not the other [Appellants]. R&D's contractual obligation\r\n             was to the LLC.\r\n\r\nThe trial court added that any judgment against R&D would serve to increase the\r\npurchase price of its distributional interest, which was already reduced by the\r\namount of the interest payments made by the other Tenants.\r\n\r\nAlthough Appellants brought this action both as individuals and on behalf of\r\nCrossroads, we find the evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that R&D's default\r\naffected Appellants in their capacities as members of the LLC, not as individuals.\r\nR&D's failure to satisfy its contribution obligations harmed Crossroads. See Â§ 33-\r\n44-201 (stating an LLC is a separate legal entity from its members). Accordingly,\r\nany cause of action arising from R&D's failure to meet its contribution obligations\r\nbelonged to Crossroads. The harm Appellants suffered resulted from their decision\r\nto make the payments in R&D's stead. Under section 33-44-403, those payments\r\nconstitute interest-bearing loans, which the LLC is obligated to repay. As a result,\r\nAppellants' cause of action for repayment of the loans is against Crossroads, not\r\nR&D.\r\n\r\nFinally, we find the trial court's decision to reduce the purchase price of R&D's\r\ndistributional interest by the amounts R&D failed to pay comports with the TIC\r\nAgreement. In Paragraph 10(a), the parties stated that, in the event of an uncured\r\nbreach by R&D, the remaining Tenants could \"acquire R&D's interest at three\r\nquarters of the fair market value of the [P]roperty, reduced further by any payment\r\noutstanding by R&D.\" Paragraph 11(c)(ii) recites their agreement to subtract from\r\nthe purchase price of a dissociating member's distributional interest \"any sums due\r\nand owing by the [dissociating member].\" Accordingly, the trial court's\r\nrequirement that Appellants subtract the amounts R&D owed Crossroads from the\r\npurchase price of its distributional interest harmonizes with both the applicable\r\nstatute and the TIC Agreement.\r\n\nTo the extent Appellants argue under other theories, we decline to address those\r\narguments as unpreserved.11 Generally, an \"appellate court will not consider any\r\nfact which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.\" Rule 210(h), SCACR. The\r\nburden of presenting a record sufficient to allow appellate review lies with the\r\nappellant. Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d\r\n485, 487-88 (2005). The record in this matter does not indicate which arguments\r\nAppellants raised in their Rule 59(e) motion or at the hearing on that motion. As a\r\nresult, the record is insufficient for this court to determine whether any additional\r\narguments are preserved.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in fashioning an equitable solution to R&D's\r\ndissociation from the terms in the TIC Agreement. However, to the extent the trial\r\ncourt's decision provides for Crossroads to purchase R&D's distributional interest\r\nafter the bona fide sale or other transfer of the Property, we modify the trial court's\r\norder to require any such calculation to add the amounts of Park Regency's and\r\nLandy Properties' contributions to the Obligations, as monies owed by Crossroads.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we find the trial court's grant of judgment to Crossroads, only, and its\r\ndecision to reduce the purchase price of R&D's distributional interest by the\r\namount of its debt to Crossroads comport with both the applicable statute and the\r\nTIC Agreement. Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., Concurs in part and dissents in part.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: I concur with the\r\nmajority as to section II of the LAW/ANALYSIS section. I disagree, however,\r\nwith the majority's resolution of the fair value of R&D's distributional interest. To\r\nthat extent, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n11Therefore, we do not reach the question of whether a co-surety who pays more\r\nthan his proportionate share of a loan obligation may sue another co-surety on the\r\ntheory his recovery is subrogated to the rights of the lender.\r\n\nThis business dispute could have been resolved very simply if the participants in\r\nthe transaction had properly documented their agreement and the changes they\r\nmade to it over time. Because they did not do so, the courts have been forced to\r\nfashion a resolution. In my opinion, the trial court placed too much emphasis on\r\nthe tenancy in common agreement. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-702(a)(1) (2006)\r\n(listing \"any agreement among . . . the members\" as one factor the court shall\r\nconsider in \"determin[ing] the fair value of the [distributional] interest\" in an\r\nLLC). Considering all indicators of the fair value of R&D's interest, particularly\r\nthe participants' intent expressed at the time they entered this transaction that the\r\nfunds contributed by Park Regency and Landy Properties were to be paid back to\r\nthem before the value of any participant's interest was calculated, I would set the\r\nfair value of R&D's distributional interest at $72,421.88.12 When that figure is\r\noffset by the amount R&D owes for refusing to make the interest payments it\r\nagreed to make, the amount due to R&D for its interest is zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12I arrived at this figure by deducting the funds contributed by Park Regency and\r\nLandy Properties and the amount of Crossroads' other liabilities from the appraised\r\nvalue of the property. I applied R&D's 47.5% ownership interest to that figure and\r\nreduced the result by the 25% default penalty in the tenancy in common\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Appraised Value of the Property                      $3,140,000.00\r\n         Park Regency and Landy Properties                  - $984,560.50\r\n         Crossroads' Other Liabilities                      - $1,952,150.00\r\n                                                                 $203,289.50\r\n         R&D's Ownership Interest                                      0.475\r\n                                                             x    $96,562.51\r\n         Penalty for Default                                            0.75\r\n                                                             x\r\n\r\n         Amount Due to R&D                                        $72,421.88\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5057","title":"Swilling v.

Mullinax, of Mullinax Law Firm, both of\r\nAnderson, for Respondent.\r\n\nSHORT, J.: Terry Scott Swilling, Employee/Claimant, filed this workers'\r\ncompensation action against Pride Masonry of Gaffney, Employer, and Central\r\nMutual Insurance Company, Carrier (collectively, Pride). Pride appealed, arguing\r\nerror in the following: (1) the calculation of Swilling's average weekly wage; (2)\r\nthe finding of permanent and total disability (PTD); (3) the finding that a\r\nsubsequent injury was proximately caused by a work-related injury; and (4) the\r\naward of a lump-sum payment. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2006, while employed as a stonemason for Pride, Swilling was injured\r\nas he operated a skid steer to build a cement block room on a construction site.\r\nSwilling twisted his left ankle when he stepped out of the skid steer and fell onto\r\ngravel. He also struck his head, left elbow, and back. Swilling severely injured his\r\nleft leg, resulting in two surgeries and an epidural steroid block. Subsequently, he\r\nexperienced severe pain extending from his foot into his hip and back. This caused\r\nhim to place more pressure on his right leg and resulted in an antalgic gait.\r\nSwilling filed a workers' compensation claim for PTD. He claimed an average\r\nweekly wage of $840, based on $21 per hour at forty hours per week, with a\r\ncorresponding compensation rate of $560.03.\r\n\r\nPride admitted the injury but denied Swilling was entitled to PTD. Pride also\r\ncontested Swilling's average weekly wage, alleging a weekly wage of $742.14 with\r\na compensation rate of $494.79. Finally, Pride sought credit for overpayment of\r\nbenefits because Swilling suffered two subsequent accidents: a June 2009\r\nmotorcycle accident and an April 2010 automobile accident.\r\n\r\nAt an August 2010 hearing before a single commissioner of the South Carolina\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission (the Commission), Swilling testified he has\r\nbeen in the masonry business his entire working life. He is married and has two\r\nchildren. Although he graduated from high school in 1981, he reads at a third-\r\ngrade level and cannot write, but he can sign his name.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the hearing, Swilling testified he was still experiencing excruciating\r\npain in his foot, whole leg, and back, and he wore a brace from his left ankle to his\r\nknee and another brace on his right leg. He continued to use narcotic pain\r\nmedication. It made him sleepy and dizzy, which caused him to fall. He had\r\nattempted to discontinue its use, but he suffered severe pain without the\r\nmedication. Swilling also suffered migraines and depression, and he was being\r\n\ntreated by a psychiatrist. His sleep was disrupted due to pain, and he slept during\r\nthe day in a sitting position. He admitted he suffered anxiety due to numerous\r\nbreak-ins at his house in 2008. Swilling also testified he attempted to return to\r\nwork as a delivery driver, but he became sleepy and was afraid he would cause an\r\naccident. He worked between surgeries performing light-duty labor for Pride.\r\n\r\nSwilling admitted he was injured in the 2009 motorcycle accident, but he explained\r\nit affected the upper right side of his body and did not exacerbate his left leg injury.\r\nHe also testified the 2010 automobile accident resulted in four broken ribs, but it\r\ndid not contribute to the disability caused by his work-related accident. On cross-\r\nexamination, Swilling disputed the medical records, which indicated he injured his\r\nback in the motorcycle and automobile accidents. Swilling also maintained an\r\nApril 2010 fall was related to his work-related injury.\r\n\r\nPride admitted Swilling earned $21 per hour. Rather than file a claim with its\r\ncarrier, Pride paid Swilling's medical bills until February 2010, when it began\r\nsending the bills to its insurance carrier. Pride paid Swilling a salary of $840 per\r\nweek until March 2010, when Swilling could no longer work. The carrier did not\r\nmake any payments.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner found Swilling to be a credible witness. The\r\ncommissioner also found although Pride was duly notified of the accident, it failed\r\nto report it to the Commission, and Swilling was paid $21 per hour for forty hours\r\nper week resulting in an average weekly wage of $840, which was the salary he\r\nwas earning at the time of the accident. The commissioner found exceptional\r\nreasons existed to deviate from the Form 20, pursuant to section 42-1-40 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code, and he found Swilling's average weekly wage to be $840\r\nwith a corresponding compensation rate of $560.03.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner also determined Swilling's injuries from the work-related\r\naccident alone, despite the subsequent motorcycle and automobile accidents,\r\nrendered him permanently and totally disabled. The commissioner ordered\r\ntemporary total disability of $11,200.60 from March 2010 to the date of the\r\nhearing; reimbursement of medical bills; a lump-sum award of $228,657.84 for the\r\nremainder of Swilling's entitlement to five hundred weeks of compensation; and\r\npayment of future causally-related medical bills to his left leg, right leg, back, and\r\npsychological condition.\r\n\nPride filed a Form 30 Request for Commission Review. An appellate panel of the\r\nSouth Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission heard the matter. Other than\r\namending the award to prorate the lump-sum award to minimize the reduction of\r\nSwilling's Social Security benefits pursuant to James v. Anne's Inc., 390 S.C. 188,\r\n701 S.E.2d 730 (2010), the Commission affirmed the single commissioner. Pride\r\nappealed, and the circuit court affirmed. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs appeals from the\r\ndecisions of the Commission. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2011); Lark v.\r\nBi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the scope of\r\nreview established in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that\r\nof the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\nreverse or modify the Commission's decision if the appellant's substantial rights\r\nhave been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is\r\n\"clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the\r\nwhole record.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2011). Our supreme court\r\nhas defined substantial evidence as evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole,\r\nwould allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the Commission\r\nreached. Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Average Weekly Wage\r\n\r\nPride argues the Commission erred in calculating Swilling's average weekly wage.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pride's Form 20, Swilling was hired on April 3, 2006, and his injury\r\noccurred on June 8, 2006. Swilling continued to work for several months until his\r\nfirst surgery. Until 2010, Swilling worked when he was able, performing light\r\nduty. He was paid $21 per hour for forty hours per week, totaling $840 per week.\r\nOn the Form 20, Pride calculated Swilling's average weekly wage by claiming\r\nearnings of $28,943.50 over a period of thirty-nine working weeks for an average\r\nwage of $742.14 per week.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code provides for the calculation of the\r\naverage weekly wage. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (Supp. 2011). \"The statute\r\n\nprovides an elasticity or flexibility with a view toward always achieving the\r\nultimate objective of reflecting fairly a claimant's probable future earning loss.\"\r\nSellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 698 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002). \"The objective of wage calculation is to arrive at a fair approximation\r\nof the claimant's probable future earning capacity.\" Bennett v. Gary Smith\r\nBuilders, 271 S.C. 94, 98-99, 245 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1978).\r\n\r\nIn Pugh v. Piedmont Mechanical, 396 S.C. 31, 38, 719 S.E.2d 676, 680 (Ct. App.\r\n2011), this court explained:\r\n\r\n            The primary method for calculating the average weekly\r\n            wage is to take \"the total wages paid for the last four\r\n            quarters divided by fifty-two or by the actual number of\r\n            weeks for which wages were paid, whichever is less.\" Â§\r\n            42-1-40; Pilgrim v. Eaton, 391 S.C. 38, 45, 703 S.E.2d\r\n            241, 244 (Ct. App. 2010). \"The [Commission] must use\r\n            this method unless 'the employment, prior to the injury,\r\n            extended over a period of less than fifty-two weeks,' or\r\n            unless 'for exceptional reasons' it would be unfair to do\r\n            so.\" Pilgrim, 391 S.C. at 44-45, 703 S.E.2d at 244 (citing\r\n            Â§ 42-1-40).\r\n\r\n\"When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either to the\r\nemployer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages\r\nmay be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured\r\nemployee would be earning were it not for the injury.\" Â§ 42-1-40.\r\n\r\nThe Commission in Pugh calculated the claimant's average weekly wage for a\r\n2007 injury based on the seventeen-week period he worked prior to the injury.\r\nPugh, 396 S.C. at 37, 719 S.E.2d at 679-80. The primary method of calculating\r\naverage weekly wages was not appropriate because the claimant had not worked\r\nthe fifty-two weeks preceding the injury. Id. at 38, 719 S.E.2d at 680. Therefore,\r\nthe Commission calculated the average weekly wage based on the employer's Form\r\n20, which divided the salary paid by the actual number of weeks the claimant\r\nworked. Id. The Pugh court found when the Commission determines the primary\r\nmethod of calculation is not permissible, \"it is required to consider which of the\r\nalternative methods for calculating the average weekly wage is most appropriate\r\nbased on the facts.\" Id. at 39, 719 S.E.2d at 680. \"Before the [C]ommission may\r\nuse any one of these alternatives, the [C]ommission must find, or the record must\r\n\nclearly show, that the necessary conditions exist.\" Pilgrim v. Eaton, 391 S.C. 38,\r\n45, 703 S.E.2d 241, 244 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\r\nPride argues the Commission should have calculated Swilling's average weekly\r\nwage based on the income he earned over thirty-nine weeks. This is the method\r\nutilized by the Commission in Pugh, and it \"is proper if two 'predicate conditions'\r\nexist: (1) it is 'practicable' to use the alternative method and (2) the calculation\r\nyields a result 'fair and just' to both parties.\" Pugh, 396 S.C. at 39, 719 S.E.2d at\r\n680 (quoting Pilgrim, 391 S.C. at 46, 703 S.E.2d at 245).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Commission adopted the single commissioner's order finding\r\n\"pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40, exceptional reasons exist[ed] to deviate\r\nfrom the Form 20.\" The Commission also found the following: (1) Pride paid\r\nSwilling his regular salary of $840 per week after the injury, which was\r\nsubstantiated by Swilling's W-2s and tax returns; (2) although Pride's payment\r\ncould be deemed benevolent, its motive was questionable and appeared to be an\r\nattempt to avoid filing a claim with its insurance carrier; and (3) Pride ceased\r\nworking only when he could no longer physically perform his duties. We find the\r\nCommission's use of the statutory language indicates it was cognizant of the\r\nrequirement to show the \"necessary conditions to deviate\" existed. See Pilgrim,\r\n391 S.C. at 45, 703 S.E.2d at 244 (requiring the Commission to find, or the record\r\nto clearly show, the necessary conditions to deviate exist before employing one of\r\nthe alternative methods of calculating average weekly wage). We also find\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record supports the Commission's findings. See Roberts\r\nv. McNair Law Firm, 366 S.C. 50, 53-54, 619 S.E.2d 453, 455-56 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(applying the substantial evidence standard of review to affirm the Commission's\r\nfinding regarding whether the claimant was entitled to deviation from the statutory\r\nmethod of calculating average weekly wages).\r\n\r\nB.    Partial and Total Disability\r\n\r\nPride next argues the Commission erred in finding Swilling suffered PTD. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nSwilling's vocational expert, Dr. Benson Hecker, opined that given Swilling's age,\r\neducation, vocational background, lack of transferable skills, impairments,\r\nlimitations, and chronic pain, Swilling was \"not job ready\" and was totally\r\ndisabled. Dr. Robert A. Dameron, Jr., opined Swilling had a forty-eight percent\r\nimpairment of the left lower extremity and an eleven percent impairment of the\r\n\nspine. He also opined Swilling would require ongoing pain management treatment\r\nand psychological support. Dameron concluded \"[i]t is unlikely [Swilling] will be\r\nable to return to gainful employment.\" Swilling's orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. George\r\nR. Bruce, concluded Swilling had a forty-seven percent left lower extremity\r\nimpairment and a decreased range of motion, which combined for a sixty percent\r\nleft lower extremity impairment and equaled a twenty-four percent whole person\r\nimpairment. Swilling also received a ten percent mental/emotional impairment\r\nrating.\r\n\r\nA claimant is entitled to a finding of PTD \"[w]hen the incapacity for work\r\nresulting from an injury is total.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10(A) (Supp. 2011). Our\r\nsupreme court explained PTD in Stephenson v. Rice Services, Inc., 323 S.C. 113,\r\n117-18, 473 S.E.2d 699, 701-02 (1996) (footnotes and final citation omitted):\r\n\r\n            There are two situations in which the Commission can\r\n            find a claimant totally disabled. First, for certain\r\n            conditions resulting from work-related injuries, a\r\n            claimant is deemed totally disabled and need not\r\n            demonstrate loss of earning capacity to recover workers'\r\n            compensation benefits. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-\r\n            10 (Supp. 1994) (classifying loss of certain limbs and\r\n            body parts as total disability as a matter of law;\r\n            classifying as total disability paraplegia, quadriplegia,\r\n            and physical brain damage resulting from compensable\r\n            injuries) . . . . Under the circumstances in which a\r\n            worker is deemed totally disabled, the medical model of\r\n            workers' compensation predominates.\r\n\r\n            In contrast, the earning impairment model predominates\r\n            when a worker is not statutorily deemed totally disabled.\r\n            Under this model, the Commission may predicate a\r\n            finding of total disability on the claimant's complete loss\r\n            of earning capacity as a result of a work-related injury.\r\n            See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-120 (1985) (\"The term\r\n            'disability' means incapacity because of injury to earn the\r\n            wages which the employee was receiving at the time of\r\n            injury in the same or any other employment.\"); S.C. Code\r\n            Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 1994) (\"When the incapacity for\r\n            work resulting from an injury is total, the employer shall\r\n\n             pay . . . to the injured employee during the total disability\r\n             . . . .\"); Wynn v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., 238 S.C. 1,\r\n             118 S.E.2d 812 (1961). Employees who because of a\r\n             work-related injury can perform only limited tasks for\r\n             which no reasonably stable market exists are considered\r\n             totally disabled notwithstanding their nominal earning\r\n             capacity.\r\n\r\nThus, the economic model defines disability in terms of a claimant's loss of earning\r\ncapacity, and the medical model defines disability based upon specific degrees of\r\nmedical impairment to specified body parts. Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc., 354\r\nS.C. 100, 104, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 (2003). \"[T]he extent of disability is a\r\nquestion of fact to be proved as any other fact is proved.\" Hanks v. Blair Mills,\r\nInc., 286 S.C. 378, 384, 335 S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1985). Findings of fact by the\r\nCommission are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard of review, and\r\nthis court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the\r\nweight of the evidence on questions of fact. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-\r\n35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).\r\n\r\nIn its brief, Pride points to other medical evidence in the record indicating at least\r\none of Swilling's physicians encouraged him to return to work, another described\r\nhim as stable and able to walk without a brace, and an evaluation conducted in\r\n2009 indicated Swilling was qualified to perform several types of employment.\r\nHowever, when the evidence is conflicting, the findings of the Commission are\r\nconclusive. Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611\r\n(Ct. App. 2004). Accordingly, this court will not overturn a finding of fact by the\r\nCommission \"unless there is no reasonable probability that the facts could be as\r\nrelated by a witness upon whose testimony the finding was based.\" Lark, 276 S.C.\r\nat 136, 276 S.E.2d at 307 (quoting Indep. Stave Co. v. Fulton, 476 S.W.2d 792,\r\n793 (Ark. 1972)). We find there was substantial evidence to affirm the\r\nCommission's factual finding that Swilling's work-related injury caused PTD.\r\n\r\nC.    Subsequent Injury\r\n\r\nPride next argues the Commission erred in finding Swilling's April 2010 fall was\r\nrelated to his work-related injury. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn explaining his April 2010 fall, Swilling testified he fell from his back porch\r\nwhen his left leg \"gave out\" while he was entering his house. He hit his head on a\r\n\nstepping stone and sought treatment at the emergency room. The Commission\r\nfound the April 2010 accident was related to his leg and ordered Pride to reimburse\r\nthe medical providers for all related treatment.\r\n\r\n\"Every natural consequence that flows from a work-related compensable injury is\r\nalso compensable unless the consequence is the result of an independent,\r\nintervening cause sufficient to break the chain of causation.\" Tims v. J.D. Kitts\r\nConstr., 393 S.C. 496, 504, 713 S.E.2d 340, 344 (Ct. App. 2011) (citations\r\nomitted). We find substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding. See\r\nSanders v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 379 S.C. 554, 559-62, 666 S.E.2d 297, 300-01\r\n(Ct. App. 2008) (applying the substantial evidence standard of review to the\r\nCommission's determination of whether a subsequent fall was related to a\r\npreviously compensable knee injury).\r\n\r\nD.    Lump-Sum Payment\r\n\r\nPride finally argues the Commission erred in awarding Swilling a lump-sum\r\npayment. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSwilling testified to financial distress caused by Pride's cessation of payments five\r\nmonths prior to the hearing before the single commissioner. He explained he was\r\n\"close to losing [his] house,\" and he had to \"get food stamps and beg for money\" to\r\nsupport his family. Although Swilling is functionally illiterate, he is able to count\r\nmoney. Furthermore, a treating psychologist reported he manifested an average\r\nlevel of intellectual potential.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner found Swilling's best interests would be served by the\r\nreceipt of a lump-sum payment, and the award should be paid in a lump sum based\r\nupon the evidence and testimony presented. The Commission modified the award\r\npursuant to James v. Anne's Inc., 390 S.C. 188, 701 S.E.2d 730 (2010), to avoid\r\nany negative impact on Swilling's entitlement to Social Security benefits. See id. at\r\n199-200, 701 S.E.2d at 736 (\"The purpose of allocating a lump[-]sum disability\r\naward over the claimant's lifetime is to make sure a claimant is not being\r\neconomically penalized by the Social Security Administration's calculation of an\r\noffset. The Social Security Administration expressly recognizes and accepts such\r\nallocations as a matter of routine practice.\").\r\n\r\nOur legislature set forth a special standard for review of lump-sum awards as\r\nfollows: \"Upon a finding by the [C]ommission that a lump[-]sum payment should\r\n\nbe made, the burden of proof as to the abuse of discretion in such finding shall be\r\nupon the employer or carrier in any appeal proceedings.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-\r\n301 (1985). Accordingly, our review of a lump-sum award is under the abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard, rather than the substantial evidence standard of review\r\nordinarily employed in reviewing factual findings of the Commission. Thompson\r\nv. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 878 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\"An abuse of discretion occurs if the Commission's findings are wholly\r\nunsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by an error\r\nof law.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a workers' compensation award is to provide a substitute for the\r\nwages of the injured employee, and the ordinary payment of compensation is in\r\ninstallment payments. Woods v. Sumter Stress-Crete, Inc., 266 S.C. 245, 247-48,\r\n222 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1976). \"In determining whether to award a lump[-]sum\r\npayment to a claimant, the Commission must consider whether the award will\r\ncause a hardship to the employer or carrier and whether the payment would be in\r\nthe best interest of the claimant and his family.\" Thompson, 369 S.C. at 616, 632\r\nS.E.2d at 880. In Thompson, this court affirmed a partial lump-sum award when\r\nthe injured employee required funds to build a new house due to his work-related\r\nparaplegia, and there was no credible evidence the funds would be squandered. Id.\r\nat 616-17, 632 S.E.2d at 880. Likewise, this court summarily affirmed a lump-sum\r\naward when the claimant \"demonstrated an ability to manage large sums of money\r\nin a prudent fashion\" and testified he needed the funds to do major repair work to\r\nhis house, which would be more costly if the repairs were not done in a timely\r\nfashion. Cox v. Mills, 286 S.C. 226, 227, 332 S.E.2d 562, 563 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\nIn this case, Swilling presented evidence the lump-sum award would be in his best\r\ninterest. Furthermore, Pride offered no evidence of hardship arising from a lump-\r\nsum award. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion by the Commission in\r\nawarding a lump sum.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
