King, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4539\r\nHeard February 18, 2009 â€“ Filed May 5,\r\n  2009\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Kathrine H. Hudgins, of\r\n  Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY,\r\n  J.:Â  Jennifer Bryant appeals the trial court's revocation of her probation\r\n  based on her failure to pay restitution.Â  Bryant alleges the trial court erred\r\n  in: (1) failing to obtain a valid waiver of her right to counsel at the\r\n  probation revocation hearing and (2) failing to find Bryant willfully failed to\r\n  pay restitution.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAn\r\n  Orangeburg County grand jury indicted Bryant for passing stolen lottery\r\n  tickets, and Bryant pled guilty to the charges.Â  The trial court sentenced her\r\n  to five years of probation and ordered her to pay $11,822.51 in restitution and\r\n  $643.75 in fines.Â  The trial court ordered Bryant to pay $500 on the day of the\r\n  sentence, $2,500 in six months, and make monthly payments afterwards as set by\r\n  probation.Â  Bryant failed to pay any of the restitution by the original due\r\n  date, and a trial judge restructured the restitution payment plan.Â  Bryant made\r\n  sporadic payments towards her fines and restitution for the next year and a\r\n  half, but made no payments thereafter.Â  \r\nSubsequently, the Department of Probation, Parole and\r\n  Pardon Services issued a probation violation citation and served Bryant with a &quot;Notice\r\n  of Probation Violating Hearing and Acknowledgment of Notice&quot; (Probation\r\n  Notice).Â  At the probation hearing, Bryant was not represented by counsel.Â  The\r\n  probation court proceeded with the hearing, inquiring into Bryant's failure to\r\n  pay restitution.Â  Bryant testified she was employed at two different jobs.Â  In\r\n  her first job, she was placed in the Restitution Center and worked at McDonald's\r\n  for six months, enabling her to pay $300 towards restitution.Â Â Â  At her second\r\n  job, she worked at Dawn Pet Care but stopped working there and was not able to\r\n  make the restitution payments since.Â  \r\nUltimately, the probation court found Bryant waived\r\n  her right to counsel and revoked two years of her probationary sentence.Â \r\n  Specifically, the probation court stated: \r\n\r\n\tMs. Bryant, I don't think you take probation very\r\n  seriously.Â  The court is going to revoke two years of her sentence, continue\r\n  her on probation â€“ toll probation while incarcerated, and we'll continue\r\n  probation after her release from incarceration.Â  You've got to learn that you're\r\n  either going to do the time or you're going to pay the money.Â  \r\n\r\nThis\r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tDid the probation court fail to obtain a valid \r\n\t\t\twaiver of the right to counsel from Bryant during the probation \r\n\t\t\trevocation hearing?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tB. \r\n\t\t\tDid the probation court err in failing \r\n\t\t\tto find Bryant willfully failed to pay restitution?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Waiver\r\n  of the Right to Counsel\r\n&quot;The\r\n  Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution guarantee that a person\r\n  brought to trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to\r\n  the assistance of counsel before [s]he can be validly convicted and punished by\r\n  imprisonment.&quot;Â  State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 261, 584 S.E.2d\r\n  131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806,\r\n  807 (1975)).Â  &quot;The right to counsel attaches in probation revocation\r\n  hearings.&quot;Â  Salley v. State, 306 S.C. 213, 215, 410 S.E.2d 921, 922\r\n  (1991). The erroneous deprivation of this right constitutes per se reversible\r\n  error.Â  Thompson, 355 S.C. at 261, 584 S.E.2d at 134.Â  \r\nOne can waive her right to counsel.Â  It is the trial\r\n  court's responsibility to determine whether there was a knowing and intelligent\r\n  wavier by the accused.Â  Id. at 261-62, 584 S.E.2d at 134-35. Â To\r\n  effectuate a valid waiver, the accused must (1) be advised of the right to\r\n  counsel and (2) be adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation.Â  State\r\n    v. McLauren, 349 S.C. 488, 493-94, 563 S.E.2d 346, 348-49 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  In Faretta, the United States Supreme Court requires a defendant to be &quot;made\r\n  aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the\r\n  record will establish that he knows what [s]he is doing and h[er] choice is\r\n  made with eyes open.&quot;Â  422 U.S. at 835 (internal citation omitted).Â  A\r\n  specific inquiry by the trial court expressly addressing the disadvantages of\r\n  appearing pro se is preferred.Â  Thompson, 355 S.C. at 262-63, 584 S.E.2d\r\n  at 135.Â  However, when the trial court fails to expressly make this inquiry, this\r\n  court will examine the record to determine whether the accused had sufficient background\r\n  or was apprised of her rights by some other source. Â McLauren, 349 S.C. at\r\n  494, 563 S.E.2d at 349.\r\nThis\r\n  court can consider the following ten factors to determine if an accused has the\r\n  sufficient background to understand the dangers of self-representation: \r\n\r\n\t(1) the accused's age, educational background, and\r\n  physical and mental health; \r\n\t(2) whether the accused was previously involved in\r\n  criminal trials;\r\n\t(3) whether [s]he knew of the nature of the charge and\r\n  of the possible penalties;\r\n\t(4) whether [s]he was represented by counsel before\r\n  trial or whether an attorney indicated to h[er] the difficulty of\r\n  self-representation in h[er] particular case;\r\n\t(5) whether [s]he was attempting to delay or manipulate\r\n  the proceedings;\r\n\t(6) whether the court appointed stand-by counsel;\r\n\t(7) whether the accused knew [s]he would be required\r\n  to comply with the rules of procedure at trial;\r\n\t(8) whether [s]he knew of legal challenges [s]he could\r\n  raise in defense to the charges against h[er];\r\n\t(9) whether the exchange between the accused and the\r\n  court consisted merely of pro forma answers to pro forma questions; and\r\n\t(10) whether the accused's waiver resulted from either\r\n  coercion or mistreatment.\r\n\r\nId.Â  When looking at the entire record and considering\r\n  these ten factors, we believe Bryant had sufficient background or was apprised\r\n  of her rights by some other source.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  its final ruling, the probation court found Bryant waived her right to\r\n  counsel.Â  Specifically, the probation court stated Bryant &quot;underst[ood]\r\n  the nature of these proceedings, [and] she[] freely and voluntarily waived her\r\n  right to counsel.&quot;Â  In determining whether Bryant validly waived her\r\n  right, we first note the exchange between the probation court and the probationer\r\n  during the probation hearing.Â  There, the probation court noted Bryant was not\r\n  represented by counsel, and engaged in the following colloquy with Bryant:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDo you understand that you have a right to have a \r\n\t\t\tlawyer represent you in connection with these proceedings?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDo you wish for the court to inquire as to whether \r\n\t\t\tyou would be entitled to a court appointed lawyer or do you wish to \r\n\t\t\tgo forward today?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI want to go forward.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; Do you understand that an attorney may \r\n\t\t\tbe of benefit to you, for example, there may be things I need to be \r\n\t\t\ttold that you do not know to tell me, and that if you talk with a \r\n\t\t\tlawyer you and the lawyer would learn these things, do you \r\n\t\t\tunderstand that?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tUnderstanding that, do you still wish to waive your \r\n\t\t\tright to counsel and go forward?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAlright.&nbsp; At anytime before I make a \r\n\t\t\tdetermination in this matter, if you desire to talk to a lawyer all \r\n\t\t\tyou have to do is tell me and I'll stand aside and give you a chance \r\n\t\t\tto talk to a lawyer, do you understand?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  probation court's colloquy adequately informed Bryant of her right to counsel\r\n  and informed Bryant of the benefits of retaining counsel.Â  Further, the\r\n  probation court indicated Bryant could invoke her Sixth Amendment right at any\r\n  point prior to a final ruling.Â  However, the probation court did not expressly\r\n  address the dangers and disadvantages of appearing pro se as required by Faretta\r\n    v. California, 422 U.S. at 835.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  prior to her hearing, Bryant signed a Probation Notice with her probation\r\n  officer.Â  The Probation Notice stated, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\tYou may have an attorney represent you at the\r\n  hearing.Â  If you cannot afford any attorney and you desire the representation\r\n  of the Orangeburg County Public Defender, you must apply for an appointed\r\n  attorney with that office.Â  If you choose to appear at the hearing without an\r\n  attorney, you may be required to represent yourself.Â  You are hereby advised\r\n    that there are dangers and disadvantages to self representation.Â  An attorney\r\n    may better understand courtroom procedure and may be better able to think of\r\n    and present defenses to your probation violations.Â  By appearing without an\r\n  attorney you are acknowledging these dangers but are knowingly and voluntarily\r\n  choosing to proceed without counsel . . . . This directive has been read to me\r\n  and I have been provided with a copy.Â  I was also given an opportunity to ask\r\n  questions about this directive before it was signed.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added)Â  \r\nFurthermore, this was Bryant's third appearance before\r\n  the probation court for violations.Â  Bryant first appeared before the probation\r\n  court for failing to follow the advice and instructions of her supervising\r\n  agent, failing to make payments, and falling in arrears.Â  As a result, the\r\n  probation court extended Bryant's time to pay and placed her on the restitution\r\n  center waiting list, which she later entered.Â  Bryant appeared before the\r\n  probation court a second time for the same violations and there, the probation\r\n  court reduced her payments and ordered her to pay restitution within thirty\r\n  days.Â  Additionally, we note Bryant had previously been represented by counsel\r\n  for her charges.Â  \r\nBased on Bryant's previous experience in the criminal\r\n  justice system, her previous representation by counsel, the signed Probation\r\n  Notice, and the probation court's colloquy with her, we believe Bryant had both\r\n  a sufficient background and was apprised of her rights by some other source.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we recommend affirming the probation court's finding that Bryant\r\n  validly waived her Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  Â Â \r\nB.&nbsp; Finding\r\n  of Willfulness\r\nBecause we find Bryant validly waived her Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to counsel, she was required to comply with our preservation\r\n  requirements.Â  See State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 265 n.5, 589\r\n  S.E.2d 6, 9 n.5 (2003) (&quot;A pro se litigant who knowingly elects to\r\n  represent h[er]self assumes full responsibility for complying with substantive\r\n  and procedural requirements of the law.&quot;).Â  Here, Bryant did not argue she\r\n  did not willfully fail to pay.Â  Because Bryant failed to raise this issue to\r\n  the probation court, it is not preserved for our review.Â  An issue must be raised and ruled upon in the circuit court in order\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. George, 323 S.C. 496,\r\n  510, 476 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1996) (stating an issue must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court in order to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review); State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C.\r\n  642, 648, 511 S.E.2d 94, 96-97 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating the failure to raise the issue of willfulness at a\r\n  probation revocation hearing can waive the right to appeal).Â  The probation court's revocation is therefore \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4540","title":"Clardy v.

Steve\r\n  Clardy and Michael S. Clardy.Â  Specifically, Bodolosky argues the trial court erred\r\n  by ordering him to carry out the terms of his real estate contract with the\r\n  Clardys and deliver title of real property to them.Â  Bodolosky maintains there\r\n  was no &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; between the parties to warrant\r\n  enforcement of the contract.Â  Finally, Bodolosky contends the trial court erred\r\n  in awarding attorney's fees to the Clardys.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in\r\n  part. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis appeal involves a real estate contract dispute\r\n  over the Southerner Motel and the Tradewinds Motel (the Motels) in Myrtle\r\n  Beach.Â  Prior to the present action, Bodolosky was under contract to purchase\r\n  the Motels from Johnny Elvington and Landis Elvington.Â  Bodolosky had not closed\r\n  on his contract when Steve and Jack Clardy approached him about purchasing the Motels.Â \r\n  The Clardys owned the Boardwalk Hotel, which is adjacent to the Motels at\r\n  issue.Â  \r\nThe Clardys received a contract from Bodolosky for the\r\n  purchase of the Motels for $2.4 million on April 28, 2005.Â  Under the terms of\r\n  the contract, the Clardys had to pay $150,000 in nonrefundable earnest money\r\n  and negotiate other contract terms with Scott Long, Bodolosky's attorney.Â  The\r\n  offer to purchase expired on May 2, 2005; however, Bodolosky extended the\r\n  deadline to 5:00 p.m., May 12, 2005.Â  Once the extended deadline expired, the\r\n  Clardys received a letter which indicated Bodolosky had withdrawn the\r\n  contract.Â Â  \r\nMike Clardy then contacted Bodolosky directly and expressed his continued interest in\r\n  purchasing the Motels.Â  Bodolosky indicated he would go through with the sale\r\n  but increased the purchase price to $2.5 million and increased the earnest\r\n  money to $200,000.Â  Additionally, the Clardys had to accept the new offer and\r\n  send in earnest money by 5:00 p.m. on May 18, 2005.Â  According to Mike Clardy's\r\n  testimony, Bodolosky indicated he would make the corrections and initial them\r\n  on the existing contract.Â  Bodolosky left the amended contract at Long's\r\n  office.Â  Subsequently, Steve Clardy signed the amended contract at Long's\r\n  office on May 18, 2005.Â  Pursuant to the amended contract terms, the Clardys\r\n  paid $200,000 in earnest money by writing a check to Bodolosky's attorney,\r\n  rather than Bodolosky.Â  According to Michael Clardy's testimony, Long\r\n  instructed the Clardys to make the check out to his trust account, and the\r\n  Clardys issued a check to &quot;J. Scott Long Trust Account.&quot;Â  \r\nAfter the Clardys tendered the earnest money,\r\n  Bodolosky negotiated and entered into an Operating Agreement forming United\r\n  Land-Magnolia, LLC (Land-Magnolia).Â  Land-Magnolia took title to the Motels,\r\n  and Bodolosky testified he formed Land-Magnolia for the express purpose of\r\n  purchasing and developing the Motels he had just sold to the Clardys.Â Â Â \r\n  Accordingly, he attempted to rescind his contract with the Clardys.Â  Thus, on\r\n  June 2, 2005, Bodolosky sent Michael Clardy a letter claiming no purchase\r\n  agreement was in effect between the parties, and he had instructed his attorney\r\n  to return the earnest money.Â  Since his attempt to rescind the contract, Land-Magnolia\r\n  abandoned plans to develop the property and sold the property to Cypress Bay,\r\n  LLC.Â  \r\nThe Clardys filed suit against Bodolosky seeking\r\n  declaratory judgment, specific performance, breach of contract, and breach of\r\n  contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  Additionally, the Clardys sought attorney's\r\n  fees and costs.Â  In his answer, Bodolosky counterclaimed for malicious\r\n  prosecution and abuse of process; however, upon consent of the parties, the\r\n  trial court dismissed the counterclaims.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the Clardys complied with the\r\n  terms of the real estate contract &quot;as they understood them to be&quot; and\r\n  &quot;simply performed as they were instructed.&quot;Â  Thus, the trial court\r\n  held there was a meeting of the minds between the parties, and the Clardys\r\n  performed their pre-closing obligations.Â  Additionally, the trial court granted\r\n  the Clardys' request for specific performance and ordered Bodolosky to deliver\r\n  title of the real property to the Clardys.Â  Finally, the trial court found the\r\n  Clardys were entitled to $42,849.42 in attorney's fees and costs.Â  \r\nAfter the trial, Bodolosky filed a motion for reconsideration\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, where he asked the trial court to reconsider its\r\n  ruling in favor of the Clardys and instead find no contract existed between the\r\n  parties and find that there had not been a meeting of the minds.Â  In his\r\n  motion, Bodolosky requested the trial court specifically rule on whether the\r\n  hand-written provisions in the agreement were controlling over the pre-printed\r\n  provisions.Â  Additionally, Bodolosky asked the trial court to reconsider its\r\n  ruling awarding attorney's fees and argued the amount of attorney's fees\r\n  awarded was unreasonable.Â  The trial court denied Bodolosky's motion to\r\n  reconsider but, in its order, specifically ruled the hand-written provisions in\r\n  the agreement were controlling.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for specific performance is one in equity.Â  Campbell\r\n  v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 262-63, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2004). Â &quot;In\r\n  reviewing a proceeding in equity, this court may find facts based on its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Greer v. Spartanburg\r\n    Technical College, 338 S.C. 76, 79, 524 S.E.2d 856, 858 (Ct. App. 1999).Â \r\n  &quot;This broad scope of review does not require this court to ignore the\r\n  findings below when the trial court was in a better position to evaluate the\r\n  credibility of the witnesses.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n&quot;An\r\n  action to construe a contract is an action at law.&quot;Â  McGill v. Moore,\r\n  381 S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009).Â  &quot;A legal question in an\r\n  equity case receives review as in law.&quot;Â  Sloan v. Greenville County,\r\n  356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346 (Ct.

Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 654,\r\n  667 S.E.2d 7, 12 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;This court may correct errors of law\r\n  in both legal and equity actions.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Meeting of the Minds\r\nBodolosky contends the trial court erred in finding\r\n  there was a meeting of the minds and finding the contract was enforceable as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;South Carolina common law requires that, in\r\n  order to have a valid and enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the\r\n  minds between the parties with regard to all essential and material\r\n  terms of the agreement.&quot;Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382\r\n  S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989) (emphasis in original); see also Potomac\r\n    Leasing Co. v. Otts Mkt., Inc., 292 S.C. 603, 606, 358 S.E.2d 154, 156 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1987) (&quot;It is well settled in South Carolina that in order for there\r\n  to be a binding contract between parties, there must be a mutual manifestation\r\n  of assent to the terms.&quot;).Â  &quot;The necessary elements of a contract are\r\n  an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.&quot;Â  Roberts v. Gaskins,\r\n  327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In Player v.\r\n    Chandler, the South Carolina Supreme Court asserted:\r\n\r\n\tThe &quot;meeting of minds&quot; required to make a\r\n  contract is not based on secret purpose or intention on the part of one of the\r\n  parties, stored away in his mind and not brought to the attention of the other\r\n  party, but must be based on purpose and intention which has been made known or\r\n  which, from all the circumstances, should be known.Â  \r\n\r\n299\r\n  S.C. at 105, 382 S.E.2d at 894.\r\nHere, the trial court found there was a clear meeting\r\n  of the minds between the parties to the contract.Â  Further, the trial court\r\n  held the Clardys complied with the requirements of the contract as they\r\n  understood them to be and simply performed as they were instructed.Â  We believe\r\n  there was a meeting of the minds between Bodolosky and the Clardys regarding\r\n  the material terms of the contract.Â  Furthermore, evidence demonstrates the\r\n  necessary terms of the contract existed:Â  Bodolosky made and initialed a new\r\n  offer; the Clardys accepted the new offer; and the Clardys provided $200,000 in\r\n  earnest money as valuable consideration.Â  If writing an earnest money check\r\n  directly to Bodolosky was material to him, Bodolosky should have made it known\r\n  to the Clardys.Â  Id. at 105, 382 S.E.2d at 894 (stating the &quot;meeting\r\n  of minds&quot; requirement is not based on secret purpose or intention on the\r\n  part of one of the parties).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's\r\n  determination that a meeting of the minds occurred between the parties.\r\nII.Â  Specific Performance\r\nBodolosky next argues the trial court erred in finding\r\n  the Clardys were entitled to specific performance because the contract was\r\n  clear on its face.Â  Specifically, Bodolosky contends the contract required the\r\n  Clardys pay him directly rather than write a check to his attorney's trust\r\n  account because the parties did not intend to use an escrow agent.Â \r\n  Additionally, Bodolosky maintains the handwritten provisions in the contract\r\n  took precedence over the pre-printed provisions.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe trial court should only grant specific performance\r\n  if there is no adequate remedy at law and specific enforcement of the contract\r\n  is equitable between the parties.Â  Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 340 S.C.\r\n  98, 105-06, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000).Â  The Ingram court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn order to compel specific performance, a court of\r\n  equity must find: (1) there is clear evidence of a valid agreement; (2) the\r\n  agreement had been partly carried into execution on one side with the\r\n  approbation of the other; and (3) the party who comes to compel performance has\r\n  performed his or her part, or has been and remains able and willing to perform\r\n  his or her part of the contract.\r\n\r\nÂ Id. at 106, 531 S.E.2d at 291.Â  &quot;Mere inadequacy of consideration is not a\r\n  ground for refusing the remedy of specific performance; in order to be a defense,\r\n  the inadequacy must either be accompanied by other inequitable incidents, or\r\n  must be so gross as to show fraud.&quot;Â  Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C.\r\n  258, 264, 603 S.E.2d 625, 628 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Ingram, 340 S.C. at\r\n  106, 531 S.E.2d at 291).\r\n&quot;The\r\n  doctrine of substantial performance was conceived for the case where a\r\n  plaintiff's partial performance has already given to a defendant substantially\r\n  all that he bargained for and is of such a nature that it cannot be returned.&quot;Â  Coastal Seafood Co., Inc. v. Alcoa S.C., Inc., 298 S.C. 466, 467-68, 381\r\n  S.E.2d 502, 503 (Ct. App. 1989) (citing Diamond Swimming Pool Co. v. Broome,\r\n  252 S.C. 379, 384, 166 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1969)).Â  In Elliott v. Snyder,\r\n  the seller under an installment land sale contract brought an action for\r\n  rescission and cancellation thereof. Â 246 S.C. 186, 143 S.E.2d 374 (1965). Â The\r\n  buyer tendered an installment check which was returned marked &quot;drawn\r\n  against uncollected funds.&quot; Â Id. at 190, 143 S.E.2d at 376.Â  The\r\n  court held the seller was on notice that the check was not worthless but that\r\n  the funds drawn upon had not been collected at that time. Â Id. at 191,\r\n  143 S.E.2d at 376.Â  Further, the court found there was substantial compliance\r\n  with the terms of the contract sufficient to prevent forfeiture, and the seller\r\n  was not entitled to rescind. Id. \r\nWe find the Clardys satisfied the elements of the Ingram test:Â  there is evidence of a valid agreement, the Clardys performed their part\r\n  of the contract with Bodolosky's consent, and the Clardys remain able and\r\n  willing to buy the real estate.Â  Additionally, the Clardys substantially\r\n  performed their part of the contract and gave Bodolosky substantially all that\r\n  he bargained for even if we assume the contract required the Clardys write the\r\n  earnest money check directly to Bodolosky rather than to Long's trust account.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the express provisions of the contract do not make strict\r\n  compliance essential; therefore, substantial compliance is sufficient.Â  See Coastal Seafood, 298 S.C. at 468, 381 S.E.2d at 503 (&quot;Where a\r\n  contract, by its express provisions, makes strict compliance essential,\r\n  substantial performance is not sufficient.&quot;).Â  Â Â \r\nAdditionally, the trial court found Mike Clardy's\r\n  testimony provided &quot;the most credible explanation of the events\r\n  surrounding the execution and delivery of the earnest money check.&quot;Â  Mike\r\n  Clardy testified he called Long to find out how to make out the earnest money\r\n  check, and Long instructed him to make the earnest money check out to Long's\r\n  trust account.Â  Under our standard of review, this court can give deference to\r\n  the trial court's credibility determinations.Â  See Greer v.\r\n    Spartanburg Technical College, 338 S.C. 76, 79, 524 S.E.2d 856, 858 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999) (&quot;This broad scope of review does not require this court to ignore\r\n  the findings below when the trial court was in a better position to evaluate\r\n  the credibility of the witnesses.&quot;).Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial court's\r\n  decision to grant the Clardys specific performance based on the Ingram test, the Clardys' substantial compliance, and the trial court's credibility\r\n  determination.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nA.&nbsp; Decision to Award and\r\n  Amount\r\nFinally, Bodolosky alleges the trial court erred in awarding\r\n  attorney's fees and in finding the attorney's fees were reasonable as a matter\r\n  of law.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA party cannot recover attorney's fees unless\r\n  authorized by contract or statute.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 307,\r\n  486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997); see also Hegler v. Gulf Ins. Co., 270\r\n  S.C. 548, 549, 243 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1978) (&quot;As a general rule, attorney's\r\n  fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.&quot;).Â  The Jackson court asserted:Â  &quot;[C]ourt[s] should consider the following\r\n  six factors when determining a reasonable attorney's fee: (1) the nature,\r\n  extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the\r\n  case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation;\r\n  (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.&quot;Â  Id. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760.Â  Â &quot;On appeal, an\r\n  award for attorney's fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in\r\n  the record supports each factor.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, no statute authorizes an award of attorney's\r\n  fees; therefore, we must look to the contract for such remedy.Â  See Hegler,\r\n  270 S.C. at 549, 243 S.E.2d at 444 (&quot;No right to recover is here asserted\r\n  under any statute. Appellant then must recover, if at all, upon some\r\n  contractual right.&quot;).Â  Attorney's fees were authorized under the default\r\n  clause of the contract.Â  Specifically, the default clause provides:Â  &quot;If\r\n  Buyer or Seller fails to perform any covenant of this Agreement, the other may\r\n  elect to seek any remedy provided by law, including but not limited to attorney\r\n  fees and actual costs incurred . . . or terminate this Agreement with a five\r\n  day written notice.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court awarded the Clardys attorney's fees and costs for having to\r\n  initiate suit in order to carry Â­out the terms of their contract.Â  Further, the\r\n  trial court took the six factors of Jackson into account, and noting the\r\n  current action was for specific performance, considered:Â  1)Â  the nature, extent,\r\n  and difficulty involved in the action; 2) Â the reasonableness of attorney's\r\n  fees and costs; 3) affidavits outlining specific hours spent prosecuting the\r\n  case; and 4) the customary hourly rates charged in the area.Â Â  Additionally, the\r\n  trial court found the attorney's fees sought were well within the custom of our\r\n  practice area and reasonable under the specific facts of the present matter.Â  Finally,\r\n  the trial court noted the professional standing of the Clardys' counsel, and found\r\n  counsel's experience in similar matters was influential in securing the Clardys'\r\n  beneficial results.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly considered the six\r\n  factors set forth in Jackson in awarding $42,849.42 in attorney's fees\r\n  and costs, and we affirm the award.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Land-Magnolia's Obligation\r\n  to Pay\r\nAs\r\n  a final matter, Bodolosky argues the trial court erred in ordering Land-Magnolia\r\n  be responsible for the award of attorney's fees and costs because Bodolosky,\r\n  not Land-Magnolia, entered into the land sale contract with the Clardys.Â  Bodolosky\r\n  maintains there is no privity of contract because Land-Magnolia was not a party\r\n  to Bodolosky's real estate contract with the Clardys.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  one not in privity of contract with another cannot maintain an action against\r\n  him in breach of contract, and any damage resulting from the breach of a\r\n  contract between the defendant and a third party is not, as such, recoverable\r\n  by the plaintiff.&quot;Â  Windsor Green Owners Ass'n v. Allied Signal, Inc.,\r\n  362 S.C. 12, 17, 605 S.E.2d 750, 752 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Bob Hammond\r\n    Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. Co., 312 S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  However, with proof of a valid assignment of contract, an\r\n  assignee can be bound to certain equities of the contract.Â  See Welling\r\n    v. Crosland, 129 S.C. 127, 137, 123 S.E. 776, 780 (1924) (internal citation\r\n  omitted) (&quot;The assignee of a contract is bound by the same equities which\r\n  existed between the original parties to the contract, having purchased with a\r\n  full knowledge of the state of things.&quot;).Â  Â Â \r\nHere, Land-Magnolia took title to the Motels; however,\r\n  Bodolosky never assigned Land-Magnolia his real estate contract with the\r\n  Clardys.Â  Though Land-Magnolia was a necessary party to the present action, it\r\n  was not a party to the real estate contract at issue.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Land-Magnolia cannot now be responsible for attorney's fees given there is no\r\n  privity of contract.Â  Rather, Bodolosky alone should incur attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Moreover, the trial court had the authority to award attorney's fees\r\n  and costs based on the language of the Clardy contract, and Land-Magnolia did\r\n  not have the benefit of participating in the negotiation of the contract at\r\n  issue.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in finding Land-Magnolia was obligated\r\n  to pay attorney's fees pursuant to Bodolosky's contract with the Clardys even\r\n  though Land-Magnolia was an active participant in the events and decisions\r\n  leading to the present action.Â  Accordingly, the trial court's finding that Land-Magnolia\r\n  is responsible for attorney's fees and costs is therefore reversed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in ordering Bodolosky carry out the terms of his real\r\n  estate contract with the Clardys and deliver title of real property to them.Â \r\n  Additionally, we find there was a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; between the\r\n  parties to warrant enforcement of the contract.Â  Finally, we believe the trial\r\n  court properly awarded attorney's fees but find the trial court erred in\r\n  holding Land-Magnolia responsible for any portion of attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  The decision of the trial court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4541","title":"State v.

Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  &quot;When ruling\r\n  on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the\r\n  existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  A defendant is\r\n  entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the\r\n  offense charged.Â  Id.Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, an\r\n  appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\r\n  most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  If there is any direct evidence or\r\n  any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt\r\n  of the accused, the appellate court must find the case was properly submitted\r\n  to the jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFirst-degree\r\n  burglary is defined in section 16-11-311 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (2003):\r\n\r\n  A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if\r\n    the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime\r\n    in the dwelling, and either:\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or\r\n    in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n  \r\n    (a) is armed with a\r\n      deadly weapon or explosive; or\r\n    (b) causes physical\r\n      injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime; or\r\n    (c) uses or\r\n      threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or\r\n    (d) displays what is\r\n      or appears to be a knife, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or\r\n      other firearm; or\r\n  \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; the burglary is committed by a person with a prior\r\n    record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a\r\n    combination of both; or\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n\r\nEntering\r\n  a building without consent is defined as entering &quot;without the consent of\r\n  the person in lawful possession&quot; or entering &quot;using deception,\r\n  artifice, trick, or misrepresentation to gain consent to enter from the person\r\n  in lawful possession.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310 (2003).\r\nWhile\r\n  &quot;lawful possession&quot; has not been defined by South Carolina statutes\r\n  or case law, burglary has historically developed as a crime against the\r\n  possession of the dwelling.Â  For instance, State v. Brooks, 277 S.C.\r\n  111, 112, 283 S.E.2d 830, 831 (1981), defines burglary as &quot;a crime against\r\n  possession, not against property.&quot;Â  See also State v. Miller,\r\n  225 S.C. 21, 26, 80 S.E.2d 354, 356 (1954) (&quot;The offense of housebreaking\r\n  is an offense against possession.&quot;) (citing State v. Alford, 142\r\n  S.C. 43, 44, 140 S.E. 261, 261 (1927) (&quot;Burglary and arson are crimes\r\n  against possession and not against property.&quot;)).Â  Furthermore, &quot;[t]he\r\n  law of burglary is primarily designed to secure the sanctity of one's home,\r\n  especially at nighttime when peace, solitude[,] and safety are most desired and\r\n  expected.&quot;Â  Brooks, 277 S.C. at 112, 283 S.E.2d at 831.Â \r\n  &quot;Thus, at the heart of burglary law is protection of the individual and\r\n  family from unlawful intrusion while home at night.&quot;Â  Id. at 113,\r\n  283 S.E.2d at 831.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  an early discussion of the possessory interest rather than ownership interest\r\n  with regards to a burglary indictment is found in State v. Trapp, 17\r\n  S.C. 467 (1882).Â  Trapp was convicted of burglary and challenged his conviction\r\n  on the ground that the indictment listed a woman as the owner of the house he burglarized,\r\n  rather than her husband, the legal owner.Â  Id. at 469.Â  Our supreme\r\n  court stated there are two reasons for requiring the ownership of the house to\r\n  be stated in the indictment for burglary:Â  (1)Â  &quot;For the purpose of\r\n  showing on the record that the house alleged to have been broken into, was not\r\n  the dwelling house of the accused, inasmuch as one cannot commit the offense of\r\n  burglary by breaking into his own house&quot; and (2) &quot;For the purpose of\r\n  so identifying the offence, as to protect the accused from a second prosecution\r\n  for the same offence.&quot;Â  Id. at 470.Â  The court went further to say:\r\n\r\n  It is\r\n    true that burglary is an offence against the habitation of some other\r\n    person, but it is very clear that it is not essential that such habitation\r\n    shall be alleged to be that of the person who actually occupies-inhabits-the\r\n    house at the time it is broken into, for there are quite a number of cases in\r\n    which indictments alleging ownership in the master have been sustained, where\r\n    the house was, at the time, not occupied by the master, but by some other\r\n    person as his servant or agent.\r\n\r\nId. at 471.Â  Likewise, Trapp discussed an earlier\r\n  case from Michigan, Snyder v. The People, 26 Mich. 106 (1872), where the\r\n  element &quot;dwelling of another&quot; was at issue.Â  Trapp, 17 S.C. at\r\n  472.Â  There, the court determined even when the perpetrator of the property\r\n  crime of arson is married to the individual with sole legal ownership, the arsonist\r\n  may be found guilty of arson if the property is not his abode.Â  Id.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  a few South Carolina cases have addressed burglary in the context of a person\r\n  with either permission to be in the dwelling, or a person who formerly had\r\n  permission to be in the dwelling.Â  For example, State v. Bee, 29 S.C.\r\n  81, 83, 6 S.E. 911, 912 (1888), provided a servant, sleeping in an adjacent\r\n  room, can commit burglary in the dwelling house by &quot;unlatching his\r\n  master's door, and entering his apartment&quot; with the intent to commit a\r\n  felony.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, in State v. Howard, 64 S.C. 344,\r\n  348-49, 42 S.E. 173 (1902), our court stated while one cannot commit burglary\r\n  of his own dwelling house, when a servant enters a latched or fastened door at\r\n  night for the purpose of committing a felony, it amounts to burglary.Â  Id.,\r\n  42 S.E. at 175.\r\nMost\r\n  recently, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the denial of a directed\r\n  verdict in State v. Coffin, 331 S.C. 129, 132, 502 S.E.2d 98, 99\r\n  (1998).Â  In Coffin, the defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary[4] after entering his girlfriend's home and stabbing her to death.Â  Id. at\r\n  132, 502 S.E.2d at 98.Â  The victim's roommate testified the victim was the only\r\n  other person with a key to the residence, her name was the only one signed on\r\n  the lease, and Coffin's identification was &quot;affixed pursuant to a clause\r\n  requiring that 'visitors' be approved.&quot;Â  Id. at 132, 502 S.E.2d at\r\n  99.Â  The Court affirmed the trial court's denial of Coffin's directed verdict\r\n  motion, finding the evidence &quot;supports the inference [Coffin] was a guest\r\n  in [the victim's] home and she was entitled to terminate [his] lawful\r\n  possession by evicting him as she did before the stabbings occurred.&quot;Â  Id. at 132, 502 S.E.2d at 99.Â  The Court held the evidence presented a jury\r\n  question as to whether Coffin &quot;was in lawful possession of the mobile home\r\n  at the time of the stabbings.&quot;[5]Â  Id.\r\nCourts\r\n  in other states have made similar conclusions when interpreting the issue of\r\n  lawful possession.Â  See State v. Harold, 325 S.E.2d 219, 222\r\n  (N.C. 1985) (&quot;The defendant's emphasis on the issue of ownership is\r\n  misplaced . . . the inquiry relevant to this element of the crime is whether\r\n  the premises is the dwelling of another, not whether it is owned by another.&quot;) (emphasis in original); Murphy v. State, 234 S.E.2d\r\n  911, 914 (Ga. 1977) (&quot;'Ownership', as that term is used in property law,\r\n  is not an essential ingredient to proving that the premises entered were 'the\r\n  dwelling house of another' within the meaning of our burglary law . . . [a]ll\r\n  that is required was that . . . it was occupied.&quot;).\r\nHere,\r\n  while Singley lawfully owned 12.5% of the dwelling, we do not believe his\r\n  ownership of title gave him a possessory interest recognized under the burglary\r\n  statute.Â  Under the statute, it is clear that Singley's mother, not Singley,\r\n  was the person in lawful possession.Â  This is most notably evidenced by\r\n  Singley's acknowledgement of his mother's right to occupancy and possession by\r\n  his acquiescence to her demand for him to vacate the house in April 2005.Â \r\n  Additionally, Singley's mother owned 75% of the dwelling, and Singley's mode of\r\n  entrance through a window implies his entry was without consent.\r\nThus,\r\n  we believe the trial court did not err in denying Singley's directed verdict\r\n  motion because the State offered sufficient evidence to prove all the elements\r\n  of burglary, including establishing Singley's mother as the sole lawful\r\n  possessor of the dwelling when the burglary occurred.Â  Additionally, the State\r\n  proved Singley entered unlawfully and without his mother's consent.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Singley's conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Singley and his brother each owned 12.5% of the\r\n  house, and his mother owned 75% of the house.Â  \r\n[2] Singley's mother testified at trial that he told her\r\nhe entered the house by crawling through a bedroom window.Â  \r\n[3] S.C.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4542\r\nHeard February 4, 2009 â€“ Filed May 6, 2009Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Michael Davis Moore, of Ridgeville, for Appellant.\r\n        J. ReavesÂ  McLeod, of Walterboro, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.:Â  This is an appeal of a directed verdict\r\n  in a premises liability lawsuit.Â  Plaintiff James Padgett alleged he sustained\r\n  injuries after stepping into a hole on the Colleton County Courthouse grounds.Â \r\n  After Padgett presented his case, the County moved for a directed verdict,\r\n  which the trial judge granted, holding (1) the dangerous condition causing\r\n  Padgett's injuries was open and obvious, and (2) there was no proof of an\r\n  agency relationship between the County and the party who had allegedly created\r\n  the hazard.Â  Padgett appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  December 9, 2003, Padgett went to the Colleton County Courthouse to check on a\r\n  deed.Â  Upon arriving, Padgett walked down a cement walkway to the back door of\r\n  the Courthouse, where he saw Richard Jenkins, who had come to the Courthouse to\r\n  make a child support payment.Â  Padgett and Jenkins did not know each other.\r\nUpon discovering\r\n  the back door was locked, Padgett followed Jenkins around the side of the\r\n  Courthouse.Â  Instead of taking the sidewalk, the two took a shorter well-worn\r\n  path on the grounds that had been made by other visitors to the Courthouse.Â  Although\r\n  Jenkins &quot;noticed the ground was kind of messed up,&quot; he continued\r\n  walking.Â  When he reached the side door of the Courthouse, he noticed Padgett\r\n  had fallen. \r\nPadgett testified\r\n  he fell when he suddenly stepped into a hole that was about eight inches deep. Â He\r\n  landed on his backside, initially feeling disoriented.Â  Jenkins helped Padgett\r\n  up and informed Courthouse security about the accident.\r\nOn January 23,\r\n  2004, Padgett filed this action against Colleton County seeking damages under\r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  In his complaint, Padgett alleged the\r\n  County was negligent, grossly negligent, willful and wanton in (1) failing to\r\n  warn the public about the hazard causing his injuries, (2) failing to place\r\n  warning signs, (3) failing to fence off the holes on the Courthouse grounds,\r\n  (4) failing to supervise its employees, and failing to use the degree of care and\r\n  caution that a reasonably prudent person would have used under similar\r\n  circumstances.Â  He also maintained the County, by and through its employees,\r\n  created and maintained a dangerous condition.Â  \r\nIn its answer filed\r\n  April 27, 2004, the County denied liability and by way of affirmative defense\r\n  alleged (1) Padgett's own negligence was the sole cause of his injuries; and\r\n  (2) under the Tort Claims Act, the County was not liable for losses resulting\r\n  from acts or omissions of anyone other than its own employees.Â  \r\n The matter was\r\n  tried before a jury from December 11 through December 13, 2006.Â  \r\nAt trial, Jenkins\r\n  testified that, although the area in which Padgett fell was not barricaded, it\r\n  was &quot;pretty rough,&quot; with &quot;soil turned upside down&quot; and\r\n  &quot;roots sticking up.&quot;Â  Nevertheless, Jenkins also stated that, even\r\n  though there was a sidewalk, the path they took was shorter and well-worn.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Padgett maintained they were unable to take the walkway because\r\n  cement had been freshly poured; therefore, he had no choice but to walk on the\r\n  grounds.Â  He also testified that he did not see any holes and the terrain was\r\n  smooth.\r\nJenkins did not\r\n  actually see Padgett fall and at trial did not give definitive information as\r\n  to the cause of the accident.Â  While on the stand, however, he acknowledged\r\n  stating in a deposition that the hole in which Padgett had stepped was a\r\n  &quot;nice size for a foot to fall in, just enough for a foot&quot; and about\r\n  the depth of a flower pot.Â  In addition, Padgett testified that he had fallen\r\n  into a hole that was &quot;about the size of post hole diggers . . . and . . . full\r\n  of soft sand and straw.Â  He further testified that the ground where he fell was\r\n  smooth and perfectly level.&quot;\r\nAccording to\r\n  Patricia Grant, the Colleton County Clerk of Court, shrubbery was being removed\r\n  from the Courthouse grounds in 2003 for security reasons.Â  Grant could not\r\n  recall seeing any signs prohibiting pedestrian traffic on the grass.Â  She also\r\n  testified that she did not notice any of the walkways were disabled.\r\nKarla Daddieco, the\r\n  Administrative Services Director for Colleton County in 2003, testified that in\r\n  October 2003 the County entered into a contract with Jeffrey Simmons Lawn Care\r\n  for general lawn maintenance.Â  Simmons also agreed to an addendum to the\r\n  contract under which he would provide for removal of stump shrubbery at the\r\n  Courthouse for $400.Â  Daddieco stated the County considered the agreement to be\r\n  a small contract and did not require Simmons to be bonded or have liability\r\n  insurance.Â  At the prompting of counsel for the County, the court admonished\r\n  Padgett's attorney out of the jury's presence that references to liability\r\n  insurance was inappropriate. When the jurors returned to the courtroom, the\r\n  judge again instructed them to disregard the reference to insurance.Â  \r\nConsistent\r\n  with Grant's testimony, Daddieco also maintained none of the sidewalks were\r\n  closed down on December 9, 2003.Â  Daddieco further testified that she had no\r\n  personal knowledge that Simmons had used any caution tape in connection with\r\n  the landscaping work.Â  She had no opinion as to whether Simmons would have been\r\n  responsible for doing this if it had been required; however, she acknowledged\r\n  giving deposition testimony that it was her assumption that caution tape would\r\n  be used in connection with landscaping projects undertaken by Simmons.Â  She\r\n  also admitted to having seen people on the lawn of the Courthouse and testified\r\n  that the facilities director would have had the responsibility for making sure\r\n  Simmons used caution tape. Â Daddieco further acknowledged the Courthouse was a\r\n  place of public accommodation for all individuals. \r\nAt the close of\r\n  Padgett's case-in-chief, the County moved for a directed verdict, arguing (1)\r\n  there was no actionable negligence on its part that was the proximate cause of\r\n  Padgett's injuries and Padgett's own negligence was the proximate cause of his\r\n  injuries; (2) the alleged hazard causing Padgett's injuries was an obvious\r\n  defect; and (3) to the extent that the hole was a latent defect, the County\r\n  could not be liable for Padgett's injuries because it could not have discovered\r\n  it through reasonable inspection.Â  \r\nThe trial judge\r\n  directed a verdict for the County, finding (1) the condition causing Padgett's\r\n  injuries was an open and obvious defect for which no warning was necessary from\r\n  the County; and (2) there was no evidence connecting the County to Simmons in\r\n  terms of any kind of agency liability.Â  Padgett then made a motion to alter or\r\n  amend the judgment and a motion for a mistrial or in the alternative for a new\r\n  trial.Â  Following the denial of these motions, Padgett filed this appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp; Did Padgett present sufficient\r\n  evidence to create a jury issue as to whether the condition causing him to fall\r\n  was open and obvious?\r\nII.&nbsp; Notwithstanding evidence that the\r\n  condition causing Padgett's fall was open and obvious, was the County subject\r\n  to liability based on evidence that it should have anticipated the harm that\r\n  resulted from the condition?\r\nIII. Did the trial judge err in basing\r\n  his decision to direct a verdict for the County on the fact that Simmons was an\r\n  independent contractor? \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  court should deny a directed verdict motion &quot;when the evidence yields more\r\n  than one inference or its inference is in doubt.&quot;Â  Sabb v. South\r\n    Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  &quot;When\r\n  reviewing the trial court's ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, we must\r\n  employ the same standard as the trial courtâ€”that is, we must consider the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;Â  Fickling\r\n    v. City of Charleston, 372 S.C. 597, 603, 643 S.E.2d 110, 113 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007), cert. denied, October 31, 2007.Â  In reviewing a directed verdict,\r\n  the appellate court &quot;must resolve whether it would be reasonably\r\n  conceivable to have a verdict for a party opposing the motion under the facts\r\n  as liberally construed in the opposing party's favor.&quot;Â  Pye v. Estate\r\n    v. Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. The Open and Obvious Nature of the\r\n  Hazard\r\nPadgett\r\n  argues the trial judge, in finding the hole in which he fell was an open and\r\n  obvious hazard, improperly weighed competing evidence on this issue.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Reasonable\r\n  care on the part of [a] possessor [of land]Â  . . . does not ordinarily require\r\n  precautions, or even warning, against dangers which are known to [a] visitor,\r\n  or so obvious to him that he may be expected to discover them.&quot;Â  Restatement\r\n    (Second) of Torts Â§ 343A cmt. e (1965) (quoted in Creech v. S.C.\r\n      Wildlife and Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 31, 491 S.E.2d 571, 574 (1997)). \r\nAs the County\r\n  pointed out in its brief, the trial judge, in granting its directed verdict\r\n  motion, found that no reasonable juror could dispute the physical evidence\r\n  presented, namely, a photograph of the area that was taken shortly after the\r\n  accident occurred.Â  In ruling on the motion, the trial judge described his\r\n  observations in detail, noting as follows:\r\n\r\n  As you\r\n    move on over toward those steps, you can see that the land is not perfectly\r\n    smooth and level.Â  It is disturbed.Â  There are roots out.Â  It does appear very\r\n    clearly as if the ground had recently been disturbed.Â  There are some leaves on\r\n    the ground, but it's hard for me to imagine that the leaves that I see there\r\n    are enough to cover up the hole that Mr. Padgett says he stepped in.Â  But more\r\n    importantly, there's no way that those leaves covered up the hole that I can\r\n    see that's about four feet past the place where Mr. Padgett stepped. \r\n  So\r\n    considering all of the testimony and all of the evidence that related to Mr.\r\n    Padgett's version of the way that ground looked, in my view the property out\r\n    there is â€“ the fact that there are holes there and are dangerous places to walk\r\n    is open and obvious.Â  \r\n\r\nThe County also\r\n  cites Legette v. Piggly Wiggly, Inc., 368 S.C. 576, 629 S.E.2d 375 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996), for the proposition that &quot;[t]estimony that contradicts undisputed\r\n  physical evidence generally lacks probative value.&quot;Â  Id. at 580,\r\n  629 S.E.2d at 377.Â  Legette, however, is distinguishable from the\r\n  present case.Â  Whereas testimony from the plaintiff in Legette as to\r\n  whether she had seen mats and warning signs about moisture on the floor of the\r\n  defendant's store was equivocal at best, Padgett never wavered in his\r\n  statements that the ground on which he fell was smooth and the sidewalk was\r\n  unavailable for pedestrian traffic.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we do not agree with the finding that the photograph conclusively established\r\n  the defect was open and obvious. Although Padgett submitted the photograph, he\r\n  also asserted in his brief the photograph showed the hole was partially covered,\r\n  and we find it significant that the County did not respond to this assertion.Â  See Patterson v. I.H. Servs., Inc., 295 S.C. 300, 304, 368 S.E.2d 215, 218 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988) (noting that, notwithstanding the circumstances suggesting that the\r\n  respondent's testimony was implausible, &quot;neither objective nor scientific\r\n  evidence offered by [the appellant] nor common knowledge render inherently\r\n  incredible [the respondent's] testimony&quot;).\r\nII. The County's Anticipation of the\r\n  Danger\r\nPadgett\r\n  further contends that even if the hole was open and obvious, the County was\r\n  still subject to liability based on evidence that it should have anticipated\r\n  that harm that could be caused by the defect.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Callander\r\n  v. Charleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C. 123, 406 S.E.2d 361 (1991), the\r\n  supreme court noted:Â  &quot;The traditional 'no duty to warn of the obvious'\r\n  rule has been modified in many jurisdictions to hold that an owner is liable\r\n  for injuries to an invitee, despite an open and obvious defect, if the owner\r\n  should anticipate that the invitee will nevertheless encounter the condition,\r\n  or that the invitee is likely to be distracted.&quot;Â  Id. at 125, 406\r\n  S.E.2d at 362.Â  Following this trend, the court adopted the Restatement\r\n    (Second) of Torts Â§ 343(A) (1965), which provides that &quot;[a] possessor\r\n  of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any\r\n  activity or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious to them,\r\n  unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or\r\n  obviousness.&quot;Â  Callander, 305 S.C. at 126, 406 S.E.2d at 362.Â  Quoting\r\n  comment (f) to this section, the court further explained that &quot;an owner\r\n  may be required to warn the invitee, or take other reasonable steps to protect\r\n  him, if the 'possessor has reason to expect that the invitee's attention may be\r\n  distracted, so that he will not discover what is obvious, . . . or fail to\r\n  protect himself against it.' &quot;Â  Id., 406 S.E.2d at 362-63 (quoting Restatement\r\n    (Second) of Torts Â§ 343(A) cmt. (f).\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in the recent case of Hancock v. Mid-South Management Co., the supreme\r\n  court, in reversing the grant of summary judgment in a premises liability\r\n  action arising from the plaintiff's fall in the defendant's parking lot, stated:Â \r\n  &quot;While a parking lot's state of disrepair may be considered open and\r\n  obvious, a jury could determine that Respondent should have anticipated that\r\n  such a condition may cause an invitee to fall and injure themselves.&quot;Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Management Co., ___ S.C. ___, ___, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803\r\n  (2009).Â  Although the present case concerns a directed verdict, we see no\r\n  reason why the evidence Padgett presented, especially (1) Jenkins' testimony\r\n  that the path he and Padgett took was well-worn, (2) Daddieco's acknowledgement\r\n  that she had seen people on the lawn of the Courthouse grounds, and (3)\r\n  Padgett's testimony that the sidewalk was unavailable, cannot give rise to a\r\n  reasonable inference that the County should have anticipated that individuals\r\n  using the services at the Courthouse could be harmed by the ongoing landscaping\r\n  operations.Â \r\n\r\nIII. Simmons' Status as an Independent\r\n  Contractor\r\nFinally,\r\n  Padgett argues the trial judge incorrectly ruled the County could not be held\r\n  liable for his injury because the individual who created the dangerous\r\n  condition resulting in his injury was an independent contractor.Â  It was\r\n  Padgett's position at trial and on appeal that the County was ultimately\r\n  responsible for ensuring the caution tape was used where active landscaping was\r\n  taking place, regardless of who was supposed to put it up.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder the South\r\n  Carolina Code Tort Claims Act, a governmental entity is not liable for a loss\r\n  resulting from &quot;an act of or omission of a person other than an employee.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(20) (2005).Â  This section, however, &quot;would not\r\n  operate to exonerate [a governmental entity] of liability for its own conduct.&quot;Â  Greenville Mem'l Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 247, 391 S.E.2d\r\n  546, 548 (1990).\r\nThe\r\n  County's sole argument in response to this assertion is that Padgett did not\r\n  include this issue in his post-trial motions and therefore failed to preserve\r\n  this issue for appeal.Â  A review of the trial judge's ruling on this issue and\r\n  the colloquy immediately preceding it, however, indicates Padgett's argument\r\n  regarding agency liability was both raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court.Â  See Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365, 550 S.E.2d 910,\r\n  913 (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;Post-trial motions are not necessary to preserve\r\n  issues that have been ruled upon at trial; they are used to preserve those that\r\n  have been raised to the trial court but not ruled upon.&quot;).[1]Â  \r\nAt trial, Padgett\r\n  argued the County's common law duty to supervise Simmons &quot;does not end\r\n  because they signed a contract with Mr. Simmons.&quot;Â  He further correctly pointed\r\n  out that Daddieco acknowledged that the County facilities director would have\r\n  been responsible for making sure caution tape was in place when and where it\r\n  was necessary.Â  There was also evidence that the County was responsible for\r\n  removing caution tape when it was no longer required in an area and an\r\n  acknowledgment that the Courthouse was a place of public accommodation for all\r\n  individuals.Â  The evidence, then, when construed in Padgett's favor, could have\r\n  supported a finding by the jury that even if the County was not liable for any\r\n  act of omission on Simmons' part, the County was negligent in discharging its\r\n  own duties to adequately maintain the Courthouse premises and this negligence created\r\n  a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury resulting from Simmons' landscaping\r\n  operations.Â  Cf. Greenville Mem'l Auditorium, 301 S.C. at 247,\r\n  391 S.E.2d Â at 549 (holding the defendant could not successfully assert the\r\n  plaintiff's injuries resulted from the wrongful criminal act of a third party\r\n  &quot;where by very basis upon which appellant is claimed to be negligent is\r\n  that appellant created a reasonably foreseeable risk of such third party\r\n  conduct&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe agree with\r\n  Padgett that the trial judge erred in directing a verdict for the County in\r\n  this action; therefore, we reverse the directed verdict and remand the matter\r\n  to the trial court for further proceedings.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In directing a verdict for the County, the trial\r\n  judge ruled in pertinent part:Â  &quot;Certainly the County has some duty to\r\n  oversee the work that its contractors do, but the situation here is\r\n  distinguishable from the situations that you have pointed out to me in some of\r\n  the other cases.&quot;Â  The &quot;other cases&quot; cited by Padgett's attorney\r\n  in opposition to the County's directed verdict motion included Madison v.\r\n    Babcock Center, 371 S.C. 123, 638 S.E.2d 650 (2006) (holding the defendants\r\n  owed a common law duty to supervise a mentally retarded resident and provide\r\n  her with appropriate care) and Vaughan v.

McQueeney, Jr., of Charleston,\r\n  for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: In this\r\n  medical malpractice action, Robert Guinan appeals the master-in-equity's[1] grant of defendants' summary judgment motion, arguing\r\n  substantial issues of discovery remained unresolved and Dr. Avinash Gupta's\r\n  (Gupta) testimony implicated the defendants in deviations from the standard of\r\n  care. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGuinan\r\n  suffered from neck, shoulder, and other pain, and received epidural injections\r\n  of pain medication in his cervical spine on March 13, 2002, from Dr. Philip\r\n  James Zitello (Zitello).Â  After the injection, Guinan began experiencing chest\r\n  pains and weakness in his legs.Â  As a result, Guinan contacted Dr. Gaston O.\r\n  Perez (Perez), his family physician.Â  Perez examined Guinan, administered some\r\n  medications, and instructed Guinan to go to the emergency room at Hilton Head\r\n  Regional Medical Center (Hilton Head Regional).[2]Â \r\n  Perez contacted the emergency room and explained Guinan's relevant medical\r\n  history.Â  Additionally, Perez contacted Zitello, and Zitello agreed to meet\r\n  Perez and Guinan at the emergency room.Â  \r\nPerez\r\n  admitted Guinan into the emergency room and ordered a neurology consult.Â  Dr.\r\n  Harvinder Kohli (Kohli) performed the neurology consult and ordered the\r\n  administration of a blood thinner to treat a suspected spinal cord occlusion or\r\n  clot.Â  Kohli called Memorial Health University Medical Center (Memorial Health)\r\n  in Savannah, Georgia, to discuss the case with a neurosurgeon and spoke with Dr.\r\n  James Lindley (Lindley).[3]Â \r\n  Lindley suspected Guinan's symptoms were related to a hematoma (or a bleed),\r\n  rather than a clot.Â  As a result, the blood thinner was discontinued, and\r\n  Guinan was transported to Memorial Health.Â  Upon arrival, Guinan was given a\r\n  MRI, which revealed the presence of a hematoma in Guinan's cervical and\r\n  thoracic spine.Â  Lindley successfully evacuated the hematoma.Â  \r\nGuinan\r\n  brought a medical malpractice action against Hilton Head Regional, Kohli, and\r\n  Zitello.Â  Guinan alleged Hilton Head Regional:Â  (1) failed to properly diagnose\r\n  the hematoma; (2) failed to properly administer drugs; (3) administered drugs\r\n  known to be or should have known to be dangerous to Guinan; (4) failed to warn\r\n  Guinan of the danger presented by the drugs; (5) failed to require Zitello to\r\n  be present in the emergency room; (6) failed to obtain a neurological consult;\r\n  (7) failed to exercise the degree of care required of physicians in an\r\n  emergency room setting; (8) failed to have proper diagnostic equipment\r\n  available; and (9) failed to immediately transfer Guinan to Memorial Health for\r\n  emergency care.Â  As to Kohli, Guinan asserted he:Â  (1) failed to properly\r\n  diagnose the hematoma; (2) failed to properly treat Guinan; (3) increased the\r\n  harm to Guinan by administering drugs he knew or should have known would harm\r\n  Guinan; (4) failed to consult a neurosurgeon prior to administering the blood\r\n  thinner; (5) failed to exercise the degree of care required by the circumstances;\r\n  and (6) failed to immediately transfer Guinan to Memorial Health for emergency\r\n  care.Â  Lastly, Guinan claimed Zitello:Â  (1) failed to properly administer the\r\n  epidural injection; (2) failed to recognize the symptoms of a failed epidural\r\n  injection; (3) failed to warn and inform Guinan of the symptoms of an epidural\r\n  injection and warn Guinan of possible paralysis; (4) failed to attend to Guinan\r\n  at the emergency room; (5) failed to see that Guinan was immediately sent to\r\n  surgery; (6) failed to exercise the degree of care required of physicians in\r\n  the profession; and (7) failed to warn and inform Guinan of the risks of an\r\n  epidural hematoma and other risks of the epidural injection.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  first scheduling order in this case was dated September 7, 2005, and provided\r\n  an April 15, 2006, discovery deadline.Â  On May 26, 2006, an amended scheduling\r\n  order was issued extending the deadline to June 1, 2006.Â  After a motions\r\n  hearing on July 12, 2006, a final scheduling order was issued extending the\r\n  deadlines for another forty days.Â  The scheduling order also stated the\r\n  defendants could not file motions for summary judgment until the expiration of\r\n  the discovery deadlines.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 2, 2006, after the discovery deadlines had expired, the master heard\r\n  the defendants' motion for summary judgment.Â  Sixteen days later, the master\r\n  issued an order granting the defendants' motion.Â  The master found Gupta\r\n  testified he was not an expert in the field of neurology or emergency medicine;\r\n  had never been involved in the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with spinal hematoma; had no criticisms of the nursing staff at the emergency room, or of\r\n  Kohli; stated Kohli administered the standard of care relative to the care and\r\n  treatment of Guinan; did not have any material experience in an emergency room\r\n  in the United States; was unwilling to comment on the performance of emergency\r\n  room physicians; and did not offer any opinion that any act of the defendants\r\n  was the proximate cause of any of Guinan's injuries.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the master found the time for discovery had expired,\r\n  and Guinan had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the master granted defendants' motion for summary judgment because Guinan was\r\n  without expert testimony to create a genuine issue of material fact with\r\n  respect to his claims of medical negligence against the defendants.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nStandard of Review \r\n\r\n&quot;Since\r\n  it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment 'should be cautiously invoked so that\r\n  no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual\r\n  issues.'&quot;Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112,\r\n  410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (quoting Watson v. S. Ry. Co., 420 F. Supp.\r\n  483, 486 (D.S.C. 1975)).Â  An appellate court reviews the grant of summary\r\n  judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.Â  David v.\r\n    McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â  The\r\n  circuit court should grant summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of\r\n  fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed\r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  &quot;A court\r\n  considering summary judgment neither makes factual determinations nor considers\r\n  the merits of competing testimony; however, summary judgment is completely\r\n  appropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth facts that remain\r\n  undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.&quot;Â  David, 367\r\n  S.C. at 250, 626 S.E.2d at 5.Â  Summary judgment &quot;must not be granted until\r\n  the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, the nonmoving party must demonstrate the likelihood that further\r\n  discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is 'not\r\n  merely engaged in a &quot;fishing expedition.&quot;'&quot;Â  Dawkins v.\r\n    Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003) (quoting Baughman,\r\n  306 S.C. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 544) (internal citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Incomplete Discovery\r\nGuinan\r\n  contends discovery was incomplete because Hilton Head Regional failed to\r\n  produce x-rays until the day of the summary judgment hearing and he had not\r\n  received the emergency telephone records from Hilton Head Regional or the phone\r\n  company.[4]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn Dawkins\r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 71, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439-40 (2003), our supreme\r\n  court rejected Dawkins' &quot;argument that summary judgment was premature\r\n  because they did not have a full and fair opportunity for discovery.&quot;Â  A\r\n  party claiming summary judgment is premature because they have not been\r\n  provided a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery must advance a good\r\n  reason why the time was insufficient under the facts of the case, and why further\r\n  discovery would uncover additional relevant evidence and create a genuine issue\r\n  of material fact.Â  Id. at 71, 580 S.E.2d at 439-40.\r\nHere,\r\n  Guinan alleges the phone records would reveal how long the blood thinner was\r\n  administered, and the x-rays would prove Guinan did not have any vascular\r\n  problem early on, leaving epidural hematoma as the only possible diagnosis.Â \r\n  However, the length of time the blood thinner was administered had no adverse\r\n  effect on Guinan's condition.Â  Accordingly, we believe the master did not err\r\n  in hearing the defendants' summary judgment motion because the discovery\r\n  deadlines had expired and Guinan was afforded a full and fair opportunity to\r\n  conduct discovery.Â  Moreover, on appeal, Guinan fails to demonstrate further discovery\r\n  would uncover additional relevant evidence or create a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact.\r\nII.&nbsp; Gupta's Testimony \r\nGuinan\r\n  maintains the master erred in granting the defendants' general summary judgment\r\n  motion when Gupta's testimony &quot;clearly implicated&quot; the defendants in\r\n  deviations from the standard of care.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  physician commits malpractice by not exercising that degree of skill and\r\n  learning that is ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the\r\n  profession in good standing acting in the same or similar circumstances.Â \r\n  Additionally, medical malpractice lawsuits have specific requirements that must\r\n  be satisfied in order for a genuine factual issue to exist.Â  Specifically,\r\n  a plaintiff alleging medical malpractice must provide evidence showing (1) the\r\n  generally recognized and accepted practices and procedures that would be\r\n  followed by average, competent practitioners in the defendants' field of\r\n  medicine under the same or similar circumstances, and (2) that the defendants\r\n  departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards. Â Also, the plaintiff must\r\n  show that the defendants' departure from such generally recognized practices\r\n  and procedures was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's alleged injuries and\r\n  damages.Â  The plaintiff must provide expert testimony to establish both the\r\n  required standard of care and the defendants' failure to conform to that\r\n  standard, unless the subject matter lies within the ambit of common knowledge\r\n  so that no special learning is required to evaluate the conduct of the\r\n  defendants.Â  \r\n\r\nDavid v. McLeod Reg'l Med.\r\n  Ctr.,&nbsp; 367 S.C. 242, 247-48, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 1, 3-4&nbsp;(2006) (internal citations omitted).\r\nAdditionally, &quot;[o]nce employed, a physician must\r\n  attend the case as long as it requires attention, unless the relation of\r\n  physician and patient is ended by mutual consent or is revoked by the dismissal\r\n  of the physician.Â  A physician cannot abandon a case without reasonable notice\r\n  to the patient.&quot;Â  Johnston v. Ward, 288 S.C. 603, 610, 344 S.E.2d\r\n  166, 170 (1986) (internal citations omitted), overruled on other grounds by Spahn v. Town of Fort Royal, 330 S.C. 168, 172-174, 499 S.E.2d 205,\r\n  207-208 (1998).\r\nDr. Gupta\r\n  testified he was an expert in anesthesiology and pain management, but stated he\r\n  did not consider himself an expert in emergency medicine or neurology.Â \r\n  Additionally, Gupta asserted he did not have much exposure to emergency rooms\r\n  in the United States.Â  Â Gupta stated the only issue in the case was the delay\r\n  in diagnosis.Â  Instead of indicating which doctor was at fault for the delay in\r\n  diagnosis, Gupta discusses the course of action he would have taken, but does\r\n  not state any of the defendants deviated from the standard of care.Â  However,\r\n  Gupta stated every minute is critical to a patient developing paralysis, and\r\n  the prognosis is better if surgery is performed eight to twelve hours after the\r\n  onset of symtoms.Â  When asked directly who caused the delay in diagnosis, Gupta\r\n  responded:\r\n\r\n\tDr.\r\n  Perez did call Dr. Zitello prior to him sending [Guinan] to the emergency\r\n  room.Â  In fact, as far as I know, he called either immediately after seeing the\r\n  patient in his office, or he called even before.Â  I do not exactly know the\r\n  sequence of events.Â  But if Dr. Zitello is â€“ or anybody who is performing this\r\n  particular procedure is told that a patient is having weakness in the legs and\r\n  is having severe pain in the chest radiating to the upper extremities, that\r\n  itself is enough to immediately flag â€“ put a red flag in the injectionist that\r\n  this is cervical hematoma.Â  And Dr. Zitello should have picked up the diagnosis\r\n  even on the telephone itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gupta next stated he\r\n  had never been involved with diagnosing spinal hematoma.\r\nWith\r\n  regard to Hilton Head Regional's vicarious liability through its emergency room\r\n  nursing personnel, Gupta testified he did not have any criticisms. Â Additionally,\r\n  during direct examination at his deposition, Gupta stated he had no criticisms\r\n  of Kohli's performance.Â  On cross-examination, Kohli's attorney asked:Â \r\n  &quot;Can I take it then that Dr. Kohli, in so far as you're concerned, adhered\r\n  to the standard of care relative to the care and treatment he rendered to Mr.\r\n  Guinan?&quot;Â  Dr. Gupta responded:Â  &quot;That's correct.&quot;Â  \r\nGupta testified he did not have any criticisms of how\r\n  Zitello administered the cervical epidural steroid injection.Â  However, when\r\n  asked what he would have done if he had been in Zitello's position, he replied:\r\n\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  If I get a call from a physician regarding just the chest pain itself, I would\r\n  rather tell them to go ahead with the cardiac even to work.Â  But I would\r\n  certainly ask him if the patient is having any shooting pain in the upper\r\n  extremities, or is he developing any weakness in the leg.Â  In that event, I\r\n  would tell the physician who's calling me that I will be right over, and I will\r\n  see the patient myself.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  And that would be the standard of care?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  That would be my standard of care.\r\n\tQ:Â \r\n  You think that would be the standard of care for someone in your profession\r\n  that's doing this?\r\n\tA:Â \r\n  I think so.\r\n\r\nWe find summary judgment was proper because Guinan\r\n  failed to provide evidence, through his expert witness, showing the defendants\r\n  departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards of average,\r\n  competent practitioners in their field of medicine under the same or similar\r\n  circumstances.Â  The most damaging portion of Gupta's testimony is his statement\r\n  that Zitello deviated from Gupta's personal standard of care; however, we do\r\n  not find that testimony sufficient to withstand summary judgment because it\r\n  does not state Zitello deviated from the generally accepted standard of\r\n  care.Â  More importantly, Guinan failed to show defendants' alleged departure\r\n  from the generally recognized practices and procedures was the proximate cause\r\n  of his injuries.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the master-in-equity is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â The master-in-equity was sitting as a special\r\n  circuit judge.\r\n[2] Tenant HealthSystems of Hilton Head, Inc., and Hilton\r\n  Head HealthSystems, P.A., d/b/a Hilton Head Regional Medical Center.\r\n[3]Â  Kohli called Lindley on or about the time the blood\r\n  thinner was being administered.Â  The exact timing and duration of the\r\n  administration of the blood thinner is highly debated between Guinan and the\r\n  defendants.Â  However, while the administration of a blood thinner to a person\r\n  with internal bleeding could cause problems, there is no evidence the blood\r\n  thinner had a negative effect on Guinan.Â  Coagulation studies of his blood both\r\n  before and after the administration of the blood thinner indicate Guinan's\r\n  blood was normal.Â  Additionally, Guinan's expert witness, Gupta, did not\r\n  testify to the contrary.Â  Accordingly, the exact amount of blood thinner\r\n  actually administered is without consequence.Â  \r\n[4] Hilton Head Regional asserts in its respondent's\r\n  brief that the discovery issue of whether Guinan could name an additional\r\n  expert is unpreserved for review because it was not raised to the master.Â \r\n  However, the issue was raised to the master during the summary judgment motion\r\n  hearing, and ruled upon in the master's order.Â  While this issue is preserved\r\n  for our review, it appears to be waived on appeal.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (stating an issue on appeal must be argued in the appellate\r\n  brief).Â  Guinan does not argue discovery was incomplete because he was not\r\n  allowed to name an additional expert witness in his appellate brief.Â  The only\r\n  specific arguments regarding incomplete discovery revolve around the phone\r\n  records and x-rays.Â  However, if the court were to determine the additional expert\r\n  witness testimony was not abandoned on appeal, we believe the argument would\r\n  ultimately fail because the discovery deadlines had expired, Guinan was\r\n  afforded a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery, and Guinan failed on\r\n  appeal to demonstrate further discovery would uncover any additional relevant\r\n  evidence or create a genuine issue of material fact.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4544","title":"State v.

Â Officer Futch did not advise Corley\r\n  of his Miranda rights[1] prior to questioning him during the traffic stop.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  the State sought to admit the crack cocaine into evidence, Corley objected\r\n  asserting it was the result of an illegal search and seizure.Â  Corley moved to\r\n  suppress the evidence asserting two prongs.Â  First, he argued, under State\r\n    v. Fowler, 322 S.C. 263, 471 S.E.2d 706 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996), there was insufficient reason to believe he had committed any\r\n  crime other than the traffic violation, and the inquiry from the officer went\r\n  beyond the purpose of the initial stop with this further detention violating\r\n  his fourth amendment rights under State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  Second, Corley maintained, assuming arguendo there was sufficient reason to\r\n  believe he had committed another crime, the inquiries of the officer amounted\r\n  to custodial interrogation.Â  He therefore asserted because he was not advised\r\n  of his Miranda rights, his statements and the evidence obtained as a result\r\n  thereof should be suppressed.Â  The State argued Williams was\r\n  distinguishable because in that case, the traffic stop was completed before the\r\n  questioning, as the officer had already returned the defendant's license and\r\n  registration and issued the citation.Â  The State further distinguished Fowler,\r\n  arguing the facts were stronger to support reasonable suspicion of drug\r\n  activity in this case.Â  The State also maintained it was not necessary that\r\n  Corley be advised of his Miranda rights because the questioning occurred\r\n  during a routine traffic stop.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court determined it was not going to get into whether there was probable\r\n  cause for the traffic stop because, based on the testimony of the officer, the\r\n  real reason for the stop was the suspected drug activity.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  court found the question was whether the officer had probable cause to stop\r\n  Corley in consideration of what he observed at the house in regard to drug\r\n  activity.Â  Noting that Officer Futch was conducting surveillance on a drug\r\n  house, the time was 2:50 in the morning, and Corley went to the back of the\r\n  house and stayed for approximately two minutes before leaving, the court\r\n  determined there was probable cause to stop Corley on that basis and therefore\r\n  denied Corley's motion to suppress.Â Â Â  Counsel for Corley then requested a\r\n  ruling on the Miranda issue.Â  The trial court ruled the questioning was\r\n  pursuant to an investigation into the drug activity and Miranda was\r\n  therefore not implicated.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  submitting a drug analysis into evidence over Corley's objection, the State\r\n  rested.Â  Corley presented no evidence in his defense.Â  Based on the testimony\r\n  of the officer, Corley's stipulation as to chain of custody and the validity of\r\n  the chemist's report, and the denial of the motion to suppress, the trial court\r\n  found Corley guilty as charged.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are\r\n  bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\r\n  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in\r\n  determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).\r\n  In Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases, our review is limited to\r\n  determining whether any evidence supports the trial court's finding.Â  State\r\n    v. Banda, 371 S.C. 245, 251, 639 S.E.2d 36, 39 (2006).Â  Upon such review,\r\n  an appellate court may reverse only when the trial court's decision is clear\r\n  error.Â  State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 95, 623 S.E.2d 840, 846 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  Under the &quot;clear error&quot; standard, the appellate court\r\n  will not reverse a trial court's finding of fact simply because it may have\r\n  decided the case differently.Â  Id. at 96, 623 S.E.2d at 846.Â  Additionally,\r\n  &quot;[a]ppellate review of whether a person is in custody is confined to a\r\n  determination of whether the ruling by the trial judge is supported by the\r\n  record.&quot;Â  State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 583, 582 S.E.2d 407, 409\r\n  (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nCorley\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence seized because\r\n  (1) a custodial interrogation was conducted by the investigating officer\r\n  without advising Corley of his Miranda rights, (2) the officer detained\r\n  Corley longer than was necessary to write the traffic ticket thereby eliciting\r\n  an incriminating statement, and (3) the arresting officer did not have a\r\n  sufficient factual basis to stop Corley independently for alleged drug activity\r\n  where he never observed a drug transaction. Because we find there is evidence\r\n  to support the trial court's ruling that Officer Futch had probable cause to\r\n  stop Corley and investigate for drug activity, we find no error.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he\r\n  right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\r\n  against unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot;Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â Â  &quot;The\r\n  Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all contact between police and citizens,\r\n  but is designed 'to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by\r\n  enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.'&quot; INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 215 (1984) (quoting United States v.\r\n    Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3081, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116\r\n  (1976)).Â  \r\nThe stopping of a vehicle and the\r\n  detention of its occupants constitutes a seizure and implicates the Fourth\r\n  Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â Â  Delaware\r\n    v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653-54 (1979).Â  &quot;Therefore, an automobile\r\n  stop implicates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches\r\n  and seizures, imposing a standard of 'reasonableness' upon the exercise of\r\n  discretion by state law enforcement officials.&quot;Â  State v. Banda,\r\n  371 S.C. 245, 252, 639 S.E.2d 36, 40 (2006).Â  &quot;A police officer may stop\r\n  and briefly detain and question a person for investigative purposes, without\r\n  treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when the officer has a reasonable\r\n  suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of probable cause for arrest,\r\n  that the person is involved in criminal activity.&quot;Â  State v. Woodruff,\r\n  344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;The term\r\n  'reasonable suspicion' requires a particularized and objective basis that would\r\n  lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the circumstances must be\r\n  considered as a whole.Â  Id.Â  If the officer's suspicions are confirmed\r\n  or further aroused, the stop then may be prolonged and the scope enlarged.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Generally, the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable when the police\r\n  have probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred.Â  Banda,\r\n  371 S.C. at 252, 639 S.E.2d at 40.\r\nIn this case, it is undisputed Officer Futch acted lawfully in\r\n  stopping Corley's automobile for the traffic violation.Â  Additionally, a minor\r\n  traffic-violation arrest will not be rendered invalid by the fact it was\r\n  &quot;a mere pretext for a narcotics search.&quot;Â  Arkansas v. Sullivan,\r\n  532 U.S. 769, 772 (2001);Â  Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 812-13\r\n  (1996);Â  accord United States v. Stachowiak, 521 F.3d 852, 855 (8th\r\n  Cir. 2008).Â  Thus, the subjective intentions of an officer &quot;play no role\r\n  in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.&quot;Â  Banda, 371\r\n  S.C. at 252 n.3, 639 S.E.2d at 40 n.3.Â  Corley contends, however, Officer Futch\r\n  did not have reasonable suspicion to investigate for a possible drug\r\n  violation.Â  He argues the circumstances of his case, including his presence in\r\n  an area of suspicious activity but without observation of a drug transaction,\r\n  rendered his stop and search unlawful pursuant to State v. Fowler, 322\r\n  S.C. 263, 471 S.E.2d 706 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  We disagree.\r\nIn analyzing investigative detentions, courts employ the standard\r\n  articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio, 392\r\n  U.S. 1 (1968). Â State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 192, 519 S.E.2d 786, 789\r\n  (1999). Â &quot;Under this standard, 'a policeman who lacks probable cause but\r\n  whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular person has\r\n  committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime, may detain that person\r\n  briefly in order to investigate the circumstances that provoke that\r\n  suspicion.'&quot; Id. (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420,\r\n  439 (1984)). Thus, the police may briefly detain and question a person upon a\r\n  reasonable suspicion, short of probable cause for arrest, that the person is\r\n  involved in criminal activity. State v. Abrams, 322 S.C. 286, 288, 471\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 717 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The scope and duration of a Terry detention must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances that\r\n  rendered its initiation proper. State v. Rodriquez, 323 S.C. 484, 493, 476\r\n  S.E.2d 161, 166 (Ct. App. 1996). Â &quot;Typically, this means that the officer\r\n  may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity\r\n  and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's\r\n  suspicions.&quot;Â  Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 439.Â  However, the detainee is\r\n  not obliged to respond and unless his answers provide probable cause to arrest\r\n  him, he must then be released.Â  Id. at 439-40. \r\nIn Fowler, two police officers were on a routine patrol of\r\n  a &quot;high drug area&quot; when Fowler was observed coming from the front\r\n  yard of a suspected drug house.Â  Some fifteen minutes later, the same officers\r\n  saw Fowler again.Â  Suspecting he might be carrying a weapon, they stopped him\r\n  and patted him down, finding a large knife and a significant sum of cash in his\r\n  pockets.Â  After he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, a jail strip-search\r\n  revealed Fowler had crack cocaine on his person.Â  Fowler moved to suppress the\r\n  evidence.Â  During the suppression hearing, the officers testified their\r\n  suspicions were aroused based on Fowler walking in a suspicious manner,\r\n  appearing as if he was trying to elude them and cutting back behind some houses.\r\n  Â Additionally, the officers knew Fowler had a prior drug conviction and was\r\n  known to carry weapons. Â Fowler, 322 S.C. at 265, 471 S.E.2d at 707.Â \r\n  The trial court granted Fowler's motion finding the stop and frisk were\r\n  unconstitutional.Â  Id. at 266, 471 S.E.2d at 707-08.Â  This court\r\n  affirmed, holding the facts did not support the State's position that the\r\n  officers had an articulable suspicion Fowler was involved in criminal activity,\r\n  noting the officers did not see a drug transaction take place nor observe Fowler\r\n  throw anything down, but basically made broad generalizations about his\r\n  demeanor as they observed him leaving the curtilage of a suspected drug house.Â  Id. at 266-67, 471 S.E.2d at 708.\r\nWe find Fowler to be distinguishable.Â  Although both\r\n  involved areas of high drug activity, the house in Fowler was only a suspected drug house while the residence in this case was a known drug house where\r\n  several cases had been made and search warrants executed.Â  Additionally, while\r\n  observing this known drug house, the officer observed Corley walk to the rear\r\n  of the residence, remain for a very short period of time, and then promptly\r\n  return to his automobile.Â  This all occurred in the early morning hours.Â \r\n  Finally, in Fowler the officers acknowledged they stopped Fowler to do a\r\n  field interview as part of a pro-active mission to prevent crime and that\r\n  Fowler, who lived only three blocks from where he was first seen that night,\r\n  &quot;did not do anything to make the police believe he was armed or involved\r\n  in drug activity.&quot;Â  Id. at 266, 471 S.E.2d at 707.Â  To the\r\n  contrary, Officer Futch testified he was suspicious Corley was involved in\r\n  illegal drug activity based on his observations of him at the known drug\r\n  house.Â  \r\nThe trial court concluded Officer Futch had probable cause to stop\r\n  Corley and investigate for possible drug activity.Â  In considering the\r\n  circumstances as a whole, and in light of our standard of review limiting us to determining whether any evidence supports the\r\n  trial court's finding, we find no clear error in the trial court's\r\n  determination that Officer Futch had probable cause to stop Corley and\r\n  investigate based on his suspicion of drug activity.\r\nCorley\r\n  also contends the trial court\r\n  erred in failing to suppress the evidence seized from his automobile because he\r\n  was subjected to a custodial interrogation without the benefit of having been\r\n  advised of his Miranda rights.Â  He argues this was not a routine traffic\r\n  stop, but that he was stopped for the purpose of being questioned about illegal\r\n  drug activity.Â  Corley asserts, because the police officer possessed his\r\n  license and registration, he was not free to leave, and that this case is\r\n  factually no different from an officer questioning a suspect about a crime for\r\n  which he has probable cause to arrest the suspect.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the law is clear that the police may, in an investigative\r\n  detention, briefly detain and question a person upon a reasonable\r\n  suspicion, short of probable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in\r\n  criminal activity.Â  As previously noted, there is evidence of record to support\r\n  the trial court's determination Officer Futch had a reasonable suspicion, short\r\n  of probable cause for arrest, that Corley was involved in criminal activity\r\n  such that his brief detention and questioning was proper.Â  We find it of no\r\n  import that the detention was accomplished through a traffic stop.Â  It is\r\n  undisputed the officer acted lawfully in stopping the car for failure to use a\r\n  turn signal.Â  See Banda, 371 S.C. at 252, 639 S.E.2d at 40\r\n  (holding police acted lawfully in stopping car displaying stolen license tag in\r\n  spite of evidence the officers were more interested in apprehending a drug\r\n  target).Â  Further, the United States Supreme Court has observed, even though\r\n  few motorists would feel free to either disobey a police directive to pull over\r\n  or to leave the scene of a traffic stop without permission to do so,\r\n  &quot;persons temporarily detained pursuant to [ordinary traffic] stops are not\r\n  'in custody' for the purposes of Miranda,&quot; and &quot;[o]nly if the\r\n  motorist is detained 'to a degree associated with formal arrest' will he be\r\n  entitled to the Miranda protections for in-custody interrogations.&quot;Â Â  United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126, 130 (4th Cir. 1998) (quoting Berkemer,\r\n  468 U.S. at 440).Â  &quot;Even 'drawing weapons, handcuffing a suspect, placing\r\n  a suspect in a patrol car for questioning, or using or threatening\r\n  to use force does not necessarily elevate a lawful stop into a custodial arrest\r\n  for Miranda purposes.'&quot;Â  Id. at 132 (quoting U.S. v.\r\n    Leshuk, 65 F.3d 1105, 1109-10&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1995)).Â  Thus, even though a\r\n  motorist in a routine traffic stop may be detained and is not free to leave,\r\n  such a motorist is not &quot;in custody&quot; for Miranda purposes.Â  Id. at 130-31.\r\nWe disagree with Corley's assertion that this situation could not\r\n  be considered a routine traffic stop because the real reason for the stop was\r\n  for him to be questioned regarding possible drug activity.Â  Our courts make no\r\n  distinction based upon the subjective intentions of an officer in making a\r\n  traffic stop, and evidence that the police were more interested in apprehending\r\n  a drug target does not factor into a probable cause analysis in an otherwise\r\n  valid stop.Â Â  Banda, 371 S.C. at 252 n.3, 639 S.E.2d at 40 n.3; Arkansas\r\n    v. Sullivan, 532 U.S. at 772. We see no distinction between this situation,\r\n  where the officer's suspicions arose prior to the stop, and one in which those\r\n  suspicions arose during the stop.Â  As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\r\n  observed in United States v. Sullivan, routine traffic stops are\r\n  analogous to Terry stops, where no Miranda warnings are required,\r\n  and &quot;only when the motorist is detained to an extent analogous to an\r\n  arrest&quot; are Miranda warnings required.Â  United States v.\r\n    Sullivan, 138 F.3d at 131.Â  While, without question, Officer Futch's\r\n  intentions were to stop Corley and question him regarding possible drug\r\n  activity, the detention of Corley at the time of questioning was not to such an\r\n  extent as to be analogous to an arrest, but was akin to a Terry stop,\r\n  for which no Miranda warnings are required.Â  As in United States v.\r\n    Sullivan, there is no indication here that the officer said anything or\r\n  conducted himself in a way to suggest Corley was under arrest or was being\r\n  detained as if he were under arrest.Â  Id. at 132.Â  Accordingly, we hold\r\n  Corley was not in custody for purposes of Miranda while being questioned\r\n  by Officer Futch.\r\nIn light of our disposition, we need not address Corley's\r\n  remaining issue that Officer Futch seized Corley for longer than was necessary\r\n  for the traffic stop, amounting to an illegal detention under State v.\r\n    Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  See Â Â  Futch\r\n      v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues\r\n  when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's denial of\r\n  Corley's motion to suppress.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A statement obtained as a result of custodial\r\n  interrogation is inadmissible unless the suspect was advised of and voluntarily\r\n  waived his rights.Â Â  Â Miranda v.\r\n    Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4545","title":"State v.

After work, she\r\n  drove to Tennant's grandmother's house[2] to pick up her children.Â  When she arrived, Tennant exited the house carrying a\r\n  brown paper bag.Â  He approached the driver's door window of her car, began\r\n  talking to her about the divorce, and again stated he wanted to give her\r\n  something.Â  Victim informed him she did not want to talk, and she just wanted\r\n  to pick up her children and go home.Â  Eventually, Tennant got into the\r\n  passenger seat of her vehicle and began searching in his brown paper bag.Â  He\r\n  began questioning her about an alleged relationship she had with another man,\r\n  pulled a cord out of his brown paper bag, and strangled her until she lost\r\n  consciousness.Â  \r\nVictim regained\r\n  consciousness, and realized she was in the trunk of her car, which was moving.Â \r\n  After she kicked the speakers out of the trunk, Tennant stopped the car.Â  He\r\n  duct-taped her hands together after pulling her out of the trunk, but she\r\n  convinced him to remove the tape.Â  After removing the duct tape, he told Victim\r\n  if she ran he would stab her in the legs with his knife.Â  Tennant told her that\r\n  he did not want a divorce, apologized, and stated he did not mean for things to\r\n  go this far.Â  He also told Victim that he knew how to choke her without killing\r\n  her and he wanted to have sex with her.Â  She told Tennant she would have sex\r\n  with him.[3]Â Â \r\n  Tennant removed Victim's clothes, laid her on the ground beside her vehicle,\r\n  and had sex with her.Â  Afterwards, he helped her get up and put her clothes\r\n  back on.Â  Next, Tennant took Victim back to his grandmother's house and\r\n  instructed her to go to the back bedroom.Â  He told her she was not free to\r\n  leave until the next morning when she took the children to school. Â Overnight, they\r\n  had sex again.Â Â Â  \r\nThe next morning,\r\n  while driving her children to school, Victim flagged down a police officer to\r\n  report the assault.Â  As a result, Tennant was arrested on November 27, 2001.Â \r\n  When the police arrested him, he had overdosed on his psychotic medication.Â \r\n  Additionally, the police found a note[4] (the suicide note) that read:\r\n\r\n  [Victim]\r\n    you told . . . the police that I raped you and you know I did not.Â  You told me\r\n    that you wanted to make love to me from the first day I got out of jail.Â  And\r\n    you hadn't already because you said I might try and use it against you in our\r\n    divorce.Â  I asked you if you wanted to make love to me and you said yes, and\r\n    started kissing me.\r\n\r\nTennant was charged with\r\n  kidnapping, assault and battery with intent to kill, first degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, violating an order of protection, and possession of a firearm\r\n  or knife during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nBefore trial, Tennant submitted a written motion and\r\n  offer of proof pursuant to South Carolina Code Section 16-3-659.1 (2003), commonly\r\n  referred to as the Rape Shield Statute.Â  He sought to introduce evidence of Victim's\r\n  sexual conduct, including their sexual history.Â  Specifically, he contended the\r\n  proffer outlined the unusual dynamics of their sexual relationship.Â  The\r\n  proffer contained statements of when and how Tennant and Victim met,\r\n  allegations of her promiscuity, allegations of her involvement in adultery,\r\n  statements that Tennant and Victim had a sexual relationship, allegations her\r\n  promiscuity led to his drug and alcohol problems, allegations she would\r\n  self-inflict wounds during arguments and blame them on Tennant, letters he\r\n  wrote to his doctor and the solicitor, and allegations he could not sexually\r\n  satisfy Victim.[5] Â He maintained this information was admissible for the following reasons:Â  (1)\r\n  the information pertained to Victim's motive to make false allegations because she\r\n  was angry he exposed her affair and he was divulging details of her lifestyle;\r\n  (2) the information was relevant to Schwartz-Watts's expert opinion that\r\n  Tennant was mentally ill and depressed at the time of the incident because Victim's\r\n  allegations cannot be separated from the nature of their sexual relationship;\r\n  and (3) much of the conduct involved adultery, which is not excluded by the\r\n  Rape Shield Statute.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, prior to Victim's testimony, the State sought to limit Victim's cross-examination\r\n  pursuant to the Rape Shield Statute.Â  The State conceded Tennant could ask Victim\r\n  if she committed adultery and, if she denied any adultery, he could prove\r\n  specific instances of adulterous conduct.Â  However, the State maintained the\r\n  written proffer addressing Victim's sexual history was not relevant.Â \r\n  Additionally, the State argued the proffer contained large amounts of hearsay\r\n  that was both irrelevant and inadmissible.Â  Tennant argued the Rape Shield\r\n  Statute did not apply to conduct between Victim and Tennant, or to Victim's\r\n  adulterous conduct.Â  The trial court determined the Rape Shield Statute allowed\r\n  very few instances of the victim's sexual conduct with the defendant or any\r\n  other individual.Â  Accordingly, the trial court ruled Tennant's proffered\r\n  evidence was not admissible.[6]Â \r\n  Tennant requested that the court take up the issue again &quot;either at the\r\n  end of [Victim's] direct [testimony] or at the end of her testimony\r\n  altogether.&quot;Â  The trial court replied:Â  &quot;Yes.Â  I mean, if I hear\r\n  something different or if you think you hear something different, then we'll do\r\n  it.&quot;Â  Nevertheless, Tennant did not attempt to elicit any testimony\r\n  regarding the excluded proffered evidence during Victim's cross-examination,\r\n  nor did he re-assert the issue of the evidence's admissibility at the close of\r\n  her direct-examination or testimony.Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  at trial, Tennant unsuccessfully sought to introduce the suicide note.Â  Tennant\r\n  argued its exclusion hindered him from effectively presenting a defense of\r\n  consent.Â  The State maintained the note was self-serving hearsay, and objected\r\n  to its introduction.\r\nLater, during Victim's\r\n  testimony, she testified she received a letter from Tennant (the response\r\n  letter) while he was in jail in response to a letter she sent him.Â  The\r\n  response letter apologized for &quot;everything that happened back in\r\n  November,&quot; discussed religion, and expressed his happiness that she was\r\n  reading her Bible.Â  It also asked for her forgiveness and friendship after his\r\n  release from jail.Â  After the response letter was entered into evidence, Tennant\r\n  again proffered the suicide note.Â  He cited Rule 106, SCRE, and argued the\r\n  State introduced a writing to show he was remorseful and asking for\r\n  forgiveness, and pursuant to Rule 106, the suicide note should be considered at\r\n  the same time.Â  The State contended the suicide note was not actually a suicide\r\n  note, and was &quot;not a note in response, or a writing that has any way, a\r\n  connection to [the response] letter.&quot;Â  Additionally, the State argued the\r\n  suicide note had nothing to do with the response letter and the two were not\r\n  contemporaneous.Â  Moreover, the State asserted the suicide note was a\r\n  self-serving statement that attempted to prove consent.Â  The trial court ruled\r\n  the suicide note inadmissible.\r\nNext, Tennant\r\n  argued the suicide note was not hearsay because it dealt with his state of\r\n  mind.Â  He maintained the fact the note was self-serving was not determinative\r\n  if it was being offered to prove state of mind.Â  Addressing the State's\r\n  arguments, he contended all the notes were found together.Â  Additionally, he\r\n  asserted the suicide note should be introduced because it was written the day\r\n  of the assault, noting &quot;he talked about the events of that day.&quot;Â  In\r\n  sum, he believed the note should be introduced to depict his state of mind at\r\n  the time of the assault.Â  Again, the State asserted the suicide note was not\r\n  contemporaneous because it was probably written thirty-six hours after the\r\n  attack and the response letter was written approximately nine months afterwards\r\n  on August 5, 2002.Â  The trial court again ruled the suicide note was\r\n  inadmissible.[7]Â  \r\nAfter the State\r\n  rested, Tennant moved to proffer testimony by Schwarts-Watts, a forensic\r\n  psychiatrist.Â Â  Schwartz-Watts testified primarily about Tennant's mental\r\n  illness and drug abuse.Â  She opined he was suffering from mental illness when\r\n  he attacked Victim.Â  Schwartz-Watts also stated someone with his mental illness\r\n  would interpret Victim's visiting him in jail as an indication that their\r\n  relationship was ongoing.Â Â  Additionally, Schwartz-Watts testified Tennant did\r\n  not believe he could sexually satisfy Victim:Â  &quot;It was his opinion that he\r\n  could not please her . . . [b]ecause she was very experienced.Â  She had been\r\n  with other people and she had certain preferences, which he didn't\r\n  share.&quot;Â  Schwartz-Watts maintained his inability to please Victim\r\n  contributed to his poor self-esteem.Â  On cross-examination, in response to a\r\n  question concerning Tennant's criminal responsibility, she testified:\r\n\r\n  There\r\n    is no evidence that any [of] the psychotic beliefs that he has would have\r\n    prevented him from knowing right from wrong.Â  Like if you ask Mr. Tennant if it\r\n    is wrong to rape your wife, he would absolutely know that the rape or beating\r\n    of them was wrong.Â  And there has never been any record that I can tell that he's\r\n    had recurring impulses to harm, rape, or kill his wife.Â  And so, in my opinion,\r\n    on that day in time even though he was sick he knew the difference between\r\n    right and wrong.Â  And he certainly was not having any recurring impulses to\r\n    rape or harm his wife.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when\r\n  specifically asked by the trial court if she could testify to any information\r\n  regarding consent in this matter as a defense, Schwartz-Watts stated:Â \r\n  &quot;No.Â  That would certainly â€“ that would be outside the realm of my\r\n  expertise.Â  My opinion would probably be limited to what his mental state was,\r\n  could he perceive for the mental illness and his own personality are based on\r\n  the relationship between him and the victim.Â  I couldn't say.&quot;\r\nFollowing the proffer, the trial court questioned the\r\n  relevance of Schwartz-Watts's testimony, and Tennant maintained her testimony\r\n  was relevant to his state of mind and the State's burden of proving criminal\r\n  intent beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Additionally, he contended Schwartz-Watts's\r\n  testimony contradicted Victim's testimony that she did not go see him while he\r\n  was imprisoned and she maintained the relationship was over.Â  Further, the\r\n  contradictory testimony was relevant to the nature of the relationship between Victim\r\n  and Tennant.Â Â  As a result, the trial court recalled Schwartz-Watts, and asked\r\n  her if she had an opinion as an expert regarding whether Tennant believed Victim\r\n  consented to the sexual encounter.Â Â  Schwartz-Watts replied:Â  &quot;Certainly he\r\n  believes and he reports to me that he believes it was consensual, but you know,\r\n  how much of that comes from mental illness and how much of that comes from his\r\n  being rational, I don't know.&quot;Â  Upon further examination by Tennant,\r\n  Schwartz-Watts testified there was no evidence &quot;that because of a psychiatric\r\n  disorder&quot; Tennant could have perceived Victim to have consented.Â  The\r\n  trial court excluded Schwartz-Watts's testimony in its entirety.\r\nThe jury convicted\r\n  Tennant of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, and ABHAN.Â  The\r\n  trial court sentenced Tennant to two concurrent terms of thirty years'\r\n  imprisonment, suspended upon the service of twenty years' imprisonment and five\r\n  years probation for the criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping convictions.Â \r\n  Additionally, the trial court sentenced Tennant to a concurrent term of ten\r\n  years for the ABHAN conviction.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard of Review \r\n\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  &quot;The\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369\r\n  S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\n  controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The trial court is given\r\n  broad discretion in ruling on questions concerning the relevancy of evidence,\r\n  and its decision will be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 35, 538 S.E.2d 248, 256\r\n  (2000).Â  \r\n&quot;To\r\n  warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the\r\n  complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting\r\n  prejudice.&quot;Â  State v. White, 372 S.C. 364, 373, 642 S.E.2d 607, 611\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  To prove prejudice, the complaining party must show there is\r\n  a reasonable probability &quot;that the jury's verdict was influenced by the\r\n  challenged evidence or lack thereof.&quot;Â  Id. at 374, 642 S.E.2d at\r\n  611.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Doctor\r\n  Schwartz-Watts's Testimony\r\nTennant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit Doctor Schwartz-Watts's\r\n  expert testimony about his mental illness because her testimony was probative\r\n  of his state of mind and his defense of consent, and effectively impeached Victim\r\n  on the issue of whether or not she visited him in jail.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expert's\r\n  testimony are matters within the trial court's sound discretion.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. White, 372 S.C. 364, 373, 642 S.E.2d 607, 611 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Before\r\n  expert testimony is admitted, the trial court must determine if the evidence is\r\n  relevant, reliable, and helpful to the jury.Â  Id. at 374, 642 S.E.2d at\r\n  612.Â  &quot;If the evidence is reliable, and relevant, the trial [court] should\r\n  determine if the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its\r\n  prejudicial effect.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nTennant asserts the\r\n  exclusion of Schwartz-Watts's testimony was prejudicial because Victim's\r\n  credibility was critical and Schwartz-Watts's testimony proved Victim was lying\r\n  about their relationship.Â  Tennant also claims the trial court's refusal to admit\r\n  Schwartz-Watts's testimony violated his right to present a complete defense.Â  However,\r\n  the trial court determined Schwartz-Watts's testimony was not relevant to the\r\n  issues at trial.Â  She testified primarily about Tennant's mental illness, but\r\n  ultimately opined there was no evidence his psychiatric disorder caused his\r\n  belief that Victim consented to the sexual encounter.Â  Moreover, Schwartz-Watts\r\n  testified she believed Tennant was suffering from his mental illness at the\r\n  time of the assault, but did not state the mental illness prevented him from\r\n  being able to distinguish right from wrong.\r\nFurthermore, when\r\n  directly asked by the trial court if she could provide an expert opinion on\r\n  consent, Schwartz-Watts replied in the negative.Â  As to Tennant's argument that\r\n  her testimony effectively impeached Victim, the record indicates\r\n  Schwartz-Watts's basis for thinking Victim visited him at jail came from his\r\n  medical records and statements.Â  Moreover, Victim did not unequivocally state\r\n  she did not visit Tennant in jail, but rather stated she did not remember\r\n  visiting him.Â  \r\nLastly, Tennant has\r\n  not effectively established the trial court abused its discretion by finding\r\n  Schwartz-Watts's testimony was not relevant.Â  He has also failed to present\r\n  evidence that he suffered prejudice from the exclusion of his mental health\r\n  history.Â  Ultimately, Tennant failed to prove there is a reasonable probability\r\n  that the jury's verdict was influenced by the lack of Schwartz-Watts's\r\n  testimony.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in excluding\r\n  Schwartz-Watts's testimony.\r\nII. Suicide Note\r\nTennant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit the suicide note because it\r\n  was probative of his state of mind and relevant to his defense of consent.Â \r\n  Additionally, he asserts the suicide note was admissible pursuant to Rule 106,\r\n  SCRE, the rule of completeness.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;'Hearsay'\r\n  is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\r\n  trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.&quot;Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  &quot;A 'statement' is (1) an oral or\r\n  written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by\r\n  the person as an assertion.&quot;Â  Rule 801(a), SCRE.Â  &quot;Hearsay is not\r\n  admissible except as provided by [the South Carolina Rules of Evidence] or by\r\n  other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of this State or by statute.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 802, SCRE.Â  An exception to the rule against hearsay is a &quot;statement\r\n  of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical\r\n  condition . . . but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the\r\n  fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation,\r\n  identification, or terms of declarant's will.&quot;Â  Rule 803(3), SCRE.\r\nRule\r\n  106 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence states:Â  &quot;When a writing, or\r\n  recorded statement, or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party\r\n  may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other\r\n  writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered\r\n  contemporaneously with it.&quot;Â  Our supreme court held in State v.\r\n    Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 380, 605 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2004), that when the\r\n  State elicits portions of a communication made by a defendant, &quot;the rule\r\n  of completeness requires the defendant be permitted to inquire into the full\r\n  substance of that conversation.&quot;Â  \r\nHere, Tennant's argument that the suicide note is not\r\n  hearsay because it depicts his state of mind is misplaced.Â  Rule 803(3)\r\n  specifically excludes a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact\r\n  remembered.Â  Rule 803(3), SCRE.Â  Additionally, the suicide note does not\r\n  pertain to Tennant's state of mind other than to assert his memory of the\r\n  events of the assault.Â  Accordingly, the note is offered to prove the truth of\r\n  the matter asserted â€“ that Victim consented to the sexual encounter â€“ and is\r\n  therefore inadmissible hearsay.\r\nMoreover, Tennant's\r\n  assertion that the rule of completeness requires the admission of the suicide\r\n  note is erroneous.Â  He sought to introduce the suicide note to put into context\r\n  the response letter he wrote to Victim almost nine months later.Â  The trial court\r\n  did not err by rejecting this argument because the contents of the suicide note\r\n  and the response letter are starkly different, and the writings were not\r\n  contemporaneous or responsive to one another.Â  Essentially, the two writings\r\n  are wholly distinct.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court property excluded\r\n  the suicide note as inadmissible hearsay.\r\nIII. Rape Shield Statute\r\nTennant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to question Victim and\r\n  introduce evidence about their unusual sexual history, including &quot;rough sex&quot;\r\n  and the infliction of pain, because the exclusion of this sexual history\r\n  evidence denied him his right to present a complete defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admission of a victim's sexual conduct is limited by statute:Â  \r\n\r\n  (1)\r\n    Evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual conduct, opinion evidence\r\n    of the victim's sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the victim's sexual\r\n    conduct is not admissible in prosecutions under Sections 16-3-615 and 16-3-652\r\n    to 16-3-656; however, evidence of the victim's sexual conduct with the\r\n    defendant or evidence of specific instances of sexual activity with persons\r\n    other than the defendant introduced to show source or origin of semen,\r\n    pregnancy, or disease about which evidence has been introduced previously at\r\n    trial is admissible if the judge finds that such evidence is relevant to a\r\n    material fact and issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial\r\n    nature does not outweigh its probative value. Evidence of specific instances of\r\n    sexual activity which would constitute adultery and would be admissible under\r\n    rules of evidence to impeach the credibility of the witness may not be\r\n    excluded.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-659.1(1) (2003).\r\nAs a threshold\r\n  matter, it is questionable whether this issue is preserved for our review\r\n  because, although Tennant requested that the trial court address the\r\n  admissibility of Victim's sexual history during or following her testimony,\r\n  Tennant neglected to pursue the issue again.\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  addressing the merits, Tennant maintains the evidence of their sexual history was\r\n  necessary for the jury's understanding of his defense of consent, and to\r\n  corroborate Schwartz-Watts's testimony that he could not sexually satisfy Victim.Â \r\n  However, the proffer contained allegations of specific instances of Victim's\r\n  sexual conduct, including opinion evidence and reputation evidence.Â  The\r\n  evidence proffered was not intended to be introduced to show source of origin\r\n  of semen, pregnancy, or disease.Â  Moreover, the evidence of Victim's sexual\r\n  history was not relevant to any issue at trial.Â  While Tennant contends Victim\r\n  preferred &quot;rough sex,&quot; there is no evidence they ever engaged in\r\n  &quot;rough sex.&quot;Â  Additionally, the record is void of any evidence the\r\n  sex between Tennant and Victim on the night of the assault was\r\n  &quot;rough.&quot;Â  Lastly, in Tennant's proffer, he contradicts his assertion\r\n  he and Victim engaged in &quot;rough sex&quot; by stating he never did anything\r\n  to hurt her during sex, despite her desires.Â  Thus, the trial court properly\r\n  excluded the proffered evidence of Victim's sexual history pursuant to the Rape\r\n  Shield Statute.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Tennant's convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Victim had a total of four children; Tennant did not\r\nfather the eldest.\r\n[2] Victim's children stayed at Tennant's grandmother's\r\nhouse, where Tennant lived, while she worked.Â  \r\n[3] At trial, Victim testified she would have told\r\nTennant anything because she was scared of him hurting her.\r\n[4] Tennant characterized this note as a suicide note.Â \r\n  However, the State maintained this note was not a suicide note, but contended\r\nthat a different note, not introduced at trial, was the actual suicide note.\r\n[5] While Tennant maintains on appeal the proffer\r\n  contains evidence of his sexual history with Victim, including &quot;rough\r\n  sex,&quot; the closest statement in the proffer actually characterizing Victim's\r\n  sexual preferences to include &quot;rough sex&quot; is located in proffer\r\n  thirteen.Â  Proffer thirteen references one of Tennant's writings describing\r\n  their sexual relationship:Â  &quot;I tried everything to satisfy her normal but\r\n  she wanted me to hurt her and it was not normal and I never done it and she\r\nstopped wanting sex.&quot; \r\n[6] Moreover, at the close of Tennant's proffer of\r\n  Schwartz-Watts, the trial court reiterated the exclusion of testimony regarding\r\n  Victim's prior sexual history pursuant to the Rape Shield Statute.Â  \r\n[7] Additionally, at the close of Schwartz-Watts's\r\n  proffered testimony, the trial court again addressed the admissibility of the\r\n  suicide note.Â  The trial court determined the &quot;note[] would be introduced\r\n  literally to prove the truth of the matter to the jury that there was consent,\r\nthat she agreed to it&quot; and thus, found the suicide note inadmissible.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4546","title":"State v.

Celia Robinson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney\r\n          General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\n          Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General\r\n          William M. Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert Mills Ariail, of\r\n          Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS,\r\n  J:Â \r\n  James F. Russell appeals his conviction for first-degree criminal sexual\r\n  conduct (CSC) with a minor.Â  He argues the circuit court erred in admitting the\r\n  victimâ€™s (Child) prior consistent statement pursuant to section 17-23-175 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), because it improperly bolstered Child's\r\n  testimony and because its probative value was substantially outweighed by its\r\nprejudicial impact.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the evening of July 10, 2005, Russell\r\n  attended a party at the home of Child's mother (Mother).Â  Unable to sleep\r\n  because of noise from the party, Child, who was six years old, got up from his\r\n  bed and followed Russell outside.Â  Russell led Child to a covered picnic table\r\n  on one side of the back yard.Â  According to Child, Russell told Child not to\r\n  tell Mother, and then he pulled Child's pants down and placed his mouth on\r\n  Child's genitals.Â  Child stated when Russell pulled Child's hand toward\r\n  Russell's genitals, Child slipped out of Russell's grasp, pulled up his pants,\r\nand ran to Mother.Â  Child told Mother about the incident.Â  \r\nLater, an altercation arose between\r\n  Russell and a friend of Mother's boyfriend, and police were called.[1]Â  Seeing the\r\n  police cars, Child's grandmother (Grandmother) walked to Mother's house to\r\n  investigate and translated sign language for the officers.Â  According to\r\n  Grandmother, Russell was present and repeatedly told her he had not done\r\n  anything to Child.Â  At the time, she did not know what he meant.Â  On July 13,\r\n2005, Mother reported the sexual assault to police.Â  \r\nOn August 4, 2005, Russell was arrested\r\n  for CSC.Â  At trial, the State presented Child and the investigators who\r\n  interviewed him.Â  At the end of its case, the State played a videotape of\r\n  Child's interview with a counselor.Â  Russell objected to introduction of the videotape\r\n  at the end of the State's case as violative of his Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  confrontation and as unfairly prejudicial and cumulative to other testimony.Â \r\n  The circuit court admitted the tape, and Russell was convicted and sentenced to\r\nthirty years' imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion\r\n  accompanied by probable prejudice.Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596\r\nS.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Improper\r\nBolstering\r\nRussell\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in admitting Child's videotaped interview\r\n  because the statements contained in the tape constituted a prior consistent\r\nstatement that improperly bolstered Child's testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  17-23-175(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) permits the admission of\r\n  out-of-court statements by child sexual abuse victims when the following\r\nconditions are met: \r\n\r\n  (1) the\r\n    statement was given in response to questioning conducted during an\r\n    investigative interview of the child;\r\n  (2)Â Â Â Â  an audio\r\n    and visual recording of the statement is preserved on film, videotape, or other\r\n    electronic means . . . ;\r\n  (3)Â Â Â Â  the\r\n    child testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-examination on the\r\n    elements of the offense and the making of the out-of-court statement; and \r\n  (4)Â Â Â Â  the\r\n    court finds, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that the\r\n    totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides\r\n    particularized guarantees of the trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nRussell\r\n  is correct that the admission of the videotape would likely be error in absence\r\n  of the statute.Â  Generally, a prior consistent statement is not admissible\r\n  unless the witness is charged with recent fabrication or improper motive or\r\n  influence.Â  Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE; State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 123-24,\r\n  551 S.E.2d 240, 245 (2001).Â  In CSC cases, such hearsay statements are\r\n  admissible, but only to the extent they are limited to the time and place of\r\n  the assault.Â  State v. Barrett, 299 S.C. 485, 486-87, 386 S.E.2d 242,\r\n  243 (1989); State v. Jolly, 304 S.C. 34, 37, 402 S.E.2d 895, 897 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1991).\r\nHowever,\r\n  in this case, the legislature has made a specific allowance for these\r\n  out-of-court statements by child victims provided certain elements are met.Â  In\r\n  this case, Russell does not argue the requirements were not met.Â  In essence,\r\n  Russell argues the statute itself, under any circumstances, permits improper\r\n  corroboration or bolstering in conflict with the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence.[2]Â \r\n  However, the South Carolina Rules of Evidence expressly acknowledge the superiority\r\n  of statutes in such cases:Â  &quot;Except as otherwise provided by rule or by\r\n    statute, [the South Carolina Rules of Evidence] govern proceedings in the\r\n  courts of South Carolina . . . .&quot; Â Rule 101, SCRE (emphasis added).Â \r\nTherefore, Russell's argument, although well-made, must fail.\r\nII. Prejudicial\r\n  Versus Probative Analysis\r\nRussell\r\n  contends Child's videotaped interview was improperly admitted because its\r\n  probative value was significantly outweighed by its prejudicial effect.Â  We\r\ndisagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State suggests Russell's argument is not properly preserved.Â  At trial, Russell\r\n  argued the videotape lacked probative value because it was cumulative of\r\n  Child's trial testimony.Â  On appeal, Russell also argues the videotape is\r\n  prejudicial because Child is seen drawing a card for his mother and\r\n  &quot;playfully interacting with the counselor,&quot; thereby stirring the\r\n  emotions of the jurors.Â  We find Russell's argument regarding Child's\r\n  interaction with the counselor is not preserved for our review.Â  See State\r\n    v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005) (holding an\r\n  issue is not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another\r\n  ground raised on appeal).Â  Furthermore, while the videotape of Child's\r\n  interview may have been cumulative to his testimony at trial, it was highly\r\n  probative to the question of Russell's guilt or innocence.Â  Therefore, we find\r\n  any prejudice to Russell was outweighed by the probative value of the\r\nvideotape.\r\nBased\r\non the foregoing, the ruling of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\nand WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Child's and\r\n  Grandmother's testimony suggested this altercation occurred later the same\r\n  evening.Â  However, police dispatch records indicated it likely occurred two\r\nnights later, on July 12, 2005.Â  \r\n[2] At oral\r\n  argument, Russell attempted to ground his improper bolstering argument in the\r\n  constitutional protections afforded by the Sixth Amendment of the United States\r\n  Constitution.Â  However, no constitutional argument was raised in Russell's\r\n  appellate brief.Â  The issue is therefore not preserved for our review.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B),\r\n  SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in\r\n  the statement of issues on appeal.&quot;);Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 250, 551 S.E.2d 274, 278 (Ct.

Leevy, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tSamuel W. Outten, William J. Watkins, and Michael J. Bogle, of\r\n  Greenville and Susan Taylor Wall and Kristina Y. Cook, of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.: This legal malpractice matter comes before this Court after\r\n  the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the law firm of Logan, Jolley,\r\n  &amp; Smith, LLP, James Jolley, Jr., and David Sumner (collectively\r\n  Respondents) based on the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Gladys Kelly (Kelly) argues that she timely discovered her cause of action for\r\n  legal malpractice less than three years prior to the filing of her complaint\r\n  against Respondents.Â  Alternatively, Kelly contends that Respondents should be\r\n  equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a bar to her legal\r\n  malpractice claims.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 1, 1997,\r\n  Kelly gave birth to a son, Watavious Barker (Watavious).Â  At birth, Watavious\r\n  suffered severe and permanent injuries, including irreversible brain damage,\r\n  due to certain improper delivery procedures employed by his health care\r\n  providers.Â  Watavious spent the first two years of his life in the hospital and\r\n  was then placed with a foster family who currently cares for him.Â  Neither Kelly\r\n  nor Watavious' natural father, Wiley Barker (Barker), have made significant\r\n  efforts since his birth to financially support, care for, or obtain custody of\r\n  Watavious.Â  Â \r\nIn 1999, Kelly contacted Luther McDaniel (McDaniel), a\r\n  Georgia attorney, to pursue an action on Watavious' behalf.Â  McDaniel\r\n  associated James Jolley, Jr., and David Sumner as South Carolina counsel.Â  On\r\n  April 12, 1999, Respondents filed a medical malpractice suit against the\r\n  hospital, the delivering doctors, and the doctors' practice.Â  Respondents\r\n  sought damages for Barker in his individual capacity as well as in his capacity\r\n  as natural father and guardian ad litem for Watavious.Â  Kelly was not named as\r\n  an individual party-plaintiff. Â On April 19, 1999, a week after Respondents\r\n  filed the medical malpractice action, Kelly signed a letter drafted by\r\n  McDaniel, in which she stated, &quot;I do not wish to participate in the\r\n  lawsuit as a party to the action. . . . I do not believe the chances of success\r\n  in the case for my son will be improved by joining the lawsuit as a separate\r\n  party-plaintiff.&quot;Â  \r\nOn August 8, 2000, Respondents filed a motion to\r\n  substitute Kelly for Barker as Watavious' guardian ad litem.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted this motion on January 3, 2001.Â  On that date, the circuit court also\r\n  denied Respondents' request to amend the complaint to include Kelly as an\r\n  individual party-plaintiff in the medical malpractice action.Â  In so doing, the\r\n  court specifically stated, &quot;Gladys Kelly [is] not an individual\r\n  party-plaintiff.&quot; (emphasis in original). Â By this time, the statute of\r\n  limitations on any of Kelly's potential medical malpractice claims had\r\n  expired.Â  On March 1, 2001, the claims against the hospital were settled for\r\n  $450,000.Â  Both Kelly and Barker received $7,500 of this settlement. Â The\r\n  caption on the settlement indicated that Kelly was representing Watavious'\r\n  interests as his natural mother and guardian ad litem but not as an individual\r\n  party-plaintiff.Â  \r\nSubsequently, on October 1, 2002, Jolley and Sumner\r\n  moved to be relieved as counsel in the remaining medical malpractice case\r\n  against the doctors and their practice based upon a conflict of interest, which\r\n  was not divulged in open court due to its confidential nature stemming from the\r\n  attorney-client relationship.Â  Kelly and Barker were present at this hearing.Â \r\n  The court specifically questioned Kelly on whether anyone had coerced, forced,\r\n  or threatened her into consenting to relieve Respondents, and Kelly replied,\r\n  &quot;No, sir.&quot;Â  In addition, Kelly testified under oath that she\r\n  understood the basis for Respondents' motion and that she agreed with their\r\n  decision to be relieved.Â  In its November 12, 2002 order granting Respondents'\r\n  motion, the circuit court stated that Respondents &quot;ha[d] done everything\r\n  necessary to adequately protect the legal interests of [Barker, Kelly, and\r\n  Watavious] in this matter.&quot;Â  Â \r\nAfter the\r\n  settlement against the hospital, Watavious' foster parents petitioned the\r\n  family court on May 20, 2002, to terminate Kelly and Barker's parental rights\r\n  and to adopt Watavious.Â  The family court continued the matter based on its\r\n  inability to determine how the child came into the foster parents' care as well\r\n  as whether the Department of Social Services ever had custody of Watavious.Â  Then,\r\n  on December 12, 2002, Watavious' foster parents moved to terminate Kelly as Watavious'\r\n  guardian ad litem and to substitute themselves as party-plaintiffs in Watavious'\r\n  medical malpractice suit.Â  Kelly was in attendance at the January 9, 2003\r\n  hearing on this motion.Â  The court reiterated at the outset that Respondents\r\n  had been relieved of all obligations to represent Kelly in the remaining\r\n  medical malpractice suit pursuant to its November 2002 order.Â  In granting the\r\n  foster parents' motion, the court also terminated Luther McDaniel's\r\n  authorization to practice law pro hac vice in South Carolina for purposes of\r\n  the medical malpractice case due to his repeated failure to respond to court\r\n  requests as well as his failure to appear at the hearing.Â  At the hearing and\r\n  later in the court's order, the court made repeated serious admonitions to\r\n  Kelly to obtain counsel immediately, and it granted Kelly a thirty-day stay of\r\n  all legal proceedings to find substitute counsel.Â  A copy of the court's January\r\n  29, 2003 order was mailed to Kelly by certified mail on February 8, 2003.Â  \r\nOn September 17, 2003, the circuit court dismissed\r\n  Kelly as mother and natural guardian from the medical malpractice action\r\n  against the remaining defendant doctor and his practice.Â  Shortly thereafter,\r\n  the medical malpractice claims against the delivering doctor and his practice\r\n  were settled for $350,000.Â  Kelly did not receive any proceeds from this\r\n  settlement.Â  \r\nAlmost\r\n  three years later, Kelly filed the instant legal malpractice suit against\r\n  Respondents on September 11, 2006.Â  Kelly alleged in her complaint that she\r\n  retained Respondents to represent her individual interests in the medical\r\n  malpractice suits and that they failed to sue on her behalf for alleged personal\r\n  injuries suffered during Watavious' birth.Â  Respondents then filed a\r\n  motion for summary judgment, claiming the three-year statute of limitations had\r\n  expired on Kelly's claim for legal malpractice.Â  On March 27, 2007, the circuit\r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents.Â  The circuit court held\r\n  that Kelly was on inquiry notice, if not actual notice, that a cause of action\r\n  might exist against Respondents on at least five instances between April 12,\r\n  1999, and January 29, 2003; thus, Kelly failed to timely file her complaint\r\n  within the three-year statute of limitations.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nUpon\r\n  review of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard applied by the circuit court pursuant to Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 451, 548 S.E.2d 868, 873 (2001).Â \r\n  The circuit court should grant summary judgment &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C.\r\n  208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334&nbsp;(2003).Â  In determining whether any triable\r\n  issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed\r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Running of the Statute of\r\n  Limitations\r\nKelly\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting Respondents' motion for summary\r\n  judgment based on the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nStatutes\r\n  of limitations are not simply technicalities.Â  Moates v. Bobb, 322 S.C.\r\n  172, 176, 470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  On the contrary, they have long\r\n  been respected as fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system.Â  Hooper v.\r\n    Ebenezer Senior Serv. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., 377 S.C. 217, 227, 659 S.E.2d 213,\r\n  218 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Statutes of limitations embody important public policy concerns\r\n  as they stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote repose by giving\r\n  security and stability to human affairs. Â Moates, 322 S.C. at 172, 470\r\n  S.E.2d at 404.Â  One purpose of a statute of limitations is &quot;to relieve the\r\n  courts of the burden of trying stale claims when a plaintiff has slept on his\r\n  [or her] rights.&quot; Â McKinney v. CSX Transp., Inc., 298 S.C. 47,\r\n  49-50, 378 S.E.2d 69, 70 (Ct. App. 1989) (internal quotations and citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Another purpose of a statute of limitations is to protect potential\r\n  defendants from protracted fear of litigation. Â Pelzer\r\n    v. State, 378\r\n  S.C. 516, 520, 662 S.E.2d 618, 620 (Ct. App. 2008) (internal citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our\r\n  judicial system.&quot;Â  Hooper, 377 S.C. at 228,\r\n  659 S.E.2d at 219 (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe statute of limitations for a legal\r\n  malpractice action is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (2005)\r\n  (stating the statute of limitations\r\n  for &quot;an action for assault, battery, or any injury to the person or rights\r\n  of another, not arising on contract and not enumerated by law&quot; is three\r\n  years); see also Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 444-45, 492\r\n  S.E.2d 794, 799 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding Â§ 15-3-530(5)\r\n  provides a three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions).Â \r\n  Pursuant to the discovery rule, the limitations period commences when the facts\r\n  and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and\r\n  experience on notice that some claim against another party might exist.Â  Burgess\r\n    v. Am. Cancer Soc'y, S.C. Div., Inc., 300 S.C. 182, 186, 386 S.E.2d 798,\r\n  800 (Ct. App. 1989); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005) (&quot;[A]ll\r\n  actions initiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three\r\n  years after the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should\r\n  have known that he had a cause of action.&quot;). \r\nUnder\r\n  section 15-3-535, the statute of limitations\r\n  is triggered not merely by knowledge of an injury but by knowledge of diligently\r\n  acquired facts sufficient to put an injured person on notice of the existence\r\n  of a cause of action against another.Â  Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372,\r\n  376, 610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005).Â  The standard as to when the limitations period\r\n  begins to run is objective rather than subjective.Â  Burgess, 300 S.C. at\r\n  186, 386 S.E.2d at 800.Â  Furthermore, &quot;[t]he statute is not delayed until\r\n  the injured party seeks advice of counsel or develops a full-blown theory of\r\n  recovery; instead, reasonable diligence requires a plaintiff to 'act with some\r\n  promptness.'&quot;Â  Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 377, 500 S.E.2d\r\n  204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant matter, Kelly claims there is no evidence in the record to show\r\n  that she should have been aware of any potential claims against Respondents\r\n  prior to September 17, 2003, when the circuit court dismissed her as a party\r\n  from the remaining medical malpractice action.[1]Â \r\n  However, the record demonstrates otherwise.Â  As recited in the circuit court's\r\n  order, there were at least five instances over a course of almost four years,\r\n  beginning with the filing of the medical malpractice complaint on April 12,\r\n  1999, and ending with the court's January 29, 2003 order to relieve Respondents\r\n  as counsel in the medical malpractice suit, when Kelly was on constructive\r\n  notice, if not actual notice, that a cause of action might exist against\r\n  Respondents.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that Kelly was not named as an individual party-plaintiff in the medical\r\n  malpractice complaint filed against the hospital on April 12, 1999.Â  Kelly had\r\n  the ability and opportunity to examine the complaint, and her failure to do so did\r\n  not prevent the statute from beginning to run.Â  Berry, 328 S.C. at 445,\r\n  492 S.E.2d at 799-800 (&quot;An\r\n  individual on inquiry or constructive notice is held to be on notice of the\r\n  contents of documents filed in conformity with applicable statutory law, which\r\n  an inquiry would have revealed.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run at\r\n  the time the individual has constructive or inquiry notice.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  on April 19, 1999, one week after the filing of the complaint, Kelly agreed to\r\n  sign a letter that stated, &quot;I do not wish to participate in the lawsuit as\r\n  a party to the action. . . . I do not believe the chances of success in the\r\n  case for my son will be improved by joining the lawsuit as a separate\r\n  party-plaintiff.&quot;Â  At no time has\r\n  Kelly presented any evidence to indicate she was incompetent at that time, nor\r\n  has she shown that Respondents coerced, forced, or threatened her into signing\r\n  the letter. Â See Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253,\r\n  263, 626 S.E.2d 6, 12 (2005) (stating that a competent person generally is\r\n  presumed to have knowledge and understanding of a document he or she signs,\r\n  absent evidence the signature was obtained by misrepresentation, fraud,\r\n  forgery, or duress).Â  \r\nKelly\r\n  argues that because she had no legal training or advice from another lawyer,\r\n  she could not know the legal import of the complaint's caption or the\r\n  significance of the letter she signed, but this is not the appropriate standard\r\n  by which her conduct must be measured. See Maher, 331 S.C. at\r\n  377, 500 S.E.2d at 207 (&quot;The statute is not delayed until the injured\r\n  party seeks advice of counsel or develops a full-blown theory of recovery . . .\r\n  .&quot;).Â  We recognize that a client should be able to rely on an attorney's\r\n  advice and be able to follow this advice without fear the attorney is not\r\n  acting in the client's best interest.Â  True v. Monteith, 327 S.C. 116,\r\n  120, 489 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1997).Â  However, regardless of the purpose or legal\r\n  strategy behind signing the April 1999 letter, the letter's terms are not so complex\r\n  that it would prevent a person of common knowledge and experience from\r\n  understanding its meaning.Â  From an objective viewpoint, the complaint and\r\n  letter were sufficient to put Kelly on notice that she was not being represented\r\n  in the medical malpractice suits for any personal injuries that may have\r\n  resulted to her from the birth of her son, Watavious.Â  Simply put, we believe a\r\n  person of common knowledge would be on constructive notice that some right had\r\n  been invaded at the time of signing a letter to relinquish all personal rights\r\n  to recovery, particularly if the individual is claiming to have suffered\r\n  cognizable personal injuries.Â  See Epstein, 363 S.C. at 376, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 818 (stating that the exercise of reasonable diligence means an\r\n  injured party must act with some promptness when the facts and circumstances of\r\n  an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that\r\n  some right has been invaded or some claim against another party might exist).Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  even if these two events were insufficient to trigger the statute of\r\n  limitations, Kelly had a third opportunity to discover a potential cause of\r\n  action against Respondents.Â  In its order dated January 3, 2001, the circuit\r\n  court placed Kelly on actual notice that she was not an individual\r\n  party-plaintiff to the underlying medical malpractice action.Â  During the\r\n  hearing to substitute Kelly as Watavious' guardian ad litem, Respondents\r\n  requested that the circuit court amend the medical malpractice complaint to add\r\n  Kelly as a plaintiff in her individual capacity.Â  The court denied the\r\n  request and explicitly stated that Kelly was not an individual party-plaintiff\r\n  in its order.Â  Despite Kelly's claim that as a layperson, she requires the\r\n  assistance of a lawyer to understand the legal significance of &quot;individual\r\n  party-plaintiff,&quot; the test is not whether she understood the full import\r\n  of the term, but whether she was presented with any existing facts or\r\n  circumstances to indicate that Respondents were not asserting any claims in the\r\n  medical malpractice suit for Kelly in her individual capacity.Â  See Knox\r\n    v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 566, 570-71, 608 S.E.2d 459, 462 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005) (&quot;[T]he fact that the injured party does not comprehend the\r\n  full extent of his injuries is immaterial.&quot;].Â  The January 3, 2001 order\r\n  clearly presented Kelly with these facts. \r\nMoreover,\r\n  Kelly was also present at the hearing to relieve Respondents as counsel on\r\n  October 21, 2002, and the circuit court directly instructed Kelly to find\r\n  substitute counsel within thirty days because Respondents no longer had any\r\n  continuing duties or obligations to Kelly. Â At that hearing, the court\r\n  engaged in an extensive dialogue with Kelly regarding her understanding of the\r\n  proceeding, her desire to relieve Respondents as counsel, and whether anyone or\r\n  anything improperly influenced her decision.Â  Kelly's responses indicated that\r\n  she fully understood Respondents would no longer be representing her in the\r\n  medical malpractice action or pursuing any claims, individual or otherwise, on\r\n  her behalf.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  Jolley's November 18, 2002 letter to Kelly, which included the case caption,\r\n  reemphasized that Respondents were no longer responsible for Kelly's\r\n  representation on any of her medical malpractice claims as Jolley stated,\r\n  &quot;I cannot emphasize strongly enough the need for you to get in touch with\r\n  Luther [McDaniel] or your new South Carolina counsel immediately.Â  I will\r\n  maintain a copy of your file in my office and you or your new lawyer may have\r\n  copies of anything at any time.&quot;Â  Despite receiving this letter and the\r\n  court's admonition to find substitute counsel, Kelly did not hire a new\r\n  attorney until almost one year later. Â While Kelly claims that she was ignorant\r\n  of the facts to prove she had a claim against Respondents at that time, her\r\n  failure to have developed a full-blown theory of recovery or to seek other\r\n  counsel is not enough to prevent the statute of limitations from running,\r\n  particularly when those facts and circumstances could have been known to Kelly\r\n  through the exercise of ordinary care and reasonable diligence.Â  See Epstein,\r\n  363 S.C. at 376, 610 S.E.2d at 818 (stating that it is not when a party seeks\r\n  the advice of counsel or develops a full-blown theory of recovery that the\r\n  statute of limitations begins to run); Burgess, 300 S.C. at 185, 386\r\n  S.E.2d at 799 (&quot;A party cannot escape the application of this rule by\r\n  claiming ignorance of existing facts and circumstances, because the law also\r\n  provides that if such facts and circumstances could have been known to\r\n  the party through the exercise of ordinary care and reasonable diligence, the\r\n  same result follows.&quot;) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nViewing\r\n  the facts in the light most favorable to Kelly, she should have known by January\r\n  29, 2003, that she was not being represented in her individual capacity in the\r\n  medical malpractice suit.Â  On that date, the circuit court terminated her\r\n  status as Watavious' guardian ad litem and confirmed that Kelly would only be\r\n  able to proceed as the natural parent of Watavious, not as an individual\r\n  party-plaintiff. Â Again, Kelly received actual notice of her status in the\r\n  medical malpractice suit at this time as she was present at that hearing and\r\n  received a copy of the order by certified mail.Â  \r\nKelly's\r\n  failure to file suit until September 11, 2006, prevents her from maintaining a\r\n  legal malpractice suit against Respondents. Â Were we to find the statute of\r\n  limitations began to run on the latest date, January 29, 2003, she still waited\r\n  over three years to file suit.Â  The parties do not dispute the material dates\r\n  involved in this appeal â€“ only which date controls for purposes of the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Â Even assessing the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to Kelly, only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the facts.Â \r\n  Because Kelly should have known that she was not an individual party-plaintiff\r\n  by no later than January 29, 2003, her legal malpractice claims against\r\n  Respondents are barred by the statute of limitations as a matter of law.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Equitable Estoppel\r\nKelly\r\n  alternatively contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\n  judgment because the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents Respondents from\r\n  asserting the statute of limitations as a defense.Â  Kelly also argues in her\r\n  brief that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled and that she\r\n  should benefit from the fraudulent concealment defense to the statute of\r\n  limitations.[2]Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  doctrine of equitable estoppel applies when the statute of limitations has run\r\n  and the defendant asserts the running of the statute of limitations as a\r\n  defense.Â  Hooper, 377 S.C. at 239, 659 S.E.2d at 225 (citing Dasha v.\r\n    Maine Med. Ctr., 665 A.2d 993 (Me. 1995)).Â  However, the defendant is\r\n  estopped from benefitting from the statute of limitations as a defense because\r\n  the defendant has acted in such a manner as to induce the plaintiff to delay in\r\n  timely filing a cause of action.Â  Id. at 239-40, 659 S.E.2d at 225.Â  This\r\n  conduct may be either an express representation that the claim will be settled\r\n  without litigation or actions suggesting that a lawsuit is unnecessary.Â  Moates,\r\n  322 S.C. at 175, 470 S.E. 2d at 403.\r\nThe\r\n  party asserting equitable estoppel bears the burden of establishing all the\r\n  elements.Â  Estes v. Roper Temp. Servs. Inc., 304 S.C. 120, 122, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  To establish equitable estoppel, the party\r\n  claiming estoppel must prove that he or she (1) lacked knowledge and means of\r\n  obtaining knowledge of the truth of the facts in question; and (2) relied upon\r\n  the conduct of the party to be estopped.Â  Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 340\r\n  S.C. 98, 107 n.2, 531 S.E.2d 287, 292 n.2 (2000).Â  The party claiming estoppel\r\n  must also establish that the party to be estopped (1) acted in a way amounting\r\n  to a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) intended such\r\n  conduct to be acted upon by the other party; and (3) possessed knowledge, either\r\n  actual or constructive, of the true facts.Â  Id.\r\nKelly\r\n  fails to establish the first element of equitable estoppel as it pertains to her.Â \r\n  She has not adequately demonstrated that she did not know she was not an\r\n  individual party-plaintiff to the medical malpractice actions and that she had\r\n  no means of obtaining this knowledge. Â Kelly had several occasions to examine\r\n  or investigate her status in the medical malpractice suits.Â  First, Kelly\r\n  specifically waived her right to pursue a cause of action against the hospital for\r\n  any personal injuries as a result of Watavious' birth when she signed a letter\r\n  to this effect on April 19, 1999.Â  Second, Kelly attended the hearing where she\r\n  was substituted as Watavious' guardian ad litem and was present when the\r\n  circuit court denied Respondents' request to add her as an individual\r\n  party-plaintiff to the medical malpractice suit.Â  The court's order reflected\r\n  this as well in stating: &quot;Gladys Kelly [is] not an individual party\r\n  plaintiff.&quot;Â  Additionally, the caption in the complaint and two subsequent\r\n  court orders clearly did not mention Kelly as an individual party-plaintiff.Â  See Berry, 328 S.C. at 445, 492 S.E.2d at 799 (&quot;An individual on\r\n  inquiry or constructive notice is held to be on notice of the contents of\r\n  documents filed in conformity with applicable statutory law, which an inquiry\r\n  would have revealed.&quot;).Â  Kelly's claim that she could not obtain the\r\n  knowledge to place her on notice because she did not have other legal counsel\r\n  to help her understand legal documents or proceedings is unconvincing as the\r\n  statute of limitations is not tolled solely because a party is without counsel\r\n  or has not fully developed a theory of recovery.Â  See Maher, 331\r\n  S.C. at 377, 500 S.E.2d at 207. \r\nKelly\r\n  also failed to prove the second element of equitable estoppel. Â The circuit court\r\n  notified her on more than one occasion that she was not in a position to\r\n  recover in her individual capacity in the medical malpractice suits; thus, she\r\n  could not have reasonably relied on any alleged representations by Respondents\r\n  to the contrary.Â  First, on January 3, 2001, the circuit court issued its order\r\n  specifically providing that Kelly was not an individual party-plaintiff.Â \r\n  Second, when the circuit court relieved Respondents as counsel on November 12,\r\n  2002, it stated that Respondents had no continuing duties or obligations to\r\n  Kelly, which logically includes pursuing any individual claims on her behalf.Â \r\n  Last, the circuit court advised Kelly that she was not an individual\r\n  party-plaintiff in its January 29, 2003 order substituting Watavious' foster\r\n  parents as individual-party plaintiffs.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  for equitable estoppel to apply, a plaintiff must be aware that a claim\r\n  might exist prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, but due to\r\n  &quot;some conduct or representation by the defendant,&quot; the plaintiff is\r\n  &quot;induced . . . to delay in filing suit.&quot;Â  Hedgepath v. Am. Tel.\r\n    &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 360, 559 S.E.2d 327, 338 (Ct. App. 2001).Â \r\n  The inducement to delay in filing suit may come in the form of an express\r\n  representation by the defendant that a claim will be settled without litigation\r\n  or by other conduct suggesting a lawsuit is unnecessary.Â  Id.Â  Kelly\r\n  emphatically denies that she was aware of a claim against Respondents for legal\r\n  malpractice at the time she claims Respondents misrepresented her status in the\r\n  medical malpractice suits.Â  If she was not aware of a claim against Respondents\r\n  at that time, she cannot also argue that she reasonably relied on their\r\n  misrepresentations in delaying to file her legal malpractice suit.Â  Because\r\n  Kelly failed to establish that she meets the requirements for equitable\r\n  estoppel, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment based on the\r\n  expiration of the statute of limitations.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nSHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Kelly references September 15, 2003, as the trigger\r\n  date in her brief, but because her dismissal was not final until the circuit court\r\n  filed the order dismissing her as a party from the medical malpractice suit,\r\n  September 17, 2003, is the proper date for her dismissal. Â See Ford v. State Ethics Comm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001)\r\n  (&quot;The written order is the trial judge's\r\n  final order and as such constitutes the final judgment of the court. The final\r\n  written order contains the binding instructions which are to be followed by the\r\n  parties.&quot;) (citing Rule 58, SCRCP). Â \r\n[2] Kelly did not specifically make an equitable tolling\r\n  or fraudulent concealment argument in her Objection to Motion to Dismiss and to\r\n  Summary Judgment or in her Amended Objection to Summary Judgment.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the circuit court did not rule on either of these arguments in its order\r\n  granting summary judgment, and Kelly did not request a reconsideration of the\r\n  order on those grounds.Â  Her failure to do so precludes review of these issues\r\n  on appeal.Â  See Hilton Head Resort v. Resort Inv. Corp., 311 S.C.\r\n  394, 398, 429 S.E.2d 459, 462 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding this court was precluded\r\n  from addressing an issue on appeal when circuit court did not mention the issue\r\n  in its order and appellant made no motion pursuant to Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, to require circuit court to do so).\r\n[3] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4548","title":"Jones v.

Pascoe, both of Greenville, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J.:Â  Robin Jones, by and though her father and guardian ad\r\n    litem (GAL), Douglas Jones, appeals the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n    judgment in favor of Enterprise Rent-A-Car (ERAC).Â  Jones asserts ERAC\r\n    negligently, carelessly, and recklessly entrusted and/or supplied a vehicle to\r\n    an incompetent, habitually reckless, and otherwise unfit driver. Â Alternatively,\r\n    Jones maintains ERAC is the alter ego of its wholly owned subsidiary,\r\n    Enterprise Leasing Company Southeast (Southeast), and should be secondarily and\r\n    financially liable for any tort of Southeast.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSoutheast rented a vehicle to Jeffrey Demary for three months in\r\n  2003.Â  On March 1, 2003, Demary was involved in an accident while driving the\r\n  rented vehicle, when he struck the rear of the vehicle driven by Robin Jones.Â \r\n  The collision caused Jones' vehicle to be pushed to the side of the road and\r\n  overturned.Â  Jones was seriously injured, causing permanent brain damage that\r\n  resulted in medical bills of approximately $1,000,000, and requiring Jones to\r\n  live in a nursing home.Â  \r\nJones,\r\n  by and through her GAL,[1] brought an action[2] in state court against ERAC and Southeast (collectively Respondents) for actual\r\n  and punitive damages, alleging Respondents negligently, carelessly, and\r\n  recklessly entrusted and/or supplied a vehicle to an incompetent, habitually\r\n  reckless, and otherwise unfit driver.Â  Jones also alleged ERAC was the alter ego of Southeast and thus secondarily liable for any claim proven against\r\n  its subsidiary.Â  In support of the complaint, Jones contended Demary had:Â  been\r\n  convicted of at least nine speeding violations while operating a vehicle; been\r\n  convicted of six speeding violations within the prior three years, three of\r\n  which were for speeding greater than twelve miles over the speed limit; three\r\n  speeding convictions while driving an Enterprise vehicle; his license suspended\r\n  for several years for failing to pay tickets; and otherwise demonstrated a\r\n  reckless driving pattern and/or habit.Â  Thereafter, ERAC made a motion to\r\n  dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(2) and (6), SCRCP.Â  Southeast additionally made\r\n  a motion for a protective order against discovery requests made by Jones.Â  \r\nA hearing was held on ERAC's motion to dismiss, and it was\r\n  denied.Â  Subsequently, Southeast's motion for a protective order was partially\r\n  granted by the circuit court.Â  Both Southeast and ERAC made further motions for\r\n  protective orders, in response to a motion by Jones to compel discovery on\r\n  certain matters she had requested.Â  ERAC additionally made a Rule 56, SCRCP\r\n  motion for summary judgment, while Respondents collectively made a motion to\r\n  quash a subpoena filed by Jones against Wachovia Bank.Â  Jones, meanwhile, made\r\n  an additional motion for sanctions resulting from improper deposition conduct.Â \r\n  A hearing was held on the above motions, and the circuit court made the\r\n  following rulings:Â  Respondents' motion to quash was granted, as was the motion\r\n  for a protective order regarding certain financial information; Jones' motion\r\n  for sanctions was denied;[3] and Southeast's motion for a protective order was held in abeyance.Â  Finally,\r\n  the circuit court granted summary judgment to ERAC, which rendered Jones'\r\n  motion to compel and ERAC's motion to protect moot.Â  Jones filed a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP motion for reconsideration of the circuit court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment in favor of ERAC, which was denied.Â  Jones appeals this determination. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. ERAC's Primary\r\n  Liability for Negligent Entrustment\r\nJones\r\n  first maintains the circuit court erred in circumventing her remaining\r\n  discovery requests by prematurely granting ERAC summary judgment.Â  Jones\r\n  contends the motions she filed to compel the discovery requests she had\r\n  previously served on ERAC related directly to the issues of:Â  whether ERAC\r\n  dominates and controls Southeast; whether the knowledge and actual use by ERAC\r\n  and its subsidiaries of the electronic method of checking a person's driving\r\n  history prior to renting a vehicle was known and used in the industry; and whether\r\n  ERAC financed the purchase of the vehicle at issue.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSummary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously\r\n  invoked so that no person will be improperly deprived of\r\n  a trial of the disputed factual issues. Â Baughman\r\n    v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991). Â &quot;This\r\n  means, among other things, that summary judgment\r\n  must not be granted until the opposing party\r\n  has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.&quot; Â Id.Â  Once a Rule 56 motion has been\r\n  made, the evidence and its reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id. at 115, 410 S.E.2d at 545. Â A\r\n  court must then apply the standard set out in Rule 56(c), SCRCP:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after\r\n  adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient\r\n  to establish the existence\r\n  of an element essential to the\r\n  party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\r\n  In such a situation, there can be &quot;no genuine issue as to any material fact,&quot;\r\n  since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily\r\n  renders all other facts immaterial.\r\n  The moving party is &quot;entitled to a judgment as a matter of law&quot;\r\n  because the nonmoving party has failed to make a\r\n  sufficient showing on an essential element\r\n  of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof. \r\n\r\nId. at 116, 420 S.E.2d at 545-46 (citing Celotex Corp.\r\n  v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\r\nTherefore, although\r\n  an appellate court must view the evidence through the prism that is most\r\n  favorable to Jones, her contention regarding the circuit court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment before she had had a full and fair opportunity to complete\r\n  discovery, may only be successful if the evidence she had presented, or the\r\n  evidence she alleges would be introduced through discovery, would create a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact as to ERAC's liability for each element of\r\n  negligent entrustment.Â  \r\nA\r\n  claim for negligent entrustment has been the subject of several cases by both\r\n  this court and the supreme court; however, the elements needed to prove the\r\n  claim have varied. The supreme court has held that the theory of negligent\r\n  entrustment provides the owner or one in control of the vehicle and responsible\r\n  for its use who is negligent in entrusting it to another can be held liable for\r\n  such negligent entrustment.Â  Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Passmore, 275\r\n  S.C. 618, 621, 274 S.E.2d 416, 418 (1981) (citing 19 A.L.R.3d 1175, superseded\r\n  by 91 A.L.R.5th 1).Â  Citing Passmore, this court has extended the\r\n  elements of negligent entrustment to include:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(1) knowledge\r\n  of or knowledge imputable to the owner that the driver was either addicted to\r\n  intoxicants or had the habit of drinking, (2) that the owner knew or had\r\n  imputable knowledge that the driver was likely to drive while intoxicated and\r\n  (3) under these circumstances, the entrustment of a vehicle by the owner to\r\n  such a driver.Â  \r\n\r\nMcAllister v. Graham, 287 S.C. 455, 458, 339 S.E.2d 154, 156 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986) (inserting an element of knowledge of alcohol consumption into the test\r\n  for negligent entrustment).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  test administered in McAllister was further cited by this court in Jackson\r\n    v. Price, 288 S.C. 377, 381-82, 342 S.E.2d 628, 631 (Ct. App. 1986), and\r\n  was affirmed by the supreme court in Gadson ex rel. Gadson v. ECO Servs. of\r\n    S.C., Inc., 374 S.C. 171, 176-77, 648 S.E.2d 585, 588 (2007) (declining to\r\n  adopt sections 308 and 390 Restatement (Second) Torts (1965), instead expressly\r\n  analyzing the facts of the case under the elements of negligent entrustment set\r\n  forth in Jackson).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  case law in our state has tended towards the tort of negligent entrustment that\r\n  comprises an element of drinking, sections 308 and 390 of the Restatement\r\n  (Second) of Torts (1965), involve the application of negligent entrustment to\r\n  situations that do not involve the presence of alcohol.Â  Section 308 provides:\r\n\r\n\tIt is negligence to permit a third person to use a thing or to\r\n  engage in an activity which is under the control of the actor, if the actor\r\n  knows or should know that such person intends or is likely to use the thing or\r\n  to conduct himself in the activity in such a manner as to create an\r\n  unreasonable risk of harm to others.\r\n\r\nSection 390 provides:\r\n\r\n\tOne who\r\n  supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for the use of another\r\n  whom the supplier knows or has reason to know to be likely because of his\r\n  youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable\r\n  risk of physical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should expect to\r\n  share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to liability for physical harm\r\n  resulting to them.\r\n\r\nIn Lydia v.\r\n  Horton, this court adopted sections 308 and 390, as the appropriate\r\n  standard for negligent entrustment.Â  343 S.C. 376, 383-85, 540 S.E.2d 102,\r\n  106-07 (Ct. App. 2000), reversed, 355 S.C. 36, 583 S.E.2d 750 (2003).Â \r\n  In addition, this court sanctioned a first party cause of action for negligent\r\n  entrustment against the entrustor of a vehicle or chattel; however, the supreme\r\n  court granted certiorari and reversed this court, expressly declining to adopt\r\n  sections 308 and 390.Â  Lydia v. Horton, 355 S.C. 36, 43, 583 S.E.2d 750,\r\n  754 (2003).Â  In Gadson ex rel. Gadson v. ECO Services of South Carolina\r\n    Incorporated, this court again considered section 308, stating &quot;[w]e\r\n  do not find the supreme court's ruling in Lydia would prevent\r\n  application of section 308 of the Restatement under the facts of the present\r\n  case as the question addressed in Lydia was whether South Carolina\r\n  recognizes a first party negligent entrustment claim.&quot;Â  Op. No.2005-UP-130,\r\n  n.4 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 18, 2005), reversed, 374 S.C. 171, 648\r\n  S.E.2d 585 (2007).Â  In reversing this court, the supreme court again declined\r\n  to adopt sections 308 and 390.Â  Gadson, 374 S.C. at 176-77, 648 S.E.2d\r\n  at 588.Â  In a concurring opinion, Justice Pleicones wrote in favor of adopting\r\n  sections 308 and 390 as alternative methods of proving negligent entrustment,\r\n  because he found a loophole exists whereby an entrustor could avoid liability\r\n  if there was no evidence the entrustor knew the entrustee was a habitual\r\n  drinker or addicted to alcohol.Â  Id. at 179, 648 S.E.2d at 589-90\r\n  (Pleicones, J., concurring).\r\nHere, unlike in Lydia or Gadson, where a negligent entrustment claim could be decided under\r\n  the elements established in McAllister, there is no suggestion that\r\n  alcohol played any role in this accident.Â  However, neither party has expressly\r\n  requested this court to once again adopt sections 308 and 390, and because the\r\n  only issue before us is ERAC's liability, we find it is unnecessary to adopt\r\n  those sections for the purposes of this appeal, as Jones cannot prove the\r\n  compulsory element of ownership or control under either rubric.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found there was no genuine issue of material fact that ERAC owned\r\n  or controlled the vehicle rented to Demary.Â  The circuit court relied on Jones'\r\n  own complaint, which stated the vehicle was titled to Southeast.Â  &quot;A certificate of title constitutes prima facie\r\n  evidence of vehicle ownership for purposes of insurance coverage, but can be\r\n  rebutted by evidence showing that someone other than the titleholder was the\r\n  real owner.&quot;Â  Unisun Ins. Co. v. First So. Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 419, 423,\r\n  462 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1995).Â  In addition, section 56-1-10(3) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) states an &quot;[o]wner means a person, other than a\r\n  lienholder, having the property or title to a vehicle.Â  The term includes a\r\n  person entitled to the use and possession of a vehicle subject to a security\r\n  interest in another person, but excludes a lessee under a lease not intended as\r\n  security.&quot;Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the rental agreement was between only Southeast and Demary, and the vehicle was\r\n  picked up from a Southeast location.Â  ERAC presented affidavits indicating it exercised\r\n  no control over any of its subsidiaries' use or entrustment of their vehicles,\r\n  which was uncontroverted by Jones.Â  As a result, the circuit court was correct\r\n  in finding Jones failed to prove the essential element of the negligent\r\n  entrustment, ownership and control, and that further discovery on the issue\r\n  would be unnecessary and unavailing.Â  \r\nII. ERAC\r\n  Exists As An Alter Ego of Southeast\r\nJones\r\n  next contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to ERAC\r\n  because it so exercises dominance and control over Southeast that it is the subsidiary's alter ego.[4]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAlter ego describes\r\n  a theory of procedural relief.Â  Drury Dev. Corp. v. Found. Ins. Co., 380\r\n  S.C. 97, 101 n.1, 668 S.E.2d 798, 800 n.1 (2008).Â  &quot;[T]he alter ego\r\n  doctrine is merely a means of piercing the corporate veil.&quot;Â  Id. (citing 18 C.J.S. Corporations Â§ 23 (2008)); see also Mid-South\r\n    Mgt. Co. Inc. v. Sherwood Dev. Corp., 374 S.C. 588, 603-04, 649 S.E.2d 135,\r\n  143-44 (Ct. App. 2007) (affirming the alter ego theory of recovery's\r\n  application to parent and subsidiary situations).Â  Under this theory, when a\r\n  parent company controls the business decisions and actions of its subsidiary,\r\n  the subsidiary becomes an instrument or alter ego of the parent.Â  Peoples\r\n    Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 310 S.C.\r\n  132, 148, 425 S.E.2d 764, 774 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Control required for liability\r\n  under an alter ego doctrine amounts to total domination of the subsidiary to\r\n  the extent the subsidiary manifested no separate corporate interests and\r\n  functioned solely to achieve the purpose of the dominant corporation.Â  Id. (citing Krivo Indus. Supply Co. v. Nat'l Distillers &amp; Chem. Corp.,\r\n  483 F.2d 1098, 1106 (5th Cir. 1973).Â  Moreover, &quot;[c]ommon officers and/or\r\n  directors and public identification of one corporation as the other's\r\n  subsidiary do not, without more, support the conclusion the subsidiary is its\r\n  parent's alter ego or agent for the transaction of its business.&quot;Â  Yarborough\r\n    &amp; Co. v. Schoolfield Furniture Indus., Inc., 275 S.C. 151, 153-54, 268\r\n  S.E.2d 42, 44 (1980) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  merely establishing the level of control or dominance a parent must have over a\r\n  subsidiary, in order to prove it is the alter ego of the subservient\r\n  corporation, is not sufficient to maintain an alter ago action.Â  Mid-South\r\n    Mgt., 374 S.C. at 603, 649 S.E.2d at 143 (citing Colleton County\r\n      Taxpayers v. School Dist. of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 638 S.E.2d 685 (2006); Baker v. Equitable Leasing Corp., 275 S.C. 359, 271 S.E.2d 596 (1980)).Â \r\n  Instead &quot;one must [also] show that the retention of separate corporate\r\n  personalities would promote fraud, wrong or injustice, or would contravene\r\n  public policy.&quot;Â  Mid-South Mgt., 374 S.C. at 603, 649 S.E.2d at\r\n  143.Â  &quot;Furthermore, when\r\n  a motion for summary judgment is made and properly supported, an adverse party\r\n  may not rest solely upon the allegations or denials in his pleading, but must\r\n  set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.&quot;\r\n  Â Colleton County Taxpayers v. School\r\n    Dist. of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 237, 638 S.E.2d 685, 692 (2006) (citing Rule 56(e), SCRCP).\r\nIn\r\n  addition, several factors should be considered before a parent corporation may\r\n  be held liable for the torts of its subsidiaries.Â  These include:Â  stock\r\n  ownership by parent; common officers and directors; financing of subsidiary by\r\n  parent; payment of salaries and other expenses of subsidiary by parent; failure\r\n  of subsidiary to maintain formalities of separate corporate existence; identity\r\n  of logo; and plaintiff's knowledge of subsidiary's separate corporate\r\n  existence.Â  16 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 2d 679 (2006).Â  The circuit court\r\n  stated it considered these factors, although Jones alleges the court failed to\r\n  consider them all.Â  We agree with the circuit court, and find there to be no\r\n  factual basis that ERAC exhibited control over Southeast sufficient to justify\r\n  piercing the corporate veil.Â  There is no evidence of undercapitalization,\r\n  fraud in the Southeast's corporate operations or structure, or that Southeast is\r\n  not financially viable on its own. Â \r\nMoreover,\r\n  evidence indicates ERAC executed no day-to-day control over Southeast.Â  As the\r\n  circuit court found, the boards of directors for ERAC and Southeast hold\r\n  separate meetings, and Southeast pays its own employees from its own banking\r\n  accounts.Â  Finally, and most convincingly, Jones has failed to show how the\r\n  retention of ERAC's and Southeast's corporate formalities would promote wrong\r\n  or injustice, or would contravene public policy.Â  As evidenced by Southeast's\r\n  own responses to Jones' first discovery requests, Southeast is a self-insured\r\n  entity in the amount of $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident for bodily\r\n  injury, but maintains excess insurance with various companies totaling $245\r\n  million.[5]Â \r\n  Given this information, we find Southeast to be adequately prepared and funded\r\n  in the event of a verdict against it; therefore, in the absence of any clear\r\n  dominance or control, no wrong, injustice or contravention of public policy\r\n  would occur in failing to find ERAC the alter ego of Southeast.\r\nCONCLUSION[6]\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court neither erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to ERAC for primary liability on Jones' claim for\r\n  negligent entrustment, nor in finding ERAC is not the alter ego of Southeast.[7]Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Jones' original\r\n  complaint was brought by and through her GAL, who was then listed as her\r\n  mother, also named Robin Jones.Â  However, at some point in the early stages of\r\n  litigation Jones' GAL and accompanying caption was changed to reflect her\r\n  father, Douglas Jones, as GAL.Â  \r\n[2] Jones initially\r\n  brought an action against only Southeast in federal court asserting similar\r\n  allegations.Â  The federal court action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \r\n[3] Jones also\r\n  filed a motion for reconsideration from the court's initial form order which\r\n  denied her request for sanctions, granted Respondents' motion to quash, and\r\n  granted Respondents' motion for a protective order regarding certain financial\r\n  information.Â  Jones' motion was denied.\r\n[4] Jones also\r\n  advanced at oral argument the contention that ERAC could separately be liable\r\n  under a master-servant theory irrespective of an alter ego analysis; however,\r\n  Jones neither plead master-servant liability, nor argued it in her brief, so we\r\n  decline to address the issue.Â  In re: Bruce O., 311 S.C. 514, 515 n.1,\r\n  429 S.E.2d 858, 859 n.1 (Ct. App. 1993) (explaining an appellant may not use\r\n  oral argument as a vehicle to argue issues not argued in his brief).\r\n[5] We note that\r\n  generally, evidence as to whether a person was or was not insured against\r\n  liability is not admissible upon the issue of the person's alleged negligence;\r\n  however, this general rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of\r\n  insurance when offered for another purpose such as proof of ownership or\r\n  control.Â  Rule 411, SCRE.Â  We find Southeast's maintenance of excess insurance\r\n  speaks directly to its independence and viability as a separate corporation.\r\n[6] Jones\r\n  additionally appears to assert the circuit court's grant of summary judgment\r\n  erroneously overruled the prior circuit court ruling, by a different judge,\r\n  which denied ERAC's Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP motion.Â  Jones maintains the prior\r\n  12(b)(6) motion was converted into a motion for summary judgment because\r\n  matters outside of the pleadings were considered; therefore, the subsequent\r\n  grant of summary judgment, which is the subject of this appeal, reversed the\r\n  ruling of another circuit court judge.Â  Although Jones made this argument to\r\n  the circuit court in her Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration, she did not\r\n  make this argument in her initial brief to this court, instead reviving this\r\n  argument in her reply brief.Â  As a result, this issue is not preserved for our\r\n  review, because no new issues may be raised to this court by the appellant in\r\n  the reply brief.Â  See Hunter v. Staples, 335 S.C. 93, 103, 515\r\n  S.E.2d 261, 267 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding appellant was precluded from asserting\r\n  an argument for the first time in its reply brief); Fields v. Melrose Ltd.\r\n    P'ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (acknowledging an appellant may not use the reply brief to argue issues not\r\n  argued in its brief in chief).Â  \r\n[7] ERAC also\r\n  asserts two additional sustaining grounds, including:Â  (1) whether a defendant\r\n  may be liable for negligent entrustment when the plaintiff does not allege\r\n  knowledge by the defendant that the driver was addicted to intoxicants or had\r\n  the habit of drinking; and (2) whether South Carolina imposes a duty on a\r\n  rental car company to investigate the driving history of a customer who\r\n  presents a valid driver's license.Â  In light of our disposition above, we\r\n  decline to address these additional contentions.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues\r\n  when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of\r\n  the appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4549","title":"Fesmire v.

Â We\r\n  reverse the master's order and remand the case for an accounting and partition\r\n  by sale.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  1990, the parties to this action, along with Shelley Digh, jointly purchased a Myrtle Beach condominium from Shelley's employer, B.W. Miller.Â  Shelley, who is\r\n  now deceased, was the wife of George Digh.Â  The two couples were longtime friends\r\n  who took trips together.Â  They executed a promissory note to Miller in the\r\n  amount of $85,000 and a mortgage on the property to secure the note.Â  They also\r\n  entered into a written agreement among themselves setting forth their\r\n  understanding of their respective ownership interests in the property, the\r\n  division of the property's income and expenses, and the disposition of their respective\r\n  interests in the property in the event of a future sale.Â  They intended to use\r\n  the condominium as rental property and also for their occasional personal use. \r\nShelley, who was an accountant, kept the\r\n  financial records on the property.Â  From July 1990 through April 1996, she sent\r\n  mortgage payments to Miller.Â  On a quarterly basis, she determined the amount\r\n  of income collected and total expenses for the property and notified Larry\r\n  Fesmire if any funds were due from him at that time.Â  \r\nIn February 1994, Shelley was diagnosed\r\n  with acute myeloblastic leukemia.Â  From that point forward, the Dighs' personal\r\n  use of the condominium significantly diminished.Â  The leukemia went into\r\n  remission, and Shelley had a bone marrow transplant; but in January 1996, the\r\n  Dighs learned that the leukemia had returned.Â  When they were about to exhaust\r\n  health insurance coverage for Shelley's medical expenses, the Dighs learned\r\n  that they would have to raise $250,000 for a second bone marrow transplant.Â  Among\r\n  their options for fund-raising was a proposal for the Fesmires to purchase the\r\n  Dighs' interest in the Myrtle Beach condominium.Â  George Digh's understanding\r\n  of the proposal was that both couples would agree on a value of $140,000 for\r\n  the condominium, with $70,000 attributable to each couple's interest in the\r\n  property, provided that the sale closed within thirty days.Â  According to George,\r\n  the Dighs wanted to impose a thirty-day deadline because time was of the\r\n  essence in raising funds for the bone marrow transplant.Â  George understood that\r\n  the amount due, after subtracting the Fesmires' share of the existing debt on\r\n  the property, was approximately $37,000.Â  However, no formal closing ever occurred.Â  \r\nAccording to Larry Fesmire, the proposal\r\n  that Shelley submitted to him was for a net amount due of $20,000 for the\r\n  Dighs' interest in the property.Â  Larry Fesmire's account of events includes\r\n  his payment of $20,000 in cash to Shelley during a visit to the Dighs' home in\r\n  April 1996.Â  He allegedly used a cigar box to carry the $20,000 in $100 denominations\r\n  to Shelley's bedroom where she was lying ill, and he allegedly placed the box\r\n  on Shelley's dresser.Â  \r\nShelley's\r\n  last mortgage payment was the April 1996 payment.Â  In May 1996, the Fesmires\r\n  took over the mortgage payments and started paying for all of the other\r\n  expenses associated with the property. Â  In July 1996, Shelley died.Â  Â Â \r\nIn April 1998, George Digh wrote a\r\n  letter to Larry Fesmire indicating his impression that Fesmire had never\r\n  completed the purchase of Digh's interest in the Myrtle Beach condominium.Â \r\n  Digh expressed his desire for Fesmire to complete the purchase of his interest\r\n  or for the condominium to be placed on the market for sale.Â  A few days later,\r\n  Fesmire responded to the letter with two alternative proposals:Â  (1) complete\r\n  the &quot;original agreement of March 1996&quot; by paying what Fesmire\r\n  considered to be the balance due on the net purchase price - $70,000 less the\r\n  $20,000 &quot;down payment paid in March of 1996,&quot; less Fesmire's share of\r\n  the debt on the property as of March 1996 ($33,000), for a net amount due of\r\n  $17,000; or (2) place the condominium on the market.Â  Fesmire indicated his\r\n  preference for the option of buying out Digh's interest.Â  Digh responded with\r\n  confusion over Fesmire's mention of a $20,000 payment.Â  \r\nThe parties engaged in several\r\n  unsuccessful efforts to resolve the matter, and the Fesmires eventually stopped\r\n  making the mortgage payments on the Myrtle Beach condominium; therefore, Digh\r\n  had to take up payments on the mortgage to prevent foreclosure.[1]Â \r\n  The Fesmires later filed an action against Digh seeking specific performance of\r\n  an alleged oral contract for the sale of the Dighs' interest in the condominium\r\n  for $20,000.Â  The Fesmires alleged that before Shelley's death, they had\r\n  entered into an oral contract with George and Shelley Digh for the sale of the\r\n  Dighs' interest in the condominium.Â  The complaint also requested the\r\n  alternative remedies of a partition and sale of the property and an\r\n  accounting.Â  Digh filed a counterclaim seeking damages for conversion and\r\n  seeking an accounting.Â  The matter was referred to the master-in-equity, who conducted\r\n  a bench trial and later issued an order granting specific performance of the\r\n  alleged oral contract.Â  Digh filed a motion for reconsideration, but the master\r\n  denied the motion.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in admitting into evidence \r\n\t\t\tredacted versions of two letters authored by counsel for the purpose of settlement \r\n\t\t\tnegotiations?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in granting specific performance \r\n\t\t\tof the alleged oral contract in violation of the Statute of Frauds, S.C.

J.

City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1976) (setting forth standards of\r\n  review to apply in actions at law and actions in equity).Â  \r\nIn an action at law, the trial\r\n  court's factual findings will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be\r\n  without evidence which reasonably supports the trial court's findings. Â Townes, 266\r\n  S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775. Â In\r\n  an action in equity, the appellate court may resolve questions of fact\r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. See \r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 324 S.C. 570,\r\n  577, 479 S.E.2d 510, 513&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1996) (citing Townes, 266\r\n  S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that because the master-in-equity heard the action, which was equitable in\r\n  nature, without appeal to the circuit court, the appellate court could find the\r\n  facts on appeal in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard the\r\n  findings at trial or to ignore the fact that the master was in a better\r\n  position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  \r\nLaughon v. O'Braitis,\r\n  360 S.C. 520, 524-25, 602 S.E.2d 108, 111&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004).Â  \r\nTo determine whether an action is legal\r\n  or equitable, this Court must look to the action's main purpose as reflected by\r\n  the nature of the pleadings, evidence, and character of the relief sought.Â  \r\nEx parte Wheeler v. Estate of Green, 381 S.C. 548, 673 S.E.2d 836, 839&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2009).Â  Here,\r\n  the Fesmires have asserted causes of action\r\n  for specific performance of an alleged oral contract, a partition, and an accounting.[2]Â  Our appellate courts have\r\n  traditionally viewed the main purpose of each of these causes of action as the\r\n  pursuit of equitable relief and thus have found these causes of action to be equitable\r\n  in nature.Â  See Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs., 340 S.C. 98,\r\n  105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 290-91 (2000) (applying the equitable standard of review\r\n  to the trial court's findings of fact in a specific performance action); Lowcountry Open Land Trust v.\r\n    Charleston S. Univ., 376 S.C. 399,\r\n  406, 656 S.E.2d 775, 779 (Ct. App.&nbsp;2008)&nbsp; (holding\r\n  that an action for specific performance lies in equity); \r\nLaughon,\r\n  360 S.C. at 524, 602 S.E.2d at 110 (holding that a partition action as well as an action for accounting is an action in equity); Settlemeyer v.\r\n    McCluney,\r\n  359 S.C. 317, 320, 596 S.E.2d 514, 516 (Ct.

Moore, 381 S.C. 179, 672 S.E.2d 571&nbsp;(2009), in which our Supreme\r\n  Court applied the legal standard of review to the trial court's findings of\r\n  fact in an action for specific performance of three written contracts for the\r\n  sale of land.Â  Because the contracts were in writing, their existence was not\r\n  in dispute and the statute of frauds was not raised as a defense.Â  Rather,\r\n  before determining the suitability of specific performance as a remedy, the\r\n  Court was required to interpret the written provisions of the\r\n  contracts.Â  Therefore, the Court determined that the action was an action to\r\n    construe a contract and that such an action was an action at law.Â  Id. at 185, 672 S.E.2d at 574.Â  Here, Digh disputed the very existence of a\r\n  contract with the specific terms asserted by the Fesmires, and he raised the\r\n  statute of frauds as a defense.Â  Therefore, the instant action cannot be\r\n  construed as an action to construe a contract. \r\nRather,\r\n  the circumstances of the instant action are virtually identical to those in Settlemeyer,\r\n  which involved an action for specific performance of an alleged oral contract\r\n  for the conveyance of land.Â  In its opinion in Settlemeyer, this Court\r\n  set forth the standard of review as follows: &quot;In an action in equity,\r\n  tried by the judge alone[] . . . this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Settlemeyer,\r\n  359 S.C. at 320, 596 S.E.2d at 516.Â  \r\nAs in the instant case, the\r\n  plaintiff in Settlemeyer alleged that his part performance of the\r\n  alleged oral contract removed it from the statute of frauds.Â  The Court treated\r\n  the existence of the alleged oral contract as a question of fact rather than a\r\n  question of law and stated, &quot;Based on our review of the evidence contained in the record, we hold Settlemeyer did not present clear evidence of\r\n  an oral agreement between the parties.&quot;Â  Id. at 321, 596\r\n  S.E.2d at 516 (emphasis added).Â  The Court cited Gibson v.\r\n    Hrysikos, 293 S.C. 8,\r\n  13-14, 358 S.E.2d 173, 176 (Ct. App. 1987) for the proposition that a\r\n  court must find, among other things, clear evidence of the existence of an oral\r\n  agreement for part performance to remove the contract from the statute of\r\n  frauds.Â  Id.Â  Likewise, in the instant case, this Court's review\r\n  of the master's factual findings on the existence of a contract, with the terms\r\n  asserted by the Fesmires, is governed by this Court's own view\r\n  of the evidence.[3] \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Redacted\r\n  Letters\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Fesmire introduced into evidence redacted versions of two letters\r\n  written by the parties' attorneys during settlement negotiations.Â  Digh argues\r\n  that the master erred in admitting these letters into evidence because their\r\n  introduction violates Rule 408, SCRE, which prohibits the introduction of\r\n  statements made in compromise negotiations.Â  Digh also argues that the master\r\n  exacerbated the prejudice to him by allowing Fesmire to redact most of the\r\n  contents of the letters because the redaction resulted in a false\r\n  interpretation of statements taken out of context.Â  We agree.\r\nPlaintiff's\r\n  Exhibit # 16 is a redacted version of a letter dated June 18, 2001, authored by Digh's former counsel and addressed to Larry Fesmire.Â  The redacted version presented\r\n  to the master reads as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\tDear Mr. Fesmire:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\t. . . \r\n\t\t$20,000.00Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  previously\r\n  given to Digh from Fesmire.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n  the unredacted version of the letter clearly indicates that the isolated phrase\r\n  presented in the redacted version was an assumption made for the purpose of\r\n  negotiating a settlement of the terms of a buyout and that it was inextricably\r\n  linked to the offer of settlement.Â  Notably, the following words appeared at\r\n  the top of the letter:Â  &quot;FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY.&quot;Â \r\n  Further, the isolated phrase in the redacted version was prefaced by the\r\n  following language:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e would offer the following\r\n  settlement:\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tOUT of Dighs [sic] $92,000.00 we will\r\n  subtract the following reimbursements to Fesmire: Â Â \r\n\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the letter also states the following:\r\n\r\n\tPlease note that\r\n  I have used the numbers you gave me as to the expenses being deducted from Mr.\r\n  Digh.Â  If this matter can not [sic] be settled as stated, I will need proof of\r\n  payments, mortgage history, tax returns for 1996 â€“ 2000 and Homeowner\r\n  Association invoices etc.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff's Exhibit # 17 is the redacted\r\n  version of a second letter dated August 23, 2001, also authored by Digh's\r\n  former counsel and addressed to Larry Fesmire.Â  The redacted version presented\r\n  to the master reads as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\tDear Mr. Fesmire:Â  \r\n\tPlease be advised that Forquer &amp;\r\n  Green does indeed represent the interest of Mr. George Digh in the\r\n  above-referenced matter. \r\n\t. . . \r\n\t$20,000.00\r\n  previously given to Digh from Fesmire.Â  \r\n\tPlease note that if this matter is not\r\n  settled, Digh will contest that the $20,000.00 was to be applied to this\r\n  transaction.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n  the unredacted version of the letter indicates that the isolated phrases presented\r\n  in the redacted version were assumptions made for the purpose of negotiating a\r\n  settlement and that they were inextricably linked to the offer of settlement.Â \r\n  The isolated phrases in the redacted version were prefaced by the following\r\n  language:\r\n\r\n\tI have reviewed the information you sent\r\n  me in response to the initial proposal and have incorporated your numbers into\r\n  my calculations.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t. . . \r\n\t\r\n\tFollowing the June 18th letter format out of Dighs [sic] $86,500.00 we will subtract the following\r\n  reimbursements to Fesmire:\r\n\r\nOnce\r\n  again, the settlement letter also states the following:\r\n\r\n\t[P]lease note this is Mr. Digh's final\r\n  attempt to settle this matter.Â  If this should fail, I will have no choice but\r\n  to follow Mr. Digh's instructions and file a Partition Action at which time I\r\n  will be requesting many financial documents from you . . . .\r\n\r\nClearly,\r\n  in both letters, the request of Digh's attorney for documentary proof of\r\n  Fesmire's financial contributions to the property, including the alleged\r\n  $20,000 payment for the Dighs' interest in the property, indicated that the\r\n  statements made in the letters were assumptions for settlement purposes only. \r\nThe\r\n  master concluded that the redacted versions of these letters were admissible\r\n  because they were admissions of fact and therefore were not privileged as\r\n  statements made in connection with settlement negotiations.Â  The master also\r\n  set forth the following additional grounds for the admissibility of the\r\n  redacted letters:Â  (1) the material did not constitute hearsay because it was\r\n  not offered for the truth of the matter asserted; (2) the material was not\r\n  hearsay because it qualified as an admission of a party-opponent; and (3) the\r\n  material qualified as a prior inconsistent statement of a witness under Rule\r\n  613(b), SCRE.Â  The master then concluded that the letters could be used to (1)\r\n  impeach Digh's testimony that he did not know about Fesmire's alleged payment\r\n  of $20,000; and (2) satisfy the writing requirement of the Statute of Frauds.Â  \r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  408, SCRE provides as follows:\r\n\tEvidence of (1)\r\n  furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or (2) accepting or offering\r\n    or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or\r\n  attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either\r\n  validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or\r\n  invalidity of the claim or its amount. Evidence of conduct or statements\r\n    made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does\r\n  not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because\r\n  it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does\r\n  not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as\r\n  proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay,\r\n  or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\n\r\n\tThis rule contemplates that the parties\r\n  need to feel free to make certain assumptions for the purpose of settlement\r\n  negotiations and that those statements are assumed by the author to be true\r\n  only for the purpose of compromise negotiations.Â  The rule codifies the\r\n  longstanding principle that evidence of conduct or statements made in\r\n  compromise negotiations is not admissible.Â  See QHG of Lake \r\n\tCity, Inc. v. McCutcheon, 360 S.C. 196, 209, 600 S.E.2d 105, 111&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004) (&quot;Because the law favors compromises, our\r\n  appellate courts have long held that testimony as to negotiations and offers to\r\n  compromise are inadmissible for proving liability.&quot;);\r\n\tCommerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W.\r\n    Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 558, 556 S.E.2d 718,&nbsp;725 (Ct. App.&nbsp;2001)&nbsp; (&quot;The courts favor compromise; accordingly,\r\n  evidence relating to settlements is generally not admissible to prove liability.&quot;); \r\n\tHunter v. Hyder, 236 S.C. 378, 387, 114 S.E.2d 493, 497&nbsp;(1960) (&quot;[C]ompromises are favored and evidence of an offer or attempt\r\n  to compromise or settle a matter in dispute cannot be given in evidence against\r\n  the party by whom such offer or attempt was made. &quot;).Â  \r\n\r\nThe statements highlighted in the\r\n  redacted versions of the settlement letters admitted into evidence in this case\r\n  were undoubtedly &quot;statements made in compromise negotiations.&quot;Â  When\r\n  these respective statements are viewed in the context of the unredacted version\r\n  of the letters, it is clear that the references to the alleged $20,000 payment\r\n  were assumptions made for purposes of negotiating a compromise settlement.Â  The\r\n  references were inextricably linked to the offer of settlement.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  the master's citation to McCormick on Evidence in Conclusion of Law # 6\r\n  is incomplete.Â  In this conclusion, the master cites the treatise for the\r\n  proposition that an admission of fact in the course of negotiations is not\r\n  privileged.Â  However, the McCormick treatise significantly qualifies that\r\n  proposition.Â  2 McCormick on Evidence Â§ 266 (6th ed. 2006) (discussing\r\n  the trend to extend the protection to all statements made in compromise\r\n  negotiations and discouraging the use of inconsistent statements made in\r\n  compromise negotiations for general impeachment of the testimony). Â Therefore,\r\n  the master's reliance on this treatise excerpt to support the admission of the\r\n  redacted settlement letters into evidence is misplaced.Â  \r\nIn fact, the master's use of the\r\n  redacted letters exhibits the very danger highlighted in the McCormick treatise\r\n  because it constitutes a misuse of allegedly &quot;prior inconsistent\r\n  statements&quot; to prove liability.[4]Â \r\n  The master's order uses the material from the redacted letters under the guise\r\n  of impeachment of Digh's credibility to bolster Fesmire's version of the\r\n  parties' contract.Â  Therefore, the admission of these letters into evidence\r\n  violated Rule 408, SCRE, as they were offered in compromise negotiations.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  regardless of whether the master used the redacted letters for impeachment\r\n  purposes or to satisfy the writing requirement of the Statute of Frauds, the\r\n  statements in the letters were undoubtedly offered for the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted because they were offered to show that Larry Fesmire paid $20,000 to\r\n  the Dighs for their interest in the condominium.Â  Further, the statements in\r\n  the settlement letters were not admissions of a party-opponent because they\r\n  were assumptions made for the purpose of negotiating a compromise settlement.Â \r\n  Therefore, contrary to the master's conclusion, the disputed material\r\n  constituted inadmissible hearsay.Â  See Rule 802, SCRE.\r\nMoreover, the admission of the redacted\r\n  letters into evidence clearly prejudiced Digh because the master used this\r\n  evidence to support his conclusion that the alleged oral contract asserted by\r\n  the Fesmires satisfied the Statute of Frauds.Â  This undoubtedly affected the\r\n  outcome of the case.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the master committed prejudicial error in admitting the\r\n  redacted settlement letters into evidence.\r\nII.&nbsp; Specific\r\n  Performance\r\nDigh\r\n  argues that the master erred in granting specific performance of the alleged\r\n  oral contract because the Fesmires' action is barred by the Statute of Frauds, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  32-3-10(4) (2007).Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nSpecific\r\n  performance should be granted only if there is no adequate remedy at law and\r\n  specific enforcement of the contract is equitable between the parties.Â  Ingram, 340 S.C. at 105-06,\r\n  531 S.E.2d at 291. Â Here, the master\r\n  concluded that the settlement correspondence of Digh's counsel was sufficient\r\n  to satisfy the writing requirement of the Statute of Frauds.Â  In the\r\n  alternative, the master concluded that even if there was not a writing that was\r\n  sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, the Fesmires' part performance of\r\n  the contract took it out of the purview of the Statute of Frauds.Â  Digh argues\r\n  that the master erred in making these conclusions.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Statute of Frauds provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\tNo action shall be brought\r\n  whereby:\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tÂ (4) To charge any person\r\n  upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest\r\n  in or concerning them . . . \r\n\tUnless the agreement upon\r\n  which such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof \r\n\tshall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged\r\n  therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(4) (2007) (emphasis added).\r\nA.&nbsp; Settlement correspondence\r\nThe\r\n  settlement correspondence of Digh's counsel could not satisfy the writing\r\n  requirement of the Statute of Frauds because the very admission of those\r\n  letters into evidence violated Rule 408, SCRE, which prohibits the\r\n  admission of statements made in compromise\r\n  negotiations,\r\n  and violated Rule 802, SCRE, which generally prohibits the admission of hearsay\r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Part Performance\r\nFurther, when\r\n  there is no writing, but part performance is alleged to remove an oral contract\r\n  from the Statute of Frauds, a court of equity must find the following\r\n  factors before it may compel specific performance of the\r\n  oral contract: 1) clear evidence of an oral contract; 2) the contract had been partially executed; and\r\n  3) the party who requested performance had completed or was willing to complete\r\n  his part of the oral contract.Â  Settlemeyer,\r\n  359 S.C. at 320, 596 S.E.2d at 516.Â  In Scurry\r\n    v. Edwards, 232 S.C. 53, 61, 100 S.E.2d 812, 816-17 (1957), the Court\r\n  explained the nature of the part performance exception to the Statute of\r\n  Frauds:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he courts [will] require specific&nbsp;performance\r\n  of an oral contract for the conveyance of land, where the terms of the contract\r\n  are clear, definite and certain and are established by competent and\r\n  satisfactory proof, and where the party seeking to rescue it from the statute\r\n  shows such acts of performance or part performance on his part, clearly and\r\n    unequivocally referable to such agreement, as would render application of\r\n  the statute unconscionable. Â Payment of the purchase price in whole or part\r\n    is not of itself regarded as such part performance as will take the contract\r\n  out of the statute and the fact that no part of the purchase price has been\r\n  paid does not necessarily require application of the statute. Â Mere change\r\n    of possession is not necessarily sufficient to avoid the consequences of the\r\n    statute; like payment of the purchase price, it is a fact to be considered\r\n  in connection with the other facts and circumstances of the transaction in\r\n  determining whether or not there has been such performance or part performance\r\n  as warrants relief from the statute. Â Likewise, the fact that improvements have\r\n  been made on the property after possession, while strong evidence of part\r\n  performance, is neither conclusive of that issue nor indispensable proof of it. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nScurry, 232 S.C. at 61, 100 S.E.2d at 816-17 (internal\r\n  citations omitted) (emphasis added).\r\n1.&nbsp; No\r\n  clear evidence\r\nInitially,\r\n  there is no clear evidence of a contract with the specific termsÂ  asserted by\r\n  the Fesmires.Â  Therefore, specific performance is not an appropriate remedy\r\n  because the Fesmires have not satisfied the first prong of the part performance\r\n  exception to the Statute of Frauds.Â  See Settlemeyer, 359 S.C. at\r\n  320, 596 S.E.2d at 516 (holding that to compel specific performance of an oral\r\n  agreement where part performance is alleged to remove the contract from the\r\n  Statute of Frauds, a court of equity must find: 1) clear evidence of an oral\r\n  agreement; 2) the agreement had been partially executed; and 3) the party who\r\n  requested performance had completed or was willing to complete his part of the\r\n  oral agreement). Â \r\nThe testimony\r\n  concerning the terms of the alleged oral contract was very contradictory, and\r\n  the Fesmires' evidence of the existence of a contract with the specific terms\r\n  asserted by them rested on the following questionable evidence: Â (1) improperly\r\n  admitted statements taken out of the context of settlement negotiations; and\r\n  (2) the self-serving testimony of Larry Fesmire regarding alleged statements of\r\n  Shelley Digh, a woman who died before the Fesmires brought this action. Â Assuming,\r\n  without deciding, that the Dead Man's Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-11-20 (1985), did not render Fesmire\r\n  incompetent to testify as to any transaction with Shelley Digh, this statute\r\n  addresses merely the competency of the witness and not the weight that should\r\n  be given to such testimony\r\n  in any particular case.Â  Here, we view the testimony as suspect and do not\r\n  accord it much weight. \r\nIn\r\n  sum, the Fesmires have not satisfied the first prong of the standard for compelling\r\n  specific performance where part performance is alleged to remove an oral agreement\r\n  from the Statute of Frauds because they have not presented clear evidence of an\r\n  oral agreement. \r\n2.&nbsp; No partial\r\n  execution \r\nAs\r\n  to the second prong\r\n  of the standard for compelling specific performance where part performance is alleged to remove an\r\n  oral agreement from the Statute of Frauds, the evidence does not indicate that\r\n  the Fesmires partially executed the alleged agreement.Â  There is no clear\r\n  evidence that the Fesmires paid $20,000 to the Dighs.[5]Â \r\n  Further, the Fesmires' mortgage payments, possession of the condominium, and\r\n  any alleged improvements to the condominium were not necessarily indicators of\r\n  part performance because their existing partial ownership interest in the condominium\r\n  already provided them with a reason to take those actions.Â  See Scurry, 232 S.C. at 61, 100 S.E.2d at 816-17 (requiring that the party seeking to rescue an alleged oral contract from the Statute of\r\n  Frauds show such acts of performance or part performance that are &quot;clearly\r\n  and unequivocally referable to such agreement&quot; and that would render\r\n  application of the statute unconscionable).Â  \r\nMoreover, these actions could have been\r\n  consistent with Digh's version of the parties' contract and subsequent events,\r\n  despite the expiration of the thirty-day deadline for closing the sale.[6] Â Therefore, these\r\n  actions are not probative of the specific contract terms alleged by the\r\n  Fesmires.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; No\r\n  evidence of willingness\r\n    to complete\r\nThe Fesmires also failed to satisfy the third prong of the standard for compelling\r\n  specific performance where part performance is alleged to remove an oral\r\n  agreement from the Statute of Frauds because the evidence does not indicate\r\n  that Larry Fesmire was willing to complete his part of the alleged agreement. Â He\r\n  stopped making mortgage payments in July 2002, forcing Digh to take over the\r\n  mortgage payments and to pay off the balance of the debt secured by the\r\n  mortgage.Â  In fact, Larry Fesmire admitted that he abandoned the mortgage\r\n  payments so that he could purchase the property at a foreclosure sale.Â  We find\r\n  that Larry Fesmire's behavior is inconsistent with a good faith intent to\r\n  complete his part of the alleged agreement.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nBased on the foregoing, the master erred\r\n  in granting specific performance of the alleged oral contract.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Partition\r\n  and Accounting\r\nDigh\r\n  argues that the master should have granted the parties' requests for a\r\n  partition and accounting.[7]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  remedy of partition is provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-10 (2005):\r\n\r\n\tAll joint\r\n  tenants and tenants in common who hold, jointly or in common, for a term of\r\n  life or years or of whom one has an estate for a term of life or years with the\r\n  other that has an estate of inheritance or freehold in any lands, tenements or\r\n  hereditaments shall be compellable to make severance and partition of all such\r\n  lands, tenements and hereditaments.\r\n\r\nFurther,\r\n  section 15-61-50\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides for partition by sale when partition\r\n  in kind is not practical:\r\n\r\n\tThe court of\r\n  common pleas has jurisdiction in all cases of real and personal estates held in\r\n  joint tenancy or in common to make partition in kind or by allotment to one or\r\n  more of the parties upon their accounting to the other parties in interest for\r\n  their respective shares or, in case partition in kind or by allotment cannot be\r\n  fairly and impartially made and without injury to any of the parties in\r\n  interest, by the sale of the property and the division of the proceeds\r\n  according to the rights of the parties.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ordinarily, partition is\r\n  compellable among co-tenants as a matter of right . . . Â and is not suspended\r\n  by an interest in or a right to use the property.&quot;Â  \r\nThompson v. Brunson,\r\n  283 S.C. 221, 225, 321 S.E.2d 622, 624&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1984) (internal citations &amp; quotations omitted).[8]Â  \r\nHere, the Fesmires did not clearly establish the specific terms of their alleged contract\r\n  for the purchase of the Dighs' interest in the condominium.Â  Because they did\r\n  not satisfy the Statute of Frauds, specific performance was not an appropriate\r\n  remedy.Â  Further, the Fesmires requested partition as an alternative remedy and\r\n  Digh also requested partition, a remedy to which the parties are entitled under\r\n  sections 15-61-10 and -50.[9]Â \r\n  Therefore, the master erred in failing to grant a partition and accounting.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the master's order granting\r\n  specific performance is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the master\r\n  for an accounting and partition by sale.[10] \r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Larry Fesmire\r\n  testified that he abandoned the mortgage payments so that the property would go\r\n  into foreclosure and he could then buy the property at a foreclosure sale.Â  \r\n[2] Digh has asserted counterclaims for conversion, breach of\r\n  contract, and an accounting.Â  However, there are no issues on appeal involving\r\n  Digh's conversion and breach of contract claims.Â  \r\n[3] During oral\r\n  arguments, counsel for the parties agreed that an equitable standard of review\r\n  is proper. \r\n[4] Notably, the\r\n  federal ruleâ€™s prohibition against using evidence of settlement negotiations for\r\n  impeachment through a prior inconsistent statement is explicit.Â  Rule 408, FRE,\r\n  provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(a)&nbsp; Prohibited uses.â€”Evidence of the\r\n  following is not admissible on behalf of any party, when offered to prove\r\n  liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to\r\n  validity or amount, or to impeach through a prior inconsistent statement or\r\n    contradiction:(1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnishâ€”or accepting or offering or\r\n  promising to acceptâ€”a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to\r\n  compromise the claim; and(2) conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim,\r\n  except when offered in a criminal case and the negotiations related to a claim\r\n  by a public office or agency in the exercise of regulatory, investigative, or\r\n  enforcement authority.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n[5] The only\r\n  evidence of the Fesmires' payment is Larry Fesmire's testimony that he took\r\n  $20,000 in cash to Shelley Digh.Â  Larry Fesmire's wife, who accompanied him on\r\n  that visit, could not even corroborate this testimony.Â  This testimony hardly\r\n  rises to the level justifying specific performance.Â  See \r\nPennington v. Pennington,\r\n  89 S.C. 277, 279, 71 S.E. 825, 825&nbsp;(1911) (holding that in an action of\r\n  specific performance of an alleged oral contract for the conveyance of land, the\r\n  burden was on the plaintiffs to prove payment of the purchase money in full\r\n  before they could ask that the defendant be required to convey).Â  \r\n[6] Digh understood\r\n  that the Fesmires were to pay the Dighs $37,000 to purchase their interest and\r\n  that the closing was to take place within 30 days.Â  Digh indicated in later\r\n  correspondence that he was not aware of a $20,000 payment, and he testified\r\n  that no closing ever took place.Â  He also indicated that he continued to allow\r\n  the Fesmires to make the mortgage payments because of their existing interest\r\n  in the condominium.Â  \r\n[7] In their\r\n  complaint, the Fesmires requested partition as an alternative remedy.Â  Digh's\r\n  answer stated that he agreed that the property should be partitioned but that\r\n  the proceeds should not be distributed as suggested by the Fesmires.Â  Digh also\r\n  interposed a counterclaim for an accounting.Â  Digh's motion to alter or amend\r\n  the master's order included the argument that the master erred in failing to\r\n  rule on the alternative remedy of a partition and that partition should be\r\n  granted.Â  \r\n[8] In Smith v.\r\n  Cutler, 366 S.C. 546, 550, 623 S.E.2d 644, 647&nbsp;(2005), our Supreme Court held that the deed in that case created a tenancy in common\r\n  with a right of survivorship and that the survivorship rights between the tenants\r\n  created true future interests in the entire estate that could not be destroyed\r\n  by the unilateral act of one tenant through an act such as partition.\r\nÂ Here,\r\n  however, the language in the deed to the Dighs and the Fesmires does not\r\n  indicate any special right of survivorship.Â  The grantor conveyed the\r\n  condominium to &quot;George B. Digh, Shelley K. Digh, Larry L. Fesmire, Jr. and\r\n  Teresa Fesmire, their heirs and assigns, forever . . . .&quot;Â  \r\n[9] The parties'\r\n  agreement as to their respective rights in the property does not\r\n  conflict with the statutory remedy of partition.Â  The agreement includes a right\r\n  of first refusal provision:Â  &quot;In the event that one couple wishes to get\r\n  out of this venture the other couple has the first right of refusal [sic] to\r\n  purchase the other's interest for whatever the cash basis is in the\r\n  property.&quot;Â  The\r\n  agreement also provides, &quot;In the event of death of any of the four people,\r\n  the remaining spouse can continue to own the Â½ share unless she/he wishes to\r\n  sell, where the remaining couple will have the first right of refusal [sic] and\r\n  can purchase said interest for the cash basis in the property.&quot;Â  \r\n[10] In view of our\r\n  disposition of the foregoing issues, we decline to address Digh's remaining issues.&nbsp; See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that the appellate court need not\r\n  review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive\r\n  of the appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4550","title":"Mungo v.

Â Commissioner\r\n  Lyndon proceeded with the hearing without any use or consideration of Dr.\r\n  Snoderly's office notes or records.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter considering\r\n  the other documents and testimony presented by both parties, Commissioner\r\n  Lyndon found Claimant reached MMI on May 2, 2003, making her ineligible for any\r\n  further medical treatment.Â  Claimant was found to have sustained a forty\r\n  percent partial disability from the original injury.Â  Commissioner Lyndon allowed\r\n  Employer to discontinue payments to Claimant for temporary total disability\r\n  benefits and ordered any payments already made after the date of MMI to be\r\n  applied against Claimant's permanent partial disability award.Â  Employer was\r\n  additionally ordered to pay for all of Claimant's causally-related and\r\n  authorized medical treatment through May 2, 2003.Â  Neither party appealed this\r\n  decision.Â  \r\nOn July 23, 2004,\r\n  Claimant filed a Form 50, Request for Hearing, alleging a change of condition\r\n  to her cervical spine and development of problems with her neck, right\r\n  shoulder, right arm, and significant psychological conditions.Â  A hearing was\r\n  held before Commissioner Alan Bass on March 3, 2005.Â  Commissioner Bass denied\r\n  Claimant's request for benefits for a change of condition, and he filed his\r\n  order on October 24, 2005.Â  Significantly, however, Commissioner Bass stated: \r\n\r\n  I find\r\n    that Claimant has not sustained a change of condition from an orthopaedic\r\n    standpoint.Â  That said, I must say that, if Dr. Snoderly's exam and diagnoses .\r\n    . . could be taken into account, I would have found a [c]hange of [c]ondition\r\n    because of (1) Cervical facet joint syndrome; (2) Spasm absent in visits prior\r\n    to hearing [on June 10, 2003]; and (3) Loss of strength from [5 out of 5\r\n    strength] to [2 out of 5 strength].Â  I find, as a matter of law, that because\r\n    Dr. Snoderly's diagnoses were made prior to the hearing, they cannot be\r\n    considered for [c]hange of [c]ondition.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nCommissioner Bass\r\n  additionally stated, &quot;The Claimant may not now raise the issue of\r\n  depression when she could have done so [at the] last hearing.&quot;Â Â Â Â  \r\nClaimant\r\n  filed a Form 30, Request for Commission Review, alleging eighteen errors of\r\n  law, and the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission (the\r\n  Appellate Panel) affirmed Commissioner Bass's decision and order in all\r\n  respects.Â  Thereafter, Claimant appealed the Appellate Panel's decision to the\r\n  circuit court.Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing a\r\n  hearing, the circuit court reversed Commissioner Bass's findings Claimant had\r\n  not proven a change of condition for the worse of her cervical spine and\r\n  Claimant had not proven entitlement to psychological benefits.Â  The circuit\r\n  court found Claimant's original award from the June 10, 2003 hearing was based\r\n  on medical records created on or before May 2, 2003, the date of MMI.Â \r\n  Therefore, Commissioner Bass erred in stating he could not consider records\r\n  created between May 2, 2003, and June 10, 2003, at the change of condition hearing.Â \r\n  The circuit court additionally noted &quot;the reliable, probative and\r\n  substantial evidence of record proves that any symptoms of depression or other\r\n  psychological conditions before the first hearing were mild, undiagnosed and\r\n  untreated; and became full-blown thereafter, meeting formal diagnostic criteria\r\n  and necessitating formal treatment by [the doctor] only after the first\r\n  hearing[,]&quot; meaning Claimant could not have raised the issue of depression\r\n  at the June 10, 2003 hearing.Â  The circuit court, therefore, remanded the case\r\n  to the single commissioner to determine the precise benefits owed to Claimant\r\n  for her change of condition and for her psychological condition.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (the APA) establishes the standard of judicial\r\n  review for appeals from the Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission).Â  Jones v. Harold Arnold's Sentry Buick, Pontiac, 376 S.C. 375, 378, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 772, 774 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Under the scope of review established in the\r\n  APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel\r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse where\r\n  the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Hall v. United Rentals, Inc.,\r\n  371 S.C. 69, 79, 636 S.E.2d 876, 882 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  This Court's review is,\r\n  therefore, limited to determining whether the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Corbin\r\n    v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs a threshold\r\n  matter, we must determine the appealability of the circuit court's order.Â  This\r\n  Court has held &quot;that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for\r\n  additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly\r\n  appealable.&quot;Â  Foggie v. Gen. Elec. Co., 376 S.C. 384, 388, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 395, 398 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  However, if the circuit court's order is a\r\n  final judgment, then it is immediately appealable.Â  Id. at 389, 656\r\n  S.E.2d at 398.Â  &quot;Generally, an order is a final judgment on one or more\r\n  issues if it constitutes an ultimate decision on the merits.&quot;Â  Brown v.\r\n    Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 387, 622 S.E.2d 546, 551 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  &quot;An order involves the merits if it finally determines some\r\n  substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense\r\n  in the case.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the current case,\r\n  the circuit court ruled it was error for Commissioner Bass and the Appellate Panel\r\n  (1) to exclude Dr. Snoderly's records from the change of condition hearing and\r\n  (2) to not consider Claimant's psychological claims at the change of condition\r\n  hearing.Â  These rulings led the circuit court to order a reversal of the Appellate\r\n  Panel's conclusions that Claimant had not proven a change of condition for the\r\n  worse of her cervical spine involving problems with the neck, right shoulder,\r\n  and right arm and Claimant had not proven entitlement to psychological\r\n  benefits.Â  The circuit court remanded the case to the single commissioner for a\r\n  determination of what precise benefits were due to Claimant for her change of\r\n  condition of her cervical spine and for her psychological conditions.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court's\r\n  order mandates an award for change of condition to the cervical spine and for\r\n  psychological benefits.Â  This ruling is a decision on the merits because it\r\n  decides with finality whether Claimant proved these changes in her condition.Â \r\n  Although the circuit court remanded the issue of the precise damages to be\r\n  awarded to Claimant, the single commissioner would have no choice but to award\r\n  some damages to Claimant.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court's order constitutes a\r\n  final decision and is appealable.Â  See id. at 388, 622 S.E.2d at\r\n  551 (finding that because the circuit court's order mandated apportionment, the\r\n  court left the percentage of apportionment to the Commission on remand, so the\r\n  Appellate Panel would have no choice but to allocate some part of the\r\n  claimant's disability to the non-compensable cause, thus the circuit court's\r\n  order constituted a final decision on the issue of apportionment, making it\r\n  appealable).Â  \r\nFinding Employer's\r\n  appeal is properly before us, we now address the merits of Employer's\r\n  arguments.Â  Employer first argues the circuit court erred in reversing the Appellate\r\n  Panel's determination that Claimant did not sustain a change of condition for\r\n  the worse.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  determination of whether a claimant experiences a change of condition is a question\r\n  for the fact finder.&quot;Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW No. 10420, 353\r\n  S.C. 100, 107, 576 S.E.2d 191, 194 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The Appellate Panel is the\r\n  ultimate fact finder in workers' compensation cases, and if its findings are\r\n  supported by substantial evidence, it is not within our province to reverse\r\n  those findings.Â  Robbins v. Walgreens &amp; Broadspire Servs., Inc., 375\r\n  S.C. 259, 264, 652 S.E.2d 90, 93 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence\r\n  is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable\r\n  minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nGenerally, an\r\n  appeal of a workers' compensation order is concerned with the conditions prior\r\n  to and at the time of the original award, while review for a change of\r\n  condition is concerned with conditions that have arisen thereafter.Â  Gattis,\r\n  353 S.C. at 109, 576 S.E.2d at 195.Â  Review of an award through a change of\r\n  condition hearing is not an alternative to or substitute for an appeal, but if\r\n  a claimant can show a change of condition, the award may be reviewed and either\r\n  increased, diminished, or terminated by the Appellate Panel.Â  Id.Â  \r\n&quot;A change in\r\n  condition occurs when the claimant experiences a change in physical condition\r\n  as a result of her original injury, occurring after the first award.&quot;Â  Id. at 109, 576 S.E.2d at 196.Â  When the original order is limited to a\r\n  determination of the claimant's condition as of a specific date, it is\r\n  appropriate for the Appellate Panel to then consider any subsequent events or\r\n  diagnoses made after that date when making a determination about an alleged\r\n  change of condition.Â  See id. at 109, 576 S.E.2d at 195-96\r\n  (&quot;Because the [C]omission limited its order to a determination of\r\n  Claimant's condition prior to August of 1998, subsequent events, including [the\r\n  doctor's] changed diagnosis in August of 1998, were appropriate for\r\n  consideration in an action alleging a change of condition.&quot;); see also Clark v. Aiken County Gov't, 366 S.C. 102, 110, 620 S.E.2d 99, 103 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005) (explaining Gattis held &quot;because the [Appellate Panel]\r\n  limited its initial order to a determination of the claimant's condition prior\r\n  to the advent of the evidence in question, the evidence was appropriate for the\r\n  change of condition proceeding&quot;).Â  Review of an award at a change of\r\n  condition hearing is, therefore, concerned with the date as of which the\r\n  claimant's condition was determined rather than the date of the actual hearing\r\n  in which that award was rendered.Â  See Gattis, 353 S.C. at 109,\r\n  576 S.E.2d at 195-96 (finding it appropriate for the Appellate Panel to\r\n  consider the doctor's August 18, 1998 letter at the change of condition hearing\r\n  when it made a determination at the initial hearing based on the facts and\r\n  circumstances considered by the single commissioner at the August 19, 1998\r\n  hearing, which did not include the doctor's August 18 letter).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe original\r\n  hearing concerning Claimant's injury was held before Commissioner Lyndon on\r\n  June 10, 2003.Â  One week prior, on June 3, 2003, Dr. Snoderly examined Claimant\r\n  concerning the continuing pain she was experiencing because of her injury.Â  Dr.\r\n  Snoderly's records were not available to be offered as exhibits until June 6,\r\n  2003, at which time they were promptly turned over to Employer.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, Employer objected to the admission of the records because they were\r\n  not timely submitted.Â  Commissioner Lyndon sustained this objection and\r\n  excluded the records.Â  Commissioner Lyndon did not consider Dr. Snoderly's records\r\n  at the hearing or when making his final order and, instead, based his findings\r\n  and conclusions on medical records created on or prior to May 2, 2003, when Dr.\r\n  Edwards released Claimant as being at MMI.Â Â Â  \r\nA change of\r\n  condition hearing was then held before Commissioner Bass on March 2, 2005.Â  In\r\n  his order, Commissioner Bass stated: \r\n\r\n  [I]f\r\n    Dr. Snoderly's exam and diagnoses . . . could be taken into account, I would\r\n    have found a [c]hange of [c]ondition because of (1) Cervical facet joint\r\n    syndrome; (2) Spasm absent in visits prior to hearing; and (3) Loss of strength\r\n    from 5/5 to 2/5.Â  I find, as a matter of law, that because Dr. Snoderly's\r\n    diagnoses were made prior to the hearing, they cannot be considered for\r\n    [c]hange of [c]ondition. \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel fully adopted this finding.Â Â Â  \r\nPursuant to Gattis,\r\n  this conclusion is erroneous.Â  Although Dr. Snoderly's diagnoses were made and\r\n  recorded prior to Claimant's initial hearing, her records were excluded as\r\n  untimely and not considered or factored into Commissioner Lyndon's award.Â \r\n  Commissioner Lyndon specifically stated Claimant's award was based on her\r\n  condition as of May 2, 2003, the date Dr. Edwards found Claimant reached MMI.Â \r\n  The appropriate date from which the single commissioner should evaluate a\r\n  change in Claimant's condition is therefore May 2, 2003, not June 10, 2003, the\r\n  date of the hearing.Â  Dr. Snoderly's diagnoses were not made prior to May 2,\r\n  2003, and therefore, her records should have been considered at the change of\r\n  condition hearing.Â  \r\nGiving effect to\r\n  the correction of that legal error, and by the plain language in Commissioner\r\n  Bass' order, which was fully adopted by the Appellate Panel, the circuit court\r\n  found that the single commissioner and the Appellate Panel would have found as\r\n  a fact that Claimant sustained a change of condition.Â  The circuit court then\r\n  found &quot;[t]he reliable, probative and substantial evidence of record\r\n  supports that finding.&quot;Â  After our review of the record, including Dr.\r\n  Snoderly's office notes and records, we find substantial evidence supports the\r\n  Appellate Panel's finding that Claimant sustained a change of condition. Â We,\r\n  therefore, affirm the order of the circuit court finding Claimant proved a\r\n  change of condition for the worse.\r\nEmployer next\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in awarding Claimant benefits for psychological\r\n  conditions because substantial evidence proves such conditions existed prior to\r\n  the original hearing and because Claimant failed to present sufficient evidence\r\n  to support the change of condition claim.Â  We agree in part and remand the\r\n  issue to the Commission.Â  \r\nJust as physical\r\n  changes of condition are properly considered when reviewing a claimant's\r\n  initial award, so too are mental changes of condition.Â  Estridge v. Joslyn\r\n    Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 537-38, 482 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997).Â  If the mental condition is causally connected to the original injury,\r\n  is a newly manifested symptom of that injury, and has caused a worsening of the\r\n  claimant's condition, then it is proper for the single commissioner to consider\r\n  the mental condition at a change of condition hearing.Â  Id. at 538, 482\r\n  S.E.2d at 580.Â  \r\nA\r\n  mental condition is causally related to the original injury if the condition\r\n  was induced by the physical injury.Â  Id.Â  The mental condition would be\r\n  a new symptom manifesting from the same harm to the body, and &quot;[i]n such\r\n  circumstances, it may properly be compensated in a change of condition\r\n  proceeding as a part of the original injury.&quot;Â  Id. at 538-39, 482\r\n  S.E.2d at 581.Â  Additionally, &quot;[a] symptom which is present and causally\r\n  connected, but found not to impact upon the claimant's condition at the time of\r\n  the original award, may later manifest itself in full bloom and thereby worsen\r\n  his or her condition[,]&quot; and such an occurrence is one of the reasons the\r\n  Commission may review awards through change of condition hearings.Â  Id. at 540, 482 S.E.2d at 581.Â  Therefore, even if the mental condition was not\r\n  raised at the original hearing, it may be raised at the change of condition\r\n  hearing.Â  Id. \r\nClaimant did not\r\n  seek benefits for any mental condition in her original Form 50, and therefore,\r\n  Claimant's initial award was based solely on her physical injuries.Â  Prior to\r\n  May 2, 2003, the date used by Commissioner Lyndon to assess Claimant's\r\n  condition, no physician had diagnosed Claimant with depression or any other\r\n  psychological condition.Â  In September 2001, Dr. William Stewart, a certified\r\n  rehabilitation counselor and certified vocational evaluator, evaluated Claimant\r\n  and noted Claimant's test results indicated &quot;a mild level of\r\n  depression&quot; and &quot;a minimal level of anxiety.&quot;Â  Dr. Stewart,\r\n  however, did not diagnose Claimant with any psychological condition or provide\r\n  any treatment following this evaluation.Â Â  Â Â \r\nNot\r\n  until February 3, 2004, did a physician, Dr. Snoderly, formally recognize\r\n  Claimant's problems with any psychological condition and refer her to a mental\r\n  health professional for evaluation and treatment.Â  Dr. Snoderly noted at her\r\n  initial meeting and examination of Claimant on June 3, 2003, that\r\n  &quot;[Claimant] does state the pain has definitely affected her ability to\r\n  sleep, be physically active, and concentrate.Â  It has affected her emotionally\r\n  and also has affected her social relationships.&quot;Â  Dr. Snoderly, however,\r\n  did not recommend any further evaluation or treatment for Claimant and made no\r\n  diagnosis of depression at that examination.Â  Additionally, these records were\r\n  not considered by Commissioner Lyndon when making the initial award.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  Dr. Snoderly's records from Claimant's February 3, 2004 examination, Dr.\r\n  Snoderly stated: \r\n\r\n  [Claimant]\r\n    did confide in me today that she is feeling a little depressed.Â  She has never\r\n    really had a problem with depression, but after this injury and the continued\r\n    problems that she has been having, she does have some feelings of depression.Â \r\n    She and I did discuss having her referred to Dr. A.J. Rainwater . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Snoderly later clarified\r\n  her referral stating, &quot;I became concerned since the [June 10, 2003]\r\n  hearing about the psychological effects of [Claimant's] chronic pain.Â  I have\r\n  thus referred her to [Dr. Rainwater], a psychologist in Florence for\r\n  evaluation, treatment and biofeedback.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nThereafter, Claimant visited Dr. Rainwater on March 3,\r\n  2004.Â  Following this evaluation, Dr. Rainwater diagnosed Claimant with (1)\r\n  depression secondary to chronic pain, (2) mixed pain disorder with conversion\r\n  dynamics, (3) insomnia secondary to pain, and (4) hypolibido secondary to\r\n  pain.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn February 4,\r\n  2005, Claimant was evaluated by Dr. Robert Brabham, a psychologist.Â  Dr.\r\n  Brabham found Claimant's pain disorder was worsening instead of improving, her\r\n  depression was worsening with the continuation of pain and her inability to\r\n  function, and her anxiety concerning her future financial expenses was\r\n  considerable.Â  Dr. Brabham then diagnosed Claimant with (1) pain disorder\r\n  associated with both psychological factors and a generalized medical condition;\r\n  (2) depressive disorder, secondary to on-the-job injuries; and (3) generalized\r\n  anxiety disorder, secondary to on-the-job injuries.Â  Dr. Brabham concluded his\r\n  report by stating that it was &quot;[his] opinion that [Claimant's] conditions\r\n  have indeed deteriorated since the time of her Worker's Compensation hearing in\r\n  2003.&quot;Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter hearing and\r\n  reviewing all of this evidence, Commissioner Bass found Claimant could not\r\n  raise the issue of depression at the change of condition hearing because she\r\n  failed to raise that issue at the initial hearing.Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n  affirmed this ruling.Â  The circuit court reversed, finding the holding was\r\n  controlled by an error of law and the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n  evidence of record supported a finding that Claimant was entitled to benefits\r\n  for her psychological conditions.Â  \r\nPursuant to Estridge,\r\n  we find the circuit court was correct to hold the single commissioner and the Appellate\r\n  Panel committed legal error in ruling they could not consider the issue of\r\n  depression raised by Claimant at the change of condition hearing.Â  325 S.C. at\r\n  538-39, 482 S.E.2d at 580-81 (&quot;A [mental] condition which is induced by a\r\n  physical injury, is thereby causally related to that injury[, and] . . . may\r\n  properly be compensated in a change of condition proceeding as a part of the\r\n  original injury.&quot;).Â  Claimant could raise the issue of depression at the\r\n  change of condition hearing because the psychological condition was induced by\r\n  the original physical injury and any symptoms of depression she experienced\r\n  prior to the June 3, 2003 hearing were mild, undiagnosed, and untreated.Â  See id., 325 S.C. at 540, 482 S.E.2d at 581 (&quot;A symptom which is\r\n  present and causally connected, but found not to impact upon the claimant's\r\n  condition at the time of the original award, may later manifest itself in full\r\n  bloom and thereby worsen his or her condition.Â  Such an occurrence is within\r\n  the reasons for the code section involving a change of condition.&quot;).Â \r\n  Further, because Claimant did not raise the issue of depression in her original\r\n  Form 50 or at the initial hearing and because all records from Dr. Snoderly's\r\n  June 3, 2003 evaluation, in which she mentioned psychological effects from the\r\n  physical injury, were excluded from evidence, the doctrine of res judicata does\r\n  not prevent this issue from being litigated.Â  See id. (&quot;The\r\n  doctrine of res judicata only acts to preclude relitigation of issues actually\r\n  litigated or which might have been litigated in the first action.&quot;).Â \r\n  Consequently, the change of condition hearing was the first opportunity a\r\n  single commissioner could consider Claimant's psychological condition, and it\r\n  was error for the single commissioner and the Appellate Panel to not consider\r\n  the issue.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  we find the circuit court was correct to rule the issue of depression could\r\n  have been raised and considered at the change of condition hearing, we find the\r\n  circuit court exceeded its scope of authority by finding Claimant had proven\r\n  entitlement to psychological benefits.Â  Both the single commissioner and the Appellate\r\n  Panel found they could not consider the issue of depression at the change of\r\n  condition hearing, and therefore, no factual findings were made concerning\r\n  whether Claimant carried her burden of proving her psychological condition had\r\n  worsened since the initial hearing.Â  In workers' compensation cases, this\r\n  Court, as well as the circuit court, serves only to review the factual findings\r\n  of the Appellate Panel and to determine whether the substantial evidence of\r\n  record supports those findings.Â  See Brown, 366 S.C. at 392, 622\r\n  S.E.2d at 553 (&quot;Pursuant to the APA, this Court's review is limited to\r\n  deciding whether the Appellate Panel's decision is unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence or is controlled by some error of law.&quot;).Â  Where the Appellate Panel\r\n  has made no factual findings, the issue must be remanded.Â  See Estridge,\r\n  325 S.C. at 540, 482 S.E.2d at 581 (finding the issue of change of\r\n  psychological condition should be remanded for the workers' compensation\r\n  commission to determine rather than have this Court make that determination).Â \r\n  We therefore reverse the circuit court's holding that Claimant has proven her\r\n  entitlement to psychological benefits and remand the issue to the\r\n  Commission.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  AND KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4551","title":"Jones v.

Harold Jones (Jones)\r\n  by adverse possession, and (2) Jones' claim of ownership was barred under the\r\n  doctrine of laches.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  October 10, 1966, C. W. Metts (Metts) conveyed the real property known as Lot\r\n  31 on the Metts Lake Subdivision Plat (Lot 31 or the Lot), along with other\r\n  property, to Jones for the sum of five dollars.Â  This conveyance was recorded\r\n  on October 17, 1966, in the Office of the Lexington County Register of Deeds.Â  From\r\n  the time Jones purchased Lot 31 until 1987, the Lot remained unimproved,\r\n  uncultivated, and unmarked.Â  \r\nOn October\r\n  21, 1987, the Owens purchased Lot 31 for $2,000 from Alice P. Shoaf (Shoaf).Â \r\n  In the deed, Shoaf stated when Metts conveyed Lot 32 to her by an earlier deed,\r\n  he did so inadvertently and Metts actually intended to convey Lot 31 to Shoaf.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Owens claim after purchasing Lot 31 from Shoaf in 1987, they performed several\r\n  &quot;acts of ownership&quot; on the Lot.Â  These purported acts included (1)\r\n  having the Lot surveyed in 1987; (2) seasonal bush-hogging and brush burning on\r\n  the Lot beginning in 1987; (3) putting down a driveway from the road leading\r\n  onto the Lot in 1987; (4) installing four white-tipped corner posts, each four\r\n  feet above the ground at the four corners of the Lot in 1987; (5) placing a\r\n  mesh wire fence with a gate along the back side of the Lot in 1987; (6)\r\n  installing &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs on the Lot between 1988 and 1989;\r\n  (7) using the Lot to store business supplies, such as cement blocks, a tractor\r\n  trailer, and fallen timber cut from the Lot starting in 1987; (8) installing a\r\n  mobile home, septic tank, and a well in 1998 and privacy fence in 2000; and (9)\r\n  paying property taxes on the Lot from 1987 to present.Â  As further evidence of\r\n  ownership, the Owens assert outside companies twice asked their permission to\r\n  access Lot 31.Â  The first time was in the 1990s when they were contacted by\r\n  Corley Brothers Lumber Company (Corley) requesting permission to cut trees on\r\n  Lot 31.Â  The second instance was in 2000 when South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas\r\n  (SCE&amp;G) contacted the Owens requesting permission for an easement to\r\n  install a power pole on Lot 31.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1998, the Owens' daughter, Mandy Leagan, and son-in-law, Jeff Leagan, (collectively\r\n  the Leagans) moved onto Lot 31 as their residence.Â  In 1998, the Owens conveyed\r\n  Lot 31 to the Leagans, and eventually in 2004, the Leagans reconveyed Lot 31\r\n  back to the Owens for the purpose of securing a loan.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2004, after seeing for the first time that &quot;something [was] going on with\r\n  [Lot 31],&quot; Jones met with an attorney.Â  On May 6, 2005, Jones filed an\r\n  action in ejectment and trespass to try title and sought to quiet title to Lot\r\n  31.Â  In response, the Owens sought title to Lot 31 by adverse possession under\r\n  color of title and also raised the equitable defense of laches.Â  \r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before the Special Referee on August 23, 2007.Â  The Owens\r\n  testified as to all of the acts described above.Â  The Owens also presented\r\n  copies of the deed from Shoaf as well as tax receipts for Lot 31 However,\r\n  several of the Owens' purported acts of ownership were not corroborated by any\r\n  witnesses or documentary evidence.Â  For instance, the Owens claim to have had\r\n  Lot 31 surveyed, but they presented no plat.Â  Also, the Owens presented neither\r\n  pictures of nor receipts for the corner posts, the fences, or the &quot;No\r\n  Trespassing&quot; signs.Â  Furthermore, the Owens presented no witnesses from\r\n  either SCE&amp;G or Corley to testify as to what research, if any, they\r\n  conducted before concluding the Owens were the legal owners of Lot 31.Â  \r\nJones\r\n  testified several times he had never once been to Lot 31 within the period from\r\n  1987 to 2004.Â  Contrary to this, Jones also testified he had been to the Lot\r\n  twice during that time, once in 1992 to level a road adjacent to Lot 31, and\r\n  again in 1997 with Lexington County officials.Â Â  Jones testified he did not see\r\n  any change in Lot 31 on either of these occasions.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  an order dated November 30, 2007 (the Order), the Special Referee found the\r\n  Owens to be the owners of Lot 31 by adverse possession and denied Jones'\r\n  request for ejectment and his action for trespass to try title and barred his\r\n  claim of ownership under the equitable doctrine of laches.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Jones filed an action in ejectment, trespass to try title and sought\r\n  to quiet title to Lot 31.Â  Normally, an action to quiet title to property is an\r\n  action in equity.Â  Clark v. Hargrave, 323 S.C. 84, 86, 473 S.E.2d 474,\r\n  476 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, the character, as legal or equitable, of an\r\n  action is determined by the complaint in its main purpose, the nature of the\r\n  issues as raised by the pleadings or the pleadings and proof, and the character\r\n  of the relief sought under them.Â  Id.Â Â  In their answer to Jones'\r\n  complaint, the Owens sought title to Lot 31 by adverse possession.Â  The\r\n  determination of title to real property is legal in nature.Â  Id. at 87,\r\n  473 S.E.2d at 476.Â  Moreover, an adverse possession claim is an action at law.Â  Id.Â  Thus, an action to quiet title to real property, primarily\r\n  involving the determination of title to real property based on adverse\r\n  possession, should be characterized as an action at law.Â  Id.Â  Because\r\n  an adverse possession claim is an action at law, the character of the\r\n  possession is a question for the jury or fact finder.Â  Miller v. Leaird,\r\n  307 S.C. 56, 61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1992).Â  Therefore, appellate review is\r\n  limited to a determination of whether any evidence reasonably tends to support\r\n  the trier of factâ€™s findings.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Clear and Convincing\r\n  Evidence of Adverse Possession\r\nJones\r\n  argues the Special Referee erred in concluding the Owens proved by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that they had acquired title to Lot 31 by adverse\r\n  possession.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen\r\n  it is asserted by the defendant, adverse possession is an affirmative defense. Â Miller\r\n    v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56, 62, 413 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1992).Â  The party\r\n  asserting adverse possession must show continuous, hostile, open, actual,\r\n  notorious, and exclusive possession for a certain period of time.Â  Mullis v.\r\n    Winchester, 237 S.C. 487, 491, 118 S.E.2d 61, 63 (1961).Â  In South\r\n  Carolina, adverse possession may be established if the elements of the claim\r\n  are shown to exist for at least ten years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-210 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  To meet this burden of proof, the party asserting the claim must show\r\n  by &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence he has met the requirements for\r\n  adverse possession.Â  Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 180, 345 S.E.2d\r\n  724, 726 (1986).\r\nJones\r\n  first argues the Special Referee applied the wrong test when he found the Owens\r\n  had established actual possession of Lot 31 by &quot;ample evidence.&quot;Â \r\n  Jones asserts the use of this phrase shows the Special Referee failed to apply\r\n  a clear and convincing standard and instead applied a lower burden of proof.Â  We\r\n  disagree for two reasons.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  the Special Referee recited the correct &quot;clear and convincing&quot;\r\n  standard in the opening of the &quot;Conclusions of Law&quot; section in the\r\n  part of the Order discussing the principles of adverse possession.Â  The use of\r\n  the word &quot;ample&quot; was merely part of a statement concluding the\r\n  portion of the Order pertaining to the actual possession requirement.Â  Second,\r\n  when the Special Referee found &quot;ample evidence,&quot; we believe the word\r\n  &quot;ample&quot; was merely an adjective to describe the evidence provided by\r\n  the Owens that sufficiently met the clear and convincing evidentiary standard.Â  See, e.g., State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 110, 504 S.E.2d 324, 329\r\n  (1998) (&quot;A review of the record reveals there is ample evidence to uphold\r\n  the trial court's ruling that the prior bad acts were proven by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.&quot;); Berry v. Ianuario, 286 S.C. 522, 525, 335\r\n  S.E.2d 250, 251 (Ct. App. 1985) (&quot;We find sufficient evidence in the\r\n  record . . . to meet the 'clear and convincing' evidence standard.&quot;).Â  We\r\n  believe the Order, when read in its entirety, makes clear the Special Referee\r\n  applied the correct clear and convincing standard to the adverse possession\r\n  claim.\r\nJones\r\n  next argues even if the Special Referee did apply the correct burden of proof,\r\n  he nevertheless erred in concluding the evidence presented by the Owens was\r\n  clear and convincing as to the elements of adverse possession.Â  However, given\r\n  that ours is an &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of review, we disagree.Â  \r\nAcquiring\r\n  title by adverse possession requires proof of actual, open, notorious, hostile,\r\n  continuous, and exclusive possession by the claimant, or by one or more persons\r\n  through whom he claimed, for the full statutory period.Â  Miller, 307\r\n  S.C. at 61, 413 S.E.2d at 844.Â  As discussed below, we believe the Owens\r\n  presented evidence establishing each of these requirements.\r\nA. Actual Possession\r\nActs\r\n  of ownership of open land need only be exercised in a way consistent with the possible\r\n  uses of the land and as the situation of the property permits, without actual\r\n  residency or occupancy.Â  Butler v. Lindsey, 293 S.C. 466, 471, 361\r\n  S.E.2d 621, 623 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  For the purpose of constituting adverse\r\n  possession by a person claiming title founded upon a written instrument, land\r\n  shall be deemed to have been possessed and occupied when it has been\r\n  &quot;usually cultivated or improved,&quot; and when it has been\r\n  &quot;protected by substantial enclosure.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-230 (Supp.\r\n  2008).\r\nThe\r\n  Owens purchased Lot 31 from Shoaf in 1987 for $2,000, and the deed was recorded\r\n  at the Lexington County Register of Deeds on the date of the closing.Â  At\r\n  trial, the Owens testified that between 1987 and 1998, they posted landscape\r\n  stakes at the corners of the Lot, bush-hogged and landscaped the Lot, graded a\r\n  driveway leading onto the lot, placed &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs\r\n  throughout the Lot, raised a mesh wire fence along the back of the Lot, stored business\r\n  supplies on the Lot, paid taxes on the Lot, and cut down timber on the Lot.Â  Between\r\n  1998 and 2000, a septic tank, a well, and wood privacy fences were installed on\r\n  the Lot.Â  On the basis of this evidence, the Special Referee held the Owens\r\n  acquired Lot 31 by adverse possession under color of title.Â  \r\nJones\r\n  argues the &quot;first clear act of ownership,&quot; if any, exercised by the\r\n  Owens was the installation of the mobile home, well, and septic tank in 1998.Â \r\n  Thus, the Owens' period of actual possession had not reached ten years by the\r\n  time this action was filed in 2005.Â  As for the Owens' activities prior to\r\n  1998, Jones argues the Owens' evidence of these activities did not rise to the\r\n  level of clear and convincing because their testimony regarding these acts was\r\n  contradictory and self-serving and was neither supported by documentary\r\n  evidence nor corroborated by any witnesses.\r\nThe\r\n  Special Referee, as trier of fact, has the task of assessing the credibility,\r\n  persuasiveness, and weight of the evidence presented.Â  Evatt v. Campbell,\r\n  234 S.C. 1, 6, 106 S.E.2d 447, 451 (1959).Â  In an action at law, this Court\r\n  must affirm the factual findings of the Special Referee unless no evidence\r\n  reasonably supports those findings.Â  Clark, 323 S.C. at 87, 473 S.E.2d\r\n  at 476.Â  Sworn testimony, albeit self-serving, is still evidence.Â  Id. at 90, 473 S.E.2d at 478 (affirming the master's holding that the lot in\r\n  question had been adversely possessed based, in part, on the testimony of the\r\n  adverse possessor).Â  In reviewing an action tried at law, it is not the place\r\n  of this Court to substitute its own view as to the facts.Â  United Farm\r\n    Agency v. Malanuk, 284 S.C. 382, 385, 325 S.E.2d 544, 546 (1985).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the Special Referee found the Owens' testimony credible.Â  Although the Owens'\r\n  testimony could have been bolstered by corroborating documentary evidence, the\r\n  Special Referee was convinced of the Owens' claim despite its absence.Â  To the\r\n  extent the Owens' testimony was contradictory[1] and self-serving, Jones' own testimony was also self-serving and, at times,\r\n  inconsistent.[2]Â \r\n  The Special Referee, as trier of fact, assessed the credibility of the evidence\r\n  presented by both parties, and we believe his findings are supported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Open and Notorious\r\nJones\r\n  argues the Special Referee erred in concluding the period of the Owens' adverse\r\n  possession was of sufficient length because prior to 1998, the Owens' activity\r\n  on Lot 31 did not rise to the level of open and notorious.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  the legal owner need not have actual knowledge the claimant is claiming\r\n  property adversely, the hostile possession should be so notorious that the\r\n  legal owner by ordinary diligence should have known of it.Â  Graniteville Co.\r\n    v. Williams, 209 S.C. 112, 120-21, 39 S.E.2d 202, 206 (1946).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the Owens performed several acts prior to 1998 that, had Jones\r\n  exercised ordinary diligence, would have put Jones on notice his land was being\r\n  possessed by another.Â  Starting in 1987, the Lot was bush-hogged regularly, a\r\n  driveway and wire fence were installed, timber was cut down, &quot;No\r\n  Trespassing&quot; signs and property stakes were installed, and business\r\n  supplies such as concrete blocks, timber, and a trailer were stored on the Lot.Â \r\n  All of these acts presumably resulted in physical changes to the Lot that would\r\n  be visible to a landowner exercising ordinary diligence in the ownership of his\r\n  property.Â  \r\nJones\r\n  presents three arguments as to why the Owens' activities were not sufficiently\r\n  open and notorious.Â  We believe all three are without merit.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  Jones argues the Owens' activities on Lot 31 prior to 1998 were insufficiently\r\n  open and notorious because they were &quot;temporary and transient.&quot;Â  In\r\n  support of this, Jones cites Getsinger v. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit\r\n    Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 430, 489 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 1997), for\r\n  the proposition &quot;[o]ccasional and temporary use or occupation does not\r\n  constitute adverse possession,&quot; and notes the Owens testified the timber,\r\n  cement blocks, and trailer were kept on the Lot merely for storage and that these\r\n  items were never stored on the Lot for very long.Â  However, this\r\n  argument seems to be directed more towards the continuousness requirement,\r\n  rather than the open and notorious requirement.Â  We will, therefore, address\r\n  this argument in the next section.\r\nNext,\r\n  Jones argues the Owens' activities were not open and notorious because no one\r\n  lived on Lot 31 and there were no permanent structures on the Lot from 1987\r\n  until 1998.Â  However, acts of ownership of open land for purposes of adverse\r\n  possession need not include actual residency or occupancy.Â  Butler, 293\r\n  S.C. at 471, 361 S.E.2d at 623.Â  Moreover, activities that do not involve the\r\n  creation of permanent structures on the land can be sufficiently open and\r\n  notorious as to put the legal owner on notice that his land is being adversely\r\n  possessed.Â  See, e.g., Miller, 307 S.C. at 62, 413 S.E.2d at 844\r\n  (holding evidence supported Special Referee's finding of adverse possession\r\n  when respondent paid the mortgages on the property, paid taxes on the property,\r\n  and marked the boundary lines of the disputed property, and cut and sold timber\r\n  on the tract in question for the statutory period).\r\nFinally,\r\n  Jones argues the Owens' activities were not open and notorious because (1) Mrs.\r\n  Owens testified an observer standing on the Owens' lot across the street from\r\n  Lot 31 could not have seen the mesh fence in the back of Lot 31, and (2) Mr.\r\n  Owens testified it was possible an observer might not have been able to see the\r\n  &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst,\r\n  the determination of whether possession is open and notorious is made from the\r\n  viewpoint of the legal owner exercising ordinary diligence, not of the adverse\r\n  possessor.Â  Graniteville Co., 209 S.C. at 120-21, 39 S.E.2d at 206.Â \r\n  Jones asks this Court to determine the open and notorious nature of the Owens'\r\n  possession from the viewpoint of the Owens by using Mrs. Owens' testimony as\r\n  evidence the possession was not open and notorious.Â  Essentially, Jones asks\r\n  this Court to assume the exercise of ordinary diligence would not require him\r\n  to view Lot 31 from any closer than the Owens' house across the street.Â  We do\r\n  not believe ordinary diligence is so limited.Â  Second, even assuming, arguendo,\r\n  both of the Owens' statements above are true, the other acts of ownership (e.g.,\r\n  the bush-hogging, brush burning, and the installation of the driveway) would\r\n  still suffice to put Jones on notice of the Owens' possession had he exercised\r\n  due diligence.\r\nC.&nbsp; Continuous \r\nJones\r\n  first contends the Owens' possession of Lot 31 was not continuous because the\r\n  Leagans' ownership of and residence on Lot 31 from 1998 to 2004\r\n  &quot;interrupted&quot; the Owens period of adverse possession.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  person claiming adverse possession must have personally held the property for\r\n  ten years, and tacking is allowed only between ancestor and heir.Â  Getsinger,\r\n  327 S.C. at 430-31, 489 S.E.2d at 225.Â  During the ten year period, tacking is\r\n  not allowed between successive occupants.Â  Id.Â  If the claimant's period\r\n  of adverse possession is interrupted, constructive possession is restored to\r\n  the owner.Â  Mullis, 237 S.C. at 496, 118 S.E.2d at 65.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Jones argues the Special Referee erred in holding the Leagans were\r\n  the Owens' &quot;heirs&quot; and their period of residence could, therefore, be\r\n  tacked onto the Owens' period of adverse possession.Â  On this point, we agree\r\n  with Jones because the Leagans are not the Owens' &quot;heirs.&quot;Â  See Alley v. Strickland, 279 S.C. 126, 127, 302 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1983) (&quot;Heirs\r\n  are not determined until the death of the ancestor in question.&quot;).Â \r\n  However, the Special Referee's error is irrelevant in light of the fact that\r\n  the Owens' possession of Lot 31 began in 1987 and continued until at least\r\n  1997, at which time they acquired title by adverse possession under the ten\r\n  year statute of limitations.Â  It was not until 1998 that the Owens deeded Lot\r\n  31 to the Leagans.Â  Thus, the Leagan's residence and ownership could not have\r\n  interrupted the Owens period of adverse possession.Â  \r\nJones\r\n  also argues the Owens' possession was &quot;temporary and transient,&quot;\r\n  rather than &quot;continuous,&quot; because the Owens testified the timber,\r\n  cement blocks, and trailer were kept on the Lot merely for storage and these\r\n  items were never stored on the Lot for very long.Â  We disagree.\r\nOccasional\r\n  and temporary use or occupation does not constitute adverse possession.Â  Getsinger,\r\n  327 S.C. at 430, 489 S.E.2d at 226.Â  However, the rule requiring continuity of\r\n  possession does not mean the person in possession must be actually on the land\r\n  during the whole of the statutory period.Â  Mullis, 237 S.C. at 495, 118\r\n  S.E.2d at 65.Â  &quot;Actual possession, once taken, will continue, though the\r\n  party taking such possession should not continue to rest with his foot upon the\r\n  soil, until he be disseised, or until he [does] some act which amounts to a\r\n  voluntary abandonment of the possession.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In determining\r\n  whether continuity of possession is broken, the nature and location of the land\r\n  should be considered and whether the use to which the land has been put\r\n  comports with the usual management of such property.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the fact the trailer and building supplies were not stored on Lot 31\r\n  for very long does not mean the Owens' possession was &quot;occasional and\r\n  temporary.&quot;Â  Mr. Owens is in the landscaping business and he used Lot 31\r\n  as storage for his supplies.Â  In the course of running a landscaping business,\r\n  presumably the trailer is brought along to job sites along with building\r\n  supplies.Â  It is, therefore, understandable his trailer would occasionally be\r\n  absent from the lot.Â  The same holds true for his building supplies such as\r\n  timber, bricks, and cement blocks.Â  As supplies get used, new ones come in,\r\n  such that no one set of blocks, bricks, or timber would remain on the Lot for\r\n  long.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the fact that the presence of the trailer and building supplies may not have\r\n  been continuous does not undo the fact the other acts of ownership were.Â  The\r\n  Owens testified they seasonally bush-hogged the Lot, burned brush on the Lot,\r\n  put up a mesh wire fence, and installed &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs.Â \r\n  Taken together, we believe the evidence presented supports the Special\r\n  Referee's finding of continuous possession.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we believe the Owens have met the requirement of continuous possession of Lot\r\n  31.\r\nD.&nbsp; Exclusive and Hostile\r\nJones\r\n  does not dispute the Special Referee's findings as to these two elements of\r\n  adverse possession.Â  An issue that is not argued in the brief is deemed\r\n  abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal.Â  Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR; Jinks\r\n    v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 344 n.3, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 n.3 (2003).Â \r\n  Accordingly, any argument regarding exclusivity or hostility is abandoned.\r\nII.&nbsp; Burden of Proof\r\nJones\r\n  argues the Special Referee impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him\r\n  &quot;by promulgating a series of acts a landowner must seemingly perform to\r\n  give notice to the world of ownership.&quot;Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  an action to quiet title, the burden of proof is on the party asserting adverse\r\n  possession as an affirmative defense. Clark, 323 S.C. at 87, 473 S.E.2d\r\n  at 476.Â  The Special Referee recited this principle of law at the outset of the\r\n  &quot;Conclusions of Law&quot; section of the Order.Â  Nevertheless, Jones\r\n  argues the Special Referee placed the burden of proof on him to establish\r\n  ownership by some set of affirmative acts.Â  In support of this, Jones points to\r\n  certain findings of fact by the Special Referee as evidence the Special Referee\r\n  implicitly required more of Jones than is normally required in a quiet title\r\n  action.Â  For instance, the Special Referee noted Jones had left Lot 31\r\n  &quot;unimproved, uncultivated[,] and unmarked&quot; and &quot;untouched as an\r\n  investment.&quot; He further noted Jones &quot;neglected to perform any act\r\n  whatsoever to give notice to the world that he was the owner of Lot 31.&quot;Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe these findings of fact speak only to what Jones did and did not do with\r\n  Lot 31, not what he should have done or what he was required to do under the\r\n  law.Â  While evidence of affirmative acts of ownership by Jones might have made\r\n  it more difficult for the Owens to meet their burden, nothing in the Order\r\n  suggests the Special Referee required Jones to produce evidence of such acts to\r\n  succeed in his quiet title action.Â  We also believe these findings of fact are\r\n  relevant to the defenses raised by the Owens.Â  The fact Jones had not made any\r\n  use of Lot 31 was relevant to the question of whether the Owens' use of Lot 31\r\n  was exclusive for purposes of adverse possession.Â  See Butler,\r\n  293 S.C. at 472, 361 S.E.2d at 624 (&quot;The exclusive possession necessary to\r\n  acquire title by adverse possession is not satisfied if occupancy is shared\r\n  with the owner or with agents of the owner.&quot;).Â  Also, the fact that Jones\r\n  had not visited Lot 31 for seventeen years was relevant to the question of\r\n  Jones' due diligence on both the laches defense, as discussed below, and the\r\n  open and notorious requirement of adverse possession.Â  See Jefferson\r\n    Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Gum, 302 S.C. 8, 11, 393 S.E.2d 180, 181 (1990)\r\n  (holding laches is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time,\r\n  under circumstances permitting diligence, to do what in law should have been\r\n  done); Graniteville Co., 209 S.C. at 120-21, 39 S.E.2d at 206 (holding\r\n  possession should be so notorious that the legal owner by ordinary diligence\r\n  should have known of it).Â  \r\nJones\r\n  also criticizes the Order to the extent it implies &quot;owning a piece of\r\n  property for purposes of leaving it undeveloped is not enough for a record\r\n  owner to maintain an interest in his property.&quot;Â  Certainly, owning\r\n  property as an investment with a duly recorded, valid instrument of title will\r\n  suffice for a landowner to be able to claim proper legal title and ownership in\r\n  many instances.Â  However, the mere fact a landowner holds valid record title\r\n  does not immunize the landowner from claims of adverse possession.Â  It is\r\n  possible such a landowner, despite his superior title, could nevertheless be\r\n  divested of his right to title if an adverse possessor successfully establishes\r\n  his claim.Â  See Clark, 323 S.C at 90-91, 473 S.E.2d at 478\r\n  (holding even though Clark held superior record title over adverse possessor to\r\n  the land in question, that fact alone could not divest one who properly\r\n  acquired title to the land by adverse possession); Sumner v. Murphy, 20\r\n  S.C.L. (2 Hill) 488 (1834) (finding a showing of adverse possession of land for\r\n  the time prescribed by the statute of limitations practically extinguishes the\r\n  right of the party having true paper title and vests a perfect title in the\r\n  adverse possessor).\r\nJones\r\n  also assigns error to the Special Referee's failure to make a finding as to which\r\n  party held legal title to Lot 31.Â  However, the Owens did not offer their\r\n  instrument of title for its superiority over Jones' deed.Â  Rather, their deed\r\n  was offered in support of their color of title claim.Â  &quot;A deed may be\r\n  color of title although the grantor was without interest or title in the land\r\n  conveyed.&quot;Â  Mullis, 237 S.C. at 495, 118 S.E.2d at 63.Â  Â Thus, the\r\n  validity of the Owens deed is irrelevant to an adverse possession claim.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the Special Referee did not need to determine which party held\r\n  superior record title on the basis of their competing instruments.Â  See id. (&quot;The extent of the occupant's claim founded on an instrument of writing\r\n  is not dependent upon the validity of such instrument.&quot;).\r\nWe,\r\n  therefore, find no error in the Special Referee's failure to determine which\r\n  party held legal title to Lot 31.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Laches\r\nJones\r\n  argues the Special Referee erred in applying the equitable doctrine of laches\r\n  to this case or, if laches is applicable, in misconstruing its application.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nCourts\r\n  have the inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary to ensure that\r\n  just results are reached to the fullest extent possible.Â  Ex Parte Dibble,\r\n  279 S.C 592, 595, 310 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct. App. 1983).Â  The equitable doctrine\r\n  of laches is defined as &quot;neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n  195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1998).Â  The party seeking to establish laches\r\n  must show (1) delay, (2) that was unreasonable under the circumstances, and (3)\r\n  prejudice. Â Kelley v. Kelley, 368 S.C. 602, 606, 629 S.E.2d 388, 391\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  To establish laches as a defense, the defendant must show the\r\n  complaining party unreasonably delayed its assertion of a right, thereby\r\n  prejudicing the defendant.Â  Id.Â  &quot;[T]he determination of whether\r\n  laches has been established is largely within the discretion of the trial\r\n  court.&quot; Â Id. at 607, 629 S.E.2d at 391.Â  Additionally, for the\r\n  defense of laches to be sustained, &quot;the circumstances must have been such\r\n  as to import that the complainant had abandoned or surrendered the claim or\r\n  right which he now asserts.&quot; Id. (quoting Byars v. Cherokee\r\n    County, 237 S.C. 548, 560, 118 S.E.2d 324, 330 (1961)).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Jones testified he did not visit Lot 31 for the seventeen years\r\n  between 1987 and 2004.Â  This delay was unreasonable under the circumstances\r\n  because Lot 31 is located in the same county where Jones is a resident.Â  Thus,\r\n  visiting Lot 31 should not have presented any great difficulty for Jones.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the Owens would be prejudiced if they were ejected from Lot 31\r\n  because they have invested a substantial amount of time and money into Lot 31,\r\n  whereas Jones has invested practically nothing. The Owens purchased Lot 31 in\r\n  good faith from Shoaf and had no knowledge of Jones' potential claim of\r\n  ownership.Â  Because Jones was in a better position to protect himself and avoid\r\n  the issue now facing the Court, we believe the equities favor the Owens.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find no error in the Special Referee's application of laches.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Admission of Hearsay\r\n  Evidence\r\nJones\r\n  argues the Special Referee erred by giving significant credibility and weight\r\n  to testimony by the Owens that they had numerous title searches performed\r\n  because Owens offered no documentation to support this.Â  However, Jones has\r\n  cited no legal authority to support the argument that this was an error of\r\n  law.Â  As such, this argument is conclusory, and such arguments are deemed\r\n  abandoned on appeal.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588,\r\n  600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding party abandoned an issue\r\n  on appeal due to failure to cite any supporting authority and making only\r\n  conclusory arguments).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the Special Referee's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Jones argues\r\n  the Owens' testimony was inconsistent because at one point, Mr. Owens testified\r\n  he had &quot;[no] serious doubts&quot; as to their ownership of Lot 31, but later\r\n  testified he acquired quitclaim deeds for &quot;further verification,&quot; as\r\n  sort of a &quot;second opinion.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] Jones testified\r\n  at times that he had not stepped onto Lot 31 for seventeen years from 1987 to\r\n  2004.Â  However, at other times, he claimed to have been to Lot 31 in 1992 and\r\n  1997. Â \r\n[3] In his brief,\r\n  Jones treats the open and notorious requirement of adverse possession as a\r\n  separate issue, under the sub-heading &quot;The Special Referee erred in his\r\n  calculation of the respondent's period of adverse claim and the determination\r\n  of time of appellant's first notice of such claim.&quot;Â  We address this under\r\n  the more general issue of whether the Special Referee erred in finding clear\r\n  and convincing evidence of each of the elements of adverse possession.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4552","title":"State v.

Finally Appellant argues the trial court erred in allowing the Victim to testify as to her out of court statements made to a friend's mother regarding her alleged attack, arguing the statements are hearsay and impermissible bolstering.","date":"2009-05-27","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tThe State, Respondent,\r\n\t\t\t\tv.\r\n\t\t\t\tAmaurys\r\n      Columbie Fonseca, Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From McCormick County\r\nR.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.:Â  Amaurys\r\n  Columbie Fonseca appeals his convictionfor the commission of a lewd act on a minor.Â  The original indictment\r\n  charged one count of a lewd act against a minor, but alleged two distinct\r\n  incidents:Â  one occurring in 2001 and another in 2003.Â  By order of the court,\r\n  the indictment was amended, and the State elected to proceed only on the 2003\r\n  lewd act.Â  Appellant alleges it was error to: (1) permit the State to proceed\r\n  under the amended indictment; (2) allow Victim to testify about the previous\r\n  2001 incident; and (3) admit a portion of Victim's testimony he asserts was\r\n  hearsay, and impermissible bolstering.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\r\n  remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  2007, Appellant was indicted on one count of committing a lewd act against a\r\n  minor.Â  The original indictment alleged that &quot;on or between August 1, 2001\r\n  and October 30, 2003, [Appellant] willfully and lewdly [did] commit a lewd\r\n  and/or lascivious act upon or with the body of&quot; Victim.Â  The indictment\r\n  alleged two separate offenses:Â  one in 2003, in which Appellant allegedly\r\n  pushed Victim down and proceeded to rub himself in a sexual manner against her;\r\n  and an earlier incident in 2001, in which Appellant allegedly lay beside Victim\r\n  in bed and touched her beneath her underwear, rubbing her vagina, as well as\r\n  exposing his penis to her.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  was married to Victim's older sister, and the assaults occurred when Victim was\r\n  visiting to help care for her sister's children.Â  It is alleged when Victim was\r\n  ten years old, in 2001, Victim was lying on a couch at her sister's home when\r\n  Appellant approached her and asked if she wanted to see his penis.Â  Despite\r\n  Victim declining, Appellant allegedly exposed his penis to her at which time\r\n  she retreated to a bedroom and pretended to be asleep. Â Appellant\r\n  followed Victim to the bedroom; laid beside her on the bed; touched her beneath\r\n  her underwear; and began &quot;feeling&quot; and &quot;groping&quot; her\r\n  genitals.Â  Victim did not immediately tell anyone of this incident.Â  \r\nVictim\r\n  continued to visit until 2003 without incident.Â  In 2003, when Victim was\r\n  twelve years old and visiting her sister's home, her sister asked her to\r\n  retrieve something from another room. Appellant followed Victim into the other\r\n  room, and when Victim bent over to pick up an item, Appellant pushed her down,\r\n  pulled her legs apart, and although fully clothed, put his genitals up against\r\n  hers in a manner simulating intercourse. Â After Victim threatened to\r\n  scream, Appellant ceased the assault. \r\nUpon\r\n  Appellant's motion, the trial court required the State to elect which\r\n  allegation it wished to pursue at trial.Â  The State indicated it wished to\r\n  pursue the 2003 allegation, and the indictment was modified. However, the trial\r\n  court permitted Victim to testify about the 2001 incident, allowing the testimony\r\n  as evidence of motive and intent.Â  The trial court found the 2001 incident did\r\n  not establish a common scheme or plan but it did serve to demonstrate\r\n  Appellant's intent in the 2003 sexual acts was for the purpose of gratifying\r\n  his lust, passion, or sexual desires.\r\nSometime\r\n  after the 2003 incident, Victim told a friend, and later the friend's mother\r\n  about the sexual assault.Â  During Victim's cross-examination, Appellant\r\n  elicited testimony that Victim had denied the incident when first confronted by\r\n  her friend's mother.Â  On redirect, the State sought to establish how much time\r\n  elapsed between Victim's initial denial and later disclosure of the assault.Â \r\n  Appellant objected on the basis of hearsay and impermissible bolstering.Â  The\r\n  trial court allowed the testimony based on counsel's cross-examination opening\r\n  the door and the closeness in time of the two events.Â Â  Additionally, the court\r\n  opined &quot;it [was] very very relevant.&quot; Â \r\nVictim's\r\n  sister testified at trial on behalf of Appellant as his only witness.Â  She\r\n  stated she never heard or saw anything occur between Appellant and Victim. \r\nThe\r\n  jury convicted Appellant of the commission of a lewd act on a minor.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  Thus, an\r\n  appellate court is bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are\r\n  clearly erroneous.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; INDICTMENT\r\nAppellant avers the\r\n  trial court erred in allowing the State to proceed under the amended\r\n  indictment.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Error Preservation\r\nInitially,\r\n  we address the State's contention that Appellant's issue is not preserved for\r\n  review.Â  We find the issue is preserved.\r\nThe\r\n  sufficiency of an indictment is not a matter of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction, and thus cannot be raised at anytime.Â  State v. Gentry,\r\n  363 S.C. 93, 101, 610 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2005) (&quot;[S]ubject matter\r\n  jurisdiction of the circuit court and the sufficiency of the indictment are two\r\n  distinct concepts.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â Â  An objection to the sufficiency\r\n  of an indictment must be made before the jury is sworn as provided by section\r\n  17-19-90 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  An objection to the sufficiency\r\n  of the indictment made after the jury is sworn is untimely. Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. at 101-02, 610 S.E.2d at 499.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Appellant first argued to the trial court the original indictment should be\r\n  severed.Â  The court agreed and instructed the State to elect which incident to\r\n  prosecute.Â  The indictment was amended once the State chose to proceed on the\r\n  2003 incident.Â  Accordingly, the next question was whether the 2001 incident\r\n  was admissible as a prior bad act.Â  The Court heard Victim's proffered\r\n  testimony and arguments from counsel, and ultimately admitted the 2001 incident\r\n  as evidence.Â  Immediately following the court's ruling, and prior to the jury\r\n  being sworn, Appellant objected:\r\n\r\n\tYour\r\n  Honor, for the record, the indictment has been considerably changed and excised\r\n  and so forth, and I understand the Court is putting in the August date.Â  So it\r\n  runs August 1 to October 30, I believe of 03, being the relevant dates for the\r\n  charged offense.\r\n\tWe\r\n  would submit this type of date change, although the other language was in\r\n  there, we would submit that the change to the indictment is such that from a\r\n  due process standpoint, we feel like this indictment has not been presented to\r\n  a grand jury, and we would object to the lack of presentment at this time.\r\n\r\nWe find this objection\r\n  properly preserves this issue for appeal. \r\nB.&nbsp; Sufficiency of\r\n  the Indictment\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the trial court erred in allowing the State to proceed under the amended\r\n  indictment, arguing it provided insufficient notice.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  indictment is a notice document.Â  Id. at 101, 610 S.E.2d at 499.Â Â \r\n  &quot;The primary purpose[] of an indictment [is] to put the defendant on\r\n  notice of what he is called upon to answer, i.e., to apprise him of the\r\n  elements of the offense and to allow him to decide whether to plead guilty or\r\n  stand trial, and to enable the circuit court to know what judgment to pronounce\r\n  if the defendant is convicted.&quot;Â  Evans v. State, 363 S.C. 495, 508,\r\n  611 S.E.2d 510, 517 (2005).Â  An indictment may be amended if:Â  (1) it does not\r\n  change the nature of the offense; (2) the amended charge is a lesser included\r\n  offense of the original crime charged in the indictment; or (3) the defendant\r\n  waives presentment to the grand jury and pleads guilty.Â  State v. Myers,\r\n  313 S.C. 391, 393, 438 S.E.2d 236, 237 (1993).\r\nHere,\r\n  the substance and nature of the crime charged was not affected by amending the\r\n  indictment.Â  Appellant conceded the language in the amended indictment was the\r\n  same as the original.Â  The only change made to the indictment concerned the\r\n  year of the alleged act.Â  Therefore, the amendment did not prejudice Appellant. State v. Horton, 209 S.C. 151, 155, 39 S.E.2d 222, 223-24 (1946)\r\n  (permitting the striking through of &quot;surplusage&quot; in an indictment\r\n  where the amendment worked no prejudice on the defendant).Â  Thus, we find the\r\n  amended indictment provided Appellant with sufficient notice.\r\nII.&nbsp; Prior Bad Act\r\nAppellant avers the trial court erred in allowing\r\n  evidence of his prior 2001 &quot;bad act&quot; under State v. Lyle, 125\r\n  S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), and Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  We agree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Motive and Intent\r\nGenerally, &quot;evidence of other distinct crimes\r\n  committed by the accused may not be adduced merely to raise an inference or to\r\n  corroborate the prosecution's theory of the defendant's guilt of the particular\r\n  crime charged.&quot;Â  Lyle, 125 S.C. at 415, 118 S.E. at 807.Â  However,\r\n  there are certain well-established exceptions to this general rule:\r\n\r\n\t[E]vidence of other crimes is competent to prove the\r\n  specific crime charged when it tends to establish, (1) motive; (2) intent; (3)\r\n  the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the\r\n  commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one\r\n  tends to establish the others; (5) the identity of the person charged with the\r\n  commission of the crime on trial.\r\n\r\nId.; Rule 404(b), SCRE (&quot;Evidence of other crimes,\r\n  wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to\r\n  show action in conformity therewith.Â  It may however, be admissible to show\r\n  motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of\r\n  mistake or accident, or intent.&quot;).\r\nHere, the trial court found the evidence of\r\n  Appellant's prior bad act admissible to show motive or intent under the Lyle exception and Rule 404.Â  Although Lyle does not distinguish between\r\n  sexual offenses and non-sexual offenses, the common trend in South Carolina is\r\n  to apply the Lyle exceptions differently to sexual offenses.Â  Compare Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (a forgery case), to State v. Nelson,\r\n  331 S.C. 1, 501 S.E.2d 716 (1998) (a child molestation case, distinguishing the\r\n  application of the Lyle exceptions for motive and intent from cases that\r\n  were not sexual in nature).\r\nThe exceptions of motive and intent are closely\r\n  related, especially in the prosecution of a sex crime.Â  Due to the unfortunate\r\n  frequency in which this issue arises, we take this opportunity to address the\r\n  applicability of the motive and intent exceptions of Lyle and Rule 404,\r\n  SCRE, in the context of sex crimes.\r\nIn Nelson, our supreme court noted there is\r\n  little doubt the motivation behind a sex crime is, at least in part, sexual\r\n  gratification.Â  Nelson, 331 S.C. at 10-11, 501 S.E.2d at 721.Â  In\r\n  finding evidence inadmissible to prove motive for the sexual offense, the Nelson court stated: \r\n\r\n\t[T]he motive for the alleged crimes involved in the\r\n  present case [is] apparent.Â  A person commits or attempts to commit [a sexual\r\n  offense] for the obvious motive of sexual gratification.Â  Since motive cannot\r\n  be deemed to have been a material issue at [defendant's] trial . . . testimony\r\n  [as to prior bad acts] was not admissible to prove [intent]. \r\n\r\nId. at 11, 501 S.E.2d at 721 (citing State v. Smith,\r\n  617 N.E.2d 1160, 1172 (Ohio Ct. App. 1992)) (internal citations omitted).[1]\r\nAs in Nelson, Appellant was accused of a sexual\r\n  offense (lewd act on a minor), and his motive was not made a material issue at\r\n  trial.Â  Therefore, we find the introduction of the prior bad act under the\r\n  motive exception provided in Lyle and Rule 404 was error.Â  \r\nSimilar reasoning is applicable to the exception of\r\n  intent.Â  See Nelson, 331 S.C. at 11, 501 S.E.2d at 721 (&quot;In\r\n  the trial of sex offenses, extrinsic evidence of intent is admissible only in\r\n  those cases where there is no challenge to the occurrence of the physical\r\n  contact itself, but the intent of the actor is at issue because the nature of\r\n  the contact is subject to varying interpretations&quot;) (quoting People v.\r\n    Bagarozy, 132 A.D.2d 225, 236, 522 N.Y.S.2d 848, 854 (N.Y. App. Div.\r\n  1987),Â  whereinÂ  the court found intent was not an issue when the appellant\r\n  denied any sexual contact).Â  \r\nThus, as in Nelson, because Appellant denies\r\n  that the contact ever occurred, intent was not made a material issue.Â \r\n  Furthermore, because intent is an element of most crimes, if we hold this\r\n  evidence admissible, prior sexual acts would be admissible to prove the\r\n  required intent in all prosecutions of subsequent sex crimes.Â  Such is a thin\r\n  disguise for impermissible character evidence and would undermine the\r\n  protections of Rule 404.Â  Without motive or intent being a material issue, it\r\n  is error to admit prior bad acts as evidence of the same in a sexual crime.Â \r\n  Thus, it was error to allow evidence of the 2001 incident as evidence of motive\r\n  or intent. \r\nB.&nbsp; Common Scheme or Plan \r\nThe State argues as an additional sustaining ground,\r\n  the 2001 incident should be permitted to show a common scheme or plan.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe State provides no compelling argument of any\r\n  similarities between the two occurrences,[2] or any argument to overcome the fact that the incidents are remote in time.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the State's argument is without merit.Â  See State v.\r\n    Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 546, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001) (finding\r\n  &quot;[a] close degree of similarity or connection between the prior bad act\r\n  and the crime for which the defendant is on trial is required to support\r\n  admissibility under the common scheme or plan exception&quot; and remoteness\r\n  between the two alleged acts is a factor to consider); State v. Kirton,\r\n  381 S.C. 7, 9, 671 S.E.2d 107, 117 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding a common scheme or\r\n  plan requires similarity between the prior act and the charged act that\r\n  increases the probative value of the evidence); State v. Aiken, 322 S.C.\r\n  177, 180, 470 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting the more similar the\r\n  prior act is to the charged act, the more likely the evidence will be\r\n  admissible); State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 S.E.2d 772, 774\r\n  (1984) (finding prior bad acts are admissible when close similarity between the\r\n  acts enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to outweigh the\r\n  prejudice); State v. Stokes, 279 S.C. 191, 193, 304 S.E.2d 814, 815\r\n  (1983) (holding to allow evidence as demonstrative of a common scheme or plan\r\n  requires more than merely the commission of two similar crimes); see also Kirton, 318 S.C. at 10, 671 S.E.2d at 117 (&quot;The common scheme or\r\n  plan exception 'is generally applied in cases involving sexual crimes, where\r\n  evidence of acts prior and subsequent to the act charged . . . is held\r\n  admissible as tending to show continued illicit intercourse between the same\r\n  parties.'&quot;) (citing State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 265, 89 S.E.2d\r\n  701, 711 (1955)).\r\nC.&nbsp; Harmless Error\r\nThe State also contends if it was error to allow the\r\n  testimony, any error was harmless.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo deem an error harmless, this court must determine\r\n  &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt the error complained of did not contribute to\r\n  the verdict obtained.&quot; Â Taylor v. State, 312 S.C. 179, 181, 439\r\n  S.E.2d 820, 821 (1993) (citing Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420\r\n  S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992)) (internal quotations omitted).Â  However, when\r\n  &quot;guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no\r\n  other rational conclusion can be reached,&quot; an insubstantial error not\r\n  affecting the verdict will be deemed harmless. Â State v. Pagan, 369 S.C.\r\n  201, 212, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006).Â  Due to the prejudicial tendency of\r\n  admitting the prior bad act testimony, we cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n  that the verdict was not affected by the evidence.Â  Accordingly, this error was\r\n  not harmless.\r\nD.&nbsp; Other Issues\r\nIn light of our decision that it was error to permit\r\n  the evidence of the 2001 prior bad act, we need not address Appellant's\r\n  remaining arguments on appeal. Â See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an\r\n  appellate court need not address remaining issues when a decision on a prior\r\n  issue is dispositive); Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One,\r\n  311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding the appellate court need\r\n  not address all issues when decision on a prior issue is dispositive). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is, AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN\r\n    PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Nelson distinguishes State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990), and State\r\n  v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991), where prior bad acts were\r\n  permitted to demonstrate motive in non-sexual cases.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; The\r\n  State avers that the fact that both of the incidents occurred in Appellant's\r\n  marital home while his wife was in the other room, demonstrates that the\r\n  Appellant had a common scheme or plan to attack the victim while his wife was\r\n  not present or was in the other room.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4553","title":"Barron v.

During the course of Appellant's\r\n  employment, a second location opened in the Charleston area, and Appellant was\r\n  told that she was being promoted to sales manager for both Charleston\r\n  locations.Â  In 2004, Appellant signed an employment agreement setting her\r\n  compensation in &quot;straight commission&quot; of 3% of customer payments\r\n  deposited and posted by both Charleston area offices each week within ninety\r\n  days of invoice date.Â  Neither party disputes Appellant's status as an at-will\r\nemployee.Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  second Charleston location opened for business in September 2004, and began\r\n  earning income that November.Â  By January 2005, Appellant believed Respondent\r\n  had not paid the full amount of commissions owed to her.Â Â  Appellant reported\r\n  her concerns of unpaid commissions and subsequently met with Ray on February 8,\r\n  2005, to discuss the matter.Â  Appellant alleges that at the time of the meeting\r\nshe was due at least $1,691.45 in unpaid commission. \r\nThe\r\n  following day, February 9, 2005, Respondent terminated Appellant's employment\r\n  citing the need to downsize in light of recent budget cuts.Â  Eight or nine days\r\nlater, Respondent paid Appellant all commissions owed to her.[1] \r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  August 2, 2005, Appellant filed suit alleging: (1) violation of SC Payment of\r\n  Wages Act; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of contract accompanied by a\r\nfraudulent act; and (4) wrongful discharge.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 13, 2006, Respondent moved for summary judgment before Judge Dennis,\r\n  asserting, inter alia, that it had paid all wages due Appellant.Â \r\n  It appears that initially this motion for summary judgment was denied; however,\r\n  the initial order supposedly entered on September 23, 2006, is not included in\r\n  the record on appeal.Â  Subsequently, Appellant's counsel agreed not to contest\r\n  summary judgment on any of the causes of action except the claim for wrongful\r\n  termination.Â  Accordingly, on February 26, 2007, Judge Dennis entered an\r\n  amended order, granting summary judgment on all claims except the wrongful\r\ntermination.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  wrongful termination claim then proceeded to trial, before Judge Pieper, where Respondent\r\n  made another motion for summary judgment.Â  Judge Pieper orally granted summary\r\n  judgment; however, before he entered a final order, Appellant filed a Rule 54(b)\r\n  motion, requesting that Judge Pieper amend Judge Dennis's February 26 summary\r\n  judgment order. Judge Pieper withheld ruling on any matters and instead\r\ninstructed Appellant to direct her Rule 54(b) motion to Judge Dennis.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Appellant filed an amended Rule 54(b) motion to change the February 26 order, requesting\r\n  that Judge Dennis: (1) state further facts to demonstrate Appellant did not\r\n  intend to prejudice the wrongful termination claim by consenting to summary\r\n  judgment on the related three causes of action; (2) deny summary judgment entirely;\r\n  or in the alternative (3) permit Appellant to voluntarily dismiss the three causes\r\n  of action.Â  On September 14, 2007, Judge Dennis denied Appellant's Rule 54(b)\r\nmotion. \r\nOn\r\n  January 11, 2008, Judge Dennis entered an order which granted Respondent's\r\nrenewed motion for summary judgment on the wrongful termination claim.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\nappeals the January 11 order, as well as the denial of the Rule 54(b) motion.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in granting\r\n    summary judgment to Labor Finders on the wrongful termination claim?\r\n  II. Did the trial court err in denying\r\n    Appellant's Rule 54(b) motion to revise the prior summary judgment?\r\n  III. In the alternative, even if the\r\n    Rule 54(b) motion should not have been granted, did the initial grant of summary\r\n    judgment work to bar Appellant's wrongful termination claim? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the circuit court.Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C.\r\n  242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006); Houck v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.\r\n    Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329&nbsp;(2005); Miller v.\r\n      Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 219, 616 S.E.2d 722, 729&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  The circuit court should grant summary judgment &quot;if the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.&quot; Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.,\r\n  353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334&nbsp;(2003); Knox v. Greenville Hosp.\r\n    Sys., 362 S.C. 566, 569-70, 608 S.E.2d 459, 461&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005); B\r\n      &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. O'Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 270, 603 S.E.2d 629,\r\n  631&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in\r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006); Vermeer\r\n      Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d\r\n301, 304&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that a wrongful termination claim is sustainable under the &quot;public\r\n  policy exception&quot; when an at-will employee is terminated subsequent to\r\ncomplaining of unpaid wages. We disagree.[2]\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina &quot;has long recognized the doctrine of employment at-will.&quot; Lawson\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 340 S.C. 346, 350, 532 S.E.2d 259, 260 (2000); Culler\r\n      v. Blue Ridge Elec. Coop., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 422 S.E.2d 91 (1992); Ludwick\r\n        v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985).Â  An employee\r\n  without a contract for a stated period of time is presumptively considered an\r\n  employee at-will, and employers may terminate such employees at anytime.Â  Cape\r\n    v. Greenville Sch. Dist., 365 S.C. 316, 319, 618 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2005) (noting\r\n  that even this presumption can be overcome and that occasionally an employment\r\ncontract for a definite period of time can be terminable at will).Â Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  our supreme court has adopted a public policy exception to the doctrine of\r\n  employment at-will, that &quot;[w]here [a] retaliatory discharge of an at-will\r\n  employee constitutes a violation of a clear mandate of public policy, a cause\r\n  of action in tort for wrongful discharge arises.&quot;Â  Lawson, 340 S.C.\r\n  at 350, 532 S.E.2d at 260 (citing Ludwick, 287 S.C. at 225, 337 S.E.2d\r\n  at 216) (internal quotations omitted).Â  This exception is generally applied in\r\n  a situation in which an employer requires an employee to violate a law, or when\r\nthe reason for the termination is itself a violation of criminal law. Id. \r\nAppellant\r\n  urges this Court to expand the public policy exception, relying on the supreme\r\n  court's 1995 decision in Garner v. Morrison Knudsen Corporation, 318\r\n  S.C. 223, 456 S.E.2d 907 (1995).Â  The Garner court stated that although\r\n  &quot;we have applied the public policy exception to situations where an\r\n  employer requires an employee to violate a law, and situations where the reason\r\n  for the employee's termination was itself a violation of criminal law, we have\r\n  never held the exception is limited to these situations.&quot;[3] Id. at 226, 456 S.E.2d at 909 (emphasis added and relied upon by\r\nAppellant).\r\nHowever,\r\n  more recently in Lawson, the supreme court cited Garner and held\r\n  that where the &quot;[a]ppellant was not asked to violate the law and his\r\n  termination did not violate criminal lawâ€¦[the] allegations [did] not support a\r\n  wrongful discharge action,&quot; suggesting that the exception has now been so\r\nlimited. Lawson, 340 S.C. at 261, 532 S.E.2d at 350.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we find Appellant's reliance on this Court's decisions in Keiger v. Citgo\r\n    Coastal Petroleum Inc., 326 S.C. 369, 482 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App. 1997) and Evans\r\n      v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 522 S.E.2d 350 (Ct. App. 1999) to\r\nbe misplaced. \r\nIn Keiger, an appeal from a grant of a 12(b)(6) motion, unlike the case at\r\n  hand, the appellant was fired for threatening to make a complaint to the\r\n  Employment Commission for a violation of the Payment of Wages Act. Keiger,\r\n  326 S.C. 369, 482 S.E.2d 792. Thus, Keiger holds that whether a\r\n  termination in retaliation for threatening to make a complaint will support a\r\nwrongful termination claim is not properly decided on a 12(b)(6) motion. Id. \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in Evans, an appeal from the denial of motions for judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial nisi remittitur, the record\r\n  demonstrated that the appellant was terminated in retaliation for actually\r\n  making a complaint to the Employment Commission. Evans, 337 S.C. 95, 522\r\n  S.E.2d 350. Accordingly, Evans stands for the proposition that when the\r\n  record demonstrates an employee was terminated for making an actual complaint\r\n  to the Employment Commission, a jury finding of wrongful termination will not\r\nbe set aside. Id.\r\nProcedurally,\r\n  the case at hand arises from a grant of summary judgment.Â  Thus, we do not find\r\n  either Keiger or Evans to be controlling in the case sub\r\n    judice. Cf. Â Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d\r\n  329, 334&nbsp;(2003) (finding the circuit court should grant summary judgment\r\n  &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\r\n  judgment as a matter of law&quot;); Law, 368 S.C. at 434-35, 629 S.E.2d at\r\n  648&nbsp;(2006) (stating the appellate court will reverse the circuit court's\r\n  ruling on a directed verdict or JNOV motion only when there is no evidence to\r\n  support the ruling or when the ruling is\r\n  controlled by an error of law); Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 116, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 869, 874&nbsp;(2006) (finding that in deciding whether the trial court\r\n  properly granted a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the appellate court must\r\n  consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief); and Proctor v. Dep't\r\n    of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 319-21, 628 S.E.2d 496,\r\n  518&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (ruling the grant or\r\n  denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge, and\r\n  his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\nof law). \r\nBecause\r\n  Appellant was not asked to violate the law and her termination itself was not a\r\n  violation of criminal law, summary judgment was proper; accordingly, the\r\n  wrongful termination claim could not be maintained.[4] Lawson, 340 S.C. at 350, 532 S.E.2d at 261 (finding that where the\r\n  appellant was not asked to violate the law nor was his termination itself a\r\n  violation of criminal law, a claim for wrongful termination could not be\r\nmaintained).Â  \r\nII. &amp; III.\r\nIn light of our decision supra neither the\r\n  denial of the Rule 54(b) motion, nor the initial grant of summary judgment\r\n  prejudiced Appellant's wrongful termination claim. Â We therefore do not address\r\n  Appellant's remaining issues on appeal. Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an\r\n  appellate court need not address remaining issues when a decision on a prior\r\n  issue is dispositive); Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One,\r\n  311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding the appellate court need\r\nnot address all issues when decision on a prior issue is dispositive). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\nthe ruling of the trial court is AFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It also appears Respondent\r\nincluded an additional amount for &quot;severance.&quot;\r\n[2] We note that the\r\n  Appellant alleges that termination by an employer who is in violation of the\r\n  South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, section 41-10-20 et. seq. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  (Supp. 2005), would fall within the ambit of the public policy exception; however,\r\n  the record does not support the position that Labor Finders was in fact in\r\n  violation of the Act.Â  The record demonstrates merely a cursory accusation of\r\nsuch a violation.\r\n[3] We point\r\n  out that procedurally the Garner decision was an appeal of a 12(b)(6)\r\n  SCRCP motion to dismiss.Â  Much of the discussion surrounded whether it was\r\n  proper to make a decision as to whether the conduct of the employer violated\r\npublic policy before any information had been developed for trial.Â  \r\n[4] &quot;Whether\r\n  the [Payment of Wages Act] itself, which was designed to protect working people\r\n  and assist them in collecting wrongfully withheld compensation, see Dumas\r\n    v. InfoSafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 463 S.E.2d 641 (Ct. App. 1995),\r\n  constitutes a legislative declaration of public policy has never been addressed\r\n  by the courts of this state.&quot;Â  Keiger, 326 S.C. at 373, 482 S.E.2d\r\n  at 794.Â  However, because there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate\r\n  that Labor Finders violated the Payment of Wages Act we do not find it\r\n  necessary at this time to decide whether the Act is such a legislative\r\ndeclaration.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
