Greeley, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Kevin S.\r\n  Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:Â  In this criminal matter, Berry Scott Bolin (Bolin) asserts the\r\n  trial court erred in (1) denying a requested jury charge on certain provisions\r\n  of the &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; contained in Section 16-11-440 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, and (2) denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn the night of February 18, 2006, Bolin and several other\r\n  individuals were guests in the home of Bradley Deal (Deal).Â  Travis Falls (Falls), Holly McCarter (McCarter), Bobby Hovis (Hovis), and two others decided to\r\n  drive to Deal's home to attack Deal, his brother, and various other people at\r\n  the home.Â  \r\nFalls, having been released on bond only a few days\r\n  earlier for charges of assault and battery on Deal, was under a bond provision\r\n  forbidding any contact with Deal or his home.Â  Despite the bond provision,\r\n  Falls and the others drove to Deal's home, pulling up on the roadside just past\r\n  the front of the driveway.Â  Upon Falls' arrival, people began to rush outside\r\n  of Deal's home, including Bolin.Â  Falls and the others exited the car and\r\n  proceeded up the driveway.Â  One of the men yelled to start a fight and threw a\r\n  beer bottle onto the driveway, shattering the bottle.Â  As this was occurring, a\r\n  fight ensued near the car between McCarter and Lori Moss (Moss), who was also a\r\n  guest at Deal's home.Â  Falls joined the fight and hit Moss, knocking her to the\r\n  ground.Â  \r\nAs Bolin exited the home, he heard someone yell to get\r\n  a gun. Â Bolin went to his truck parked in the yard in front of Deal's home and\r\n  retrieved a pistol stored in the glove compartment of the truck. Â Bolin heard\r\n  gunfire near the car and to his side.Â  Falls and several others ran to their\r\n  car and got inside.Â  As they entered the vehicle, Bolin heard more shots being\r\n  fired near the car.[1]Â \r\n  McCarter got in the driver's seat with Falls directly behind her while Hovis sat\r\n  in the rear passenger seat next to Falls.Â Â  \r\nAs the car began to pull away, Bolin and another\r\n  individual who was standing beside Bolin fired several shots at the vehicle. Â A\r\n  bullet of the same caliber as Bolin's pistol shattered the rear window, passed\r\n  through Falls' wrist and hit Hovis in the head.Â  The car proceeded away from\r\n  the scene and headed to the Clover Police Department.Â  An ambulance was\r\n  dispatched and Falls and Hovis were taken to the hospital.Â  Hovis was\r\n  pronounced dead at the hospital; Falls received treatment and was released. \r\nOn May 18, 2006, Bolin was indicted by the York County\r\n  Grand Jury on charges of murder, assault and battery with intent to kill,\r\n  discharging a weapon into an occupied vehicle, unlawful possession of a pistol,\r\n  and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent offense. Â The\r\n  case was tried before a jury on August 28, 2006.Â  Prior to trial, the court\r\n  quashed the indictment of unlawful possession of a pistol and the case\r\n  proceeded on the remaining indictments.Â  \r\nAt the close of the State's case, Bolin moved for a directed\r\n  verdict on all indictments asserting Section 16-11-440(C) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code. Â The motion was denied and the case proceeded.Â  Following closing\r\n  arguments, the court instructed the jury on the law of the case.Â  Although\r\n  requested by Bolin, the court refused to charge the jury on the presumptions\r\n  contained in Â§ 16-11-440(A) and (E). Â The jury returned a verdict finding Bolin\r\n  guilty of voluntary manslaughter, assault and battery of a high and aggravated\r\n  nature, and discharging a weapon into an occupied vehicle. Â Bolin received concurrent\r\n  sentences of thirty years. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBolin asserts the circuit court erred in refusing to instruct\r\n  the jury on the legal presumptions contained in Section 16-11-440 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), also referred to as the Protection of Persons and\r\n  Property Act (the Act).Â  Specifically, Bolin asserts that the Act, which\r\n  codified the common law Castle Doctrine and substantively expanded the law of\r\n  self defense in this State, should have been applied in the instant case.[2]Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to\r\n  ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  State v. Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. 527, 561, 647 S.E.2d 144, 161 (2007).Â  Thus, in interpreting statutes,\r\n  we look to the plain meaning of the statute and the intent of the legislature.Â  State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 32, 667 S.E.2d 728, 733 (2008).Â  A\r\n  statute's language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the\r\n  statute. Â Id. at 33, 667 S.E.2d at 733. Whenever possible, legislative\r\n  intent should be found in the plain language of the statute itself. Â Id. Â &quot;Where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a\r\n  clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\n  needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.&quot; Â Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 561, 647 S.E.2d at 161(citing Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79,\r\n  85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000)).\r\nWhere the legislative intent is not clear, we adhere\r\n  to the presumption that statutory enactments are to be given prospective rather\r\n  than retroactive application.Â  See State v. Varner, 310\r\n  S.C. 264, 266, 423 S.E.2d 133, 134 (1992).Â  The exception to the presumption of\r\n  prospective operation arises when the statute is remedial or procedural in\r\n  nature.Â  State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 334, 422 S.E.2d 133, 139 (1992),\r\n  overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 352 n.\r\n  2, 520 S.E.2d 614, 616 n. 2 (1999).Â  However, as indicated, legislative intent\r\n  is paramount in determining whether a statute will have prospective or\r\n  retroactive application.Â  Jenkins v. Meares, 302 S.C. 142, 146, 394\r\n  S.E.2d 317, 319 (1990).Â  \r\nTurning to the case at bar, the Act went into effect\r\n  on June 9, 2006, four months after the events leading to the instant matter.Â \r\n  Thus, in order for the Act to apply, the legislature must have either intended\r\n  the Act to be retroactive or, in the absence of such legislative intent, the\r\n  Act must fall under the exception to the presumption of prospective application\r\n  by being remedial or procedural.Â  Here, as indicated in this court's recent\r\n  holding in State v. Dickey, __ S.C. __, 669 S.E.2d 917 (Ct. App. 2008), there\r\n  is no evidence of legislative intent that the Act be applied retroactively. Â Id. at __, 669 S.E.2d at 928. Â In fact, the plain language of the Act specifically\r\n  indicates the legislature's intent that the Act be applied prospectively.Â  Id. Â Section 4 of the Act expressly provides: \r\n\r\n\tThe repeal or\r\n  amendment by this act of any law, whether temporary or permanent or civil or\r\n  criminal, does not affect pending actions, rights, duties, or liabilities\r\n  founded thereon, or alter, discharge, release or extinguish any penalty,\r\n  forfeiture, or liability incurred under the repealed or amended law, unless the\r\n  repealed or amended provision shall so expressly provide.Â  After the effective\r\n  date of this act, all laws repealed or amended by this act must be taken and\r\n  treated as remaining in full force and effect for the purpose of sustaining any\r\n  pending or vested right, civil action, special proceeding, criminal\r\n  prosecution, or appeal existing as of the effective date of this act, and for\r\n  the enforcement of rights, duties, penalties, forfeitures, and liabilities as\r\n  they stood under the repealed or amended laws.\r\n\r\n2006 S.C. Act No. 379 Â§ 4. Â By stating that the Act is to have no\r\n  effect on pending actions, criminal prosecutions, rights, duties, or\r\n  liabilities, and that all laws repealed or amended by the Act must be treated\r\n  as remaining in full force and effect, the clear language of the Act indicates\r\n  that it is prospective. Â Dickey, Â­__ at __, 669 S.E.2d at 928.Â  Thus, because\r\n  the legislature clearly and unambiguously specified the Act be applied\r\n  prospectively, the Act cannot be applied retroactively to Bolinâ€™s case.[3] Â See id. (holding retroactive application of the Act to prosecution that was\r\n  pending before the effective date of the Act was precluded because the Act is\r\n  prospective). Â Therefore, the trial court committed no error in refusing the\r\n  requested charge. \r\nBecause we find the Act does not retroactively apply to\r\n  Bolin's case, we need not address Bolin's remaining argument concerning the court's\r\n  refusal to direct a verdict based upon Â§ 16-11-450 of the Act.Â  Additionally,\r\n  counsel withdrew this ground of appeal at oral argument and proceeded only with\r\n  the jury charge issue. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the order of\r\n  the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At oral argument, Bolin's counsel acknowledged that the\r\n  record contained no evidence Bolin saw gunfire or gun smoke coming from the car;\r\n  the record only suggests Bolin heard gunfire.Â  \r\n[2] Bolin requested the jury to be charged on Â§\r\n  16-11-440(A) and (E) based on the assumption that pursuant to Â§ 16-11-440(E),\r\n  the aggressor intended to commit an unlawful act and that pursuant to Â§\r\n  16-11-440(A), Bolin was, therefore, acting within reasonable fear of imminent\r\n  peril of death or great bodily injury to himself or another. Â See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-440(A), (E) (Supp. 2008).\r\n[3] Given that the legislature clearly specified the Act\r\n  to apply prospectively, we need not determine whether the Act is remedial or\r\n  procedural in nature.Â  Notwithstanding, Dickey resolved this issue by\r\n  holding the Act is neither remedial nor procedural.Â  Dickey, __ at __,\r\n  669 S.E.2d at 928. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4499","title":"Proctor v.

Proctor (Father) appeals from the family court's order finding he willfully failed to support his child and\r\n  terminating his parental rights.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2003, Father and Teresa Spires (Mother) had a sexual\r\n  relationship.Â  The parties ended their sexual relationship but maintained\r\n  contact, and at some point, Mother told Father she was pregnant.Â  However,\r\n  Mother spoke to Father in January 2004 and denied being pregnant.Â  On May 14,\r\n  2004, Mother gave birth to a child (Child), and at that time, Mother claimed\r\n  she believed the Child belonged to a man other than Father.Â  After learning of the\r\n  Child's birth through a third party, Father repeatedly attempted to contact\r\n  Mother, but she refused to speak with him.Â  In December of 2004, Father left a\r\n  Christmas gift for the Child under the Christmas tree at Mother's church.Â  In\r\n  late 2004 or early 2005, Father went to\r\n  the church and saw the Child there with Mother's parents.Â  Upon seeing Father,\r\n  Mother's parents took the Child and left.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Mother married another man she was seeing around the same time as Father, believing\r\n  this man was the Child's father; however, a paternity test proved he was not the\r\n  Child's father.[1]Â  In December 2004, Mother\r\n  filed sexual assault charges against Father alleging the Child resulted from\r\n  Father forcibly raping Mother.Â  In May 2005, law enforcement contacted Father\r\n  concerning the sexual assault charges and the allegation of paternity.Â  Father did\r\n  not contact Mother about the Child because of the alleged sexual assault.[2]Â \r\n  On two separate occasions, Mother applied for child support from Father through\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Social Services; however, she terminated both\r\n  applications before paternity was established or an order for support was\r\n  entered.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  April 2006, Father filed suit seeking a determination of paternity and\r\n  visitation rights with the Child.Â  Father offered to pay child support if\r\n  Mother allowed him visitation with the Child.Â  Mother counter-claimed seeking\r\n  termination of Father's parental rights (TPR).Â  Following a temporary hearing\r\n  on July 17, 2006, the family court appointed a guardian ad litem, required both\r\n  parties to submit to drug testing, and held in abeyance the issues of child\r\n  support, visitation, and attorney's fees.Â  Mother tested negative for drugs,\r\n  but Father tested positive for cocaine.Â  The family court ordered Father to\r\n  submit to two additional drug tests, both of which came back negative.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  matter was tried on December 11, 2007.Â  The family court found Mother's\r\n  testimony that Father had sexually assaulted her was not credible.Â  The family\r\n  court terminated Father's parental rights, holding Father had willfully failed\r\n  to support the Child for more than six months and termination was in the Child's\r\n  best interest.Â  Father filed this expedited appeal.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Father argues the family court erred in finding he willfully failed to\r\n  support the Child.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  &quot;the grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence,&quot;\r\n  an appellate court may examine the entire record in a TPR case &quot;to\r\n  determine facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.&quot;Â  Stinecipher\r\n    v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 97, 620 S.E.2d 93, 96 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Despite\r\n  this broad scope of review, the appellate court should not necessarily\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court because it was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to assign weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Charleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C.\r\n  87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 2006). \r\nIn South Carolina, procedures for TPR are governed by statute. Â See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 63-7-2510 to -2620 (Supp. 2008). Â Statutory grounds for TPR\r\n  include the parent's willful failure to support the child, when:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n  and during that time the parent has wil[l]fully failed to support the child. Failure\r\n  to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to\r\n  the child's care. Â A material contribution consists of either financial\r\n  contributions according to the parent's means or contributions of food,\r\n  clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to\r\n  the parent's means. Â The court may consider all relevant circumstances in\r\n  determining whether or not the parent has wil[l]fully failed to support the\r\n  child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the\r\n  parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(4) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  a parent's failure to support a child is &quot;willful&quot; within the meaning\r\n  of the statute is a question of intent to be determined in each case from all\r\n  the facts and circumstances.Â  Conduct of the parent which evinces a settled\r\n  purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as &quot;willful&quot;\r\n  because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to\r\n  receive support and consortium from the parent. \r\n\r\nS.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.\r\n  v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627\r\n  S.E.2d 718, 721-22 (2006) (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  family court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence proved Father\r\n  willfully failed to support the Child.Â  The record is devoid of evidence Father's\r\n  non-payment of any child support prior to July 17, 2006, was willful.Â  Rather,\r\n  the evidence indicates Father's efforts to inquire into his possible\r\n  relationship with the Child were thwarted by Mother when she: (1) refused to\r\n  communicate with Father; (2) refused to admit the Child was Father's until he\r\n  filed this suit; (3) prevented Father from contacting her by accusing him of\r\n  criminal sexual conduct; and (4) withdrew both applications for child support\r\n  before paternity could be determined or a support order established.Â  Father\r\n  was not obligated to pay child support after July 17, 2006, because the family\r\n  court's order of that date held the issue of child support in abeyance.Â  In\r\n  addition, no prior support order existed.Â  The family court's order following\r\n  trial terminated Father's parental rights as well as his parental\r\n  responsibilities.Â  Consequently, the family court erred in finding Father\r\n  willfully failed to support the Child and in terminating Father's parental\r\n  rights.[3]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we reverse and remand this case to the family court to make a determination on\r\n  visitation, child support, attorney's fees, and guardian ad litem's fees. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Father has not taken a paternity test to prove he is\r\n  the Child's father.Â  \r\n[2]Â In its order, the family court found Father did not\r\n  willfully fail to visit the Child.Â  The court noted it found credible Father's &quot;testimony\r\n  that he was reluctant to contact [Mother] directly after he learned he was\r\n  being investigated for her allegation that he had sexually assaulted her.&quot;Â \r\n  The court also noted Father would have had to directly contact Mother to\r\n  arrange any visitation with the Child.Â  \r\n[3] Due to our disposition of Father's first issue, we\r\n  need not address the issue of whether TPR was in the Child's best interest.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal). \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4500","title":"Floyd v.

Contractors.Â  The parties\r\n  stipulated Claimant was permanently and totally disabled pursuant to section\r\n  42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), and he was awarded benefits for\r\n  the remainder of his life.Â  Claimant's remaining life expectancy was determined\r\n  to be 18.99 years meaning he was awarded benefits for 987.48 weeks.Â  The\r\n  parties also agreed by consent order Carrier would pay the sum of $57,500 in\r\n  attorney's fees to be deducted from the end of Claimant's award pursuant to Glover\r\n    by Cauthen v. Suitt Construction Co., 318 S.C. 465, 458 S.E.2d 535 (1995).Â \r\n  Claimant received 254 weeks of benefits but then died from an unrelated\r\n  aneurism in his abdomen.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  Claimant's death, Mrs. Floyd claimed she was entitled to the balance of 987.48\r\n  weeks compensation pursuant to section 42-9-280 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1985).Â  Section 42-9-280 provides the next of kin of a claimant who dies from\r\n  an unrelated injury may receive the balance of unpaid compensation if the award\r\n  was made pursuant to the second paragraph of section 42-9-10 or\r\n  section 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â  Also\r\n  relying upon section 42-9-280, Carrier stopped payment of Claimant's benefits\r\n  at the time of his death.Â  However, prior to the hearing before the single commissioner,\r\n  Carrier acceded Mrs. Floyd should receive the balance of five-hundred weeks' compensation.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found Mrs. Floyd was entitled\r\n  to the commuted value of the balance of Claimant's lifetime award minus a\r\n  credit for attorney's fees paid by Carrier.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the\r\n  payment of benefits, but limited the amount to the balance of five-hundred\r\n  weeks.Â  Claimant appealed.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel and\r\n  found Carrier was not allowed a credit for attorney's fees.Â  \r\nOn appeal to this\r\n  court, Mrs. Floyd contends she is entitled to the full balance of 987.48 weeks of\r\n  compensation.Â  Carrier cross-appeals claiming the circuit court erred in\r\n  failing to award it credit for attorney's fees as provided for in the consent\r\n  order between Claimant and Carrier.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\n  appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\n  reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Libery Mut. Ins.\r\n    Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  Statutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  Stewart v.\r\n    Richland Mem'l Hosp., 350 S.C. 589, 593, 567 S.E.2d 510, 512 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Compensation to Mrs. Floyd\r\nMrs.\r\n  Floyd argues she is entitled to the balance of compensation remaining on\r\n  Claimant's lifetime award.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) is composed of four paragraphs,\r\n  (A)-(D).Â  Paragraph (A) limits a claimant's award to a maximum of five-hundred\r\n  weeks even for total, permanent disability.Â  Paragraph (B) provides &quot;[t]he loss\r\n  of both hands, arms, shoulders, feet, legs, hips, or vision in both eyes, or\r\n  any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability to be compensated\r\n  according to the provisions of this section.&quot;Â  Consequently, an injury\r\n  listed in Paragraph (B) would entitle the claimant to the maximum allowable\r\n  award of five-hundred weeks.\r\nParagraph (C) provides the only exception to this limitation.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the five-hundred-week limitation prescribed in\r\n    this section or elsewhere in this title, any person determined to be totally\r\n    and permanently disabled who as a result of a compensable injury is a\r\n    paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical brain damage is not\r\n    subject to the five-hundred-week limitation and shall receive the benefits for\r\n    life.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nSection 42-9-280 of the South Carolina Code (1985) addresses\r\n  situations like the one in this case in which an injured claimant later dies\r\n  from a cause unrelated to the workplace injury.Â  \r\n\r\n  When an employee receives or is entitled to compensation under\r\n    this Title for an injury covered by the second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 or\r\n    42-9-30[[1]] and dies from any\r\n    other cause than the injury for which he was entitled to compensation, payment\r\n    of the unpaid balance of compensation shall be made to his next of kin\r\n    dependent upon him for support, in lieu of the compensation the employee would\r\n    have been entitled to had he lived. \r\n\r\nÂ§ 42-9-280.\r\nIn Stone v. Roadway Express, 367 S.C. 575, 627 S.E.2d 695\r\n  (2006), our supreme court addressed the interpretation of this statute and\r\n  elucidated the basis for the operation of these statutes together.Â  In Stone,\r\n  the claimant was found to be permanently and totally disabled pursuant\r\n  specifically to section 42-9-10(A).Â  367 S.C. at 583 n.1, 627 S.E.2d at 698\r\n  n.1.Â  Upon Stone's death from an unrelated cause, Stone's widow contended she\r\n  was entitled to the balance of her husband's benefits.Â  Id. at 578, 627\r\n  S.E.2d at 696.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n  The language of Â§ 42-9-280 is plain.Â  The legislature, as is its\r\n    prerogative, determined that dependent survivors should receive all benefits\r\n    due an injured worker who lost the use of a scheduled member (Â§ 42-9-30), or\r\n    &quot;lost both hands, arms, feet, legs, or vision in both eyes, or any two\r\n    thereof&quot; (second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10), i.e., those who suffered a\r\n    physical loss, while the dependents of a person totally disabled for another\r\n    reason, i.e., one who suffered a wage loss compensated under the first\r\n    paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10, should not.Â  The legislative distinction between\r\n    &quot;physical loss&quot; and &quot;wage loss&quot; appears in other workers'\r\n    compensation statutes as well.\r\n  Professor Larson notes that since a compensation award, unlike a\r\n    tort award, is a personal one based on the employeeâ€™s need for a substitute for\r\n    lost wages and earning capacity, in the absence of a special statutory\r\n    provision, heirs have no claim to unaccrued weekly payments. In construing a\r\n    workers' compensation statute, &quot;the words must be given their plain and\r\n    ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\n    expand the statute's operation.&quot; Â Section 42-9-280 specifically provides\r\n    for the inheritability of two types of awards\r\n    only. \r\n\r\nStone, 367 S.C. at 585-86, 627 S.E.2d at 700\r\n  (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn the present case, Claimant's injury was serious and\r\n  catastrophic.Â  However, his award was made pursuant to paragraph (C) of section\r\n  42-9-10.Â  Section 42-9-280 does not include awards made under paragraph (C)\r\n  among those that survive a claimant's death from an unrelated cause.\r\nSection 42-9-10(A), at issue in Stone, focuses on\r\n  situations in which a claimant's &quot;incapacity for work resulting\r\n  from an injury is total.&quot;Â  Likewise, paragraph (C) seems to focus on a\r\n  claimant's inability to earn a wage as opposed to a physical loss.Â  The statute\r\n  conditions the lifetime award of benefits upon a finding of total and permanent\r\n  disability.Â  See Â§ 42-9-10(C) (&quot;[A]ny person determined to be\r\n  totally and permanently disabled who as a result of a compensable injury is a\r\n  paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical brain damage . . .\r\n  shall receive benefits for life.&quot;).\r\nClaimants\r\n  suffering catastrophic injuries like Claimant's may require specialized\r\n  healthcare without the means to earn a wage.Â  The award of compensation for a\r\n  claimant's life expectancy seems to recognize this reality.Â  If so, it is also\r\n  logical benefits would terminate upon such a claimant's death from an unrelated\r\n  cause.\r\nCarrier does not appeal the circuit courtâ€™s award of the balance\r\n  of five-hundred weeks' compensation.Â  Therefore, that ruling is the law of the\r\n  case and is affirmed.Â  See First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden,\r\n  333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;The unchallenged\r\n  ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance.&quot;). \r\nII. Attorney's Fees\r\nCarrier\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in failing to credit attorney's fees to them\r\n  when a consent order to that effect was entered into by the parties.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nDeducting\r\n  fees paid by a carrier to a claimant's attorney from the end of a lifetime\r\n  award is proper under Glover by Cauthen v. Suitt Construction Co., 318\r\n  S.C. 465, 458 S.E.2d 535 (1995).Â  This was the\r\n  arrangement agreed to by the parties via consent order.Â  Mrs. Floyd argues\r\n  the consent order only applied if Claimant was receiving lifetime\r\n  compensation.Â  Therefore, she contends, when Carrier agreed only to payment of\r\n  the balance of five-hundred weeks' compensation, the consent order became\r\n  inapplicable.Â  This position is unpersuasive.Â  Â \r\nWe recognize Claimant's untimely passing and other circumstances\r\n  in this case changed his compensation from a lifetime award to one of a fixed\r\n  duration; however, we do not believe that negates the agreement by the parties\r\n  regarding the credit of attorney's fees.[2]Â  According to the record and statements at\r\n  oral argument, slightly more than 126 weeks of compensation is owed to Mrs.\r\n  Floyd.Â  Therefore, Carrier owes sufficient money to permit the credit without\r\n  requiring any reimbursement from Mrs. Floyd.[3]Â \r\n  Consequently, we find Carrier is entitled to a credit for attorney's fees paid\r\n  on behalf of Claimant. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the\r\n  precedent set forth in Stone and a plain reading of the relevant statutes, we find Mrs.\r\n  Floyd is not entitled to the balance of her husband's lifetime benefits.Â  Because\r\n  the award of the balance of five-hundred weeks' compensation is not appealed,\r\n  we affirm that finding as it is the law of the case. \r\nWith respect to attorney's fees, we reverse the circuit court because\r\n  the allowance of a credit for attorney's fees, pursuant to the agreement of the\r\n  parties and the circumstances of this case, is appropriate.Â  Therefore, the order\r\n  of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This section addresses injuries to scheduled members.\r\n[2] A claimant and a carrier may agree that the\r\n  claimant's attorney's fees, paid by the carrier, will be deducted from an award\r\n  of a fixed duration greater than one hundred weeks.Â  See id. at 469, 458 S.E.2d\r\n  at 538 (finding section 42-9-10 and 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-1207 (1982),\r\n  when read together, permit the lump sum award of attorney's fees).Â  \r\n[3] We are not called upon to consider whether repayment\r\n  of attorney's fees may be required when the credit for attorney's fees is\r\n  greater than the amount due the claimant; thus, we decline to do so.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4501","title":"Horry County v.

Padgett, Jr., of Loris, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKONDUROS,\r\n  J.:Â  Horry County (the County)\r\n  appeals the special referee's order finding the County failed to establish an\r\n  equitable lien on certain property and giving priority to Horry County State\r\n  Bank's mortgage.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBranch Banking and\r\n  Trust Company (BB&amp;T) initiated a foreclosure action against certain property\r\n  in Horry County.Â  The property was sold by the County at auction to Michael R.\r\n  Ray as representative of Park-Ray Landscape, Inc. (Park-Ray).Â  Ray issued a\r\n  cashier's check to the County as payment for his bid on the property.Â  By all\r\n  accounts, the check appeared on its face to be regular and valid.Â  The County\r\n  disbursed funds to BB&amp;T in satisfaction of its outstanding mortgage on the\r\n  property before the check cleared.Â  The County then discovered the cashier's\r\n  check from Park-Ray had been dishonored.Â  On July 31, 2002, the County filed a lis\r\n    pendens on the property.Â  Within a few days, Park-Ray delivered a second\r\n  cashier's check to the County.Â  That check was subsequently found to be\r\n  fraudulent as was the first check.Â  On August 1, Park-Ray gave a mortgage on\r\n  the property to Horry County State Bank (HCSB).Â  HCSB investigated the title to\r\n  the property and on August 19 recorded its mortgage.Â  The County cancelled its lis\r\n    pendens on August 27.[1]Â  \r\nPark-Ray defaulted\r\n  on the mortgage held by HCSB and HCSB sold the property.Â  The proceeds from\r\n  that sale are being held in escrow by HCSB subject to the Countyâ€™s claim to the\r\n  proceeds.Â  At trial before the special referee, the attorneys who handled the\r\n  loan closing testified the title examinerâ€™s documents indicated a lis\r\n    pendens was filed against the property on July 31.Â  They further testified the\r\n  examination sheet did not indicate the lis pendens had been removed. The\r\n  special referee determined the lis pendens filed by the County was\r\n  invalid and ineffective because the County did not commence a lawsuit within\r\n  twenty days after the filing of the lis pendens.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  County's claim to the proceeds did not take priority over the claim of HCSB.Â  The\r\n  special referee further found the County did not meet the requirements to establish\r\n  an equitable lien on the property that would take priority over HCSB's\r\n  mortgage.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court's standard of review in equitable matters is\r\n  our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Williams v. Wilson,\r\n  349 S.C. 336, 339-40, 563 S.E.2d 320, 322 (2002). &quot;An action to establish\r\n  an equitable lien and to establish lien priorities is an action in equity.&quot;Â  Fibkins v. Fibkins, 303 S.C. 112, 115, 399 S.E.2d 158, 160 (Ct. App.\r\n  1990) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;By the same token, an action to foreclose a\r\n  mortgage is an action in equity.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Constructive and Actual\r\n  Notice\r\nThe County contends\r\n  the special referee erred in finding the lis pendens did not provide\r\n  notice to HCSB of the County's interest in the property.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  15-11-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005) sets forth the timing requirements\r\n  for filing a notice of lis pendens.Â  In an action affecting the title to\r\n  real property, a party may file, not more than twenty days before filing a\r\n  complaint, notice of the pendency of an action containing the names of the\r\n  parties, the object of the action, and the description of the property affected.Â  Id.\r\nSection\r\n  15-11-20 of the South Carolina Code (2005) explains the effect of filing a lis\r\n    pendens.\r\n\r\n\tFrom\r\n  the time of filing only, the pendency of the action shall be constructive\r\n  notice to a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby, and\r\n  every person whose conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently executed or\r\n  subsequently recorded shall be deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer\r\n  and shall be bound by all proceedings taken after the filing of such notice to\r\n  the same extent as if he were made a party to the action. For the purposes of\r\n  this section, an action shall be deemed to be pending from the time of filing\r\n  such notice.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n&quot;The purpose of a notice of pendency of an action is to\r\n  inform a purchaser or encumbrancer that a particular piece of real property is\r\n  subject to litigation.&quot; Â Pond\r\n    Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351\r\n  S.C. 1, 16, 567 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  &quot;Generally, the filing of a lis pendens places a cloud\r\n  on title which prevents the owner from freely disposing of the property before\r\n  the litigation is resolved.&quot;Â  Id. at 17, 567 S.E.2d at 889. \r\n\r\n\tThe lis pendens mechanism is not designed to aid either side in a dispute\r\n  between private parties. Rather, lis pendens is designed primarily to protect\r\n  unidentified third parties by alerting prospective purchasers of property as to\r\n  what is already on public record, i.e., the fact of a suit involving\r\n  property. Thus, it notifies potential purchasers that there is pending\r\n  litigation that may affect their title to real property and that the purchaser\r\n  will take subject to the judgment, without any substantive rights.\r\n\r\nId.Â  (quoting 51 Am. Jur. 2d Lis Pendens Â§ 2 (2000)). \r\nThe\r\n  special referee relied on South Carolina National Bank v. Cook, 291 S.C.\r\n  530, 354 S.E.2d 562 (1987), in awarding the disputed funds to HCSB.Â  In Cook,\r\n  Myrtle Beach Lumber Company, Inc. (the Lumber Company) filed a notice of lis\r\n    pendens on November 8, 1977 but did not file its summons and complaint\r\n  until more than twenty days later on December 1, 1977.Â  Id. at 531, 354\r\n  S.E.2d at 562.Â  On December 5, 1977, South Carolina National Bank obtained a\r\n  judgment lien against the owner of a one half interest in the property.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Eventually, as a result of the litigation instituted by the Lumber Company, the\r\n  property was deeded to the Lumber Company, who conveyed it to the Cooks.Â  Id.Â \r\n  When SCN sought to foreclose its judgment lien, the Cooks argued SCN's interest\r\n  in the property was subordinate to their own.Â  Id. at 532, 354 S.E.2d at\r\n  562.Â  The supreme court disagreed stating:Â  &quot;Since the legislature clearly\r\n  intended that a lis pendens not be filed more than twenty days before the\r\n  complaint, we hold the premature filing of the lis pendens rendered it\r\n  invalid.Â  Since the lis pendens filed by Lumber Company was ineffective, SCN\r\n  was not bound by the prior proceedings and its lien was not extinguished.&quot;Â  Id. at 532-33, 354 S.E.2d at 563.\r\nLikewise,\r\n  in the case before us, the County failed to file a summons and complaint within\r\n  the twenty day period as required by statute.Â  Therefore, the lis pendens was rendered invalid and could not have provided constructive notice of any\r\n  claim by the County to HCSB.\r\nThe\r\n  County argues even if HCSB was not put on constructive notice by the lis\r\n    pendens, HCSB had actual notice of the County's interest in the property.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  County argues the chain of title contained several red flags, in addition to\r\n  the lis pendens, that provided actual notice to HCSB of the County's\r\n  claim.Â  First, the outstanding mortgage of BB&amp;T was not marked satisfied.Â \r\n  However, the Statement of Disbursement from the master-in-equity indicated the\r\n  initial sale of the property was final and that the funds had been disbursed to\r\n  BB&amp;T.[2]Â \r\n  The deed conveying the property to Park-Ray appeared normal and was duly recorded.\r\n  Furthermore, according to the closing attorneys' testimony in the record, their\r\n  services were procured by Ray and Park-Ray.[3]Â \r\n  We are reluctant to impute whatever knowledge may have been revealed by the\r\n  title examination to HCSB when it is unclear who actually represented HCSB's\r\n  interests in the closing.Â  See Costas v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan\r\n    Ass'n, 283 S.C. 94, 99, 321 S.E.2d 51, 54 (1984) (finding knowledge of closing\r\n  attorney was not imputed to bank when attorney was procured and paid by the\r\n  borrower and was not under the sole direction of the bank). \r\nEven\r\n  if the title examination put HCSB on inquiry notice[4] of the County's claim, it appears any inquiry would have resulted in assurances\r\n  from the County that the matter had been or was about to be resolved.[5]Â \r\n  The County's attorney testified that once a second cashier's check was issued\r\n  in early August, he &quot;figured everything was taken care of.&quot;Â  Believing\r\n  the matter to be resolved, the County did not file a lawsuit and ultimately canceled\r\n  the lis pendens on August 27.[6]Â \r\n  At the time of HCSB's title search, the full extent of Ray's fraudulent conduct\r\n  was not known to the County and could not have been discovered by HCSB.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we cannot conclude the lis pendens or unsatisfied mortgage functioned to\r\n  provide actual notice to HCSB of the County's claim. Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Equitable Lien\r\nThe\r\n  County also contends the special referee erred in finding it failed to\r\n  establish an equitable lien with priority over HCSB's mortgage against the\r\n  property.Â  We disagree.\r\nWith\r\n  respect to the County's interest, it is arguable Park-Ray's conduct gave rise\r\n  to an equitable lien against the property.Â  An\r\n  equitable lien is &quot;neither an estate or property in the thing itself, nor\r\n  a right to recover the thing, but is simply a right of a special nature over\r\n  the thing, which constitutes a charge upon the thing.&quot; Â Fibkins v.\r\n    Fibkins, 303 S.C. 112, 115, 399 S.E.2d 158, 160 (Ct. App. 1990) (quoting Carolina\r\n      Attractions, Inc., v. Courtney, 287 S.C. 140, 145, 337 S.E.2d 244, 247 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1985)). Â &quot;An equitable lien is a 'mere floating equity until a\r\n  judgment or decree subjecting the property to the payment of the debt or claim\r\n  is rendered, but even though not judicially recognized until a judgment\r\n  declaring its existence, it relates back to the time it was created by the\r\n  conduct of the parties.' &quot;Â  Id. (quoting Am. Jur. 2d Liens Â§ 22 (1970)). \r\nWhether\r\n  an equitable lien exists that would take priority over HCSB's interest must be\r\n  considered in conjunction with other well-recognized equitable principles.Â  When\r\n  &quot;one of two innocent parties must suffer loss, it must fall on the party\r\n  who, by incautious and misplaced confidence, has occasioned it or placed it in\r\n  the power of a third party to perpetrate the fraud by which the loss has\r\n  happened.&quot;Â  MI Co. v. McLean, 325 S.C. 616, 624, 482 S.E.2d 597,\r\n  601 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting City Council of Charleston v. Ryan, 22 S.C.\r\n  339 (1884)).Â  Had the County not disbursed funds to BB&amp;T prematurely without\r\n  verifying the existence of the funds, it would not be injured.Â  We are mindful Ray\r\n  is primarily responsible for the parties' injuries; however, as between the\r\n  County and HCSB, we conclude the County must bear the consequences of its\r\n  conduct.Â  Therefore, we cannot accord any potential interest of the County\r\n  priority over the mortgage of HCSB. Â Â \r\nBased\r\n  on all of the foregoing, the order of the special referee is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The County filed several more lis pendens over\r\n  the course of the next ten months.Â  However, none of those seem to be important\r\n  with respect to HCSB's constructive or actual knowledge in this case.\r\n[2] According to HCSB, it is &quot;commonplace&quot; for\r\n  attorneys in Horry County to rely upon the Master's Deed and the Order of the\r\n  Master with respect to a mortgage that remains unsatisfied following a\r\n  foreclosure sale.\r\n[3] According the closing attorneys' testimony, their law\r\n  firm had represented Ray and Park-Ray on some other legal matters, and he\r\n  inquired with the firm about handling the closing of the loan from HCSB.\r\n[4] Inquiry notice is a form of constructive notice that\r\n  may have the same effect as actual notice.Â  See Strother v. Lexington\r\n    County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 64, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 (1998). \r\n[5] We do not make a finding regarding whether the lis\r\n  pendens would have provided actual or inquiry notice to HCSB under\r\n  circumstances other than those existing in this case.\r\n[6] The County's attorney did attempt to investigate the\r\n  matter by speaking with Ray and corresponding with several attorneys named by\r\n  Ray.Â  In fact, the County received faxed correspondence purportedly from an\r\n  Atlanta attorney stating the problem with the first cashier's check was an\r\n  internal banking error and a second check was on its way.Â  In hindsight, it\r\n  appears from the record those faxes may have actually been prepared and sent by\r\n  Ray. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4502","title":"Capital City Insurance Company v.

Randle Moody, II, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J.: In this case, the trial court dismissed appellant Capital City\r\n  Insurance Company's (Capital City) complaint of five counts of breach of\r\n  contract against BP Staff, Incorporated (BP Staff) and one count of fraud against\r\n  Samuel Blanton Phillips, III (Phillips), pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6),\r\n  and 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  We reverse the trial court's order and remand the case\r\n  for further proceedings.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCapital City is a workers' compensation insurance\r\n  company in Columbia, S.C.Â  BP Staff is an employee leasing company wholly owned\r\n  by Phillips and based in Greenville, S.C.Â  Phillips was previously employed by\r\n  SB Phillips Company (SB), attending to payroll and procurement of workers'\r\n  compensation insurance for that company prior to starting BP Staff in July\r\n  2002.Â  \r\nIn August 2002, BP Staff sought workers' compensation\r\n  coverage through the South Carolina Department of Insurance Workers'\r\n  Compensation Assigned Risk Insurance Plan and submitted an application that was\r\n  assigned to Capital City.Â  After reviewing the application, Capital City issued\r\n  a policy in September 2002 to BP Staff and assigned it a higher premium than a\r\n  new company would usually receive; BP Staff was assigned an &quot;experience\r\n  modifier&quot; (modifier) of 1.33 rather than 1.0, meaning BP Staff would be\r\n  charged an extra $33,000 for every $100,000 of payroll.Â  In essence, Capital\r\n  City viewed BP Staff as a successor company to SB because the overwhelming\r\n  majority of workers on BP Staff's payroll were formerly at SB. Â Thus, Capital City\r\n  applied SB's modifier to BP Staff's insurance policy.\r\nBP Staff acquired two subsequent policies from Capital City\r\n  in 2003 and 2004 for its South Carolina operations.Â  Additionally, BP Staff\r\n  acquired two more policies from Capital City in 2004 covering its Virginia,\r\n  Georgia, and Alabama operations.\r\nFrom September 2, 2002, through August 23, 2006, BP Staff\r\n  appealed Capital City's application of the modifier to its policies in several\r\n  administrative proceedings that culminated in affirmance of the modifier by the\r\n  Administrative Law Court.Â  BP Staff then appealed the modifier issue to the South\r\n  Carolina Court of Appeals, which affirmed application of the modifier on\r\n  January 16, 2008.Â  See BP Staff, Inc. v. Capital City Ins. Co.,\r\n  Op. No. 2008-UP-060 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Jan. 16, 2008).Â  However, at the time\r\n  Judge Breeden's first order was filed on May 8, 2006, which dismissed Capital\r\n  City's breach of contract and fraud claims, the modifier issue was still pending\r\n  administrative appeal before the ALC; by the time he issued the June 3, 2007\r\n  order denying the motion to reconsider, the modifier issue had been ruled upon\r\n  by the ALC and was pending on appeal to this court.Â  We analyze this case based\r\n  on the record before the trial court.\r\nOn July 13, 2005, Capital City commenced the present action,\r\n  alleging five counts of breach of contract by BP Staff and one count of fraud\r\n  by Phillips individually.Â  BP Staff and Phillips responded with a motion to\r\n  dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure, asserting the circuit court lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction, and that Capital City failed to state facts sufficient to\r\n  constitute a cause of action.Â  Additionally, BP Staff and Phillips later argued\r\n  in their memorandum in support of dismissal that the case should be dismissed\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, &quot;because there was another action\r\n  pending between the parties for the same claim.&quot;Â  \r\nAt the hearing on November 28, 2005, Capital City argued\r\n  that although its claimed damages would be impacted by application of the\r\n  modifier, BP Staff was still in breach of contract for failure to pay any of\r\n  its premium, with or without the modifier.[1] Â BP Staff denied it\r\n  owed Capital City any premiums, including the undisputed amount derived from the\r\n  1.0 modifier. Â Additionally,\r\n  Capital City contended the administrative court determining the modifier issue\r\n  was without authority to grant any relief sought for breach of contract or\r\n  fraud.Â  As such, it asserted the two disputes were substantively different and\r\n  the case should go forward notwithstanding the pending administrative issue.Â \r\n  Alternatively, Capital City asked that the proceedings be stayed until a ruling\r\n  from the &quot;Appeals Court&quot; was issued.[2]\r\nOn January 12, 2006, the trial court granted the motion to\r\n  dismiss, but the order was not recorded with the clerk of court until May 8,\r\n  2006.Â  After determining the modifier dispute was the &quot;linchpin regarding\r\n  any and all disputes between the parties,&quot; the court found that &quot;the\r\n  administrative process will afford the parties an opportunity to address their\r\n  respective positions and seek a compromise of this matter.&quot;Â  Consequently, the\r\n  court held that, &quot;absent an exhaustion of the [administrative] process,\r\n  the instant action is premature and should be dismissed&quot; pursuant to Rules\r\n  12(b)(6), and alternatively, pursuant to 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(8), SCRCP.\r\nThe trial court denied Capital City's motion to reconsider\r\n  and reinstate on June 30, 2007.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the trial court err in dismissing the complaint\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) when the complaint sets forth sufficient facts\r\n  to support claims for breach of contract and for fraud?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in dismissing the case for\r\n  lack of subject matter  jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) when it did so\r\n  based on a lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies and when such\r\n  doctrine of &nbsp; exhaustion is not jurisdictional?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in dismissing the case\r\n  based on the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine because\r\n  the doctrine does not apply?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in dismissing the case pursuant\r\n  to Rule 12(b)(8), based upon the exhaustion of administrative remedies\r\n  doctrine when only the corporate defendant in this case is a party to the administrative proceedings and when the issues to be decided in the administrative &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proceeding\r\n  and the trial court are not the same?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court applies the same standard of\r\n  review as the trial court when reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245,\r\n  247 (2007).Â  In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on a failure\r\n  to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial court must\r\n  base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The question is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and with\r\n  every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for\r\n  relief.Â  Plyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 645, 647 S.E.2d 188, 192\r\n  (2007).Â  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper if the facts alleged and\r\n  inferences reasonably deducible from them, viewed in the light most favorable\r\n  to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory.Â  Doe,\r\n  373 S.C. at 395, 645 S.E.2d at 247.Â  Moreover, the complaint should not be\r\n  dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the\r\n  action.Â  Id. at 395, 645 S.E. at 248.Â  The trial court's grant of a\r\n  motion to dismiss will be sustained only if the facts alleged in the complaint\r\n  do not support relief under any theory of law.Â  Ashley River Props. I, LLC\r\n    v. Ashley River Props. II, LLC, 374 S.C. 271, 278, 648 S.E.2d 295, 298 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).\r\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, the movant challenges the\r\n  power of the court over the subject matter.Â  &quot;The question of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court.&quot;Â  Chew v.\r\n    Newsome Chevrolet, Inc., 315 S.C. 102, 104, 431 S.E.2d 631 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (citing Bargesser v. Coleman Co., 230 S.C. 562, 96 S.E.2d 825 (1957)).Â \r\n  We are free to decide questions of law with no deference to the trial court.Â  Catawba\r\n    Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State of South Carolina, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).\r\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, the movant seeks dismissal\r\n  of a case because another action is pending between the same parties for the\r\n  same claim.Â  While we utilize the same standard of review as the circuit court\r\n  in scrutinizing the application of Rule 12(b)(8), each of the components of the\r\n  rule are determined as a matter of law and thus we apply a de novo standard of\r\n  review to the grant or denial of this motion. Â See Miami Sand &amp;\r\n    Gravel, LLC v. Nance, 849 N.E.2d 671, 676 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006).Â  In other\r\n  words, we may determine whether there is another action involving the same\r\n  parties, claims (or subject matter), and remedies as a matter of law.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe primary focus of this appeal is whether Capital City was\r\n  required to exhaust the administrative process concerning the proper modifier\r\n  to BP Staff's premium before it could proceed on an action for breach of\r\n  contract and fraud.[3]Â \r\n  Therefore, we address the threshold issues of subject matter jurisdiction and\r\n  exhaustion of administrative remedies first even though the trial court apparently\r\n  treated them as alternative holdings.\r\nCapital City asserts that the trial court erred in\r\n  dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1)\r\n  based upon the lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies.Â  We agree.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is defined as &quot;the power to\r\n  hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\n  question belong.&quot;Â  See Skinner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.,\r\n  380 S.C. 91, 93-94, 668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008); Ward v. State, 343 S.C.\r\n  14, 17 n.5, 538 S.E.2d 245, 246 n.5 (2000).Â  This authority is distinct from\r\n  the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, which &quot;is generally\r\n  considered a rule of policy, convenience and discretion, rather than one of law,\r\n  and is not jurisdictional.&quot;Â  Ward, 343 S.C. at 17 n.5, 538 S.E.2d\r\n  at 246 n.5 (internal quotation omitted). Â Additionally, the doctrine of exhaustion\r\n  of administrative remedies is often leveraged &quot;to avoid interference with\r\n  the orderly performance of administrative functions.&quot;Â  Id. at 19\r\n  n.7, 538 S.E.2d at 247 n.7.Â  Consequently, a &quot;failure to exhaust\r\n  administrative remedies goes to the prematurity of a case, not subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Id. at 17 n.5, 538 S.E.2d at 246 n.5.\r\nIn the present case, Capital City's breach of contract and\r\n  fraud claims are part of the general class of cases which the court of common\r\n  pleas has jurisdiction to hear.Â  The mere fact that Capital City was also\r\n  engaged in an administrative proceeding regarding the modifier did not divest\r\n  the circuit court of its power to hear and determine the claims of breach of\r\n  contract and fraud. Â Thus, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to\r\n  hear these types of claims and erred in dismissing Capital City's complaint pursuant\r\n  to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\nNext, Capital City asserts the trial court erred in\r\n  dismissing the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, based upon\r\n  exhaustion principles because the complaint sets forth sufficient facts to\r\n  support claims for breach of contract and for fraud, which are not subject to\r\n  the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies.Â  We agree.\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has indicated that\r\n  dismissal may be proper under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state a\r\n  claim where the opposing party is required to exhaust its administrative\r\n  remedies as a matter of law, but failed to do so.Â  See Unisys Corp.\r\n    v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 346 S.C. 158, 176, 551 S.E.2d 263, 273\r\n  (2001) (stating that exhaustion of remedies precludes original resort to courts\r\n  where an administrative agency is granted exclusive jurisdiction by the express\r\n  terms of a statute).Â  Thus, we must determine whether exhaustion of\r\n  administrative remedies was required as a matter of law; if not, we next\r\n  determine whether the court abused its discretion in dismissing the case until\r\n  exhaustion of the administrative process is complete in order to assist in the disposition\r\n  of the circuit court proceeding.Â  See Stanton v. Town of Pawley's\r\n    Island, 309 S.C. 126, 128, 420 S.E.2d 502, 503 (1992) (&quot;[T]he question\r\n  of whether to require the plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies was a\r\n  matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge,&quot; which will not be\r\n  disturbed absent an abuse of discretion).[4]\r\nInitially, we note &quot;[a] party is not required\r\n  to exhaust administrative remedies if the issue is one that cannot be ruled\r\n  upon by the administrative body.&quot;Â  Charleston Trident Home Builders,\r\n    Inc. v. Town Council of Town of Summerville, 369 S.C. 498, 502, 632 S.E.2d\r\n  864, 867 (2006) (citing Ward, 343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d 245).Â  For\r\n  example, in Thomas Sand Co. v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 109 (Ct. App. 2002), respondent Colonial argued appellant Sand's failure\r\n  to exhaust administrative remedies precluded a tort action against third\r\n  parties.Â  Id. at 412, 632 S.E.2d at 114-15.Â  This court disagreed and held\r\n  the following:\r\n\r\n  If this were an appeal from the denial of the permit through\r\n    the administrative process in which [the agency] was the appropriate fact\r\n    finder, Thomas Sand would clearly be required to exhaust its administrative\r\n    remedies prior to bringing suit. . . . However, in a tort action against a\r\n    third&nbsp;party, no such exhaustion requirement exists.Â  The question is not\r\n    whether the permit would have been granted but whether Thomas Sand was damaged\r\n    . . . .Â  [The agency] is not the appropriate fact finder to answer this\r\n    question.Â  The jury is.\r\n  The basic purpose of the exhaustion requirement,\r\n    to allow the agency to render a final decision and set forth its reasons for\r\n    the permit denial, would not assist the court in this instance.Â  The alleged\r\n    wrong is not one which the administrative process was designed to redress. Â &quot;The\r\n    doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies only comes into play when a\r\n    litigant attempts to invoke the original jurisdiction of a circuit court to\r\n    adjudicate a claim based on a statutory violation for which the legislature has\r\n    provided an administrative remedy.&quot; Â A litigant need not exhaust\r\n    administrative remedies where &quot;there are no administrative remedies for\r\n    the wrongs it assertedly suffered.&quot;\r\n\r\nThomas Sand, 349 S.C. at 413, 563 S.E.2d at 115 (quoting Med. Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc. of Md. v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assocs., 92\r\n  Md. App. 551, 609 A.2d 353 (Md. App. 1992)).\r\nHere, although Capital City was a party to an\r\n  administrative proceeding related to the case at bar at the time of Judge\r\n  Breeden's first order, its breach of contract and fraud claims are not based on\r\n  a statute for which the legislature mandates the pursuit of an administrative remedy;\r\n  in short, Capital City's claims alleging breach of contract and fraud are not\r\n  wrongs for which the administrative scheme was designed to redress.[5] Â Accordingly, as in Thomas Sand,\r\n  Capital City was not required, as a matter of law, to exhaust the administrative\r\n  process regarding the modifier before filing the current action in circuit\r\n  court for breach of contract and fraud. Â \r\nAlthough the legislature has not mandated\r\n  exhaustion of the claims, we recognize the trial court's perception that the\r\n  administrative process, at least in part, would provide some assistance in\r\n  resolution of the claims pending in the circuit court.Â  Moreover, Capital City\r\n  possibly could have secured a judgment in the circuit court before the proper\r\n  modifier was determined and applied by the administrative process, thereby\r\n  raising the specter of interference with administrative review.Â  On the other\r\n  hand, any applicable statute of limitations must also be considered.Â  The court\r\n  has broad discretion in its supervision over the progression and disposition of\r\n  a circuit court case in the interests of justice and judicial economy. Â See Williams v. Bordon's, Inc., 274 S.C. 275, 279, 262 S.E.2d 881, 883\r\n  (1980) (&quot;The authority of the court to grant continuances and to determine\r\n  the order in which cases shall be heard is derived from its power to hear and\r\n  decide cases.Â  This adjudicative power of the court carries with it the\r\n  inherent power to control the order of its business to safeguard the rights of\r\n  litigants.&quot;). Â While the court erred in basing its decision on mandatory\r\n  exhaustion which was not applicable to this case, we may also determine in a\r\n  nonmandatory exhaustion context whether the circuit court abused its discretion\r\n  in ordering dismissal of the case over some less drastic remedy, such as a\r\n  continuance or stay, in order to obtain the benefit of the administrative\r\n  process.[6] \r\nThe United States Supreme Court has previously\r\n  provided guidance resolving the apparent dilemma wherein a party's judicial\r\n  action is caught between the rock of the statute of limitations and the hard\r\n  place of continuing administrative proceedings that impact the judicial\r\n  action.Â  In Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, 86 S. Ct. 781\r\n  (1966), the Court held that an action should have been stayed rather than\r\n  dismissed when the petitioner's treble damages claim &quot;[could] not be\r\n  easily reinstituted at a later time.Â  Such claims are subject to the [s]tatute\r\n  of [l]imitations and are likely to be barred by the time the [agency]\r\n  acts.&quot;Â  Id. at 787.Â  Similarly, the Supreme Court previously held\r\n  that, &quot;[w]hen it appeared in the course of the litigation that an\r\n  administrative problem, committed to the [agency], was involved, the court\r\n  should have stayed its hand pending the [agency's] determination.&quot;Â  Gen.\r\n    Am. Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado Terminal Co., 308 U.S. 422, 433 (1940).Â  The\r\n  Supreme Court suggested the case should not be dismissed; rather, &quot;the\r\n  cause should be held pending the conclusion of an appropriate administrative\r\n  proceeding.&quot; Â Id. Â We find this reasoning persuasive. Â Therefore,\r\n  where a party would be harmed by the running of the statute of limitations or\r\n  otherwise prejudiced if its claim is dismissed because a related matter is undergoing\r\n  administrative review, a trial court seeking to withhold determination of a\r\n  circuit court case pending resolution of an administrative proceeding that may\r\n  impact the circuit court case should properly consider a stay or continuance of\r\n  the judicial action until the administrative proceedings have concluded.Â  Consequently,\r\n  &quot;[w]here suit is brought after the first administrative decision and\r\n  stayed until remaining administrative proceedings have concluded[,] judicial\r\n  resources are conserved and both parties fully protected.&quot;Â  United\r\n    States v. Mich. Nat'l Corp., 419 U.S. 1, 6 (1974).\r\nIn the present case, the trial court dismissed\r\n  Capital City's breach of contract and fraud claims due to the ongoing\r\n  administrative proceedings concerning the modifier instead of staying or\r\n  continuing the circuit court proceeding.Â  However, the court's order does not\r\n  reflect consideration given to any applicable statute of limitations. Â See,\r\n    e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-3-530(1) &amp; (7) (2005). Â A party should not\r\n  be required to &quot;roll the dice&quot; on whether a collateral administrative\r\n  proceeding will conclude prior to the running of an applicable statute of\r\n  limitations in order to preserve a claim properly within the jurisdiction of\r\n  the circuit court. Â Even utilizing an abuse of discretion standard based upon\r\n  the nonmandatory exhaustion context of the breach of contract and fraud claims,\r\n  we find Capital City would be prejudiced by dismissal in light of the problem\r\n  posed by any applicable statute of limitations.Â  Thus, the court abused its\r\n  discretion in ordering a dismissal as opposed to a stay or continuance due to\r\n  this prejudice.[7]\r\nAs previously indicated, as to the breach of contract and\r\n  fraud claims, Capital City was not required to exhaust administrative remedies\r\n  as a matter of law.Â  This case is merely impacted by another administrative\r\n  proceeding, not one itself requiring the exhaustion of the administrative\r\n  process.Â  Since the complaint adequately sets forth facts supporting the claims\r\n  in this case, and since the court erred in its disposition of the exhaustion\r\n  issue, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, was likewise improper.\r\nFinally, Capital City asserts the trial court erred in\r\n  dismissing the case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  We agree.\r\nIn South Carolina, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(8)\r\n  may be proper when there is (1) another action pending, (2) between the same\r\n  parties, (3) for the same claim.Â  Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  The rule has historic\r\n  ties to a former statute[8] providing a defendant a similar opportunity to demur; our supreme court\r\n  traditionally interpreted that statute narrowly, stating that it only applied\r\n  when there was identity of parties, causes of action and relief.Â  S.C. Public\r\n    Serv. Comm'n v. City of Rock Hill, 268 S.C. 405, 408, 234 S.E.2d 228, 229\r\n  (1977); see also James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 96-97 (2d ed. 1996).Â  We find this approach consistent with modern day practice\r\n  under rules similar to our Rule 12(b)(8).Â  See, e.g., Beatty v.\r\n    Liberty Mut. Ins. Group, 893 N.E.2d 1079, 1084 (Ind. App. Ct. 2008)\r\n  (applying 12(b)(8) dismissal &quot;where the parties, subject matter, and\r\n  remedies are precisely the same, and it also applies when they are only substantially\r\n  the same.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we interpret the rule narrowly such that the\r\n  claim must be precisely or substantially the same in both proceedings in order\r\n  for the drastic remedy of dismissal to be appropriate under Rule 12(b)(8).[9]\r\nHere, while we respectfully recognize that the administrative\r\n  claim may have some relationship or impact upon the circuit court action, we\r\n  also recognize that the administrative proceeding and the circuit court action\r\n  are fundamentally and structurally different from each other.Â  Therefore, based\r\n  upon the record herein, dismissal of Capital City's action under Rule 12(b)(8),\r\n  SCRCP, was improper.[10]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial court order and\r\n  remand this case for further proceedings.Â  Since there was a request to stay\r\n  that the circuit court did not address, the parties, upon remand, may request\r\n  that the trial court impose a stay or continuance as may be appropriate.[11]\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the hearing, Capital City\r\n  claimed BP Staff owed approximately $400,000 in unpaid premiums if the 1.0\r\n  modifier was applied, or approximately $700,000 if the 1.33 modifier was\r\n  applied.\r\n[2] Since the modifier issue was\r\n  pending on appeal before the ALC at the time Capital City made this statement,\r\n  we interpret Capital City's request to have meant the ALC rather than the South\r\n  Carolina Court of Appeals.\r\n[3] We need not address whether\r\n  the modifier issue is properly within the administrative review process since\r\n  that issue is not in dispute.Â  We only determine what impact that proceeding\r\n  has on the trial court's determination to dismiss the circuit court action.\r\n[4] In Stanton, the supreme court further explained that in order to reverse\r\n  the trial court's order on the issue of exhaustion, the plaintiff &quot;must\r\n  show that as a matter of law, he was not required to exhaust administrative\r\n  remedies or that the trial judge's ruling was based upon facts for which there\r\n  is no evidentiary support.&quot; Id. at 128, 420 S.E.2d at 503.\r\n[5] The issue of exhaustion of\r\n  administrative remedies has recently been addressed by this court in Oakwood\r\n    Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control,\r\n  Op. No. 4485 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Jan. 12, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at\r\n  51).Â  As noted in the concurring opinion, &quot;absent an exception, so long as\r\n  there is an opportunity for completion and review of a matter, then the parties\r\n  must avail themselves of the entire administrative process prior to seeking\r\n  judicial relief.&quot;Â  Id. at 68.Â  However, the situation herein\r\n  differs from that in Oakwood because no opportunity existed for\r\n  completion or review of Capital Cityâ€™s breach of contract or fraud claims by the\r\n  administrative process due to the type of claim involved; thus, Capital City's\r\n  claims were not subject to mandatory exhaustion.\r\n[6] We recognize the court's\r\n  decision was based on mandatory exhaustion.Â  However, due to some overlap in\r\n  the court's language, we have analyzed the court's order from the perspective\r\n  of a proceeding not requiring exhaustion as a matter of law.Â Â  We apply an\r\n  abuse of discretion standard to the decision to utilize the administrative\r\n  process prior to disposition of the circuit court case.\r\n[7] We note the possibility a dismissal, as opposed to a stay, in some\r\n  circumstances may be upheld where there is some assurance there will be no\r\n  prejudice to any rights of the parties involved; however, we need not reach\r\n  this issue here today as this case does not present that situation. Â See,\r\n    e.g., Mich. Nat'l Corp., 419 U.S. at 5.\r\n[8] The former statute, Section\r\n  10-642(3) of the South Carolina Code (1962), read in part as follows:Â \r\n  &quot;The defendant may demur to the complaint when it shall appear upon the\r\n  face thereof that: (3) There is another action pending between the same parties\r\n  for the same cause.&quot;\r\n[9] Under the peculiar facts of\r\n  this case, our conclusion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8) would be the same even if\r\n  we applied an abuse of discretion standard as to the trial court's Rule\r\n  12(b)(8) analysis.\r\n[10] Because of our disposition\r\n  herein, we need not address appellant's claim that the court erred in applying\r\n  its ruling equally to both BP Staff and Phillips.\r\n[11] We note that BP Staff's\r\n  petition for certiorari in the administrative matter regarding the modifier is\r\n  currently pending before the South Carolina Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4503","title":"Laser Supply and Services, Inc. v.

(Laser) seeks review of the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order awarding damages and attorney fees to Respondent Orchard Park\r\n  Associates (Orchard).Â  The essence of Laser's appeal is a challenge to the\r\n  ruling that the parties' contract called for completion of work on a &quot;per\r\n  building&quot; basis, rather than completion of work when the specified quantities\r\n  of materials had been exhausted.Â  We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part, and remand for additional findings on the issue of attorney\r\n  fees and costs.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\nHISTORY\r\nOn or about March 4, 2003, Laser and Orchard entered into a contract for roof repair work at the Orchard Park Apartments\r\n  in Greenville (the roof contract).Â  Later, on April 1, 2003, the parties entered into a separate contract for exterior wood siding repair and replacement\r\n  at the same site (the siding contract).Â  Incorporated into the siding contract\r\n  is a document entitled &quot;EXHIBIT I - SCOPE OF WORK.&quot;Â  Exhibit I limits\r\n  the quantities of materials that may be used for the work and requires Orchard's\r\n  approval of a change order prior to Laser's use of quantities exceeding those\r\n  limits.Â  Notably, the contract affirms that, prior to its execution, Laser had\r\n  inspected the premises for job conditions.Â  However, Laser did not perform such\r\n  an inspection prior to executing the contract.Â  \r\nExhibit I also includes a payment\r\n  schedule allowing Laser to submit invoices after the completion of work on\r\n  specified buildings and requiring Orchard to remit payment within twenty-one\r\n  days of each invoice date.Â  Laser began the remediation work in April 2003 and\r\n  submitted its first invoice to Orchard on April 11, seeking payment for the\r\n  completion of work on the clubhouse, shop, and four apartment buildings, even\r\n  though Laser did not actually complete work on those buildings until sometime\r\n  after May 1.Â  Laser's first five invoices were approved for payment soon after\r\n  Laser submitted them.Â  However, Orchard did not actually process payments on\r\n  those invoices until August 8.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nConAm Management Corporation (ConAm) was\r\n  responsible for administering both contracts on behalf of Orchard.Â  ConAm's\r\n  Southeast Regional Maintenance Director, David Young (Young), drafted the\r\n  contracts and oversaw Laser's work progress.Â  Soon after Laser began the\r\n  remediation, Young noticed workmanship defects that remained unresolved for\r\n  several weeks, despite his repeated requests for corrections.Â  He also noticed\r\n  that Laser was unnecessarily exceeding the quantity limits on materials.Â  On\r\n  May 1, Young requested Laser to submit a daily or weekly wood usage control\r\n  sheet.Â  Nonetheless, Laser did not submit usage logs as the project\r\n  progressed.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nOn June 2, Young directed Laser to cease\r\n  further work on the buildings until it addressed and resolved certain\r\n  workmanship defects.Â  On June 19, Young presented a punch list to Laser and set\r\n  June 27 as a deadline for resolution of the listed items.Â  Laser did not meet\r\n  that deadline.Â  On July 31, Laser submitted a request for a change order to\r\n  allow for additional materials to complete the siding contract, but\r\n  Orchard denied this request.Â  \r\nOn August 12, Laser sent an e-mail to\r\n  ConAm's Regional Portfolio Manager, John Deneen, and to Young notifying them\r\n  that August 15 would be Laser's last day on the job.Â  Orchard later notified\r\n  Laser that it was terminating the contract and that it would hire a replacement\r\n  contractor to finish the project.Â  By November 20, Orchard signed a remediation\r\n  contract with another contractor, Services Unlimited.Â  Services Unlimited\r\n  completed the work by December 19, and Orchard paid Services Unlimited a total\r\n  of $41,400.Â  \r\nSeveral months later, Laser filed an\r\n  action for breach of contract, along with several other causes of action,\r\n  against Orchard and ConAm.Â  Orchard responded with a breach of contract\r\n  counterclaim and several other counterclaims.Â  Orchard and ConAm then filed separate\r\n  motions for summary judgment on all of Laser's claims on the ground that Laser\r\n  failed to obtain the necessary licensure for the work required by the\r\n  contracts.Â  The circuit court granted Orchard's and ConAm's summary judgment motions\r\n  and entered judgment against Laser on all of its claims.Â  Laser appealed the\r\n  circuit court's summary judgment order; however, this court dismissed the\r\n  appeal because of Laser's failure to comply with Rule 207, SCACR.[1]\r\nAs to Orchard's counterclaims, Orchard\r\n  elected to abandon all of its claims except the breach of contract claim\r\n  relating to the siding contract.Â  The circuit court conducted a trial on the\r\n  breach of contract claim and awarded Orchard damages in the amount of $36,795\r\n  and attorney fees and costs in the amount of $86,923.87.[2]Â \r\n  The circuit court later issued a Supplemental Order reducing the damages award\r\n  to $24,195.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the\r\n  circuit court err in concluding that the parties to the siding contract\r\n  intended for the work to be completed on a &quot;per building&quot; basis?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the\r\n  circuit court err in finding that Laser breached the siding contract? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the\r\n  circuit court err in awarding damages to Orchard in the amount of $24,195?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.\r\n    Did the\r\n  circuit court err in awarding attorney fees and costs to Orchard in the amount\r\n  of $86,923.87?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\nA cause of action for breach of contract seeking money\r\n  damages is an action at law.Â  Eldeco, Inc. v. Charleston County Sch. Dist.,\r\n  372 S.C. 470, 476, 642 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2007).Â  In an action at law tried\r\n  without a jury, this court reviews the trial court's decision to correct only errors\r\n  of law.Â  Seago v. Horry County, 378 S.C. 414, 422, 663 S.E.2d 38, 42&nbsp;(2008).\r\n  Â The trial court's factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless\r\n  there is no evidence in the record that would reasonably support its findings.Â  Id. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Parties'\r\n  intent for completion of work\r\nLaser\r\n  contends that the circuit court erred in concluding that the siding contract\r\n  unambiguously required completion of the work on a &quot;per building&quot;\r\n  basis.Â  Laser argues that (1) the contract was ambiguous with regard to the\r\n  required scope of work; and (2) extrinsic evidence showed that the parties\r\n  intended for the work to be considered complete when the quantities of\r\n  materials specified in the contract had been exhausted.Â  We disagree. \r\nWhen\r\n  interpreting a contract, a court must ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intention of the parties.Â  Chan v. Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 289, 395\r\n  S.E.2d 731, 734 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  To determine the intention of the parties,\r\n  the court &quot;must first look at the language of the contract . . . .&quot;Â  C.A.N.\r\n    Enters., Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373,\r\n  377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988).Â  \r\nWhen the language of a contract\r\n  is clear and unambiguous, the determination of the parties' intent is a question of law for the court.Â  See Hawkins\r\n    v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;1997).Â  Interpretation of a contract is governed by the objective\r\n  manifestation of the parties' assent at the time the contract was made, rather\r\n  than the subjective, after-the-fact meaning one party assigns to it.Â  Bannon\r\n    v. Knauss, 282 S.C. 589, 593, 320 S.E.2d 470, 472&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;1984).Â  A court must enforce an unambiguous contract according\r\n  to its terms regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or\r\n  the parties' failure to guard their rights carefully.Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay,\r\n  328 S.C. 329, 340, 491 S.E.2d 583, 589 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nWhether\r\n  an ambiguity exists in the language of a contract is also a question of law.Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Natural Res.s v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C 617, 623, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  A contract is ambiguous\r\n  when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a\r\n  reasonably intelligent person who (1) has examined the context of the entire\r\n  integrated agreement; and (2) is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages,\r\n  and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business. Â Hawkins,\r\n  328 S.C. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 878.Â  Once the court decides that the language\r\n  is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the parties.Â  McClellanville,\r\n  345 S.C. at 623, 550 S.E.2d at 303.Â  The determination of the parties' intent\r\n  is then a question of fact.Â  Id. \r\n In the instant case, the siding contract's language\r\n  concerning the scope of work is incapable of more than one meaning, when viewed\r\n  objectively by a reasonable person who has examined the context of the entire\r\n  contract and is aware of the practices and terms as generally understood in the\r\n  construction industry.Â  See Hawkins, 328 S.C. at 592, 493 S.E.2d\r\n  at 878.Â  Exhibit\r\n  I includes a payment schedule allowing invoices to be submitted only after the completion of work on specified buildings.Â  Exhibit I also limits the\r\n  quantities of materials that may be used for the work and requires Orchard's\r\n  approval of a change order prior to Laser's use of quantities exceeding those\r\n  limits.Â  \r\nFurther, the second and third pages of\r\n  Exhibit I to the siding contract contain the following provisions:\r\n\r\n  This contract is issued as a\r\n    UNIT PRICE/NOT TO EXCEED CONTRACT and all repairs shall be itemized by building\r\n    and invoiced at the scheduled price.Â  A log of material quantities used at each\r\n    building shall be kept and initialed by both the Contractor and Regional\r\n    Maintenance Director and shall accompany the respective invoices.Â  Should any\r\n    unforeseen conditions arise which require materials of dimensions and\r\n    classification not included within this Contract, Contractor shall provide as\r\n    [sic] estimate of costs and Regional Portfolio Manager shall be notified and\r\n    shall verify actual conditions and receive ConAm's approval before Contractor\r\n    commences work in this area.\r\n  . . . \r\n  THIS IS A TURNKEY OPERATION AND NO\r\n    ADDITIONAL CHARGES SHALL BE APPLIED TO THIS CONTRACT.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  in original).[3]\r\nReading\r\n  the contract as a whole, the only reasonable interpretation of the scope of\r\n  work provisions is that the parties intended for remediation work to be performed\r\n  on all of the buildings listed in the payment schedule.Â  If the parties had\r\n  intended for completion of work to be reached when the specified quantities of\r\n  materials had been exhausted, there would have been no logical reason for them\r\n  to have included language addressing change orders for use of quantities\r\n  exceeding specified limits.Â  \r\nLaser argues in the alternative that, if\r\n  the contract was unambiguous, the circuit court improperly considered extrinsic\r\n  evidence.Â  Laser assigns error to the circuit court's\r\n  reference in its order to certain testimony and exhibits - outside the four\r\n  corners of the contract - to support its interpretation of the contract.[4]Â  It is reasonable to infer that the circuit court was\r\n  setting forth alternative grounds for its interpretation of the contract.Â  In\r\n  any event, any error in considering the extrinsic evidence was harmless because\r\n  the circuit court's interpretation based on the extrinsic evidence presented at\r\n  trial was consistent with the contract's language.Â  See Jensen v. Conrad, 292\r\n  S.C. 169, 172, 355 S.E.2d 291, 293&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1987) (holding that a judgment will not be reversed for\r\n  insubstantial errors not affecting the result). \r\nII. Laser's\r\n  Breach \r\nLaser argues that the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding that Laser breached the contract because Orchard did not\r\n  give Laser an opportunity to complete the contract requirements and because\r\n  Orchard waived the contract requirements.[5]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe determination of whether a party has\r\n  breached a contract is a question of fact.Â  See Jones v. Ridgely\r\n    Commc'ns, Inc., 304 S.C. 452, 455-56, 405 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1991) (affirming\r\n  jury instruction stating that issues of whether there was a breach of contract\r\n  or whether there was cause to terminate employee were questions of fact).Â  Likewise,\r\n  the determination of whether one's actions constitute waiver is a question of\r\n  fact.Â  See Madren v. Bradford, 378 S.C. 187, 194, 661 S.E.2d 390,\r\n  394 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  The trial court's factual\r\n  findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is no evidence in the\r\n  record that would reasonably support the findings.Â  Seago, 378 S.C. at\r\n  422, 663 S.E.2d at 42.\r\nThe siding contract allows Orchard to\r\n  terminate the contract for cause. The\r\n  contract's definition of &quot;cause&quot; reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  [T]he term &quot;cause&quot; shall\r\n    include, without limitation, Contractor's refusal or neglect to supply a\r\n    sufficient number of properly skilled workmen or a sufficient quantity of\r\n    materials of proper quality at any time.Â  Contractor's failure to properly perform\r\n    all Work in keeping with the progress of the Owner's general construction\r\n    schedule for the project or to properly perform any term, covenant or condition\r\n    contained in this Contract.Â  \r\n\r\nThe record contains\r\n  competent evidence that Laser breached the siding contract and that cause\r\n  existed for the contract's termination as early as the beginning of April\r\n  2003.Â  At that time, Laser was providing defective workmanship and, thus, was\r\n  not properly performing the required work or abiding by the contract's express terms.Â \r\n  Young had to make numerous requests for corrections and had to warn Laser of\r\n  possible termination.Â  Laser's contention that Orchard\r\n  did not give Laser an opportunity to complete the punch list work is\r\n  unpersuasive in light of the evidence that Young made repeated requests,\r\n  throughout the months of April, May, and June, for Laser to correct\r\n  deficiencies in its work.Â  Additionally, as early as April 11, Laser\r\n  submitted an invoice for work that had not actually been completed, in\r\n  contradiction of the contract's terms.Â  \r\nLaser's waiver argument is also\r\n  unavailing.Â \r\n  A waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known\r\n  right.Â  Arcadian\r\n    Shores Single Family Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. Cromer, 373 S.C. 292, 301, 644 S.E.2d 778, 783&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007).Â  Admittedly, the record contains some evidence that Young, as a\r\n  representative of Orchard, may have waived certain contract requirements by his\r\n  verbal communications with Laser's representatives.Â  However, there was equally\r\n  competent evidence that Orchard did not waive the requirements relating to the\r\n  quality of the work to be performed, which Laser breached.Â  \r\nIn sum, there is competent\r\n  evidence in the record that reasonably supports the circuit court's finding\r\n  that Laser breached the siding contract.Â  Therefore, we must affirm that\r\n  finding.Â  See Seago, 378 S.C. at 422, 663 S.E.2d at 42.\r\nIII. Damages\r\nLaser\r\n  argues that the siding contract's termination clause does not provide for the\r\n  damages awarded by the circuit court because it does not address calculation of\r\n  damages in the event that the property owner's costs to complete the contract\r\n  exceed the contract balance.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  siding contract's termination clause states, in pertinent part, the following:\r\n\r\n  In the event of termination for cause,\r\n    Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the\r\n    entire project of which the Work is a part is completely finished.Â  At that\r\n    time, if the amount earned but not paid to Contractor before termination plus\r\n    the unearned portion of the Contract Price at the time of termination exceeds the cost incurred by Owner in finishing the Work, Owner shall pay to\r\n      Contractor the amount of such excess.Â  If the amount earned but not paid to\r\n    Contractor before termination plus the unearned portion of the Contract Price\r\n    at the time of termination exceeds such cost, Contractor shall pay to\r\n      Owner the amount of such excess.Â  The cost incurred by Owner shall include,\r\n    for purposes of the calculations referred to in the two preceding sentences,\r\n    Owner's cost of furnishing materials and finishing the Work, Owner's attorneys'\r\n    fees and any damages incurred by Owner by reason of Contractor's default, plus\r\n    a markup of ten percent (10%) general overhead and ten percent (10%) profit on\r\n    all of such items of cost. \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThe circuit court found that the second\r\n  and third sentences in the termination clause contemplate the same factual\r\n  scenario, but yet mandate opposing outcomes.Â  The court implicitly held that\r\n  this particular paragraph in the contract was ambiguous and found that there\r\n  was a scrivener's error in the third sentence in the termination clause.Â  The\r\n  circuit court found that the parties intended for the word &quot;exceeds&quot;\r\n  in the third sentence to mean &quot;exceeded by&quot; after hearing testimony\r\n  that the parties considered the termination clause to operate as a typical\r\n  termination clause in the context of a construction project.[6]Â  In effect, the circuit\r\n  court reformed the siding contract.Â  See Jordan v. Foster, 264\r\n  S.C. 382, 386, 215 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1975) (holding that trial court properly\r\n  reformed instrument after hearing testimony concerning scrivener's error in\r\n  drafting instrument).Â  \r\nThe circuit court's reformation of the\r\n  third sentence in the termination clause is supported by competent evidence.Â \r\n  Witnesses for both parties testified that the contract required the contractor\r\n  to pay the property owner the amount of the cost to complete the contract less the\r\n  contract balance.Â  \r\nLaser\r\n  also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support Orchard's claimed\r\n  replacement costs.Â  We disagree.Â  At trial, Orchard introduced a copy of its\r\n  contract with Services Unlimited, dated November 20, 2003.Â  That contract sets the total price for the work at $41,400. Â Further, there was testimony\r\n  that, by December 19, Services Unlimited had completed the remediation work\r\n  that Laser began in April.Â  The record also shows payments totaling $41,400\r\n  that Orchard made to Services Unlimited.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Laser contends that Orchard failed to minimize its liquidated damages because\r\n  of its delay in completion of the project.Â  We disagree.Â  The evidence shows\r\n  that the length of time between Laser's last week on the project (August 15)\r\n  and the date of Orchard's contract with Services Unlimited (November 20) was\r\n  reasonable due to the necessity of re-bidding the work and allowing potential\r\n  contractors to inspect the site.Â  \r\nIn sum, the damages award was supported\r\n  by competent evidence and was properly calculated according to the formula in\r\n  the siding contract's termination clause. Â \r\nIV. Attorney\r\n  Fees\r\nLaser argues that the award of attorney fees and costs,\r\n  $86,923.87, is not supported by the record because (1) the roof contract is not\r\n  in the record, and, thus, there is no evidence that any fees or costs\r\n  associated with the roof contract would be supported by a contractual provision\r\n  allowing attorney fees; (2) the amount of attorney fees and costs awarded is\r\n  unreasonable in light of the amount of the damages awarded ($24,195); (3)\r\n  Orchard obtained only $24,195 out of the $123,930 it was seeking throughout the\r\n  litigation and was unsuccessful on several of its claims; and (4) the\r\n  contractual provision for attorney fees does not authorize an award of\r\n  litigation costs.Â  There is some merit to the first ground raised by Laser, but\r\n  we disagree with Laser's remaining contentions.\r\nThe review of attorney fees\r\n  awarded pursuant to a contract is governed by an abuse of discretion standard.Â  See S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co.\r\n    v. Hartough, 375 S.C. 541, 550, 654 S.E.2d\r\n  87, 91&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007) (concluding that, when an award\r\n  of attorney fees is based upon a contract between the parties, the\r\n  determination of the fees is left to the discretion of\r\n  the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion).Â \r\n  An appellate court will not reverse an award unless it is based on an error of\r\n  law or is without any evidentiary support.Â  See Gooding v. St.\r\n    Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598&nbsp;(1997)\r\n  (holding that an abuse of discretion occurs when there is an error of law or a\r\n  factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support).Â  When an attorney's services and the value of those services\r\n  are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the findings\r\n  of fact are supported by any competent evidence.Â  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v.\r\n    Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297&nbsp;(1989).Â  \r\nA. Reasonableness of Fee Amount\r\nIn Baron, the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in awarding attorney fees to the plaintiff, even though the award was greater\r\n  than the plaintiff's recovery.Â  The court concluded that the trial court had\r\n  properly applied the relevant factors, which are as follows:Â  (1) the nature,\r\n  extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor\r\n  necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4)\r\n  the contingency of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the\r\n  locality for similar legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained.Â  Id. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297-98.\r\nHere, the siding contract provision authorizing attorney\r\n  fees states,\r\n\r\n  Contractor shall be liable\r\n    to Owner for all attorneys' fees expended by Owner in furtherance of Owner's\r\n    rights against Contractor under this Contract.Â  In the event of any litigation\r\n    or arbitration arising out of the subject matter of this Contract or the Work\r\n    (whether instituted by Owner, Contractor or another entity), the party to\r\n      this Contract determined by the court or arbitrator to be primarily liable or\r\n      at fault shall be obligated to pay the attorneys' fees of the other party to\r\n      this Contract, the amount of which shall be determined by the court or\r\n    arbitrator and included in the judgment. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nAt trial, counsel for Orchard, Donald Harper, presented\r\n  an affidavit setting forth itemized time entries and itemized expenses that his\r\n  office incurred in representing Orchard in this case from the time that Laser\r\n  filed its complaint through the beginning of July 2006.Â  The affidavit also\r\n  explained the nature and difficulty of the services rendered, counsel's\r\n  professional standing in the community, and the rates customarily charged in\r\n  the Greenville area for similar legal services.Â  However, the affidavit does\r\n  not sufficiently indicate how much pre-trial time was solely attributable to\r\n  the roof contract, for which no evidence of a contractual provision authorizing\r\n  fees was introduced at trial due to Orchard's abandonment of claims related to\r\n  the roof contract.Â  Further, the affidavit does not sufficiently indicate which\r\n  expenses, if any, were solely attributable to the roof contract.Â  Therefore,\r\n  this court has no way of discerning whether the time and expenses solely\r\n  attributable to the roof contract were de minimis or much more significant (for\r\n  example, lengthy segments of a deposition devoted to the roof contract only). \r\nOn its face, Harper's affidavit, combined with the\r\n  beneficial results obtained, generally supports the reasonableness of the\r\n  attorney fee award.Â  However, if the affidavit includes any fees or expenses that\r\n  are attributable solely to the roof contract, that part of the award would not\r\n  be supported by the evidence.Â  The roof contract was not presented at trial,\r\n  and, therefore, the record contains no evidence of a contractual provision\r\n  authorizing an award for attorney fees and expenses related solely to the roof\r\n  contract.Â  \r\nIt is possible that much of\r\n  counsel's time on the case was attributable to both contracts simultaneously or\r\n  solely the siding contract.Â  However, any portion of the award that is attributable\r\n  solely to the roof contract would not be supported by the record.Â  Therefore,\r\n  it is necessary to remand the issue of attorney fees to the circuit court to\r\n  determine if the affidavit includes any fees or expenses that are attributable solely\r\n  to the roof contract.Â  See Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C.\r\n  492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660-61 (1993) (holding that reversal of fee award and\r\n  remand is appropriate where there is a lack of evidence).Â  \r\nB. Costs\r\nLaser argues that the circuit court erroneously included\r\n  expenses in the attorney fees award.Â  However, Laser does not cite any\r\n  authority supporting its argument.Â  Therefore, Laser has abandoned this\r\n  argument.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (requiring the citation of\r\n  authority in the argument portion of an appellant's brief); Hunt v. Forestry\r\n    Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564, 573, 595 S.E.2d 846, 851&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004)\r\n  (holding that issues raised in a brief but not supported by authority are\r\n  deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).Â  \r\nC. Disparity with Damages Award\r\nThe disparity in the amount\r\n  of the damages award and the attorney fees award, by itself, does not\r\n  invalidate the latter.Â  See Rice v. Multimedia, Inc., 318 S.C.\r\n  95, 101, 456 S.E.2d 381, 385 (1995) (addressing disparity of damages award and\r\n  fee award and noting that the amount of recovery and the contingency of\r\n  compensation are only two of the six factors to be considered by the trial\r\n  court in determining an appropriate attorney fees award); Baron Data,\r\n  297 S.C. at 385, 377 S.E.2d at 297-98 (concluding that attorney fees award was\r\n  supported by the record despite the fact that it exceeded damages award).Â  With\r\n  the exception of any possible fees and expenses attributable solely to the roof\r\n  contract, the amount of the fee award was reasonable in light of all of the Baron factors applied by the circuit court.Â  Therefore, its disparity with the\r\n  damages award does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the\r\n  circuit court. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court properly\r\n  concluded that the siding contract unambiguously required the work to be\r\n  completed on a &quot;per building&quot; basis.Â  Further, the circuit court\r\n  properly concluded that Laser breached the siding contract and that Orchard was\r\n  entitled to damages in the amount of $24,195.Â  Therefore, we affirm those\r\n  conclusions in the circuit court's order.Â  \r\nAs to the attorney fees award, any part\r\n  of the award that is attributable solely to the roof contract is not supported\r\n  by the record.Â  The circuit court must make additional\r\n  findings on the time that counsel spent, and the expenses incurred by counsel,\r\n  that are attributable solely to the roof contract and modify the award\r\n  accordingly.Â  Therefore, we reverse the attorney fees award and remand the case\r\n  to the circuit court for additional findings.[7] \r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 207,\r\n  SCACR, requires the appellant to make satisfactory arrangements in writing with\r\n  the court reporter for furnishing the transcript and to order the transcript\r\n  within ten days after the date of service of the notice of appeal.\r\n[2] The\r\n  parties consented to a bench trial in lieu of a jury trial.Â  \r\n[3] A &quot;turnkey\r\n  operation&quot; (or &quot;turnkey contract&quot;) is known in the construction\r\n  industry as a fixed-price, schedule-intensive construction contract in which\r\n  the contractor agrees to a wide variety of responsibilities.Â  Black's Law\r\n    Dictionary 344 (8th ed. 2004).Â  A &quot;unit-price contract&quot; is a\r\n  contract in which payment is made at specified unit rates for each of the\r\n  different types of work performed or materials furnished.Â  See L-J,\r\n    Inc. v. S.C. State Highway Dep't, 270 S.C. 413, 425, 242 S.E.2d 656, 661\r\n  (1978) (dictum).Â  In unit price contracts, there are usually items of work\r\n  which will be required to be performed, but the precise dimensions of the work\r\n  cannot be determined in advance of performance.Â  Id.Â  A party estimates\r\n  the units of work or material of each type anticipated to be required for\r\n  completion of the project.Â  Id. at 425-26, 242 S.E.2d at 661.\r\n[4]Â  See In re\r\n  Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 275, 539 S.E.2d 703, 708 (2000) (holding\r\n  that the parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of\r\n  agreements or understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a written\r\n  instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or\r\n  explain the written instrument).\r\n[5] Laser\r\n  also contends that Orchard substantially breached the contract by delaying\r\n  payment on several invoices.Â  The circuit court did not directly address this\r\n  question in its order, and Laser did not raise the question in its motion for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  Therefore, this question is not preserved for review.Â  SeeHardaway\r\n    Concrete Co., Inc. v. Hall Contracting Corp., 374 S.C. 216, 234, 647 S.E.2d\r\n  488, 497 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding that issue was not preserved for review where\r\n  master did not address issue in order and appellant did not file a motion for\r\n  reconsideration to obtain a ruling on the issue). \r\n[6] It is\r\n  reasonable to infer that the circuit court, and the witnesses who testified on\r\n  this point, meant to say &quot;is exceeded by.&quot; \r\n[7] This court need not address Appellant's remaining arguments,\r\n  as they are either non-dispositive or manifestly without merit.Â  See Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR (stating that a point that is manifestly without\r\n  merit need not be addressed); Whiteside v.

Â We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\nHISTORY\r\nOn September 23, 2003, students Dennis Fortune\r\n  and Desmond Smith approached Marquise and Maurice Stinney, who were walking through\r\n  the school parking lot on their way to football practice.[2]Â \r\n  A heated exchange of words took place, and a faculty member, Coach Joe Norris,\r\n  sensed tension between the students.Â  He attempted to intervene and to prevent\r\n  an altercation, but the students began fighting.Â  Coach Norris wrestled one of\r\n  the students to the ground to prevent him from entering the fight.Â  Another\r\n  faculty member, Coach Warren Coker, tried to intervene in the fight.Â  At this\r\n  time, one of the students inadvertently struck Coach Coker in the face.Â  Other\r\n  school officials and students then arrived to break up the fight.Â  Marquise,\r\n  Maurice, Dennis, and Desmond were immediately suspended from school grounds.Â  \r\nThe next day, Sumter High School's\r\n  Assistant Principal, Randy Gold, notified the Stinneys that Marquise and\r\n  Maurice had been charged with violating District policy due to &quot;Assault\r\n  (simple) Fighting in back parking lot&quot; and that the students were facing a\r\n  recommendation of expulsion for the remainder of the school year. Â The\r\n  notification letter also advised the Stinneys of an upcoming evidentiary\r\n  hearing on the expulsion recommendation.Â  The letter advised the Stinneys that\r\n  they should present all testimony and evidence that they wanted the hearing\r\n  panel to consider and that they could appear with an attorney if they so\r\n  desired.Â  Additionally, the letter admonished the Stinneys that no additional\r\n  evidence would be considered in any appeal of the hearing panel's decision.Â  \r\nAfter separate evidentiary hearings for\r\n  Marquise and Maurice, the hearing panel accepted the recommendation to expel\r\n  both students, and the District so notified the Stinneys.[3]Â \r\n  The Stinneys then obtained an attorney and appealed the hearing panel's\r\n  decision to the District Superintendent, Dr. Zona Jefferson.Â  Dr. Jefferson\r\n  upheld the expulsion decision, and the Stinneys then appealed to the Board.Â  On\r\n  November 4, 2003, the District notified the Stinneys that the Board had upheld\r\n  the decision. \r\nThe Stinneys did not appeal the Board's\r\n  decision to the circuit court.Â  Rather, on September 16, 2005, the Stinneys\r\n  filed a civil action in circuit court against the District, seeking damages based\r\n  on the following causes of action:Â  Failure to Follow Disciplinary Procedures,\r\n  Denial of Due Process, Negligence, and Failure to Supervise.Â  The first cause\r\n  of action, Failure to Follow Disciplinary Procedures, alleges that the District\r\n  failed to follow its policies and procedural manual governing the discipline of\r\n  students.Â  The second claim, Denial of Due Process, alleges that the District's\r\n  actions and omissions deprived the students of their due process rights under\r\n  the state and federal constitutions. In particular, this claim states, in\r\n  pertinent part,\r\n\r\n  Due to the Defendant's acts of\r\n    commission and omission, the Plaintiff's [sic] were denied the right to due\r\n    process under the State and Federal Constitutions including, but not limited to\r\n    the following particulars:\r\n  a. In\r\n    denying the student-Plaintiffs equal protection of the law;\r\n  b. In\r\n    abridging the privileges and immunities of the student-Plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nThe third claim, Negligence, contends\r\n  that the District was negligent in failing to prevent harm to the students and\r\n  in failing to comply with disciplinary guidelines.Â  The fourth claim, Failure\r\n  to Supervise, contends that the District failed to properly supervise the\r\n  students in their care.Â  The damages claimed by the Stinneys include expenses\r\n  to transport Marquise and Maurice to another school and psychotherapy expenses.\r\nThe District sought summary judgment on\r\n  all causes of action, and the circuit court granted summary judgment on the due\r\n  process claim only.Â  The sole ground for partial summary judgment was the\r\n  Stinneys' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.Â  The order specifically\r\n  stated that the Stinneys &quot;failed to fully exhaust all remedies afforded to\r\n  them by the [District] in these types of proceedings.&quot;Â  This appeal\r\n  follows.[4]Â  \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court err in granting summary judgment on the Stinneys' due process\r\n  claim?\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the grant of\r\n  a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard that the trial\r\n  court applies under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341\r\n  S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party\r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Adamson v. Richland County School Dist. One, 332\r\n  S.C. 121, 124, 503 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Stinneys assert the following\r\n  grounds for their challenge to the circuit court's grant of partial summary\r\n  judgment:Â  (1)Â  a direct appeal to the circuit court from the Board's expulsion\r\n  order under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-240 is a judicial remedy; therefore, they\r\n  exhausted their administrative remedies despite their failure to directly\r\n  appeal under section 59-63-240;[5] (2) S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 allows them to file a civil action for\r\n  damages in circuit court, in lieu of a direct appeal from the Board's expulsion\r\n  order; and (3) exhaustion was not required in their case because a direct\r\n  appeal to circuit court under section 59-63-240 would not have provided\r\n  adequate redress.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nGeneral\r\n  Law on Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r\nThe doctrine of exhaustion of\r\n  administrative remedies is generally considered a rule of policy, convenience,\r\n  and discretion, rather than one of law. Â Adamson, 332 S.C. at 125, 503 S.E.2d at 754.Â  The doctrine\r\n  is not jurisdictional.Â  Id.Â  Whether administrative remedies must be\r\n  exhausted is a matter within the circuit court's sound discretion, and this\r\n  decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Hyde\r\n    v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 207, 208, 442 S.E.2d 582,\r\n  582-83 (1994).Â  \r\nThe general rule is that\r\n  administrative remedies must be exhausted absent circumstances that support an\r\n  exception to application of the general rule.Â  Hyde, 314\r\n  S.C. at 208, 442 S.E.2d at 583.Â  When an adequate\r\n  administrative remedy is available to determine a question of fact, one must seek\r\n  the administrative remedy or be precluded from pursuing relief in the courts.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAdequacy\r\n  of Administrative Appeal\r\nThe Stinneys contend that a direct appeal\r\n  from the Board's decision to the circuit court would not have provided them\r\n  with an adequate remedy.Â  They argue that, because the school year in question would\r\n  have ended by the time that the circuit court could hear the appeal, an order\r\n  allowing the students to be reinstated at school would be meaningless for\r\n  Marquise, a high school senior, and Maurice, who already had the option of\r\npetitioning for reinstatement for the following school year.Â  \r\nWe agree that a direct appeal would not\r\n  have provided the Stinneys with any immediate relief.Â  The students'\r\n  reinstatement to school pending an appeal of the Board's expulsion order is\r\n  effectively prohibited by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-240 (2004).Â  This statute\r\n  provides that a student who has been recommended for expulsion may be suspended\r\n  from school and all school activities during the time of the expulsion\r\n  procedures.Â  Therefore, theoretically, the Stinneys would still accumulate at\r\n  least a portion of the damages described in their complaint (i.e., transportation\r\n  and psychotherapy expenses) regardless of the outcome of any direct appeal to\r\n  circuit court.Â  Further, the Stinneys would be unable to seek damages in a direct\r\n  appeal to circuit court.Â  See James Academy of Excellence v.\r\n    Dorchester County School Dist. Two, 376 S.C. 293, 300, 657 S.E.2d 469,\r\n  472-73 (2008) (holding that the circuit court, while sitting as an appellate\r\n  court in an administrative case, exceeded its authority in holding an\r\n  evidentiary hearing on the issue of damages). Â Under these circumstances, a\r\n  direct appeal would likely have been futile.Â  One does not have to exhaust\r\n  administrative remedies when it would be futile to do so.Â  Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 19, 538 S.E.2d 245, 247&nbsp;(2000); see also Video\r\nGaming Consultants, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept. of Revenue, 342 S.C. 34, 39, 535 S.E.2d 642, 645&nbsp;(2000).Â  Â &nbsp;\r\nJudicial\r\nreview under section 1-23-380\r\nFurther, there is merit to the Stinneys' argument that S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380 allows\r\n  them to file a civil action for damages in circuit court, in lieu of a direct\r\n  appeal from the Board's expulsion order.Â  The statute &quot;does not limit\r\n  utilization of or the scope of judicial review available under other means\r\n    of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo provided by law.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added). Â \r\nIn\r\n  any event, judicial review under section 1-23-380 is a judicial, rather than\r\n  administrative, remedy.Â  See Â§ 1-23-380(A) (&quot;A party who has\r\n  exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and\r\n  who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to\r\n  judicial review . . . .&quot;) (emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310(2)\r\n  (2005), as amended by Act. No. 334, Â§ 3, 2008 S.C. Acts 3301, 3303 (defining &quot;agency&quot;\r\n  as &quot;each state board, commission, department, or officer, other than\r\n    the legislature, the courts, or the Administrative Law Court, authorized by\r\n  law to determine contested cases&quot;) (emphasis added); see also Jean Hoefer Toal et al., Appellate\r\n    Practice in South Carolina 48 (2d ed. 2002).Â  Therefore, the Stinneys\r\nexhausted all levels of administrative review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Stinneys have established that they\r\n  have exhausted all of their administrative remedies.Â  Therefore, the circuit\r\n  court's rationale for granting summary judgment on the Stinneys' due process\r\n  claim was erroneous.[6]\r\nAccordingly, the circuit\r\n  court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The record\r\n  contains more than one spelling for &quot;Marquise&quot; (also set forth as &quot;Marquis&quot;),\r\n  but the father's affidavit and the signature line for Marquise's affidavit\r\n  employ the former spelling.Â  We therefore defer to the former spelling and\r\norder that the case caption be amended accordingly.\r\n[2] All four\r\nstudents are now past the age of majority.Â  \r\n[3] Dennis and\r\nDesmond were also expelled for the remainder of the school year.\r\n[4] After the\r\n  Stinneys filed a notice of appeal, the District filed a motion to alter or\r\n  amend the circuit court's order.Â  The District sought clarification of the\r\n  order due to a perceived inconsistency with the circuit court's written\r\n  instructions to opposing counsel for drafting the order.Â  The District sought\r\n  dismissal of all claims related to the expulsion proceedings, rather than\r\n  solely the due process claim, on the ground that the Stinneys failed to exhaust\r\n  their administrative remedies.Â  The circuit court has\r\n  not yet ruled on the District's Rule 59(e) motion, presumably because the\r\n  motion involves matters over which the circuit court had already lost\r\n  jurisdiction when the Stinneys served their notice of appeal.Â  See Rule\r\n  205, SCACR (stating that upon service of the notice of appeal, the appellate\r\ncourt shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal).Â  Â Â Â \r\n[5] Section\r\n  59-63-240 provides that the action of the Board may be appealed &quot;to the\r\nproper court.&quot;\r\n[6] In\r\n  view of our disposition of the above issues, we need not address the Stinneys'\r\n  remaining arguments.Â  See Whiteside\r\n    v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311\r\n  S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding that an appellate court\r\n  need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is\r\ndispositive).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4505","title":"South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles v.

Â Two days before Holtzclaw's suspension\r\n  was due to begin, he sent notice to the DMVH requesting a hearing.Â  On the\r\n  following day, Holtzclaw made a motion in municipal court to have the most\r\n  recent conviction reopened in order to have a new hearing.[2]Â \r\n  The municipal court granted Holtzclaw's motion to reopen the conviction on Ticket\r\n  32881DE on the ground that Holtzclaw &quot;was uninformed of the ramifications\r\n  of entering a plea without consultation with his attorney.&quot;Â  The\r\n  prosecuting attorney, who was present at Holtzclaw's motion, consented to the\r\n  reopening, as indicated by the signature on the order.Â  The order also\r\n  indicated it was issued pursuant to Ishmell v. South Carolina Highway Department,\r\n  264 S.C. 340, 215 S.E.2d 201 (1975).\r\nUpon receipt of the\r\n  municipal court's order to reopen the last ticket, the DMV replied directly to\r\n  the judge in a letter, stating:Â  &quot;The Department is in receipt of the\r\n  attached order(s), however, we are unable to process the order due to the\r\n  following:Â  . . . The request to re-open the case does not appear to be timely.&quot;Â \r\n  The municipal court did not respond to the DMV's communication.\r\nThereafter, the\r\n  DMVH held a hearing pursuant to Holtzclaw's request.Â  Holtzclaw testified in\r\n  support of his motion, and also introduced the municipal court's order\r\n  reopening his final conviction.Â  Ultimately, the DMVH Hearing Officer rescinded\r\n  Holtzclaw's driving suspension and found his driving record did not support the\r\n  requirements for a Habitual Offender because the requisite third conviction for\r\n  driving on a suspended license was nullified when the municipal court re-opened\r\n  Holtzclaw's final ticket.Â  DMV appealed the Hearing Officer's order to the ALC,\r\n  which dismissed the appeal.Â  DMV now appeals this determination.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe DMVH is authorized\r\n  to hear contested cases arising from the DMV.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-660 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  Therefore, the DMVH is an agency under the Administrative Procedures\r\n  Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310 (Supp. 2008).Â  Appeals from Hearing Officers\r\n  must be taken to the ALC.Â  Â§ 1-23-660.Â  Section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2008) sets forth the standard of review when the court of appeals\r\n  is sitting in review of a decision by the ALC on an appeal from an\r\n  administrative agency.Â  &quot;The review of the administrative law judge's\r\n  order must be confined to the record.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C).Â  The\r\n  court of appeals may reverse or modify the decision only if substantive rights\r\n  of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision is clearly erroneous\r\n  in light of the reliable and substantial evidence on the whole record,\r\n  arbitrary or otherwise characterized by an abuse of discretion, or affected by\r\n  other error of law.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDMV asserts the ALC erred in upholding the Hearing\r\n  Officer's order rescinding Holtzclaw's suspended driver's license.Â  DMV\r\n  maintains that under section 22-3-1000 of the South Carolina Code (2007), the\r\n  municipal court lacked jurisdiction to hear a motion to reopen Holtzclaw's\r\n  third conviction.Â  We agree; nevertheless, we affirm the ALC's dismissal of DMV's\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\nSections 56-1-1020 and\r\n  56-1-1090 of the South Carolina Code (2006 &amp; Supp. 2008), provide a person\r\n  will be deemed a Habitual Offender if he or she is convicted of the requisite\r\n  number of offenses during a three year period, and will lose driving privileges\r\n  for five years from the date of that determination:\r\n\r\n  An [sic]\r\n    habitual offender shall mean any person whose record as maintained by the\r\n    Department of Motor Vehicles show that he has accumulated the convictions for\r\n    separate and distinct offenses described in subsections (a), (b) and (c)\r\n    committed during a three-year period . . . : \r\n  (a)\r\n    Three or more convictions, singularly or in combination of any of the following\r\n    separate and distinct offenses arising out of separate acts: \r\n  . . .\r\n  \r\n    (4)\r\n      Driving a motor vehicle while his license, Â  permit, or privilege to drive a\r\n      motor vehicle has Â Â Â Â  been suspended or revoked . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 56-1-1020.\r\nAs described above,\r\n  Holtzclaw was convicted of three violations of driving on a suspended license\r\n  within a five month period.Â  Consequently, the DMV was correct to send\r\n  Holtzclaw an official notice of his impending declaration as a Habitual\r\n  Offender.Â  In addition, Holtzclaw was within his rights to request a contested\r\n  hearing before the DMVH regarding that status determination made by the DMV.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-1030 (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nHowever, the record\r\n  reveals Holtzclaw appeared and pled guilty in municipal court to the third\r\n  driving violation on March 16, 2006.Â  Magistrates generally have jurisdiction\r\n  over traffic offenses that are subject to the penalties of either fine or\r\n  forfeiture not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding thirty days.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-550 (2008).Â  Similarly, a municipal court presumptively\r\n  has jurisdiction over traffic offenses and criminal cases to the same extent as\r\n  that conferred on magistrates.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-45 (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Moreover, under section 22-3-1000 of the South Carolina Code (2007), a motion\r\n  for a new trial from a case heard by a magistrate may not be heard unless made\r\n  within five days from the rendering of the judgment.Â  \r\nAs established in section\r\n  14-25-45, the municipal court in this case clearly had subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear a general motion to reopen a conviction of a driving\r\n  violation.Â  &quot;Subject matter jurisdiction refers to the court's power to\r\n  hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\n  question belong.&quot;Â  Great Games, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 339\r\n  S.C. 79, 83 n.5, 529 S.E.2d 6, 8 n.5 (2000) (citations omitted); see also State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  \r\nThe municipal court's\r\n  order to reopen reflects Holtzclaw made his motion on May 2, 2006, outside of\r\n  the five days allowed under section 22-3-1000.Â  By virtue of that statute, DMV\r\n  contends the city judge had lost authority to consider Holtzclaw's motion for a\r\n  new trial; therefore, the order reopening the case is void.Â  &quot;A void\r\n  judgment is one that, from its inception, is a complete nullity and is without\r\n  legal effect and must be distinguished from one which is merely 'voidable.'&quot;Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co., Inc. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286,\r\n  291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995) (citation omitted).\r\nThe situation here\r\n  is analogous to the issue before the supreme court in State v. Campbell,\r\n  376 S.C. 212, 656 S.E.2d 371 (2008).Â  In Campbell, a defendant pled\r\n  guilty to several charges; however, the defendant later refused to testify at\r\n  his co-defendant's trial, pursuant to his plea agreement.Â  Id. at\r\n  214-15, 656 S.E.2d at 372.Â  The State moved to vacate the defendant's sentence,\r\n  but did not do so within ten days of defendant's sentencing, or the completion\r\n  of his co-defendant's trial.Â  Id.Â  The plea judge allowed the motion,\r\n  and re-sentenced the defendant.Â  Id. at 215, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  On\r\n  appeal, the defendant/appellant maintained the plea judge lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear the State's motion outside of the ten days provided in\r\n  Rule 29, SCRCrimP.Â  Campbell, 376 S.C. at 215, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  \r\nThe supreme court discussed\r\n  Rule 29's temporal restriction within the more general rule that a trial judge\r\n  is without jurisdiction to consider a criminal matter once the term of court,\r\n  during which judgment was entered, expires.Â  Campbell, 376 S.C. at 215,\r\n  656 S.E.2d at 373; State v. Hinson, 303 S.C. 92, 399 S.E.2d 422 (1990).Â \r\n  While affirming that the ten day limitation is jurisdictional, and ultimately\r\n  reversing the plea judge's consideration of the State's motion outside of time,\r\n  the supreme court emphatically stated the rule did not involve subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Campbell, 376 S.C. at 216-17, 376 S.E.2d 373-74.Â  &quot;When\r\n  [the supreme court] used the 'lack of jurisdiction' language, [it] meant that\r\n  the trial court simply no longer has the power to act in a particular manner\r\n  because the term of court has ended.&quot;Â  Id. at 216, 376 S.E.2d at\r\n  373.Â  This, the court said, is more in line with the evolution of this state's\r\n  jurisprudence regarding jurisdiction since the Gentry decision.Â  Id. (citing Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe find the period\r\n  of time for motions for new trials prescribed in section 22-3-1000 is similar\r\n  to the ten day limit in Rule 29 and discussed in Campbell.Â  Consequently,\r\n  if the municipal court erred in entertaining Holtzclaw's motion to reopen his\r\n  case, this was an error of the municipal court's exercise of jurisdiction, and\r\n  does not implicate its general grant of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  &quot;[W]hen\r\n  there is jurisdiction of the person and subject matter, the decision of all\r\n  other questions arising in the case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Piana v. Piana, 239 S.C. 367, 372, 123 S.E.2d 297, 299 (1961) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\n\r\n  There\r\n    is a wide difference between want of jurisdiction in which case the court has\r\n    no power to adjudicate at all, and a mistake in the exercise of undoubted\r\n    jurisdiction in which case the action of the trial court is not void although\r\n    it may be subject to direct attack on appeal.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Jackson City Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.\r\n  Fredrick, 271 N.W. 908, 909 (Mich. 1935)).\r\nIndeed, DMV is\r\n  probably correct in its assertion the municipal court erred in hearing\r\n  Holtzclaw's motion to reopen; however, whereas a judgment entered without\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction is void, the improper exercise of jurisdiction by a\r\n  court, albeit decidedly wrong, is as binding as a proper exercise of\r\n  jurisdiction, is merely voidable, and must be attacked on direct appeal.Â  Id.; Matter of Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 372, 468 S.E.2d 651, 652 (1996).Â \r\n  Therefore, the proper recourse to challenge any alleged error in reopening\r\n  Holtzclaw's case should have been made in a direct appeal from the municipal\r\n  court's order.Â  Fryer v. S.C. Law Enforcement Div., 369 S.C. 395, 399,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 918, 920 (Ct. App. 2006); Coon v. Coon, 356 S.C. 342, 347-48,\r\n  588 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2003), aff'd as modified, 364 S.C. 563,\r\n  614 S.E.2d 616 (2005).\r\nDMV asserts this\r\n  case is similar to Town of Hilton Head Island v. Godwin, 370 S.C. 221,\r\n  634 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In Godwin, the defendant, Godwin, was\r\n  convicted of criminal domestic violence, and some eight years after the\r\n  conviction, made a motion to set aside the conviction and/or a motion for a new\r\n  trial in municipal court.Â  Id. at 223, 634 S.E.2d at 60.Â  The town\r\n  appeared and argued the municipal court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion\r\n  because it was untimely.Â  Id.Â  The court agreed, and denied Godwin's\r\n  motion; however on appeal, the circuit court agreed with Godwin, and granted a\r\n  new trial based on &quot;substantial justice.&quot;Â  Id.Â On appeal, this court vacated the\r\n    circuit court's grant of a new trial, finding &quot;the municipal court\r\n    correctly held Godwin's challenge to his conviction was untimely, and the\r\n    circuit court erred in failing to grant the Town's motion to dismiss for lack\r\n    of jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Id. at 225, 634 S.E.2d at 61.Â  \r\nDMV's argument that Godwin and the case before us are similar is compelling at first blush;\r\n  nevertheless, a crucial distinction between these two cases necessitates our\r\n  affirmance:Â  the appeal taken from the motion for a new trial in Godwin was a direct appeal from the municipal court, first by Godwin, then the Town; here,\r\n  no appeal was taken from the municipal court's order.Â  DMV correctly points out\r\n  that it was not a party to the underlying traffic violation or the motion to\r\n  reopen and that therefore, only the prosecuting body, which actually signed off\r\n  on the municipal court's motion to reopen at the time, would have been able to\r\n  appeal the decision.Â  We believe this is the proper policy to follow, as the\r\n  DMV appears to be a record keeping agency in this instance.Â  It is solely\r\n  within the court's province to decide the guilt or innocence on a particular\r\n  charge, before the result is reported to the DMV.\r\nAccordingly, the DMV's\r\n  position in this case is an improper collateral attack on the valid, even if improvidently\r\n  decided, order of the municipal court.Â  Moreover, because the third violation\r\n  conviction case was merely reopened, Holtzclaw could still be found guilty of\r\n  driving under a suspended license, at which time DMV could once again seek to\r\n  have Holtzclaw deemed a Habitual Offender. Â Because the municipal court's entertainment\r\n  of Holtzclaw's motion to reopen outside of the five day limitation in section\r\n  22-3-1000 did not involve subject matter jurisdiction, any error in its\r\n  resulting order was voidable, rather than void, and only subject to direct\r\n  appeal.Â  The dismissal by the ALC in this case is therefore \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and\r\nKONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Holtzclaw was convicted for Ticket 56318DN on\r\n  November 9, 2005; Ticket 57397DN on February 22, 2006; and Ticket 32881DE on\r\nMarch 16, 2006.Â  \r\n[2] Holtzclaw had previously appeared and pled guilty to\r\nTicket 32881DE.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4506","title":"Lee v.

Anderson was valid and not the result of undue influence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAnderson\r\n  passed away on January 29, 2002, at the age of ninety-eight.Â  Anderson's will\r\n  named her grandsons, Burney Locklear, III, and Edward Eugene Locklear\r\n  (collectively, the Locklears), as the sole beneficiaries, to the exclusion of\r\n  Anderson's daughter, Sara Anderson Lee.[1]Â \r\n  Lee is Anderson's last living child.Â  \r\nAnderson's\r\n  last living son, John, predeceased her on October 2, 2001.Â  John lived with\r\n  Anderson until his death and was unmarried.Â  Prior to and after John's death,\r\n  the Locklears resided at Anderson's home and assisted her with daily living,\r\n  including buying her groceries and paying her bills.Â  Anderson did not want to\r\n  go to a nursing home and the Locklears promised her they would take care of her\r\n  so she could stay in her home.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  October 2001, at Anderson's request, the Locklears and their cousin took\r\n  Anderson to a local attorney, James Epps, to prepare a power of attorney.[2]Â \r\n  Burney made the appointment and was present during the meeting between Anderson\r\n  and Epps.Â  At some point after the power of attorney naming the Locklears was\r\n  executed, a typographical error was discovered and Epps prepared a corrected\r\n  one.Â  \r\nAlso,\r\n  in October 2001, an adult abuse investigation was conducted as a result of an\r\n  anonymous phone call.Â  Diane Benjamin, a Department of Social Services (DSS) employee,\r\n  testified she went unannounced to Anderson's home on October 19, 2001, to\r\n  investigate an anonymous complaint of elderly abuse.Â  Benjamin determined Anderson\r\n  was well cared for by the Locklears and was mentally sharp, noting in her\r\n  report that Anderson was &quot;very alert to be a 98-year-old woman.&quot;Â \r\n  Anderson told Benjamin she wanted her grandson, Burney, to be in charge of her\r\n  affairs because she trusted him and she planned to meet with her attorney to\r\n  get a power of attorney for Burney.Â  She also said her son-in-law was trying to\r\n  force Burney to sign papers and take her out of her house.Â  Benjamin spoke with\r\n  Anderson privately while the Locklears were not in the room.Â  Benjamin made a\r\n  return visit on November 14, 2001, and Anderson remembered her from the first\r\n  visit.Â  Anderson told Benjamin she had resolved the family feud by giving a\r\n  power of attorney to Burney.\r\nIn\r\n  December 2001, Anderson decided to review her will with Epps.[3]Â \r\n  Anderson again directed Burney to make an appointment for her.Â  Epps informed\r\n  her that pursuant to her current will, executed in 1992, all of her property\r\n  was left to her son, John Anderson, and if he predeceased her, the property\r\n  went to her daughter, Betty Locklear.Â  Because both John and Betty had\r\n  predeceased Anderson, Epps told Anderson all her property would pass to Betty's\r\n  children, the Locklears.Â  Anderson explained to Epps that her other daughter,\r\n  Lee, was not in the will because she did not want Lee's &quot;husband to get\r\n  his hands on any of her property.&quot;Â  Anderson executed a second will on\r\n  December 20, 2001, naming the Locklears as the personal representatives and\r\n  beneficiaries because John and Betty had predeceased her.Â  Epps did not\r\n  consider the second will to be a substantive change because Anderson was simply\r\n  changing the names of her personal representatives as a result of the death of\r\n  the personal representatives named in her first will.Â  Two witnesses were present\r\n  at the signing of the will and Epps testified the Locklears did not have any\r\n  part in the discussion about the new will.Â  \r\nAaron\r\n  testified Anderson told him in December 2001 that the Locklears were trying to\r\n  get her to change her will and she wanted to keep her first will.Â  Aaron\r\n  testified he believed Anderson had been incompetent for twelve to fifteen years\r\n  and had been gradually getting worse.Â  In support of Lee's claims, Anderson's\r\n  treating physicians, Doctors Frank Lee and Joel Dekle, testified at trial as\r\n  experts.Â  Dr. Lee and Dr. Dekle both testified Anderson was mentally\r\n  incompetent.Â  Prior to trial, Aaron had contacted both doctors to write letters\r\n  about Anderson's mental state and gave them to Lee's attorney.Â  Dr. Lee\r\n  testified, in his opinion, Anderson started to suffer from senility in 1995;\r\n  however, his medical records for Anderson contained only two notations that she\r\n  was senile in the twenty-five to thirty years he treated her and he never\r\n  provided her with any medication for senility.Â  Dr. Dekle saw Anderson four\r\n  times and believed she had some senile dementia, but his medical records did\r\n  not have any notations about her senility.Â  Also, Dr. Dekle's letter stated\r\n  Anderson's condition went downhill after her son's death; however, he testified\r\n  this information was not from his personal knowledge, but was told to him from\r\n  someone else, possibly the Lees.Â  Gail Campbell, Anderson's granddaughter, also\r\n  testified she did not think Anderson was capable of understanding the will when\r\n  she signed it; however, at her deposition, she stated she probably only saw\r\n  Anderson once after John passed away.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, Alma Matthews, Anderson's sister-in-law, testified she visited with\r\n  Anderson once a week until she passed away and Anderson was mentally alert.Â  Other\r\n  family members, friends, and neighbors also testified Anderson was mentally\r\n  competent until she passed away.Â  Additionally, Anderson's life-long friend,\r\n  Mary Benton, testified Anderson told her she did not want Aaron to have any of\r\n  her property and she wanted the Locklears to get it.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 7, 2002, Burney instituted an informal probate of Anderson's will and\r\n  was appointed as the personal representative.Â  On March 4, 2002, Lee filed a\r\n  petition alleging Anderson's will was invalid because Anderson lacked the\r\n  requisite capacity to make a will and the will was the result of undue\r\n  influence.Â  Lee also filed a petition to be appointed as Anderson's personal\r\n  representative.Â  On March 16 and 17, 2006, the matter was tried without a\r\n  jury.Â  The probate court issued its order on April 27, 2006, finding there was\r\n  no undue influence and the will was valid.Â  Lee filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration with the probate court, which was denied, and Lee appealed to\r\n  the Court of Common Pleas.Â  After a hearing, the court issued its order\r\n  affirming the probate court.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\nAn action to set\r\n  aside a will is an action at law.Â  In re Estate of Cumbee, 333 S.C. 664,\r\n  670, 511 S.E.2d 390, 393 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;If the proceeding in the\r\n  probate court is in the nature of an action at law, the circuit court and this\r\n  Court may not disturb the probate judge's findings of fact unless a review of\r\n  the record discloses there is no evidence to support them.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;In a law case tried without a jury, questions regarding the credibility\r\n  and the weight of evidence are exclusively for the trial judge.&quot;Â  Golini\r\n    v. Bolton, 326 S.C. 333, 342, 482 S.E.2d 784, 789 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLee argues the probate court erred in finding Anderson's last\r\n  will and testament was valid and not the result of undue influence.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe maker's exercise\r\n  of judgment and free choice must be prevented to void a will on the ground of\r\n  undue influence.Â  Cumbee, 333 S.C. at 671, 511 S.E.2d at 394.Â  &quot;A mere\r\n  showing of opportunity or motive does not create an issue of fact regarding\r\n  undue influence.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;[T]he issue of undue influence should\r\n  be resolved in the light of the proposition that a sane testator has the right\r\n  to dispose of his property as he chooses.&quot;Â  Harris v. Berry, 231\r\n  S.C. 201, 205, 98 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1957) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;The mere\r\n  influence of affection and attachment, or the mere desire of gratifying the\r\n  wishes of another, will not vitiate a testamentary act unless that act was the\r\n  result of coercion or importunity beyond the testatorâ€™s power to resist.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  party seeking to challenge a will on the basis of undue influence must present\r\n  evidence which &quot;unmistakenly and convincingly shows the party's will was\r\n  overborne by the defendant or someone acting on his behalf.&quot;Â  Macaulay\r\n    v. Wachovia Bank of S.C., N.A., 351 S.C. 287, 299, 569 S.E.2d 371, 378 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;However, the existence of a confidential\r\n  relationship creates a presumption that the instrument is invalid, and the\r\n  burden then shifts to the proponent of the instrument to affirmatively show the\r\n  absence of undue influence.&quot;Â  Id. at 300, 569 S.E.2d at 378.Â \r\n  &quot;A confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a\r\n  special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good\r\n  conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interest\r\n  of the one imposing the confidence.&quot;Â  Cumbee, 333 S.C. at 672, 511\r\n  S.E.2d at 394 (quoting Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 422, 483 S.E.2d\r\n  477, 484 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  The presumption of invalidity in deed cases also\r\n  applies to will cases.Â  Howard v. Nasser, 364 S.C. 279, 287, 613 S.E.2d\r\n  64, 68 (Ct. App. 2005); see Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 398\r\n  n.7, 608 S.E.2d 849, 854 n.7 (2005) (&quot;[T]he analysis is the same\r\n  regardless of whether the underlying document sought to be set aside on the\r\n  grounds that the plaintiff was unduly influenced is a will or a deed.&quot;);\r\n  Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Wills and Other Donative Transfers Â§ 8.3 cmt. f (2003)\r\n  (&quot;A presumption of undue influence arises if the alleged wrongdoer was in\r\n  a confidential relationship with the donor . . . whether the transfer was by\r\n  gift, trust, will, will substitute, or a donative transfer of any other\r\n  types.&quot;).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLee\r\n  asserts the Locklears had a fiduciary relationship with Anderson by way of the\r\n  power of attorney and they placed undue influence on her to make a change to\r\n  her will.Â  Lee offers the following additional evidence in support of her claim\r\n  of undue influence: (1) the Locklears made the appointments with Epps for\r\n  Anderson; (2) the Locklears accompanied Anderson to the appointments; (3) the\r\n  Locklears were likely present during the discussion of the will; and (4) the\r\n  Locklears resided with and cared for Anderson in her home.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the Locklears had Anderson's power of attorney, which created a fiduciary\r\n  relationship, no evidence was presented it was ever utilized.Â  See Cumbee,\r\n  333 S.C. at 672-73, 511 S.E.2d at 394 (finding in a will contest that a fiduciary\r\n  relationship existed between son and mother when son had mother's power of\r\n  attorney and managed her finances, which created the presumption of undue\r\n  influence).Â  Burney testified he made the appointment with Epps at Anderson's\r\n  request and took Anderson to Epps' office because she needed help getting\r\n  there.Â  Epps, a practicing attorney, testified he did not witness any undue\r\n  influence and he believed the changes to the will were Anderson's ideas.Â  Epps\r\n  testified the Locklears did not have any part in the discussion about the new\r\n  will.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  in the 2001 will, Anderson changed the named personal representatives to the\r\n  Locklears because her son and daughter had predeceased her.Â  Also, Epps did not\r\n  think the 2001 will substantially changed anything because Anderson's 1992 will\r\n  also did not name Lee as a beneficiary and the Locklears were the sole beneficiaries\r\n  under that will as well.Â  Epps testified Anderson told him she did not want Lee\r\n  named as a beneficiary because she did not want Lee's &quot;husband to get his\r\n  hands on any of her property.&quot;Â  Anderson's life-long friend, Benton, also\r\n  testified Anderson told her she did not want Aaron to have any of her property\r\n  and she wanted the Locklears to inherit it. \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the Locklears did not force Anderson to stay in her home but were merely\r\n  following her wishes not to be sent to a nursing home.Â  Several witnesses\r\n  testified Anderson was the one giving the orders and was not likely to be\r\n  influenced by someone else.Â  Benjamin, the DSS Investigator, testified Anderson\r\n  told her she wanted Burney to be in charge of her affairs because she trusted\r\n  him and her son-in-law was trying to take her out of her house against her\r\n  wishes.Â  Also, Benjamin testified DSS encourages people to stay in their homes\r\n  if they have adequate care.Â  Dr. Lee also testified he had not recommended\r\n  Anderson be placed in a nursing home. \r\nThus,\r\n  the Locklears presented sufficient evidence to rebut a presumption of undue\r\n  influence.Â  Additionally, substantial evidence in the record supports the probate\r\n  court's finding the will was valid and not\r\n  the result of undue influence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the order of the probate court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\nC.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Betty Locklear was the Locklears' mother.Â  She was\r\n  one of Anderson's daughters and predeceased Anderson.\r\n[2]Â  Epps testified Lee's husband, Aaron, had previously\r\n  come to his office seeking a power of attorney for Anderson because she was\r\n  mentally incompetent; however, Epps told him Anderson could not give anyone a\r\n  power of attorney if she was mentally incompetent, and Lee responded she was\r\n  competent enough to give a power of attorney.Â  Aaron testified he did not\r\nremember going to Epps' office.\r\n[3]Â  Burney testified Aaron came over to Anderson's house\r\n  after John's death and was upset about Anderson's deceased husband's will.Â \r\n  After Aaron's visit, Burney said Anderson told him she wanted to see Epps and\r\ninstructed him to make the appointment.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4507","title":"State v.

Â The lengthy trial produced numerous witnesses\r\n  who testified to a drug-selling operation in which Trey Brown and Hill sold\r\n  drugs for a man named Mont Brown.Â  The victims were discovered shot in a liquor\r\n  house[1] frequented by all of the aforementioned parties.Â  \r\nWitnesses\r\n  observed Hill and Mont Brown having a serious private discussion at the liquor\r\n  house the day before the murders.Â  Witnesses also testified Trey Brown had a\r\n  confrontation with Mont Brown the night before the murder regarding the\r\n  division of profits from drugs Trey had sold.Â  \r\nAntone\r\n  Jones testified he sold drugs for Mont Brown and as a member of the\r\n  organization you were responsible for any other members you brought into the\r\n  business.Â  Jones stated Mont Brown had instructed him to kill his own cousin\r\n  when the cousin was arrested.Â  Jones testified Hill had brought Trey Brown into\r\n  the business.Â  \r\nThe mother of\r\n  Hill's child, Chasaity Drummond, testified she was at Hill's mother's house\r\n  picking up her child the morning after the murders.Â  Hill went inside, changed\r\n  his clothes, and asked Drummond to throw away a bag for him on her way out.Â \r\n  Hill cautioned Drummond she should not throw the bag away at her home.Â  \r\nMaxie\r\n  Wright, a former, long-time boyfriend of Hill's mother,[2] testified Hill told him Mont Brown had threatened to kill Hill's entire family\r\n  if Hill did not kill the victims.Â  Wright also testified Hill maintained his\r\n  innocence. \r\nThe\r\n  most damaging testimony against Hill was elicited from a police informant,\r\n  Timothy Paden.Â  Paden testified Hill had confessed to him while they were both\r\n  in the Greenville County Detention Center.Â  Paden further testified regarding a\r\n  recording he later made of Paden allegedly confessing to the crime.[3]Â \r\n  On cross-examination, Paden refused to answer questions regarding a plea\r\n  agreement he had made with federal authorities on an apparently unrelated drug\r\n  charge.Â  The federal authorities discovered Paden had provided false\r\n  information to them regarding a murder in an effort to have his sentence\r\n  reduced.Â  Paden told the federal authorities Mont Brown murdered another drug\r\n  dealer, Andre Rosemond, because Rosemond had kidnapped Mont Brown's wife and\r\n  child.Â  Paden failed a polygraph examination and confessed to fabricating this\r\n  story.Â  When his dishonesty was discovered, the federal judge sentenced Paden\r\n  to twenty years.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court determined the specific details of the violated plea agreement were\r\n  collateral to Hill's case thus, Hill's right to cross-examine Paden was not\r\n  impermissibly limited by Paden's invoking the Fifth Amendment on questions\r\n  relating to the failed agreement and Mont Brown.Â  Furthermore, the State\r\n  agreed, with some prodding from the trial court, to stipulate Paden had\r\n  previously provided false information to federal authorities in order to\r\n  receive a reduced sentence.Â  \r\nPaden\r\n  answered in the affirmative when asked if he had violated a plea agreement that\r\n  required his cooperation and his honesty.Â  Furthermore, upon cross-examination,\r\n  Paden admitted to having criminal convictions of his own and to reporting\r\n  crimes in exchange for the reward money available through the Crimestoppers\r\n  program.Â  At the conclusion of all testimony, Hill requested a jury instruction\r\n  that jurors may infer a witness's answer to a question would be adverse if that\r\n  witness invoked the Fifth Amendment.Â  The trial court refused the instruction.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  closing arguments, the State attempted to neutralize the defense's emphasis on\r\n  Mont Brown's role in the case by pointing out that Hill was the only person on\r\n  trial before this jury.Â  The solicitor stated &quot;the issue before you is not\r\n  the culpability of Demetrius Lamont Brown [Mont Brown].Â  The only issue before\r\n  you ladies and gentlemen, according to your oath, is whether this defendant,\r\n  Jomer Hill, is guilty of the murders of Trey Brown and Ken Goldsmith.&quot;Â  The\r\n  solicitor later stated &quot;[w]hy isn't anybody else in here with him?Â  Number\r\n  one, he's the only person that's within your province to consider.&quot;Â  The\r\n  defense then objected and the discussion relating to the objection was later\r\n  placed on the record arguing the last statement by the solicitor commented on\r\n  Hill's failure to put up a defense and call witnesses.Â  The court took the\r\n  defense's argument and motion for mistrial under advisement and later\r\n  determined the comment was meant to focus the jury on the question of Hill's\r\n  innocence or guilt as opposed to Mont Brown's culpability and did not, in context,\r\n  unfairly comment on Hill's right not to testify.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Paden's Testimony \r\nHill argues the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting Paden's testimony regarding the victims' murders\r\n  and permitting Paden to refuse to answer certain questions on\r\n  cross-examination.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe right of a defendant in a federal\r\n  court to confront the witnesses against him, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment,\r\n  includes the right to test the truth of those witnesses' testimony by\r\n  cross-examination.Â  U.S. v. Cardillo, 316 F.2d 606, 610 (2nd Cir. 1963).Â  This right is also guaranteed by our\r\n  State constitution.Â  See State v. Nest Egg Soc. Today, Inc., 290\r\n  S.C. 124, 130, 348 S.E.2d 381, 385 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\n\r\n  The importance of cross-examination in our jurisprudence has been\r\n    well stated by Professor Wigmore: &quot;It is beyond any doubt the greatest\r\n    legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth. However difficult it may\r\n    be for the layman, the scientist, or the foreign jurist to appreciate this, its\r\n    wonderful power, there has probably never been a moment's\r\n    doubt upon this in the mind of a lawyer of experience.&quot; \r\n\r\nCardillo, 316 F.2d at 610-11 (quoting 5 Wigmore,\r\n  Evidence Â§ 1367 (3d ed. 1940)).Â  Nevertheless, &quot;[t]he trial court retains\r\n  discretion to 'impose reasonable limits on [the scope] of cross-examination designed\r\n  to show the prototypical form of bias on the part of a witness.' &quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385-86, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  seminal case on this issue is Cardillo, 316 F.2d at 610.Â  In Cardillo, the court discussed the scenarios that could occur when a\r\n  witness is presented to testify against a defendant and allowed to plead the\r\n  Fifth Amendment on cross-examination.Â  \r\n\r\n  Where the privilege has been invoked as to purely collateral\r\n    matters, there is little danger of prejudice to the defendant and, therefore,\r\n    the witness's testimony may be used against him.Â  On the other hand, if the\r\n    witness by invoking the privilege precludes inquiry into the details of his\r\n    direct testimony, there may be a substantial danger of prejudice because the\r\n    defense is deprived of the right to test the truth of his direct testimony and,\r\n    therefore, that witness's testimony should be stricken in whole or in part.\r\n\r\nId. at 611.Â  Questions on cross-examination\r\n  are collateral if they relate solely to the witness's credibility and bear no\r\n  relation to the subject matter of the direct examination.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn direct examination, Paden testified primarily to the contents of\r\n  his taped conversation with Hill in which Hill answered &quot;yeah&quot; to the\r\n  question of whether he was alone when he shot Trey and Ken.Â  Paden testified\r\n  about the events surrounding the making of that tape, and he testified about\r\n  his past police informant activities and rewards he had received through the Crimestoppers\r\n  program.Â  The State questioned Paden regarding his current incarceration on\r\n  drug charges and the violated plea agreement.\r\n\r\n  Q. Last question, Mr. Paden. . . . First of all,\r\n    did you enter into some kind of an agreement with the Federal Government?\r\n  A. Yes, sir.\r\n  Q. And was it the position of the Federal\r\n    Government that you violated the terms of that agreement, with particularity\r\n    toward your honesty?\r\n  A. Yes, sir, but due to my appeal I'm not even\r\n    allowed to discuss it, sir.Â  \r\n\r\nFrom\r\n  the record, it appears Hill sought to elicit more details from Paden regarding\r\n  the specifics of his dishonesty in his federal deal.[4]Â \r\n  However, under Cardillo such information is collateral to Paden's direct\r\n  testimony in the case sub judice.Â  The specifics of the failed plea\r\n  agreement bear on Paden's credibility.Â  Nothing in the record suggests any of\r\n  the proposed questions Paden failed to answer would have related to his direct\r\n  testimony.Â  Paden's credibility issues were put before the jury through direct\r\n  and cross-examination.Â  Consequently, Paden's refusal to address collateral\r\n  matters did not prejudice Hill, and the admission of Paden's direct testimony\r\n  was proper. \r\nII. Jury\r\n  Instruction\r\nHill contends the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  give the requested jury charge that &quot;if [a] witness takes [the] fifth or\r\n  refuses to testify you the jury may infer that the answer would be adverse.&quot;Â \r\n  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  the trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South\r\n  Carolina.&quot;Â  State v. Ziegler, 364 S.C. 94, 106, 610 S.E.2d 859, 865\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If a charge is substantially correct and covers the law there\r\n  is no need for reversal.Â  Id.Â Â  To warrant reversal, the refusal to give\r\n  a requested charge must be erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  Id.\r\nIn the instant case, Hill submitted his request with no supporting\r\n  authority, and we are unable to find any that supports the giving of this\r\n  charge.Â  In fact, &quot;[i]t is desirable the jury not know that a witness has invoked the\r\n  privilege against self-incrimination since neither party is entitled to draw\r\n  any inference from such invocation.&quot;Â  State v. Hughes, 328 S.C. 146, 150, 493 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1997)\r\n  (discussing instances in which a witness is presented solely for the purpose of\r\n  invoking the Fifth Amendment in front of the jury and referencing &quot;general\r\n  rule that no adverse inference may be drawn from witnessâ€™ assertion of the\r\n  privilege&quot;). \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the given jury charge was substantially correct and covered the applicable\r\n  law.Â  The trial court instructed &quot;[y]ou may also consider the appearance,\r\n  the manner of the witness while on the stand.Â  Was he or she straightforward or\r\n  hesitant in answering?&quot; and whether &quot;there was some reason a witness\r\n  would want to give testimony which would help or hurt one side or the\r\n  other.&quot;Â  These instructions informed the jury that it is the judge of\r\n  credibility and it could consider Paden's hesitancy in responding to questions\r\n  on cross-examination.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not err in\r\n  refusing to give the requested charge, and Hill was not prejudiced thereby.\r\nIII. Solicitor's\r\n  Closing Remarks\r\nFinally,\r\n  Hill contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial because\r\n  the solicitor improperly commented on Hill's right to remain silent and not\r\n  present a defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court has\r\n  discretion to grant or deny a motion for mistrial, and the court's decision\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an\r\n  error of law.Â  State v. Culbreath, 377 S.C. 326, 331, 659 S.E.2d 268,\r\n  271 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  A mistrial should be granted only when absolutely\r\n  necessary.Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514\r\n  (1999).Â  To receive a mistrial, a defendant must show both error and resulting\r\n  prejudice.Â  Id. \r\n&quot;[I]t is impermissible for the State to comment directly or\r\n  indirectly upon a defendant's failure to testify at trial.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 319, 577 S.E.2d 460, 464 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  &quot;However,\r\n  even improper comments on a defendant's failure to testify do not automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the\r\n  defendant.&quot;Â  Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 221, 552 S.E.2d 26, 33 (2001).Â Â \r\n  The defendant must show the improper comment deprived him of a fair trial.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Additionally, a curative instruction emphasizing the jury cannot consider the\r\n  defendant's failure to testify will cure any potential error. Â Id.\r\nWhen\r\n  examined in context, we do not believe the solicitor's comment unfairly\r\n  commented on Hill's right to remain silent.Â  As seen throughout the record,\r\n  part of the defense strategy was to place direct or indirect responsibility for\r\n  the murders on Mont Brown.Â  Therefore, the solicitor emphasized that only Hill\r\n  was on trial and before the jury, and its task was to determine whether or not\r\n  he alone was guilty.Â  Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jury the\r\n  defendant's silence could not be considered &quot;in any manner\r\n  whatsoever&quot; and the defendant has no burden of proof and is not required\r\n  to prove his innocence.Â  Therefore, even if the solicitor's comment was\r\n  improper, the trial court's jury instruction should be deemed to have cured any\r\n  error or prejudice that may have resulted from it.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The liquor\r\n  house was a house located at 18 Chestnut Street in Greenville where visitors\r\n  gambled, drank, sold drugs, socialized, played video games, and watched\r\ntelevision.\r\n[2] The woman is\r\n  actually his grandmother, but she raised Hill and their relationship was that\r\nof mother and son.\r\n[3] The record\r\n  contains a transcript of the tape prepared by the State and provided to the\r\n  jury to aid in their understanding of the recording.Â  In the transcript, Hill\r\n  purportedly answers in the affirmative several times when Paden asks if Hill\r\nwas alone when he shot Trey and Ken.\r\n[4] Hill argued\r\n  Paden was &quot;dodging&quot; him about lying about another murder case by &quot;hiding\r\n  behind the Fifth Amendment.&quot;Â  Hill further contended Paden is &quot;sitting\r\n  here trying to put my client's feet in the fire and yet he wants to dodge being\r\ncross-examined about his prior â€“ his prior lies . . . .&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4508","title":"AJG Holdings, LLC v.

Scoville, Jr., of Georgetown, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  Levon Dunn\r\n  and Pamela Dunn (the Dunns) appeal the trial court's imposition of a\r\n  preliminary injunction barring any commercial use of their property.Â  We affirm\r\nin part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  Dunns own approximately thirteen acres of contiguous land in Georgetown County.Â  Four of the thirteen acres are located within a subdivision developed by\r\n  Helen Sasser and known as Woodland Plantation.Â  The four acres are divided into\r\n  four lots, numbered Lots 7, 8, 9, and 10.Â  Lots 9 and 10 were previously\r\n  conveyed to the Dunns on September 9, 1994, by Riverside, Inc.Â  The Dunns\r\n  purchased Lots 7 and 8 on January 20, 2003, from Rodney and Carolyn Causey.Â \r\n  The deeds for the Dunns' lots contain covenants and restrictions placed on the\r\n  land by Sasser.Â  The restrictions prohibit, among other things, commercial use\r\n  of the lots without Sasser's written consent.Â  The Dunns claim they were\r\n  unaware of the restrictions when they decided to renovate a house located on\r\n  Lots 7 and 8 to be used as a bed and breakfast facility and for social events including\r\n  weddings and receptions.Â  Georgetown County approved the renovations to the\r\n  property.Â  After the renovations were completed, the Dunns advertised the\r\nproperty in various publications and on a website as Dunn Acres Plantation.[1]\r\nShortly\r\n  after the Dunns began advertising the plantation, the Dunns received a letter\r\n  from a neighbor, Tommy Abbott, stating he learned of their plans to use the\r\n  property as a bed and breakfast and he objected to any commercial activity on\r\n  the property.Â  Abbott also informed the Dunns the deed restrictions prohibited\r\n  any commercial activity.Â  As a result of Abbott's letter, the Dunns contacted\r\n  Sasser to request an assignment and release of Sasser's rights as developer to\r\n  the Dunns.Â  The Dunns paid Sasser $15,000 for the assignment, which was\r\nexecuted on September 6, 2006.\r\nOn\r\n  August 18, 2006, AJG Holdings, LLC; Stalvey Holdings, LLC; David Croyle; Linda\r\n  Croyle; Jean Abbott; Lynda Courtney; Sumter Langston; Diane Langston; Carl\r\n  Singleton, Jr.; Virginia Owens; and Stoney Harrelson (collectively, Respondents),\r\n  who are owners of property in Woodland Plantation, filed an action seeking an\r\n  injunction against the Dunns to prevent any commercial activity on their\r\n  property, which Respondents claimed violated their deed restrictions.Â  On\r\n  February 26, 2007, Respondents filed an amended complaint and motion for a\r\n  temporary restraining order.[2]Â \r\n  Respondents asserted causes of action against the Dunns for violation of\r\n  restrictive covenants, nuisance, and civil conspiracy.Â  The amended complaint\r\n  also added Sasser as a party-defendant and asserted causes of action against\r\n  her for slander of title, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of warranties,\r\nbreach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and civil conspiracy.\r\nThe\r\n  Dunns asserted counterclaims against Respondents for tortuous interference with\r\n  prospective business relations, interference with a contractual relationship,\r\n  civil conspiracy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  On May 16,\r\n  2007, after a hearing on Respondents' motion for a temporary restraining order,\r\n  the trial court imposed a temporary injunction against the Dunns.Â  The Dunns\r\n  filed a motion for reconsideration, to amend the court's findings, and to alter\r\nor amend the court's judgment pursuant to Rules 52(b) and 59(e), SCRCP, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n&quot;An action to\r\n  enforce restrictive covenants by injunctions is in equity.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d\r\n  299, 302 (2001).Â  The grant of an injunction is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  City\r\n    of Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., 340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518,\r\n  520-21 (2000); Peek v. Spartanburg Reg'l Healthcare Sys., 367 S.C. 450,\r\n  454, 626 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the decision of the trial court is unsupported by the evidence or\r\n  controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Peek, 367 S.C. at 454, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  at 36; County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d\r\n902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI.Â  Bond\r\nThe\r\n  Dunns argue the trial court improperly failed to require Respondents to post a\r\nbond before imposing the preliminary injunction.Â  We agree.\r\nRule\r\n65(c), SCRCP, provides that:\r\n\r\n  Except\r\n    in divorce, child custody and non-support actions where the giving of security\r\n    is discretionary, no restraining order or temporary injunction shall issue\r\n    except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court\r\n    deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or\r\n    suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or\r\n    restrained.\r\n\r\nRecently,\r\n  in Atwood Agency v. Black, 374 S.C. 68, 73, 646 S.E.2d 882, 884 (2007),\r\n  our supreme court held even a nominal bond does not satisfy Rule 65(c).Â  The\r\n  court found the nominal amount was improper &quot;because it erroneously\r\n  assume[d] the injunction [was] proper instead of providing an amount sufficient\r\n  to protect appellants in the event the injunction [was] ultimately deemed\r\n  improper.&quot;Â  Id. at 73, 646 S.E.2d at 884.Â  The court remanded the\r\n  case to the trial court to award the appropriate amount of costs and damages\r\n  incurred as a result of the temporary injunction.Â  See also 12 S.C. Jur. Equity Â§ 19 (1992) (&quot;Rule 65(c) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure requires that security be posted before the court may issue . .\r\n. a temporary injunction.&quot;). \r\nPrior\r\n  to the adoption of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, our supreme\r\n  court held a bond was required for the issuance of a temporary injunction under\r\n  section 570 of the 1942 South Carolina Code; however, a court's failure to\r\n  require a bond was not a jurisdictional defect, and a court could amend the\r\n  order of injunction to require execution of a sufficient bond.Â  Epps v.\r\n    Bryant, 218 S.C. 359, 365, 62 S.E.2d 832, 834-35 (1950); Ex Parte\r\n      Zeigler, 83 S.C. 78, 81, 64 S.E. 513, 514 (1909) (holding the injunction\r\n  was correctly granted, but the court erred in not requiring a bond and, thus,\r\n  the circuit court's judgment was modified to require the filing of a proper\r\nbond).\r\nAlthough we\r\n  recognize the Dunns stated they were not using their property for commercial\r\n  purposes, and therefore, it follows there would be no need for a bond to\r\n  protect their future losses as a result of the injunction, Respondents also\r\n  filed affidavits claiming nuisance and noise as a result of weddings previously\r\n  held on the Dunns' property.Â  Thus, it appears at some point the Dunns'\r\n  property may have been used for commercial purposes.Â  Therefore, because Rule\r\n  65(c), SCRCP, requires the trial court to order Respondents to post a bond\r\n  before issuing the temporary injunction, and no bond was ordered in this case,\r\n  we remand this case for the trial court to amend the order of injunction to\r\nrequire execution of a sufficient bond.[3]Â \r\nII.Â \r\nElements Required for Temporary Injunction\r\nThe\r\n  Dunns argue the trial court improperly imposed the preliminary injunction\r\n  because the court failed to require Respondents to meet all of the mandatory\r\nelements to obtain a preliminary injunction.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;An\r\n  injunction is a drastic remedy issued by the court in its discretion to prevent\r\n  irreparable harm suffered by the plaintiff.&quot;Â  Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes\r\n    W. Residential Golf Props., Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 121, 603 S.E.2d 905, 907 (2004).Â \r\n  The plaintiff's complaint must allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of\r\n  action for injunction and demonstrate it is reasonably necessary to protect the\r\n  legal rights of the plaintiff pending in the action.Â  Peek v. Spartanburg Reg'l Healthcare Sys., 367 S.C. 450, 454, 626 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct. App. 2005); County of\r\n    Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664,\r\n  669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  Generally, for a preliminary injunction to be granted, the plaintiff must\r\n  establish that: (1) he would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not\r\n  granted; (2) he will likely succeed on the merits of the litigation; and (3)\r\n  there is an inadequate remedy at law.Â  Scratch Golf Co., 361 S.C. at\r\n  121, 603 S.E.2d at 908; Peek, 367 S.C. at 454-55, 626 S.E.2d at 36.Â  &quot;Before\r\n  granting an injunction, the trial court should balance the equities: the court\r\n  should look at the particular facts of each case and the equities of each party\r\n  and determine which side, if any, is more entitled to equitable relief.&quot;Â  Peek,\r\n  367 S.C. at 455, 626 S.E.2d at 36-37.Â  The purpose of an injunction is to\r\n  preserve the status quo and prevent possible irreparable injury to a party\r\npending litigation.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  plaintiff is not required to prove an absolute legal right when seeking a\r\n  preliminary injunction, but the plaintiff must present a reasonable question as\r\n  to the existence of such a right.Â  Id. at 456, 626 S.E.2d at 37.Â  &quot;When\r\n  a court is requested to issue a temporary injunction it may consider the merits\r\n  of a case to the extent necessary to determine whether a temporary injunction\r\n  is appropriate.&quot;Â  Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32,\r\n  413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992).Â  &quot;Once a prima facie showing has been made\r\n  entitling the plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be\r\n  granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Generally, a restrictive covenant will be enforced regardless\r\n  of the amount of damage that will result from the breach and even though there\r\n  is no substantial monetary damage to the complainant by reason of the\r\n  violation. . . . The mere breach alone is grounds for injunctive relief.&quot;Â  Siau v. Kassel, 369 S.C. 631, 640-41, 632 S.E.2d 888, 893 (Ct. App.\r\n2006). \r\nThe\r\n  Dunns argue Respondents failed to meet the three mandatory elements to obtain a\r\n  preliminary injunction.Â  First, the Dunns claim Respondents did not show they\r\n  would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted, but would merely\r\n  suffer some inconvenience from their commercial activity.Â  However, Respondents\r\n  submitted affidavits stating the commercial activity on the Dunns' land caused\r\n  noise and traffic in the neighborhood.Â  This activity interfered with their\r\n  right to the use and enjoyment of their property and is sufficient to prove Respondents\r\n  suffered an irreparable harm.Â  Second, the Dunns argue Respondents did not\r\n  present sufficient evidence they will likely succeed on the merits of the\r\n  litigation because the restrictions were eliminated by the Sasser assignment.Â  Respondents\r\n  presented affidavits and deeds in support of their argument that Sasser did not\r\n  hold any such right or reservation, thus the assignment was invalid, and the\r\n  Dunns' property remains subject to the prohibition against commercial uses.Â  This\r\n  is sufficient evidence to show Respondents are likely to succeed on the merits.\r\n  Â Third, the Dunns claim Respondents have an adequate remedy at law because they\r\n  could contact local law enforcement about the noise and disruptive guests, or\r\n  they could sue for monetary damages.Â  The trial judge found the Dunns' criminal\r\n  law resolutions and an award of monetary damages to be inadequate remedies for\r\n  the intrusions on Respondents' property rights.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial\r\n  judge properly found Respondents made a prima facie showing they were entitled\r\n  to injunctive relief and, therefore, the temporary injunction was properly\r\ngranted.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Dunns claim the court erred by basing its decision on their statements\r\n  concerning the use of their land.Â  Levon\r\n  Dunn stated in his affidavit they &quot;have not conducted any commercial\r\n  activity on Lots 7-10 at any time before or since we learned of the\r\n  restrictions prohibiting such use.&quot;Â  (emphasis in original).Â  Also, the\r\n  Dunns' attorney stated twice during the hearing that there was no commercial\r\n  activity taking place on the property.Â  The trial court found these statements significant\r\n  and noted them in the order because it is evidence the injunction will not be\r\nunduly inequitable against the Dunns.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, we affirm the circuit court's order granting the\r\n  temporary injunction; however, we reverse the circuit court's order failing to require Respondents to post a\r\nbond, and remand for findings in accordance with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nCURETON\r\n  and GOOLSBY, A.JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In his affidavit dated February 1, 2007, Levon Dunn\r\n  stated they &quot;have not conducted any commercial activity on Lots 7-10 at\r\n    any time before or since we learned of the restrictions prohibiting such\r\n  use.&quot;Â  (Emphasis in original).Â  Also, the Dunns' attorney stated twice\r\n  during the hearing that there was no commercial activity taking place on the\r\nproperty.\r\n[2] Respondents also filed affidavits from neighbors David\r\n  Croyle, Lynda Courtney, and Tommy Abbott that state the commercial use of the\r\n  Dunns' property is disruptive to the neighborhood by causing traffic and noise,\r\n  and impairs the enjoyment of their property.Â  In response, the Dunns filed an\r\n  affidavit from Reecy Whipple, who owns the house closest to the Dunns'\r\n  property.Â  Whipple averred he was present at his home during three weddings at\r\n  the Dunns' property, and the music was not loud, the guests were gone in three\r\nhours, and the traffic was reasonable.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[3] Moreover, we note Rule 65(c) provides security for\r\n  the payment of court and other costs incurred by the Dunns should the court\r\nultimately find they were wrongfully enjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4509","title":"American Legion v.

Young, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Horry County appeals the circuit court's order\r\n  requiring the County to refund admissions fees remitted by American Legion Post\r\n  15, American Legion Post 17, and Steve Johnson.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nAmerican\r\n  Legion Post 15 and American Legion Post 17 (the Posts) are non-profit\r\n  tax-exempt corporations.Â  Johnson is employed by the Posts as the administrator\r\n  of the Posts' bingo games.Â  In 1996, the South Carolina Legislature enacted the\r\n  Bingo Tax Act of 1996 (the Act).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-21-3910 to -4300 (2000\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  The Act governs the entrance fees and sale of bingo cards.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-4030 (2000). Â \r\nThe Act\r\n  imposes a tax upon paid admissions to &quot;places of amusement&quot; within\r\n  South Carolina.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2420 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  However,\r\n  section 12-21-4270 of the Act provides: &quot;Each\r\n  licensed nonprofit organization or promoter, in the name of a licensed\r\n  organization, may obtain bingo cards . . . . The sale of\r\n    bingo cards and entrance fees provided by Section 12-21-4030 are not\r\n      subject to the admissions tax provided by Section 12-21-2420.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-4270 (Supp. 2008)\r\n  (emphasis added). \r\nIn\r\n  1996, the Horry County Council adopted the Horry County Hospitality Fee\r\n  Ordinance, which similarly imposed a service charge upon entrance fees paid at\r\n  places of amusement within the County.Â  See Horry County, S.C.,\r\n  Ordinances 105-96, Â§19-6(a)(2) (1996).Â  This section applies to places of\r\n  amusement that the admissions tax imposed by section 12-21-2420 applies under\r\n  the South Carolina Code.Â  Id.Â  The Ordinance further mandates the\r\n  payment of the fee &quot;shall be the liability of the consumer&quot; and &quot;shall\r\n  be collected by the provider of the services. . . .&quot;Â Â  Id. at\r\n  Â§19-6(b).Â  The County required the Posts to remit payments effective January 1,\r\n  1997, with the first remittances due to the County by February 20, 1997. \r\nJohnson's\r\n  daughter, Christie Johnson Brunson, operates the bingo operations for the Posts.Â \r\n  Brunson testified the Posts collected the admissions charges pursuant to state\r\n  law for each person who entered to play bingo.[1]Â \r\n  Brunson testified the County notified her the Posts would be charged the\r\n  hospitality fee.Â  She began forwarding the fees to the County but did not\r\n  collect the fees from the bingo customers, instead remitting the amount from\r\n  the Posts' proceeds.Â  Between 1997 and 2001, the Posts paid $34,523.94 to the\r\n  County as admissions fees.Â  Brunson believed the fee should not be charged for bingo;\r\n  therefore, she paid several of the Posts' first remittances &quot;under protest.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  November of 2001, the County contacted Brunson and told her to cease remitting\r\n  the County hospitality fee because the ordinance did not apply to the Posts'\r\n  bingo establishments.Â  As reflected in the County's file, Brunson asked for a\r\n  refund on January 10, 2002.Â  Brunson testified she was told by Roddy Dickerson,\r\n  the Assistant County Treasurer,[2] that he would look into the possibility of refunding the payments.Â  Dickerson\r\n  advised Brunson to seek a refund by letter to the County.Â  By undated letter,\r\n  Brunson requested the refund.Â  Brunson testified this letter was sent in\r\n  January of 2002.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, Brunson received an interoffice memo from the Horry County Attorney\r\n  to Dickerson dated November 3, 2003.[3]Â \r\n  The memo noted that Horry County charged hospitality fees on bingo between 1997\r\n  and 2001, but in 2001 determined it was inappropriate to charge the hospitality\r\n  fees, and in March of 2003 the County was requested to refund the Posts'\r\n  payments.Â  The County Attorney counseled that the Posts may be barred from a\r\n  refund in part or full by the application of the statute of limitations.Â  The County\r\n  Attorney concluded any refund would be improper regardless of the statute of\r\n  limitations because the right to a refund of erroneously collected taxes is\r\n  restricted to those upon whom the tax liability is imposed. \r\nIn\r\n  October of 2004, the Posts and Johnson filed this action.Â  The County answered,\r\n  raising, inter alia, the statute of limitations and standing.Â  After a\r\n  hearing, the trial court ordered the County to refund the amount remitted by\r\n  the Posts and denied the County's motion for reconsideration.Â  The County\r\n  appealed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to recover a tax erroneously paid is an action at law\r\n  but equitable in its function.Â  Stone v. White, 301 U.S. 532, 534 (1937).Â  Such an action is governed by the equitable principles that underlie an\r\n  action to avoid unjust enrichment.Â  Id.; see Hollingsworth on\r\n    Wheels, Inc. v. Greenville County Treasurer, 276 S.C. 314, 317, 278 S.E.2d\r\n  340, 342 (1981) (applying standard of review of action in equity to action for\r\n  refund of property taxes). In applying equity, this court can find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Felts v.\r\n    Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe County argues the Posts lack standing to seek a\r\n  refund and the Posts' action is barred by a three-year statute of limitations.\r\nA.&nbsp; Standing \r\nRelying\r\n  on Furman University v. Livingston, 244 S.C. 200, 136 S.E.2d 254 (1964),\r\n  the County argues the Posts lacked standing to seek a refund because they were\r\n  not the parties responsible for the payment of the hospitality fees.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nIn Furman,\r\n  the University collected admission taxes from ticket-purchasers to athletic\r\n  events and remitted them to the State under protest.Â  Id. at 201, 136\r\n  S.E.2d at 254-55.Â  The University filed an action alleging its athletic events\r\n  were exempt from the admission tax statute and seeking recovery of the taxes\r\n  remitted.Â  Id. at 202, 136 S.E.d at 255.Â  Our Supreme Court found the\r\n  right to sue for erroneously paid taxes is restricted to those on whom the tax\r\n  liability is imposed.Â  Id. at 204, 136 S.E.2d at 256.Â  &quot;A\r\n  withholding or collection agent who has reimbursed himself by withholding or\r\n  collecting the amount of the taxes from a third person is not entitled to a\r\n  refund of such taxes.Â  In such case, the right to a refund is in the 'taxpayer'\r\n  from whom the funds were withheld or collected.&quot;Â  Id. Â The court\r\n  concluded the University was not the taxpayer under the facts of that case and\r\n  therefore had no standing to seek a refund. Â Id. at 205, 136 S.E.2d at\r\n  256-57.Â  \r\nLike\r\n  the trial court, we find we find Furman is distinguishable.Â  Although\r\n  section 19-6 provides the admissions fee is the liability of the consumer, the\r\n  only evidence in the record is that the Posts paid the fees rather than\r\n  collecting them from the consumers and was therefore the &quot;taxpayer&quot;\r\n  under Furman.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's finding the\r\n  Posts had standing to seek a refund. \r\nB.&nbsp; Statute\r\n  of Limitations \r\nThe\r\n  County next argues the Posts' action is barred by a three-year statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  We agree. \r\nSection\r\n  12-54-85(F)(1) of the South Carolina Code provides: &quot;claims for credit or\r\n  refund must be filed within three years from the time the return was filed, or\r\n  two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-54-85(F)(1) (Supp. 2008). Â Â The statute further states: &quot;A\r\n  credit or refund may not be made after the expiration of the period of\r\n  limitation . . . unless the claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer\r\n  or determined to be due by the department within that period.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\tSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Section 12-60-2150(G) provides:Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tEven if a taxpayer has not filed a claim for refund, where no\r\n  question of fact or law is involved, and it appears from the record that money\r\n  has been erroneously or illegally collected from a taxpayer or other person\r\n  under a mistake of fact or law, the department may . . . , within the period\r\n  specified in Section 12-54-85 and upon making a record in writing of its\r\n  reasons, order a refund to the taxpayer or other person.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at Â§\r\n  12-60-2150(G) (2000).Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  its first order, the trial court found Brunson's letter requesting the refund\r\n  was an appeal of the imposition of the tax and tolled any statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  In its subsequent order denying the County's motion for\r\n  reconsideration, the court found the County was estopped from raising the\r\n  statute of limitations as a defense.Â  The court found the County's conduct\r\n  induced the Posts into believing a lawsuit was unnecessary.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Equitable Tolling\r\nThe County argues\r\n  the court erred in finding Brunson's letter tolled the statute of limitations.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\n&quot;South\r\n  Carolina has rarely applied the doctrine of equitable tolling\r\n  to halt the running of the statute of limitations.\r\n  Â Equitable tolling is reserved for extraordinary\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr.,\r\n  377 S.C. 217, 230, 659 S.E.2d 213, 219 (Ct. App. 2008), cert. granted, (Nov.\r\n  20, 2008).Â  The court in Hooper stated:\r\n\r\n\tThe time requirements in lawsuits between private\r\n  litigants are customarily subject to equitable tolling if such tolling is\r\n  necessary to prevent unfairness to a diligent plaintiff. Â However, equitable\r\n  tolling, which allows a plaintiff to initiate an action beyond the statute of\r\n  limitations deadline, is typically available only if the claimant was prevented\r\n  in some extraordinary way from exercising his or her rights, or, in other\r\n  words, if the relevant facts present sufficiently rare and exceptional circumstances that would warrant\r\n  application of the doctrine.\r\n\tEquitable tolling has been deemed available where â€“ \r\n\tâ€“ extraordinary circumstances prevented the plaintiff\r\n  from filing despite his or her diligence.\r\n\tâ€“ the plaintiff actively pursued his or her judicial\r\n  remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period or the\r\n  claimant has been induced or tricked by the defendant's misconduct into\r\n  allowing the filing deadline to pass.\r\n\tâ€“ the plaintiff, despite all due diligence, is unable\r\n  to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of his or her claim.\r\n\tIt has\r\n  been held that equitable tolling applies principally if the plaintiff is\r\n  actively misled by the defendant about the cause of action or is prevented in\r\n  some extraordinary way from asserting his or her rights. Â However, it has also\r\n  been held that the equitable tolling doctrine does not require wrongful conduct\r\n  on the part of the defendant, such as fraud or misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nId. at 231-32, 659\r\n  S.E.2d at 220-21, quoting 51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitation of Actions Â§ 174\r\n  (2007). Â In this case, we find no extraordinary circumstances or active\r\n  misleading by the County to warrant tolling the statutory period of limitations.Â \r\n  Nothing prevented the Posts from learning of the governing statutes, as we find\r\n  is required for due diligence.Â  See Snell v. Columbia Gun Exch., Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981) (defining reasonable diligence as\r\n  requiring an injured party to act with promptness where circumstances of an\r\n  injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that\r\n  some claim may exist).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in finding Brunson's\r\n  letter tolled the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Estoppel\r\nLastly,\r\n  the County argues the trial court erred in finding the County was estopped from\r\n  raising the statute of limitations.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  defendant may be estopped from claiming the statute of limitations as a defense\r\n  if delay in bringing the action was induced by the defendant's conduct.Â  Wiggins\r\n    v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 130, 442 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1994).Â  The defendant's\r\n  conduct may consist of an express representation or conduct suggesting a\r\n  lawsuit is not necessary.Â  Id. Â Estoppel may apply against a government agency\r\n  and the party asserting estoppel against the government must prove: (1) lack of\r\n  knowledge\r\n  and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2)\r\n  justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct; and (3) a\r\n  prejudicial change in position.Â  Morgan\r\n    v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 377\r\n  S.C. 313, 320, 659 S.E.2d 263, 267&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).Â  Citizens are presumed\r\n  to know the law and are charged with exercising reasonable care to protect\r\n  their interests.Â  Id. Â Estoppel will not lie against a governmental\r\n  entity when a government employee gives erroneous information in contradiction\r\n  of statute. Â Id. at 319, 659 S.E.2d at 267. Â &quot;Simply stated, equity\r\n  follows the law.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nWe\r\n  find the Posts do not meet the elements necessary to estop the County from\r\n  raising the statute of limitations.Â  The Posts are presumed to know the law and\r\n  may not rely on contrary conduct by the County in contradiction of a statute.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in finding the County estopped from\r\n  relying on the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the trial court's finding on the issue of standing.Â  We reverse the\r\n  trial court's rulings on tolling and estoppel.Â  However, it appears the Posts'\r\n  cause of action was timely for at least two payments made by the Posts.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we remand this action to the trial court to determine the refund\r\n  due to the Posts.

Hudgins, South Carolina Commission\r\n  on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Benjamin Aplin, South Carolina Dept. of Probation, Parole and\r\n  Pardon Services, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J.: Hoss Hicks (Hicks) appeals the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s probation revocation and imposition of additional conditions of\r\n  probation on the grounds that it violated separation of powers principles as\r\n  well as the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and South Carolina\r\n  Constitutions.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  September 14, 2005, Hicks waived grand jury presentment and pled guilty to one\r\n  count of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  The charges\r\n  stemmed from an encounter with a fourteen-year-old girl. Â Hicks was sentenced\r\n  to ten years imprisonment suspended upon time served with five years\r\n  probation.Â  As a condition of probation, the sentencing judge held Hicks was to\r\n  have no contact with and was not to live within five miles of the victim or her\r\n  family.Â  Hicks was further required to complete one hundred hours of public\r\n  service and submit to random drug testing.Â  Hicks was not, however, required to\r\n  register as a sex offender.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  September 14, 2005 sentencing order also incorporated the Department of\r\n  Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' (the Department) standard conditions of\r\n  probation (the Standard Conditions).Â  One of the Standard Conditions is\r\n  Condition Two, which states: â€œI shall not change my residence or employment\r\n  without the consent of my Agent.Â  Further, I shall allow my Agent to visit me\r\n  in my home, at my place of employment, or elsewhere at any time.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 15, 2005, the State filed a motion to reconsider the sentence.Â  A\r\n  hearing was held, and in an order issued December 12, 2005, the sentencing\r\n  judge changed the initial sentence by ordering Hicks to register under the\r\n  South Carolina Sex Offender Registry (the Registry).Â  The other requirements of\r\n  the original sentence remained unchanged.Â  Hicks appealed the sentencing\r\n  judge's decision requiring him to register.[1]Â  \r\nBeginning\r\n  in January 2006, the Department instituted a new policy (the Sex Offender\r\n  Policy), the goals of which were â€œto effectively supervise sex offenders, to\r\n  protect the public, and to promote the rehabilitation of the offendersâ€ and\r\n  &quot;to reduce the likelihood of future sexual victimization.&quot;Â  Under the\r\n  Sex Offender Policy, any person who, as of January 1, 2006, was required to\r\n  register pursuant to the terms of the Registry and was being supervised by the\r\n  Department would be subject to the standard sex offender conditions (the Sex\r\n  Offender Conditions).Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 19, 2006, Hicks appeared before the circuit court for a probation violation\r\n  hearing.Â  The violation report alleged, among other things,[2] Hicks had violated Condition Nine of the Sex Offender Conditions[3] (Condition Nine) by spending a night at the residence of the mother of his\r\n  child.Â  As to the alleged violation of Condition Nine, Hicks argued that by\r\n  basing his revocation, even in part, on a violation of Condition Nine, the\r\n  circuit court's imposition of the Sex Offender Conditions violated separation\r\n  of powers principles as well as the Ex Post Facto Clause. The probation judge disagreed\r\n  and issued a written order finding Hicks had violated the conditions of his probation.Â  In the order, the court revoked probation, required Hicks to serve ninety\r\n  days of his suspended sentence, and added, as a condition of probation, all of\r\n  the Sex Offender Conditions.Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the circuit court imposed the additional Sex Offender Conditions on Hicks'\r\n  probation, counsel for Hicks requested the court hear his specific objections\r\n  as to the reasonableness of each of the conditions.Â  The circuit court refused\r\n  to address the objections.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision to revoke probation is in the discretion of the circuit court.Â  State\r\n    v. Williamson, 356 S.C. 507, 510, 589 S.E.2d 787, 788&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2003).Â  An appellate court's authority to review such a decision is confined to\r\n  correcting errors of law unless the lack of legal or evidentiary basis\r\n  indicates the circuit court's decision was arbitrary and capricious.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW &amp; ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Separation of\r\n  Powers\r\nHicks\r\n  argues the circuit court's revocation of his probation based, at least in part,\r\n  on violating Condition Nine of the Sex Offender Conditions violates separation\r\n  of powers principles because the Sex Offender Conditions were not judicially\r\n  imposed.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially,\r\n  the State argues Hicks' failure to pay fines and supervision fees constitute\r\n  additional sustaining grounds to affirm the circuit court's revocation. Â We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  basis for respondent's additional sustaining grounds must appear in the record\r\n  on appeal.Â  State v. Arnold, 319 S.C. 256, 260, 460 S.E.2d 403, 405 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995).Â  At the revocation hearing, Hicks argued his failure to pay was not\r\n  willful because he was unable to secure work.Â  However, the circuit court never\r\n  ruled on the issue of willfulness, instead appearing more concerned with Hicks'\r\n  constitutional arguments.Â  The trial court, therefore, never made an\r\n  on-the-record finding that Hicks' failure to pay was willful.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  State's argument is without merit.Â  See State v. Spare, 374 S.C.\r\n  264, 268-69, 647 S.E.2d 706, 708 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding probation cannot be\r\n  revoked solely for the failure to pay fines unless the trial court makes a\r\n  finding on the record that probationer willfully failed to pay).Â  \r\nNevertheless,\r\n  we believe the revocation was proper because Condition Nine is merely an enhancement\r\n  of a previous, judicially ordered condition, specifically Condition Two of the\r\n  Standard Conditions, which prohibits Hicks from changing his residence or\r\n  employment without the consent of his agent.\r\nSection\r\n  24-21-430 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) states: â€œTo effectively supervise\r\n  probationers, the [Department] director shall develop policies and procedures\r\n  for imposing conditions of supervision on probationers. These conditions may enhance but must not diminish court imposed conditions.â€ Â (emphasis\r\n  added). Â In other words, Â§ 24-21-430 permits the Department to impose conditions\r\n  of supervision that enhance conditions of probation ordered by the sentencing\r\n  judge.Â  State v. Stevens, 373 S.C. 595, 598, 646 S.E.2d 870, 872 (2007).\r\nIn Stevens,\r\n  the appellant was alleged to have violated certain probationary conditions.Â  Id.Â \r\n  In lieu of issuing a probation revocation warrant based on violations of court\r\n  imposed conditions, the Department entered into an agreement with the appellant\r\n  whereby he consented to participate in the Department's Global Position System\r\n  (GPS) Program.Â  Id.Â  Under the agreement, the appellant agreed to avoid\r\n  certain &quot;exclusion zones&quot; near his former girlfriend's home and\r\n  work.Â  Id.Â  Two months later, the Department issued a probation\r\n  revocation warrant alleging appellant violated a condition of probation by\r\n  entering one of the exclusion zones established by the agreement.Â  Id.Â \r\n  At the probation revocation hearing, appellant argued his violation of the\r\n  agreement could not be the basis for a probation revocation because the terms\r\n  of the agreement were not court imposed conditions.Â  Id.Â  The circuit court\r\n  disagreed and revoked six months for his violation of an exclusion zone\r\n  condition.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court reversed.Â  Stevens, 373 S.C. at 597, 646 S.E.2d at 871.Â \r\n  The Court held Â§ 24-21-430 does not authorize the Department to add conditions\r\n  of probation, only conditions of supervision.Â  Id.Â  In explaining the\r\n  difference between the two, the Court used the example of Â§ 24-21-430(11),\r\n  which requires a probationer to &quot;submit to intensive surveillance[,] which\r\n  may include surveillance by electronic means.&quot;Â  Stevens, 373 S.C.\r\n  at 872, 646 S.E.2d at 598.Â  The Court stated:\r\n\r\n\tWhere\r\n  condition 11 is imposed by the court, [the Department] may require the\r\n  probationer to participate in the GPS program as a condition of supervision\r\n  under Â§ 24-21-430 because this program would &quot;enhance . . . court[]imposed\r\n  conditions[.]&quot;Â  Under these circumstances, a violation of the GPS\r\n  monitoring [condition] would be a violation of the &quot;enhanced court imposed\r\n  conditions&quot; and therefore grounds for revocation.Â  In this case, however,\r\n  the sentencing court chose not to [impose condition 11]; [the Department]\r\n  therefore could not unilaterally impose GPS monitoring on appellant as this\r\n  method of supervision did not enhance a judicially[]ordered condition of\r\n  probation.\r\n\r\nStevens, 373 S.C. at 872, 646 S.E.2d at 598.Â  Thus, while the\r\n  probationer's failure to avoid the exclusion zones violated the GPS monitoring\r\n  condition of the agreement, such a violation was not grounds for probation\r\n  revocation because the agreement itself was not an enhancement of any\r\n  judicially ordered condition.Â  Id. at 872, 646 S.E.2d at 599.\r\nThe\r\n  present case, however, is distinguishable from Stevens.Â  Here, the\r\n  sentencing judge incorporated by reference the Standard Conditions as part of\r\n  Hicks' original sentence.Â  Condition Two of the Standard Conditions prohibits\r\n  Hicks from changing his residence or employment without the consent of the\r\n  agent.Â  Likewise, Condition Nine of the Sex Offender Conditions prevents a\r\n  probationer from changing residence or employment without the consent of the\r\n  agent.Â  When the circuit court imposed Condition Nine of the Sex Offender\r\n  Conditions, this was merely an &quot;enhancement&quot; of Condition Two, a\r\n  judicially ordered condition of probation.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court's\r\n  revocation was consistent with Â§ 24-21-430.\r\nB.&nbsp; Ex Post Facto\r\n  Clause \r\nHicks\r\n  argues the circuit court's imposition of the additional Sex Offender Conditions\r\n  violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because the Sex Offender Conditions were\r\n  neither ordered by the sentencing judge nor in place at the time of\r\n  sentencing.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and\r\n  South Carolina Constitutions prohibit the enactment of any law that imposes a\r\n  punishment for an act that was not punishable at the time it was committed or\r\n  imposes additional punishment to what was then prescribed. Â Weaver v. Graham,\r\n  450 U.S. 24, 28 (1981); see also Cooper v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Prob., Parole &amp; Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 489, 501, 661 S.E.2d 106, 113\r\n  (2008) (stating an ex post facto\r\n  violation occurs when a change in the law retroactively alters the definition\r\n  of a crime or increases punishment for a crime).Â  A law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if (1) the law applies to\r\n  events that occurred before its enactment and (2) the offender of the law is\r\n  disadvantaged by the law.Â  State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 30, 558 S.E.2d\r\n  524, 525 (2002). Â \r\nThe\r\n  State argues element (1) is not satisfied because the statute that authorizes\r\n  the Department to enhance court imposed conditions has existed in its current\r\n  version since before Hicks' conviction. Â We agree.Â  \r\nIn Cooper,\r\n  the Supreme Court held the Parole Board did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause\r\n  when, several years after Cooper's conviction, the Board established factors to\r\n  be considered in granting or denying parole and denied parole based on those\r\n  factors.Â  377 S.C. at 501, 661 S.E.2d at 112.Â  The Supreme Court held the Board\r\n  had not &quot;changed the standards for granting parole&quot; and, therefore,\r\n  had not applied the law retroactively because S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640, which\r\n  specifically authorizes the Board to establish written criteria for granting\r\n  parole, had not been substantively amended since before Cooper's conviction.Â  Cooper,\r\n  377 S.C. at 501, 661 S.E.2d at 112.Â  Here, Â§ 24-21-430, which gives the\r\n  Department the authority to enhance court-imposed probation conditions, has existed\r\n  in its current version since May 20, 1996, nine years before Hicks was\r\n  convicted.Â  Accordingly, the Ex Post Facto Clause was not violated.\r\nC.&nbsp; Addition of All\r\n  Standard Sex Offender Conditions\r\nHicks\r\n  argues the circuit court lacked authority to impose upon him all of the Sex\r\n  Offender Conditions.Â  The State argues this issue is not preserved for review\r\n  because it was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  We agree\r\n  with the State.\r\nFor\r\n  an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142,\r\n  587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003).Â  At the probation revocation hearing, after the circuit\r\n  court added the Sex Offender Conditions to Hicks' probation, Hicks asked the circuit\r\n  court to address whether each of the Sex Offender Conditions was reasonable.Â \r\n  Hicks did not, however, challenge the circuit court's underlying authority to\r\n  add the Sex Offender Conditions to the existing conditions of probation.Â Â \r\n  Accordingly, the issue is not properly preserved.Â  \r\nIn any event, Â§ 24-21-430 gave the circuit court in\r\n  this case the authority to modify Hicks' probation by imposing the additional\r\n  Sex Offender Standards.\r\nHicks\r\n  argues only the sentencing judge, not the probation judge, has the authority to\r\n  modify conditions of probation.Â  To support this position, Hicks cites State\r\n    v. Davis, 375 S.C. 12, 649 S.E.2d 178 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  There, this Court\r\n  held a probation judge was not authorized to order placement on the Registry as\r\n  a condition of probation.Â  Id. at 17, 649 S.E.2d at 180.\r\nHowever, Davis is distinguishable from the present case.Â  In Davis, the\r\n  probation judge lacked the authority to order placement on the Registry for two\r\n  reasons.Â  First, the State had already plea bargained away that condition at\r\n  the sentencing hearing.Â  Id. at 16, 649 S.E.2d at 180.Â  Thus, once the\r\n  sentencing judge's order became final, neither he nor the probation judge could\r\n  add placement on the Registry without dishonoring the plea agreement.Â  Id.Â \r\n  In the present case, the State did not plea bargain away the Sex Offender\r\n  Conditions.Â  \r\nSecond,\r\n  the statute at issue in Davis, Â§ 23-3-430(D),[4] granted the power to order inclusion on the Registry only to the\r\n  &quot;presiding judge,&quot; i.e., the sentencing judge.Â  Id. at 17, 649\r\n  S.E.2d at 180.Â  The present case deals with a different set of statutory\r\n  provisions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 states, &quot;[T]he judge of a\r\n  court of record with criminal jurisdiction at the time of sentence may . . .\r\n  place the defendant on probation.&quot;Â  (2007) (emphasis added).Â  However, Â§\r\n  24-21-430 states, &quot;The court . . . may at any time modify the\r\n  conditions of probation[.]&quot; (emphasis added).Â  Thus, while Â§ 24-21-410\r\n  gives the power to impose probation to the sentencing judge alone, Â§ 24-21-430\r\n  gives the power to modify probation conditions to &quot;the court&quot; of\r\n  general session of the particular county, and therefore, the probation judge in\r\n  the present case had statutory authority to add the Sex Offender Conditions.Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the circuit court had the authority to modify the sentence by adding\r\n  all of the Sex Offender Conditions.\r\nD.&nbsp; Reasonableness\r\n  of Conditions\r\nHicks\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in refusing to make a determination as to the\r\n  reasonableness of each of the additional Sex Offender Conditions.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court will not reverse the circuit court's decision regarding\r\n  probation unless the circuit court abused its discretion.Â  State v. Allen,\r\n  370 S.C. 88, 94, 634 S.E.2d 653, 656 (2006).Â  Section 24-21-430 vests judges\r\n  with &quot;a wide, but not unlimited, discretion in imposing conditions of\r\n  suspension or probation.&quot;Â  State v. Brown, 284 S.C. 407, 410, 326\r\n  S.E.2d 410, 411 (1985).Â  However, conditions of probation must be reasonable and\r\n  judges cannot impose conditions that are illegal and void as against public\r\n  policy.Â  Beckner v. State,&nbsp;296 S.C. 365, 366, 373 S.E.2d 469,\r\n  469&nbsp;(1988); Brown, 284 S.C. at 410, 326 S.E.2d at 411.Â  As the\r\n  Court stated in Allen:\r\n\r\n\tVarious\r\n  conditions of probation generally have been upheld unless (1) the condition is\r\n  so unreasonable or overly broad that compliance is virtually impossible and the\r\n  burden imposed on the probationer is greatly disproportionate to any\r\n  rehabilitative function the condition might serve; (2) the condition has no\r\n  relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted; (3) the\r\n  condition requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future\r\n  criminality; (4) the condition relates to conduct which is not in itself\r\n  criminal unless the prohibited conduct is reasonably related to the crime of\r\n  which the offender was convicted or to future criminality; (5) the condition\r\n  violates due process because it is overly broad or void for vagueness; or (6)\r\n  the condition unnecessarily or excessively tramples upon First Amendment rights\r\n  of free association.Â  \r\n\r\n370\r\n  S.C. at 97, 634 S.E.2d at 657.\r\nWe do not believe the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion by refusing to address the reasonableness of each of the Sex\r\n  Offender Conditions for several reasons.Â  First, there is no statutory\r\n  requirement that the probation judge explicitly address the reasonableness of\r\n  each and every probation condition imposed.Â  Second, we do not believe the Sex\r\n  Offender Conditions are so unreasonable or overly broad as to be void as\r\n  against public policy or their burden on Hicks is greatly disproportionate to\r\n  the protective functions they serve.Â  Third, the Sex Offender Conditions are\r\n  related to Hicks' original crime, and they forbid conduct that is reasonably\r\n  related to future criminality.Â  Fourth, Hicks can raise the issue of\r\n  reasonableness again if and when the Department seeks to revoke his probation\r\n  on the basis of violating any of the Sex Offender Conditions.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] That decision\r\n  was affirmed by this Court on March 18, 2008.Â  State v. Hicks, 377 S.C.\r\n  322, 324, 659 S.E.2d 499, 500 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n[2] Also included\r\n  in the violation report were allegations Hicks failed to pay supervision fees\r\n  and a fine.Â  \r\n[3] Condition Nine states:\r\n  â€œI will at all times maintain a suitable residence, approved by my agent, which\r\n  complies with all conditions of my supervision, which may not be within one\r\n  thousand (1000) feet of any area frequented by people under the age of 18,\r\n  including but not limited to schools, day care centers, playgrounds, arcades,\r\n  swimming pools or beaches, shopping malls, or theaters.Â  I will obtain approval\r\n  from my agent of my residence and employment and shall obtain prior approval\r\n  from my agent before changing my residence or employment.Â  I will stay at my\r\n  approved residence every night and will not sleep or stay overnight anywhere\r\n  else without prior approval of my agent.â€Â  \r\n[4] &quot;Upon\r\n  conviction, adjudication of delinquency, guilty plea, or plea of nolo\r\n  contendere of a person of an offense not listed in this article, the presiding\r\n  judge may order as a condition of sentencing that the person be included in the\r\n  sex offender registry if good cause is shown by the solicitor.&quot;Â  S.C.

Goldstein, of North Charleston; for Appellant.\r\n        Timothy Alan Domin, of Charleston; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.: In this appeal, Jeffrey Harbit\r\n  (Harbit) argues that the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment in\r\n  favor of the City of Charleston (the City) on several claims stemming from the\r\n  City's refusal to rezone Harbit's single family residential property for limited\r\n  commercial use.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHarbit is the owner of property located at 7 Wesley\r\n  Drive, which is within the Cityâ€™s limits.Â  The property is on the corner of\r\n  Wesley Drive and Stocker Drive.Â  The house at 7 Wesley Drive faces Wesley Drive\r\n  with a rear entrance and driveway accessible only from Stocker Drive.Â  Wesley\r\n  Drive is a five-lane thoroughfare, connecting Folly Road to Highways 17 and\r\n  61.Â  Stocker Drive is a purely residential street, which may be accessed from\r\n  the heavier-traveled Wesley Drive. \r\nAt\r\n  all times pertinent to this appeal, this property has been zoned for single\r\n  family residential purposes.Â  Harbit purchased this property in 2003 for\r\n  $180,000 from Truett Nettles (Nettles).Â  Prior to selling the property to\r\n  Harbit, Nettles attempted to rezone the property for limited commercial use as\r\n  an attorney's office, but the City denied his request.Â  Harbit was aware of the\r\n  Cityâ€™s denial of Nettles' request for rezoning when he purchased the property\r\n  from Nettles in 2003. \r\nIn 2005, Harbit applied for rezoning of the Wesley\r\n  Drive property based on its location within the Savannah Highway Overlay Zone\r\n  (the Zone).Â  The Zone was created as a result of a comprehensive study of land\r\n  surrounding the Ashley River Bridge in Charleston.[1]Â \r\n  Based on this study, the City developed the &quot;Ashley Bridge District&quot;\r\n  plan, which identified the need to maintain residential communities in the\r\n  Zone, despite increased commercialization.Â  While highlighting the need to\r\n  maintain residential uses in the Zone, the plan allows certain properties along\r\n  Savannah Highway and Wesley Drive to be used for limited commercial purposes,\r\n  including professional office use.Â  Under the Ashley Bridge District plan, the\r\n  other properties on Harbit's side of Wesley Drive within the Zone have been\r\n  rezoned for limited commercial use.Â  \r\nOn June 15, 2005, the City of Charleston Planning\r\n  Commission (the Planning Commission) reviewed Harbit's application, at which\r\n  time Harbit's counsel presented Harbit's position for rezoning the Wesley Drive\r\n  property.Â  The Planning Commission, however, voted to recommend denying Harbit's\r\n  rezoning application, finding the request was in contradiction to the Ashley\r\n  Bridge District plan and the overall neighborhood sentiment to retain the\r\n  residential use of the structures within the area.Â  On September 27, 2005,\r\n  Charleston City Council (City Council) received the Planning Commission's\r\n  recommendation and held a public hearing to address local zoning issues,\r\n  including Harbit's application.Â  Harbit's counsel was present for the City\r\n  Council meeting.Â  City Council denied Harbit's request, citing a concern\r\n  over increased commercialization, loss of residential use, and the special\r\n  location of the property at the entrance of a residential neighborhood,\r\n  particularly its frontage on a purely residential street.Â  \r\nAfter City Council's denial of his application, Harbit\r\n  appealed the zoning decision to the circuit court and asserted additional\r\n  grounds for relief, including a request for a writ of mandamus and causes of\r\n  action for due process and equal protection violations.Â  The City filed a\r\n  motion for summary judgment on all claims, which the circuit court granted.Â  In\r\n  its order, the circuit court found a writ of mandamus was inappropriate because\r\n  zoning is not a ministerial act and thus cannot be mandated by the court.[2]Â \r\n  In dismissing Harbit's claims for procedural and substantive due process, the circuit\r\n  court found Harbit was provided with sufficient notice to satisfy his\r\n  procedural due process rights, and because he had no prior property interest in\r\n  commercial zoning, his substantive due process rights were not violated.Â \r\n  Regarding Harbit's equal protection claim, the circuit court found City Council\r\n  had a rational basis for denying Harbit's application such that Harbit was\r\n  afforded equal protection of the law.Â  It is from this order that Harbit now\r\n  appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the circuit court.Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C.\r\n  242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The circuit court should grant summary\r\n  judgment &quot;if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia\r\n    Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334&nbsp;(2003).Â  In\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  &quot;The purpose of summary judgment is to\r\n  expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact\r\n  finder.&quot;Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874\r\n  (2001). Â Summary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the\r\n  facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Englert, Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc., 377 S.C. 129, 134, 659 S.E.2d 496, 498 (2008).Â  \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nDo genuine issues\r\n  of material fact exist on Harbit's claims such that the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to the City as a matter of law?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. &quot;Fairly Debatable&quot; Standard in Zoning\r\n  Decisions\r\nHarbit\r\n  asserts that viewing the evidence in his favor, City Council's refusal to\r\n  rezone Harbit's property is so unreasonable that this Court should invalidate\r\n  City Council's decision. We disagree.\r\nRezoning is a\r\n  legislative matter.Â  Lenardis v. City of Greenville, 316 S.C. 471, 471,\r\n  450 S.E.2d 597, 597 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The legislative body's decision in zoning\r\n  matters is presumptively valid, and the property owner has the burden of\r\n  proving to the contrary.Â  Rushing v. City of Greenville, 265 S.C. 285,\r\n  288, 217 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1975).Â  The authority of a municipality to enact\r\n  zoning ordinances that restrict the use of privately owned property is founded\r\n  in the municipality's police power.Â  Rush v. City of Greenville, 246\r\n  S.C. 268, 276, 143 S.E.2d 527, 530-31 (1965).Â  The governing bodies of\r\n  municipalities clothed with authority to decide residential and industrial\r\n  districts are better qualified by their knowledge of the situation to act upon\r\n  these matters than are the courts, and their decisions will not be interfered\r\n  with unless there is a plain violation of the constitutional rights of\r\n  citizens.Â  Id.Â  As in this case, the determinative question is whether\r\n  the city council's refusal to change the zoning of the owner's property is so\r\n  unreasonable as to impair or destroy the owner's constitutional rights.Â  Rushing,\r\n  265 S.C. at 288, 217 S.E.2d at 799.Â  We cannot insinuate our judgment into a\r\n  review of the city council's decision but must leave that decision undisturbed\r\n  if the propriety of that decision is even &quot;fairly debatable.&quot;Â  Knowles\r\n    v. City of Aiken, 305 S.C. 219, 223, 407 S.E.2d 639, 642 (1991).Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  there is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of municipal zoning\r\n  ordinances, and in favor of the validity of their application, and when the\r\n  planning commission and the city council of a municipality have acted after\r\n  reviewing all of the facts, the court should not disturb the finding unless\r\n  such action is arbitrary, unreasonable, or in clear abuse of its discretion, or\r\n  unless it has acted illegally and in excess of its lawfully delegated\r\n  authority.Â  Bob Jones Univ., Inc. v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351,\r\n  360, 133 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1963).Â  Likewise, the power to declare an ordinance\r\n  invalid because it is so unreasonable as to impair or destroy constitutional\r\n  rights is one which will be exercised carefully and cautiously, as it is not\r\n  the court's function to pass upon the wisdom or expediency of municipal\r\n  ordinances or regulations.Â  Id.\r\nWe find that City\r\n  Council's decision is &quot;fairly debatable&quot; because the City proffered\r\n  several reasonable grounds for the denial of Harbit's rezoning application.Â \r\n  First, the Planning Commission and City Council concluded that rezoning Harbit's\r\n  property would not be in the community's best interests because the City has a\r\n  vested interest in preserving the area's residential character and in\r\n  minimizing commercialization.Â  As stated in the Ashley Bridge District Plan,\r\n  one of the major concerns in this area was increased commercialization due to\r\n  rezoning.Â  Further, both the Planning Commission and City Council cited\r\n  concerns of neighborhood residents who feared loss of residential use in the\r\n  area and the possibility that continued rezoning would create a domino effect.Â  While all of the residents' concerns\r\n  might not be well-founded, City Council's response to public opposition does\r\n  not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.Â  See Sunrise\r\n    Corp. of Myrtle Beach v. City of Myrtle Beach, 420 F.3d 322, 329 (4th Cir.\r\n  2005) (in finding the state court of appeals' decision was not res judicata of\r\n  the developers' Â§ 1983 due process and equal protection claims, the Fourth\r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals determined the city council's improper denial of the\r\n  zoning application in response to public opposition did not rise to the level\r\n  of a constitutional violation because &quot;matters of zoning are inherently\r\n  political, and [] it is a zoning official's responsibility to mediate disputes\r\n  between developers[] and local residents&quot;). Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  City Council specifically cited the unique location of Harbit's property as\r\n  opposed to other properties on Wesley Drive that were zoned for limited\r\n  commercial use, noting that two of its sides are situated on the interior of\r\n  the neighborhood.Â  Moreover, because it is a corner lot, the property\r\n  effectively serves as a buffer between the heavier-traveled Wesley Drive and\r\n  the purely residential Stocker Drive.Â  See Hampton v. Richland County,\r\n  292 S.C. 500, 503, 357 S.E.2d 463, 465 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding the city\r\n  council's refusal to rezone property from an office and industrial\r\n  classification to a general commercial classification was &quot;fairly\r\n  debatable&quot; because the property lay between commercial and residential\r\n  properties thus creating a buffer between the two zones). \r\nWhile\r\n  other similarly situated properties on Wesley Drive are zoned for limited\r\n  commercial use, the record does not indicate that Harbit was the subject of\r\n  purposeful, invidious discrimination.Â  See Sylvia Dev. Corp. v.\r\n    Calvert County, Md., 48 F.3d 810, 825 (4th Cir. 1995) (internal citations\r\n  omitted) (&quot;If disparate treatment alone were sufficient to warrant a\r\n  constitutional remedy, then every blunder by a local authority, in which the\r\n  authority erroneously or mistakenly treats an individual differently than it\r\n  treats another who is similarly situated, would rise to the level of a federal\r\n  constitutional claim.&quot;). Â For instance, there are other properties on\r\n  Harbit's side of Wesley Drive that are currently zoned residential, and with\r\n  the exception of one property cornering on Savannah Highway and Wesley Drive,\r\n  all of the properties on the other side of Wesley Drive are zoned residential.Â \r\n  The properties on his side of Wesley Drive that are zoned for limited\r\n  commercial use are distinguishable in that they either also front on Savannah\r\n  Highway or are not accessed by a purely residential street. \r\nBased on the\r\n  evidence in the record, the City properly denied Harbit's rezoning application\r\n  in an effort to hold the line on commercial development in the area and protect\r\n  its residential nature.Â  We will not invalidate City Council's decision as its\r\n  propriety is at least &quot;fairly debatable&quot; based on the facts and is\r\n  not &quot;so unreasonable as to impair or destroy constitutional rights.&quot;Â  See Knowles, 305 S.C. at 224, 407 S.E.2d at 642.Â  As such, it is\r\n  not this Court's function to pass upon the wisdom or expediency of City\r\n  Council's decision.Â  See Bob Jones Univ., Inc., 243 S.C. at 360,\r\n  133 S.E.2d at 847.\r\nB. Due Process\r\nHarbit contends the circuit court erred in dismissing his\r\n  procedural and substantive due process claims.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\n  1. Procedural Due\r\n    Process\r\n\r\nProcedural due process imposes constraints on governmental\r\n  decisions that deprive individuals of liberty or property interests within the\r\n  meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the\r\n  United States Constitution. Â U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, Â§1; Mathews v.\r\n    Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 331 (1976). Â The fundamental requirements of due\r\n  process under the United States Constitution and the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution include notice, an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way,\r\n  and judicial review. Â U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, Â§1; S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§\r\n  22; Stono River Envtl. Prot. Ass'n v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl.\r\n    Control, 305 S.C. 90, 94, 406 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1991). Â Further,\r\n  due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\r\n  particular situation demands.Â  Kurschner v. City of Camden Planning Comm'n,\r\n  376 S.C. 165, 172, 656 S.E.2d 346, 350 (2008).Â  \r\nWe are\r\n  of the opinion that Harbit received due process, both procedural and\r\n  substantive, thus entitling the City to judgment as a matter of law.Â  First,\r\n  Harbit was afforded procedural due process because he was provided with notice\r\n  of both public hearings as evidenced by the rezoning application that he\r\n  completed and signed.[3]Â \r\n  He also had a meaningful opportunity to be heard as he was allowed to present\r\n  his arguments at both the Planning Commission and City Council levels.Â  While\r\n  Harbit chose not to be present, his attorney represented Harbit's interests by\r\n  presenting exhibits and arguing Harbit's position for rezoning his property in\r\n  both instances.Â  \r\nFurther, Harbit has received three levels of review, in each of\r\n  which he was allowed to present his position.[4]Â \r\n  The existence of review is an indication of the presence of procedural due\r\n  process, rather than its absence.Â  See Sunrise, 420 F.3d at 328 (finding\r\n  district court properly granted cityâ€™s motion for summary judgment on\r\n  developers' claims for due process violations after city denied building permit\r\n  as developers received four levels of state review which was &quot;an\r\n  indication of the existence of procedural due process, rather than its absence&quot;).Â \r\n  Because Harbit was provided with both predeprivation and postdeprivation\r\n  remedies, his procedural due process rights were not violated.Â  \r\n\r\n  2. Substantive Due\r\n    Process\r\n\r\nIn order to prove a denial of substantive due process, a party\r\n  must show that he was arbitrarily and capriciously deprived of a cognizable\r\n  property interest rooted in state law.Â  Sunset Cay, LLC v. City of Folly\r\n    Beach, 357 S.C. 414, 430, 593 S.E.2d 462, 470 (2004).Â  The State's\r\n  deprivation of the property interest must fall so far beyond the outer\r\n  boundaries of legitimate governmental authority that no process could remedy\r\n  the deficiency.Â  Sunrise, 420 F.3d at 328.Â  A legislative body does not\r\n  deny due process simply because it does not permit a landowner to make the most\r\n  beneficial use of its property.Â  Bear Enters. v. County of Greenville,\r\n  319 S.C. 137, 141, 459 S.E.2d 883, 886 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In reviewing a\r\n  substantive due process challenge to a zoning ordinance, we must determine\r\n  whether the ordinance bears a reasonable relationship to any legitimate\r\n  government interest.Â  See Sunset, 357 S.C. at 430, 593 S.E.2d at\r\n  470 (stating that the standard of review for all substantive due process\r\n  challenges to state statutes, including municipal ordinances, is whether the\r\n  statute bears a reasonable relationship to any legitimate interest of\r\n  government). \r\nThe City did not\r\n  violate Harbit's substantive due process rights when it denied his rezoning\r\n  application.Â  First, Harbit did not have a prior property interest in\r\n  commercial zoning.Â  While Harbit may have purchased the property with the\r\n  expectation that City Council would grant his application, this alone is\r\n  insufficient to establish a violation of his constitutional rights.Â  See Rush, 246 S.C. at 280-81, 143 S.E.2d at 533 (citing to 62 C.J.S., Municipal\r\n    Corporations, Â§ 227(11)) (&quot;Although it is an element in the situation\r\n  which is entitled to fair and careful consideration, mere disadvantage in\r\n  property value or income, or both, to a single owner of property, resulting\r\n  from application of zoning restrictions ordinarily does not warrant relaxation\r\n  in his favor . . . .&quot;); Hampton, 292 S.C. at 503-04, 357 S.E.2d at 465\r\n  (holding a property owner is not entitled to have his property zoned for its\r\n  most profitable use).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Harbit was aware at the time of purchasing 7 Wesley Drive that the prior owner's\r\n  application had been denied based on the same zoning restrictions and that his\r\n  efforts might likely share the same fate.Â  See id. at 281, 143\r\n  S.E.2d at 533 (internal citation omitted) (in denying the plaintiff's variance\r\n  request, the supreme court found that the plaintiff who purchased property\r\n  after a zoning restriction was in effect must have contemplated potential\r\n  hardships, financial or otherwise, resulting from the existing conditions at\r\n  the time of purchase).Â  Because the City's decision was reasonably founded and\r\n  rationally related to its stated interests of preserving the area's residential\r\n  character in the face of continuing commercialization, whether it be strictly\r\n  commercial or limited commercial use, the City's actions did not rise to the\r\n  level of being arbitrary or capricious and thus did not violate Harbit's\r\n  substantive due process rights.\r\nC. Equal Protection \r\nHarbit\r\n  also asserts the circuit court erred in dismissing his equal protection claim.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nUnder the\r\n  Equal&nbsp;Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a state may not &quot;deny\r\n  to any person within its jurisdiction the equal&nbsp;protection of the\r\n  laws.&quot;Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; see S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3\r\n  (&quot;The privileges and immunities of citizens of this State and of the\r\n  United States under this Constitution shall not be abridged, nor shall any\r\n  person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law,\r\n  nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.&quot;).Â  This\r\n  clause requires that &quot;the states apply each law, within its scope, equally\r\n  to persons similarly situated, and that any differences of application must be\r\n  justified by the law's purpose.&quot;Â Sylvia\r\n    Dev. Corp., 48 F.3d at 818.Â  It does not prohibit different treatment of\r\n  people in different circumstances under the law.Â  Town of Iva ex rel. Zoning\r\n    Adminsitrator v. Holley, 374 S.C. 537, 541, 649 S.E.2d 108, 110 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  Instead, &quot;'the classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary,\r\n  and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial\r\n  relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly\r\n  circumstanced shall be treated alike.'&quot;Â  Id.Â  In a case such as this, the rational basis standard,\r\n  rather than strict scrutiny, applies because the classification at issue does\r\n  not affect a fundamental right and does not draw upon inherently suspect\r\n  distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage.Â  Sunset Cay, 357 S.C.\r\n  at 428-29, 593 S.E.2d at 469.Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, one seeking to show discriminatory\r\n  enforcement in violation of the Equal&nbsp;Protection Clause must demonstrate\r\n  arbitrary and purposeful discrimination in the administration of the law being\r\n  enforced.Â  See State v. Solomon, 245 S.C. 550, 574, 141 S.E.2d 818, 831 (1965).\r\n  &nbsp; &quot;[E]ven assuming [a governmental entity] is not enforcing [an]\r\n  ordinance equally, the fact that there is some unequal treatment does not\r\n  necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional equal&nbsp;protection\r\n  violation.&quot; Â Denene, Inc. v.\r\n    City of Charleston, 359 S.C. 85, 96, 596 S.E.2d 917, 922 (2004).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  City had a rational basis to deny Harbit's application, despite the fact that\r\n  other properties on Wesley Drive were zoned for limited commercial use.Â  As the\r\n  circuit court notes in its order, Harbit's property is the only one of those\r\n  properties which has frontage on Stocker Drive.Â  Further, unlike the other\r\n  properties, Harbit's property effectively serves as a buffer between the purely\r\n  residential Stocker Drive and the heavier-traveled Wesley Drive.Â  In contrast\r\n  to Harbit's property, the other corner property on his side of Wesley Drive\r\n  that is zoned for limited commercial use has frontage on Savannah Highway and\r\n  abuts other commercial property.Â  Consequently, because the record does not\r\n  indicate that Harbit was the subject of purposeful, invidious discrimination,\r\n  the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment on his equal\r\n  protection claim.Â  See Sylvia Dev. Corp., 48 F.3d at 825\r\n  (internal citations omitted) (&quot;While an equal protection claim must be\r\n  rooted in an allegation of unequal treatment for similarly situated\r\n  individuals, a showing of such disparate treatment, even if the product of\r\n  erroneous or illegal state action, is not enough by itself to state a\r\n  constitutional claim.&quot;).Â  Consequently, the circuit court appropriately\r\n  granted summary judgment on Harbit's claims stemming from the denial of his\r\n  rezoning application.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court did not err\r\n  in granting the City's motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWilliams and Pieper, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] City of Charleston Zoning Ordinance Â§ 54-202(e)\r\n  (1996) states: &quot;Savannah Highway SH Overlay Zone.Â  The SH Overlay Zone is\r\n  intended to allow office and neighborhood service uses in addition to the uses\r\n  allowed in the base zoning district.Â  Existing structures in the SH zone that\r\n  are used for a non-residential use shall retain their residential appearance. .\r\n  . . Parking shall be restricted to the side or rear of the principal buildings\r\n  and buffering from adjoining residential lots shall be required.&quot; \r\n[2] Harbit does not appeal the circuit court's decision\r\n  on this issue. Â \r\n[3] The rezoning application that Harbit signed states,\r\n  &quot;The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing and make a\r\n  recommendation to City Council for approval, approval with conditions,\r\n  disapproval or deferral of the rezoning. . . . After the Planning Commission\r\n  makes its recommendation, the application will be forwarded to City Council\r\n  where another public hearing will be held approximately one month\r\n  later.&quot; Â (emphasis added).Â  \r\n[4] The Planning Commission's recommendation was reviewed\r\n  by City Council, whose decision was then reviewed by the circuit court, and is\r\n  now before this Court. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4512","title":"Robarge v.

Plaintiffs asserted that the condition violates an agreement between the District and the Cityâ€™s Commission of Public Works (Commission) that requires the Commission to provide water service to the Districtâ€™s residents.  The circuit court granted summary judgment to the City.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the unconditional obligation to provide water service applied only to those connections in existence at the time of the agreement's execution.  The Court held that as to any additions made to the water system after the agreement's execution, the agreement expressly conditioned the obligation to provide service based on the prevailing rules, regulations, policies and approval of the Greenville Water System.  The Court also held that the annexation covenant requirement did not unlawfully discriminate between different classes of owners of District properties.","date":"2009-02-27","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n  STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In\r\n  The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Janet C.

Â We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\nHISTORY\r\nThe District is a special purpose\r\n  district in Greenville County that was originally authorized to operate water and\r\n  sewer systems in its service area.Â  See Act No. 1087, Â§ 3, 1934 S.C.\r\n  Acts 1997, 2000; Act No. 443, Â§ 6, 1929 S.C. Acts 864, 866. Â In 1961, the\r\n  General Assembly enacted legislation authorizing special purpose districts in Greenville County to sell their water distribution systems to the City of Greenville.Â  Act\r\n  No. 559, 1961 S.C. Acts 1114.Â  Notably, the Act authorized special purpose\r\n  districts to impose terms and conditions on the sale, including covenants to supply\r\n  water to district properties.Â  Act No. 559, Â§ 2, 1961 Acts 1114-15.Â  In 1971, the\r\n  District entered into an agreement with the City and the Greenville Water\r\n  System for the sale of the District's water distribution system.Â  It is\r\n  undisputed that the Greenville Water System actually provided water service to the\r\n  District's properties both before and after the execution of the 1971\r\n  agreement.Â  \r\nIn 2002, the Greenville Water System\r\n  adopted a policy requiring owners of real property within a one-mile radius of\r\n  the City to execute a covenant consenting to annexation as a condition of receiving\r\n  any new connection (tap) to the water system's lines.[2]Â \r\n  The annexation covenant requirement does not apply to new accounts relating to\r\n  an existing tap or to owner-occupied residential property.Â  Â \r\nAfter the Greenville Water System adopted\r\n  the annexation policy, Robarge sought a new tap to the water system for a strip\r\n  shopping mall within the District's service area.Â  The Greenville Water System refused\r\n  to allow the new tap because Robarge would not sign an annexation covenant.Â  Likewise,\r\n  the Greenville Water System denied water service to the District for a sewer\r\n  pump station within the District's service area because the District's\r\n  representatives refused to sign an annexation covenant.\r\nAppellants\r\n  brought a declaratory judgment action against the City and the members of City\r\n  Council, seeking a declaration that the annexation covenant requirement\r\n  violated the 1971 agreement for the sale of the District's water distribution\r\n  system.Â  Appellants argued that the 1971 agreement required the Greenville\r\n  Water System to provide water service to the District's properties and did not\r\n  authorize the imposition of an annexation covenant requirement as a condition\r\n  for receiving service.Â  Appellants also argued that the annexation covenant\r\n  requirement violated provisions of the agreement that require equal treatment\r\n  of customers located outside the city limits.\r\nThe circuit court concluded that the 1971\r\n  agreement implicitly authorized the imposition of the annexation covenant\r\n  requirement on requests for new taps.Â  The circuit court also concluded that\r\n  the annexation covenant requirement did not run afoul of the equal treatment\r\n  provisions of the 1971 agreement or of the Equal Protection clauses of the\r\n  United States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Based on these\r\n  conclusions, the\r\n  circuit court granted the City's summary judgment motion and denied Appellants'\r\n  summary judgment motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  \r\n     1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Does\r\n  the 1971 agreement authorize the imposition of the annexation covenant\r\n  requirement on requests for new taps to the water system?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     2.&nbsp;\r\n    Does\r\n  the annexation covenant requirement unlawfully discriminate between different\r\n  classes of owners of District properties?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the grant of\r\n  a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard as that\r\n  required for the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341\r\n  S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Adamson v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 332\r\n  S.C. 121, 124, 503 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).Â  To determine if\r\n  any genuine issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Sauner\r\n    v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161,\r\n  165 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Contractual\r\n  Authorization to Impose Conditions on Water Service\r\nAppellants\r\n  assert that the 1971 agreement imposed an unconditional obligation on the Greenville\r\n  Water System to provide water service to properties located in the District.Â \r\n  Appellants argue that the annexation covenant requirement places a condition on\r\n  the provision of water service that was not authorized by the agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The construction of a clear and unambiguous contract is a\r\n  question of law for the court.&quot;Â  Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp.,\r\n  328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp; 1997) (internal\r\n  citations omitted).Â  &quot;The purpose of all\r\n  rules of contract construction is to ascertain the intention of the parties[,]\r\n  and that intention must be gathered from the entire agreement and not from any\r\n  one particular phrase . . . .&quot;Â  Reyhani v. Stone Creek Cove Condo. II Horizontal Prop. Regime, 329 S.C. 206, 212, 494 S.E.2d 465,&nbsp;468 (Ct. App.&nbsp;\r\n  1997).Â  \r\nThe 1971 agreement as a\r\n  whole imposes on the Greenville Water System an obligation to provide water\r\n  service to those taps that were in existence at the time of the agreement's\r\n  execution.Â  However, as to taps added after the date of the agreement, the Greenville\r\n  Water System's obligation to provide water service is conditional.Â  Paragraph IX of\r\n  the agreement provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  [F]rom the date of this agreement and\r\n    thereafter any additions, changes, or modifications of the water system within\r\n    the District shall be subject to the prevailing rules, regulations, policies\r\n    and approval of the Commission.Â  \r\n\r\nThis\r\n  language authorizes the Greenville Water System to impose reasonable conditions\r\n  on the provision of water service for any additions made to the water system\r\n  after the date of the agreement.Â  Similarly, paragraph VI(c) specifically\r\n  subjects new water lines to the &quot;then prevailing Commission policy&quot;\r\n  concerning the acceptance of new lines:\r\n\r\n  The Commission shall have no duty or\r\n    obligation to install water lines in undeveloped areas or prospective\r\n    subdivisions in the District, but . . . if such lines are installed therein by\r\n    private developers in accordance with the specifications, policies, rules, and\r\n    regulations of the Commission, such lines will be accepted in accordance with\r\n    the then prevailing Commission policy concerning such.\r\n\r\nTherefore, contrary to Appellants'\r\n  assertion, this agreement is distinguishable from the agreement in Touchberry v.\r\n    City of Florence,\r\n  295 S.C. 47, 367 S.E.2d 149&nbsp;(1988).Â  In Touchberry, the South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court held that a property owner who had applied to receive water\r\n  service from the City of Florence was a third-party beneficiary of a franchise\r\n  agreement between the Florence County Council and the City of Florence.Â  Id. at 48-49,\r\n  367 S.E.2d at 150.Â \r\n  The agreement granted the City of Florence the exclusive right to provide water\r\n  service in a municipal service area (MSA) in which the plaintiff's property was\r\n  located.Â  The agreement required the City of Florence to provide water service\r\n  in the MSA whenever individually requested, conditioned only upon it being physically\r\n  and economically feasible to do so.Â  It was uncontested that it was feasible\r\n  for the City to provide the service to the plaintiff.Â  Therefore, the Court\r\n  reversed the circuit court's finding that the plaintiff's property had to be\r\n  annexed in order to receive service under the City's agreement with Florence\r\n  County Council.Â  Id. at 48-49, 367 S.E.2d at 149-50. Â \r\nIn\r\n  a later opinion, Sloan v. City of\r\n    Conway, 347 S.C. 324, 555 S.E.2d\r\n  684&nbsp;(2001), the Court expounded on its analysis in Touchberry and noted that there is nothing in the Touchberry opinion holding generally\r\n  that a city cannot require annexation as a contractual condition for water\r\n  service.Â  Sloan, 347 S.C. at 333, 555 S.E.2d at 688.Â  The Court\r\n  explained that, in Touchberry, the City of Florence could not require\r\n  annexation as a condition for providing water service because the customers\r\n  were already entitled to municipal water service as third-party beneficiaries\r\n  of the agreement between the City and the service authority in the disputed\r\n  area.Â  Id. at 332, 555 S.E.2d at 688.\r\nHere, the unconditional obligation to provide water service\r\n  applies only to those taps in existence at the time of the agreement's\r\n  execution.Â  As to any\r\n  additions made to the system after the agreement's execution, the agreement\r\n  expressly conditions\r\n  the obligation to provide service based on the prevailing rules,\r\n  regulations, policies, and approval of the Greenville Water System.Â  A new tap\r\n  qualifies as an addition to the water system even if it is connected to a water\r\n  line that was in existence at the time of the agreement's execution.Â  See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 14 (11th ed. 2003) (defining\r\n  &quot;addition&quot; as &quot;a part added (as to a building or residential\r\n  section)&quot;).Â  When the Greenville Water System adopted the annexation\r\n  policy in 2002, that policy became part of the prevailing policies to which future\r\n  additions to the water system would be subjected.Â  Therefore, the 1971\r\n  agreement authorizes the imposition of the annexation covenant requirement on new\r\n  tap requests submitted after the requirement's adoption.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlawful\r\n  Discrimination\r\nAppellants\r\n  also argue that the annexation covenant requirement unlawfully discriminates\r\n  between owners of District properties within the one-mile radius of the City\r\n  and owners of District properties outside of the one-mile radius.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nParagraphs VI(d), VII, and IX of the\r\n  agreement require the Greenville Water System to treat District customers the\r\n  same as customers in other areas outside the City.Â  Further, paragraph VI(d)\r\n  arguably requires equal treatment of all customers within the District with\r\n  regard to the rates charged for water service.Â  However, nothing in the\r\n  agreement prohibits different classifications within the District's service\r\n  area for purposes of rules or policies other than ratemaking.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution allow for disparate treatment of different classes as\r\n  long as the classification is a reasonable one and is rationally related to a\r\n  legitimate purpose.Â  See Sloan\r\n    v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 480, 636 S.E.2d 598, 613&nbsp;(2006); State v. Solomon, 245 S.C. 550, 572, 141 S.E.2d 818, 830&nbsp;(1965); Town\r\n      of Iva ex rel. Zoning Adm'r v. Holley, 374 S.C. 537, 541, 649 S.E.2d 108, 110-11&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007).\r\n  Â The City's use of a one-mile radius as a determining factor for\r\n  potential annexation is rationally related to the City's goal of managed\r\n  growth.Â  Therefore, the annexation covenant requirement does not unlawfully\r\n  discriminate between different classes of owners of District properties.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court properly granted\r\n  summary judgment to the City. Â There is no genuine issue\r\n  as to any material fact, and the Greenville Water System is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law concerning the application of the provisions of the\r\n  1971 agreement to the annexation covenant requirement.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit\r\n  court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., and PIEPER,\r\nJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants\r\n  named the City of Greenville (City) and the members of Greenville's City\r\n  Council as defendants.Â  The Greenville Water System is a municipal entity\r\nseparately constituted from Greenville's City Council.Â  \r\n[2] The covenant\r\n  authorizes annexation of the subject property whenever it otherwise qualifies\r\nfor annexation under state law, subject to City Council's approval.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4513","title":"Pringle v.

Â Bessie\r\n  sued for negligence, and Burdy brought a claim for loss of consortium.\r\nIn her deposition, Bessie testified that\r\n  she did not notice anything wrong with the chair before it collapsed and that\r\n  the chair was not &quot;rickety,&quot; &quot;wobbly,&quot; or otherwise\r\n  unstable.Â  She did not see the chair after she fell and could not testify as to\r\n  how it broke; however, she maintained the legs of the chair had broken.Â  In\r\n  addition, Bessie had never experienced any problems with chairs during previous\r\n  visits to the Knights Inn and had no direct knowledge of any other patrons who\r\n  had experienced problems with the chairs at the restaurant.Â  Bessie claimed,\r\n  however, a Knights Inn employee approached her a few weeks after the incident\r\n  and told her that an elderly woman fell and hurt herself at the restaurant when\r\n  a chair collapsed.Â  During her deposition, after viewing three photographs of\r\n  different chairs provided by Knights Inn's attorney, Bessie testified the chair\r\n  in which she was sitting when she fell appeared to look like the chairs in the\r\n  photographs.[1]\r\nBurdy\r\n  also testified in his deposition that there was no indication of any problem\r\n  with the chairs at their table and that he was not directly aware of any\r\n  problems with chairs at Knights Inn.Â  Burdy identified one of the chairs in the\r\n  photographs as the same type of chair that collapsed under Bessie.Â  According\r\n  to Burdy, the chair was in two separate pieces after it collapsed and the\r\n  right-side legs of the chair were completely loose and broken from the base of\r\n  the seat.Â  Burdy also claimed Bhupen Patel, the owner and manager of the\r\n  restaurant, asked him to pass the chair to him immediately following the\r\n  incident.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Pringles named Angus McDuffie as an expert witness in the case.Â  McDuffie has\r\n  no degrees or specialized training; however, he has been in the furniture\r\n  business for forty years, selling both commercial and residential furniture and\r\n  repairing broken furniture.Â  In his deposition, McDuffie testified about the\r\n  difference between residential and commercial chairs, explaining the two types\r\n  are different in construction.Â  According to McDuffie, the legs on commercial\r\n  chairs cannot be removed from the structure of the chair because the leg system\r\n  &quot;is an integral part of the seating system&quot; where the legs are\r\n  mounted directly into the seat itself, creating one single unit.Â  In contrast,\r\n  McDuffie testified residential chairs have separate leg and seat units that\r\n  operate independently of one another and the legs are attached to a rail on the\r\n  bottom of a seat rather than into the seat itself; thus, all of the stress on\r\n  the seat is absorbed at the point where the legs attach.Â  McDuffie opined that commercial\r\n  chairs are different from residential chairs in their ability to withstand\r\n  greater frequency of use and that residential chairs are not substantial enough\r\n  for use in a commercial setting. Â \r\nAfter\r\n  viewing the photographs of the chairs, McDuffie stated the chairs in the\r\n  pictures were residential chairs unfit for use in a commercial setting.Â  According\r\n  to McDuffie, the chairs could not sustain &quot;heavy general use without\r\n  causing some type of failure of the back or leg support system.&quot;Â  McDuffie\r\n  explained that over time and frequency of use, such chairs would show signs of\r\n  wear, indicated by wobbliness, weakness, loss of parts, squeaking, and screws\r\n  coming out.Â  Furthermore, McDuffie indicated an inadequate chair would show\r\n  signs of being shaky and loose and a chair without such signs would not\r\n  indicate wear from frequency of use.Â  Without inspecting the subject chair,\r\n  McDuffie could not give an opinion as to whether it collapsed because of frequency\r\n  of use or sudden failure.Â  \r\nMcDuffie\r\n  also indicated commercial and residential chairs would appear the same to the\r\n  untrained eye and purchasers would not know a chair was for residential use\r\n  unless the seller informed them.Â  McDuffie indicated some residential chairs\r\n  are stamped with a notice that the chair is for residential use; however, he\r\n  had no opinion as to whether the manufacturer of the chair involved in Bessie's\r\n  fall told the buyer the chairs were for residential use only.Â  He also stated\r\n  he had not examined the particular chair involved in the incident and therefore\r\n  could not state whether it contained such a stamp. \r\nPatel\r\n  testified in deposition that maintenance is performed at Knights Inn on\r\n  Saturdays.Â  He further noted there are three types of chairs at the Knights Inn.Â \r\n  Some of the chairs came with the restaurant when he bought it, and others he\r\n  purchased later.Â  Patel could not say whether or not the subject chair was one\r\n  he purchased.Â  Patel also testified that after the subject chair collapsed, the\r\n  legs were separated from the chair, and he immediately removed it.Â  He never\r\n  saw the chair again, and it never occurred to him to save the chair in\r\n  anticipation of a lawsuit.Â  Patel also confirmed the subject chair was the same\r\n  as the chairs depicted in the photographs, which encompassed all three types of\r\n  chairs at the Knights Inn.Â  According to Patel, the chairs at the Knights Inn\r\n  all have screws connecting the legs to rails at the base of the seat.Â  Patel\r\n  admitted another incident occurred prior to Bessie's fall when a chair broke at\r\n  the Knights Inn; however, he claimed the person sitting in the chair was\r\n  extremely heavy and did not fall.Â  He also acknowledged the subject chair was\r\n  the only other chair he had taken out of use. \r\nFollowing\r\n  discovery, Knights Inn made a motion for summary judgment, arguing the Pringles\r\n  failed to offer evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding its\r\n  negligence.Â  The Pringles contended summary judgment was inappropriate because\r\n  the evidence showed the chairs used by the restaurant were not fit for\r\n  commercial use.Â  Additionally, the Pringles made a motion for sanctions against\r\n  Knights Inn for spoliation of evidence, arguing: (1) summary judgment was\r\n  inappropriate because Knights Inn disposed of the subject chair; and (2) the\r\n  Pringles were entitled to an inference that the subject chair would have been\r\n  adverse to the position of Knights Inn.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted summary judgment on both causes of action, concluding the\r\n  Pringles failed to offer any evidence that Knights Inn knew the subject chair\r\n  was defective or in a dangerous condition.Â  Furthermore, the court found\r\n  there was no evidence showing either that Knights Inn knew the subject chair\r\n  was for residential use only or that the use of residential chairs instead of\r\n  commercial chairs would constitute negligence.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the trial court ruled there was no evidence of spoliation that would defeat\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Though the trial court noted an inference may be drawn that the\r\n  lost or destroyed chair would have been adverse to Knights Inn's case, it\r\n  concluded there was already evidence the subject chair was defective and\r\n  summary judgment was still appropriate because the Pringles failed to offer\r\n  evidence Knights Inn knew or should have known the chair was defective.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nWas\r\n  the grant of summary judgment to Knights Inn proper in view of (1) evidence presented\r\n  by the Pringles that the chair in question was of residential rather than\r\n  commercial quality, and (2) the fact that the chair was not available for their\r\n  inspection during this lawsuit?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion, this court applies the same standard of review as the circuit court\r\n  under Rule 56, SCRCP. Â Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d\r\n  437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005).&nbsp; Summary judgment\r\n  is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â To\r\n  determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing court must\r\n  consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable\r\n  to the non-moving party. Â Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434,\r\n  629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Creation of an unreasonably\r\n  dangerous condition\r\nThe\r\n  Pringles first argue the grant of summary judgment was error because the trial\r\n  court focused solely on whether Patel knew or should have known of the unsafe\r\n  condition allegedly created by the chair in which Bessie was sitting when she\r\n  fell.Â  Citing Cook v. Food Lion, 328 S.C. 324, 491 S.E.2d 690 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997), the Pringles argue the court should have considered the principle that,\r\n  in a premises liability case, if the defendant created the allegedly dangerous\r\n  condition, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to show the defendant had\r\n  prior actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition.Â  Cook,\r\n  328 S.C. at 327-28, 491 S.E.2d 691-92. Â We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  recover damages for injuries caused by a dangerous or defective condition on a\r\n  defendant's premises, a plaintiff &quot;must show either (1) that the injury\r\n  was caused by a specific act of the respondent which created the dangerous\r\n  condition; or (2) that the respondent had actual or constructive knowledge of\r\n  the dangerous condition and failed to remedy it.&quot;Â  Anderson v Racetrac\r\n    Petroleum, Inc., 296 S.C. 204, 205, 371 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1988).\r\nIn Cook,\r\n  the plaintiff claimed a wrinkled mat placed by the defendant's employees on the\r\n  floor for its customers caused her to fall and suffer injury.Â  During the\r\n  trial, she proffered testimony from several of the defendant's employees that\r\n  the floor mats used in the store had a tendency to wrinkle, had to be\r\n  straightened, and caused people to trip and stumble on several occasions.Â \r\n  Ultimately, this Court held the trial judge erred in directing a verdict for\r\n  the defendant because the tendency of the mats to wrinkle created a dangerous\r\n  condition and the defendant was aware of the tendency even though it may not\r\n  have been aware the particular mat in question was in fact wrinkled immediately\r\n  before the plaintiff fell on it.Â  Cook, 328 S.C. at 329, 491 S.E.2d at\r\n  692. Â The showing that a defendant created a condition that led to a plaintiff's\r\n  injury is not, however, sufficient to survive a summary judgment motion unless there\r\n  is evidence that in creating the condition, the defendant acted negligently. Â See Shain v. Leiserv, Inc., 328 S.C. 574, 576, 493 S.E.2d 111, 112 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997) (stating the evidence required to show a condition created by the\r\n  defendant was indeed hazardous must show the defendant was negligent either in\r\n  the choice of materials used to create the condition or in the manner of their\r\n  application).\r\nApplying\r\n  these principles to the present case, we agree with the trial court that the\r\n  Pringles did not present evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact that Knights Inn was negligent in placing residential quality\r\n  chairs in the restaurant.Â  Although McDuffie opined that residential chairs\r\n  like the ones used in the restaurant are not substantial enough for use in a\r\n  commercial setting because they cannot sustain heavy general use, he never\r\n  stated that a residential chair in and of itself is a dangerous condition.Â \r\n  Moreover, although McDuffie stated residential chairs &quot;could not withstand\r\n  heavy general use,&quot; he explained that this was because, over time, they would\r\n  begin to show signs of wear, such as being wobbly or weak with loss of parts or\r\n  screws coming out.Â  Bessie's own testimony that the chair in which she was\r\n  sitting when she fell was not unstable supports the trial court's finding that\r\n  there was no evidence that Knights Inn knew or should have known that the chair\r\n  was in danger of collapse or other failure.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Spoliation\r\nThe Pringles also\r\n  argue they are entitled to an inference that, because the chair in question was\r\n  lost or destroyed by Knights Inn, it would have been adverse to Knights Inn's\r\n  case.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Kershaw\r\n  County Board of Education v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 302 S.C. 390, 394, 396 S.E.2d\r\n  369, 372 (1990), the supreme court upheld a jury charge that &quot;when\r\n  evidence is lost or destroyed by a party an inference may be drawn by the jury\r\n  that the evidence which was lost or destroyed by that party would have been\r\n  adverse to that party.&quot;Â  As an initial matter, however, the party seeking\r\n  the inference &quot;must be prepared to make a showing that the document or\r\n  evidence might reasonably have supported whatever presumption is being\r\n  requested of the fact finder.&quot;Â  Kevin Eberle, Spoliation in South\r\n    Carolina, S.C. Law., Sept. 2007, 26, 32.Â  Here, in view of the evidence\r\n  already presented, the chair in question would not have provided any additional\r\n  information indicating that its use at the restaurant would have constituted\r\n  negligence on the part of Knights Inn.Â  Bessie's own testimony established\r\n  there was no indication the chair was wobbly, weak, unstable, or otherwise\r\n  defective immediately prior to its collapse.Â  Furthermore, although the\r\n  Pringles suggested the chair may have been stamped with a disclaimer indicating\r\n  it was for residential use, they failed to provide any evidence that such a\r\n  stamp was in fact on the chair.Â  Although McDuffie testified that some\r\n  residential chairs include a stamped disclaimer, it was undisputed that any\r\n  chair, whether or not it was classified as a residential chair or stamped as\r\n  such, would show signs of wear before collapsing and that there was no\r\n  indication that any such signs were apparent in the chair in question.Â  We\r\n  therefore hold that any inference that a jury could make from the absence of\r\n  the chair would not change the fact that there was no indication the chair was\r\n  dangerous or unfit for use.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe agree\r\n  with the trial court that the Pringles did not present a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to whether the use of a residential chair in a commercial\r\n  establishment, without more, constitutes evidence of negligence on the part of\r\n  the owner of the establishment.Â  To hold otherwise would be directly at odds\r\n  with the applicable standard of care that &quot;[a] merchant is not an insurer\r\n  of the safety of his customer but owes only the duty of exercising ordinary\r\n  care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition.&quot;Â  Garvin v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 343 S.C. 625, 628, 541 S.E.2d 831, 832 (2001). Â We also uphold\r\n  the trial court's determination that, because there was no evidence that\r\n  Knights Inn knew or should have known the chair would collapse, the doctrine of\r\n  spoliation did not preclude the grant of summary judgment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The photographs were not included in the record on\r\n  appeal; however, it appears from counselâ€™s remarks during the deposition that\r\n  the only difference among the chairs depicted in the photographs was that one\r\n  of them had white paint on the back and the other two were of a solid wood\r\n  color.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
