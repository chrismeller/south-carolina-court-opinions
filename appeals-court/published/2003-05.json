Kirkman Moorhead, of Anderson; for Appellants.\r\nG. Dewey Oxner, Jr., J. Ben Alexander, of Greenville; for \r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Ernest Steve McClain and Linda \r\n  McClain appeal the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Frank \r\n  E. Oliver, M.D. and Anderson Neurological Associates, P.A.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nMr. McClain was hospitalized for surgery \r\n  related to diverticulitis; Dr. John Jarrard, an anesthesiologist, inserted a \r\n  lumbar epidural catheter for post-operative pain control.Â  After surgery, McClain \r\n  experienced growing numbness in his legs and stomach and the inability to move \r\n  his lower body.Â  Based on a CT scan and a myelogram ordered by Dr. Oliver, the \r\n  consulting neurosurgeon, surgery was done to remove an epidural hematoma caused \r\n  by the catheter piercing a blood vessel.Â  \r\nDuring his deposition, an expert witness, \r\n  Dr. Thomas A. Duc, opined that Dr. Oliverâ€™s failure to act aggressively contributed \r\n  to McClainâ€™s resulting injuries.Â  Based on this testimony, McClain amended his \r\n  complaint to add Dr. Oliver and his practice, Anderson Neurological Associates \r\n  (Anderson) as defendants.Â  In their answer, Dr. Oliver and Anderson asserted \r\n  the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations and moved for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  The trial court granted the motion. \r\nMcClain argues that the statute of limitations \r\n  did not begin to run on his cause of action against Dr. Oliver until he was \r\n  aware of facts sufficient to put him on notice that Dr. Oliver had done something \r\n  wrong.Â  We disagree.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œUnder the discovery rule, the statute does not \r\n  run from the date of the negligent act, but from the date when the injury \r\n  resulting from the wrongful conduct either is discovered or may be discovered \r\n  by the exercise of reasonable diligence.â€Â  Wilson v. Shannon, 299 S.C. \r\n  512, 513, 386 S.E.2d 257, 258 (Ct. App. 1989) (emphasis added).Â  In the medical \r\n  malpractice context, our supreme court applied the reasonable diligence analysis \r\n  under the general discovery rule set forth in Snell v. Columbia Gun Exchange, \r\n  276 S.C. 301, 278 S.E.2d 333 (1981).Â  â€œâ€˜[A]n injured party must act with some \r\n  promptness where the facts and circumstances of the injury would put a person \r\n  of common knowledge on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that \r\n  some claim against another party might exist.â€™â€Â  Strong v. Univ. of \r\n  S.C. Sch. of Med., 316 S.C. 189, 191, 447 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1994) (quoting \r\n  Snell at 303, 278 S.E.2d at 334) (emphasis added).Â  While South Carolina \r\n  cases have allowed some latitude for discovery of an injury in the medical malpractice \r\n  context, given the expert knowledge required to ascertain an injury, we find \r\n  no case extending a similar latitude to allow adding additional defendants after \r\n  the statute of limitations has run where the plaintiff clearly knew of his injury.Â  \r\n  In Strong, the court declined to extend the statute where the patient \r\n  clearly should have known the cause of his injury when it was noted in his medical \r\n  records.\r\nThe closest case on point is Tanyel \r\n  v. Osborne, 312 S.C. 473, 441 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  That case arose \r\n  out of an automobile collision at an intersection; based on a witnessâ€™ changed \r\n  recollection about the light, Tanyel sought to add another defendant, arguing \r\n  the statute did not begin to run until he discovered evidence of negligence \r\n  by that defendant.Â  The court rejected this argument, stating: â€œ[t]he success \r\n  or failure of his investigation is irrelevant.Â  Undertaking such an investigation \r\n  demonstrates notice of a potential claim against the [other] driver.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 475, 441 S.E.2d at 331.Â  This court held Tanyelâ€™s witnessing of the other \r\n  driverâ€™s involvement was alone sufficient to put him on notice of a potential \r\n  claim, which triggered the statute of limitations.\r\nWe see no reason to distinguish this case \r\n  from Tanyel, nor are we persuaded that the nature of this caseâ€”medical \r\n  malpracticeâ€”removes it from the limits of common knowledge and experience.Â  \r\n  Significantly, both McClain and his wife testified specifically that Dr. Oliver \r\n  treated him soon after the problem developed and continued to follow up.Â  Dr. \r\n  Oliverâ€™s involvement was known to both of them, and they discussed their concerns \r\n  with him.Â  This is not a case where discovery disclosed the existence of a treating \r\n  doctor not mentioned in the medical records.Â  Rather, McClain had actual knowledge \r\n  of Dr. Oliverâ€™s treatment and that any potential claim could encompass his treatment.Â  \r\n  As we noted in Tanyel, the notice of a potential claim against a different \r\n  defendant â€œtriggered the statute of limitations, rather than the discovery of \r\n  evidence actually supporting the potential claim.â€Â  Tanyel at 476, 441 \r\n  S.E.2d at 331.\r\nOur supreme court refused to extend the statute \r\n  of limitations under the discovery rule in a similar situation where plaintiffs \r\n  chose to consult several lawyers and investigate fully before bringing a medical \r\n  malpractice suit against the doctor.Â  Smith v. Smith, 291 S.C. 420, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 36 (1987).Â  In that case, the Smiths raised concerns about the treatment \r\n  before leaving the hospital and consulted an attorney within days, but did not \r\n  ultimately bring suit until five years later.Â  The court held their earlier \r\n  concerns and consultation were sufficient to trigger the running of the statute \r\n  of limitations.Â  Id. at 425-26, 354 S.E.2d at 39-40.Â  \r\nBecause the McClains sued Dr. Oliver and Anderson \r\n  more than three years after discovery of the injury and after the expiration \r\n  of the statute of limitations, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR, STILWELL, and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3637","title":"Hailey v.

McDow, of Rock Hill, for appellant.\r\nForrest C. Wilkerson, of Rock Hill, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â  Charles Floyd Hailey \r\n  (â€œHusbandâ€) brought this action against his former spouse, Betty Kimbrell Hailey \r\n  (â€œWifeâ€), seeking a downward modification of his alimony obligation.Â  Husband \r\n  asserted a change in circumstances occurred because Wife began receiving monthly \r\n  Social Security benefits after the award of alimony and because income should \r\n  be imputed to her for the substantial appreciation in value of her non-income-producing \r\n  real property.Â  Wife denied a decrease was warranted and counterclaimed for \r\n  an increase in alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Following multiple hearings, the \r\n  family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion for a reduction in alimony, declining to \r\n  impute income to Wife for the appreciation in value of her real property.Â  The \r\n  court granted Wife an increase in alimony and awarded her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  Husband appeals.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe parties were divorced in July of \r\n  1993, after forty-three years of marriage.Â  The divorce decree reserved all \r\n  issues of support and property division for later disposition.Â  After twelve \r\n  hearings, the family court issued its final order on May 23, 1994, dividing \r\n  the marital property and awarding Wife $1,250.00 per month in periodic alimony.Â  \r\n\r\nWife appealed the alimony award to the supreme \r\n  court, and while the appeal was pending, she began receiving Social Security \r\n  benefits, prompting Husbandâ€™s first motion for a reduction in alimony in September \r\n  of 1993.Â  Following a remand from the supreme court to allow the issue to be \r\n  heard, the case was scheduled for hearing on August 3, 1995.Â  At that time, \r\n  however, Husband agreed to dismiss the motion because he believed it was unlikely \r\n  the court would grant a modification.Â  In a consent order, the motion was dismissed, \r\n  and Husband agreed to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nIn 1997, Husband again brought an action to reduce \r\n  his alimony obligation, contending Wifeâ€™s 1994 increase in income from Social \r\n  Security and other sources, along with her substantial increase in net worth \r\n  from the appreciation of non-income-producing real property, were sufficient \r\n  changes in circumstances to justify an alimony reduction.Â Â  \r\nWife denied a reduction was warranted \r\n  and counterclaimed for an increase in alimony on the grounds that she was unable \r\n  to maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  \r\nThe family court, Judge William R. Byers, \r\n  Jr., conducted multiple hearings.Â  However, Judge Byers retired before making \r\n  a decision, leading to a substantial delay, and the necessity of re-trying the \r\n  issues. To expedite the process, the parties reached certain factual stipulations \r\n  concerning their original economic circumstances and their circumstances as \r\n  of 1998.Â  \r\nThe parties agreed the relevant time period for \r\n  purposes of determining the cross-motions was between May 23, 1994, the date \r\n  of the original award, and March 31, 1998, the date the motion for modification \r\n  was first heard by Judge Byers.Â  Therefore, although a substantial time has \r\n  passed, we confine our review to this stipulated time period.Â  The parties also \r\n  stipulated to their net worth on May 23, 1994 and as of March 31, 1998.Â  According \r\n  to the stipulation, Wifeâ€™s net worth had increased from $662,796.00 to $849,919.99, \r\n  and Husbandâ€™s net worth had increased from $733,010.00 to $988,414.00.Â  \r\nFollowing a hearing, the family court, \r\n  Judge Robert E. Guess, found a change of circumstances had occurred.Â  Thus, \r\n  he increased Wifeâ€™s alimony award from $1,250.00 to $1,675.00 per month, citing \r\n  the following reasons: 1) Wifeâ€™s age; 2) the deterioration of Wifeâ€™s physical \r\n  and emotional health; 3) the deterioration of Wifeâ€™s personal residence; and \r\n  4) Wifeâ€™s decreased standard of living.Â  Additionally, Judge Guess concluded \r\n  Wifeâ€™s real estate holdings were less marketable than Husband contended, and \r\n  he refused to impute income to Wife for them.Â  Furthermore, because Wife prevailed \r\n  on her motion, and after considering the appropriate factors, Judge Guess awarded \r\n  Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nâ€œQuestions concerning alimony rest with the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed absent \r\n  a showing of abuse of discretion.â€Â  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, \r\n  535 S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is \r\n  controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon factual findings, \r\n  is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œHowever, an appellate court reviewing \r\n  a family court order may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.â€Â  Sharps, 342 S.C. at 79, 535 S.E.2d at 917.Â  â€œ[W]hen \r\n  an appellate court chooses to find facts in accordance with its own view of \r\n  the evidence, the court must state distinctly its findings of fact and the reason \r\n  for its decision.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  367, 369 (2002).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Husbandâ€™s Motion to Decrease Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by denying his \r\n  motion to decrease alimony.Â  He contends the original decree required the family \r\n  court to decrease alimony when Wife began receiving Social Security benefits.Â  \r\n  He also asserts a decrease is warranted because the evidence shows her income \r\n  increased over the applicable period and income should have been imputed to \r\n  her for the non-income-producing real properties she owns.Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Judicial Estoppel\r\nAs a threshold matter, Wife argues Husbandâ€™s claim \r\n  to decrease alimony is barred by judicial estoppel.Â  We conclude this issue \r\n  is not preserved for review. \r\nAfter Wife began receiving Social Security \r\n  in August of 1994, Husband moved for a decrease in alimony. Before the scheduled \r\n  hearing, Husband agreed to dismiss the motion because he believed, given the \r\n  relative financial positions of both parties, relief was unlikely.Â  \r\nIn 1996, Husband brought another action requesting \r\n  a reduction that was again dismissed without prejudice.Â  \r\nIn 1997, Husband brought the current motion \r\n  to modify the alimony award.Â  In her answer, Wife raised res judicata as a defense \r\n  based upon the orders dismissing the previous motions.Â  However, the record \r\n  does not reflect Wife raised judicial estoppel as a bar to this modification \r\n  action.Â  Furthermore, the family court, Judge Guess, did not rule on this issue.Â  \r\n\r\nIn Noisette v. Ismail, our supreme \r\n  court held issues not raised to and ruled on by the trial judge were not preserved \r\n  for review by an appellate court.Â  304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991); \r\n  see Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 704 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001)Â  (holding issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must \r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate \r\n  review).Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Reduction based upon wording of the divorce \r\n  decree\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by \r\n  denying his motion to decrease alimony because the original divorce decree required \r\n  a reduction once Wife began receiving Social Security benefits.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe original divorce decree contained the following \r\n  language:\r\n\r\nâ€œ[A]limony will be reviewable upon the Wife attaining \r\n  the age of sixty-five (65) years or otherwise being able to draw on . . . [Husbandâ€™s] \r\n  social security and [his] Medicare coverage.Â  These will be substantial changes \r\n  in circumstances for the alimony to be modified.â€\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nâ€œAs a general rule, judgments are to be construed like other \r\n  written instruments.â€ Eddins v. Eddins, 304 S.C. 133, 135, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  164, 166 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œThe determinative factor is the intention of the \r\n  court, as gathered, not from an isolated part thereof, but from all parts of \r\n  the judgment itself.â€ Id.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n order should be construed \r\n  within the context of the proceeding in which it is rendered.â€ Dibble v. \r\n  Sumter Ice &amp; Fuel Company, 283 S.C. 278, 282, 322 S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984).\r\nThis Court has noted that, â€œ[g]enerally, changes in \r\n  circumstances within the contemplation of the parties at the time the decree \r\n  was entered do not provide a basis for modifying either an alimony allowance \r\n  or a child support award.â€ Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 139, 336 \r\n  S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  However, in applying this general rule, the \r\n  family court should look not only at whether the parties contemplated the change, \r\n  but also â€œmost importantly whether the amount of alimony in the original decree \r\n  reflects the expectation of that future occurrence.â€ Sharps, 342 S.C. \r\n  at 78, 535 S.E.2d at 917.Â  Moreover, as our supreme court noted, â€œThere are \r\n  some future changes which may be in contemplation of the parties at the time \r\n  of the decree but, due to other considerations, cannot be addressed at that \r\n  time in the divorce decree.â€ Id. at 77, 336 S.E.2d at 916.\r\nThe family court noted the imminent increase in Wifeâ€™s \r\n  income from the onset of Social Security benefits in the divorce decree.Â  This \r\n  provision in the order makes it clear that Social Security benefits were not \r\n  factored into the original alimony award.Â  Just as clearly, the family court \r\n  did not attempt to allocate a reduction in alimony based on this future event. \r\n  Â Rather, the original order stated alimony was reviewable once this event \r\n  occurred.\r\nThe family court, Judge Guess, found Wifeâ€™s income \r\n  was inadequate to pay her monthly expenses, even considering her Social Security \r\n  benefits.Â  Her 1998 income was $2,297.00 per month, including her $564.00 per \r\n  month Social Security benefit, leaving her with a deficit of $489.00 per month.Â  \r\n  Based on Husbandâ€™s financial declaration, his income grew from $5,374.00 per \r\n  month to $11,507.00 per month, [1]  and, using his figures, he still had a monthly \r\n  surplus of $845.00.Â  Both parties grew in net worth, Husband greater than Wife.Â  \r\n  In relation to each other, their financial positions remained relatively stable, \r\n  although the court concluded Wife had reduced her standard of living to remain \r\n  within her income.Â  Thus, based on all of the changes of circumstances that \r\n  occurred, or lack thereof, between the parties, the family court declined to \r\n  reduce Wifeâ€™s alimony.Â  \r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s conclusion that the \r\n  original order did not mandate a reduction in alimony when Wife began receiving \r\n  Social Security benefits.Â  Furthermore, the family court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  by reviewing all of the changes in circumstances in evaluating whether or not \r\n  a modification in alimony was warranted.Â  See id. at 79, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  at 917 (holding in evaluating a change in circumstances, the court must determine \r\n  if the change warrants a modification of alimony, and in doing so, must consider \r\n  all of the changes in circumstances that have occurred). \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Income and Net Worth Increase\r\nHusband argues that, even if the original alimony \r\n  award did not mandate a decrease once Social Security payments began, the family \r\n  court erred by denying his motion to reduce alimony because Wifeâ€™s income substantially \r\n  increased during the applicable period.Â  In this regard, Husband asserts the \r\n  family court failed to impute income to Wife for non-marital-real-estate assets \r\n  that have appreciated in value by $148,000.00 since the divorce.Â  Although we \r\n  agree Wifeâ€™s increase in net worth should not have been excluded from consideration \r\n  for the reasons advanced by the family court, we disagree with the argument \r\n  that income should be imputed to her warranting a decrease in alimony.\r\nOnce a periodic alimony obligation is set, South Carolina \r\n  Code Annotated section 20-3-170 (1985) governs modification of the obligation.Â  \r\n  Section 20-3-170 states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nWhenever [a spouse] . . . has been required to make \r\n  his or her spouse any periodic payments of alimony and the circumstances \r\n  of the parties or the financial ability of the spouse making the periodic payments \r\n  shall have changed since the rendition of the judgment, either party may \r\n  apply to the court which rendered the judgment for an order and judgment decreasing \r\n  or increasing the amount of such alimony payments or terminating such payments \r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nFurthermore, the burden of showing by the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence a change has occurred is on the party seeking the modification. \r\n  Cartee v. Cartee, 295 S.C. 103, 104, 366 S.E.2d 269, 269 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nDuring the marriage, Wife inherited real \r\n  property in Rock Hill (â€œthe Rock Hill propertyâ€) and Fort Mill (â€œthe Fort Mill \r\n  propertyâ€) from her mother.Â  She jointly owns the Rock Hill property with four \r\n  other people, and, according to her testimony, she does not control it.Â  \r\nShe and her two sisters inherited adjoining twenty-three \r\n  acre tracts of land in Fort Mill.Â  According to Wife, she and her sisters verbally \r\n  agreed not to sell their tracts until all three could be sold, so that the proceeds \r\n  could be equally divided.Â  Although offers had been made to buy the property \r\n  as a whole, and Wife had agreed to sell her portion, her sisters had declined, \r\n  believing the offers to be inadequate.Â  \r\nWife stipulated the value of these two properties had \r\n  increased by $148,000.00 since 1994 to a 1998 value of $406,000.00.Â  Husbandâ€™s \r\n  accountant testified Wife could have earned $8,983.00 per year from the properties \r\n  based on their value in 1993, $12,982.00 per year from the proceeds if she sold \r\n  the properties in 1998, or $18,371.00 per year if she exchanged the properties \r\n  for rental properties.Â  \r\nThe family court declined to impute income \r\n  to Wife based on these properties for two reasons.Â  First, the court concluded \r\n  Wife made a wise decision by not selling the properties in 1993, noting that \r\n  the properties had appreciated in value significantly more than the combined \r\n  total of the foreseeable income that could have been derived by conservatively \r\n  investing the proceeds.Â  Second, the court concluded the properties were not \r\n  nearly as marketable as Husbandâ€™s accountant portrayed them to be.Â  \r\nWe disagree with the family courtâ€™s analysis as to \r\n  both issues.Â  South Carolina Code Annotated section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2002) \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nIn making an award of alimony or separate maintenance \r\n  and support, the court must consider and give weight in such proportion as it \r\n  finds appropriate to all of the following factors . . . (8) the marital and \r\n  nonmarital properties of the parties, including those apportioned to him or \r\n  her in the divorce or separate maintenance action.\r\n\r\nWife owned the two subject properties at the time of \r\n  the equitable distribution.Â  Thus, when the family court determined the original \r\n  alimony award, it presumably considered the impact that the two properties, \r\n  and their reasonable appreciation, would have on Wifeâ€™s financial condition.Â  \r\n  Therefore, absent an extraordinary event affecting the original value of these \r\n  assets, the imputation of income, for purposes of determining a change of circumstances, \r\n  would be an unfair duplication.Â  See Calvert, 287 S.C. at 139, \r\n  336 S.E.2d at 889 (â€œGenerally, changes in circumstances within the contemplation \r\n  of the parties at the time the decree was entered do not provide a basis for \r\n  modifying either an alimony allowance or a child support award.â€); see also \r\n  Gay v. Gay, 800 A.2d 1231, 1240 (Conn. App. Ct. 2002) (holding the appreciation \r\n  in value of an asset â€œdistributed at the time of the dissolution does not constitute \r\n  a change in circumstances that the court may consider when deciding whether \r\n  to entertain a motion for modification of alimony.Â  Furthermore, . . . [it] \r\n  cannot be used as a factor to determine the amount by which alimony is to be \r\n  modified.â€); cf. Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, 374, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  413, 417 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting, where Wife received property after the equitable \r\n  distribution, the family court erred by refusing to consider the property when \r\n  determining whether an alimony modification was warranted because â€œeven if Husband \r\n  knew before the partiesâ€™ divorce that Wife would likely receive an inheritance \r\n  on the deaths of her mother and aunt, the parties could not have ascertained \r\n  the amount of Wifeâ€™s inheritances or when she would receive them.â€Â  Thus, the \r\n  property could not have been considered by the family court in the equitable \r\n  distribution.â€).\r\nAs to the marketability of the properties, the family \r\n  court stated â€œ[t]here is nothing in the records which would lead me to believe \r\n  that the wife has the ability to convert this property without significantly \r\n  more expense than has been allowed by the husbandâ€™s witnesses.â€Â  \r\nThe parties stipulated to the value of Wifeâ€™s properties \r\n  for purposes of this proceeding.Â  With the possible exception of Wifeâ€™s comment \r\n  that she did not control the Fort Mill property, she does not argue, and offers \r\n  no proof, that the properties have less value than that to which she stipulated.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the record does not support the family courtâ€™s finding, and we conclude \r\n  it is an abuse of discretion.\r\nNotwithstanding this determination, we conclude Husband \r\n  failed to prove that a reduction in alimony is warranted.Â  First, no evidence \r\n  was presented to establish the appreciation in these assets was extraordinary \r\n  over the stipulated period.Â  In fact, Husbandâ€™s assets increased in value by \r\n  $255,404.00 during the same period, approximately the same percentage increase \r\n  as that of Wife.Â  \r\nThe family court concluded Wife managed to increase \r\n  the value of her assets by allowing them to appreciate, rather than converting \r\n  them into cash and spending the income.Â  This conclusion is supported by the \r\n  testimony.Â  The family court also concluded that Wife had a monthly deficit \r\n  of $489.00, a finding that is also borne out by the record.Â  Therefore, even \r\n  if income were imputable for the $148,000.00 increase in value of these assets, \r\n  [2]  the additional income would not make up the deficit the family court \r\n  found to exist.Â  Thus, we hold no substantial change in circumstances has occurred \r\n  such that an alimony reduction is warranted.Â  See Calvert, 287 \r\n  S.C. at 138, 336 S.E.2d at 888 (holding to warrant an alimony modification, \r\n  the change of circumstances must be either substantial or material).Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Wifeâ€™s Motion to Increase Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family court \r\n  erred by increasing Wifeâ€™s alimony award.Â  We agree.\r\nTo support her assertion of a change of circumstances \r\n  warranting an increase in alimony, Wife testified her standard of living has \r\n  declined over the applicable period.Â  She opined she is â€œprobably manic-depressive,â€ \r\n  she does not think she is capable of working, and she â€œprobably need[s]â€ psychological \r\n  assistance.Â  At the time of the hearing, she was taking Ronase; Vasotec, a blood \r\n  pressure medication; Miacalcin, a bone density medication; and Atrooent, an \r\n  inhaler.Â  In March of 1998, these medications cost her between $175.00 and $225.00 \r\n  per month.Â  She also testified she had a â€œprotruding toothâ€ as of the date of \r\n  hearing.Â  \r\nIn support of her assertion that her standard of \r\n  living had decreased, she testified her home needed painting and new interior \r\n  furnishings.Â  She also testified the exterior needed work.Â  Furthermore, she \r\n  provided a list of needed, allegedly unaffordable, household repairs, including \r\n  everything from new upholstery and appliances to tree removal, although no cost \r\n  estimates were included.Â  \r\nThe trial court concluded this evidence established \r\n  a change in circumstances warranting an increase in alimony.Â  We disagree with \r\n  this conclusion.\r\nWifeâ€™s casual description of her own medical condition \r\n  is unconvincing, especially in light of the total failure of proof as to any \r\n  impact upon her income or economic circumstances.Â  Additionally, Wife provided \r\n  no evidence her medication expense increased after the initial award of alimony.Â  \r\n  Cf. Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 \r\n  (1997) (finding no abuse of discretion by award of increased alimony when relatively \r\n  young wife had ongoing severe medical condition hampering her earning capability \r\n  and husbandâ€™s standard of living had continued to increase since initial award). \r\n  Furthermore, she stipulated she had no unusual or extraordinary expenses.Â  \r\nMoreover, we do not agree any deterioration to \r\n  Wifeâ€™s residence warrants an increase.Â  Wifeâ€™s testimony reveals that the only \r\n  two expenses arising after the original award of alimony involve yard work and \r\n  repairs needed to a storage building. She admitted the remainder of the deterioration \r\n  pre-dated the stipulated time period.Â  We simply cannot agree the need for yard \r\n  work and repair to a storage shed constitutes a change in circumstances warranting \r\n  an increase in alimony, especially in view of Wifeâ€™s stipulated net worth, which \r\n  includes liquid assets in excess of $180,000.00. \r\nReviewing the record as a whole, we conclude Wife has failed to demonstrate \r\n  a decline in her standard of living such that an alimony increase is warranted.Â  \r\n  Under the family courtâ€™s findings, her income has increased, her net worth has \r\n  increased, and her expenses have decreased.Â  Therefore, we reverse the award \r\n  of an increase in alimony.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the trial court \r\n  erred by granting Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe award of attorney's fees is within the discretion \r\n  of the court.Â  Skipper v. Skipper, 290 S.C. 412, 414, 351 S.E.2d 153, \r\n  154 (1986).Â Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should \r\n  consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fee; the beneficial results \r\n  obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and \r\n  the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., \r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nHusband brought this action to reduce \r\n  his alimony obligation.Â  Wife has successfully defended against this action.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Wifeâ€™s monthly income is less than her expenses, and Husbandâ€™s \r\n  income is significantly more than his expenses.Â  Thus, we conclude Judge Guessâ€™ \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fee award to Wife was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the family court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHULER, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Although we recognize the 1994 figure is net of expenses associated \r\n    with the rental properties, and the 1998 income is a gross figure, Husband \r\n    did not present financial evidence to aid the court in interpreting the 1998 \r\n    figure.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Husbandâ€™s accountant opined Wife could have earned $8,983.00 per \r\n    year in interest, in 1993, by investing the original value of these assets \r\n    in conservative investments, and $12,982.00 per year, in 1998, based upon \r\n    the increased value.

Pachak of SC Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  The Charleston County Grand \r\n  Jury true-billed an indictment against Delbert Smalls for second-degree lynching.Â  \r\n  When the case was called to trial, he pled guilty to assault and battery of \r\n  a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) rather than the lynching charge. [1] Â  The trial court accepted the \r\n  guilty plea and sentenced Smalls as a youthful offender to a term of imprisonment \r\n  not to exceed six years.Â  Smalls appeals, arguing the trial court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to accept the guilty plea.Â  We agree and vacate the conviction.\r\nBackground\r\nSmallsâ€™ indictment for second-degree lynching alleges:\r\n\r\nThat Delbert Louis Smalls did in Charleston County on or about \r\n  the 2nd day of June, 1998 willfully and unlawfully and feloniously participate \r\n  as a member of a group consisting of three people in committing an act of violence \r\n  against the person of Richard Spearing by hitting him with their hands, feet, \r\n  and a metal chair, in violation of Section 16-3-220 of the South Carolina Code \r\n  of Laws (1976) as amended.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, Smallsâ€™ attorney informed the court that \r\n  although the charge against Smalls was â€œlisted as a lynchingâ€ Smalls was â€œ[p]leading \r\n  down to an ABHAN.â€Â  No separate indictment charging Smalls with ABHAN had been \r\n  prepared.Â  Counsel for Smalls explained, â€œYour honor, as I understand it, the \r\n  way that Mr. Smalls is pleading to the ABHAN is actually a waiver on the same \r\n  piece of paper, on the same sentencing sheet as the lynching second.â€Â  In questioning \r\n  Smalls about his intent to waive presentment to the grand jury, the trial court \r\n  explained to Smalls that â€œyou are indicted for lynching.Â  The question, of course, \r\n  is whether the ABHAN, which is what the offer is to plead to, has in fact been \r\n  indicted or is in fact a lesser included offense . . . .Â  Do you want to waive \r\n  that right and proceed today on the ABHAN charge or do you want me to send that \r\n  charge to the grand jury?â€Â  Smalls responded:Â  â€œI waive it.â€Â  The court then \r\n  proceeded to accept Smallsâ€™ plea.Â  \r\nAccording to the sentencing sheet, Smalls pled \r\n  guilty under indictment 1998-GS-10-8378, which included only the charge of second-degree \r\n  lynching.Â  The indictment was never amended to charge Smalls with ABHAN.Â  The \r\n  sentencing sheet expressly refers, however, to ABHAN as the crime to which Smalls \r\n  pled guilty and for which he was sentenced.Â  \r\nDiscussion\r\nOn appeal, Smalls asserts that because \r\n  no indictment charging him with ABHAN was ever prepared, his waiver of presentment \r\n  to the grand jury was insufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon \r\n  the trial court to accept his plea of guilty to that charge.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Constitution provides:\r\n\r\nNo person may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction \r\n  over which is not within the magistrateâ€™s court, unless on a presentment or \r\n  indictment of a grand jury of the county where the crime has been committed \r\n  . . . .Â  The General Assembly may provide for the waiver of an indictment by \r\n  the accused.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. I, Â§11.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section \r\n  17-19-10 states:\r\n\r\nNo person shall be held to answer in any court for an alleged \r\n  crime or offense, unless upon indictment by a grand jury, except in the following \r\n  cases:\r\n  \r\n(1)Â  When a prosecution by information is expressly \r\n  authorized by statute;\r\n(2)&nbsp; In proceedings before a police court or magistrate; \r\n  and\r\n(3)Â  In proceedings before courts martial.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003).\r\nAny person arrested upon a warrant for a felony or \r\n  a non-magistrate level misdemeanor may apply to the clerk of court for immediate \r\n  disposition of the case.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-120 (2003).Â  South Carolina \r\n  Code Annotated sections 17-23-130 and 17-23-140 govern the disposition of such \r\n  cases.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt by the solicitor of the warrant forwarded to \r\n  him pursuant to the provisions of Â§ 17-23-120, he may forthwith prepare a \r\n  formal indictment as now provided by law in such cases and shall return \r\n  it to the clerk of court.Â  The clerk of court shall then notify the sheriff \r\n  or one of his duly authorized deputies to bring the defendant before the clerk \r\n  at a time and place to be stated in the notice at which time the clerk shall \r\n  have the defendant sign a waiver of the presentment by the grand jury and his \r\n  plea of guilty; provided, that no plea shall be entered or made under \r\n  this section except by and with the consent of the solicitor of the circuit \r\n  after investigation by such solicitor. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-130 (2003) (third emphasis \r\n  in original).\r\n\r\n Upon the defendantâ€™s signing the waiver of presentment \r\n  and the plea of guilty the clerk of court shall deliver the indictment \r\n  to the sheriff or one of his duly authorized deputies whose duty it shall be \r\n  to appear before the resident judge of the circuit or presiding judge therein \r\n  at some convenient time and place, having with him the defendant.Â  And upon \r\n  the defendantâ€™s acknowledging his plea before the judge the judge shall sentence \r\n  the defendant as though the indictment had been presented by the grand jury \r\n  and the plea of the defendant taken at the regular term of the court of general \r\n  sessions of the county in which the case arose.Â  Provided, however, \r\n  that in the event the defendant is charged with a felony, the acknowledgement \r\n  by the defendant of his plea and the sentencing by the judge shall take place \r\n  only in open court and shall not take place in chambers. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-140 (2003) (fourth emphasis \r\n  in original).\r\nCompliance with sections 17-23-130 and -140 is \r\n  mandatory.Â  Odom v. State, 350 S.C. 300, 302, 566 S.E.2d 528, 529 (2002).\r\nOur case law describes the existence of a sufficient \r\n  true-billed indictment or a valid waiver of presentment as a prerequisite to \r\n  a valid guilty plea.Â  â€œExcept for certain minor offenses, the circuit court \r\n  does not have jurisdiction to hear a guilty plea unless there has been an indictment, \r\n  a waiver of presentment, or unless the charge is a lesser included offense of \r\n  the crime charged in the indictment.â€Â  Hopkins v. State, 317 S.C. 7, \r\n  9, 451 S.E.2d 389, 390 (1994).Â  See also Odom, 350 S.C. at 302, \r\n  566 S.E.2d at 529 (â€œIn the absence of an indictment, there must be a valid waiver \r\n  of presentment for the trial court to have subject matter jurisdiction of the \r\n  offense.â€).Â  Here, no indictment was prepared stating the offense of ABHAN.Â  \r\n  Nor was the indictment charging Smalls with second-degree lynching amended to \r\n  charge him with ABHAN.Â  Additionally, because â€œcircumstances of aggravationâ€ \r\n  is an element of ABHAN not included in second-degree lynching, ABHAN is not \r\n  a lesser-included offense of second-degree lynching.Â  Knox v.

ACLU of S.C., Inc., 323 \r\n  S.C. 384, 387-88, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1996) (â€œWhere the terms of the statute \r\n  are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€).Â  \r\n  Inasmuch as no indictment was prepared charging Smalls with ABHAN as required \r\n  by statute, no valid written waiver of presentment to the grand jury could have \r\n  been accomplished and, in turn, the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to accept the guilty plea.Â  See Summerall&nbsp;v. State, 278 S.C. \r\n  255, 256, 294 S.E.2d 344, 344 (1982) (â€œBy their plain language, Â§Â§ 17-23-130 \r\n  and 140 make a written waiver of presentment of indictments not presented to \r\n  a grand jury mandatory before the trial judge can accept the plea.â€).Â  Because \r\n  â€œparties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent,â€ Smallsâ€™ signature \r\n  on the sentencing sheet was insufficient absent an indictment charging him with \r\n  ABHAN.Â  State v.

California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), asserting \r\n    the appeal was without merit.Â  This court agreed as to the other charges and \r\n    dismissed the appeal as it pertained to them, but ordered the parties to brief \r\n    the issue discussed in this opinion.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3639","title":"Fender v.

Fender in this quiet title action.Â Â  We reverse and \r\n    remand. \r\n  FACTS\r\n\r\n \r\n  The parties each claim title to a parcel of unimproved land.Â  Each can trace \r\n    their titles through a series of intestate and deed conveyances to two â€œHead \r\n    of Family Land Certificatesâ€ granted by the United States District Tax Commission \r\n    to Roger Smashum around 1867.Â  Roger Smashumâ€™s interest eventually passed \r\n    through intestacy to his son John Smashum and eventually to two of his grandsons, \r\n    Arthur Smashum and Thomas Smashum.Â  \r\n  Fender claims title through a November 1988 deed derived from a succession of \r\n    conveyances from Arthur Smashum.Â  In 1966, Arthur Smashum conveyed his interest \r\n    in the property to Betty M. Sloan by quit-claim deed.Â  Sloan conveyed the \r\n    property back to Arthur in 1969 by quit-claim deed.Â  In 1983, Arthur conveyed \r\n    the property to himself and Charlie Mae Brantley as joint tenants with the \r\n    right of survivorship.Â  Arthur died in 1984 and in 1988 Charlie Mae conveyed \r\n    the property to W. Thomas Parker and Fender by warranty deed. \r\n    [1] Â  \r\n  Henrietta Jones, Sarah Shepard and Lucy Smith, claim a tenancy-in-common with \r\n    Fender as heirs of Thomas Smashum.Â  Queen Smashum claims a one-eighth tenancy \r\n    in common interest with Fender through a 1999 quit-claim deed from Adam Smashum, \r\n    an heir of Thomas Smashum.Â  \r\n  In December 1999, Fender initiated the present action seeking to quiet title \r\n    to the property.Â  He asserted the absence of estate or administrative proceedings \r\n    related to the estates of Roger Smashum, John Smashum, and Arthur Smashum \r\n    left a cloud over his title.Â  In his complaint, Fender alleges the interest \r\n    of a business associate and his was adverse to all others. His complaint states:\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  That possession of the property which is the subject \r\n    of this cause of action has been in actual, open, notorious and exclusive \r\n    possession of [Fender and a business associate] under claim of title and that \r\n    there has been such continued occupation and possession of the premises for \r\n    over ten (10) years.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  Queen Smashum answered on behalf of herself and the \r\n    heirs of Thomas Smashum in May 2000, and counterclaimed to quiet title to \r\n    the property in the name of the Heirs.Â  The Heirs claimed Queen Smashum, Henrietta \r\n    Jones, Sarah Shepard, and Lucy Smith each owned an undivided one-eighth interest \r\n    in the property.Â  \r\n  In June 2001, Fender made a motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n    The circuit court conducted a hearing on Fenderâ€™s motion the following month.Â  \r\n    In its order issued in August 2000, the court granted summary judgment to \r\n    Fender.Â  This appeal follows.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine \r\n    issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n    as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d \r\n    857, 860 (2002).Â  When determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, \r\n    the evidence and all inferences, which can reasonably be drawn from it, must \r\n    be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Faile \r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, \r\n    540 (2002).&nbsp; If triable issues exist, those issues must be submitted \r\n    to the jury.&nbsp; Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, \r\n    718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Even where no dispute as to evidentiary \r\n    facts exists, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from \r\n    them, summary judgment should not be granted.&nbsp; Hall v. Fedor, \r\n    349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; Moreover, \r\n    summary judgment is a drastic remedy that should be cautiously invoked to \r\n    ensure no person is improperly deprived of a trial of disputed factual issues.&nbsp; \r\n    Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., 349 S.C. 356, 363, \r\n    563 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2002).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  The Heirs argue the circuit court erred in finding Fender \r\n    acquired title to the subject property through adverse possession.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\n \r\n  As an initial matter, the Heirs assert the circuit court \r\n    erred in failing to find that they are co-tenants in the subject property \r\n    with Fender.Â  The Heirs cite 86 C.J.S. Tenancy In Common Â§ 8 (1997) \r\n    for the proposition that upon the intestate death of John Smashum and his \r\n    wife, his two surviving children, Arthur Smashum and Thomas Smashum owned \r\n    the property as tenants in common. They further argue that any grantees of \r\n    Arthur necessarily owned a proportional interest in the property as tenants \r\n    in common with them as heirs of Thomas Smashum. While acknowledging that Arthur \r\n    and Thomas were cotenants, Fender asserts the cotenancy came to an end when \r\n    Arthur conveyed the property to a stranger, reacquired title to the property, \r\n    and thereafter conveyed the property by warranty deed to himself and Charlie \r\n    Mae Brantley. [2] Â Â  \r\n    He further refers to the deposition testimony of Queen Smashum that prior \r\n    to the death of Arthur Smashum in 1985, she obtained permission from him for \r\n    her and her husband Adam to plant a garden on the property. \r\n  As stated in the case of Andrews v. McDade, 201 \r\n    S.C. 24, 28-29,Â  21 S.E. 2d 202, 204 (1942):\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  As to real property, the general rule is that where \r\n    the state has passed a perfect legal title, the doctrine of abandonment is \r\n    not applicable thereto, and that the title vested in the grantee cannot be \r\n    affected or transferred by his act in departing from the land and leaving \r\n    it unoccupied, or otherwise ceasing to exercise dominion over it . . . . \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  At common law, while an incorporeal hereditament may \r\n    be lost by abandonment, the principle is firmly established that perfect legal \r\n    title to a corporeal hereditament cannot be abandoned, or lost by abandonment, \r\n    operating alone, and dissociated from other acts or circumstances; and so \r\n    it is frequently said that so far as land is concerned, there can be an abandonment \r\n    only in a case where the title is imperfect, or less than absolute. The doctrine \r\n    of abandonment has, therefore, no application to a fee simple; but inchoate \r\n    rights and equitable rights in land may be abandoned, and so may mere possessory \r\n    rights, and rights acquired by user â€¦.\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n  Although technically a fee simple title holder may not \r\n    by nonuse abandon his title, his nonuse and failure to assert his title to \r\n    the property may constitute an important circumstance in a determination of \r\n    whether another has held the property adversely to the title holder. As clarified \r\n    at oral argument, Fender does not claim he ousted the Heirs, but rather claims \r\n    his predecessors in title ousted the Heirs. Thus, he reasons he is not a cotenant \r\n    with the Heirs and thus need only prove adverse possession for ten years prior \r\n    to the date of the commencement of this action. We first examine whether Fender=s \r\n    predecessors in title ousted the Heirs.\r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  â€œOusterâ€ is the actual turning out or keeping excluded \r\n    a party entitled to possession of any real property.Â Â  Grant v. Grant, \r\n    288 S.C. 86, 340 S.E.2d 791 (Ct. App. 1986). . . . Actual ouster of a tenant \r\n    in common by a cotenant in possession occurs when the possession is attended \r\n    with such circumstances as to evince a claim of exclusive right and title \r\n    and a denial of the right of the other tenants to participate in the profits.Â  \r\n    Woods v. Bivens, 292 S.C. 76, 354 S.E.2d 909 (1987);Â  Brevard v. \r\n    Fortune, 221 S.C. 117, 69 S.E.2d 355 (1952).Â  The acts relied upon to \r\n    establish an ouster must be of an unequivocal nature, and so distinctly hostile \r\n    to the rights of the other cotenants that the intention to disseize is clear \r\n    and unmistakable.Â Â  Felder, 278 S.C. at 330, 295 S.E.2d at 642.Â  Only \r\n    in rare, extreme cases will the ouster by one cotenant of other cotenants \r\n    be implied from exclusive possession and dealings with the property, such \r\n    as collection of rents and improvement of the property. Â Id., 278 S.C. \r\n    at 331, 295 S.E.2d at 642.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  Freeman v. Freeman, 323 S.C. 95, 99-100, 473 \r\n    S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1996). â€œOuster is presumed from possession only \r\n    if it is continued for a period of twenty years.Â  Title by ten yearsâ€™ adverse \r\n    possession by a cotenant against another may be acquired only after actual \r\n    ouster of which the latter has notice, or should have in the exercise of a \r\n    reasonable diligence and vigilance.â€ Watson v. Little, 224 S.C. 359, \r\n    364, 79 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1953).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  We conclude the conveyance from Arthur to Betty Sloan \r\n    by quit-claim deed in 1966; the reconveyance by Sloan to Arthur in 1969; the \r\n    conveyance to himself and Charlie Mae Brantley as joint tenants in 1983, and \r\n    the conveyance by Brantley \r\n    [3]  to Fender and W. Thomas Parker by a purported warranty deed \r\n    in 1988, together with the fact Queen Smashum obtained Arthurâ€™s permission \r\n    to plant a garden on the property are insufficient by themselves to establish \r\n    that the Heirs were ousted.Â  â€œIn the absence of authorization or ratification, \r\n    any attempted conveyance of the common property by one cotenant is not binding \r\n    upon his cotenants, and operates to pass title to nothing more than the sellerâ€™s \r\n    own interest.â€Â  20 Am. Jur. 2d Cotenancy and Joint Ownership Â§ 106 \r\n    (1995). We recognize that these conveyances are some evidence of ouster and \r\n    should not be ignored [4]  \r\n    for possession under such deeds and the assertion of exclusive and unequivocal \r\n    ownership in time could ripen into title by adverse possession.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n    Arthur did not enter into possession under such a deed.Â  Moreover, his transfer \r\n    to Betty Sloan in 1966 and her reconveyance to him in 1969 were by quit-claim \r\n    deeds which gives rise to the inference Arthur realized he may have had less \r\n    than a good legal title. [5] Â  In addition, we find that Fender \r\n    did not present evidence regarding the character of Arthur=s possession or \r\n    that Arthur took actions to exclude the Heirs from the property or asserted \r\n    exclusive ownership over the land.Â  Likewise, there is no evidenceÂ  ofÂ  the \r\n    character of Charlie Mae=s possession of the property.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  We conclude, therefore, that a question of fact exists \r\n    whether Fender established the Heirs were ousted of their interest in the \r\n    property by Arthur orÂ  Charlie Mae. We further conclude that under the posture \r\n    of the record in this case, Fender and the Heirs are co-tenants in the property.Â  \r\n    Therefore, Fender must show that his actions toward the property amounted \r\n    to an ouster of the Heirs before he can establish title by adverse possession.Â  \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  There are well-established principles applicable to \r\n    cotenancy, which control the controversy . . . .Â  A cotenant has the right, \r\n    in common with his cotenants, to the possession of the property owned in common, \r\n    so ordinarily the possession by one cotenant is the possession of all.Â  The \r\n    latter ceases when the exclusive possession of a cotenant becomes adverse \r\n    to the right of possession by the other cotenant or cotenants; but the hostile \r\n    character of the possession must be such as to amount to an ouster of the \r\n    other cotenant or cotenants and must be clearly and unmistakably established \r\n    by the evidence.Â  While the possessor need not give express notice of the \r\n    hostility of his possession to the other or others, the nature of it must \r\n    be brought home, as it has been said, to the other owner or owners.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n  Watson, 224 S.C. at 365, 79 S.E.2d at 387.Â  One \r\n    claiming title to land by adverse possession has the burden of proving adverse \r\n    possession by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Lusk v. Callaham, 287 \r\n    S.C. 459, 460, 339 S.E.2d 156, 157 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\n  The circuit court makes no reference to ouster in its \r\n    order, but analyzes Fenderâ€™s claim of title based solely on an adverse possession \r\n    analysis. In fact, as we understand Fenderâ€™s claim, he does not claim title \r\n    to the property pursuant to ouster of the heirs, but rather based solely on \r\n    adverse possession. Inasmuch as ouster is a prerequisite to a cotenant claiming \r\n    title by adverse possession, we will analyze Fenderâ€™s evidence to determine \r\n    whether a question of fact exists as to whether Fender met this prerequisite. \r\n  \r\n  The circuit court found the ten-year statutory period \r\n    began with the November 14, 1988 deed to Fender and Parker, and ended in November \r\n    1998.Â Â  In finding adverse possession, the court relied on: 1) the receipt \r\n    by Fender of a warranty deed dated November 14, 1988; 2) the paying of property \r\n    taxes for the statutory period of ten years; 3) the assertion of title by \r\n    the giving and receiving of fractional interests through successive conveyances \r\n    by warranty deeds during the statutory period; and 4) the erection of no trespassing \r\n    signs on the property during the statutory period.Â Â Â Â  The trial court also \r\n    presumed Adam and Queen Smashumâ€™s previous use of the property was merely \r\n    permissive, based on Queenâ€™s statement that Arthur gave her â€œthe privilegeâ€ \r\n    to plant a garden on the property before his 1984 death.Â Â Â  While Fenderâ€™s \r\n    affidavit states he and his co-owner â€œexercised ownership rights â€¦by tending \r\n    and maintaining the property,â€ the affidavit does not indicate how, nor does \r\n    the circuit court place any significance to this statement.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  We find the actions cited by the circuit court do not \r\n    as a matter of law establish ouster and consequently do not show Fender obtained \r\n    title to the property by adverse possession. Fender=s proof is not clear and \r\n    unequivocalÂ  that he exercised â€œhostile, open, actual, notorious and exclusiveâ€ \r\n    possession of the tract throughout the ten-year period.Â  The fact that Fender \r\n    placed â€œNo Trespassingâ€ signs on the property, without more, cannot be shown \r\n    to be adverse to the rights of the other co-tenants.Â  Especially in the light \r\n    of the deposition testimony of Queen Smashum that she visited the property \r\n    in recent years and did not see the â€œNo Trespassingâ€ signs allegedly posted \r\n    by Fender.Â  See Felder v. Fleming, 278 S.C. 327, 330, 295 S.E.2d \r\n    640, 642 (1982) and Horne v. Cox, 237 S.C. 41, 44-45, 115 S.E.2d 513, \r\n    515 (1960) (Possession of one tenant in common is the possession of all and, \r\n    for one tenant to establish title against a cotenant by adverse possession, \r\n    he must overcome the strong presumption that he holds possession in recognition \r\n    of the cotenancy.)Â Â Â  In addition, the fact that Fender paid the taxes does \r\n    not constitute ouster.Â  See Watson, 224 S.C. at 368, 79 S.E.2d \r\n    at 387 (payment of taxes by a cotenant ordinarily entitles him only to a proportionate \r\n    contribution from the other cotenants).Â  The circuit court erred in finding \r\n    that Fender established title by adverse possession to the subject property.Â  \r\n  \r\n  For the forgoing reasons, the circuit court=s summary \r\n    judgment order is reversed and the case remanded to the circuit court for \r\n    proceedings consistent with this decision.\r\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED.

Taggart, of the \r\n  SC Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  William Adams was convicted of third degree burglary \r\n  and grand larceny.Â  He was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of \r\n  five years for third degree burglary and five years, suspended upon the service \r\n  of four years plus five years probation, for grand larceny.Â  These sentences \r\n  were consecutive to the federal sentence Adams was serving at the time.Â  Adams \r\n  appeals, arguing that (1) the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD); and (2) the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to declare a mistrial after prejudicial testimony was admitted.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBrian Freeman and his father, both of Red Oak Builders, developed \r\n  some property for a subdivision called Abner Creek Station in Spartanburg County.Â  \r\n  Freeman lived adjacent to the subdivision.Â  On the evening of January 21, 1998, \r\n  Freeman returned to his home after work and noticed the garage door of the model \r\n  home in the subdivision was open.Â  He contacted the police, noted that two cabinets \r\n  were missing from the home, and filed a police report.Â  After securing the home, \r\n  Freeman returned to his house across the street.\r\nIn the early morning hours of January 22, 1998, Freeman awoke and \r\n  discovered that the garage door to the model home was open again.Â  Freeman called \r\n  the police.Â  He observed that furniture was missing from the home, including \r\n  two leather wingback chairs and a cherry wood dining table and chair set.\r\nThe police questioned Adams regarding the burglary.Â  Adams gave a \r\n  statement admitting his participation in the crime.Â  Adams declared he took \r\n  â€œsome leather chairs and some odds and ends furniture.â€Â  He showed the police \r\n  the house in Abner Creek that he burglarized.Â  Adams executed a permission to \r\n  search form.Â  Police officers recovered the cherry wood dining table and chairs.Â  \r\n  The leather chairs were never recovered.\r\nIn July 1998, Adams was indicted by the Spartanburg County grand jury for second \r\n  degree burglary and grand larceny in indictments 98-GS-42-3973 (3973) and 98-GS-42-3974 \r\n  (3974), respectively, in connection with the burglary of the furniture.Â  Adams \r\n  was not tried, however, because he was incarcerated in federal prison in North \r\n  Carolina sometime thereafter. \r\nOn October 14, 1999, Adams wrote to the solicitor for Spartanburg \r\n  County requesting a list of charges pending against him.Â  On October 27, 1999, \r\n  the solicitorâ€™s office wrote to Adams, informing him that two charges of second \r\n  degree burglary and two charges of petit larceny, indictments 98-GS-42-3952 \r\n  through 3955, were pending against him.Â  No mention was made of indictments \r\n  3973 or 3974.\r\nOn December 28, 1999, the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent the solicitor \r\n  a notice indicating that a detainer had been filed against Adams in the Stateâ€™s \r\n  favor and that Adams was tentatively scheduled for release on July 23, 2001.Â  \r\n  Adams was given a Notice of Untried Indictments from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, \r\n  dated February 23, 2000, which listed his Spartanburg untried indictments as \r\n  indictments 3952, 3953, 3954, 3955, and 3982.Â  It did not list indictments 3973 \r\n  or 3974.\r\nOn May 12, 2000, the solicitor sent the Inmate Systems Manager for \r\n  the Federal Bureau of Prisons a letter regarding outstanding indictments against \r\n  Adams.Â  The letter included â€œcertified copies of Indictment # 98-GS-42-3952 \r\n  through 3955 and # 98-GS-42-3967 through 3982 as detainersâ€ against Adams and \r\n  requested the prison to advise the State â€œas to his intentions concerning disposition \r\n  of these charges through IAD.â€Â  Adams was served with copies of the\r\ndetainers.\r\n On September 11, 2000, Adams sent the solicitor a letter with the \r\n  subject line â€œIAD-Notice of Untried Indictments.â€Â  Adams advised the solicitor \r\n  that he received the detainers filed against him, waived extradition, and expected \r\n  his case to be brought to trial within 180 days or else he would seek a dismissal \r\n  of the charges.Â  A Waiver of Extradition, dated September 6, 2000, and signed \r\n  by Adams was included with the letter.Â  The waiver stated that Adams was waiving \r\n  extradition on case numbers 98-GS-42-3952 through 3955 and 98-GS-42-3967 through \r\n  3982.Â  Adams included a motion for a fast and speedy trial on indictments numbered \r\n  98-GS-42-3952 through 3955 and 98-GS-42-3967 through 3982.\r\nOn October 12, 2000, the Inmate Systems Manager for the Federal Bureau of Prisons \r\n  sent the solicitor a letter informing him that Adams had requested disposition \r\n  of pending charges against him.Â  In the letter, the Inmate Systems Manager requested \r\n  that the State take action under the IAD in order to dispose of the pending \r\n  charges.Â  The letter indicated that the outstanding charges included indictments \r\n  3952, 3953, 3954, 3955, and 3982.Â  A certificate of inmate status was sent on \r\n  the same date.Â  The certificate listed the same indictments.Â  Neither the certificate \r\n  of inmate status nor the letter listed indictments 3973 or 3974.\r\nAdams was extradited to Spartanburg County.Â  He was tried on indictments \r\n  3973 and 3974 in April 2001.Â  Adams complained prior to the start of trial and \r\n  during the trial that the State should not be allowed to try Adams on indictments \r\n  3973 and 3974 because they were not listed in the initial notification of outstanding \r\n  indictments sent to Adams and because the State did not correct the Federal \r\n  Bureau of Prisons when it sent the October 12, 2000, certificate of inmate status \r\n  which failed to list 3973 and 3974.Â  The trial court denied the motion and allowed \r\n  the State to proceed on the indictments.Â  The State later admitted that it did \r\n  not have a copy of the detainer.\r\nAfter the State presented its case, Adams moved for a directed verdict arguing, \r\n  in part, that the State was not entitled to proceed on indictments 3973 and \r\n  3974 under the IAD.Â  The court denied the motion.Â  The jury acquitted Adams \r\n  of the second degree burglary charge, but found Adams guilty of the lesser included \r\n  offense of third degree burglary.Â  Additionally, Adams was convicted of grand \r\n  larceny.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the trial court have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to try Adams under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act?\r\nII.Â  Did the trial court err in failing to declare a mistrial \r\n  after testimony regarding a prior bad act was admitted?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  INTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS ACT\r\n(IAD)\r\nAdams contends the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over the burglary and grand larceny charges because the State failed to follow \r\n  the requirements of the IAD.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Requirements of the IAD\r\nWe initially address the requirements of the IAD.Â  The purpose of \r\n  the IAD is to allow participating states to uniformly and expeditiously treat \r\n  requests by prisoners for disposition of outstanding charges.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-11-10, Art. I (2003); State v. Patterson, 273 S.C. 361, 256 S.E.2d \r\n  417 (1979); see also State v. Finley, 277 S.C. 548, 551, 290 S.E.2d \r\n  808, 809 (1982) (â€œThe purpose of I.A.D. is to foster the expeditious disposition \r\n  of charges outstanding against prisoners so as to eliminate uncertainties which \r\n  accompany the filing of detainers.â€).Â  Article III of the IAD provides in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\n\r\n(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or \r\n  correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance \r\n  of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried \r\n  indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been \r\n  lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred \r\n  eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting \r\n  officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officerâ€™s jurisdiction \r\n  written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final \r\n  disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint;Â  provided, \r\n  that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, \r\n  the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable \r\n  continuance.Â  The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate \r\n  of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term \r\n  of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, \r\n  the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, \r\n  the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state \r\n  parole agency relating to the prisoner.\r\n(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph \r\n  (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner \r\n  of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward \r\n  it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and \r\n  court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to \r\n  paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all \r\n  untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers \r\n  have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting \r\n  official the request for final disposition is specifically directed.Â  The warden, \r\n  commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner \r\n  shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the \r\n  several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisonerâ€™s request for final \r\n  disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner.Â  \r\n  Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies \r\n  of the prisonerâ€™s written notice, request, and the certificate.Â  If trial is \r\n  not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior \r\n  to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, \r\n  information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the \r\n  court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 17-11-10, Art. III (2003) (emphasis added).\r\nThe IAD clearly requires that an inmate send written notice to the \r\n  appropriate prosecuting officer of his desire for a final disposition of outstanding \r\n  indictments against him in that jurisdiction.Â  This notice must include a certificate \r\n  of the inmateâ€™s status at the correctional facility, including his sentence, \r\n  good time credit, and projected parole date.Â  Although the Federal Bureau of \r\n  Prisons sent the State a certificate of inmate status on October 12, 2000, it \r\n  is not clear whether this was accompanied by a copy of Adamsâ€™ notice for disposition \r\n  under the IAD.Â  Further, the September 11, 2000 memorandum, which purports to \r\n  be a notice under the IAD, includes a handwritten note dated September 27, 2000, \r\n  that Adams did not file the IAD.Â  Because it is unclear whether Adams followed \r\n  the requirements of Â§ 17-11-10, Art. III(a) regarding notice, Adams may not \r\n  come within the penumbra of the IAD at all.\r\nIn any event, it appears that Adams had notice that the State intended \r\n  to try him on indictments 3973 and 3974.Â  Despite the fact that the October \r\n  27, 1999, letter from the solicitor informing Adams of outstanding charges did \r\n  not list 3973 or 3974, the solicitor filed copies of outstanding indictments \r\n  3967 through 3982 with the federal prison as detainers in May 2000.Â  Further, \r\n  Adams moved for a speedy trial and signed a waiver of extradition on indictments \r\n  3967 through 3982.Â  This range of indictments included numbers 3973 and 3974.Â  \r\n  Because the State eventually lodged a range of detainers against Adams that \r\n  included 3973 and 3974, and Adams requested a speedy trial and waived extradition \r\n  on the same range of indictments, Adamsâ€™ request for disposition operated as \r\n  a request for final disposition of all untried indictments against him, including \r\n  3973 and 3974.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-11-10 Art. III(d) (2003).Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  the trial court did not err in finding the requirements of the IAD were followed.\r\nB.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n1.Â  Federal Analysis\r\nCourts have recognized that a violation of the IAD is not recognizable \r\n  as a claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  In Frisbie v. Collins, \r\n  342 U.S. 519 (1952), the United States Supreme Court referenced the rule announced \r\n  in Ker v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436 (1886), that â€œthe power of a court to \r\n  try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought \r\n  within the courtâ€™s jurisdiction by reason of a â€˜forcible abduction.â€™â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 522.Â  The Frisbie Court explained:\r\n\r\n[D]ue process of law is satisfied when one present in court \r\n  is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprized of the charges against \r\n  him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards.Â  \r\n  There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty \r\n  person rightfully convicted to escape justice because he was brought to trial \r\n  against his will.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n2.Â  State Law Explication\r\nTurning to subject matter jurisdiction under South Carolina law, \r\n  we find no merit to Adamsâ€™ claims.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine \r\n  cases of a general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  City \r\n  of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d 492 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A \r\n  circuit court acquires subject matter jurisdiction over a criminal matter where \r\n  there is an indictment which sufficiently states the offense, the defendant \r\n  waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime \r\n  charged in the indictment.Â  State v. Wilkes, Op. No. 25607 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. filed March 17, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 24); State v. Primus, \r\n  349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002); State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 639, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2001).\r\nLack of subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental and may not be waived.Â  \r\n  Hooks v. State, Op. No. 25590 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 3, 2003) \r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at 60).Â  Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  may be raised at any time.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773 (1998); State v. Brown, 351 S.C. 522, 570 S.E.2d 559 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  see also State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (holding issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at \r\n  any time).\r\nAn indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with \r\n  sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment \r\n  to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and \r\n  whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.Â  Browning v. State, \r\n  320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995); State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, \r\n  572 S.E.2d 309 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Granger v. State, 333 \r\n  S.C. 2, 507 S.E.2d 322 (1998) (indictment is sufficient if it apprises defendant \r\n  of elements of offense intended to be charged and apprises defendant what he \r\n  must be prepared to meet).Â  The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment \r\n  is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains \r\n  the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently \r\n  apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.Â  Browning, \r\n  320 S.C. at 368, 465 S.E.2d at 359; State v. Reddick, 348 S.C. 631, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn South Carolina, an indictment â€œshall be deemed and judged sufficient and \r\n  good in law which, in addition to allegations as to time and place, as required \r\n  by law, charges the crime substantially in the language of the common law or \r\n  of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense \r\n  charged may be easily understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, \r\n  that the offense be alleged to be contrary to the statute in such case made \r\n  and provided.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).Â  An indictment passes legal \r\n  muster if it charges the crime substantially in the language of the statute \r\n  prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may \r\n  be easily understood.Â  Reddick, 348 S.C. at 635, 560 S.E.2d at 443.\r\nAdams asserts that he only waived extradition on the indictments initially \r\n  listed in the solicitorâ€™s first letter.Â  Whether Adams was properly transferred \r\n  to South Carolina for trial on indictments 3973 and 3974, when he argues he \r\n  only waived extradition on other indictments, is a question of personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Generally, jurisdiction of the person is acquired when the party charged is \r\n  arrested or voluntarily appears in court and submits himself to its jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  State v. Douglas, 245 S.C. 83, 138 S.E.2d 845 (1964); State v. Langford, \r\n  223 S.C. 20, 73 S.E.2d 854 (1953).Â  A defendant may waive any complaints he \r\n  may have regarding personal jurisdiction by failing to object to the lack of \r\n  personal jurisdiction and by appearing to defend his case.Â  See State \r\n  v. Bethea, 88 S.C. 515, 70 S.E. 11 (1911); see also State v. Castleman, \r\n  219 S.C. 136, 138-39, 64 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1951) (â€œA defendant may, of course, \r\n  waive his objection to the jurisdiction of the Court over his person . . . .â€); \r\n  Town of Ridgeland v. Gens, 83 S.C. 562, 65 S.E. 828 (1909) (the court \r\n  found no personal jurisdiction problem where the defendant appeared for his \r\n  trial, was represented by an attorney, and defended his case on the merits).Â  \r\n  Questions of personal jurisdiction will not deprive a trial court of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.\r\nFurther, Adams does not claim that indictments 3973 and 3974 failed to adequately \r\n  state the elements of the offenses for which he was charged.Â  He does not allege \r\n  that the indictments failed to adequately apprise him of what he must be prepared \r\n  to meet.Â  Nothing in the IAD purports to deprive a trial court of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction where the notice requirements are not followed.Â  Moreover, the \r\n  indictments apprised Adams of the elements of the offenses intended to be charged \r\n  and informed him of what circumstances he must be prepared to defend.Â  See \r\n  Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 533 S.E.2d 324 (2000) (indictment is sufficient \r\n  to convey jurisdiction if it apprises defendant of elements of offense intended \r\n  to be charged and informs defendant of circumstances he must be prepared to \r\n  defend).Â  The indictments stated the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the trial court to know what judgment to pronounce and Adams to know \r\n  what he was being called upon to answer.Â  See State v. Lynch, \r\n  344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001) (indictment is sufficient to confer jurisdiction \r\n  if offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable court \r\n  to know what judgment to pronounce, and defendant to know what he is called \r\n  upon to answer). Because the indictments adequately alleged the elements of \r\n  the charges against Adams, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nII.Â  MISTRIAL\r\nAdams maintains the trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding \r\n  the previous theft of the cabinets because it amounted to the prejudicial admission \r\n  of a prior bad act.Â  He claims the court should have declared a mistrial.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nAdams objected when Freeman testified regarding the two cabinets \r\n  missing from the model home when he first noticed something suspicious at the \r\n  model home in Abner Creek.Â  Adams requested a mistrial, arguing that he was \r\n  not being tried in connection with the missing cabinets, the testimony was not \r\n  relevant, and the jury was prejudiced â€œfrom hearing that the same crime occurred \r\n  within a couple of hours before.â€Â  The State alleged the information regarding \r\n  the cabinets taken in the first burglary, during the day, was relevant to show \r\n  that the more expensive furniture was not taken until the second burglary, during \r\n  that evening and the early morning hours.Â  The trial judge ruled the State could \r\n  introduce the testimony and asked Adams whether he would like a jury instruction \r\n  to the effect that he was not being tried in connection with the taking of the \r\n  cabinets.Â  Adams refused the jury instruction and renewed his motion for a mistrial.Â  \r\n  The court found the evidence admissible and denied the motion for a mistrial.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge.Â  State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999); \r\n  State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The \r\n  courtâ€™s decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion \r\n  amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d \r\n  626 (2000); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); see \r\n  also State v. Arnold, 266 S.C. 153, 157, 221 S.E.2d 867, 868 (1976) \r\n  (the general rule of this State is that â€œthe ordering of, or refusal of a motion \r\n  for mistrial is within the discretion of the trial judge and such discretion \r\n  will not be overturned in the absence of abuse thereof amounting to an error \r\n  of law.â€).\r\nâ€œThe power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with \r\n  the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious \r\n  causesâ€ stated into the record by the trial judge.Â  State v. Kirby, 269 \r\n  S.C. 25, 28, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977); see also State v. Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999) (mistrial should only be granted \r\n  in cases of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain \r\n  and obvious reasons).Â  The granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme \r\n  measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial \r\n  effect can be removed in no other way.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, \r\n  513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).\r\nA mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant \r\n  must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  \r\n  Harris, 340 S.C. at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 628; see also State v. \r\n  Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (mistrial should not be granted \r\n  unless absolutely necessary; to receive mistrial, defendant must show error \r\n  and resulting prejudice).Â  â€œThe less than lucid test is therefore declared to \r\n  be whether the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the ends of public \r\n  justice.â€Â  State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1983).Â  \r\n  â€œWhether a mistrial is manifestly necessary is a fact specific inquiry.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 457, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nA mistrial should not be ordered in every case where incompetent evidence is \r\n  received.Â  State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d 795 (1999).Â  â€œAn \r\n  instruction to disregard objectionable evidence is usually deemed to cure the \r\n  error in its admission unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable \r\n  that notwithstanding such instruction the accused was prejudiced.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 89-90, 512 S.E.2d at 801.\r\nA.Â  Relevance\r\nAdams argues that a mistrial was necessary because evidence regarding \r\n  the prior theft of the cabinets was not relevant to the charges for which he \r\n  was on trial.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the \r\n  trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); State \r\n  v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling on the \r\n  admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of \r\n  discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the \r\n  defendant.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001); State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error \r\n  of law. State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State \r\n  v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nAll relevant evidence is admissible.Â  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, \r\n  538 S.E.2d 248 (2000); Rule 402, SCRE.Â  Under Rule 401, SCRE, evidence is relevant \r\n  if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less \r\n  probable the matter in controversy.Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Rule 401, SCRE (â€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ \r\n  means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is \r\n  of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable \r\n  than it would be without the evidence.â€); In the Matter of the Care and Treatment \r\n  of Corley, Op. No. 25596 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 24, 2003) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 13) (evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make \r\n  more or less probable the matter in controversy).Â  \r\nâ€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially \r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE; see also \r\n  State v. Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 536 S.E.2d 666 (2000) (although evidence \r\n  is relevant, it should be excluded where danger of unfair prejudice substantially \r\n  outweighs its probative value).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative \r\n  probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in \r\n  exceptional circumstances.Â  Hamilton, 344 S.C. at 357, 543 S.E.2d at \r\n  593.Â  We review a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the \r\n  abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s judgment.Â  Id. at 358, 543 S.E.2d at 593.\r\nThe evidence regarding the theft of the cabinets from the first burglary \r\n  was relevant to the overall timing of events in this case.Â  Freeman noticed \r\n  the first burglary occurred after he returned home from work and he knew that \r\n  only cabinets were missing at that time.Â  Because testimony regarding the first \r\n  burglary was admitted, testimony regarding what was taken in the first burglary \r\n  was relevant to the issue of whether the furniture was taken in the later burglary.Â  \r\n  No evidence was presented at trial that Adams was a suspect in the burglary \r\n  of the cabinets.Â  As the evidence was relevant to the timing of the events in \r\n  this case, we find no error in its admission.Â  See Aleksey, 343 \r\n  S.C. at 35, 538 S.E.2d at 256 (trial judge is given broad discretion in ruling \r\n  on questions concerning relevancy of evidence, and his decision will be reversed \r\n  only if there is a clear abuse of discretion).\r\nFurthermore, Adams refused an instruction to the jury not to consider the first \r\n  burglary against Adams.Â  The evidence admitted in this case was relevant and \r\n  its admission did not require the extreme remedy of a mistrial.\r\nB.Â  Res Gestae/Lyle\r\nAdams contends the trial court erred in allowing \r\n  the admission of evidence regarding the theft of the cabinets because it amounted \r\n  to the prejudicial admission of a prior bad act.\r\nOur Supreme Court discussed the res gestae \r\n  theory in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996):\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence \r\n  of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of \r\n  the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately \r\n  connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and \r\n  is so much a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its \r\n  proof is appropriate in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by \r\n  proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense \r\n  is â€˜so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged \r\n  that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] \r\n  part of the res gestae of the crime charged.â€Â  And where evidence is admissible \r\n  to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, â€œ[t]here is no reason to \r\n  fragmentize the event under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting United States v. Masters, \r\n  622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir.1980)).Â  Under the res gestae theory, \r\n  evidence of other bad acts may be an integral part of the crime with which the \r\n  defendant is charged or may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding \r\n  the context in which the crime occurred.Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 745 (2001); State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999).\r\n We rule the testimony regarding the cabinets was admissible under \r\n  the res gestae theory.Â  The timing of the burglaries, and what \r\n  was taken from the model home in each one, were integral parts of the context \r\n  in which the crime was committed.Â  Thus, admission of the testimony regarding \r\n  the cabinets was necessary and relevant to a full presentation of the evidence.Â  \r\n  The trial court did not err in allowing the admission of the evidence under \r\n  the res gestae theory.Â  Additionally, the court properly denied \r\n  Adamsâ€™ motion for a mistrial.\r\nFurther, although Adams now argues on appeal that the admission of \r\n  evidence regarding the theft of the cabinets amounted to the improper admission \r\n  of a prior bad act in violation of Lyle, [1]  he did not raise this argument before the trial \r\n  court.Â  Arguments not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved \r\n  for appellate review.Â  See State v. Perez, 334 S.C. 563, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  754 (1999) (issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court will not \r\n  be considered on appeal).Â  Moreover, a defendant may not argue one ground below \r\n  and another on appeal.Â  See State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 \r\n  S.E.2d 228 (2000) (issue not preserved if defendant argues one ground for objection \r\n  at trial and a different ground on appeal).Â  As Adamsâ€™ Lyle argument \r\n  is not properly before this Court, we decline to address it.\r\nC.Â  Harmless Error\r\nFinally, we find that even assuming the trial court erred in allowing \r\n  testimony regarding the prior theft of the cabinets, the error was harmless.\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the \r\n  result of the trial.Â  State v. Charping, 313 S.C. 147, 437 S.E.2d 88 \r\n  (1993); State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial \r\n  errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 \r\n  S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Livingston, 282 S.C. 1, 317 S.E.2d 129 (1984).Â  \r\n  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless \r\n  where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no \r\n  other rational conclusion can be reached.â€Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. \r\n  1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989); see also State v. Kelley, 319 \r\n  S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (when guilt is conclusively proven by competent \r\n  evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court \r\n  will not set aside conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result).\r\nAdams confessed to the police regarding the break-in and theft of \r\n  the furniture from the home.Â  He led police to the site of the burglary and \r\n  helped in the recovery of some of the items.Â  Assuming the admission of Freemanâ€™s \r\n  testimony regarding the theft of the cabinets from the first burglary was error, \r\n  it did not affect the evidence that supported Adamsâ€™ guilt in the second burglary.Â  \r\n  We conclude the evidence supporting Adamsâ€™ conviction rendered any error harmless.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAdams waived extradition under the IAD for a range of indictments, \r\n  including 3973 and 3974.Â  These indictments informed Adams of the charges against \r\n  him and apprised him of what he had to defend against.Â  The indictments were \r\n  sufficient to convey subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court.Â  Because \r\n  the evidence regarding the theft of the cabinets was relevant and was admissible \r\n  under the res gestae theory, the trial court did not err in denying \r\n  Adamsâ€™ motion for mistrial.Â  Accordingly, Adamsâ€™ convictions and sentences are \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n CONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923) (evidence of accusedâ€™s \r\n    other crimes or wrongs is generally not admissible to prove his propensity \r\n    to commit the crime charged, but may be admissible to show motive, identity, \r\n    common scheme or plan, absence of mistake or accident, or intent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3641","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor \r\n  Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n CONNOR, J.:Â  Dana Dudley appeals \r\n  her convictions for trafficking in cocaine and conspiracy to traffic cocaine.Â  \r\n  Dudley, a Georgia resident, raises two issues on appeal:Â  (1) whether South \r\n  Carolina had jurisdiction to prosecute her because any alleged criminal conduct \r\n  took place outside the state; and (2) whether the trial judge erred in failing \r\n  to direct a verdict of not guilty on the charge of conspiracy to traffic cocaine \r\n  because there was no evidence she agreed to violate South Carolina law.Â  We \r\n  vacate her convictions.\r\nOriginally, a three-judge panel of this \r\n  Court heard this case.Â  In a divided opinion, the panel affirmed Dudleyâ€™s conviction \r\n  and sentence for trafficking in cocaine, and reversed her conviction for conspiracy \r\n  to traffic cocaine.Â  State v. Dudley, Op. No. 3579 (S.C. Ct. App. filed \r\n  Dec. 9, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 41 at 57).Â  Pursuant to section 14-8-90(a)(2) \r\n  of the South Carolina Code of Laws, the full Court voted to rehear the case \r\n  en banc.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-90(a)(2) (Supp. 2002) (â€œThe Court \r\n  may sit en banc to hear cases upon . . . its own motion agreed \r\n  to by six judges of the Court.â€).Â  Section 14-8-90(b) requires six votes for \r\n  a reversal of the judgment below.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-90(b) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  On rehearing, six judges voted to vacate both of Dudleyâ€™s convictions.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the original panel opinion is hereby withdrawn, and the opinions of this Court \r\n  are substituted.\r\nFACTS\r\nEarl Hale and Donald Stokes, admitted drug dealers, \r\n  both resided in Roanoke, Virginia.Â  Because Stokes and Hale were having some \r\n  â€œdry spellsâ€ in Roanoke, they decided to go to Atlanta to make a â€œdope run.â€Â  \r\n  Dana Dudley, a resident of Atlanta, Georgia, was a long-time friend of Stokes.Â  \r\n  On numerous occasions, Stokes spoke with Dudley by telephone.Â  Some time in \r\n  the early part of September of 1997, Stokes called Dudley from Roanoke and told \r\n  her that he was planning a trip to Atlanta and he would contact her when he \r\n  arrived.Â  On September 9, 1997, Stokes and Hale drove from Roanoke to Atlanta.Â  \r\n  Upon arriving, Stokes and Hale went to a nightclub and then returned to their \r\n  hotel.Â  The next morning, September 10th, Stokes called Dudley and asked her \r\n  to come to his hotel room.Â  Stokes asked Dudley if she could get them cocaine.Â  \r\n  Dudley took money from Stokes and Hale and left to purchase the cocaine.Â  Within \r\n  thirty to forty-five minutes, Dudley returned with the cocaine.Â  \r\n After purchasing the cocaine, Hale and Stokes \r\n  proceeded to drive home to Roanoke via Interstate 85 north toward Virginia.Â  \r\n  Hale and Stokes intended to sell the cocaine in Virginia.Â  As they were driving \r\n  through Anderson County, Deputy Matthew Durham, employed with the Anderson County \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department, signaled for them to stop after noticing Hale was weaving \r\n  and making an improper lane change.Â  Deputy Durham gave Hale a warning and asked \r\n  whether he could search the vehicle.Â  After Hale consented, Deputy Durham searched \r\n  the vehicle and found the cocaine.Â  At that point, Stokes attempted to flee \r\n  while Hale was being arrested by Deputy James Littleton, Deputy Durhamâ€™s partner.Â  \r\n  While Deputy Durham chased Stokes, Hale broke free in an attempt to retrieve \r\n  the cocaine and dispose of it.Â  Ultimately, the deputies apprehended Stokes \r\n  and Hale. Â Â Â \r\nAfter their arrest, Stokes and Hale identified \r\n  Dudley as the person from whom they had purchased the cocaine.Â  As part of a \r\n  deal, Stokes and Hale agreed to assist the Drug Enforcement Agency in prosecuting \r\n  narcotics cases in South Carolina and Virginia.Â  Through a series of recorded \r\n  telephone conversations, Stokes set up a controlled buy with Dudley.Â  Dudley \r\n  refused to meet Stokes in South Carolina, but agreed to meet him in Atlanta.Â  \r\n  Although Stokes met with Dudley just outside of Atlanta on September 15th, the \r\n  purchase was not successful.Â  Dudley, however, was arrested at this time for \r\n  the prior transaction when Stokes and Hale were stopped in Anderson on September \r\n  10th. \r\nAn Anderson County grand jury indicted Dudley \r\n  for trafficking in cocaine in an amount greater than 200 grams and less than \r\n  400 grams, and conspiracy to traffic cocaine. \r\n  [1] Â  A jury convicted Dudley of both charges.Â  The trial judge sentenced \r\n  her to twenty-five years imprisonment and payment of a $6,000 fine on both charges.Â  \r\n  The sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  Dudley appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nIn her appeal, Dudley raises two distinct issues. \r\n  Â First, Dudley argues South Carolina lacked jurisdiction to prosecute her for \r\n  trafficking in cocaine given she is a Georgia resident who never entered Anderson \r\n  County and never intended to commit any criminal act in South Carolina.Â  Secondly, \r\n  Dudley contends the trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of not \r\n  guilty as to the charge of conspiracy because there was no evidence she agreed \r\n  to violate South Carolina law. \r\nIn its analysis of these issues, the original panel thoroughly \r\n  discussed several jurisdictional concepts.Â  Specifically, all members of the \r\n  panel found:Â  (1) the circuit court was vested with subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  by means of a valid indictment; and (2) Dudley consented to the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  exercise of personal jurisdiction because she appeared at trial, defended her \r\n  case, and failed to raise any objection.Â  Because Dudley was a Georgia resident \r\n  and never entered the State of South Carolina in conjunction with the two offenses \r\n  for which she was charged, the panel concluded its jurisdictional analysis with \r\n  a discussion of this Stateâ€™s exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction over \r\n  acts committed by Dudley outside the state.Â  \r\nAlthough neither Dudley nor the State specifically raised \r\n  or argued extraterritorial jurisdiction, [2]  the original panel implicitly \r\n  recognized that extraterritorial jurisdiction is a theory under the general \r\n  concept of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See Weinhauer v. State, \r\n  334 S.C. 327, 513 S.E.2d 840 (1999) (stating issues involving subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction may be raised at anytime, including for the first time on appeal); \r\n  State v. Brown, 351 S.C. 522, 570 S.E.2d 559 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating \r\n  issues related to subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at anytime, can \r\n  be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte \r\n  by the Court).\r\nDuring the rehearing en banc, the \r\n  question arose concerning whether extraterritorial jurisdiction is actually \r\n  a component of subject matter jurisdiction or whether it is more properly considered \r\n  part of personal jurisdiction.Â  This question is significant in several respects.Â  \r\n  If extraterritorial jurisdiction is a component of subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  this Court is required to address it in this case despite Dudleyâ€™s failure to \r\n  specifically argue it at trial or on appeal.Â  If, on the other hand, extraterritorial \r\n  jurisdiction is classified as part of personal jurisdiction, then this Court \r\n  would be precluded from addressing this issue, given Dudley waived any challenge \r\n  to personal jurisdiction.Â  See Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, \r\n  ___, 576 S.E.2d 156, 165 (2003) (â€œObjections to personal jurisdiction, unlike \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction, are waived unless raised.â€); State v. Douglas, \r\n  245 S.C. 83, 138 S.E.2d 845 (1964) (holding a defendant may waive any objection \r\n  to personal jurisdiction by failing to object and going to trial on the merits).\r\nTo answer this question, we must analyze the general concept \r\n  of jurisdiction and distinguish between the component parts of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\nA.\r\nâ€œ[J]urisdiction of the offense charged and of the \r\n  person of the accused is indispensable to a valid conviction.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Langford, 223 S.C. 20, 26, 73 S.E.2d 854, 857 (1953).Â  Our Supreme Court \r\n  has distinguished the types of jurisdiction as follows:\r\n\r\nJurisdiction is of two distinct kinds:Â  (1) Jurisdiction \r\n  of the subject or subject matter, and (2) jurisdiction of the person.Â  In determining \r\n  questions relating to each, different rules apply.Â  Jurisdiction of the subject \r\n  matter cannot be waived by any act or admission of the parties; but a party \r\n  may confer jurisdiction over his person by consent, or may waive the right to \r\n  raise the question.\r\n\r\nDouglas, 245 S.C. at 87, 138 S.E.2d at 847.Â  The Court \r\n  has explained the theoretical underpinnings of subject matter jurisdiction as \r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n[T]he question of [subject matter] jurisdiction cannot be \r\n  waived by any act or admission of the parties, for the very obvious reason that \r\n  the parties have no power to invest any tribunal with jurisdiction of a subject \r\n  over which the law has not conferred jurisdiction upon such tribunal.Â  Hence \r\n  the common expression, â€˜Consent cannot confer jurisdiction.â€™ \r\n\r\nLangford, 223 S.C. at 27, 73 S.E.2d at 857 (quoting \r\n  City of Florence v. Berry, 61 S.C. 237, 240, 39 S.E. 389, 390 (1901)).Â  \r\n  â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases \r\n  of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€ Pierce \r\n  v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000).Â  \r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction over a criminal \r\n  offense if:Â  (1) there has been an indictment that sufficiently states the offense;Â  \r\n  (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  Carter v. State, 329 \r\n  S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998).Â  An indictment is sufficient if the offense \r\n  is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to \r\n  know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called \r\n  upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.Â  \r\n  State v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  17-19-20 (2003) (â€œEvery indictment shall be deemed and judged sufficient and \r\n  good in law which, in addition to allegations as to time and place, as required \r\n  by law, charges the crime substantially in the language of the common law or \r\n  of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense \r\n  charged may be easily understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, \r\n  that the offense be alleged to be contrary to the statute in such case made \r\n  and provided.â€).\r\nThe rule for personal jurisdiction, however, is very different.Â  \r\n  Our Supreme Court has stated:\r\n\r\nThe party may, by consent, confer jurisdiction over his \r\n  person, or may waive the right to raise the question, whether the proper \r\n  steps prescribed by law for obtaining such jurisdiction have been taken, as \r\n  is illustrated by the familiar instance of a party who, though not served with \r\n  a summons, appears and answers, and is thereby precluded from afterwards raising \r\n  the question as to whether the court had acquired jurisdiction of his person.\r\n\r\nLangford, 223 S.C. at 27, 73 S.E.2d at 857 (quoting \r\n  City of Florence v. Berry, 61 S.C. 237, 240, 39 S.E. 389, 390 (1901)).Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œGenerally, jurisdiction of the subject matter \r\n  is satisfied when appropriate charges are filed in a competent court, while \r\n  jurisdiction of the person is acquired when the party charged is arrested or \r\n  voluntarily appears in court and submits himself to its jurisdiction.â€Â  Douglas, \r\n  245 S.C. at 87, 138 S.E.2d at 847. \r\nApplying these concepts to the instant case, South \r\n  Carolina was vested with personal jurisdiction because Dudley appeared at trial \r\n  and defended her case on the merits.Â  With respect to subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  Dudley never challenged the validity of her indictments.Â  The indictments are \r\n  valid in that they sufficiently state the elements of the charged offenses.Â  \r\n  Thus, South Carolina was vested with subject matter jurisdiction to the extent \r\n  provided by a valid indictment.\r\nEven though these jurisdictional requirements are \r\n  satisfied, the facts of this case require an additional level of jurisdictional \r\n  analysis.Â  Without question South Carolina has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes \r\n  that occur within its borders.Â  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11 (â€œNo person \r\n  may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over which is not within \r\n  the magistrateâ€™s court, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury \r\n  of the county where the crime has been committed . . . .â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  1-1-10 (Supp. 2002) (â€œThe sovereignty and jurisdiction of this State extends \r\n  to all places within its bounds . . . .â€).Â  Dudleyâ€™s alleged criminal conduct, \r\n  however, occurred entirely in Georgia.Â  Therefore, we must determine whether \r\n  South Carolina was vested with jurisdiction over these offenses.Â  \r\nB.\r\nâ€œ[J]urisdictional limits are tied to the territorial reach \r\n  of the particular governmentâ€™s power.â€Â  4 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal \r\n  Procedure Â§ 16.1(a), at 458 (2d ed. 1999).Â  More specifically, â€œ[s]ubject \r\n  matter jurisdiction is limited by the territorial reach of the courts.â€Â  Rios \r\n  v. State, 733 P.2d 242, 245 (Wyo. 1987).Â  Common law has established â€œa \r\n  territorial principle as the jurisdictional foundation for the reach of state \r\n  laws.Â  Under that principle, states have power to make conduct a crime only \r\n  if that conduct takes place, or its results occur, within the stateâ€™s territorial \r\n  borders.â€Â  4 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure Â§ 16.1(a), at \r\n  459 (2d ed. 1999).Â  â€œConversely, there can be no territorial jurisdiction where \r\n  conduct and its results both occur outside the stateâ€™s territory.â€Â  4 id. \r\n  Â§ 16.4(c), at 572; see State v. Smith, 421 N.W.2d 315, 318 (Minn. \r\n  1988) (â€œ[C]riminal jurisdiction has been premised on the concept of territorialism.Â  \r\n  Jurisdiction depends on where the crime was committed.â€).Â  \r\nThe Supreme Court of North Carolina explained this theory \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nUnder this theory, a stateâ€™s jurisdiction over criminal matters \r\n  cannot extend beyond its territorial boundaries.Â  Under the historical strict \r\n  territorial principle, a state court had jurisdiction only over those crimes \r\n  which occurred entirely within that stateâ€™s boundaries; if any essential element \r\n  occurred in another state, neither possessed jurisdiction over the criminal \r\n  offense.Â  Under this view of jurisdiction, only one state could have jurisdiction \r\n  over a particular crime.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Darroch, 287 S.E.2d 856, 860 (N.C. 1982) \r\n  (citations omitted); In re Vasquez, 705 N.E.2d 606, 610 (Mass. 1999) \r\n  (â€œThe general rule, accepted as â€˜axiomaticâ€™ by the courts in this country, is \r\n  that a State may not prosecute an individual for a crime committed outside its \r\n  boundaries.â€).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court expanded the concept \r\n  of strict territorial jurisdiction in Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280 \r\n  (1911).Â  In Strassheim, Daily, an Illinois resident, was indicted in \r\n  Michigan for bribery and obtaining money from the State by false pretenses based \r\n  on misrepresentations with respect to secondhand machinery he sold to the State \r\n  of Michigan.Â  The Governor of Illinois responded to Michiganâ€™s request for a \r\n  warrant that extradited Daily to Michigan.Â  Daily filed a petition for habeas \r\n  corpus.Â  At the hearing, Daily presented evidence that he was in Chicago, Illinois, \r\n  when the money was obtained from Michigan and never entered the state until \r\n  the fraud was complete.Â  The person who received the funds, a warden in a Michigan \r\n  prison, had agreed to assist Daily in defrauding the State.Â  The district court \r\n  granted the petition, finding the facts alleged in the indictment did not constitute \r\n  a crime against the laws of Michigan.Â  The Supreme Court reversed the order \r\n  granting the petition.Â  The Court held Michigan could prosecute Daily, reasoning \r\n  â€œ[a]cts done outside a jurisdiction, but intended to produce and producing detrimental \r\n  effects within it, justify a state in punishing the cause of the harm as if \r\n  he had been present at the effect, if the state should succeed in getting him \r\n  within its power.â€Â  Id. at 285.Â  \r\n Decisions from other jurisdictions have repeatedly \r\n  recognized the doctrine set forth in Strassheim.Â  See, e.g., People \r\n  v. Blume, 505 N.W.2d 843, 845 (Mich. 1993) (â€œThe authority to exercise jurisdiction \r\n  over acts that occur outside the stateâ€™s physical borders developed as an exception \r\n  to the rule against extraterritorial jurisdiction.Â  That exception, however, \r\n  is â€˜limited to those acts that are intended to have, and that actually do have, \r\n  a detrimental effect within the state.â€™â€ (quoting Strassheim, 221 U.S. \r\n  at 285)); Keselica v. Commonwealth, 480 S.E.2d 756, 758 (Va. Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (recognizing â€œResult Theoryâ€ enunciated in Strassheim); Rios, \r\n  733 P.2d at 249 (referencing Strassheim and stating â€œa state could criminalize \r\n  acts which occurred outside the state if they produced an effect within the \r\n  stateâ€); In re Vasquez, 705 N.E.2d at 610 (recognizing â€œeffectsâ€ doctrine \r\n  established in Strassheim and stating â€œa State is not deprived of jurisdiction \r\n  over every criminal case in which the defendant was not physically present within \r\n  the Stateâ€™s borders when the crime was committedâ€); see generally R.P.D., \r\n  Annotation, Absence From State at Time of Offense as Affecting Jurisdiction \r\n  of Offense, 42 A.L.R. 272 (1926).Â  \r\nOther states have adopted the Strassheim doctrine \r\n  by enacting a jurisdictional statute.Â  See 4 Wayne R. LaFave et al., \r\n  Criminal Procedure Â§ 16.4(c), at 579 (2d ed. 1999) (â€œA substantial majority \r\n  of the states today have statutes that adopt an interpretation of the territorial \r\n  principle substantially more expansive than the traditional common law position.â€); \r\n  see, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 13-108(A) (West 2001); Fla. Stat. \r\n  Ann. Â§ 910.005(1) (West 2001); 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-5 (West 2002); \r\n  Minn. Stat. Ann. Â§ 609.025 (West 1987); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Â§ 2901.11(A) (Anderson \r\n  2002); Utah Code Ann. Â§ 76-1-201 (1999).Â Â  \r\nAlthough states with a specific legislative enactment \r\n  certainly more clearly define a stateâ€™s jurisdictional power over criminal conduct \r\n  outside of its territorial borders, the absence of a state jurisdictional statute \r\n  is not dispositive.Â  See Rios, 733 P.2d at 249 (â€œWhile Wyoming \r\n  does not have a specific statute which permits the exercise of jurisdiction \r\n  when extraterritorial conduct causes a result in this state, the concept articulated \r\n  in Strassheim v. Daily, supra, does not depend upon the existence of \r\n  such a statute.â€); In re Vasquez, 705 N.E.2d at 610 (holding, in the \r\n  absence of a state jurisdictional statute, a state is not precluded from relying \r\n  on rule in Strassheim, given â€œStrassheim Court itself made no \r\n  reference to the need for such a statutory provisionâ€).Â Â  Thus, the absence \r\n  of a South Carolina statute does not prohibit this Stateâ€™s prosecution of out-of-state \r\n  criminal conduct. [3]   \r\nIn a case that pre-dates Strassheim, South Carolina \r\n  addressed the concept of extraterritorial jurisdiction, particularly the â€œeffects \r\n  doctrine.â€Â  State v. Morrow, 40 S.C. 221, 18 S.E. 853 (1893).Â  In Morrow, \r\n  the defendant was indicted pursuant to a South Carolina statute for the offense \r\n  of procuring medicine for a woman with intent to cause an abortion.Â  The defendant, \r\n  a resident of Washington, D.C., procured the medication and mailed it to the \r\n  woman in South Carolina.Â  The womanâ€™s use of the medication resulted in an abortion, \r\n  and ultimately the womanâ€™s death.Â  Because the defendantâ€™s overt acts took place \r\n  in Washington, D.C., the Supreme Court considered the question of whether South \r\n  Carolina had jurisdiction for the charged offense. \r\n  [4] Â  The Court implicitly recognized the â€œeffects doctrine,â€ stating South \r\n  Carolina would have jurisdiction over Morrowâ€™s acts in the District of Columbia \r\n  â€œif the acts there done were intended to take effect in this State, and did \r\n  there actually take effect . . . .â€Â  Id. at 237, 18 S.E. at 859.Â  Although \r\n  the Court acknowledged that courts of one state could not take jurisdiction \r\n  of offenses committed in another state, it considered the question of whether \r\n  Morrowâ€™s offense â€œwas, in the eye of the law, committed within the limits of \r\n  this State.â€Â  Id. at 241, 18 S.E. at 860.Â  Applying this analysis, the \r\n  Court concluded Morrow committed an offense within South Carolina, given Morrowâ€™s \r\n  acts â€œprovided the effect thereby intended reached the person for whom it was \r\n  intended while in this State.â€Â  Id.Â  at 238, 18 S.E. at 859.\r\nIn 1939, post-Strassheim, our Supreme Court \r\n  again addressed this doctrine in State v. Farne, 190 S.C. 75, 1 S.E.2d \r\n  912 (1939).Â  In that case, Farne was convicted of uttering a forged bank check \r\n  and his co-defendant, Kennedy, was convicted of accessory before the fact.Â  \r\n  Kennedy moved to quash the indictment charging him with accessory before the \r\n  fact, arguing the alleged offense was committed â€œboth within and without the \r\n  State.â€Â  Id. at 82, 1 S.E.2d at 915.Â  The indictment alleged the conduct \r\n  for this charge occurred in Anderson County as well as Asheville, North Carolina, \r\n  and Nashville, Tennessee.Â  Kennedy asserted â€œif a person outside of this State \r\n  procures a felony to be committed in this State by a criminal agent, he is an \r\n  accessory before the fact, and should be tried in the State where he instigates \r\n  the crime, and not in the State where such crime is committed by the principal.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 83, 1 S.E.2d at 915.Â  Our Supreme Court affirmed Kennedyâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\n  The Court found Kennedyâ€™s conduct took place beyond the limits of Anderson County \r\n  but also in Anderson County where the crime was completed.Â  Even though Kennedy \r\n  was absent from South Carolina at the time of the offense, he counseled Farne \r\n  with the intent that the offense be committed within South Carolina.Â  The Court \r\n  reasoned:\r\n\r\nAlthough the general rule is that a State or sovereignty \r\n  cannot punish for offenses committed beyond its territorial limits, it may pass \r\n  laws in regard to its own citizens which will be binding and obligatory on them \r\n  when they are beyond such limits, and for the violation of which they may be \r\n  punished in its Courts, whenever it can find them within its jurisdictions.Â  \r\n  Aside from this, where a person, being beyond the limits of a State or Country, \r\n  puts in operation a force which produces a result and constitutes a crime \r\n  within those limits, he is as liable to indictment and punishment, if jurisdiction \r\n  can be obtained of his person, as if he had been within the limits of the State \r\n  or Country when the crime was committed.\r\n\r\nFarne, 190 S.C. at 83, 1 S.E.2d at 915 (citations \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nAlthough the Strassheim doctrine has received \r\n  limited application by our appellate courts, it has been recognized and adopted \r\n  as a basis for jurisdiction over criminal conduct outside the territorial borders \r\n  of South Carolina.Â  \r\nC.\r\nAs evident from the foregoing discussion, the concept of \r\n  extraterritorial jurisdiction is applicable to the instant case.Â  Dudley, however, \r\n  did not raise this specific jurisdictional challenge to the circuit court or \r\n  for that matter in her initial appeal.Â  In light of this procedural defect, \r\n  we must determine whether extraterritorial jurisdiction is a component of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction that can be raised sua sponte by this Court.Â  \r\n  Because our research reveals no South Carolina case directly addressing this \r\n  issue, we are guided by decisions of other jurisdictions and the analysis of \r\n  secondary authorities.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Massachusetts thoroughly analyzed \r\n  this issue in a habeas corpus case.Â  In re Vasquez, 705 N.E.2d 606 (Mass. \r\n  1999).Â  Vasquez, a Massachusetts resident, was divorced in 1985 and ordered \r\n  to pay child support for his two children.Â  In 1987, Vasquezâ€™s ex-wife and two \r\n  children relocated to Oregon without his knowledge.Â  Vasquez never went to Oregon \r\n  and failed to make child support payments.Â  As a result, Vasquezâ€™s ex-wife filed \r\n  a reciprocal support petition in Oregon under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement \r\n  Support Act.Â  Because authorities in Massachusetts were unable to locate Vasquez \r\n  to compel payment, Oregon authorities obtained an indictment against him for \r\n  non-support.Â  Pursuant to a warrant issued by the Governor of Massachusetts, \r\n  at the extradition request of the Governor of Oregon, Vasquez was arrested.Â  \r\n  Vasquez filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the constitutionality \r\n  of the restraint of his liberty pending extradition.Â  Vasquez appealed the denial \r\n  of his petition to the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.\r\nOn appeal, Vasquez primarily claimed the courts \r\n  of Oregon did not have personal jurisdiction over him and, therefore, the Oregon \r\n  indictment was invalid.Â  Initially, the Court dismissed Vasquezâ€™s claim that \r\n  the minimum contacts analysis applicable to personal jurisdiction in civil matters \r\n  also governed criminal cases.Â  The Court specifically found â€œ[t]he cases dealing \r\n  with personal jurisdiction address issues quite inapposite to the context of \r\n  a criminal case.â€Â  Id. at 609.Â  The Court reasoned:\r\n\r\nThe leading cases, International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \r\n  326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945), and World-Wide Volkswagen \r\n  Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed.2d 490 (1980), \r\n  dealt with the question whether the courts of one jurisdiction could render \r\n  a judgment that was valid and binding against a defendant everywhere and so \r\n  could be carried to another State, where enforcement could be had under the \r\n  full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution.Â  Art. IV, Â§ \r\n  I.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Therefore, the Court concluded â€œ[t]he jurisprudence \r\n  of personal jurisdiction has no bearing on the question whether a person may \r\n  be brought to a State and tried there for crimes under that Stateâ€™s laws.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The Court further stated, â€œ[s]uch a claim is not barred by the fact \r\n  of an individualâ€™s presence within the prosecuting State.â€Â  Id.  \r\nSeveral other jurisdictions concur with the analysis \r\n  of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.Â  See, e.g., Black v. State, \r\n  819 So. 2d 208 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2002) (holding Florida acquired personal \r\n  jurisdiction over out-of-state defendant for RICO offenses where defendant appeared \r\n  at trial, and also analyzing the question of whether Florida had subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over the defendantâ€™s actions committed outside the State of Florida); \r\n  State v. Amoroso, 975 P.2d 505 (Utah Ct. App. 1999) (recognizing, in \r\n  case to prosecute a nonresident corporate defendant for violations of Utahâ€™s \r\n  Alcohol Beverage and Control Act, the concept of minimum contacts has no application \r\n  in criminal cases; holding Utah acquired personal jurisdiction through defendantâ€™s \r\n  physical presence at the trial; concluding Utah had subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  given defendantâ€™s conduct constituting an element of the offense occurred within \r\n  the state); Rios, 733 P.2d at 244 (finding question of whether State \r\n  of Wyoming had jurisdiction to prosecute out-of-state defendant for interfering \r\n  with child custody in Wyoming was a question of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  and not personal jurisdiction given defendant appeared at trial; recognizing \r\n  the concept of minimum contacts has no application in criminal cases).\r\nWe also note that several jurisdictions, including \r\n  South Carolina, have implicitly recognized that an out-of-state defendant, who \r\n  appears at trial, may still challenge a courtâ€™s lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Morrow, 40 S.C. at 237, 18 S.E. at 859 (stating out-of-state \r\n  defendant submits to personal jurisdiction in prosecuting state where he voluntarily \r\n  returns, but Stateâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction over defendantâ€™s out-of-state \r\n  conduct acquired where effect intended for the prosecuting state); Moreno \r\n  v. Baskerville, 452 S.E.2d 653 (Va. 1995) (addressing for the first time \r\n  in a petition for habeas corpus the issue of whether Virginia had jurisdiction \r\n  to prosecute out-of-state defendant for crime of drug trafficking committed \r\n  in Arizona).Â  \r\nBased on this authority, we conclude Dudleyâ€™s jurisdictional \r\n  challenge is properly viewed as one of subject matter jurisdiction and more \r\n  specifically, as one of extraterritorial jurisdiction.Â  Thus, it may be raised \r\n  at any time, including for the first time on appeal.Â  See 4 Wayne R. \r\n  LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure Â§ 16.4(d), at 591 (2d ed. 1999) (â€œ[I]f \r\n  the trial record establishes that the acts and consequences occurred at places \r\n  that would put the crime outside of the stateâ€™s jurisdiction, that object can \r\n  first be raised on appeal or even in a habeas petition if the convicted defendant \r\n  remains in custody.â€).\r\nII.\r\nApplying the concept of extraterritorial jurisdiction \r\n  to the instant case, we find no evidence that would support South Carolina exercising \r\n  jurisdiction over Dudley for either trafficking in cocaine or conspiracy to \r\n  traffic cocaine.Â  \r\nIn 1997, Dudley was charged with trafficking in \r\n  cocaine pursuant to section 44-53-370(e)(2)(d), which provides:\r\n\r\n(e) Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, cultivates, \r\n  delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance \r\n  or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, \r\n  cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State, or who is knowingly \r\n  in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly attempts to become in \r\n  actual or constructive possession of:\r\n* * *\r\n(2) ten grams or more of cocaine or any mixtures containing \r\n  cocaine, as provided in Section 44-53-210(b)(4), is guilty of a felony which \r\n  is known as â€œtrafficking in cocaineâ€ and, upon conviction, must be punished \r\n  as follows if the quantity involved is:\r\n* * *\r\n  \r\n(d) two hundred grams or more, but less than four hundred \r\n  grams, a mandatory term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, no part of which \r\n  may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of one hundred thousand dollars.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(d) (Supp. 1996) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â Â  Dudley was also charged with conspiracy to traffic cocaine \r\n  under this same code section.\r\nConspiracy is defined as the â€œcombination between \r\n  two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or lawful \r\n  object by unlawful means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003).Â  The gravamen \r\n  of conspiracy is an agreement or combination.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. \r\n  124, 133-34, 437 S.E.2d 75, 80 (1993).Â Â  â€œThe overt acts committed in furtherance \r\n  of the conspiracy are not elements of the crime.Â  Under South Carolina law, \r\n  a conspiracy does not require overt acts.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. \r\n  289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 867-68 (1993); see State v. Buckmon, \r\n  347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001) (stating a conspiracy may be proven \r\n  by the specific overt acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy but the crime \r\n  is the agreement). â€œTo establish the existence of a conspiracy, proof of an \r\n  express agreement is not necessary, and direct evidence is not essential, but \r\n  the conspiracy may be sufficiently shown by circumstantial evidence and the \r\n  conduct of the parties.â€Â  Buckmon, 347 S.C. at 323, 555 S.E.2d at 405.Â  \r\n  â€œIt is sufficient to show that each defendant knew or had reason to know of \r\n  the scope of the conspiracy and that each defendant had reason to believe his \r\n  own benefits were dependent upon the success of the entire venture.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Barroso, 320 S.C. 1, 8-9, 462 S.E.2d 862, 868 (Ct. App. 1995), revâ€™d \r\n  on other grounds, 328 S.C. 268, 493 S.E.2d 854 (1997).Â  \r\nIn order for South Carolina to exercise jurisdiction \r\n  over the two offenses, the critical determination is whether Dudley â€œintended \r\n  a detrimental effect to occur in this state.â€Â  Blume, 505 N.W.2d \r\n  at 846.Â  â€œThe two key elements of that requirement are specific intent to act \r\n  and the intent that the harm occur in [South Carolina].â€ Id.Â  \r\nHere, both Stokes and Hale were Virginia residents \r\n  who telephoned Dudley in Georgia.Â  The entire drug transaction took place in \r\n  Georgia.Â  In Haleâ€™s written statement, he noted he and Stokes left Georgia and \r\n  â€œgot on 85 north towards [Virginia].â€Â  In Stokesâ€™s statement, he admitted he \r\n  normally purchased drugs from someone in Virginia, but contacted Dudley in Atlanta \r\n  to make a â€œdope runâ€ because of the â€œdry spellsâ€ in Virginia.Â  Stokes also testified \r\n  he and Hale left for Virginia the same day they purchased the cocaine in Georgia.Â  \r\n  Additionally, Hale specifically acknowledged he and Stokes intended to sell \r\n  the cocaine in Virginia. \r\nAlthough Dudley may have thought that Stokes and Hale would \r\n  most likely travel through South Carolina on their way back to Virginia, any \r\n  inference is speculative given there is no evidence of Dudleyâ€™s knowledge of \r\n  her co-conspiratorsâ€™ route.Â  Furthermore, this inference or Dudleyâ€™s mere knowledge \r\n  is not sufficient to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction in this State. \r\n  The prosecutor must have presented evidence that Dudley entered into the conspiracy \r\n  and engaged in the sale with the intent to have a detrimental effect within \r\n  South Carolina.Â  See Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 844 (â€œ[K]nowledge alone \r\n  is not enough to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.Â  The prosecutor must \r\n  present evidence that defendant intended to commit an act with the intent \r\n  to have a detrimental effect within this state.â€).\r\nThe officersâ€™ traffic stop and ultimate search \r\n  of Haleâ€™s and Stokesâ€™s vehicle can only be construed as an intervening act, \r\n  rather than an overt act necessary to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  See State v. Palermo, 579 P.2d 718, 720 (Kan. 1978) (â€œ[A] state \r\n  does not have jurisdiction over an individual for a crime committed within that \r\n  state when he was located outside the state, did not intend to commit a crime \r\n  within the state, and could not reasonably foresee that his act would cause, \r\n  aid or abet in the commission of a crime within that state.â€).Â  To hold otherwise \r\n  would vest any state along a co-conspiratorâ€™s route, however circuitous, with \r\n  jurisdiction over acts committed outside its state limits.Â  This analysis would \r\n  essentially eviscerate the â€œeffects doctrine.â€\r\nWe find the only evidence is that Dudley, Stokes, \r\n  and Hale conspired and conducted the drug transaction in Georgia.Â  In terms \r\n  of the conspiracy charge, the agreement itself constituted the crime, which \r\n  was completed in Georgia.Â  The financial benefit derived by Dudley was also \r\n  completed in Georgia and was not dependent on the subsequent acts of Hale and \r\n  Stokes.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence that Dudley intended for her acts \r\n  to create a detrimental effect within South Carolina. \r\n  [5] Â  As such, South Carolina could not exercise jurisdiction over Dudley \r\n  for conspiracy to traffic cocaine or trafficking in cocaine.Â  See State \r\n  v. McAdams, 167 S.C. 405, 166 S.E. 405 (1932) (holding in order for South \r\n  Carolina to prosecute Georgia defendant for conspiracy entered into in Georgia, \r\n  but completed in South Carolina, the State was required to prove that some overt \r\n  act was committed in South Carolina by one of the conspirators pursuant to the \r\n  conspiracy); see also State v. King, 211 S.C. 1, 43 S.E.2d 596 \r\n  (1947) (concluding South Carolina was without jurisdiction to prosecute for \r\n  swindling assignees of a contract for South Carolina land, who defaulted on \r\n  the contract with vendor and thus did not own the property, where all parties \r\n  to the contract were residents of North Carolina, the contracts were signed \r\n  in North Carolina, all payments with one exception were paid in North Carolina, \r\n  and the only overt act in South Carolina was the parties viewing the premises \r\n  prior to signing the contracts).Â  \r\nÂ Furthermore, a review of the language of the statute \r\n  under which Dudley was charged supports our conclusion.Â  Both offenses under \r\n  section 44-53-370(e)(2)(d) require a specific intent to bring cocaine â€œinto \r\n  this State.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(d) (Supp. 1996).Â  In terms of \r\n  the trafficking charge, Dudley must have intended to aid and abet the bringing \r\n  of cocaine into South Carolina.Â  See State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. \r\n  133, 137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1987) (stating â€œ[i]n order to be guilty as an \r\n  aider or abettor, the participant must be chargeable with knowledge of the principalâ€™s \r\n  criminal conductâ€); Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 852 (â€œOne who aids and abets \r\n  the commission of a substantive crime that occurs in Michigan is not automatically \r\n  subject to trial in Michigan.Â  Defendant must have intended to aid and abet \r\n  a crime in Michigan.Â  Mere knowledge is not enough to exercise jurisdiction.â€).Â  \r\n  As to the conspiracy charge, Dudley must have knowingly conspired to bring cocaine \r\n  into South Carolina.Â  See Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at \r\n  80-81 (holding in order to establish a conspiracy â€œâ€˜[w]hat is needed is proof \r\n  they intended to act together for their shared mutual benefit-within \r\n  the scope of the conspiracy chargedâ€™â€ (quoting United States v. Evans, \r\n  970 F.2d 663, 671 (10th Cir.1992))).Â  There is no evidence that Dudley intended \r\n  for the cocaine to be brought into South Carolina. \r\n  [6] \r\nBecause there is no evidence that Dudleyâ€™s conduct \r\n  fits within the ambit of section 44-53-370(e)(2)(d), South Carolina was without \r\n  jurisdiction to prosecute her.Â  See State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. \r\n  264, 268, 559 S.E.2d 847, 849 (2002) (stating appellate courts are â€œbound to \r\n  construe a penal statute strictly against the State and in favor of the defendantâ€); \r\n  William Shepard McAninch &amp; W. Gaston Fairey, The Criminal Law of South \r\n  Carolina 94 (4th ed. 2002) (â€œUnless the defendantâ€™s conduct is encompassed \r\n  within the reach of the statute under which he is charged, the court lacks subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to try him.â€).Â  \r\nThis conclusion is consistent with other jurisdictions. \r\n  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fafone, 621 N.E.2d 1178 (Mass. 1993) \r\n  (finding Massachusetts lacked territorial jurisdiction over crime of accessory \r\n  before the fact of trafficking in cocaine where alleged criminal acts took place \r\n  in Florida and there was no evidence Florida defendant knew cocaine would be \r\n  distributed within Massachusetts); Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 848-52 (concluding \r\n  Michigan did not have extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute Florida defendant \r\n  for conspiracy to deliver or possession with intent to deliver more than 650 \r\n  grams of cocaine, and aiding and abetting the manufacture or possession with \r\n  intent to manufacture or deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine, where entire \r\n  sale to Michigan resident took place in Florida and there was no evidence defendant \r\n  acted with intent to have a detrimental effect in Michigan); Moreno, \r\n  452 S.E.2d at 655 (concluding Virginia did not have jurisdiction to try defendant \r\n  for drug trafficking committed in Arizona, even though drugs were eventually \r\n  sold in Virginia, where sale of drugs in Virginia was not â€œimmediate resultâ€ \r\n  of distribution of drugs in Arizona); cf. State v. Chan, 935 P.2d \r\n  850 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1996) (finding Arizona had jurisdiction to prosecute out-of-state \r\n  defendants for conspiracy to commit theft and attempted trafficking where in-state \r\n  co-conspiratorâ€™s overt actions of driving into and participating in the actual \r\n  â€œsaleâ€ within the State of Arizona could be imputed to the defendants); Black, \r\n  819 So. 2d at 210-12 (holding Florida had subject matter jurisdiction to try \r\n  out-of-state defendant for RICO offenses, communications fraud, and conspiracy \r\n  to commit RICO offenses where out-of-state defendant made telephone sales calls \r\n  and sent faxes to Florida county for purpose of defrauding county); People \r\n  v. Govin, 572 N.E.2d 450 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (concluding charge of trafficking \r\n  in cocaine properly brought in Illinois where Florida defendant acted with intent \r\n  that cocaine be delivered in Illinois, and aided and abetted a transaction through \r\n  an Illinois confidential informant by which cocaine was caused to be delivered \r\n  in Illinois); State v. Campa, 2002 WL 471174 (Ohio Ct. App. 2002) (finding, \r\n  in a drug-trafficking case, an offer to sell drugs over the telephone to a person \r\n  in Ohio was sufficient to establish jurisdiction in Ohio even if the person \r\n  offering to sell the drugs was outside the state); see generally B.C. \r\n  Ricketts, Annotation, Jurisdiction to Prosecute Conspirator Who was Not in \r\n  State at Time of Substantive Criminal Act, For Offense Committed Pursuant to \r\n  Conspiracy, 5 A.L.R.3d 887 (1966 &amp; Supp. 2002). \r\nAlthough we recognize this Stateâ€™s legitimate \r\n  interest in protecting its citizens from the societal effects of drug trafficking, \r\n  this alone is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction.Â  We would note the absence \r\n  of jurisdiction in South Carolina does not preclude the prosecution of Dudleyâ€™s \r\n  actions.Â  Under the facts of this case, we believe either Georgia or Virginia \r\n  would have jurisdiction.Â  Cf. Marquez v. State, 12 P.3d 711 (Wyo. \r\n  2000) (holding Wyoming had jurisdiction to prosecute defendant for drug conspiracy \r\n  where defendant entered into the conspiracy in New Mexico, was arrested pursuant \r\n  to a traffic violation in Colorado, but intended for the conspiracy to have \r\n  an effect within the State of Wyoming); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 \r\n  (2002) (â€œIf a violation of this article [Article 3, Narcotics and Controlled \r\n  Substances] is a violation of a Federal law or the law of another state, the \r\n  conviction or acquittal under Federal law or the law of another state for the \r\n  same act is a bar to prosecution in this State.â€).\r\nBecause the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, we vacate \r\n  both of Dudleyâ€™s convictions. [7] \r\n  Â  See State v. Funderburk, 259 S.C. 256, 261, 191 S.E.2d 520, \r\n  522 (1972) (stating â€œthe acts of a court with respect to a matter as to which \r\n  it has no jurisdiction are voidâ€).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the common law concept of extraterritorial \r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Because extraterritorial jurisdiction is a component of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction, it may be raised for the first time on appeal or sua \r\n  sponte by an appellate court.Â  Based on the facts of this case, South \r\n  Carolina lacked jurisdiction over Dudley for the offenses of trafficking in \r\n  cocaine and conspiracy to traffic cocaine.Â  Accordingly, we vacate both of her \r\n  convictions.\r\nVACATED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON, J., HUFF, J., HOWARD, J. and SHULER, \r\n  J., concur.Â  ANDERSON, J. and GOOLSBY, J., dissent.Â  STILWELL, J., concurs in \r\n  part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\r\n ANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  I respectfully dissent.Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  \r\n  The holding of the majority misconstrues and misapplies the law extant in regard \r\n  to: (1) personal jurisdiction; (2) subject matter jurisdiction; and (3) extraterritorial \r\n  jurisdiction.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM the conviction for trafficking \r\n  cocaine.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn September 10, 1997, Officer \r\n  Matthew Durham of the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Department noticed a vehicle \r\n  weaving along Interstate 85 and making an improper lane change.Â  Durham stopped \r\n  the car and asked driver Earl Hale to exit the vehicle.Â  Hale told Officer Durham \r\n  that he was returning from a party in Atlanta.Â  Passenger Donald Stokes told \r\n  Durham that the two were returning from a funeral in Atlanta.Â  After talking \r\n  with Hale and giving him a warning, Durham asked Hale if he could search the \r\n  vehicle.Â  During his conversation with Hale, Durham allowed Stokes to exit the \r\n  car.Â  Hale gave Durham permission to search the vehicle.Â  Deputy James Littleton \r\n  spoke with Hale and Stokes while Durham proceeded with the search.Â  Durham found \r\n  in the trunk of the vehicle a paper bag containing a ziplock bag wrapped in \r\n  a clear plastic bag.Â  The ziplock bag contained cocaine.Â  Hale and Stokes attempted \r\n  to escape, but they were apprehended by the officers.\r\nHale and Stokes, who were both from Virginia, gave voluntary \r\n  statements to the police.Â  In Stokesâ€™ statement, he indicated he was acquainted \r\n  with Dudley, who lived in Atlanta, and that Dudley knew where to obtain large \r\n  amounts of cocaine.Â  According to the statements of both men, Hale and Stokes \r\n  traveled to Atlanta, partied at a gentlemenâ€™s club, and then contacted Dudley \r\n  the next morning.Â  Dudley met with the two men, who gave her a total of $5,000 \r\n  to take to her supplier.Â  Thereafter, Dudley returned to Hale and Stokesâ€™ hotel \r\n  to deliver the cocaine.Â  Hale and Stokes were planning to sell the drugs in \r\n  their home state of Virginia, but they were stopped in Anderson County, South \r\n  Carolina, before they could make it home.\r\nHale and Stokes agreed to assist police \r\n  officers in prosecuting narcotics cases in South Carolina and Virginia.Â  They \r\n  began working with the Drug Enforcement Agency.Â  While agents were monitoring \r\n  and recording the conversations, Stokes made several telephone calls to Dudley \r\n  to set up another cocaine purchase.Â  Stokes asked Dudley to meet him in South \r\n  Carolina, but she refused.Â  Dudley finally agreed to meet Stokes in Atlanta.Â  \r\n  She was arrested in Atlanta and charged for her actions in providing to Stokes \r\n  and Hale the cocaine, which was confiscated in Anderson County.\r\nHale and Stokes both testified against \r\n  Dudley at her trial.Â  Hale stated that Dudley supplied the cocaine to him and \r\n  he intended to resell it.Â  Stokes declared that Dudley brought them nine ounces \r\n  of cocaine to their hotel.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDudley contends the Circuit Court lacked \r\n  jurisdiction to prosecute her in South Carolina because she never entered the \r\n  state.Â  I disagree.\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nDudley never entered South Carolina \r\n  during her transaction with Hale and Stokes.Â  The indictment charging Dudley \r\n  with trafficking stated that Dudley â€œdid in Anderson County, South Carolina \r\n  on or about September 10, 1997 traffic in cocaine by aiding and abetting the \r\n  bringing into the State of South Carolina 200 or more grams of cocaine.â€\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power \r\n  of a court to hear and determine cases of a general class to which the proceedings \r\n  in question belong.Â  City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  492 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A Circuit Court acquires subject matter jurisdiction over \r\n  a criminal matter if: (1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states \r\n  the offense; (2) the defendant has waived presentment of the indictment; or \r\n  (3) the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  \r\n  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002); State v. Timmons, \r\n  349 S.C. 389, 563 S.E.2d 657 (2002); State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d 511 (2001).\r\nQuestions regarding subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can \r\n  be raised sua sponte by the court.Â  State v. Brown, Op. \r\n  No. 3549 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. 9, 2002)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32 at 52); \r\n  see also State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (holding issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at \r\n  any time).Â  Furthermore, lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, \r\n  even by consent of the parties, and should be taken notice of by this Court.Â  \r\n  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001).\r\nAn indictment is sufficient to confer \r\n  jurisdiction if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to \r\n  know what he is called upon to answer.Â  Lynch, 344 S.C. at 639, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  at 513; Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995).Â  In South \r\n  Carolina, an indictment â€œshall be deemed and judged sufficient and good in law \r\n  which, in addition to allegations as to time and place, as required by law, \r\n  charges the crime substantially in the language of the common law or of the \r\n  statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged \r\n  may be easily understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, that the \r\n  offense be alleged to be contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (1985).Â  An indictment must: (1) enumerate all the \r\n  elements of the charged offense, regardless of whether it is a statutory or \r\n  common law offense; and (2) recite the factual circumstances under which the \r\n  offense occurred.Â  Id.; State v. Evans, 322 S.C. 78, 470 S.E.2d \r\n  97 (1996). Â Thus, an indictment passes legal muster if it charges the crime \r\n  substantially in the language of the statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly \r\n  that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood.Â  State v. \r\n  Reddick, 348 S.C. 631, 560 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nTo convey jurisdiction, an indictment \r\n  must apprise the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged \r\n  and inform the defendant of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend.Â  \r\n  Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 533 S.E.2d 324 (2000); Carter v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998); see also Browning, 320 S.C. \r\n  at 368, 465 S.E.2d at 359 (true test of sufficiency of indictment is not whether \r\n  it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains necessary \r\n  elements of offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises defendant \r\n  of what he must be prepared to meet).Â  An indictment phrased substantially in \r\n  the language of the statute which creates and defines the offense is ordinarily \r\n  sufficient.Â  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 (1981).Â  \r\n  South Carolina courts have held that the sufficiency of an indictment must be \r\n  viewed with a practical eye.Â  State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d \r\n  582 (1981), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 \r\n  S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nDudley was charged in 1997 with trafficking \r\n  cocaine pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(d) (Supp. 1996).Â  This \r\n  section provides:\r\n\r\n  Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, cultivates, \r\n  delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance \r\n  or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, \r\n  cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into this State, or who is knowingly \r\n  in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly attempts to become in \r\n  actual or constructive possession of:\r\n. . . .\r\n  ten grams or more of cocaine or any mixtures containing \r\n  cocaine, as provided in Section 44-53-210(b)(4), is guilty of a felony which \r\n  is known as â€œtrafficking in cocaineâ€ and, upon conviction, must be punished \r\n  as follows if the quantity involved is:\r\n. . . .\r\n  two hundred grams or more, but less than four hundred \r\n  grams, a mandatory term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, no part of which \r\n  may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of one hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nDudley does not complain that her indictments \r\n  were invalid.Â  Here, the indictments gave the time, place, and manner of the \r\n  events in which Dudley was accused of having participated.Â  The indictments \r\n  â€œcharge[d] the crime[s] substantially in the language of the . . . statute prohibiting \r\n  the crime[s].â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (1985).Â  The statute is broad and \r\n  plenary.Â  Additionally, the statute is imbued with specificity in regard to \r\n  acts and conduct consisting of â€œotherwise aids, abets, attemptsâ€ and â€œbring \r\n  into this State.â€Â  Id.\r\nMoreover, both indictments apprised Dudley of the \r\n  charges against her and the circumstances she must be prepared to defend.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the indictments contained the necessary elements of the offenses charged and \r\n  informed the Circuit Court of the sentence to pronounce.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over these crimes attached when valid indictments were issued by the grand jury.Â  \r\n  Concomitantly, the indictments in the present case conferred subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction on the Circuit Court to try Dudley.\r\nII.Â  Personal Jurisdiction\r\nAlthough Dudley couched her issue on appeal \r\n  as a question of subject matter jurisdiction, she actually complains that the \r\n  Circuit Court lacked personal jurisdiction over her.\r\nGenerally, jurisdiction of the person \r\n  is acquired when the party charged is arrested or voluntarily appears in court \r\n  and submits himself to its jurisdiction.Â  State v. Douglas, 245 S.C. \r\n  83, 138 S.E.2d 845 (1964); State v. Langford, 223 S.C. 20, 73 S.E.2d \r\n  854 (1953).Â  A defendant may waive any complaints he may have regarding personal \r\n  jurisdiction by failing to object to the lack of personal jurisdiction and by \r\n  appearing to defend his case.Â  See State v. Bethea, 88 S.C. 515, \r\n  70 S.E. 11 (1911); see also State v. Castleman, 219 S.C. 136, \r\n  138-39, 64 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1951) (â€œA defendant may, of course, waive his objection \r\n  to the jurisdiction of the Court over his person . . . .â€); Town of Ridgeland \r\n  v. Gens, 83 S.C. 562, 65 S.E. 828 (1909) (the court found no personal jurisdiction \r\n  problem where the defendant appeared for his trial, was represented by an attorney, \r\n  and defended his case on the merits). \r\n In the instant case, Dudley appeared at \r\n  trial and defended her case on the merits.Â  She did not object to personal jurisdiction \r\n  before the Circuit Court.Â  As she consented to the Circuit Courtâ€™s exercise \r\n  of personal jurisdiction over her and did not raise any objection, Dudley failed \r\n  to preserve this issue for review.Â  See State v. Lee, 350 S.C. \r\n  125, 564 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 2002) (issue must be raised to and ruled upon \r\n  by trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â  Because this issue was \r\n  not preserved, it is improper for this Court to consider it on appeal.\r\nIII.Â  Exercise of \r\n  Extraterritorial Jurisdiction by South Carolina\r\nFacially and legally, this Court has subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction by virtue of a valid indictment under South Carolina precedent.Â  \r\n  That conclusion does not end the inquiry.Â  It is essential to analyze the exercise \r\n  of extraterritorial jurisdiction over acts committed outside the state by Dudley.\r\n â€œIt is elementary that before a court \r\n  may exercise judicial power to hear and determine a criminal prosecution, that \r\n  court must possess three types of jurisdiction: jurisdiction over the defendant, \r\n  jurisdiction over the alleged crime, and territorial jurisdiction.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Legg, 9 S.W.3d 111, 114 (Tenn. 1999) (emphasis added).\r\nThe general rule is that a state may not \r\n  prosecute an individual for a crime committed outside its boundaries.Â  In \r\n  re Vasquez, 705 N.E.2d 606 (Mass. 1999); see also People v. Blume, \r\n  505 N.W.2d 843 (Mich. 1993) (general rule is that jurisdiction is proper only \r\n  over offenses as may be committed within the prosecuting stateâ€™s jurisdiction).Â  \r\n  Yet, â€œblind adherence to a purely territorial concept of jurisdiction inadequately \r\n  addresses the stateâ€™s interest in protecting its citizens from the results of \r\n  criminal activity.â€Â  Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 845 n.6.\r\nDespite the general rule, a state is not deprived \r\n  of jurisdiction over every criminal case in which the defendant was not physically \r\n  present within the stateâ€™s borders when the crime was committed.Â  Vasquez, \r\n  705 N.E.2d at 610.Â  The authority to exercise jurisdiction over acts that occur \r\n  outside the stateâ€™s physical borders developed as an exception to the rule against \r\n  extraterritorial jurisdiction.Â  Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 845.Â  That exception, \r\n  however, is limited to those acts that are intended to have, and that actually \r\n  do have, a detrimental effect within the state.Â  Id.\r\nThe seminal case in this country elucidating \r\n  the right of a state to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction is Strassheim \r\n  v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 31 S.Ct. 558, 55 L.Ed. 735 (1911).Â  Strassheim \r\n  edifies:\r\n\r\nActs done outside a jurisdiction, but intended to produce \r\n  and producing detrimental effects within it, justify a state in punishing the \r\n  cause of the harm as if he had been present at the effect, if the state should \r\n  succeed in getting him within its power.Â  We may assume, therefore, that \r\n  Daily is a criminal under the laws of Michigan.\r\n  Of course, we must admit that it does not follow that Daily \r\n  is a fugitive from justice.Â  On the other hand, however, we think it plain that \r\n  the criminal need not do within the state every act necessary to complete the \r\n  crime.Â  If he does there an overt act which is and is intended to be a material \r\n  step toward accomplishing the crime, and then absents himself from the state \r\n  and does the rest elsewhere, he becomes a fugitive from justice when the crime \r\n  is complete, if not before.\r\n\r\nId. at 285, 31 S.Ct. at 560, 55 L.Ed. at \r\n  738 (citations omitted) (emphasis added); see also State v. Winckler, \r\n  260 N.W.2d 356 (S.D. 1977) (state jurisdiction properly lies when acts done \r\n  outside its jurisdiction are intended to produce and do produce a detrimental \r\n  effect within that jurisdiction).\r\nAn excellent academic explication of a \r\n  stateâ€™s extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is In re Vasquez, 705 \r\n  N.E.2d 606 (Mass. 1999).Â  Vasquez inculcates:\r\n\r\nThe general rule, accepted as â€œaxiomaticâ€ by the courts \r\n  in this country, is that a State may not prosecute an individual for a crime \r\n  committed outside its boundaries.Â  See, e.g., Neilsen v. Oregon, \r\n  212 U.S. 315, 321, 29 S.Ct. 383, 53 L.Ed. 528 (1909); Huntington v. Attrill, \r\n  146 U.S. 657, 673, 13 S.Ct. 224, 36 L.Ed. 1123 (1892); Commonwealth v. Booth, \r\n  266 Mass. 80, 84, 165 N.E. 29 (1929) (rule against extraterritorial application \r\n  of criminal laws â€œis a general principleâ€); State v. Cochran, 96 Idaho \r\n  862, 864, 538 P.2d 791 (1975); Trindle v. State, 326 Md. 25, 31, 602 \r\n  A.2d 1232 (1992); Blume, supra at 480, 505 N.W.2d 843; People \r\n  v. Devine, 185 Mich. 50, 52-53, 151 N.W. 646 (1915); State v. Karsten, \r\n  194 Neb. 227, 229, 231 N.W.2d 335 (1975); State v. Hall, 114 N.C. 909, \r\n  911, 19 S.E. 602 (1894) (rule is a â€œgeneral principle of universal acceptationâ€); \r\n  Ex parte McNeely, 36 W.Va. 84, 92, 14 S.E. 436 (1892); 21 Am. Jur. 2d \r\n  Â§ 343 (1981) (rule is â€œfundamentalâ€); Allen &amp; Ratnaswamy, Heath v. Alabama: \r\n  A Case Study of Doctrine and Rationality in the Supreme Court, 76 J. Crim. \r\n  L. &amp; Criminology 801, 815 n. 144 (1985). The source of this rule is unsettled \r\n  and has not been ascribed to any particular constitutional provision, see, \r\n  e.g., State ex rel. Juvenile Depâ€™t v. W., supra at 442 \r\n  n.5, 578 P.2d 824, yet it has been called by one commentator â€œtoo deeply embedded \r\n  in our law to require justification.â€Â  Laycock, Equal Citizens of Equal and \r\n  Territorial States: The Constitutional Foundations of Choice of Law, 92 \r\n  Colum. L. Rev. 249, 318 (1992).\r\nDespite this general rule, however, a State is not deprived \r\n  of jurisdiction over every criminal case in which the defendant was not physically \r\n  present within the Stateâ€™s borders when the crime was committed.Â  Two major \r\n  exceptions to the territorial principle might permit Oregon to exercise jurisdiction \r\n  over the defendant in this case, even though he has never been within its borders.\r\nThe â€œeffectsâ€ doctrine provides that â€œ[a]cts done outside \r\n  a jurisdiction, but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within \r\n  it, justify a State in punishing the cause of the harm as if he had been present \r\n  at the effect.â€Â  Strassheim v. Daily, supra at 285, 31 S.Ct. 558.Â  \r\n  The jurisdictional basis provided by Strassheim has been utilized by \r\n  a number of States to permit prosecution of individuals not within the State \r\n  at the time they violated the Stateâ€™s law . . \r\n. .\r\n\r\nId. at 610-11 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nThe exception to the rule against extraterritorial \r\n  jurisdiction requires a finding that the defendant intended a detrimental effect \r\n  to occur in this state.Â  Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 846.Â  The two key elements \r\n  of the requirement for exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction in the case \r\n  sub judice are specific intent to act and the intent that the \r\n  harm occur in South Carolina.Â  See Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 846.Â  \r\n  Some states refer to this exception as the â€œeffects doctrine.â€Â  See Vasquez, \r\n  705 N.E.2d at 610.Â  â€œAlthough some courts consider the effects doctrine to be \r\n  an exception to the general rule against extraterritorial jurisdiction, others \r\n  point out that it is not an exception at all, but a logical application of the \r\n  general rule in that the crime occurs where the effect is felt, not where the \r\n  offender is located.â€Â  Id. at 611 n.4.\r\nThe proper analysis to determine whether \r\n  extraterritorial jurisdiction can be exercised over trafficking in cocaine occurring \r\n  in another state is to consider whether the trafficking charge could be established \r\n  by the evidence.Â  Blume, 505 N.W.2d at 846.Â  Then, the Court must determine \r\n  whether the trafficking was intended to occur in South Carolina.Â  Id.\r\nA crime is committed where the criminal \r\n  act takes effect.Â  Simpson v. State, 17 S.E. 984 (Ga. 1893).Â  This is \r\n  true even though the accused is never actually present within the stateâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Winckler, 260 N.W.2d at 360.Â  One who puts in force an agency for the \r\n  commission of a crime is deemed to have accompanied the agency to the point \r\n  where it takes effect.Â  Id.Â  The state is then justified in punishing \r\n  the cause of the harm as if he were in fact present at the effect should the \r\n  state ever succeed in getting him within its power.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court should not approve the exercise \r\n  of jurisdiction over Dudley unless the State can prove that Dudley intended \r\n  the crime to occur in South Carolina.\r\nA thorough review of the testimony discloses that Dudley \r\n  transferred over 200 grams of cocaine to Stokes and Hale that they intended \r\n  to sell.Â  Dudley played an integral part in providing the cocaine that was brought \r\n  into South Carolina.Â  Giving efficacy to the law of circumstantial evidence \r\n  in this state, it is inferable that Stokes and Hale intended to possess or sell \r\n  the cocaine somewhere.Â  Dudley knew that Stokes and Hale were from Virginia \r\n  and would most probably travel through South Carolina while in possession of \r\n  the contraband.\r\nAt common law, criminal jurisdiction was \r\n  based primarily on the territorial principle.Â  Courts have created the doctrine \r\n  of constructive presence in order to allow a state to punish an offender not \r\n  located within the state when the offender set in motion the events which culminated \r\n  in a harm in the prosecuting state.Â  The doctrine is articulated in Simpson \r\n  v. State, 17 S.E. 984 (Ga. 1893).Â  In Simpson, the defendant, who \r\n  had been standing in South Carolina at the time he shot at a person in Georgia, \r\n  was convicted in Georgia.Â  Simpson applied the doctrine of constructive \r\n  presence by concluding that the act of the accused took effect in Georgia.\r\nThe exercise of legislative criminal jurisdiction \r\n  is recognized by reference to statutory language identifying the proscribed \r\n  conduct.Â  This state in the statutory verbiage encapsulates an objective territorial \r\n  effect and proscribes conduct that occurs outside of the stateâ€™s physical borders.\r\nHere, Dudley demonstrated specific intent \r\n  to act and the intent that the harm occur in South Carolina.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Circuit Court had personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  and extraterritorial jurisdiction over Dudley.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM \r\n  the conviction and sentence of Dudley for trafficking in cocaine.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  (concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part):Â  I agree with the analysis and conclusions reached by both the \r\n  majority opinion and Judge Andersonâ€™s dissent on the issues of basic subject \r\n  matter and personal jurisdiction.Â  However, because I am not convinced that \r\n  extraterritorial jurisdiction is equivalent to subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  I respectfully dissent.Â  \r\nThe fundamental issue is whether the defense that \r\n  the State exceeded its territorial jurisdiction should have been raised to and \r\n  ruled on by the trial court.Â  Because it clearly was not, the only way this \r\n  court can address it is to equate it to subject matter jurisdiction.Â  This is \r\n  a novel issue in South Carolina, and a review of the sparse case law from our \r\n  state and the leading cases from other states convinces me it is not subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  Therefore, I believe this issue is not preserved and should \r\n  not be addressed for the first time on appeal.Â  See State v. Hicks, \r\n  330 S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (issue must be raised to and ruled \r\n  on by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); Hendrix v. Eastern \r\n  Dist., 320 S.C. 218, ___,Â  464 S.E.2d 112, ___ (1995) (unpreserved issue \r\n  should not be addressed on appeal).Â  \r\nThe limited number of cases from our supreme court \r\n  shed no light on the question of whether extraterritorial or, as it is sometimes \r\n  called â€œterritorial,â€ jurisdiction is equivalent to subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  However, it is instructive to note that in the two leading South Carolina cases \r\n  on the subject, State v. Morrow, 40 S.C. 221, 230, 18 S.E. 853, 856 (1893) \r\n  and State v. Farne, 190 S.C. 75, 82, 1 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1939), no error \r\n  preservation issues were present because objections to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction \r\n  were appropriately made in the trial court, fully argued, and ruled on.Â  Therefore, \r\n  our supreme court did not need to specify whether the issue was subject matter \r\n  or some other type of jurisdiction.Â  It was referred to simply as a question \r\n  of â€œjurisdiction.â€\r\nThe same holds true for the cases from other jurisdictions \r\n  cited in the majority opinion.Â  In Re Vasquez, 705 N.E.2d 606 (Mass. \r\n  1999), is a case heavily relied on by the majority for the proposition that \r\n  the issue involved is not personal jurisdiction.Â  I do not agree, however, with \r\n  the inference drawn therefrom that because it is not personal jurisdiction, \r\n  it must be subject matter jurisdiction.Â  There is no such holding in Vasquez.Â  \r\n  Indeed, the court specifically stated it was addressing solely the question \r\n  of whether Vasquezâ€™ arrest pursuant to the Massachusetts Governorâ€™s Warrant \r\n  was appropriate under the laws of Massachusetts.Â  The court noted Vasquezâ€™ argument, \r\n  which the court viewed as a claim the State of Oregon had no legislative jurisdiction \r\n  to criminalize acts occurring outside Oregonâ€™s boundaries, could be made in \r\n  the Oregon courts, and if he is dissatisfied with the determination made by \r\n  the Oregon courts â€œand if he has properly preserved it there, he may \r\n  petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 610 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nVirtually all, if not all, of the other cases ruling \r\n  on the subject of territorial jurisdiction did so after a hearing on the issue \r\n  or a trial on the merits, and the ultimate conclusion turns on the evidence, \r\n  or lack thereof, of the defendantâ€™s intent that the act have a detrimental effect \r\n  in the state conducting the prosecution.Â  The conclusion reached by the majority \r\n  that South Carolina cannot exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over Dudley \r\n  hinges on its finding that there is no evidence Dudley intended for her act \r\n  to create a detrimental effect within South Carolina.Â  This is the identical \r\n  result reached by a divided court in Michigan in People v. Blume, 505 \r\n  N.W.2d 843 (Mich. 1993).Â  The difference in this case and the Blume case, \r\n  however, is that lack of territorial jurisdiction was raised to and ruled on \r\n  by the trial court in the Blume case and was a proper subject for appeal.Â  \r\n  505 N.W.2d at 845, 849 n.19.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is generally determined \r\n  as a matter of law, requiring little if any evidence, particularly evidence \r\n  of the intent of the accused.Â  I frankly do not know whether extraterritorial \r\n  jurisdiction is a part of personal jurisdiction, or is a third kind of jurisdiction \r\n  not yet clearly articulated as such by the courts of South Carolina.Â  I am nevertheless \r\n  convinced it is an issue that must be raised to and ruled on by the trial court, \r\n  as well as properly briefed to this court to warrant our addressing it.Â  Because \r\n  Dudley did neither, I would affirm her conviction.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  The indictment for trafficking in cocaine provided:\r\n  \r\n  That Dana Dudley, AKA Dana \r\n    Wilson did in Anderson County, South Carolina on or about September 10, 1997 \r\n    traffic in cocaine by aiding and abetting the bringing into this State of \r\n    South Carolina 200 or more grams of cocaine.\r\n  \r\n  The indictment charging Dudley with conspiracy to \r\n    traffic cocaine stated:\r\n  \r\n  That Dana Dudley, AKA Dana \r\n    Wilson did in Anderson County, South Carolina on or about September 10, 1997 \r\n    to September 15, 1997 conspire with another to knowingly traffic in excess \r\n    of 200 grams of cocaine. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Other than a reference in her closing argument, Dudley never raised \r\n    any jurisdictional challenge to the circuit court.Â  On appeal, Dudley only \r\n    challenged the lack of subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the charge \r\n    of trafficking in cocaine.Â  In contrast, the State argued there was no jurisdictional \r\n    issue before this Court.Â  The State characterized Dudleyâ€™s appeal as a question \r\n    of personal jurisdiction, which Dudley waived by failing to raise this issue \r\n    at trial.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  We note the General Assembly has defined at least two limited situations \r\n    extending the reach of South Carolinaâ€™s criminal statutes.Â  See S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 17-21-30 (2003) (â€œWhen any person within the limits of this State \r\n    shall inflict an injury on any person who at the time the injury is inflicted \r\n    is beyond the limits of this State or when any person beyond the limits of \r\n    this State shall inflict an injury on any person at the time within the limits \r\n    of this State and such injury shall cause the death of the person injured, \r\n    in either case the person causing such death shall be subject to be indicted, \r\n    tried and punished in the first case in the county of this State where the \r\n    person inflicting the injury was at the time when the injury was inflicted \r\n    and, in the second case, in the county in which it was received.â€); S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 17-21-50 (2003) (â€œA person charged as an accessory before the fact \r\n    may be indicted, tried and punished in the same court and county in which \r\n    the principal felon might be indicted and tried, although the offense of counseling, \r\n    hiring or procuring the commission of such felony is committed on the high \r\n    seas or on land outside of the county either within or without the limits \r\n    of this State.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â  Despite testimony that Morrow had acted and formulated his intent \r\n    within South Carolina, which the Court believed was sufficient to establish \r\n    jurisdiction in this State, the Court went on to consider Morrowâ€™s specific \r\n    issue by assuming there were no overt acts in South Carolina.Â  Thus, to the \r\n    extent the Courtâ€™s analysis could be construed as dicta, we reference Morrow \r\n    for the sole purpose of establishing that our Supreme Court has recognized \r\n    and applied the â€œeffects doctrine.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [5]    We recognize the record contains transcriptions of telephone conversations \r\n    that Stokes made to Dudley from South Carolina.Â  These conversations, however, \r\n    did not culminate in the criminal conduct for which Dudley was indicted.Â  \r\n    The conversations took place after the September 10th drug transaction in \r\n    Atlanta.Â  Furthermore, the controlled buy that was set up from these conversations \r\n    was unsuccessful and, more importantly, was attempted just outside of Atlanta.Â  \r\n    Thus, there is no evidence in the record that would support the exercise of \r\n    jurisdiction in South Carolina. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Â Â We note the dissent finds the evidence sufficient to support extraterritorial \r\n    jurisdiction for the offense of trafficking in cocaine, but not conspiracy \r\n    to traffic cocaine.Â  Regarding the trafficking offense, the dissent reasons \r\n    â€œDudley demonstrated specific intent to act and the intent that the harm occur \r\n    in South Carolina.â€Â  It is difficult to reconcile the contradictory result \r\n    reached by the dissent given both offenses under section 44-53-370(e)(2)(d) \r\n    require a specific intent to bring cocaine â€œinto this State.â€Â  S.C.

Andrew Gowder, Jr., of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJoseph W. Ginn, III, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island appeals \r\n  the order of the master-in-equity granting a prescriptive easement across church \r\n  property to the residents of Evans Road.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Appellant, John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island \r\n  (church), is an old parish church located adjacent to the west side of River \r\n  Road on Johns Island, South Carolina.Â  In 1874, the church acquired a one-acre \r\n  parcel surrounding the sanctuary from Isaac P. Grimball.Â  In 1943, Grimballâ€™s \r\n  widow sold forty-two acres juxtaposed to the east side of River Road directly \r\n  across from the church to Hawthorne Flying Service (currently Johns Island Airport), \r\n  and in the same transaction, Hawthorne acquired a triangular 6.8-acre parcel \r\n  that bounded the church on three sides.Â  In 1980, Hawthorne sold the 6.8-acre \r\n  parcel to the church.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Respondents (residents) are title owners of various parcels of property \r\n  also located west of River Road on Johns Island.Â  All of their properties border \r\n  Evans Road, a long established road, which bounds the remaining fourth side \r\n  of the church property.Â  The residents gain sole access to their respective \r\n  homes and properties from River Road by way of a section of Evans Road, which \r\n  runs across the 6.8-acre parcel belonging to the church.Â  It is this part of \r\n  Evans Road that is in controversy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSome of the residents and their predecessors in title have continuously used \r\n  Evans Road for roughly sixty years.Â  In fact, Evans Road was named after a predecessor \r\n  in title and family member of one or more of the current residents.Â  The entire \r\n  length of the road, including the segment crossing church lands, has been maintained \r\n  by Charleston County for around twenty-five years.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nApproximately two and a half years before the trial, the church planned to \r\n  construct another building on its property in a location that would cut off \r\n  the residentsâ€™ access to Evans Road.Â  Shortly before the residents brought \r\n  this action, the church, without communicating with any resident, attempted \r\n  to create another route from the residentsâ€™ properties to River Road.Â  The alternate \r\n  route consists of a scraped dirt path that leads from the existing Evans Road \r\n  where it first joins the residentsâ€™ properties, continues southward across the \r\n  church property, and then merges with an existing driveway that ultimately joins \r\n  River Road.Â  This â€œnewâ€ access is about 142 feet south of where the existing \r\n  Evans Road meets River Road. Â Upon discovering the churchâ€™s activities, \r\n  the residents immediately communicated in writing to the church that they objected \r\n  to any attempts to block their existing access, inquired as to the churchâ€™s \r\n  intentions, and asserted their right to continued use of Evans Road.Â  The church \r\n  did not reply.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nConsequently, the residents brought an action in the circuit court seeking \r\n  a temporary restraining order enjoining the church from closing off access to \r\n  Evans Road and a declaratory judgment granting a prescriptive easement over \r\n  Evans Road.Â  The parties stipulated to a temporary injunction until the matter \r\n  could be adjudicated with finality by the master-in-equity for Charleston County.Â  \r\n  The master granted the residents a prescriptive easement under claim of right \r\n  over Evans Road. \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the master err in granting a prescriptive easement based upon the residentsâ€™ \r\n  use under claim of right?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the existence of an easement is an action at \r\n  law.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998); \r\n  Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998). Establishing the existence of an easement is a question of \r\n  fact in a law action.Â  Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551, 357 S.E.2d \r\n  710, 711 (1987); Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 526, 492 S.E.2d 420, \r\n  423 (Ct. App. 1997); Revis v. Barrett, 321 S.C. 206, 208, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  460, 462 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The present matter was consensually referred to the \r\n  master-in-equity for entry of final judgment.Â  Accordingly, our scope of review \r\n  is limited to correction of errors of law, and we will not disturb the masterâ€™s \r\n  factual findings that have some evidentiary support.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. \r\n  v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe church contends \r\n  the master erred in concluding the residents established a prescriptive easement \r\n  because the evidence does not support a factual finding that the residentsâ€™ \r\n  use was under claim of right.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 527, 492 S.E.2d 420, 423 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997), this court affirmed the standard for proving a prescriptive \r\n  easement, relying upon previous standards set out in Horry County v. Laychur, \r\n  315 S.C. 264, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993) and Revis v. Barrett, 321 S.C. 206, \r\n  467 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  There is a distinction between these two cases \r\n  regarding the first of the three components required to meet the standard.\r\nRevis recited the entire standard, including the first factor, exactly \r\n  as it appears in Morrow.Â  â€œTo establish a private right of way by prescription, \r\n  one must show (1) continued use for 20 years; . . . .â€Â  Revis, 321 S.C. \r\n  at 209, 467 S.E.2d at 462.Â  Revis cites both Laychur and Babb \r\n  v. Harrison, 220 S.C. 20, 66 S.E.2d 457 (1951) in support of the language \r\n  used in its version of the standard.Â  However in both Laychur and Babb, \r\n  the first element of the standard consists of not only continued but also â€œuninterruptedâ€ \r\n  use for twenty years.Â  â€œThe following prerequisites must be met to establish \r\n  a right by prescription: (1) There must be continued and uninterrupted use \r\n  or enjoyment of the right for a period of 20 years.â€Â  Laychur, 315 \r\n  S.C. at 367, 434 S.E.2d at 261 (emphasis added).Â  â€œ[T]he requirements necessary \r\n  to establishing a right by prescription are: (1) the continued and uninterrupted \r\n  use or enjoyment of the right for the full period of twenty years . . . \r\n  .â€Â  Babb v. Harrison, 220 S.C. 20, 24-25, 66 S.E.2d 457, 458 (1951) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The remaining two elements in both Laychur and Babb are \r\n  consistent with those found in the standard set out in Morrow.\r\nBabb and a long litany of South Carolina cases dating back to Lawton \r\n  v. Rivers, 13 S.C.L. (2 McCord) 445, 449 (1823) call for both continuous \r\n  and uninterrupted use to satisfy a grant of a prescriptive easement.Â  Sanitary \r\n  &amp; Aseptic Package Co. v. Shealy, 205 S.C. 198, 203, 31 S.E.2d 253, 255 \r\n  (1944); Poole v. Edwards, 197 S.C. 280, 283, 15 S.E.2d 349, 350 (1941); \r\n  Williamson v. Abbot, 107 S.C. 397, 400, 93 S.E. 15, 15-16 (1917).Â  It \r\n  remains unclear why Revis and later Morrow deleted the â€œuninterrupted \r\n  use or enjoymentâ€ language from part one of the standard.Â  In the instant case, \r\n  we use the standard set out in Babb as the most current, correct, and \r\n  complete version of the essentials necessary to prove an easement by prescription.\r\nIt has long been recognized that the requisites necessary to establish \r\n  a right by prescription are:Â  (1) the continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment \r\n  of the right for the full period of twenty years, (2) the identity of the thing \r\n  enjoyed, and (3) the use or enjoyment was adverse or under claim of right.Â  \r\n  Babb, 220 S.C. at 24-25, 66 S.E.2d at 458; Sanitary &amp; Aseptic \r\n  Package Co., 205 S.C. at 203, 31 S.E2d at 255; Poole, 197 S.C. at \r\n  283, 15 S.E.2d at 349; Williamson, 107 S.C. at 400, 93 S.E. at 15-16; \r\n  Lawton, 13 S.C.L. (2 McCord) at 449.\r\nIt is uncontested that the residents and/or their predecessors in title have \r\n  enjoyed continued and uninterrupted use of the clearly marked and well-known \r\n  Evans Road in excess of twenty years.Â  Thus, we devote our analysis to the remaining \r\n  third factor of the prescriptive easement standard.Â  \r\nThe church challenges the masterâ€™s findings, arguing the residentsâ€™ \r\n  belief that they have a right to use Evans Road â€œis based solely on the fact \r\n  that they are accustomed to using it and prefer it.â€Â  The church further suggests \r\n  that all of the residentsâ€™ testimonies regarding their claim of right may be \r\n  summarized into the single declaration that â€œthe [residents] had always used \r\n  [Evans Road]â€ and this claim of perpetual use is also â€œthe sole basis of [the \r\n  residentsâ€™] claim of right.â€Â  Finally, the church interprets our courtâ€™s holdings \r\n  in Revis and Morrow to support its position that the residents \r\n  have not met the burden of proving a prescriptive easement under claim of right.Â  \r\n  The church cites Revis and Morrow for the proposition that a party \r\n  cannot assert a claim of right solely on the ground that it thought it had the \r\n  right.Â Â   \r\nIn support of the theory that the residentsâ€™ claim of right \r\n  is based on perpetual and preferred use alone, the church presented testimony \r\n  that neither it nor Hawthorne Flying Service ever told the residents that their \r\n  use was by right or would be permanent.\r\nHowever, at least one of the residents stated that when he purchased his property \r\n  on Evans Road, both the seller and the next-door neighbor to the property told \r\n  him that Evans Road could not ever be legally closed off â€œ[a]nd [access to Evans \r\n  Road] was part of the consideration for [his] purchase of the property.â€Â  A \r\n  long-time parishioner and lay leader of the church, who claimed active attendance \r\n  since childhood, attested that at the time the church bought the property in \r\n  which the disputed portion of the road runs, the church was aware that Evans \r\n  Road was on the property and had been in use for forty years.Â  Moreover, the \r\n  witness admitted the church had built the rectory on a site across the road \r\n  from the church to avoid blocking Evans Road in 1986.Â  Regardless of whether \r\n  or not the church verbally assured the residents of a permanent right to use \r\n  the road, its selection of a building site for the rectory in 1986 indicated \r\n  its willingness to preserve access to Evans Road.Â  \r\nCuriously, the church also presents the residentsâ€™ testimonies that they did \r\n  not believe they owned the path and had no intention of owning \r\n  it to the exclusion of the church as proof the claim of right rested on their \r\n  use alone.\r\nThe residents do not argue that any one of them individually or collectively \r\n  holds actual title to the road, nor do the residents bring an action to settle \r\n  title in themselves.Â  The law granting a prescriptive easement under claim of \r\n  right does not mandate a party to believe that he holds actual title or that \r\n  he intends to acquire it.Â  Rather, our courts have held in order for a party \r\n  to earn a prescriptive easement under claim of right he must demonstrate a substantial \r\n  belief that he had the right to use the parcel or road based upon the \r\n  totality of circumstances surrounding his use.Â  See Revis v. Barrett, \r\n  321 S.C. 206, 209, 467 S.E.2d 460, 462 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding a partyâ€™s belief \r\n  about her right to use a road flowed from a claim of right where she knew use \r\n  of the road had originated with her parents, the road was formerly a state road, \r\n  she knew and participated in a lawsuit against a party seeking to deny her use, \r\n  and she had used the road for a substantial period of time); see also \r\n  Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 528, 492 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1997) \r\n  (noting a partyâ€™s belief that he had a right-of-way may be sufficient for a \r\n  prescriptive easement pursuant to a claim of right).Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe church maintains that the residents have â€œattempt[ed] to cobble together \r\n  a â€˜claim of right,â€™â€ while conceding in its brief that â€œthey used the road for \r\n  a long time, that their parents or other relatives had used the road, that the \r\n  County had occasionally scraped [Evans Road].â€ Â The church does not address \r\n  these arguments directly.Â  Instead the church dismisses them by insisting that \r\n  a claim of right, by definition, requires the claiming party have â€œsome legal \r\n  right to use the roadâ€ and â€œ[Evans Road] is simply the residentsâ€™ preferred \r\n  way to get to River Road.â€Â  The church does not give these attendant facts sufficient \r\n  importance and misinterprets their significance in supporting a claim of right.Â  \r\n\r\nMany of the residents testified they have used Evans Road since childhood and \r\n  claimed their right flowed from their own continuous use of the road and use \r\n  by prior generations of their families.Â  Resident Jacquelyn T. Parham declared \r\n  that she has used Evans Road as the sole access to her family home since she \r\n  was a little girl.Â  Indeed, Evans Road was named for Parhamâ€™s grandparents.Â  \r\n  Parham opined that she felt the residents had the right to use the road \r\n  â€œbecause [her] grandparents used it.Â  [Evans Road] was there when they purchased \r\n  the property [and] itâ€™s just handed down, a community road.â€Â  Resident Richard \r\n  Hartley professed that he had lived on Evans Road and used Evans Road as sole \r\n  access his whole life of 56.5 years to reach his family home, which was acquired \r\n  by his parents prior to 1945. Â Resident William J. Hartley, Jr. declared \r\n  that he was sixty years old and had lived on Evans Road and used Evans Road \r\n  as sole access to his family home all his life.Â  Hartley was given his property \r\n  by his father.Â  Resident Jennie Mae Lemacks established that she was seventy-three \r\n  years old, lived on Evans Road since she was 13.5 years old (almost sixty years), \r\n  and had used Evans Road as the sole access to her property the entire time.Â  \r\n  Lemacks alleged that her home had been family property since 1942.Â  It is clear \r\n  from the record that the residents and/or their predecessors in title carried \r\n  on a tradition of use for several decades.Â  Further, testimony shows the residents \r\n  relied upon the use by their predecessors in title to gird their belief that \r\n  they held a claim of right to use Evans Road.\r\nIt is acknowledged that Charleston County has maintained Evans Road for many \r\n  years.Â  Resident Parham avowed that the county has brought in dirt and rocks \r\n  to refurbish the roadbed and routinely scraped Evans Road at least once a month \r\n  for about twenty years.Â  Resident Richard Hartley also said that the county \r\n  maintained Evans Road with truckloads of dirt and grading equipment about once \r\n  a month for over twenty-five years.Â  Resident William Hartley testified that \r\n  the county had maintained the road for twenty years or more.Â  The church never \r\n  objected to the countyâ€™s care and upkeep of the road.Â  Our supreme court has \r\n  held that such an extended duration of public maintenance fortifies the public \r\n  character of a road and supports a finding that those who use the road may acquire \r\n  an easement.Â  See Darlington County v. Perkins, 269 S.C. 572, \r\n  575, 239 S.E.2d 69, 70-71 (1977) (â€œWe are of the view, however, that \r\n  the continuous and widespread public usage of the road for at least 50 years, \r\n  without charge or interference from previous owners and these Landowners, clearly \r\n  establishes the public character of the road.Â  This conclusion is fortified \r\n  by the extent and duration of the maintenance which the county has performed \r\n  on the road.â€).\r\nÂ The master relied upon this courtâ€™s decision in Revis v. Barrett, 321 \r\n  S.C. 206, 467 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In Revis, similar to the facts \r\n  in this case, the party seeking an easement had been using the road at issue \r\n  to access her property and she was aware that her parents had used this roadway \r\n  to access this property.Â  In Revis, this court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  grant of a prescriptive easement under claim of right holding:\r\n\r\nClearly, Revis was under the impression that she had a continuing \r\n  right to use the road, originating with her parentsâ€™ use of the roadway.Â  There \r\n  was certainly ample evidence to support the masterâ€™s finding Revisâ€™ belief about \r\n  her right to use the road flowed from a â€œclaim of right,â€ . . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 210, 467 S.E.2d at 462.\r\nIn this case the residents, their families, and/or their predecessors in title \r\n  had used Evans Road for approximately sixty years because they thought they \r\n  had the right to use it.Â  The Charleston County government has extensively maintained \r\n  the road for a period in excess of twenty years.Â  The residents immediately \r\n  reasserted their claim of right on the first occasion that the church attempted \r\n  to interfere with their use.\r\nThere was ample evidence from which the master could have concluded \r\n  that the residents earned a prescriptive easement under claim of right over \r\n  Evans Road.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, \r\n  the order of the master granting a prescriptive easement under claim of right \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  [1] \r\n CONNOR and HUFF,\r\nJJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because we affirm the trial court, it is not necessary to address \r\n    the residentsâ€™ adverse possession claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3643","title":"Eaddy v.

We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEaddy began working at Smurfit-Stone in the mid-1960s.Â  \r\n  He primarily worked as a general mechanic, which involved strenuous physical \r\n  labor at times.Â  Prior to joining Smurfit-Stone, Eaddy spent one year as a student \r\n  at Clemson University followed by one year of service in the Air Force and one \r\n  year as a bank teller.Â  \r\nEaddy testified that while working a 7:00 p.m. \r\n  to 7:00 a.m. shift at Smurfit-Stone on July 19 to 20, 1999, he was working on \r\n  a wood chipper when he felt sharp pains. Â He stated the incident occurred \r\n  about 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning while he was using a twenty-five to thirty \r\n  pound impact wrench, helping to change out the segment on the chipper.Â  Eaddy \r\n  initially attributed the pain to gas and told his co-worker he was going to \r\n  First Aid.Â  There, a nurse gave Eaddy Alka-Seltzers, which Eaddy took.Â  He sat \r\n  down for awhile, but subsequently returned to work.Â  Through the course of his \r\n  shift, Eaddyâ€™s pain worsened and he complained to another co-worker.Â  Around \r\n  7:00 a.m., Eaddy reported to his maintenance foreman that he was in pain stating, \r\n  â€œI believe my guts is coming out.â€Â  His supervisor told him to report to the \r\n  First Aid office again and fill out a report.Â  After doing so, Eaddy \r\n  returned to his home.Â  \r\nOnce Eaddy arrived home, he took some old pain \r\n  medication and slept until the following morning.Â  When he awoke he was still \r\n  experiencing pain, so he contacted the nurse at Smufit-Stone, who thereafter \r\n  instructed him to go to the emergency room at Carolinas Hospital System in Florence.Â  \r\n  At the hospital, Eaddy complained of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, \r\n  and vomiting.Â  Dr. David Anderson saw Eaddy on July 21, 1999, and determined \r\n  Eaddy had a bowel obstruction secondary to a recurrent ventral hernia.Â  \r\nDuring the course of his employment at Smurfit-Stone \r\n  and prior to the present incident, Eaddy underwent four hernia operations, all \r\n  performed by Dr. Reginald S. Bolick.Â  The first operation occurred on October \r\n  26, 1987, to treat an umbilical hernia.Â  Surgery for a second umbilical hernia \r\n  took place on November 21, 1988.Â  Dr. Bolick saw Eaddy again in December 1992 \r\n  for treatment of a ventral hernia in a different location that was in his midline \r\n  section above his umbilicus.Â  He performed surgery on Eaddy on January 4, 1993 \r\n  to repair this hernia, and operated on him again on January 12, 1993 when he \r\n  developed a recurrence of this hernia after an episode of severe post-operative \r\n  coughing.Â  \r\nDr. Bolick testified, although he referred to Eaddyâ€™s \r\n  third hernia as a â€œrecurrent herniaâ€ in his December 1992 notes, he considered \r\n  this a misnomer, noting that this hernia was actually above the location of \r\n  the previous umbilical hernia repair.Â  Additionally, Dr. Bolick testified that \r\n  there is some degree of inherent weakness of the tissue after one has a hernia, \r\n  and given Eaddyâ€™s susceptibility to hernias, the natural progression of his \r\n  condition would be to develop another one.Â  However, he did not consider Eaddy \r\n  disabled and Eaddy had no permanent impairment at that time.Â  Dr. Bolick further \r\n  stated, when he last saw Eaddy in May 1993, his repair was sound, and he discharged \r\n  Eaddy from his office, releasing him to full activity.Â  Eaddy received treatment, \r\n  as well as temporary total workersâ€™ compensation benefits, for each of these \r\n  hernias.Â  \r\nDr. Anderson testified that he documented in his \r\n  initial consultation on July 21, 1999 that Eaddy reported he was working at \r\n  Smurfit-Stone the day before when â€œhe went to lift something, he felt a pull \r\n  in his abdomen and afterwards felt abdominal pain.â€Â  On July 22, 1999, Dr. Anderson \r\n  operated on Eaddy to repair the ventral hernia and resect a portion of incarcerated \r\n  bowel.Â  When discussing his initial assessment of Eaddyâ€™s condition as a â€œrecurrent \r\n  ventral hernia,â€ Dr. Anderson stated, â€œWell, it means that heâ€™s had more than \r\n  one and that it has returnedâ€ and because it was his fifth repair, it was a \r\n  recurrent hernia.Â  However, he further testified that the repairs were not always \r\n  in the same location.Â  \r\nAccording to Dr. Anderson, he could not state how \r\n  long the hernia had existed prior to the surgery, but â€œthe intestines had been \r\n  out in the hernia sac for at least twenty-four hoursâ€ at the time of surgery, \r\n  and his intestines most likely became incarcerated and trapped when Eaddy lifted \r\n  the object at work, leading to the onset of pain.Â  Concerning the impact of \r\n  Eaddyâ€™s job on his health, Dr. Anderson testified that it had been â€œa big problem, \r\n  in that . . . he does a tremendous amount of physical work and in doing that, \r\n  heâ€™s putting a tremendous amount of stress on the incisions and that this, in \r\n  part, has led to why heâ€™s had to have so many hernia repairs.â€Â  He further opined \r\n  that if Eaddy continued to go about his work activities, â€œheâ€™s going to develop \r\n  a recurrent hernia, and each time that we do this itâ€™s almost like playing Russian \r\n  Roulette.â€Â  He testified Eaddy could, at most, do â€œsedentary type work,â€ but \r\n  that any kind of physical work at all, including a â€œsimple task in the yard,â€ \r\n  would mean Eaddy was â€œtaking his health into severe risks.â€Â  \r\nEaddyâ€™s co-worker, Russell Suggs, confirmed that \r\n  Eaddy complained to him that he was sick and needed to go to First Aid on the \r\n  night in question.Â  He stated Eaddy was â€œfeeling his stomachâ€ and that â€œit seemed \r\n  like thatâ€™s where he was hurting.â€Â  Eaddyâ€™s maintenance superintendent, Jimmy \r\n  Burroughs, testified that on the date of Eaddyâ€™s alleged accident, Eaddy came \r\n  to the office and told him and the foreman â€œthat he had pulled something loose \r\n  or pulled the hernia loose again.â€Â  \r\nEaddy testified that from 1993, when he had his \r\n  fourth hernia surgery, up until July 20, 1999, he had not felt any tearing feelings \r\n  nor had any trouble with pain in his abdomen.Â  His co-worker Harold Clay verified \r\n  that from 1993 to 1999, Eaddy never complained to him about having any problems \r\n  with his stomach.Â  \r\nAlthough Eaddy agreed that he had not made any \r\n  attempts to return to employment, he testified he did not know of any kind of \r\n  work for which he was qualified that he was capable of performing.Â  Eaddy was \r\n  fifty-eight years old at the time of the hearing before the single commissioner \r\n  in May 2000.Â  \r\nIn October 1999, Eaddy sought permanent disability \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation benefits for his hernia.Â  Smurfit-Stone denied his claim.Â  \r\n  In an August 2000 order, the single commissioner found (1) Eaddy sustained an \r\n  injury resulting in a hernia or rupture on July 20, 1999; (2) the hernia or \r\n  rupture appeared suddenly; (3) the hernia or rupture was accompanied by pain; \r\n  (4) the hernia or rupture immediately followed an accident; (5) the hernia or \r\n  rupture did not exist prior to the accident for which compensation is claimed; \r\n  (6) Eaddy sustained an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment \r\n  at Smurfit-Stone; (7) Eaddy is entitled to all medical, surgical, hospital, \r\n  and other required treatments for the hernia; (8) Eaddy is totally and permanently \r\n  disabled, and entitled to a permanent award of workersâ€™ compensation; and (9) \r\n  because of Eaddyâ€™s total and permanent disability, he is entitled to have all \r\n  resulting and necessary nursing services, medicines, prosthetic devices, sick \r\n  travel, medical, hospital and other treatment or care be paid during Eaddyâ€™s \r\n  life, without any regard to any limitation in the Act, including the maximum \r\n  compensation limit.Â  \r\nSmurfit-Stone appealed to the full commission, \r\n  which affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s findings.Â  It then appealed to the \r\n  circuit court, which affirmed the full commission.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court err in finding Eaddy sustained \r\n  a compensable injury?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court err in finding Eaddy was \r\n  totally and permanently disabled?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court err in failing to find Smurfit-Stone \r\n  was entitled to a credit for accident and sickness benefits, as well as previous \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation payments?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the circuit court err in affirming the full \r\n  commissionâ€™s order because the order was made in violation of the South Carolina \r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA)?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe APA establishes the standard of review for \r\n  decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. \r\n  Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Adkins v. \r\n  Georgia-Pacific Corp., 350 S.C. 34, 36-37, 564 S.E.2d 339, 340 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  An appellate court may reverse or modify a decision if the findings \r\n  or conclusions of the commission are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2002); Adams v. Texfi Indus., 341 S.C. 401, 404, \r\n  535 S.E.2d 124, 125 (2000).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence that, considering \r\n  the entire record, allows reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion reached \r\n  by the full commission.Â  Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, \r\n  441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Compensable Injury\r\nSmurfit-Stone first argues the circuit court erred in affirming \r\n  the full commissionâ€™s finding that Eaddy sustained a compensable hernia injury.Â  \r\n  It contends Eaddy failed to prove the necessary statutory elements under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-40, and further failed to prove an injury by accident arising \r\n  out of and in the course of his employment pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§42-1-160.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn order to be entitled to compensation for an injury under \r\n  the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, a claimant must show he suffered \r\n  an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2002). Â The term â€œarising out ofâ€ \r\n  refers to the origin of the cause of the accident.Â  Dukes v. Rural Metro \r\n  Corp., 346 S.C. 369, 373, 552 S.E.2d 39, 41 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An accidental \r\n  injury is considered to arise out of oneâ€™s employment when there is a causal \r\n  connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed \r\n  and the resulting injury.Â  Id.Â  An injury occurs within the course of \r\n  employment when it occurs within the period of employment, at a place where \r\n  the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties, and while fulfilling \r\n  those duties or engaged in something incidental thereto.Â  Broughton v. South \r\n  of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 498, 520 S.E.2d 634, 639 (Ct.App.1999).Â  There \r\n  is substantial evidence from both Eaddy and Dr. Anderson that Eaddy sustained \r\n  the hernia injury as a result of his working on a piece of equipment during \r\n  the course of his employment.\r\nAdditionally, a person seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits \r\n  for a hernia or rupture must prove to the Commissionâ€™s satisfaction:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That there was an injury resulting in hernia or \r\n  rupture;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the hernia or rupture appeared suddenly;\r\n(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it was accompanied by pain;\r\n(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the hernia or rupture immediately followed \r\n  an accident; and\r\n  (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the hernia or rupture did not exist prior to \r\n  the accident for which compensation is claimed.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-40 (1985).Â  \r\nHere, Dr. Andersonâ€™s testimony indicates that Eaddy suffered \r\n  an injury resulting in a hernia.Â  Additionally, Eaddy testified that he was \r\n  working with a twenty-five to thirty pound instrument when he felt a sharp pain.Â  \r\n  His co-worker verified that Eaddy complained at the time, and indicated he was \r\n  going to First Aid.Â  Other employees confirmed, that as the shift advanced, \r\n  Eaddy continued to complain until he ultimately told one of his superiors that \r\n  he had â€œpulled the hernia loose again.â€Â  Further, Dr. Anderson documented that \r\n  Eaddy told him he was injured when he lifted something at work and that he felt \r\n  a pull in his abdomen and subsequent pain.Â  Thus, there is substantial evidence \r\n  of record that Eaddy suffered an injury resulting in a hernia, the hernia appeared \r\n  suddenly, it was accompanied by pain, and it immediately followed an accident \r\n  when Eaddy attempted to lift a heavy piece of machinery at work.\r\nSmurfit-Stone contends that the evidence does not substantially \r\n  support a finding that Eaddy satisfied the final element of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  42-1-160, which requires that the hernia did not exist prior to the accident \r\n  for which compensation is claimed.Â  In support of its position, Smurfit-Stone \r\n  relies on Eaddyâ€™s four previous hernia operations and the characterization of \r\n  Eaddyâ€™s condition as a â€œrecurring hernia.â€Â  We find this argument unavailing.Â  \r\n\r\nTestimony from Dr. Bolick indicates, although he used the \r\n  term â€œrecurring herniaâ€ in his report, it was really a misnomer.Â  He noted that \r\n  his repair to Eaddyâ€™s last hernia, prior to the 1999 occurrence, was sound, \r\n  and he discharged Eaddy, releasing him to full activity.Â  Further, Dr. Anderson \r\n  indicated when he referred to Eaddyâ€™s hernia as recurrent, he simply meant that \r\n  Eaddy had previous hernias, but noted that the repairs of Eaddyâ€™s hernias were \r\n  not always in the same location.Â  Finally, Eaddy testified that from 1993, when \r\n  he had his fourth hernia surgery, until July 20, 1999, he had not had any tearing \r\n  feelings or any trouble with pain in his abdomen.Â  Thus, we find there is substantial \r\n  evidence of record that Eaddyâ€™s hernia did not exist prior to the accident for \r\n  which compensation is claimed.Â  \r\nBased on our review of the record, we find substantial evidence \r\n  supporting the Commissionâ€™s finding that Eaddy suffered a compensable hernia \r\n  injury.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Total and Permanent Disability\r\nSmurfit-Stone next argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  affirming the full commissionâ€™s finding that Eaddy is totally and permanently \r\n  disabled.Â  We disagree.\r\nTotal disability does not require complete helplessness; \r\n  rather the inability to perform common labor is considered total disability \r\n  for one who is not qualified by training or experience for any other employment.Â  \r\n  Wynn v. Peoples Natural Gas Co. of S.C., 238 S.C. 1, 11, 118 S.E.2d 812, \r\n  817 (1961).Â  On the other hand, if an employee is capable of performing other \r\n  work that is continuously available to him, he will not be deemed totally disabled \r\n  simply because he is unable to resume the duties of the particular occupation \r\n  in which he is engaged at the time of his injury.Â  Id. at 11, 118 S.E.2d \r\n  at 817-18.Â  In order to be entitled to total and permanent disability workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation benefits for a work injury, the claimant must be unable to perform \r\n  services other than those that are so limited in quality, dependability, or \r\n  quantity that a reasonably stable market for them does not exist.Â  Id. \r\n  at 12, 118 S.E.2d at 818; Colvin v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours Co., 227 \r\n  S.C. 465, 474, 88 S.E.2d 581, 585 (1955).Â  See also Stephenson \r\n  v. Rice Servs., Inc., 323 S.C. 113, 118, 473 S.E.2d 699, 702 (1996) (â€œEmployees \r\n  who because of a work-related injury can perform only limited tasks for which \r\n  no reasonably stable market exists are considered totally disabled notwithstanding \r\n  their nominal earning capacity.â€)Â  \r\nHere, both physicians attributed Eaddyâ€™s predisposition \r\n  to hernias to the strenuous physical nature of his work.Â  Each testified that, \r\n  should he continue his work, he would likely sustain future hernias.Â  In particular, \r\n  Dr. Anderson, who performed surgery to treat the hernia upon which the claim \r\n  in the present action is based, testified about the life-threatening nature \r\n  inherent in the pursuit of any physical labor, even light yard work, by Eaddy.Â  \r\n  Dr. Anderson suggested that, at most, Eaddy would be capable of â€œsedentary type \r\n  work.â€Â  Although he served as a bank teller, he worked in that position over \r\n  three decades ago and did so for only one year.Â  Further, the work skills he \r\n  developed over his thirty-five year career with Smurfit-Stone depended heavily \r\n  on strenuous physical labor, which he can no longer safely perform.Â  Given Eaddyâ€™s \r\n  age and the evidence of record that he has no current skills needed to perform \r\n  any sedentary work, we find there is substantial evidence he has no skills for \r\n  which a reasonably stable market exists.Â  Accordingly, we find the record supports \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s finding that Eaddy is totally and permanently disabled.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Credit for Total and Permanent Disability\r\nSmurfit-Stone further contends, assuming Eaddy is totally \r\n  and permanently disabled, the circuit court erred in failing to find it is entitled \r\n  to a credit offsetting its obligation by the amounts of (1) all accident and \r\n  sickness benefits paid to Eaddy related to the present hernia, and (2) all workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation benefits Eaddy received in the past while working for Smurfit-Stone \r\n  for prior workersâ€™ compensation injuries. [1] Â  We disagree.\r\nSmurfit-Stone summarily asserts it is entitled to a credit \r\n  for thirty-three weeks of accident and sickness benefits, which the claimant \r\n  testified he received following the incident.Â  It cites no law in support of \r\n  this assertion, but merely claims an entitlement to the credit.Â  This court \r\n  has noted that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority \r\n  are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  Glasscock, Inc. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d \r\n  689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  See also R &amp; G Constr., Inc. \r\n  v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 S.E.2d 113, 120 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (where no authority is cited and argument in brief is conclusory, \r\n  issue is deemed abandoned); First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, \r\n  363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (appellant was deemed to have abandoned issue \r\n  where he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority).Â  At any rate, \r\n  even if this argument were properly presented to this court, we agree with the \r\n  circuit court that, pursuant to Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, \r\n  297-98, 519 S.E.2d 583, 599-600 (Ct. App. 1999), Smurfit-Stone is not entitled \r\n  to a credit for the payments because there is no evidence of record that the \r\n  accident and sickness benefits were made with reference to liability under the \r\n  provisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nIn like summary fashion, Smurfit-Stone further asserts it \r\n  is entitled to a credit for all benefits Eaddy received from past workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  injuries because he is only entitled to â€œcompensation for the degree of disability \r\n  which would have resulted had he not suffered from prior hernias pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-9-150, 42-9-160, and 42-9-170.â€Â  Assuming arguendo that \r\n  Smurfit-Stone has not abandoned this issue based on its conclusory argument, \r\n  we find no merit to its position.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-150 provides:\r\n\r\nIf an employee has a permanent disability or has \r\n  sustained a permanent injury in service in the Army or Navy of the United \r\n  States or in another employment other than that in which he receives a subsequent \r\n  permanent injury by accident, such as specified in Â§ 42-9-30 or the second \r\n  paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 he shall be entitled to compensation only for the degree \r\n  of disability which would have resulted from the later accident if the earlier \r\n  disability or injury had not existed, except that such employee may receive \r\n  further benefits as provided by Â§Â§ 42-7-310, 42-9-400 and 42-9-410 Title (sic) \r\n  if his subsequent injury qualifies for additional benefits provided therein.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-150 (1985) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  As noted by the circuit court, pursuant to this statute, an employer would only \r\n  be entitled to credit for previous awards of workersâ€™ compensation benefits \r\n  involving permanent disability.Â  There is no evidence of record, however, that \r\n  Eaddy ever sustained a previous permanent injury or received any permanent benefits \r\n  for such an injury.Â  The only evidence of any prior workersâ€™ compensation benefits \r\n  received by Eaddy were temporary total benefits paid by Smurfit-Stone.Â  Neither \r\n  is there evidence that Eaddy sustained a previous injury in service in the Army \r\n  or Navy or in another employment besides that of Smurfit-Stone.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  this statute is inapplicable to the present situation.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-160 provides:\r\n\r\nIf an employee receives an injury for which compensation is \r\n  payable while he is still receiving or entitled to compensation for a previous \r\n  injury in the same employment, he shall not at the same time be entitled \r\n  to compensation for both injuries, unless the later injury be a permanent \r\n  injury such as specified in Â§ 42-9-30 or the second paragraph ofÂ  Â§ 42-9-10, \r\n  but he shall be entitled to compensation for that injury and from the time of \r\n  that injury which will cover the longest period and the largest amount payable \r\n  under this Title.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-160 (1985) (emphasis added).Â  We first \r\n  note this statute is inapplicable as there is no evidence Eaddy was â€œstill receiving \r\n  or entitled to compensationâ€ for his previous hernias.Â  Further, Eaddy would \r\n  fall under the exception of the provision since his latter hernia has been determined \r\n  to be a permanent injury.\r\nFinally, South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-170 provides in \r\n  pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIf an employee receives a permanent injury as specified \r\n  in Â§ 42-9-30 or the second paragraph of Â§ 42-9-10 after having sustained \r\n  another permanent injury in the same employment, he shall be entitled to \r\n  compensation for both injuries, but the total compensation shall be paid by \r\n  extending the period and not by increasing the amount of weekly compensation, \r\n  and in no case exceeding five hundred weeks.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-170 (1985) (emphasis added).Â  Again, \r\n  because Eaddy did not suffer a permanent injury from the previous hernias, this \r\n  statute is immaterial.\r\nAccordingly, we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s refusal \r\n  to find Smurfit-Stone was entitled to any credit for accident and sickness benefits \r\n  [2]  or previous workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Commissionâ€™s Order\r\nSmurfit-Stone next contends that the circuit court \r\n  erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s order, alleging the order violated the South \r\n  Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (Act).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Act provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nA final decision or order adverse to a party in a contested \r\n  case shall be in writing or stated in the record.Â  A final decision shall include \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated.Â  Findings of fact, \r\n  if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit \r\n  statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (1986).Â  Here, Smurfit-Stone contends \r\n  that the Commissionâ€™s order, which generally affirmed the single commissioner, \r\n  lacked separately stated findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  It also contends \r\n  the order lacked an explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s findings, as well as separately stated conclusions of law.Â  We \r\n  find this argument unavailing.\r\nThe Commission incorporated the single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  order by reference as if set forth verbatim within the Commissionâ€™s order.Â  \r\n  The Commissionâ€™s order stated, in part:\r\n\r\n[W]e, the appellate panel have reviewed the Award and weighed \r\n  the evidence as presented at the initial hearing.Â  We have also considered all \r\n  issues raised [in Eaddyâ€™s and Smurfit-Stoneâ€™s briefs].\r\nAfter careful review in the instant case, the appellate panel \r\n  of the [Commission] has determined that all of the Hearing Commissionerâ€™s Findings \r\n  of Fact and Rulings of Law are correct as stated.Â  We find that such Findings \r\n  of Fact and Conclusions of Law are hereby included in this Order \r\n  by reference, and by such reference, \r\n  the requirements of Baldwin v. James River Corporation, 304 SC 485, 405 SE2d4, \r\n  (sic) as well as Sections 42-17-40 and 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code of \r\n  Laws have been met.Â  \r\n\r\nThe opinion also contained a footnote that stated:\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law as contained in the single commissionerâ€™s order are specifically referenced \r\n  and included in toto in the â€œorderâ€ portion of this decision so as to \r\n  comply with the requirements of Baldwin v. James River Corp., 304 SC 485, \r\n  405 SE2d4, [3]  as well as [the APA].Â  In the \r\n  interest of brevity they have not been repeated in the body of this order. \r\n\r\nWe find the Commissionâ€™s incorporation of the single \r\n  commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law by reference provided \r\n  the circuit court with sufficiently definite and detailed findings to allow \r\n  the circuit court to ascertain whether the findings by the Commission were supported \r\n  by the evidence and whether the law was correctly applied.Â  Accordingly we find \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s order complied with the pertinent provisions of the APA.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Although \r\n    it is questionable whether Smurfit-Stone raised this issue to the single commissioner, \r\n    it is clear it was raised before both the full commission and the circuit \r\n    court, and was addressed by the circuit court in its order.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] As \r\n    in Muir, 336 S.C. 266, 298 n.1, 519 S.E.2d 583, 600 n.1, we express \r\n    no position on Smurfit-Stoneâ€™s subrogation rights for the accident and sickness \r\n    benefits. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  It should be noted the correct citation is Baldwin v. James River \r\n    Corp., 304 S.C. 485, 405 S.E.2d 421 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In Baldwin, \r\n    this court determined the findings of fact in the Commissionâ€™s order, reversing \r\n    the single commissionerâ€™s finding of compensability, were conclusory, and \r\n    remanded the case to the Commission to make sufficient findings of fact to \r\n    afford a reasonable basis for appellate review.

Buffington, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nPaul C. Ballou, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  Thomas Trancik, M.D., P.A. \r\n  (â€œTrancikâ€) [1]  brought this \r\n  action for breach of contract and violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act \r\n  (â€œUTPAâ€), alleging USAA Insurance Company (â€œUSAAâ€) failed to honor an assignment \r\n  of settlement proceeds executed by his patient, Rosemary Wiggs, in connection \r\n  with medical treatment she received following a motor-vehicle collision with \r\n  USAAâ€™s insured.Â  The trial court dismissed the suit, ruling Trancik failed to \r\n  state a claim for relief because no contractual privity with USAA existed.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nTrancik performed surgery on Wiggs for injuries she received in \r\n  an automobile accident.Â  Prior to surgery, Wiggs executed an assignment, which \r\n  states in relevant part:\r\n\r\nI Rose Mary Wiggs, hereby guarantee payment of all charges \r\n  incurred . . . and hereby assign any medical insurance . . . or settlement \r\n  proceeds due because of liability of a third party by any party, organization \r\n  or insurance company . . . .\r\n\r\n.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n\r\nIn the event the undersigned is entitled to physician or \r\n  physicians benefits of any type whatsoever arising out of any policy of insurance \r\n  insuring the patient or any party liable to patient, said benefits are hereby \r\n  assigned to Physician for application on patientâ€™s bill, and it is agreed that \r\n  the Physician may receipt for any such payment and such payment shall discharge \r\n  the said insurance company of any and all obligations under the policy to the \r\n  extent of such payment, the undersigned and/or patient being responsible for \r\n  charges not covered by this assignment.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Wiggs sued the at-fault driver, who referred \r\n  the matter to her insurance carrier, USAA.Â  Trancik sent the assignment to USAA, \r\n  and USAA acknowledged receipt of it.Â  USAA then settled Wiggsâ€™ claim, sending \r\n  payment directly to her.Â  Wiggs did not pay Trancik.&nbsp; \r\nTrancik brought this suit against USAA, \r\n  claiming the payment of settlement proceeds directly to Wiggs breached the assignment \r\n  contract and violated the UTPA.Â  The trial court dismissed both causes of action.Â  \r\n  Trancik appeals the dismissal of his breach of contract claim, arguing the trial \r\n  court improperly concluded he lacked contractual privity with USAA.Â  We affirm.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court must dismiss a claim pursuant to \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, if the pleadings, \r\n  when taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, fail to allege sufficient \r\n  facts to constitute a cause of action. See Woodell ex rel. Allen v. \r\n  Marion Sch. Dist. One, 307 S.C. 297, 298, 414 S.E.2d 794, 794 (Ct. App. \r\n  1992).Â  However, the motion cannot be granted if the facts, and their reasonable \r\n  inferences, demonstrate the plaintiff could prevail on a theory of the case.Â  \r\n  See Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 366, 353 S.E.2d 697, 698 \r\n  (1987).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTrancik argues the trial court erred by granting \r\n  USAAâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  He contends contractual privity existed between Trancik \r\n  and USAA by virtue of the assignment contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to the complaint, two contracts existed:Â  \r\n  the insurance contract between USAA and the at-fault driver and an assignment \r\n  contract between Wiggs and Trancik. Trancikâ€™s complaint alleges USAA breached \r\n  the assignment contract because Wiggs assigned her right to the insurance proceeds \r\n  to him, USAA had notice of the assignment, and USAA failed to pay the insurance \r\n  proceeds directly to him.\r\nTrancik argues USAAâ€™s receipt of the assignment \r\n  contract was sufficient to create contractual privity with USAA, citing Gray \r\n  v. State Farm Auto. Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 646, 491 S.E.2d 272 (Ct. App. 1997) \r\n  to support this contention.Â  We disagree with Trancikâ€™s reading of the case.\r\nIn Gray, two chiropractors obtained assignments from \r\n  patients stating any money collected from the patientsâ€™ insurance carriers was \r\n  assigned to the chiropractors.Â  The assignments did not include claims against \r\n  third-party carriers.Â  The chiropractors sent these assignments to third-party-insurance \r\n  companies, which refused to honor them.Â  As in this case, the patients failed \r\n  to pay the chiropractors, and the chiropractors sued the third-party-insurance \r\n  companies, claiming they breached the assignment contract between the chiropractors \r\n  and their patients.Â  \r\nThis Court ruled no contractual privity existed between \r\n  the chiropractors and the third-party-insurance companies, noting the assignments \r\n  did not purport to cover the patientsâ€™ claims against third parties or their \r\n  carriers.Â  The language of the purported assignments applied only to the patientsâ€™ \r\n  insurance carriers, not third-party carriers. Id. at 650, 491 S.E.2d \r\n  at 274.\r\nBecause the Gray court noted the plain language \r\n  of the assignments did not include claims against third-party insurers, the \r\n  Court did not consider whether such wording would create an obligation on the \r\n  part of a third-party insurer.Â  Gray held, as a matter of contract construction, \r\n  the chiropractors failed to allege a cause of action because third-party carriers \r\n  were not mentioned in the assignment.Â  However, Gray does not provide \r\n  that contractual privity is established merely by including third-party-insurance \r\n  claims in the assignment.Â  Thus, this case is inapposite. [2] Â  Furthermore, we believe Trancikâ€™s position is untenable.\r\nSouth Carolina contract law carries a presumption that an \r\n  individual who is not a party to a contract lacks privity to enforce it.Â  See \r\n  Touchberry v. City of Florence, 295 S.C. 47, 48-49, 367 S.E.2d 149, 150 \r\n  (1988).Â  By the same token, an individual who is not a party to a contract generally \r\n  cannot be liable for its breach.Â  See Holder v. Haskett, 283 S.C. \r\n  247, 251, 321 S.E.2d 192, 194 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nThe only parties to the assignment contract are Trancik and \r\n  Wiggs.Â  USAA is not a party to it.Â  Thus, unless USAAâ€™s insurance policy establishes \r\n  contractual privity with Wiggs or Trancik, no basis exists upon which USAA can \r\n  be held liable for breach of the assignment contract.Â  See Holder, \r\n  283 S.C. at 251, 321 S.E.2d at 194 (holding an individual who is not a party \r\n  to a contract cannot be liable for its breach).\r\nUnder the common law, â€œno privity [of contract exists] between \r\n  an injured person and the tortfeasorâ€™s liability insurer, and the injured person \r\n  has no right of action at law against the insurer.â€Â  44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance \r\n  Â§ 1445 (1982); see Major v. Natâ€™l Indem. Co., 267 S.C. 517, 520, \r\n  229 S.E.2d 849, 850 (1976) (holding â€œ[a]t common law, no right to maintain suit \r\n  directly against the insurer existed absent privity of contract between the \r\n  claimant and the insuredâ€); McPherson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 306 \r\n  S.C. 456, 464, 412 S.E.2d 445, 449 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding the insured clients \r\n  of an insured party were not in contractual privity with insuredâ€™s reinsurance \r\n  company because they were not a party to the reinsurance contract), affâ€™d \r\n  as modified by, 310 S.C. 316, 426 S.E.2d 770 (1993) (addressing whether \r\n  the injured party could sue the tortfeasorâ€™s insurance company, pursuant to \r\n  the policy, and not addressing whether the insured party could sue the reinsurance \r\n  company).\r\nThird-party-liability-insurance contracts are generally indemnity \r\n  contracts whereby the insurer, or the first party, agrees to pay the insured, \r\n  or the second party, the amount of any damages the insured may become legally \r\n  liable to pay a third party.Â  See Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, \r\n  Inc., 303 S.C. 52, 56, 398 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 1990); see also \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (2002) (â€œNo automobile insurance policy may be issued \r\n  . . . unless it contains a provision insuring the persons defined as insured \r\n  against loss from liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, \r\n  maintenance, or use of . . . [motor vehicles].â€).Â Â  Thus, the third party, or \r\n  the incidental beneficiary, does not have a contractual relationship with the \r\n  insurer and cannot maintain an action against the insurer for breach of the \r\n  insurance contract.Â  See Bob Hammond Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. \r\n  Co., 312 S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding a third \r\n  person not in contractual privity with the contracting parties has no right \r\n  to enforce a contract unless the contracting parties intended to create a direct, \r\n  rather than an incidental or consequential, benefit to that third person); see \r\n  also Kleckley v. Northwestern Natâ€™l Cas. Co., 338 S.C. 131, 136, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 218, 220 (2000) (holding an injured third party could not assert \r\n  a bad faith claim against a tortfeasorâ€™s insurance company because the injured \r\n  party was not a party to the contract); Major, 267 S.C. at 520, 229 S.E.2d \r\n  at 850.\r\nIn this case, Trancik does not claim the insurance \r\n  contract is anything but an indemnity contract. [3] Â  Furthermore, Trancik does not \r\n  assert that he or Wiggs is a third-party, as opposed to an incidental, beneficiary \r\n  of the insurance contract.Â  Thus, Trancik has not alleged a basis upon which \r\n  to assert the existence of contractual privity between Wiggs and USAA.Â  See \r\n  44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance Â§ 1445 (1982); Major, 267 S.C. at 520, \r\n  229 S.E.2d at 850; McPherson, 306 S.C. at 464, 412 S.E.2d at 449.Â  \r\nBecause Wiggs had no contractual privity with USAA, \r\n  Trancik received no greater right from Wiggs through her assignment.Â  See \r\n  Singletary v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 316 S.C. 199, 201, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  869, 870 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding an â€œassignee . . . stands in the shoes of \r\n  its assignorâ€); Rosemond v. Campbell, 288 S.C. 516, 522, 343 S.E.2d 641, \r\n  645 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œAt common law, an assigneeâ€™s rights can be no greater \r\n  than those of his assignor.â€).Â  Therefore, notwithstanding the obligations incurred \r\n  by Wiggs pursuant to the assignment contract, mere notification of the assignment \r\n  was insufficient to contractually bind USAA.Â  Taking Trancikâ€™s well-pled allegations \r\n  as true, USAA was not in privity of contract with Wiggs or Trancik and was not \r\n  a party to the assignment.Â  Therefore, USAA had no contractual duty to abide \r\n  by its terms.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is \r\n AFFIRMED.  [4] \r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Although Thomas Trancik, M.D., P.A. is a separate legal entity, we \r\n    refer to the Appellant as Trancik in his individual capacity for ease of writing.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Trancik also argues that the following cases support his position:Â  \r\n    Dunbar v. Johnston, 170 S.C. 160, 169 S.E. 846 (1933), Thomasson \r\n    v. Ocean Point Gulf, Inc., 300 S.C. 29, 386 S.E.2d 282 (Ct. App. 1989), \r\n    and Southern Gen. Factors, Inc. v. Parker Concrete Pile Co., 236 F. \r\n    Supp. 103 (D.S.C. 1964).Â  However, these cases are equally inapposite because \r\n    they apply to assignments of first-party benefits.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The USAA insurance policy is not included in the \r\n    record on appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The trial court also ruled the assignment was unenforceable because, \r\n    if valid, it would place an undue burden on USAA.Â  Because we agree with the \r\n    trial courtâ€™s ruling no contractual privity existed, we need not reach this \r\n    issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
