(1)  The master awarded Swanson $3,800 dollars on his quantum meruit claim\r\nagainst the Stratos family.  Swanson filed a motion to alter and amend the judgment and was\r\nawarded $1,342.92 in costs.  The Stratos family also moved to alter and amend the judgment\r\nasking the master to vacate the award to Swanson and enter judgment for them and to award\r\nattorney's fees and costs under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. \r\nThe master denied the motion.  The Stratos family appeals.  We reverse in part and affirm in part.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn February 1996, John Stratos and Milton Stratos, as representatives for their father's estate, hired\r\nSwanson, a licensed forester, to inventory and appraise the value of timber on a 561 acre tract of\r\nland owned by the estate and located in Cordesville, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAs he appraised the timber, Swanson noticed the presence \r\n  of a red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species. Federal regulations require \r\n  protection of this endangered species, which complicated the appraisal and future \r\n  sale of the timber. On April 30, 1996, Swanson offered to market the timber \r\n  to find a buyer at a suitable price, in return for which he was to receive a \r\n  commission of ten percent of the gross proceeds of the sale, less the twenty-five \r\n  hundred dollars he had already received for appraising the timber. Swanson informed \r\n  the Stratos family about the endangered species and his ability to resolve the \r\n  issue with regulatory agencies in order to sell the timber.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Stratos family and Swanson came to an oral agreement on April 30, 1996, the\r\nagreement was not reduced to writing except in a letter written by Swanson to the Stratos family\r\non November 11, 1996.  The November 11 letter described the terms of the sale and the duties\r\nSwanson had undertaken in selling the timber as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom March until our last meeting on November 8, 1996, I have done considerable work for the\r\nfamily in the following area: a number of meetings and phone calls with Westvaco and U.S. Fish\r\n&amp; Wildlife Service biologists to resolve the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker issue; development of the\r\nTimber Sale Prospectus, continuing talks with prospective buyers in on-going marketing of the\r\ntimber specified for sale in the Prospectus, marketing of the timber specified for sale in the\r\nProspectus, work in progress on the Habitat Conservation Plan (H.C.P.) to enable you to sell\r\ntimber on the 66 acre Block in 1997, and also three meetings with you as a group at Mrs. Stratos's\r\nhouse to keep all of you informed and to answer  questions concerning the sale of timber.\r\n\r\nMy fee of ten (10%) percent of the total proceeds from the Timber Sale covers my time in the\r\nabove duties as well as the following. 1) continued marketing of sale to assure best price, 2) when\r\nsale is consummated, I will assist in the development of the Timber Sales Contract to insure [sic]\r\nyour interests are protected, 3) [l]ogging supervision to insure [sic] contract compliance, full\r\naccounting of tonnage cut and hauled, 4) inspections as necessary to determine the extent of\r\nnatural regeneration, 5) coordination with various state and federal agencies to secure cost-share\r\nfunds for replanting whatever portion of tract is necessary, 6) supervision and coordination of site-prep and planting contract crews until acreage cut is productive again, 7) completion of [the]\r\nH.C.P. in order to get the go-ahead for the sale of timber on the 66 acre tract, 8) any other family\r\nmeetings or meetings with U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife personnel to complete [the]\r\nH.C.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nBetween April 30 and November 11, Swanson compiled a sales prospectus to market the timber. \r\nIncluded in the prospectus was a sixty-six acre area designated a reserved area for the red-cockaded woodpecker.  At trial, Swanson presented records indicating the time he spent creating\r\nthe set-aside. In support of his quantum meruit claim at trial, Swanson testified that he charged\r\n$100 an hour for these services if not included in a commission sales contract.\r\n\r\nAlthough Swanson received several offers to purchase and log the timber, all fell short of\r\nSwanson's suggested selling price, and he advised the Stratos family to wait until they received an\r\nacceptable offer. When no adequate bids were received, the Stratos family declined to sign a\r\nportion of Swanson's letter that would have extended the listing past November 11. \r\nSubsequently, a timber buyer for Elliott Sawmilling Company purchased the timber for $318,000\r\nin January 1997, after reviewing the paperwork involving the set-aside arranged by Swanson\r\nduring his listing contract. Elliot's buyer learned of the timber from a friend of John Stratos and\r\nhad neither received Swanson's prospectus nor had any contact with Swanson concerning the\r\nproposed sale during the listing period.\r\n\r\nOn October 7, 1997, Swanson filed his complaint, alleging breach of contract, breach of implied\r\ncontract, and quantum meruit causes of action. Swanson sought to obtain ten percent of the\r\npurchase price as his commission. The case was tried before a master-in-equity.\r\n\r\nThe master found an express contract was formed between the Stratos family and Swanson during\r\nthe April 30 meeting and the terms of that contract were expressed in the November 11 letter.  The\r\nmaster also found the contract terminated on November 11 and was not renewed.  The master\r\nfurther found that Elliott Sawmilling relied upon Swanson's set-aside when purchasing the timber\r\nand awarded Swanson $3,800 in quantum meruit for his work. (2) \r\n\r\nSwanson filed a motion to alter and amend the judgment and requested the award of court costs of\r\n$1,342.92.  The Stratos family also filed a motion to alter and amend the judgment,\r\nasking the\r\nmaster to render judgment for them against Swanson and award them costs and attorney's fees\r\nunder the Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act.  The master granted Swanson's motion and\r\nawarded costs of $1,342.92.  The master denied the Stratos family's motions.  The Stratos family\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Quantum Meruit\r\n\r\nThe Stratos family argues the master erred when he awarded Swanson $3,800 in quantum meruit\r\nbecause the duties associated with the creation of the set-aside were included in the express\r\ncontract.  We agree.\r\n\r\nTo prevail on a quantum meruit claim the plaintiff must \r\n  establish the following elements: 1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon \r\n  the defendant; 2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and 3) retention \r\n  of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable \r\n  for him to retain it without paying its value. Myrtle Beach Hosp. v. City \r\n  of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).\r\n\r\nIf the tasks the plaintiff is seeking compensation for under \r\n  a quantum meruit theory are encompassed within the terms of an express contract \r\n  which has not been abandoned or rescinded, the plaintiff may not recover under \r\n  quantum meruit. See 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied Contracts \r\n  Â§ 81 (2001) (&quot;[I]t is a defense to an action in quantum meruit that there \r\n  is an express contract covering the issue of compensation for services or materials \r\n  furnished.\"); cf. Strickland v. Coastal Design Assocs., 294 S.C. 421, \r\n  424, 365 S.E.2d 226, 228 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"The law is well settled in this nation \r\n  that where an express contract has been rescinded or abandoned, one furnishing \r\n  labor or materials in part performance may recover in quantum meruit unless \r\n  the original contract remains in force.\"); Johnston v. Brown, 290 S.C. \r\n  141, 148, 348 S.E.2d 391, 395 (Ct. App. 1986), rev'd on other grounds, \r\n  392 S.C. 478, 357 S.E.2d 450 (1987) (\"While a recovery may be had in quantum \r\n  meruit for services fully performed under an express contract, the plaintiff's \r\n  recovery is limited to the amount the parties agreed should be paid for the \r\n  services.\" (footnote omitted)). Furthermore, brokers are not entitled to payment \r\n  of commissions for the efforts taken to sell when their efforts do not result \r\n  in a sale. Webb v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 300 S.C. 507, 512, \r\n  388 S.E.2d 823, 826 (Ct. App. 1989), overruled in part on other grounds by \r\n  Myrtle Beach Hosp., 314 S.C. at 1, 532 S.E.2d at 868.\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] broker is never entitled to commissions for unsuccessful efforts.  The risk of failure is wholly\r\nhis.  The reward comes only with his success.  That is the plain contract and contemplation of the\r\nparties.  The broker may devote his time and labor, and expend his money with ever so much\r\ndevotion to the interests of his employer, and yet if he fails, if without effecting an agreement or\r\naccomplishing a bargain, he abandons the effort, or his authority is fairly and in good faith\r\nterminated, he gains no right to commissions.  He loses the labor and effort which was staked\r\nupon success.  And in such event it matters not that after his failure and the termination of his\r\nagency, what he has done proves of use and benefit to the principal.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 512, 388 S.E.2d at 826 (quoting Sibbald \r\n  v. Bethlehem Iron Co., 83 N.Y. 378, 383 (1881).\r\n\r\nHere, the master ruled that a contract was formed according \r\n  to the terms set forth in Swanson's November 11 letter and that the contract \r\n  ended and was not renewed. That ruling was not appealed and thus is the law \r\n  of the case. Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107, 113, 490 \r\n  S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997). The efforts that Swanson undertook to delineate and mark \r\n  the set-aside for the red-cockaded woodpecker were contained within the terms \r\n  of the express agreement as reflected by the November 11 letter, in which Swanson \r\n  acknowledged that his compensation was to come from the proceeds of the sale \r\n  of the timber. Swanson failed to sell the timber and the contract terminated. \r\n  Therefore, Swanson is not entitled to collect in quantum meruit.\r\n\r\nThe master also awarded Swanson $1,342.92 in costs on his \r\n  motion to amend or alter the judgment. In light of our decision to reverse the \r\n  award of damages to Swanson on his quantum meruit claim, Swanson has not succeeded \r\n  in any part of his lawsuit. Moreover, Swanson concedes in his brief that costs \r\n  were improperly awarded. Therefore, the award of costs to Swanson is reversed. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-37-20 (1976).\r\n\r\nII.  Frivolous Lawsuit Claim\r\n\r\nThe Stratos family argues that the master erred when he denied their motion to impose costs and\r\nattorney's fees against Swanson under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions\r\nAct (\"the Act\").  The Act provides that\r\n\r\n\r\n[a]ny person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil\r\nproceeding is subject to being assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorney's fees and\r\ncourt costs of the other party if:\r\n\r\n(1) he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of\r\nparties, or adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are based; and\r\n\r\n(2) the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an assessment of the fees and\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (Supp. 2001).  Section 15-36-20 provides that a party\r\n\r\n\r\nmust be considered to have acted to secure a proper purpose . . . if he reasonably believes in the\r\nexistence of the facts upon which his claim is based and\r\n\r\n(1)  reasonably believes that under those facts his claim may be valid under the existing or\r\ndeveloping law; or\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n(3) believes, as an attorney of record, in good faith that his procurement, initiation, continuation,\r\nor defense of a civil cause is not intended to merely harass or injure the other party.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-20 (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\nA decision to award costs under the Act is one in equity. \r\n  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1997). Accordingly, \r\n  this Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Id. \r\n  Our supreme court has held that if a cause of action survives pre-trial motions \r\n  to dismiss or a summary judgment motion and goes to the jury, the cause of action \r\n  cannot be considered frivolous. Id. at 157, 485 S.E.2d at 912 (\"Other \r\n  courts . . . hold that a party who survives pre-trial motions to dismiss and \r\n  for summary judgment are not subject to sanctions after a trial on the surviving \r\n  claims. The theory behind these cases is that if a case is submitted to the \r\n  jury, it cannot be deemed frivolous.\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, Swanson's quantum meruit action survived the Stratos family's motion for nonsuit\r\nbased upon the insufficiency of the evidence and was resolved upon the merits by the master. \r\nAlso, in viewing the factors listed in section 15-36-20, we find that Swanson reasonably believed\r\nhe had a claim against the Stratos family under existing case law.  At the time Swanson filed the\r\ncomplaint, a legitimate question of fact existed as to whether the oral agreement between the\r\nparties on April 30 and the subsequent writing of those terms in the November 11 letter would be\r\nconsidered an express contract by the trial court.  Therefore, the master's decision to deny the\r\nmotion for costs and attorney's fees was proper.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3)\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the master's decision is\r\n\r\nREVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART. (4)\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n1.   Swanson also sued Milton Stratos on these causes of action.  The master granted Milton Stratos's motion for\r\ninvoluntary nonsuit on all causes against him.  That ruling is unappealed, and he is not a party to this appeal.\r\n2. In arriving at this figure, the master multiplied the thirty-eight hours he found Swanson spent creating the set-aside by\r\nthe $100 hourly rate Swanson testified he would have charged if not working for commission.\r\n3.   Because we reverse on the grounds above, we need not address the Stratos family's other issues on appeal.\r\n4.   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3488","title":"State Auto Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co.  v.

The trial court found coverage existed under the policy but denied the \r\n  insureds' request for attorney fees. Both parties appeal. We affirm in part \r\n  and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nState Auto Insurance Company (State Auto) brought this declaratory \r\n  judgment action alleging that the insureds, David W. and Sherry B. Raynolds, \r\n  were not entitled to insurance coverage or a defense under their homeowner's \r\n  policy for injuries that occurred on their property when their dog bit Harold \r\n  Turner (Turner), a professional dog-handler. Turner filed suit against the Raynolds \r\n  to recover for his injuries. State Auto defended the suit under a reservation \r\n  of rights and sought to deny coverage based on the business pursuits exclusion \r\n  of the Raynolds' homeowner's policy.\r\n\r\nDavid Raynolds is a 70 year-old retired engineer with a \r\n  Ph.D. in chemical engineering. He and his wife operate a retail business selling \r\n  Merle Norman cosmetic products. They live in Spartanburg and have facilities \r\n  for breeding and raising Akita show dogs at their home. Each dog has its own \r\n  kennel with an 80 foot area for exercise. The kennel area is behind the Raynolds' \r\n  home.\r\n\r\nThe Raynolds purchased their first Akita in 1989 after their \r\n  son got an Akita. Soon thereafter, they purchased another Akita as a playmate \r\n  for their first dog. They eventually purchased additional dogs. Their dogs have \r\n  birthed five litters of puppies. The Raynolds have kept, given away, and sold \r\n  the puppies. The puppies sold for various amounts, ranging from $200 to $1500.\r\n\r\nThe Raynolds have traveled throughout several states to \r\n  attend dog shows, while professional handlers showed their dogs. The Raynolds \r\n  first met Harold Turner at a dog show in Atlanta. Turner came to South Carolina \r\n  on an unrelated matter and arranged to visit the Raynolds to determine if he \r\n  could show one of their dogs. Turner was bitten by one of the Akitas while working \r\n  with it. Turner filed a claim with State Auto, the Raynolds' homeowner's insurance \r\n  carrier. State Auto denied coverage pursuant to the business exclusions section \r\n  of the policy and filed this declaratory judgment action. The trial court relied \r\n  on the two-part test set forth in Fadden v. Cambridge Mutual Fire Insurance \r\n  Co., 274 N.Y.S.2d 235 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1966), and found State Auto was required \r\n  to defend the Raynolds and to provide insurance coverage under the homeowner's \r\n  policy up to the policy limits. The trial court also denied the Raynolds' claim \r\n  for attorney's fees. The Raynolds and State Auto appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\"A suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, \r\n  but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue. An issue essentially \r\n  one at law will not be transformed into one in equity simply because declaratory \r\n  relief is sought.\" Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d \r\n  781, 782 (1991). An insurance policy is a contract between the insured and the \r\n  insurance company. Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 \r\n  S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000). Contract actions are actions at law. Hofer \r\n  v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 508, 381 S.E.2d 736, 739 (1989). In an action \r\n  at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, we may not disturb a trial \r\n  court's findings of fact unless those findings are \"wholly unsupported by the \r\n  evidence or controlled by an erroneous conception or application of the law.\" \r\n  Maddux Supply Co. v. Safhi, Inc., 316 S.C. 404, 406, 450 S.E.2d 101, \r\n  102 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Business Pursuits Exclusion\r\n\r\nState Auto argues the trial court erred in holding that \r\n  the Raynolds' Akita activities do not constitute a business as defined in the \r\n  homeowner's policy. We disagree. \r\n\r\nInsurance policies are subject to general rules of contract \r\n  construction. Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v. Goforth, 312 S.C. 315, \r\n  318, 440 S.E.2d 367, 369 (1994). This court must interpret the language in an \r\n  insurance policy using its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Id. \r\n  However, ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must be construed \r\n  liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer. Diamond \r\n  State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  912, 915 (1995).\r\n\r\nThe applicable language in the Raynolds' policy reads: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Section II - EXCLUSIONS . . . . \r\n\r\n  Medical Payments to Others  do not apply \r\n    to bodily injury or property damage . . . b.(1) arising out of or in connection \r\n    with a business engaged in by an insured. \r\n    This exclusion applies but is not limited to an act or omission, regardless \r\n    of its nature or circumstance, involving a service or duty rendered, promised, \r\n    owed, or implied to be provided because of the nature of the business. . . \r\n    .\r\n\r\n\r\nAs defined in the main body of the policy, \"'business' \r\n  includes trade, profession, or occupation.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the two-part test set \r\n  forth in Fadden v. Cambridge Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 274 N.Y.S.2d \r\n  235 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1966), is an appropriate analysis for determining whether \r\n  the Raynolds' activity constituted a business under the policy provisions. This \r\n  test is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To constitute a business pursuit, there must be two elements: \r\n    first, continuity, and, secondly, the profit motive; as to the first, there \r\n    must be a customary engagement or a stated occupation; and, as to the latter, \r\n    there must be shown to be such activity as a means of livelihood, gainful \r\n    employment, means of earning a living, procuring subsistence or profit, commercial \r\n    transactions or engagements. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 241. \r\n\r\nAs to the continuity factor, the trial court stated, \"I \r\n  find that the Raynolds were not customarily engaged in the occupation, trade \r\n  or profession of raising and showing purebred Akitas. This was a part-time activity \r\n  on their part and they have other regular or continuous business engagements.\" \r\n  We agree that this activity was a hobby and not a customary engagement or occupation \r\n  for the Raynolds. The Raynolds bred and showed the Akitas as a part-time activity. \r\n  They had other regular or continuous business engagements in connection with \r\n  Merle Norman Cosmetics. Mr. Raynolds testified that his \"trade\" was not raising \r\n  or showing dogs, but rather it was chemical engineering. He admitted he was \r\n  retired, though he still does some chemical engineering consulting. He described \r\n  his activities with the Akitas as \"the sport of purebred dogs.\" The significant \r\n  amount of time and money the Raynolds spent on the dogs does not automatically \r\n  convert the activity to a business pursuit. \r\n\r\nThe second prong of the Fadden test requires a profit \r\n  motive. The trial court found, \"the Raynolds' activit[y] with their dogs was \r\n  not intended to be, nor has it ever been, a means of livelihood, gainful employment, \r\n  means of earning a living, procuring subsistence or profit.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that there was no profit motive \r\n  in the Akita activities. Mr. Raynolds testified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       Have you or will you ever expect to \r\n        make money off the breeding of dogs?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       It's almost inconceivable, unless a \r\n        multi-millionaire decided he wanted to give me a big check. That is sort \r\n        of like winning the lottery. I don't have any big hopes for winning the \r\n        lottery.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Raynolds generated income from the dogs during some \r\n  years, but never greater than their expenses for the same years. The evidence \r\n  does not indicate there was a profit motive in connection with the Akita dogs, \r\n  and we find the trial court did not err in finding the show breeding activity \r\n  was not a business pursuit. \r\n\r\nII. Testimony of Fran Keys\r\n\r\nState Auto argues the trial court erred in admitting the \r\n  testimony of Fran Keys as an expert in the field of professional dog showing. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility \r\n  of their testimony is largely within the discretion of the trial court. Creed \r\n  v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 344-45, 426 S.E.2d 785, 786 (1993)). \r\n  We will not disturb a trial court's ruling to exclude or admit expert testimony \r\n  absent a clear abuse of discretion. Walker v. Bluffs Apartments, 324 \r\n  S.C. 350, 353, 477 S.E.2d 472, 473 (Ct. App. 1996). A court may rule that an \r\n  expert witness is competent if the witness has acquired through study or experience \r\n  or both, such knowledge and skill in a business, profession, or science that \r\n  she is more qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the subject of her \r\n  testimony. Id.\r\n\r\nKeys was offered as an expert capable of testifying \"about \r\n  primarily the distinction between the amateur show handling and the professional \r\n  show handling involved in the dog business.\" The trial court limited her testimony \r\n  to this specific area and did not allow questions about legal issues. The distinction \r\n  between amateur and professional dog-handling is not common knowledge, and Keys \r\n  had special knowledge to explain this distinction in connection with the Raynolds. \r\n  We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting her testimony.\r\n\r\nIII. Attorney Fees\r\n\r\nThe Raynolds argue the trial court erred in denying their \r\n  claim for attorney's fees in the declaratory judgment action. We agree.\r\n\r\nAttorney's fees are generally not recoverable unless authorized \r\n  by contract or statute. Keeney's Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri, 345 \r\n  S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 2001). The Raynolds do not assert \r\n  any statutory right to recover, so they must recover, if at all, upon a contractual \r\n  right.\r\n\r\nWe find that Hegler v. Gulf Insurance Co., 270 S.C. \r\n  548, 243 S.E.2d 443 (1978) is controlling in the present case. In Hegler, \r\n  the issue was whether an insured is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred \r\n  in the successful defense of a declaratory judgment action brought by the insurer \r\n  in an effort to relieve itself of coverage under an insurance policy. Id. \r\n  at 548, 243 S.E.2d at 443. In finding the insurer was required to pay attorney \r\n  fees, the Hegler court held the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is no material difference in the legal effect between \r\n    an outright refusal to defend and in undertaking the defense under a reservation \r\n    of rights until a declaratory judgment is prosecuted to resolve the question \r\n    of coverage. In either event, an insured must employ counsel to defend - in \r\n    the first instance in the damage action and in the second in the declaratory \r\n    judgment action to force the insurer to provide the defense. In both, the \r\n    counsel fees are incurred because of the insurer's disclaimer of any obligation \r\n    to defend.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 550, 243 S.E.2d at 444. In 1997, our supreme \r\n  court expressly declined to overrule Hegler  and upheld an award of attorney's \r\n  fees. See First Fin. Ins. Co. v. Sea Island Sport Fishing Soc'y, Inc., \r\n  327 S.C. 12, 17, 490 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe legal fees incurred by the Raynolds in successfully \r\n  asserting their rights against State Auto's declaratory judgment action were \r\n  damages arising directly as a result of the breach of the contract. Based on \r\n  our reading of Hegler, the Raynolds are entitled to attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3489","title":"State v.

Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Sharron Jarrell was charged \r\n  with homicide by child abuse, accessory before the fact of murder, accessory \r\n  after the fact of murder, first degree criminal sexual conduct, and three counts \r\n  of unlawful conduct towards a child. A jury found Jarrell guilty of all charges \r\n  except criminal sexual conduct first degree. She appeals her convictions alleging \r\n  several errors occurred during the trial. (1) \r\n  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn June 25, 1998, Jarrell called EMS and reported that her \r\n  ten- month-old baby, Donald Jarrell Jr., was not breathing. When paramedics \r\n  arrived, they found the baby was dead and rigor mortis had begun to set in. \r\n  When the police arrived at the residence they observed that the trailer was \r\n  filthy with animal feces, fly strips, baby bottles with clabbered milk, unwashed \r\n  dishes, dirty diapers, and it smelled of urine. Residing at the trailer with \r\n  Jarrell at the time of the baby's death were Donald Jarrell Sr. (Father), Jarrell's \r\n  mother Grenetta Blaskey, and Jarrell's three other minor children. The Department \r\n  of Social Services took temporary emergency custody of the three children due \r\n  to the condition of the residence.\r\n\r\nAfter an autopsy, the coroner found the baby had suffered \r\n  severe repeated sexual abuse and determined that he died from suffocation and \r\n  smothering the previous day. Investigators asked Jarrell about her whereabouts \r\n  and activities on that date. She responded that she had been shopping with her \r\n  mother and children. After receiving a page from her husband, she returned home \r\n  around 9 P.M.\r\n\r\nShe initially stated that when she returned home she checked \r\n  on the baby, kissed him goodnight, and he seemed fine. However, Jarrell later \r\n  changed her story and stated that she thought Father smothered the baby because \r\n  of his bad temper and he could not handle the baby's crying. Later, she changed \r\n  her story again and said that she knew the baby was dead when she returned home \r\n  that evening, but she did not call an ambulance that night because she did not \r\n  want to upset her mother and children. The next morning upon \"discovering\" her \r\n  baby's death, Jarrell immediately called Father at work, and then called EMS. \r\n  That same day, she reported the baby's death to the insurance company which \r\n  had issued a $24,000 life insurance policy on the child.\r\n\r\nJarrell and Father were arrested for the death of her baby. \r\n  After her arrest, she admitted to police that she knew Father was molesting \r\n  the baby. While in jail, Jarrell discussed the abuse and death of her baby with \r\n  several inmates: Mary Gillespy, Julie Williams, Angela Doctor, and Tracye Graves. \r\n  In her conversations with these inmates, Jarrell admitted she used a dildo on \r\n  the baby to prepare him for sex with Father. She also stated that she and Father \r\n  planned to kill the baby by smothering him to make it appear to be a SIDS death \r\n  because the baby had an upcoming doctor's appointment and the abuse would be \r\n  readily apparent to anyone examining the baby. Jarrell and Father planned that \r\n  he would kill the baby while Jarrell was out shopping and he would page her \r\n  to return home when the baby was dead.\r\n\r\nFather was charged with murder, to which he pled guilty \r\n  but mentally ill. Jarrell was indicted for homicide by child abuse, accessory \r\n  before the fact of murder, accessory after the fact of murder, and first degree \r\n  criminal sexual conduct. Jarrell was convicted on all counts except criminal \r\n  sexual conduct. She received life sentences for the homicide by child abuse \r\n  and accessory before the fact convictions, and fifteen years for the accessory \r\n  after the fact conviction, concurrent to her life sentences.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Directed Verdict on Homicide by \r\n  Child Abuse Charge\r\n\r\nJarrell first claims the trial court erred by failing to \r\n  grant her a directed verdict on the homicide by child abuse charge. \r\n  (2) We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the trial court's denial of a criminal \r\n  defendant's motion for directed verdict, \"[w]e must view the evidence in the \r\n  light most favorable to the State and determine whether there is any direct \r\n  or substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove the defendant's \r\n  guilt or from which his guilt may be logically deduced.\" State v. Pinckney, \r\n  339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000). In ruling on a directed verdict \r\n  motion, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of \r\n  evidence, not its weight. Id. Furthermore, \"[i]f the State presents any \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendant's guilt or from which \r\n  the defendant's guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, the case must go \r\n  to the jury.\" State v. Harris, 342 S.C. 191, 203, 535 S.E.2d 652, 658 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nThe jury found Jarrell guilty of homicide by child abuse \r\n  \"under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (Supp. 2001). Jarrell argues the trial court erred \r\n  in denying her motion for directed verdict because the State failed to prove \r\n  the proper mental state. Specifically, she claims the evidence presented at \r\n  trial showed she participated in planning the death of the baby which would \r\n  constitute malice. She contends that because one cannot have both malice and \r\n  indifference towards another person, she could not be guilty of homicide under \r\n  circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.\r\n\r\nJarrell defines indifference as \"impartial, unbiased, or \r\n  disinterested.\" Under her definition, she contends that any action, or \r\n  failure to act in the face of a duty, would negate her indifference, thus making \r\n  it impossible for her to be guilty under this specific statute. Jarrell's definition, \r\n  however, fails to focus on the term extreme indifference  as it has historically \r\n  been interpreted in a criminal context.\r\n\r\nExtreme indifference is in the nature of \"a culpable mental \r\n  state . . . and therefore is akin to intent.\" State v. Vowell, 634 S.W.2d \r\n  118, 119 (Ark. 1982) (citation omitted). In this state, indifference in the \r\n  context of criminal statutes has been compared to the conscious act of disregarding \r\n  a risk which a person's conduct has created, or a failure to exercise ordinary \r\n  or due care. See State v. Rowell, 326 S.C. 313, 315, 487 S.E.2d 185, \r\n  186 (1997) (discussing the requisite mental state for recklessness); see \r\n  generally Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999) \r\n  (\"Conduct of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties \r\n  may fairly be characterized as wilful because it manifests a conscious indifference \r\n  to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.\"). \r\n  At least one other jurisdiction with a similar statute has found that \"[a] person \r\n  acts 'under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human \r\n  life' when he engages in deliberate conduct which culminates in the death of \r\n  some person.\" Davis v. State, 925 S.W.2d 768, 773 (Ark. 1996). Therefore, \r\n  we reject Jarrell's definition of the term indifference and hold that in the \r\n  context of homicide by abuse statutes, extreme indifference is a mental state \r\n  akin to intent characterized by a deliberate act culminating in death.\r\n\r\nIn light of this definition of extreme indifference, and \r\n  after reviewing the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the denial \r\n  of Jarrell's motion for directed verdict. The State presented evidence of Jarrell's \r\n  actions in planning the murder both before it occurred, and also presented evidence \r\n  of her actions on the day of the child's death. Two different levels of intent \r\n  may be gleaned from her actions depending on the particular point in time. We \r\n  find the events of the day of the baby's death to be the most significant to \r\n  our analysis regarding Jarrell's extreme indifference. We agree with Jarrell \r\n  that her conviction of accessory before the fact of murder indicated she acted \r\n  with malice aforethought in planning the murder of her child. See State v. \r\n  Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998) (\"Malice is the wrongful \r\n  intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent on \r\n  doing wrong.\"). However, Jarrell's affirmative act of leaving her home on the \r\n  day of the murder operates as a separate and distinct event from the planning \r\n  of the murder. (3) When she left home, Jarrell \r\n  created a grave risk of death to her child, evidencing her extreme indifference \r\n  to his life. She left home knowing her child would be killed while she was gone. \r\n  Jarrell could have prevented the murder of her son merely by choosing to stay \r\n  home. Her failure to protect her child is concrete evidence of her indifference \r\n  towards his life.\r\n\r\nA parent has a specific and undelegable duty to serve the \r\n  best interests of her child and should make every effort not to knowingly place \r\n  her child in harm's way. See generally Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 530, 536, \r\n  381 S.E.2d 913, 916 (Ct. App. 1989) (stating parents have a duty to lend their \r\n  aid in creating an atmosphere that will foster the best interests of their child). \r\n  We can think of no better example of someone who is indifferent towards life \r\n  than a mother who leaves her child knowing he will be killed in her absence. \r\n  Therefore, in light of our holding as to the definition of \"extreme indifference\" \r\n  in the context of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85, we find there is ample evidence \r\n  to support the trial court's denial of the motion for directed verdict.\r\n\r\nII. Written Statement of Mary Gillespy\r\n\r\nMary Gillespy was an inmate incarcerated with Jarrell prior \r\n  to trial. Jarrell discussed the circumstances of her case with Gillespy. Gillespy \r\n  testified that Jarrell told her she was aware months before her son's death \r\n  that her husband was sexually abusing their son. She further stated to Gillespy \r\n  that she participated in the abuse and would often use a dildo on the baby while \r\n  she and her husband were having sex. Jarrell told her that the baby had an enlarged \r\n  rectum because of the abuse and she was concerned it would be discovered during \r\n  an upcoming pediatrician's appointment. Gillespy made a written statement to \r\n  police regarding the conversations she had with Jarrell. At trial, the State \r\n  presented Gillespy as a witness and sought to introduce her prior written statement \r\n  during her direct examination. The trial court admitted the statement over objection. \r\n  Jarrell contends the trial court erred when it admitted the written statement \r\n  because it improperly bolstered Gillespy's testimony to the jury. We agree but \r\n  find the error harmless.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Evidence permit the admission \r\n  of hearsay evidence of a prior consistent statement to rebut an allegation that \r\n  the declarant recently fabricated the story or acted out of an improper influence \r\n  or motive. Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE. In State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, \r\n  123-24, 551 S.E.2d 240, 245-46 (2001), our supreme court held that the admission \r\n  of a witness's prior consistent statement was improper if the witness had not \r\n  been accused of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive prior to \r\n  the admission of the statement. The Saltz court further stated that any \r\n  error in admitting the prior consistent statement, even though cumulative to \r\n  the witness's testimony at trial, would not be considered harmless. \"On the \r\n  contrary, 'it is precisely this cumulative effect which enhances the devastating \r\n  impact of improper corroboration.'\" Id. at 124, 551 S.E.2d at 246. The \r\n  court found the witness's testimony weak and \"not particularly credible,\" thus \r\n  the improper corroboration could not have been harmless.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we agree that the admission of Gillespy's \r\n  prior statement was improper because the admission occurred during the State's \r\n  direct examination and was not admitted in response to any allegations of recent \r\n  fabrication or improper influence or motive. Here, unlike Saltz, we find \r\n  this error harmless. In Saltz, the court was concerned that the prior \r\n  oral statement would improperly bolster the credibility of the declarant's \r\n  own oral testimony. (4) That concern \r\n  is diminished in this case, however, because Gillespy's statement is cumulative \r\n  not only to her own testimony, but to the testimony of three other witnesses. \r\n  Doctor, Graves, and Williams all testified to the same information contained \r\n  in Gillespy's written statement, i.e. that Jarrell participated in the sexual \r\n  abuse of the baby and planned to kill the baby to hide the abuse from the doctor. \r\n  If Gillespy's testimony was the only evidence of Jarrell's participation in \r\n  the abuse and death of her child, we would be constrained to hold that the improper \r\n  admission of the statement could not be harmless. However, because Gillespy's \r\n  testimony was cumulative to three other witnesses who testified almost identically, \r\n  we find the admission of Gillespy's statement harmless. Jarrell was not prejudiced \r\n  by the admission of the written statement when its contents were corroborated \r\n  by an abundance of properly admitted testimony from other witnesses. See \r\n  State v. South, 285 S.C. 529, 535, 331 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1985) (stating court \r\n  erred in admitting officer's notes because they were a prior consistent statement, \r\n  but held \"error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt since [notes were] cumulative \r\n  to the abundant amount of similar evidence admitted at trial\"). Thus, because \r\n  we find Gillespy's statement cumulative and substantially identical to other \r\n  properly admitted evidence, any error caused by the admission of the prior consistent \r\n  statement is harmless.\r\n\r\nIII. Expert Witness Testimony\r\n\r\nJarrell next argues the trial court erred by not admitting \r\n  the testimony of two expert witnesses, Dr. Pamela Crawford and Dr. Geoffrey \r\n  McKee. We disagree. \r\n\r\nRule 702, SCRE, allows the testimony of an expert witness \r\n  qualified by knowledge, experience, skill, training, or education to assist \r\n  the jury to understand the evidence or determine an issue. However, even if \r\n  evidence is admissible under Rule 702, SCRE, it may still be excluded under \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE, if its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. \r\n  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 96, 544 S.E.2d 30, 35 (2001). \"The question \r\n  of whether to admit or exclude testimony of an expert witness is within the \r\n  discretion of the trial court. Absent a clear abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law, the trial court's ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.\" \r\n  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 474, 523 S.E.2d 787, 794 (1999).\r\n\r\nA. Dr. Crawford's Testimony\r\n\r\nJarrell proffered the testimony and written report of Dr. \r\n  Pamela Crawford, a forensic psychiatrist, who examined Father to determine his \r\n  mental competency to stand trial. Jarrell contends the trial court erred in \r\n  excluding Dr. Crawford's testimony because it was relevant and would have shown \r\n  that Jarrell and Father were incapable of planning the murder. \r\n  (5) Jarrell argues this evidence could have affected the jury's deliberations \r\n  on both the homicide by child abuse and accessory before the fact charges.\r\n\r\nDr. Crawford testified that \"insofar as the murder charge\" \r\n  against him, Father lacked the capacity to conform his behavior to the requirements \r\n  of the law at the time the murder occurred. She stated that she based her opinion \r\n  \"on my understanding that he had done this act in an impulsive way without planning \r\n  when he was . . . experiencing symptoms that are consistent with hypomania.\" \r\n  However, she did not exclude the possibility that Father could have planned \r\n  the baby's death with his wife prior to the event, but at the actual time of \r\n  the event of death the act was impulsive. She went on to testify that her opinion \r\n  was based on an \"assumption that it was an impulsive not planned act,\" and further \r\n  stated that she \"would have a different opinion if, if I were to know that they \r\n  had planned this act, he would have had the capacity to conform if that were \r\n  the case.\" The trial court granted the State's motion to exclude Dr. Crawford's \r\n  testimony stating that \"her testimony as I understand it to be his lack of ability \r\n  to conform does not negate [Father's] ability to plan and . . . so I find that \r\n  it's not relevant to the issues before the court.\" \r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial judge that Father's state of mind \r\n  when he committed the murder has no probative bearing on his capacity to plan. \r\n  Father's mental state at the time he committed the act is irrelevant to whether \r\n  Jarrell was an accessory before the fact. An accessory is \"[a] person who aids \r\n  in the commission of a felony or is an accessory before the fact in a commission \r\n  of a felony by counseling, hiring, or otherwise procuring the felony to be committed. \r\n  . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-40 (Supp. 2001). The important inquiry is whether \r\n  Jarrell helped to plan, counsel, aid, or procure the crime. Jarrell's argument \r\n  that because the murder was an impulsive act it is unlikely the parties planned \r\n  the murder is without merit because the two are not mutually exclusive. Dr. \r\n  Crawford could not state unequivocally that the murder was impulsive, nor could \r\n  she state that even if it was an impulsive act at the time, that Father and \r\n  Jarrell could not have planned the murder beforehand. Moreover, Crawford admitted \r\n  her opinion was based on an \"assumption\" that the act was impulsive. This assumption \r\n  is not probative of whether or not Father and Jarrell planned to kill the child. \r\n  Therefore, because the testimony was not relevant to the issue of whether Jarrell \r\n  and Father could have planned the death of their child, we find no error in \r\n  the trial court's exclusion of Crawford's testimony.\r\n\r\nB. Dr. McKee's Testimony \r\n\r\nJarrell next proffered the testimony of Dr. Geoffrey McKee, \r\n  a forsenic psychologist, who examined her to see if she fit the profile of a \r\n  pedophile. McKee testified that Jarrell did not fit the \"diagnostic qualifications \r\n  for pedophilia\"; however, the trial court refused to allow his testimony. Jarrell \r\n  argues this testimony should have been admitted because it was relevant to show \r\n  that she would be unlikely to engage in the sexual abuse and, therefore, would \r\n  not have been involved in a plan with Father to kill their baby to cover up \r\n  the sexual abuse. We disagree.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note that the jury failed to convict Jarrell \r\n  on the CSC charge. As a result, Jarrell's argument that she was prejudiced by \r\n  the exclusion of McKee's testimony, showing she was less likely to engage in \r\n  the sexual abuse of a child, is without merit. Jarrell cannot claim to be prejudiced \r\n  by the exclusion of evidence as it relates to a particular charge when she was \r\n  not convicted of that charge. (6) See McCall \r\n  v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating that \r\n  this court has long recognized an overriding rule of civil procedure that \"whatever \r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter\").\r\n\r\nWe further find that McKee's testimony has no relevance \r\n  to this case. Rule 401, SCRE, allows the admission of evidence which has a tendency \r\n  to make any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more \r\n  or less probable than it would be without the evidence. State v. Hamilton, \r\n  344 S.C. 344, 353, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001). In this case, Jarrell \r\n  was alleged to have participated in the sexual abuse of her son. If true, these \r\n  allegations would have classified Jarrell not as a pedophile, but as an incest \r\n  abuser. These are two different classifications which require two different \r\n  sets of proof. \"Pedophilia has been defined as 'sexual perversion in which children \r\n  [in general] are the preferred sex object.'\" State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. \r\n  1, 19, 501 S.E.2d 716, 725, n.5 (1998) (citation omitted). Incest, however, \r\n  is sexual abuse relating to kinship between abuser and victim. See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-20 (Supp. 2001). \"At least one modern commentator takes the \r\n  view that the incest offender's chief aberrancy is incest and that, usually, \r\n  there is no history of other sexually related problems occurring outside the \r\n  family.\" State v. Person, 564 A.2d 626, 632 (Conn. App. Ct. 1989).\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Circuit has recognized the differences in these \r\n  classifications and how they impact expert testimony. In U.S. v. Powers, \r\n  59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995), the court upheld the district court's exclusion \r\n  of expert testimony claiming to prove the defendant did not fit the \"psychological \r\n  profile of a fixated pedophile,\" based on the expert's failure to establish \r\n  relevance to the facts in the case. Powers was charged with statutory rape of \r\n  his minor daughter, i.e., incest abuse, not with being a fixated pedophile. \r\n  The court held that \"[t]o be relevant, [the expert's] testimony must show, in \r\n  a very real way, that because Powers did not share a characteristic common to \r\n  . . . incest perpetrators, he was less likely to be an incest perpetrator himself.\" \r\n  Id. at 1472. The court noted, however, that had Powers offered evidence \r\n  showing that those who are not fixated pedophiles are less likely to commit \r\n  incest abuse, the expert's testimony might have been relevant. Accordingly, \r\n  the Fourth Circuit found no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of this testimony, \r\n  finding Powers failed to prove \"relevancy 'or a valid scientific connection \r\n  to the pertinent inquiry' of whether he committed incest.\" Id. at 1472-73; \r\n  see also State v. Person, 564 A.2d at 632 (\"Because the defendant never \r\n  established that his expert witnesses had expertise in areas directly related \r\n  to intrafamily sexual abuse, the trial court could reasonably have concluded \r\n  that it was unlikely that their testimony would be of help to the jury.\"). Because \r\n  there are significant differences in the identification and diagnosis of incest \r\n  abusers and pedophiles, we do not feel that McKee's testimony was relevant.\r\n\r\nIV. Admission of the Dildo Into Evidence\r\n\r\nAt trial, a dildo found in Grenata Blaskey's room during \r\n  a search of the trailer, was admitted into evidence. (7) \r\n  At trial, Jarrell objected to the admission of the dildo into evidence on \"relevance \r\n  grounds.\" On appeal, however, Jarrell argues (1) that pursuant to Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE, the prejudicial impact of admission of the dildo outweighed its probative \r\n  value because there was no connection between the dildo and the crime committed, \r\n  and (2) the admission of the dildo impugned the character and credibility of \r\n  her mother's testimony. Because Jarrell failed to make these arguments at trial, \r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review. See State v. Taylor, 333 \r\n  S.C. 159, 174, 508 S.E.2d 870, 877 (1998) (stating an objection which does not \r\n  specify the particular ground on which the objection is based is insufficient \r\n  to preserve the question for appellate review); Holy Loch Distrib., Inc., \r\n  v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E2d 282, 284 (2000).\r\n\r\nV. Autopsy Photographs\r\n\r\nJarrell contends the trial court should have excluded autopsy \r\n  photographs pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, because their prejudicial impact substantially \r\n  outweighed their probative value. Specifically, she claims it was not necessary \r\n  to admit the photographs because the pathologist testified about the cause of \r\n  death and sexual abuse, and because she offered to stipulate that the baby had \r\n  been sexually abused. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The relevance, materiality, and admissibility of photographs \r\n  are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will \r\n  be disturbed only upon a showing of abuse of discretion.\" State v. Rosemond, \r\n  335 S.C. 593, 596, 518 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1999). A test to determine whether \r\n  the trial court abused its discretion is whether the photographic evidence serves \r\n  to corroborate the testimony of witnesses offered at trial. \"If the photograph \r\n  serves to corroborate testimony, it is not abuse of discretion to admit it.\" \r\n  Id. at 597, 518 S.E.2d at 590.\r\n\r\nThe State offered several autopsy photographs arguing the \r\n  photographs were necessary to corroborate the testimony of the pathologist and \r\n  show the extent of the baby's sexual abuse. We agree that the photographs were \r\n  necessary to corroborate the testimony presented at trial. A photograph displaying \r\n  the anal injuries due to the sexual abuse corroborated both the pathologist's \r\n  testimony regarding the extent of those injuries and the witnesses' testimony \r\n  that Jarrell's motive for planning to kill the baby was because the sexual abuse \r\n  was readily apparent. Significantly, the trial court did not admit all the photographs, \r\n  giving the State a choice between two photographs depicting the same injury. \r\n  We find the trial court's exclusion of photographs demonstrates it exercised \r\n  its discretion. Furthermore, the autopsy photographs corroborated the testimony \r\n  about the condition of the child. The photographs showed the baby in a state \r\n  of rigor and in the beginning stages of decomposition and corroborated the pathologist's \r\n  testimony about the time of death. These photos support the charge against Jarrell \r\n  of accessory after the fact. We agree with the trial judge, that while some \r\n  of \"the photograph[s] are graphic, the facts of the case are very graphic\" and \r\n  the photos helped the jury understand the pathologist's testimony. Therefore, \r\n  under these circumstances, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in admitting the autopsy photographs.\r\n\r\nVI. Exculpatory Evidence\r\n\r\nFinally, Jarrell argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to find that a pending investigation for armed robbery against a State's witness \r\n  was exculpatory evidence which should have been disclosed to the defense pursuant \r\n  to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). We disagree.\r\n\r\nAngela Doctor was one of four women incarcerated with Jarrell \r\n  who testified against her. After Doctor was released from prison, she became \r\n  a suspect in an armed robbery case. However, at the time of Jarrell's trial, \r\n  no charges were pending against her and she was unaware that she was a suspect. \r\n  The State and defense agreed to a hearing in chambers to determine whether the \r\n  State should have disclosed this information to the defense prior to trial. \r\n  (8) The trial court found that this information did not need to be \r\n  disclosed to the defense, ruling it was not exculpatory and could not be used \r\n  for impeachment purposes.\r\n\r\n\"A Brady claim is based upon the requirement of due \r\nprocess. Such a claim is complete if the accused can demonstrate (1) the evidence \r\nwas favorable to the accused, (2) it was in possession of or known to the prosecution, \r\n(3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and (4) it was material to guilt or \r\npunishment.\" Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999) \r\n(citations omitted). \"Exculpatory evidence is that which creates a reasonable \r\ndoubt about the defendant's guilt.\" State v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 360, \r\n468 S.E.2d 641, 645 (1996). Exculpatory evidence is material only if there is \r\na reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the \r\nproceeding would have been different. Fradella v. Town of Mount Pleasant, \r\n325 S.C. 469, 479, 482 S.E.2d 53, 58 (Ct. App. 1997). A Brady violation \r\noccurs if a defendant can demonstrate \"that favorable evidence could [have been \r\npresented] to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence \r\nin the verdict.\" Id. (citation omitted). \r\nIn this case, we do not believe an investigation of a witness \r\n  for an uncharged offense creates a reasonable probability that the outcome of \r\n  the proceeding would have been different had the information been disclosed. \r\n  Looking at the evidence as a whole, Doctor was one of four women who testified \r\n  almost identically against Jarrell. Doctor's alleged involvement in an uncharged \r\n  crime simply has no bearing on Jarrell's guilt. Moreover, the information could \r\n  not be used for impeachment purposes since an uncharged offense is not probative \r\n  of the truthfulness of the witness. Thus, we find no error in the trial court's \r\n  ruling that the State was not required to disclose this information to the defense.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. Jarrell does not appeal her convictions \r\n  on three counts of unlawful conduct towards a child. \r\n2. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 (Supp. 2001) \r\n  defines the crime as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (A) A person is guilty of homicide by child abuse if the \r\n    person:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n    (1) causes the death of a child under the age of eleven \r\n      while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death occurs under circumstances \r\n      manifesting an extreme indifference to human life; or\r\n\r\n    (2) knowingly aids and abets another person to commit child \r\n      abuse or neglect, and the child abuse or neglect results in the death of \r\n      a child under eleven. \r\n  \r\n\r\n3. Although some jurisdictions have held \r\n  that premeditation is not required to show extreme indifference, other states \r\n  have held that premeditation may coexist with extreme indifference towards human \r\n  life. See Davis, 925 S.W.2d at 773; State v. Crowsbreast, 629 \r\n  N.W.2d 433, 440 (Minn. 2001) (\"It is possible for premeditation and extreme \r\n  indifference to coexist.\"); State v. Russell, 848 P.2d 743, 748 (Wash. \r\n  Ct. App. 1993) (stating neither premeditation nor intent is required under homicide \r\n  by abuse statute in which death is caused under circumstances manifesting an \r\n  extreme indifference to human life). \r\n4. We note that unlike the present case, \r\n  the prior consistent statement in Saltz was admitted during the testimony \r\n  of another witness who was not the declarant of the prior consistent statement. \r\n5. Jarrell also claims Dr. Crawford should \r\n  have been admitted to testify as to the definition of guilty but mentally ill. \r\n  However, because Jarrell failed to raise this issue at trial, the issue is not \r\n  preserved for our review. See Holy Loch Distrib., Inc., v. Hitchcock, \r\n  340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E2d 282, 284 (2000) (stating that issues not raised and \r\n  ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal). \r\n6. Although Jarrell was acquitted of \r\n  CSC conduct charge, she claims the exclusion of Dr. McKee's testimony was still \r\n  prejudicial because it would have diminished the credibility of the witnesses \r\n  who testified that Jarrell told them she was involved in the sexual abuse and \r\n  planning to kill her baby. We do not find this argument persuasive. An expert \r\n  is not necessary for the jury to determine the credibility and truthfulness \r\n  of the witnesses. See Duncan v. State, 500 S.E.2d 603, 608 (Ga. Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (finding profile testimony defendant sought to introduce at trial went \r\n  to credibility of his own testimony and that jury, without help of expert, could \r\n  have determined the credibility and truthfulness of all the witnesses and could \r\n  have formed independent opinions as to defendant's capability to commit acts). \r\n 7. No blood or fingerprints were found \r\n  on the dildo. \r\n8. We note that the record indicates \r\n  the hearing was instigated at the State's request out of concern of a possible \r\n  appearance that Doctor may have testified with an expectation of leniency if \r\n  subsequently charged with armed robbery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3490","title":"Beaufort County v.

The trial court held the annexation was\r\nproper and Appellants lacked standing to challenge the ordinance.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 1999, Flora G. Trask petitioned to have the City annex both her property on Upper Cane Island and the\r\nportion of the Beaufort River located between the City and Trask's property.  Trask made her request using the \"100-per\r\ncent\" method under South Carolina Code section 5-3-150. (1)  On February 9, 1999, the Beaufort City Council granted the\r\npetition and enacted an ordinance providing for the City's annexation of both Trask's property and the waters and marshes\r\nof the Beaufort River between that property and the previous city limits.\r\n\r\nOn April 7, 1999, Appellants filed a notice of intention to contest the annexation ordinance.  On May 6, 1999, Appellants\r\nfiled their summons and complaint in the present case.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1999, the Town of Port Royal sued the City, alleging that the Town's municipal boundaries extended to the\r\neastern marsh of the Beaufort River and that the City, in enacting the ordinance, had crossed those water boundaries to gain\r\ncontiguity to Trask's property on Upper Cane Island.  The action was dismissed in September 1999 pursuant to an\r\nagreement between the Town and the City that devised a clear line of delineation between the two municipalities.  The\r\nagreement provided the City would modify the water boundaries in the ordinance and the Town would acknowledge the\r\nannexation ordinance, as modified, was \"legal and valid.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 1999, Appellants amended their pleadings to join Trask, the State of South Carolina, and the Town as\r\ndefendants.  In their amended complaint, Appellants alleged three grounds for invalidating the ordinance:  (1) the property\r\nsought to be annexed was not contiguous to the City; (2) the City Council's actions were \"arbitrary, irrational and\r\ncapricious\"; and (3) no one owning an interest in the waters and marshes of the Beaufort River had consented to the\r\nannexation of that property.\r\n\r\nA full merits hearing took place on June 7, 2000. (2)  On July 21, 2000, the trial court granted judgment to the defendants,\r\nholding (1) contiguity was not destroyed by the waters and marshlands separating the Trask property from the city limits;\r\n(2) Appellants lacked standing to attack the annexation ordinance; (3) Appellants nevertheless failed to meet their burden\r\nof proof to show that the City Council's actions were arbitrary, irrational, and capricious; and (4) the allegation that the\r\nState of South Carolina, as purported owner of the waters and marshlands annexed by the City, did not consent to the\r\nannexation was insufficient to invalidate the annexation petition.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Appellants first argue the trial court, in holding they \r\n  lacked standing to pursue their action, improperly discredited this court's \r\n  opinion in St. Andrews Public Service District v. City of Charleston \r\n  (3) as \"not yet final\" and being in conflict with two supreme court \r\n  decisions. (4) Notwithstanding the trial court's \r\n  remarks, we hold the present case is distinguishable from St. Andrews.\r\n\r\nSt. Andrews involved the dismissal of a lawsuit brought \r\n  by the St. Andrews Public Service District challenging two annexation ordinances \r\n  enacted by the City of Charleston. (5) The trial \r\n  court dismissed the action on the ground that, because the Public Service District \r\n  did not own real property in the area and had no proprietary interest or statutory \r\n  rights in the annexed area, it lacked standing to pursue the challenge. \r\n  (6) This court reversed, observing that \"the Charleston City Council \r\n  attempt[ed] to establish contiguity, not by merely crossing a roadway to annex \r\n  an adjacent property, but by annexing the length of a road to establish \r\n  a common boundary\" (7) and further noting that \r\n  \"[t]hat kind of annexation is not authorized by the laws of this state.\" \r\n  (8) Based on the supreme court's recognition that private individuals \r\n  have standing to attack a void annexation, that is, one not authorized by law, \r\n  (9) this court concluded the Public Service District, even though \r\n  without either proprietary interests or statutory rights in the annexed area, \r\n  had standing to challenge the validity of the annexation ordinances at issue. \r\n  In other words, if a municipality annexes property that is beyond its reach, \r\n  the annexation must fail as a matter of law, even when there was compliance \r\n  with the statutory requirements to effect the annexation. It follows, then, \r\n  that if an annexation is void as a matter of law, a plaintiff need not \"assert \r\n  an infringement of its own proprietary interests or statutory rights in order \r\n  to establish standing\" to challenge it. (10)\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Appellants appear to assert the annexation was void because of (1) a lack of contiguity, and (2) the failure of the\r\nowner of the intervening property to join in the annexation petition.  They further argue that, because of the absence of\r\nconsent from one of the purported owners of the annexed properties, the annexation is necessarily defective under the 100-per cent method and therefore must fail as a matter of law.  We find these arguments unavailing.\r\n\r\nAs to the alleged lack of contiguity, Appellants argue, \"The law authorizes the City to annex only contiguous territory, and\r\nsince the property purportedly annexed is not contiguous because the owner of the intervening property has not petitioned\r\nfor its annexation, the annexation is void.\"  We interpret this argument to mean that the requirement of contiguity was not\r\nmet because of the presence of the waters and marshes of the Beaufort River between the Trask property and the City.   We\r\nagree with the trial court, however, that the separation between the City and the Trask property by the waters and marshes\r\nof the Beaufort River did not destroy contiguity. (11)  \r\n\r\nAs to the failure of the owner of the intervening property to sign the annexation petition, Appellants argue the absence of\r\nconsent by the State of South Carolina, which owned the area of the Beaufort River annexed by the City, made the\r\nannexation void under the 100-per cent method. (12)  We agree with the trial court, however, that this challenge concerned\r\nonly the method of the annexation rather than the annexation itself.  The alleged defect went to only the issue of\r\ncompliance with the statutory requirements for annexation.  It would not preclude the City from annexing the property if\r\nthe required statutory procedures had been followed.  Appellants, then, have shown that the ordinance was merely voidable\r\nrather than void. (13)    \r\n\r\n2.  Appellants further contend that, because the County alleged infringement of its statutory rights and proprietary interests,\r\nit had standing to maintain this action.  We find no reversible error.\r\n\r\nThe trial court held that the County \"cannot show that there has been an infringement of its own proprietary interests or\r\nstatutory rights.\"  In so holding, the trial court focused on the proof adduced at the merits hearing of such an infringement\r\nrather than on the allegations in the complaint.  \r\n\r\nAssuming without deciding that the complaint contained allegations sufficient to give the County standing to challenge the\r\nannexation ordinance, we nevertheless hold there is ample authority to affirm the trial court's determination that the\r\nCounty's failure to prove these allegations at the merits hearing ultimately defeated its claim to standing. (14)  Moreover,\r\nAppellants have not argued in their brief that the trial court erred in finding they made an insufficient showing at the merits\r\nhearing that the County had standing to pursue this action. (15)\r\n\r\n3.  Gnann argues she has standing to pursue this action by virtue of the South Carolina Uniform Declaratory Judgments\r\nAct (16) and her status as a taxpayer.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn support of her argument, Gnann cites Sloan v. School \r\n  District of Greenville County (17) for the \r\n  proposition that to establish standing she need only demonstrate a justiciable \r\n  controversy. The presence of a justiciable controversy, however, does not by \r\n  itself give a litigant standing to sue. As the supreme court has stated, standing \r\n  requires \"a personal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit, i.e., one must \r\n  be a real party in interest.\" (18) With regard \r\n  to taxpayer standing, \"[t]he general rule is that a taxpayer may not maintain \r\n  a suit to enjoin the action of State officers when he has no special interest \r\n  and his only standing is the exceedingly small interest of a general taxpayer.\" \r\n  (19) Stated another way, absent a truly individual injury, Gnann, \r\n  as a taxpayer plaintiff, must demonstrate some overriding public purpose or \r\n  concern to confer standing to sue on behalf of her fellow taxpayers. \r\n  (20)\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Appellants argue only that Gnann had taxpayer \r\n  standing because of the allegations in the complaint that &quot;the actions \r\n  of the city in annexing the subject property are void and were done without \r\n  lawful authority&quot; and would therefore result in the expenditure of municipal \r\n  funds to provide services to the annexed territory. It would appear to us, then, \r\n  that Gnann has not alleged any injury unique to her as a taxpayer. Also, given \r\n  our determination that the annexation was voidable rather than void, we agree \r\n  with the trial court that Gnann failed to demonstrate an overriding public purpose \r\n  or concern that would give her taxpayer standing to challenge the annexation. \r\n  (21)\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J, and HOWARD, J., concur.\r\n1.

The prerequisites for challenging a municipal ordinance based on taxpayer standing has been generally described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]axpayers are not authorized to maintain \r\n    a suit to test the validity of an ordinance simply because they are taxpayers. \r\n    They must show that the effect of the ordinance will be to increase their \r\n    burden of taxation, to divert a fund from a purpose intended by law, or to \r\n    affect them differently from other citizens in a similar position.&nbsp; It \r\n    is not sufficient that they maintain the proceeding merely as a citizen to \r\n    protect abstract rights. Nor does mere difference in degree of interest of \r\n    one taxpayer from that of another in itself entitle the former to maintain \r\n    a suit to test the validity of the ordinance. A taxpayer, at large, of a municipality, \r\n    having no private interest in the question any more than other taxpayers, \r\n    cannot maintain a suit in equity, as against the public authorities, to set \r\n    aside or prevent illegal acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Eugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal \r\n  Corporations Â§ 20.19 (1998) (emphasis added). \r\n 21.

Bank and Atlantic filed \r\n  motions for summary judgment on all causes of action. The trial judge granted \r\n  the motions. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Appellants entered into an agreement with Robert \r\n  P. Chaplin, III, to purchase a piece of commercial property located in Hollywood, \r\n  South Carolina. The parties agreed upon a purchase price of $200,000, and Appellants \r\n  made no attempt to negotiate for a lower price.\r\n\r\nAfter agreeing to purchase the property, Appellants approached \r\n  Bank to obtain financing. Bank executed a commitment letter of intent to loan \r\n  Appellants the purchase money \"not to exceed $160,000.00 or 80% of the appraised \r\n  value, whichever is less,\" to be secured by the real estate. Bank then requested \r\n  that Atlantic prepare a written appraisal of the property. The appraisal showed \r\n  the market value of the property in November 1993 was $200,000. Both Robertson \r\n  and Brown testified they did not see the 1993 appraisal until 1998.\r\n\r\n Appellants executed a note and mortgage in favor of Bank \r\n  for the principal loan amount of $160,000.00. The mortgage provided that Appellants \r\n  would be responsible for paying off the balance of the debt in five years. At \r\n  the end of the mortgage period, a balloon payment was due and Bank again hired \r\n  Atlantic to appraise the property.\r\n\r\nG. Hammond Bamberg, III, performed the 1998 appraisal and \r\n  testified that in 1993, \"the building was in good condition and in the photographs \r\n  it was all painted up and nice looking and really did look good and apparently \r\n  it was a hundred percent occupied at the time.\" Bamberg testified that the Hollywood \r\n  rental market had declined since 1993. Moreover, Bamberg noted that \"paint was \r\n  peeling off\" the building, \"shrubs were growing through the compressor,\" and \r\n  the building \"appeared to be about half vacant.\" Atlantic found the 1998 fair \r\n  market value of the property was only $80,000. In Bamberg's opinion, the difference \r\n  in the appraised values resulted from the \"condition of the improvements\" to \r\n  the property and the lack of any documentation regarding the leases and the \r\n  income for the property.\r\n\r\nWhen the final $133,000 payment was due, Appellants defaulted, \r\n  and Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings. However, before the property could \r\n  be sold, Appellants filed a complaint against Bank alleging six causes of action \r\n  for: (1) fraud, (2) civil conspiracy, (3) breach of implied covenant of good \r\n  faith and fair dealing, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) breach of contract, \r\n  and (6) violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. Bank answered \r\n  and counterclaimed for foreclosure. Appellants later amended their complaint \r\n  to add Atlantic as a party defendant to the causes of action for civil conspiracy, \r\n  negligent misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices.\r\n\r\nBoth Bank and Atlantic filed motions for summary judgment. \r\n  At the summary judgment hearing, Appellants argued the discovery process was \r\n  not yet complete. They also produced an unsigned \"Appraisal Review\" document \r\n  dated July 26, 1999, prepared by Fred J. Attaway, Jr., as the opinion of an \r\n  expert witness questioning the 1993 appraisal performed by Atlantic. Appellants \r\n  requested the court to \"keep the record open\" so that they could provide the \r\n  court with a copy of Attaway's statement. Respondents objected to the introduction \r\n  of the document as being untimely presented. The trial judge excluded Attaway's \r\n  Appraisal Review and granted summary judgement on all of Appellants' causes \r\n  of action.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there \r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.\" Toomer v. Norfolk So. Ry. Co., 344 S.C. 486, 489, \r\n  544 S.E.2d 634, 635 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Rule 56(c) SCRCP. Summary \r\n  judgment is not appropriate, however, where further inquiry into the facts of \r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Carolina Alliance \r\n  for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, \r\n  337 S.C. 476, 484, 523 S.E.2d 795, 799 (Ct. App. 1999). In determining whether \r\n  any triable issue of fact exists as will preclude summary judgment, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most \r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation \r\n  Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998). If triable issues exist, \r\n  those issues must go to the jury. Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, \r\n  405, 409 S.E.2d 366, 367 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.   Ongoing \r\n    Discovery  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellants first argue that summary judgment was premature \r\n  because they did not have a chance to finish discovery. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAppellants' original complaint against Bank was filed on \r\n  January 25, 1999, and their amended complaint adding Atlantic as a defendant \r\n  was filed more than a year later on May 23, 2000. Bank answered the original \r\n  complaint in March 1999 and Atlantic answered the amended complaint in May 2000. \r\n  However, before Atlantic was added as a party, Charles Middleton, owner of Atlantic, \r\n  was deposed on December 21, 1999 and April 25, 2000. Atlantic did not file its \r\n  motion for summary judgment until August 1, 2000. \r\n\r\nUnder these facts, Bank and Atlantic were clearly authorized \r\n  under our rules of procedure to file their summary judgment motion. \"A party \r\n  seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim or to obtain a \r\n  declaratory judgment may, at any time after the expiration of 30 days \r\n  from the commencement of the action . . . move . . . for a summary \r\n  judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.\" Rule 56(a), SCRCP (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nIn this case, although Respondents' motions for summary \r\n  judgment were filed less than three months after Atlantic was made a party, \r\n  the motions were filed more than a year after Appellants initiated the action \r\n  and more than eight months after Middleton's initial deposition. We agree with \r\n  the trial court that any further depositions would not have assisted Appellants. \r\n  Generally, it is not premature for the trial court to grant summary judgment \r\n  after all relevant parties have been deposed because the litigants have had \r\n  a full and fair opportunity to develop the record in the case. See George \r\n  v. Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 344 S.C. 582, 594, 545 S.E.2d 500, \r\n  506 (2001) (finding summary judgment was not premature because defendant \"had \r\n  a full and fair opportunity to develop the record on this issue, but failed \r\n  to do so.\"); see also Bayle v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 344 S.C. \r\n  115, 128-29, 542 S.E.2d 736, 742-43 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating it was not error \r\n  to grant summary judgment because no further discovery would have contributed \r\n  to the resolution of the case).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it appears that Appellants did not protect \r\n  their interests regarding their notices to take the depositions of several bank \r\n  employees. Although these notices were sent before Respondents' motions, Appellants \r\n  did not request protection from the court. Rather, at the summary judgment hearing, \r\n  Appellants only asked that the trial judge hold the record open so that they \r\n  could supplement it with their purported expert's opinion. Moreover, the existence \r\n  of these notices does not make the motions for summary judgment premature. See \r\n  Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 118, 420 S.E.2d 495, 497 \r\n  (1992) (finding that summary judgement was not premature when the Degenharts \r\n  did not seek a continuance or ask the master-in-equity to hold his decision \r\n  in abeyance pending the outcome of their motion to compel discovery). Thus, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's finding that discovery was \r\n  complete for purposes of summary judgment. See Bayle, 344 S.C. at 128, \r\n  542 S.E.2d at 742 (\"The rulings of a trial judge in matters involving discovery \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nII.  Summary Judgment \r\n  on each Cause of Action\r\n\r\nAppellants next claim that the trial judge erred in granting \r\n  Bank's and Atlantic's motion for summary judgment on each cause of action. We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\nA. Fraud\r\n\r\nAppellants claim Bank and Atlantic committed fraud by pre-determining \r\n  the amount of the appraisal based on the amount Bank wanted to loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n  To establish fraud, a party must prove: (1) a representation; \r\n    (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity \r\n    or reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation \r\n    be acted upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's \r\n    reliance on its truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the \r\n    hearer's consequent and proximate injury. \r\n\r\n\r\nSorin Equip. Co., v. The Firm, Inc., 323 S.C. 359, \r\n  365-366, 474 S.E.2d 819, 823 (Ct. App. 1996). Failure to prove any element of \r\n  fraud is fatal to the action. Id. Furthermore, \"[f]raud cannot be presumed; \r\n  it must be proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.\" Foxfire Village, \r\n  Inc. v. Black &amp; Veatch, Inc., 304 S.C. 366, 374, 404 S.E.2d 912, 917 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\nHere, it is clear that Appellants have not established the \r\n  requisite elements for fraud. Appellants' lack of reliance is glaringly absent. \r\n  The purchase price for the commercial property was already agreed upon before \r\n  Appellants approached Bank for a loan. Significantly, Appellants did not receive \r\n  a copy of the 1993 appraisal until 1998. Even if they had received a copy of \r\n  this appraisal, both Robertson and Brown testified that they did not actually \r\n  rely on it in purchasing the property. Therefore, Appellants could not have \r\n  relied upon the appraisal in purchasing the property. Moreover, \"[t]here [can] \r\n  be no liability for casual statements, representations as to matters of law, \r\n  or matters which plaintiff could ascertain on his own in the exercise of due \r\n  diligence.\" West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 134, 533 S.E.2d 334, 337 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000) (citations and internal quotations omitted). Here, the price for \r\n  the property was not negotiated and Appellants made no effort to independently \r\n  ascertain its value before purchase. Because Appellants accepted the seller's \r\n  representation of the value of the property without question or confirmation \r\n  and have not presented any evidence that the property was not worth $200,000 \r\n  at the time of the 1993 appraisal, we find no evidence of fraud.\r\n\r\nB. Civil Conspiracy\r\n\r\nAppellants claim Bank and Atlantic conspired with each other \r\n  for the purpose of having them buy the property at an inflated value. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA civil conspiracy exists when there is (1) a combination \r\n  of two or more persons, (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which \r\n  causes the plaintiff special damage. Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, \r\n  292 S.C. 595, 600, 358 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct.App. 1987). \"Civil conspiracy is \r\n  an act which is by its very nature covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible \r\n  of proof by direct evidence. . . .\" Id., 292 S.C. at 601, 358 S.E.2d \r\n  at 153. Thus, \"[i]n order to establish a conspiracy, evidence, either direct \r\n  or circumstantial, must be produced from which a party may reasonably infer \r\n  the joint assent of the minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the \r\n  unlawful enterprise.\" First Union Nat'l Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, \r\n  333 S.C. 554, 575, 511 S.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct.App. 1998).\r\n\r\nHere, Atlantic was employed by Bank and acting as the agent \r\n  of only Bank. Bank retained Atlantic merely to appraise the property in 1993 \r\n  and 1998. Significantly, Atlantic's appraiser testified that he was never told \r\n  why the property was being appraised in the first place. Similarly, a loan officer \r\n  at Bank testified that it was Bank's practice to appraise properties when new \r\n  or re-financed loans were contemplated. Thus, because Appellants' have not presented \r\n  any evidence of a concerted effort by Bank and Atlantic to harm Appellants, \r\n  we find no proof of civil conspiracy.\r\n\r\nC. Negligent Misrepresentation\r\n\r\nAppellants next assert they were the victims of a negligent \r\n  misrepresentation resulting from the 1993 appraisal. In a claim for negligent \r\n  misrepresentation, a plaintiff must prove that:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; \r\n    (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the statement; (3) the \r\n    defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information \r\n    to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise \r\n    due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and \r\n    (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his \r\n    reliance upon the representation. \r\n\r\n\r\ndeBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, \r\n  266-67, 536 S.E.2d 399, 405 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted). For purposes \r\n  of proving negligent misrepresentation, evidence that a statement was made in \r\n  the course of the defendant's business, profession, or employment is sufficient \r\n  to prove the defendant's pecuniary interest in making the statement, even if \r\n  the defendant received no consideration for it. AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger, \r\n  309 S.C. 213, 223, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App.1992).\r\n\r\nAppellants' negligent misrepresentation claim fails because \r\n  they have failed to prove reliance on the 1993 appraisal. It is undisputed that \r\n  the parties agreed to a contract price without seeing an appraisal. Additionally, \r\n  Atlantic was employed by and acting as an agent for Bank; thus, it had no independent \r\n  duty to Appellants. Furthermore, we do not read Bank's commitment letter written \r\n  before the appraisal was made as anything other than a promise to finance up \r\n  to $160,000. Had the property been appraised at a value of $80,000 in 1993, \r\n  then bank was committed to loaning no more than 80% of the market value, or \r\n  $64,000.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is no evidence that the subject property \r\n  was worth less than $200,000 in 1993. At that time, the property was in good \r\n  repair and fully occupied. Unfortunately, the property did not retain its value. \r\n  Bamberg testified that the property appeared to be in a very different state \r\n  of repair and occupancy in 1998. We find no evidence in the record to refute \r\n  this testimony and thus find no evidence of negligent misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nD. South Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices \r\n  Act\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), \r\n  (1) unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or \r\n  practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are deemed unlawful. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20 (1985). A plaintiff bringing a private cause of action under \r\n  the UTPA must allege and prove the defendant's actions adversely affected the \r\n  public interest. Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, \r\n  473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996). \"Therefore, conduct which only affects the parties \r\n  to the transaction provides no basis for a UTPA claim.\" Jefferies v. Phillips, \r\n  316 S.C. 523, 527, 451 S.E.2d 21, 23 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found that \"there is no evidence of an act \r\n  or practice that is unfair or one that affects the public interest.\" We agree. \r\n  Bank loans money based on the appraised value of the secured property. In its \r\n  commitment letter, Bank limited the promised loan amount to Appellants as \"not \r\n  to exceed $160,000 or 80% of the appraised value, whichever is less.\" Bank then \r\n  had the property appraised for its own benefit. Had the property been appraised \r\n  for less than $200,000, Bank would have adjusted the loan amount accordingly. \r\n  We find nothing in the record, other than Appellants' unproven allegations and \r\n  inferences of impropriety and coincidences, to suggest that Bank deliberately \r\n  set out to loan Appellants $160,000 secured by insufficient collateral. Additionally, \r\n  we can think of no logical reason why Bank would make it a practice to intentionally \r\n  make loans for an amount in excess of the collateral's value and risk substantial \r\n  losses in the event of default. Therefore, summary judgment on this issue was \r\n  proper.  (2)\r\n\r\nIII.    Supplementing the Record  \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Appellants argue they should be able to supplement the record with the opinion of their\r\nexpert, Fred J. Attaway, Jr., regarding the propriety of the 1993 appraisal.  They claim his opinion\r\nwould prove \"that fraud is in the appraisal itself\" and present an issue of fact warranting the \r\ncontinuation of this action beyond summary judgment.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nOur rules of civil procedure required Appellants to present \r\n  admissible evidence to the trial judge in the form of affidavits or other \"pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file.\" Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP. \"Affidavits are the principal means of bringing information before the \r\n  court in a motion for summary judgment.\" James F. Flanagan, South Carolina \r\n  Civil Procedure 454 (2nd ed. 1996). Such \"[s]upporting and opposing affidavits \r\n  shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be \r\n  admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent \r\n  to testify to the matters stated therein.\" Rule 56(e), SCRCP. Moreover, the \r\n  party opposing the motion for summary judgment \"may serve opposing affidavits \r\n  not later than two days before the hearing.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, Attaway's opinion was in the form of a three page unsigned statement dated July 26, 1999. \r\nTo be admissible, Attaway's opinion should have been signed and submitted at least two days\r\nbefore the hearing.  Attaway's \"Appraisal Review\" failed to conform in both respects and thus\r\nwas properly excluded.\r\n\r\nMoreover, after reviewing Attaway's \"Appraisal Review\" we \r\n  are unable to discern if he is familiar with the the 1993 appraisal or if he \r\n  applied or is familiar with the Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. \r\n  See Englert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 303, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  871, 873 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding affidavit inadmissible because it failed to \r\n  assert that the affiant knew or believed the materials were defective, or assert \r\n  the basis for any such belief or knowledge). The only indication of Attaway's \r\n  expertise is in the suffixes \"MAI\" and \"SRA\" following his name and identifying \r\n  him as the reviewer of the prior appraisal.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the final order of the trial judge is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10 through \r\n  -350 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2001). \r\n2. Appellants also assert that Bank failed \r\n  to follow its own procedures established for its loan transactions. For example, \r\n  Appellants state that Bank committed to a loan before having an appraisal of \r\n  the property done and that Bank apparently never collected the 1993 appraisal \r\n  fee from Appellants. Nonetheless, even if such violations did occur, we fail \r\n  to see how they assist Appellants' position. These alleged violations would \r\n  only cause harm to Bank, for it could find itself potentially obligated on a \r\n  loan it would not otherwise make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3492","title":"Smtih v.

Smith brought this declaratory judgment action seeking reformation \r\nof an insurance policy issued to Roosevelt Ladson, alleging the insurer failed \r\nto make a new offer of underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage when a second vehicle \r\nwas added to the policy. The Circuit Court denied the request for reformation, \r\nfinding an insurer is not required to make a new offer of UIM coverage when an \r\ninsured adds additional vehicles to an existing policy. We affirm. \r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis action arises out of an automobile accident in which \r\n  Smith was injured while riding as a passenger in a Hyundai owned and driven \r\n  by Ladson. Smith is seeking to reform Ladson's automobile insurance policy so \r\n  as to include UIM coverage for the accident.\r\n\r\nLadson was covered under an automobile insurance policy \r\n  issued by the respondent, South Carolina Insurance Company (\"SCIC\"). He initially \r\n  obtained a one-year policy for coverage on a 1990 Geo Metro for the period May \r\n  7, 1999 to May 7, 2000. The policy liability limits were 15/30/10. \r\n  (1) On the day of his application, Ladson signed a form declining \r\n  UIM coverage. The parties have stipulated the form was approved by the South \r\n  Carolina Department of Insurance for use in offering optional coverages (such \r\n  as UIM), which insurers were required to offer under South Carolina law. On \r\n  February 9, 2000, Ladson added a second vehicle to his policy, a 1994 Hyundai. \r\n  It is undisputed that SCIC did not make a second offer of UIM coverage to Ladson \r\n  when the Hyundai was added to the policy. \r\n\r\nOn February 17, 2000, Smith was injured while riding as \r\n  a passenger in the Hyundai driven by Ladson. Smith settled his claim against \r\n  Ladson for the policy's liability limit of $15,000 and executed a covenant allowing \r\n  him to pursue any available UIM coverage. \r\n\r\nSmith brought this declaratory judgment action against SCIC \r\n  seeking reformation of the policy issued to Ladson so as to include UIM coverage \r\n  because SCIC did not make a new offer of UIM coverage when Ladson added the \r\n  Hyundai. Both parties moved for summary judgment. \r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court granted SCIC's motion for summary judgment \r\n  and ruled SCIC was not required to make a new offer of UIM coverage when Ladson \r\n  added the second vehicle to his policy, relying upon Â§ 38-77-350(C) of the South \r\n  Carolina Code. Smith appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP; see also Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d \r\n  187 (1997). In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence \r\n  and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the party opposing summary judgment. Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. \r\n  36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a question of first impression in South Carolina, Smith \r\n  contends the Circuit Court erred in finding an insurer is not required to make \r\n  a new offer of UIM coverage when an insured adds an additional vehicle to an \r\n  existing automobile insurance policy. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-160 states automobile insurance carriers \"shall \r\n  â€¦ offer, at the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to \r\n  the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event \r\n  that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault \r\n  insured or underinsured motorist.\" This statute mandates that \"underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage in any amount up to the insured's liability coverage must \r\n  be offered to a policyholder.\" Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. \r\n  149, 154, 311 S.E.2d 723, 726 (1984) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court has held that \"it is clear from the language \r\n  of the statute that the burden is on the insurer to effectively transmit the \r\n  offer to the insured.\" State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987). In Wannamaker, the Court held \r\n  \"the statute mandates the insured to be provided with adequate information, \r\n  and in such a manner, as to allow the insured to make an intelligent decision \r\n  of whether to accept or reject coverage.\" Id. The Supreme Court expressly \r\n  adopted a four-part test to determine whether an insurer has complied with its \r\n  duty to offer the optional coverage:\r\n\r\n\r\n  the insurer's notification process must be commercially \r\n    reasonable, whether oral or in writing; \r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  \r\n  the insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage \r\n    and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms;\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  \r\n  the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the \r\n    nature of the optional coverage; and \r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  \r\n  the insured must be told that optional coverages are \r\n    available for an additional premium.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\n\"If the insurer fails to comply with this duty, the policy \r\n  will be reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM coverage up to the limits \r\n  of liability insurance carried by the insured.\" Rabb v. Catawba Ins. Co., \r\n  339 S.C. 228, 232, 528 S.E.2d 693, 694-95 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. denied. \r\n  Apparently in response to Wannamaker, the legislature enacted Â§ 38-77-350 of \r\n  the South Carolina Code. Id. at 232, 528 S.E.2d at 695.\r\n\r\nThis appeal involves an interpretation of subsection (C) \r\n  of Â§ 38-77-350, which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  An automobile insurer is not required to make a new offer \r\n    of coverage on any automobile insurance policy which renews, extends, changes, \r\n    supersedes, or replaces an existing policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court found that a new UIM offer was not required \r\n  and granted summary judgment to SCIC, noting \"[s]ubsection (C) [of Â§ 38-77-350] \r\n  provides that the insurer need not make a new offer at renewal, provided that \r\n  one such offer has been made in connection with an existing policy. There is \r\n  no mention of making offers for each vehicle on the policy or making additional \r\n  offers when vehicles are added to the policy.\" \r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court further noted the form on which Ladson \r\n  was offered UIM coverage when he initially obtained his insurance policy contained \r\n  the following notice:\r\n\r\n\r\n  You will not be presented with another copy of this Form \r\n    by your insurance agent or your current insurance company when you extend, \r\n    change, supersede, or replace your automobile liability insurance policy. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is that we \r\n  are to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the legislature.\" Burns \r\n  v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 \r\n  (1989) (citations omitted). &quot;[W]ords used therein must be given their plain \r\n  and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit \r\n  or expand its operation.\" Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 \r\n  S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992) (citations omitted). \"The language \r\n  must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords \r\n  with its general purpose.\" Id. (citations omitted). This Court's primary \r\n  function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General \r\n  Assembly. A statute must receive a practical and reasonable interpretation consistent \r\n  with the \"design\" of the legislature.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Smith cites McDonald v. South Carolina Farm \r\n  Bureau Insurance Company, 336 S.C. 120, 518 S.E.2d 624 (Ct. App. 1999), \r\n  in which we held that an insurer should have offered UIM coverage to McDonald \r\n  when he bought his mother's car and the insurer substituted his name for hers \r\n  on the automobile insurance policy. We rejected the insurer's argument that, \r\n  under Â§ 38-77-350(C), it was not required to offer McDonald UIM coverage because \r\n  the insurance policy merely substituted his name for his mother's as the named \r\n  insured on the policy.\r\n\r\nWe find McDonald inapposite because in that case, \r\n  McDonald had never been a named insured with Farm Bureau or was given the opportunity \r\n  to accept or reject UIM coverage. When McDonald became the named insured on \r\n  the policy, it altered the legal relationship of the parties. As we observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where Section 38-77-350(C) states the insured is not required \r\n    to make a \"new\" offer, it clearly envisions the circumstances where the insurer \r\n    has already made an \"old\" offer.\r\n\r\n  We find this reasoning applicable to the present case. Removing \r\n    [the mother] from the policy and substituting McDonald as the named insured \r\n    was not a mere policy change. It was the creation of a new insurance policy \r\n    with a new named insured. Before McDonald became the named insured, he had \r\n    never been given the opportunity to accept or reject UIM coverage. Therefore, \r\n    an offer of UIM coverage to McDonald was required under Section 38-77-160.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 125, 518 S.E.2d at 626 (citing Ackerman \r\n  v. Travelers Indem. Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1995)).\r\n\r\nIn this case, our legislature has not defined the circumstances \r\n  constituting a \"change\" in coverage, but the plain language of section 38-77-350(C) \r\n  leads us to the ineluctable conclusion that the addition of extra vehicles to \r\n  an existing insurance policy does not  require an additional \r\n  offer of UIM coverage where the insurer has previously made a proper offer to \r\n  the insured.\r\n\r\nOther Jurisdictions\r\n\r\nWe are aware of some divergence of opinion in other jurisdictions \r\n  considering this issue. Compare Makela v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \r\n  497 N.E.2d 483 (Ill. App. Ct. 1986) (holding, in a case involving a multiple-vehicle \r\n  policy, that a new offer of uninsured motorist coverage was not required for \r\n  the addition of a new vehicle, which was comparable to the renewal or supplementation \r\n  of an existing policy, events that did not trigger the statutory requirement \r\n  of a new offer; the court's holding was based, in part, upon the principle that \r\n  an insurance contract is personal to the insured because it insures the risk \r\n  of loss to the insured and does not attach to specific vehicles); Pierce \r\n  v. Allstate Ins. Co., 848 P.2d 1197, 1200-01 (Or. 1993) (en banc) (concluding \r\n  that, although an insurer by statute must offer uninsured coverage when it initially \r\n  issues a policy, it need not make another offer when an insured adds, deletes, \r\n  or replaces vehicles, the court noting that \"once an insured has been made aware \r\n  that the coverage is available, an insurer is not obligated â€¦ to inquire continuously \r\n  whether the insured really meant to refuse\") (quoting White v. Safeco Ins. \r\n  Co. of Am., 680 P.2d 700 (Or. Ct. App. 1984)); El-Habr v. Mountain States \r\n  Mut. Cas. Co., 626 S.W.2d 171, 172 (Tex. Ct. App. 1981) (holding an endorsement \r\n  to an existing insurance policy which added a new vehicle \"did not create a \r\n  new contract of insurance, but was merged with and became a part of the original \r\n  policy\"), with Withrow v. Pickard, 905 P.2d 800 (Okla. 1995) (noting \r\n  the addition of a vehicle constitutes a new policy distinct from the original \r\n  which requires that uninsured coverage be offered in conjunction with the new \r\n  vehicle); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kaneshiro, 998 P.2d 490 (Hawaii 2000) \r\n  (concluding a new offer of optional UM/UIM coverage was required where a party \r\n  was substituted for the named insured and a vehicle was added to the policy \r\n  as they constituted material changes to the existing policy).\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold the addition of a new vehicle is a \"change\" to an \r\n  existing policy as contemplated by Â§ 38-77-350(C) and thus a new offer of UIM \r\n  coverage is not mandated. We rule that an insurer is not \r\n  required to make a new offer of UIM coverage when an insured adds an additional \r\n  vehicle to an existing automobile insurance policy. Reformation of the insurance \r\n  policy was not required in this case based on the plain language of Â§ 38-77-350(C). \r\n  Any limitation in the scope of the statute's application is a matter best left \r\n  for the consideration of our legislature.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., and THOMAS, Acting Judge, concur.  \r\n1.

It also sought damages for lost rent caused by their removal. \r\n  The master-in-equity found that the pews and ceiling fans/lights were fixtures \r\n  and granted Carjow its requested relief. Rev. John Simmons, the former pastor, \r\n  appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1987, New Hope purchased a church building at 5801 \r\n  Robinson Street in Hanahan, South Carolina. The First Federal Savings &amp; \r\n  Loan Association of Charleston (Bank) financed the purchase. Rev. Simmons testified \r\n  that the pews were obtained in a separate transaction. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Hurricane Hugo damaged the church. At that time, \r\n  the pews were unfastened from the floor and moved around the room to avoid water \r\n  drips and allow for repairs to the ceiling. (2) \r\n  Rev. Simmons testified that they moved the pews to avoid leaks \"[e]very time \r\n  it rained\" but \"when we put it back down, we put it back down like we took it \r\n  up\" and the intention was that the pews would eventually be reattached.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, the Bank began foreclosure proceedings on the property. \r\n  Frances B. Kerr appraised the property for the Bank. He made drawings and took \r\n  pictures showing the pews and ceiling fans/lights inside the sanctuary. Kerr \r\n  testified he did not check to see if the pews were fastened to the floor; however, \r\n  he testified that his appraisal included the pews and ceiling fans/lights. \r\n  (3) Walter Carr, a member of Carjow, testified he inspected the outside \r\n  of the property but acknowledged that he did not go inside. Instead, he received \r\n  some of the appraisal documents including the pictures of the church's interior.\r\n\r\nAfter being told by the Bank to vacate the premises, Rev. \r\n  Simmons removed the pews and the ceiling fans/lights. Since then, he has stored \r\n  the pews at his new church and the ceiling fans/lights at his house. On May \r\n  8, 1999, Carjow purchased the Church for $125,001.00. When Carr entered the \r\n  church premises, he observed that the pews and ceiling fans/lights were missing.\r\n\r\nCarr demanded Rev. Simmons return the pews and ceiling fans/lights.\r\nRev. Simmons testified\r\nCarr offered $2,500 for the return of the pews, and Rev. Simmons countered with an offer of\r\n$3,500 which was refused. On September 1, 1999, Carjow rented the premises to the Church on\r\nthe Rock. However, because the facility had no pews or ceiling fans, Carjow and its tenant reached\r\na subsequent agreement reducing the rent by $366 per month \"until such time as those items are\r\nrecovered.\" When the pews were not returned, Carjow initiated this action.\r\n\r\nThe matter was referred to the master by consent of the parties.  At the hearing, Carr presented\r\nevidence that the replacement cost of the pews was $27,438.45 and the replacement cost of\r\ncomparable ceiling fans/lights was $154.71 each, excluding $50 per fixture for installation.  The\r\nmaster found that the pews and the ceiling fans/lights were fixtures of the church and ordered Rev.\r\nSimmons to return them and that Carjow be awarded $5,490.00 for lost rent and $400.00 for the\r\ncost of reinstalling the ceiling fans/lights.  He further provided if Rev. Simmons refused to return\r\nthe fixtures, Carjow would be granted an additional $21,000.00 for the replacement cost of the\r\nfixtures.  Rev. Simmons appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Fixtures\r\n\r\nRev. Simmons argues that the pews and the ceiling fans/lights removed from the property were\r\nnot fixtures.  In this case, we disagree.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a particular action sounds in law \r\n  or equity, this court must discern the main purpose of the action, generally \r\n  from the body of the complaint. Ins. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. S.C. Ins. Co., \r\n  271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318 (1978); see Jean Hoefer Toal, \r\n  Shahin Vafai &amp; Robert A. Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina \r\n  188 (1999). Based on our reading of the complaint, we find this action's main \r\n  purpose is to recover the pews or their equivalent value plus any other damages \r\n  caused by Rev. Simmons's detention of the property. Therefore, we believe this \r\n  action is appropriately analyzed as a conversion action seeking damages. See \r\n  Oxford Fin. Cos. v. Burgess, 303 S.C. 534, 539, 402 S.E.2d 480, 482 (1991) \r\n  (\"A claim for conversion can be based on an unauthorized detention of property, \r\n  after demand.\"). \"An action for damages for conversion is an action at law.\" \r\n  Blackwell v. Blackwell, 289 S.C. 470, 471, 346 S.E.2d 731, 732 (Ct. App. \r\n  1986). As such, we must affirm the master's order if any evidence reasonably \r\n  supports his factual findings. Id.; accord Townes Assocs. v. \r\n  City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (\"In an \r\n  action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact \r\n  of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence \r\n  which reasonably supports the judge's findings.\").\r\n\r\nThe determination whether or not an item is a fixture is \r\n  a mixed question of law and fact. Carson v. Living Word Outreach Ministries, \r\n  Inc., 315 S.C. 64, 70, 431 S.E.2d 615, 618 (Ct. App. 1993). \"It is incumbent \r\n  on the court to define a fixture, but whether it is such in a particular instance \r\n  depends upon the facts of that case, unless the facts are susceptible of but \r\n  one inference.\" Id. South Carolina courts have defined a fixture as \" \r\n  an article which was a chattel, but by being physically annexed to the realty \r\n  by one having an interest in the soil becomes a part and parcel of it.\" Id. \r\n   Mere affixation does not automatically render property a fixture. Creative \r\n  Displays, Inc. v. S.C. Highway Dep't, 272 S.C. 68, 72, 248 S.E.2d 916, 917 \r\n  (1978). We find the converse is also true- severance of an item for some temporary \r\n  purpose will not change its character from a fixture back to personal property. \r\n  See 35A Am. Jur. 2d Fixtures Â§ 110 (2001). In determining whether \r\n  an item is a fixture, courts should consider the following factors: \"(1) mode \r\n  of attachment, (2) character of the structure or article, (3) the intent of \r\n  the parties making the annexation, and (4) the relationship of the parties.\" \r\n  Hyman v. Wellman Enters., 337 S.C. 80, 84, 522 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).\r\n\r\nThe master, citing Carson, applied the correct definition \r\n  and test for determining whether an item is a fixture. Accordingly, even if \r\n  this court might have reached a different result based on its view of the evidence, \r\n  we must affirm if there is any evidence supporting his factual determination \r\n  that this test was met. Mode of attachment, character of the property, and relationship \r\n  of the parties are not disputed. Therefore, our analysis hinges on the intent \r\n  of the parties.\r\n\r\n With respect to the ceiling fans/lights, these items were \r\n  attached to the property at the time of the sale and were necessary for the \r\n  comfort of the building's occupants. The record reflects an assumption by the \r\n  purchaser and the appraiser that these items would stay in place after the sale. \r\n  Therefore, we find that the evidence supports the master's determination that \r\n  these items were fixtures. See Equibank v. United States, 749 F.2d 1176, \r\n  1180 (5th Cir. 1985) (\"[A] lamp which is simply plugged into a socket \r\n  is a [sic] movable and may be removed from a residence without violating the \r\n  mortgage, but an installed light fixture, be it an expensive, antique chandelier \r\n  or a garden-variety fixture, becomes a component part of the building.\").\r\n\r\nRegarding the pews, we decline to hold that this type of \r\n  property is a fixture as a matter of law. Instead, we look to the facts of this \r\n  case. It is undisputed that the pews were physically attached to the church \r\n  building when New Hope bought the property. Moreover, the only reason the pews \r\n  were detached from the floor was because of hurricane damage, and Rev. Simmons \r\n  testified that the intention was always that they would reattach the pews. Carr \r\n  testified that the pew locations were clearly marked by the portions of the \r\n  sanctuary floor that were not faded by sunlight and that some holes and brackets \r\n  still marred the floor.\r\n\r\nWe find the analysis of Sims v. Williams, 441 S.W.2d \r\n  385 (Mo. Ct. App. 1969) persuasive here. In Sims, the trustees of a church \r\n  sought to recover eighteen church pews which were removed from the property. \r\n  The respondent, who purchased the church building in a foreclosure sale, claimed \r\n  the pews as fixtures. The trial court agreed and the appellate court affirmed, \r\n  finding the clear intention was that the pews became a part of the church property. \r\n  \"They were built for this church and installed therein to be a part of and complete \r\n  the church. They were bolted to the floor in such manner that their removal \r\n  damaged the floor of the building.\" Id.  at 387.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, we find there is evidence supporting \r\n  the trial court's ruling that the pews were fixtures and affirm.\r\n\r\nII. Damages for Lost Rental Income\r\n\r\nRev. Simmons next argues Carjow is not entitled to damages \r\n  for loss of rental income caused by the removal of the pews because the purported \r\n  loss was based on a negotiated agreement and \"speculative at best.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\nActual damages are awarded to compensate for proven injury \r\n  or loss. Black's Law Dictionary 394 (7th ed. 1999). Here, Carr testified he \r\n  was leasing the church building to the Church of the Rock. He testified that \r\n  the monthly rent of the facility with ceiling fans/lights and the pews would \r\n  be $1,592.00. Without these fixtures, however, Carr testified the property only \r\n  rented for $1,226.00 per month. Rev. Simmons did not present evidence that these \r\n  values were inaccurate.\r\n\r\nAs a property owner, Carr was competent to give his opinion \r\n  as to the property's rental value and his damages. See Seaboard Coast Line \r\n  R.R. v. Harrelson, 262 S.C. 43, 46, 202 S.E.2d 4, 5 (1974) (\"[A] landowner, \r\n  who is familiar with his property and its value, is allowed to give his estimate \r\n  as to the value of the land and damages thereto, even though he is not an expert.\"). \r\n  Here, the master accepted Carr's estimate regarding his damages for lost rent. \r\n  We give deference to the master's factual findings because he had a better vantage \r\n  point from which to judge the witnesses' credibility. See McDuffie v. O'Neal, \r\n  324 S.C. 297, 306, 476 S.E.2d 702, 706 (Ct. App. 1996). \"[T]he conclusions of \r\n  the master who observed the demeanor and appearance of the witnesses have peculiar \r\n  value on questions of credibility of witnesses.\" Patterson v. Goldsmith, \r\n  292 S.C. 619, 626, 358 S.E.2d 163, 167 (Ct. App. 1987). Accordingly, we affirm \r\n  the master's award as an appropriate measure of Carjow's damages for lost rent.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Rev. Simmons testified he installed \r\n  an air conditioning unit in the church before the sale, and, in exchange, the \r\n  prior owner of the church property agreed not to remove the pews which were \r\n  attached to the floor with \"L\" brackets. \r\n2. Photographs in the record of the empty \r\n  sanctuary show markings on the floor including holes and some brackets where \r\n  the pews had been. \r\n3.

The single commissioner found Lee was entitled to \r\n  an award for partial loss to his psychological system and continued treatment \r\n  for irritable bowel syndrome. The full commission reversed, and the circuit \r\n  court affirmed the full commission's decision. Lee appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nLee was injured on July 20, 1992, when a golf cart he was \r\n  on went over a seawall at Harbour Town in Hilton Head Island. Lee did not know \r\n  how to swim and was afraid he would drown. While clinging to a rope to prevent \r\n  himself from falling in the water, Lee was struck by the golf cart and received \r\n  several minor physical injuries.\r\n\r\nLee was treated for his minor injuries and released with \r\n  no findings of permanent impairment. He was paid fourteen weeks of temporary \r\n  total benefits for the time during which he was unable to work. After a hearing \r\n  in October 1996, the single commissioner determined Lee had reached maximum \r\n  medical improvement (\"MMI\") for his physical injuries by November 17, 1992. \r\n  However, the commissioner concluded Lee was entitled to further treatment and \r\n  evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. \r\n  Employer was ordered to provide this treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen Lee's treating physicians again placed him at MMI, \r\n  Employer requested a hearing. On December 3, 1998, the single commissioner conducted \r\n  a hearing to determine whether Lee had any permanent partial disability. In \r\n  her subsequent order, the single commissioner awarded Lee twenty-five weeks \r\n  of permanent partial disability for a partial loss of his \"psychological system,\" \r\n  treating it as a scheduled member of the body, as well as ten weeks for partial \r\n  loss of use of his rectum due to the irritable bowel syndrome. The single commissioner \r\n  found that Lee had reached MMI with respect to both his post-traumatic stress \r\n  disorder and his irritable bowel syndrome on May 25, 1998 and that Employer \r\n  was not responsible for any medical treatment after that date. However, with \r\n  regard to the irritable bowel syndrome, Employer was ordered to provide medication \r\n  necessary to maintain Lee at his current plateau.\r\n\r\nEmployer timely appealed this order to the full commission. \r\n  The full commission reversed the decision of the single commissioner. \r\n  (2) Lee appealed the full commission's order to the circuit court. \r\n  The circuit court affirmed the decision of the full commission. &nbsp;Lee's \r\n  subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied. &nbsp;Lee appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard \r\n  of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission. \r\n  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Any \r\n  review of the full commission's factual findings is governed by the substantial \r\n  evidence standard. Smith v. Squires Timber Co., 311 S.C. 321, 325, 428 \r\n  S.E.2d 878, 880 (1993). The \"possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions \r\n  from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being \r\n  supported by substantial evidence.\" Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. \r\n  Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). Substantial \r\n  evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached. Miller \r\n  v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 454, 441 S.E.2d 323, 324-25 (1994).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe full commission reversed the single commissioner's award \r\n  of damages for injuries to his psychological system, and the circuit court affirmed \r\n  this decision. Lee asserts this was error. We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, an injured employee may proceed under either \r\n  the general disability sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20 or under the scheduled member \r\n  section 42-9-30 in order to maximize recovery under the South Carolina Workers' \r\n  Compensation Act. See Brown v. Owen Steel Co., 316 S.C. 278, 280, \r\n  450 S.E.2d 57, 58 (Ct. App. 1994) (proceeding under the general disability sections \r\n  for an injury to a scheduled member gives the claimant \"the opportunity to establish \r\n  a disability greater than the presumptive disability provided for under the \r\n  scheduled member section.\"). Only where a scheduled loss is not accompanied \r\n  by additional complications affecting another part of the body is the scheduled \r\n  recovery exclusive. Id. (citing Singleton v. Young Lumber Co., \r\n  236 S.C. 454, 471, 114 S.E.2d 837, 845 (1960)).\r\n\r\nIn the current case, Lee does not assert his injury is compensable \r\n  under sections 42-9-10 or 42-9-20 (3). Instead, \r\n  he asserts that the injury to his psychological system is compensable as an \r\n  injury to a scheduled member. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1985 &amp; \r\n  Supp. 2001); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-1101 (1990 &amp; Supp 2001).\r\n\r\nSection 42-9-30 provides specific recoveries for total or \r\n  partial physical losses and impairments suffered by an employee to certain scheduled \r\n  members including: thumbs, fingers, toes, hands, arms, feet, legs, eyes, and \r\n  ears. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2001). This section further \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nFor the total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, a member, \r\n  organ or part of the body not covered herein . . . [t]he Commission shall \r\n  by regulations prescribe the ratio which the partial loss or loss or partial \r\n  loss of use of a particular member, organ or body part bears to the whole man, \r\n  basing such ratios on accepted medical standards and such ratios shall determine \r\n  the benefits payable under this subsection.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nRegulation 67-1101 provides additional examples of compensable \r\n  scheduled members. It states that \r\n\r\n[t]his schedule of organs, members, and bodily parts lists \r\n  prominent parts of the anatomy subject to occupational injury and is not \r\n  complete. The value of an organ, member, or bodily part not included may \r\n  be determined in accordance with the American Medical Association's \"Guide to \r\n  the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\", or any other accepted medical treatise \r\n  or authority. Compensation shall be payable for a total loss, permanent partial \r\n  loss, or loss of use of a member, organ, or part of the body when compensation \r\n  is not otherwise payable.\r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-1101 (1990 &amp; Supp 2001) \r\n  (emphasis added). The regulation further states it \"does not include injury \r\n  to the many bodily systems, organs, members, and anatomical parts\" which may \r\n  be independently recoverable under sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20. Id. \r\n  Nowhere is the psychological system listed as a scheduled member.\r\n\r\nLee asserts that the psychological system is a scheduled \r\n  member by reference to the American Medical Association's \"Guide to the Evaluation \r\n  of Permanent Impairment,\" the medical treatise identified in regulation 67-1101. \r\n  We agree with the circuit court and full commission that Lee's psychological \r\n  system is not a scheduled member.\r\n\r\nWhile we do not question that the \"Guide to the Evaluation \r\n  of Permanent Impairment\" identifies a mental injury as a legitimate medical \r\n  ailment, we are unpersuaded that a purely intangible injury such as one to the \r\n  psychological system was intended by the legislature to be classified as a scheduled \r\n  member compensable under section 42-9-30. The list of scheduled members in the \r\n  statute and accompanying regulation include only tangible and physically identifiable \r\n  organs, members, or other parts of the human body. Furthermore, our supreme \r\n  court has already determined that a psychological impairment is not compensable \r\n  under section 42-9-30. Fields v. Owens Corning Fiberglass, 301 S.C. 554, \r\n  393 S.E.2d 172 (1990). Consequently, the circuit court was correct in affirming \r\n  the full commission's conclusion that Lee was not entitled to compensation for \r\n  a psychological impairment under section 42-9-30. Id. at 556, 393 S.E.2d \r\n  at 174.\r\n\r\nLee maintains that Fields is not controlling because \r\n  regulation 67-1101 \"now clearly states that it is not an exclusive and \r\n  complete list of body parts, members, and organs for which impairment awards \r\n  may be granted.\" However, the regulation concerning scheduled \r\n  losses stated it was not an exclusive list at the time Fields was decided. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-35 (1989) (stating that \"[t]his schedule \r\n  . . . is not complete . . . ; and the value of any organ, member, or bodily \r\n  parts not included in this schedule will be determined in accordance with The \r\n  American Medical Association's 'Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment' \r\n  and any other relevant medical authority\"). Lee also asserts that \"recent appellate \r\n  decisions demonstrate an increased recognition of psychological injuries.\" In \r\n  support of his argument, Lee cites Stokes v. First National Bank, 306 \r\n  S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1991), Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas \r\n  Corp., 335 S.C. 77, 80, 515 S.E.2d 104, 105-106 (Ct. App. 1999), and Estridge \r\n  v. Joslyn Clark Controls, 325 S.C. 532, 482 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  Although these cases would allow compensation for psychological or mental injury \r\n  in a disability setting, none of these cases support an award of compensation \r\n  for such an injury as a scheduled loss pursuant to section 42-9-30.\r\n\r\nWe conclude Lee's psychological system is not a scheduled \r\n  member and substantial evidence supports the conclusions of the full commission. \r\n   (4)\r\n\r\nLee also argues he should continue to receive medications \r\n  and medical treatment to maintain his plateau of recovery beyond the date of \r\n  MMI on May 25, 1998. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe burden is upon a claimant to prove such facts as will \r\n  render his injury compensable within the provisions of the Worker's Compensation \r\n  Law. Kennedy v. Williamsburg County, 242 S.C. 477, 480, 131 S.E.2d 512, \r\n  513 (1963). Such an award must not be based on surmise, conjecture, or speculation. \r\n  Id. \r\n\r\nGenerally, even though a claimant has reached MMI, if additional \r\n  medical care or treatment would \"tend to lessen the period of disability,\" then \r\n  the full commission may be warranted in requiring such treatment to at least \r\n  maintain the claimant's degree of physical impairment. Dodge v. Bruccoli, \r\n  Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 581, 514 S.E.2d 593, 597 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  That is, MMI \"is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau \r\n  that in the physician's opinion there is no further medical care or treatment \r\n  which will lessen the degree of impairment.\" Id. at 581, 514 S.E.2d at \r\n  596. Therefore, \"an employer may be liable for a claimant's future medical treatment \r\n  if it tends to lessen the claimant's period of disability despite the fact the \r\n  claimant has returned to work and has reached [MMI].\" Id. at 583, 514 \r\n  S.E.2d at 598.\r\n\r\nHere, it is undisputed that Lee, in fact, did return to \r\n  work in the summer of 1998. On cross examination before the single commissioner, \r\n  Lee admitted that he was receiving $200 per week in worker's compensation benefits \r\n  from an injury sustained only months before the hearing at his other employment.\r\n\r\nNone of the letters written by Lee's doctors directly address \r\n  Lee's ability to return to work or whether any future medical treatments would \r\n  be necessary to forestall Lee from becoming incapacitated. In fact, the only \r\n  person to directly address this issue was Dr. Lee Woodward in his Vocational \r\n  Evaluation report on March 17, 1997. &nbsp;In that report, Dr. Woodward found \r\n  \"no reason for [Lee] to be unable to work\" in his occupation as a cook, other \r\n  than his desire not to.\r\n\r\nUnder our scope of review, the findings of the full commission \r\n  will not be set aside if they are supported by substantial evidence and not \r\n  controlled by legal error. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d \r\n  304 (1981). We find substantial evidence in the record supports the full commission's \r\n  order denying future medical treatments for Lee's irritable bowel syndrome. \r\n  We find nothing in the record to refute the presumption that the full commission \r\n  weighed all the testimony and found that Lee, at least under the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Law, is not disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  affirming the full commission is\r\n\r\n\r\n  AFFIRMED. (5)\r\n\r\n  HEARN, C.J. and GOOLSBY, J., concur.  \r\n\r\n1. The Employer and its insurance carrier, \r\n  The Hartford Company, are joined as respondents to this appeal. For clarity, \r\n  these parties shall both be referred to as the \"Employer.\"  \r\n2. The full commission's order is not \r\n  included in the record on appeal. Nonetheless, in Lee's subsequent \"Appeal from \r\n  Workers Compensation Commission Panel Review\" filed December 2, 1999, he states \r\n  that the full commission made three findings:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. That the Single Commissioner's finding that the Carrier \r\n    shall pay to [Lee] 25 weeks of permanent partial disability for a partial \r\n    loss of his \"psychological system\" is an error at law and simply not supported \r\n    by the evidence in the record;\r\n  2. That the Employer/Carrier shall not be responsible \r\n    for any prescriptions and/or medical treatment after the date of [MMI], which \r\n    is May 25, 1998; and\r\n  3. That the Hearing Commissioner's finding that [Lee] \r\n    is due 10 weeks for partial loss of use of his rectum is hereby affirmed. \r\n     \r\n\r\n3. Sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20 govern \r\n  the award of compensation for total and partial disability, respectively. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 2001); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985).  \r\n4.  However, we find any reading beyond \r\n  the finding that a psychological impairment is not a scheduled loss unnecessarily \r\n  expands the holding in Fields. \r\n5.  We decide this case without oral \r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3495","title":"Cothran v.

McFaddin. The trial \r\n  court granted Cothran partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. A \r\n  panel of this court reversed. We granted Cothran's Petition for Rehearing En \r\n  Banc to consider whether Brown should be judicially estopped from asserting \r\n  comparative negligence. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWhile looking for his dogs, McFaddin parked his \r\n  westbound truck on the eastbound shoulder near a curve of a road with the headlights \r\n  on. According to Brown, as he approached the curve he saw headlights in his \r\n  lane of travel, so he veered to the right to avoid a head-on collision. Brown \r\n  struck McFaddin and his truck, resulting in McFaddin's death. Brown failed several \r\n  field sobriety tests and registered a .17 on a breathalyzer test. He was indicted \r\n  for felony driving under the influence (DUI) and pled guilty to reckless homicide.\r\n\r\nAs the personal representative of her husband's \r\n  estate, McFaddin's wife brought this action asserting wrongful death and survival \r\n  claims. (1) Brown answered, admitting that his \r\n  vehicle ran off the paved portion of the highway and struck McFaddin but asserting \r\n  that comparative negligence applied because McFaddin's actions caused Brown \r\n  to believe the truck was approaching in his lane. Cothran moved for summary \r\n  judgment as to liability, asserting there was no genuine issue of material fact \r\n  regarding Brown's liability.\r\n\r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, the trial court considered three affidavits:  two by Brown and one by Maechearda McCray.  In\r\nan affidavit prepared at the time of his guilty plea, Brown stated: \"There was nothing Mr. McFadden did to cause the accident,\r\nand there was nothing he could have done to avoid the accident.  The accident was all my fault and was caused by the fact that I\r\nhad had too much to drink and should have never been driving.\"  Brown gave a second affidavit in connection with the instant\r\ncivil action which painted a completely different picture of the accident.  He there claimed: \"The only reason this accident\r\noccurred was due to Mr. McFadden parking his vehicle in the position that he did which allowed his headlights to shine down the\r\nroadway at such an angle as to make it appear to any motorist traveling towards him that Mr. McFadden's vehicle was in their\r\nlane of travel.\"  The affidavit of McCray, who was with Brown shortly before the collision, related her belief that Brown was\r\nnot intoxicated when he left her.  She also alleged that she returned to the accident scene with Brown and \"observed that the\r\nlights of the McFadden vehicle appeared to be shining directly down the lane of travel . . . making it appear that the McFadden\r\nvehicle was traveling towards me in my lane of travel; it is my belief that this is the same view that Alvin Brown would have had\r\nas he approached the McFadden vehicle and that this is the reason Mr. Brown swerved to his right and off of the roadway in an\r\neffort to avoid a head-on collision.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted Cothran partial summary \r\n  judgment on the issue of liability based on the doctrines of judicial estoppel \r\n  and collateral estoppel. (2) This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if \"the pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see Bessinger v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 329 S.C. 617, \r\n  619, 496 S.E.2d 33, 34 (Ct. App. 1998). In determining whether any triable issues \r\n  of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it must be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. Summer \r\n  v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Judicial Estoppel\r\n\r\nCothran argues that the trial court's order granting summary judgment should be affirmed because Brown is judicially estopped\r\nfrom contesting liability in this action.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of judicial estoppel evolved to protect \r\n  the truth-seeking function of the judicial process by punishing those who seek \r\n  to misrepresent facts to gain advantage. Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, \r\n  327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997); see  also John \r\n  S. Clark Co. v. Faggert &amp; Frieden, P.C., 65 F.3d 26, 29 (4th Cir. 1995) \r\n  (stating goal of judicial estoppel \"is to prevent a party from playing 'fast \r\n  and loose' with the courts, and to protect the essential integrity of the process.\"). \r\n  As explicitly embraced by our supreme court, \"[j]udicial estoppel precludes \r\n  a party from adopting a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same \r\n  or related litigation.\" Hayne, 327 S.C. at 251, 489 S.E.2d at 477. \"When a party \r\n  has formally asserted a certain version of the facts in litigation, he cannot \r\n  later change those facts when the initial version no longer suits him.\" Id. \r\n  However, the Hayne court only adopted the doctrine as it applies to facts, not \r\n  law.\r\n\r\nThe application of judicial estoppel \"is an equitable \r\n  concept, depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual case, [and] \r\n  application of the doctrine is discretionary.\" Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 \r\n  S.C. 75, 83-84, 552 S.E.2d 767, 772 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Hawkins v. Bruno \r\n  Yacht Sales, Inc., 342 S.C. 352, 368, 536 S.E.2d 698, 706 (Ct. App. 2000), \r\n  cert. granted Sept. 27, 2001)). Generally, for the doctrine to apply, \r\n  courts look to the following factors: \r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.  Second, . . . whether the party has succeeded\r\nin persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later\r\nproceeding would create 'the perception that either the first or the second court was misled, . . . .'  A third consideration is\r\nwhether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the\r\nopposing party if not estopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.H. v. Me., 532 U.S. 742, 750-51 (2001) \r\n  (citations omitted); see Lowery v. Stovall, 92 F.3d 219 (4th Cir. \r\n  1996). (3)  \r\n \"Judicial acceptance means only that the first \r\n  court has adopted the position urged by the party . . . as part of a final disposition.\" \r\n  Lowery, 92 F.3d at 224-25. The above outlined approach emphasizes the \r\n  potential for harm to the judicial process.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the same party presented two patently \r\n  inconsistent sets of facts in two different courts. In the earlier proceeding, \r\n  Brown and his attorney repeatedly told the court that the accident was entirely \r\n  Brown's fault because he had been drinking and driving. In addition, Brown's \r\n  attorney stated that McFaddin in no way caused the accident. Brown presented \r\n  one set of facts at his guilty plea proceeding in the interest of receiving \r\n  a more lenient sentence but now attempts to assert a different set of facts \r\n  to lessen his civil liability. Based on the facts presented at his guilty plea, \r\n  Brown was allowed to plead guilty to reckless homicide, an offense carrying \r\n  a maximum ten year sentence, rather than felony DUI which carries a maximum \r\n  twenty-five year sentence. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-5-2910 \r\n  &amp; 2945 (Supp.2001) (providing sentences for reckless homicide and felony \r\n  DUI respectively). In reliance on that set of facts, the plea judge sentenced \r\n  him to only six years imprisonment. Permitting Brown to assert different facts \r\n  in this action could result in the appearance that one court or the other was \r\n  misled. Moreover, allowing Brown to change his story now might result in an \r\n  unfair advantage to him. It would be unfair to allow him to reap the benefit \r\n  of a lesser sentence by admitting culpability but avoid civil liability by denying \r\n  it.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that Brown was judicially \r\n  estopped from presenting facts inconsistent with those presented at his guilty \r\n  plea proceeding, including the McCray affidavit. Those facts are conclusive \r\n  as to liability. Therefore, there was no issue of material fact remaining on \r\n  the issue. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment. \r\n  \r\n\r\nII. Competing Affidavits \r\n  and Summary Judgment\r\n\r\nCothran also argues that the trial court's order \r\n  should be affirmed on its merits because when the evidence is viewed in the \r\n  light most favorable to Brown, summary judgment is warranted. We agree. \r\n   (4)\r\n\r\nBrown contends that his conflicting affidavits together with McCray's affidavit, create an issue of fact that should preclude\r\nsummary judgment.  Cothran contends that Brown should not be permitted to create an issue of fact by submitting affidavits that\r\nconflict with his sworn statement prepared at the time of his guilty plea.\r\n\r\nBecause our courts have not spoken on this issue, \r\n  we may seek guidance from federal cases. See Gardner v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, \r\n  Inc., 304 S.C. 328, 330, 404 S.E.2d 200, 201 (1991) (\"Since our Rules of \r\n  Procedure are based on the Federal Rules, where there is no South Carolina law, \r\n  we look to the construction placed on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"). \r\n  Numerous federal courts have held that a party may not create an issue of fact \r\n  for purposes of summary judgment by submitting an affidavit to contradict that \r\n  party's own prior sworn affidavit. See generally 11 James W. Moore Moore's \r\n  Federal Practice Â§ 56.14[1][f] (3d ed. 2001) (\"[P]arties may not intentionally \r\n  create a triable issue of fact by submitting conflicting submissions.\"). Our \r\n  own Fourth Circuit has held: \"A genuine issue of material fact is not created \r\n  where the only issue of fact is to determine which of the two conflicting versions \r\n  of the plaintiff's testimony is correct.\" Barwick v. Celotex Corp., 736 \r\n  F.2d 946, 960 (4th Cir. 1984). (5) We believe \r\n  the federal precedent on this issue is sound and persuasive. Brown should not \r\n  be permitted to create an issue of fact in order to survive summary judgment \r\n  by submitting an affidavit that directly contradicts his own prior sworn testimony.\r\n\r\nIn cases of competing affidavits, we find that \r\n  the trial court may disregard the later affidavit if it is submitted solely \r\n  to create a factual issue to avoid summary judgment. See Rohrbough \r\n  v. Wyeth Labs., Inc., 916 F.2d 970, 975 (4th Cir. 1990) (affirming trial \r\n  court's refusal to consider physician's conclusory affidavit issued in contradiction \r\n  to his deposition testimony for the purpose of surviving summary judgment); \r\n  Franks v. Nimmo, 796 F.2d 1230, 1237 (10th Cir. 1986)(\"[C]ourts will \r\n  disregard a contrary affidavit when they conclude that it constitutes an attempt \r\n  to create a sham fact issue.\"). In this case, the second affidavit was not based \r\n  on any facts unknown to Brown when he gave his first affidavit and was given \r\n  only in the interest of furthering his comparative negligence claim. This situation \r\n  is distinguishable from one in which the affiant's statements rely on newly \r\n  discovered evidence or merely seek to explain earlier testimony. Franks \r\n  at 1237. Accordingly, Brown's second affidavit should not have been considered \r\n  by the trial court.\r\n\r\nWith respect to McCray's affidavit, we initially \r\n  note that materials used to support or contravene a motion for summary judgment \r\n  must be admissible at trial. See Moss v. Porter Bros., Inc., 292 \r\n  S.C. 444, 448, 357 S.E.2d 25, 28 (Ct. App. 1987); Saro Invs. v. Ocean Holiday \r\n  P'ship, 314 S.C. 116, 121, 441 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1994). The portion \r\n  of her affidavit about what other people told her is inadmissible under the \r\n  hearsay rule. See Rule 801, SCRE. Her statement \"it is my belief that \r\n  this is the same view that Alvin Brown would have had . . . and that this is \r\n  the reason Mr. Brown swerved . . . .\" is likewise inadmissible as opinion testimony \r\n  of the ultimate fact at issue. See Richmond v. Tecklenberg, 302 \r\n  S.C. 331, 334, 396 S.E.2d 111, 113 (Ct. App. 1990) (\"The general rule is that \r\n  opinion testimony which is determinative of the ultimate fact in issue should \r\n  be excluded as an invasion of the province of the factfinder.\"). The remaining \r\n  language in her affidavit does not create an issue of material fact.\r\n\r\nWith the exclusion of Brown's second affidavit \r\n  and portions of McCray's affidavit, Brown's first affidavit leaves no issue \r\n  of material fact as to liability. Accordingly, we also affirm the grant of summary \r\n  judgment on this ground.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   (6)\r\n\r\nCURETON, CONNOR, HUFF, JJ., and MANNING, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concurring in part.\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\nPYLE, A.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\r\n\r\nPYLE, A.J. (concurring in part and \r\n  dissenting in part):  I would hold that the \r\n  trial judge was correct in granting summary judgment against the defendant on \r\n  the issue of liability but was in error in applying the doctrine of judicial \r\n  estoppel to the facts of this case.\r\n\r\n\"Judicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting \r\n  a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.\" \r\n  Hayne Federal Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, \r\n  477 (1977). The trial judge erred in finding Brown's position, that McFaddin \r\n  contributed to the accident, was inconsistent with his position during his guilty \r\n  plea and that it was an intentional attempt to mislead the court in order to \r\n  gain an unfair advantage in the civil proceeding. Brown's attorney, at his plea, \r\n  conceding Brown's recklessness, asserted that McFaddin's headlights confused \r\n  Brown. He had experts prepare a video of the scene as it appeared at the time \r\n  of the accident to demonstrate Brown's confusion. Brown himself asserted he \r\n  was blinded because McFaddin was parked in a curve facing him and that had he \r\n  swerved to the left instead of the right he possibly would have hit another \r\n  motorist head on.\r\n\r\nI believe that:\r\n\r\n1. McFaddin's negligence, if any, was not an issue \r\n  that had to be considered by the court in connection with Brown's plea to reckless \r\n  homicide;\r\n\r\n2. Brown's recklessness did not have to be the \r\n  sole proximate cause for him to be found guilty of reckless homicide so long \r\n  as it is a proximate cause.\r\n\r\n3. In the civil context any negligence on the part \r\n  of McFaddin would be used to reduce the amount of Cothran's recovery in direct \r\n  proportion to the percentage of McFaddin's negligence, if any, under the concept \r\n  of comparative negligence.\r\n\r\n4. While Brown is bound by his factual admissions \r\n  from his guilty plea, the relative degree of culpability was not at issue nor \r\n  was it decided in the prior proceeding. Because plaintiff's relative fault, \r\n  if any, was not an issue in his guilty plea, Brown has not yet had a full and \r\n  fair opportunity to contest it.\r\n\r\n5. The grant of summary judgment in Cothran's favor \r\n  on the basis of judicial estoppel was in error.\r\n\r\nI would affirm the granting of partial summary \r\n  judgment on the issue of Brown's liability, but would reverse the circuit court's \r\n  application of judicial estoppel to this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The complaint was amended \r\n  on April 28, 1998, at which time Cothran was substituted as the personal representative. \r\n2. The trial court later amended \r\n  its order to include only the doctrine of judicial estoppel as a ground for \r\n  granting summary judgment. \r\n3.  The \r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has not adopted a precise test to be used in determining \r\n  judicial estoppel. This court has previously suggested but never applied the \r\n  following test:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) two inconsistent positions must be taken by \r\n    the same party or parties in privity with each other;\r\n    (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving \r\n    the same parties or parties in privity with each other;\r\n    (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining \r\n    the first position and must have received some benefit;\r\n    (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the \r\n    court; and\r\n    (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent\r\n\r\n\r\nCarrigg, 347 S.C. at 83, 552 S.E.2d at 772 \r\n  (citing 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel &amp; Waiver Â§ 74 (2000)). Based on Hayne, it \r\n  does not appear that the second prong of the test articulated above would apply \r\n  because the parties were not all the same and the proceedings were completely \r\n  unrelated. In Hayne, a father purchased a piece of property but titled it in \r\n  his son's name. During his divorce, the father denied any legal interest in \r\n  the property and claimed that it belonged to his son. The son then died, leaving \r\n  the property to his wife, and the father did not file a claim against the estate. \r\n  Thereafter, the father filed a claim in a foreclosure action asserting ownership \r\n  of the property by way of a resulting trust. The court found the father was \r\n  judicially estopped from claiming ownership of the property.\r\n\r\n4. The trial court based its \r\n  ruling on the ground of judicial estoppel. This court, however, is not limited \r\n  to that ground in affirming the trial court's order. \"The appellate court may \r\n  review respondent's additional reasons and, if convinced it is proper and fair \r\n  to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm \r\n  the lower court's judgment.\" I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 \r\n  S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000); see Rule 220 (c), SCACR. However, \r\n  this court should not base its decision on Rule 220(c) when the reason does \r\n  not appear in the record or \"when the court believes it would be unwise or unjust \r\n  to do so in a particular case.\" Id. \r\n5.  Other \r\n  federal circuits have reached the same result. See Disc Golf Ass'n, \r\n  Inc. v. Champion Disc, Inc., 158 F.3d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir. 1998) (stating \r\n  that a party cannot create a triable issue of fact and thus escape summary judgment \r\n  by contradicting his or her own testimony); Nunez v. City of Los Angeles, \r\n  147 F.3d 867, 871 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"Alas, not good enough: a party cannot create \r\n  a triable issue by contradicting his own sworn testimony.\"); Hayes v. New \r\n  York City Dep't of Corrs., 84 F.3d 614 (2nd Cir. 1996) (holding that a party \r\n  may not create an issue of fact precluding summary judgment by submitting affidavit \r\n  that, by omission or addition, contradicts affiant's previous testimony); Buckner \r\n  v. Sam's Club, Inc., 75 F.3d 290, 292 (7th Cir. 1996) (stating a party may \r\n  not create an issue of fact for purposes of summary judgment by submitting an \r\n  affidavit contradicting prior testimony); Rios v. Bigler, 67 F.3d 1543 \r\n  (10th Cir. 1995) (stating that a party may not create a sham factual issue to \r\n  survive summary judgment by presenting an affidavit contrary to the affiant's \r\n  prior testimony, and the subsequent affidavit should be disregarded)) \r\n6.  We \r\n  disagree with Brown's contention in his petition for rehearing that this opinion \r\n  overlooks the uninsured carrier's right to defend pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38-77-150 (2002). For this argument, Brown cites to Broome v. Watts, \r\n  319 S.C. 337, 461 S.E.2d 46 (1995). In Broome, our supreme court held \r\n  that a settling defendant cannot waive the underinsured carrier's right to contest \r\n  liability in a jury trial. However, in this case, Brown has not waived any substantive \r\n  legal rights. Instead, his admissions have limited the facts in such a way that \r\n  he cannot prevail on any assertion of comparative negligence. Therefore, Broome \r\n  does not apply. If we were to accept this argument, we would in effect hold \r\n  that the uninsured carrier may be entitled to a more favorable set of facts \r\n  than the named defendant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3496","title":"Herring v.

(Defendants), \r\n  alleging a lawn mower he purchased was defective. The jury returned a verdict \r\n  in Herring's favor on the claim for revocation of acceptance, but denied recovery \r\n  on the breach of warranty claim. On appeal, the circuit court granted the Defendants \r\n  a new trial on the ground the jury verdict was inconsistent. Herring and the \r\n  Defendants cross-appeal. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1999, Herring purchased a 1999 Scotts Riding \r\n  Mower at a Home Depot in Charleston County. The purchase price was $3,495.88. \r\n  The mower was covered by a two-year, limited warranty issued by the manufacturer, \r\n  Deere &amp; Co. The limited warranty provided Deere would \"repair or replace, \r\n  at its option, any covered part which is found to be defective in material or \r\n  workmanship during the applicable warranty term,\" and that warranty repairs \r\n  had to be performed by an authorized repairman.\r\n\r\nAccording to Herring, he advised the sales personnel at \r\n  Home Depot that because of health problems, he needed an easy-to-ride mower \r\n  that could cut his almost two-acre yard. Hip replacements in both hips made \r\n  it impossible for Herring to use a push mower. According to Herring, a Home \r\n  Depot salesperson advised him that the Scotts Riding Mower would be perfect \r\n  for his needs.\r\n\r\nThe first few times Herring used the mower, he did not notice \r\n  any problems. In July 1999, as Herring attempted to mow his yard, the mower \r\n  made a loud noise, the engine smoked, and then it stopped running. Herring contacted \r\n  Home Depot and later Deere. Deere directed Herring to take the mower to Whitesville \r\n  Lawn and Farm Equipment, an authorized service center. Herring did so. Whitesville \r\n  replaced the engine seal and returned the mower approximately two weeks later. \r\n  When Herring picked up the mower, he noticed it rattled, vibrated, and smoked.\r\n\r\nFor several days, Herring tried unsuccessfully to speak \r\n  to the service manager at Whitesville. Each time Herring called, the manager \r\n  was either busy or out of the office. Within a few minutes of Herring's last \r\n  attempt to call, when Whitesville told Herring the manager would not be in that \r\n  day, Herring's wife was able to reach the manager by giving her maiden name \r\n  to the person who answered the phone. When the manager was on the line, Herring's \r\n  wife gave Herring the phone and Herring informed him the mower was still making \r\n  noise. The manager stated he would call the factory to see if it would authorize \r\n  a replacement engine. A few days later, the manager called back and said he \r\n  had a replacement engine and would install it. Herring took the mower back to \r\n  Whitesville on July 27, 1999.\r\n\r\nOn July 29, 1999, when Herring picked up the mower, he noticed \r\n  it was still making the same loud noise, notwithstanding Whitesville's claim \r\n  to have replaced the engine. Herring later testified, \"I didn't say anything \r\n  to [Whitesville] because I knew it wouldn't do any good.\"&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHerring showed the mower to another mechanic, Ken Gusta, \r\n  the owner of Gusta Outdoor Power Equipment. Gusta replaced the engine oil but \r\n  did not make any mechanical repairs. Approximately ten minutes after Gusta started \r\n  the engine, smoke started pouring out of the engine cover, the engine wires \r\n  caught fire and melted, and the engine died. Gusta advised Herring the mower \r\n  had an electrical problem.\r\n\r\nHerring called Home Depot and asked for a refund. Home Depot \r\n  denied any responsibility for the mower and referred Herring to Whitesville. \r\n  Herring told them he had already taken the mower to Whitesville twice but it \r\n  was not repaired properly. In Herring's opinion, Whitesville misrepresented \r\n  that it installed a new engine.\r\n\r\nIn January 2000, Herring filed this action in the Charleston \r\n  County Small Claims Court against Defendants, asserting causes of action for \r\n  (1)&nbsp;revocation of acceptance, (2) breach of implied and express warranties, \r\n  (3)&nbsp;violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and (4) violation of the \r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA). Herring further alleged nonconformities in \r\n  the mower made it impossible to use for its intended purpose and Defendants \r\n  \"unreasonably and unfairly\" refused to accept his return of the mower and give \r\n  him a refund of the purchase price. Herring also alleged \"Defendant John Deere \r\n  has failed to correct the . . . mower's defects after attempting numerous times \r\n  to do so\" and, although John Deere attempted to limit his rights to repair or \r\n  replacement of any defective parts, \"this exclusive remedy has failed of its \r\n  essential purpose.\" Defendants' answer denied the claims and asserted nineteen \r\n  defenses.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the jury awarded Herring $3,695.88 on his claim \r\n  for revocation of acceptance. (1) The magistrate \r\n  later reduced this amount to $3,495.88, the purchase price of the mower. Defendants \r\n  appealed to the circuit court.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court ruled the jury verdict permitting revocation \r\n  of acceptance without a finding of breach of warranty was inconsistent as a \r\n  matter of law and reversed, ordering a new trial. Herring and the Defendants \r\n  cross-appeal from this order.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Herring's Appeal \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHerring argues the circuit court erred in granting a new \r\n  trial based on an inconsistent jury verdict. We side with Herring.  \r\n\r\nBreach of warranty and revocation of acceptance are independent, \r\n  discrete causes of action. In General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Anaya, \r\n  (2) the court explained, \"[t]he theories 'are two distinct strands \r\n  of buyer's remedies under the Code.' Although a buyer may pursue either or both, \r\n  they are 'separate remedies treated in entirely different sections of the Code \r\n  and they offer separate forms of relief.'\" (3) \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen an exclusive or limited warranty fails of its essential \r\n  purpose, a party who purchases a product covered by such a warranty is not limited \r\n  to an action for breach of warranty but may seek other remedies, including revocation \r\n  of acceptance. (4) A warranty fails of its essential \r\n  purpose if the seller is unwilling or unable to repair or replace the product \r\n  or if there is an unreasonable delay in the repair or replacement of the product. \r\n  (5)\r\n\r\nSection 36-2-608 (6) describes \r\n  the elements of a cause of action for revocation of acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial \r\n    unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has \r\n    accepted it\r\n\r\n  (a) on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity \r\n    would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or\r\n\r\n  (b) without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance \r\n    was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance \r\n    or by the seller's assurances.\r\n\r\n  (2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable \r\n    time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it \r\n    and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused \r\n    by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller \r\n    of it.\r\n\r\n  (3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties \r\n    with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn action for breach of warranty requires the existence \r\n  of an express or implied warranty as described in sections 36-2-313 and 36-2-314, \r\n  (7) respectively, or an implied warranty of fitness for a particular \r\n  purpose, as defined in section 36-2-315.  (8)  \r\n   \r\n\r\nBreach of warranty is an action affirming the contract. \r\n  (9) In an action for breach of warranty, the buyer retains the goods. \r\n  (10) Revocation of acceptance, on the other hand, requires the return \r\n  of the goods and cancellation of the terms of a contract.  \r\n  (11)   \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the tests for a cause of action for breach \r\n  of warranty differ from those for revocation of acceptance. \r\n\r\nWhen goods do not conform to a promise or an affirmation \r\n  of fact made by a seller, or the goods do not conform to a description, sample, \r\n  or model, then a seller has breached an express warranty. If the goods are not \r\n  merchantable, then the seller has breached an implied warranty. These are objective \r\n  tests.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, to revoke acceptance, the goods must have a \r\n  nonconformity that substantially impairs the value of the goods to the buyer. \r\n  This is a subjective test.  (12)   \r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions have held a finding of breach of warranty \r\n  is not necessary to sustain an action for revocation of acceptance. \r\n  (13) In Griffith v. Latham Motors, Inc., \r\n  (14) the Idaho Supreme Court specifically addressed whether a jury \r\n  verdict permitting revocation of acceptance against a party was inconsistent \r\n  with a jury finding that same party had not breached a warranty. The court concluded \r\n  there was no inconsistency, finding \"[w]hether an express or implied warranty \r\n  has been breached is included in the revocation determination only in the sense \r\n  that a breach of a warranty could substantially impair the value of the goods \r\n  to the buyer. But the determinations each have a different standard.\"  \r\n  (15) \r\n\r\nBecause of the contradictory elements, if the facts sustain \r\n  one cause of action, the other cannot be present. At least one court has noted \r\n  that a verdict entitling plaintiff to recovery on both causes of action, as \r\n  defendants argue was required in this case, would itself be inconsistent because \r\n  a finding of one extinguishes the other. (16)\r\n\r\nIn this case, the jury properly recognized that Herring \r\n  was not entitled to recover on both causes of action and only permitted him \r\n  to recover on the action for revocation of acceptance. \r\n  (17) There was no error in this verdict.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  a new trial on the ground that a jury award for revocation of acceptance is \r\n  inconsistent with a jury's denial of a recovery under a breach of warranty theory. \r\n  We therefore reverse the circuit court's order and reinstate the jury's verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Defendants' Appeal  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Defendants contend the circuit court erred by \r\n  granting a new trial because the remedy of revocation of acceptance is not a \r\n  separate cause of action and by denying their motion for directed verdict on \r\n  the grounds that (1) the evidence showed Herring purposely failed to provide \r\n  a sufficient opportunity for Deere to repair or replace the mower and (2) there \r\n  is no evidence the warranty failed of its essential purpose because the uncontroverted \r\n  evidence showed the mower could be repaired. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nIn finding above that the circuit court erroneously reversed \r\n  the jury verdict, we have disposed of defendant's argument that the trial court \r\n  erred in charging the jury as to both revocation of acceptance and breach of \r\n  warranty.  (18)   \r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Defendants' argument concerning the magistrate's \r\n  denial of their motion for directed verdict, our review of this issue is precluded \r\n  by the fact that the circuit court did not rule on it. \r\n  (19) \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J. concur. \r\n\r\n1.   According to the circuit court's order in this case, the amount of the jury verdict\r\nrepresented the cost of the lawnmower ($3,495.88) plus $200.00 \"in incidental/consequential\r\ndamages.\"  Herring testified he spent \"several hundred dollars\" repairing his old lawn mower\r\nso that he could use it when the Deere mower quit working.\r\n2.  703 P.2d 169 (N.M. 1985).  \r\n3.  703 P.2d at 171 (citation omitted). \r\n   \r\n4.

Anaya, \r\n  the court observed:\r\n\r\nThere was substantial and persuasive evidence to support \r\n  the jury's finding of liability under the Anayas' claim of revocation of acceptance. \r\n  Consequently, the additional finding of liability under breach of warranty \r\n  by the jury is inconsistent as a matter of law, and j.n.o.v. on damages \r\n  for breach of warranty was correct.\r\n\r\nId. at 172 (citations omitted).  \r\n17.  The general verdict form did not \r\n  require the jury to make a specific finding the warranty failed of its essential \r\n  purpose. Defendants make a conclusory argument that Herring is not entitled \r\n  to recover \"unless there is a breach of warranty and the warranty fails its \r\n  essential purpose.\" (Emphasis added.) For the reasons discussed above, we \r\n  disagree that Herring was also required to prove breach of warranty.  \r\n18.  Nonetheless, we note that in Adams \r\n  v. Grant, 292 S.C. 581, 358 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App. 1986), this court found \r\n  the trial court did not err in submitting both causes of action to the jury. \r\n  See also Official Comment, S.C.

Waldron, II, (Waldron) a radiologist, brought this action against \r\n  Richland Memorial Hospital (RMH) and the other named respondents asserting RMH \r\n  was obligated by the terms of its hospital bylaws and regulations to equitably \r\n  allocate all \"undesignated\" radiological work among the radiologists on staff. \r\n  Waldron contends that RMH violated its hospital bylaws and regulations when \r\n  it entered into an exclusive contract which prevented his participation in the \r\n  allocation of radiological work. Waldron appeals the order of the circuit court \r\n  dismissing his complaint with prejudice. We affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted by the trial court, \"[t]he facts and procedural \r\n  history of this case are somewhat complex.\" (1) \r\n  Waldron is a physician licensed to practice medicine in South Carolina. He is \r\n  board certified in radiology with a certificate of added qualifications (CAQ) \r\n  in neuroradiology. He has been an active member of the medical staff at RMH \r\n  for over sixteen years with full admitting privileges within the Department \r\n  of Radiology. From 1981 to 1989, Waldron served as the department's Professional \r\n  Director. The Professional Director is an independent contractor with RMH who, \r\n  for a fixed fee, performs certain contractually-defined services relating to \r\n  the oversight of the Department of Radiology.\r\n\r\nThe practice of radiology is recognized as a hospital-based \r\n  practice. In accordance with the hospital's Medical/Dental Staff Bylaws, Rules \r\n  and Regulations dated May 1994 (Bylaws) and the Department of Radiology's Rules \r\n  and Regulations (as implemented by the Medical Executive Committee (MEC)), Waldron \r\n  was required to devote at least 120 hours per month to the Department of Radiology \r\n  and was not entitled to practice at any hospital other than RMH. \r\n\r\nAll of the physician parties to this litigation were radiologists \r\n  and former partners in Richland Radiological Associates (RRA). \r\n  (2) RRA was organized, in part, to provide radiological services to \r\n  RMH. RRA consisted of Waldron, Dr. Paresh Shah, Dr. Edward R. Sun, Dr. W. John \r\n  Bayard, and several other radiologists. \r\n\r\nAfter a considerable period of disagreement over the way \r\n  radiological services were being provided, RRA was dissolved on February 24, \r\n  1995. Bayard, along with all of the former members of RRA except Waldron, Shah, \r\n  and Sun, thereafter formed a new group, Richland Radiological Consultants (RRC). \r\n  Waldron, Shah, and Sun were not asked to join RRC. Waldron has since practiced \r\n  as an independent radiologist at RMH. \r\n\r\nIn December 1995, Bayard signed a three-year contract with \r\n  RMH to be its Professional Director of the Department of Radiology. The contract \r\n  was for the period of January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998. The contract allowed \r\n  Bayard to assign all \"undesignated\" radiological work at RMH to his group, RRC. \r\n  (3) \"Undesignated\" radiological procedures are those where the treating \r\n  physician does not specify a particular radiologist to perform the work.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1996, Bayard sent letters to Waldron, Shah, and Sun advising them that, effective\r\nMarch 1, 1996, he would exercise his authority under the Professional Director's contract and\r\naward all undesignated work to his group, RRC.  Bayard's letters advised Waldron, Shah, and Sun\r\nthat they would be permitted to continue practicing at the hospital, but their practice would be\r\nlimited to cases specifically designated for them.  According to Waldron, during his sixteen-plus\r\nyears at RMH, all radiologists in the department had shared equitably in the undesignated cases on\r\na rotating basis. The undesignated work comprised nearly all of the radiological work performed\r\nat RMH.\r\n\r\nWaldron, Shah, and Sun filed this action on February 20, 1996, before the proposed change in the\r\nrotation schedule on March 1st, seeking a declaratory judgment that the proposed duty schedule\r\nviolated the Bylaws and regulations of the hospital and the State Ethics Act.  They also sought a\r\npermanent injunction barring the respondents from instituting the exclusive contractual\r\narrangement, which granted RRC the exclusive right to treat undesignated patients, and the\r\nproposed duty rotation schedule, which excluded the appellants from treating undesignated\r\npatients as of March 1, 1996.  In its final form, the complaint sought a declaratory judgment and\r\npermanent injunction and asserted claims for breach of contract, unfair trade practices, violation of\r\n42 U.S.C. Â§&nbsp;1983, and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relations. \r\nThe appellants essentially asserted RMH had violated the Bylaws by giving Bayard an exclusive\r\nProfessional Director's contract, which allowed him to assign all of the undesignated work in the\r\nhospital to his own group, RRC, to the exclusion of the appellants. (4) \r\n\r\nThe circuit court issued a temporary restraining order on February 29, 1996, and a preliminary\r\ninjunction on August 14, 1996, requiring RMH to preserve the \"status quo\" during the pendency\r\nof this litigation.\r\n\r\nIn July 1996, RMH and Baptist Healthcare System of South Carolina,  Inc. entered into a Pre-Incorporation and Joint Operating Agreement.  Pursuant thereto, on February 9, 1998, RMH\r\nformally transferred all operational control of the hospital to the Palmetto Health Alliance\r\n(Alliance), a private, nonprofit entity organized as a 501(c)(3) corporation.  On December 31,\r\n1998, the disputed radiology contract with Bayard expired by its own terms.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Bayard moved for a nonjury trial.  Waldron opposed the motion.  On March 23, 1999, the\r\ntrial court entered an order granting Bayard's motion stating \"all claims in equity and issues of law\r\nwill be heard and decided by the Court.\"\r\n\r\nThe case proceeded to a bench trial on May 4 and 5, 1999, on the claims for breach of contract,\r\ndeclaratory judgment, and an injunction.  At the commencement of trial, Respondents moved to\r\ndismiss those claims on the ground of mootness.  On May 6, 1999, the parties met in chambers. \r\nThereafter, several hearings were held on various motions submitted by the parties.  Waldron\r\nmoved (1) to amend the pleadings to add or substitute the Alliance and Palmetto Richland\r\nMemorial Hospital as parties, (2) for Leave to Supplement the Record, and (3) to preserve his jury\r\ntrial rights on the remaining causes of action.  No additional testimony was taken at these\r\nhearings.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1999, the trial court entered an order denying the motion to amend the\r\ncomplaint to substitute or join as defendants the Alliance and Palmetto Richland Memorial\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nOn December 27, 1999, the trial court entered an Order of Dismissal granting Respondent's\r\nmotion to dismiss the three causes of action for breach of contract, declaratory judgment, and a\r\npermanent injunction.  The court dismissed the causes of action on the ground of mootness, noting\r\na jury trial date would be set for the remaining causes of action.  Waldron moved to alter or amend\r\nthe order on January 5, 2000.  He also filed a motion for a stay of the jury trial on the remaining\r\ncauses of action.\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 2000, the court entered three additional orders:  (1) granting the appellants' motion\r\nfor leave to supplement the record, (2) denying appellants' motion to stay the jury trial of the\r\nremaining causes of action, and (3) amending the 12/17/99 Order of Dismissal on the ground of\r\nmootness.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Amendment of Complaint\r\n\r\nWaldron first contends the trial court misapprehended the law of successor liability and erred in\r\ndenying the motion to amend the complaint to substitute or join the Alliance as a party defendant. \r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nIn August 1999, the appellants moved to amend the Third Amended Complaint to substitute or\r\njoin as party defendants the Alliance and Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital pursuant to Rules\r\n15(a) and 25(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  The motion was made on the\r\ngrounds that the Alliance had contractually assumed the liabilities of its predecessor, RMH, and\r\nRMH now does \"business under the trade name Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court denied the motion on the grounds that (1)&nbsp;the appellants waited\r\nmore than 1Â½ years after the creation of the Alliance before making the motion, (2) the formation\r\nof the Alliance was not the result of a mere name change, (3) the Alliance would be prejudiced by\r\njoinder because it did not participate in the extensive discovery conducted by the existing parties,\r\nand (4) the trial had already begun without the Alliance, thus adding the Alliance would require a\r\nmistrial and an additional delay.  The court expressly \"acknowledge[d] that the Rules require that\r\namendments be 'freely' allowed when justice requires and there is no prejudice.\"  However, the\r\ncourt found \"that justice does not require either the proposed amendments or the substitution of\r\nparties sought by Plaintiffs . . . [and] that the Defendants, and the Alliance, would suffer\r\nsubstantial prejudice were Plaintiffs' Motions to be granted.\"\r\n\r\nRule 19(a)(1), SCRCP, provides in pertinent part that a person subject to process shall be joined as\r\na party in the action if \"in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already\r\nparties.\"  The notes to Rule 19 indicate that this rule is the same as the federal rule, and that the\r\nprinciple behind the rule is \"that whenever possible persons materially interested in the action\r\nshall be joined so that they may be heard and a complete determination made.\"  Rule 25(c),\r\nSCRCP, provides:  \"In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against\r\nthe original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is\r\ntransferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court had the authority under Rule 19, SCRCP, \r\n  to join the Alliance and Palmetto as parties if the same was necessary to afford \r\n  complete relief to appellants. Moreover, under Rule 25, SCRCP, the trial court \r\n  could have substituted the Alliance and Palmetto as parties instead of RMH. \r\n  \"The test of whether an amendment should be allowed is whether the amendment \r\n  will prejudice or work an injustice to the adverse party.\" Forrester v. Smith \r\n  &amp; Steele Builders, Inc., 295 S.C. 504, 509, 369 S.E.2d 156, 159 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1988). \"Delay in seeking leave to amend pleadings, regardless of the length \r\n  of the delay, will not ordinarily be held to bar an amendment in the absence \r\n  of a finding of prejudice.\" Id. at 508, 369 S.E.2d at 159 (emphasis \r\n  added). The burden of establishing prejudice is on the party opposing the motion. \r\n  Pruitt v. Bowers, 330 S.C. 483, 489, 499 S.E.2d 250, 253 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \"In the absence of a proper reason, such as bad faith, undue delay, or prejudice, \r\n  a denial of leave to amend is an abuse of discretion.\" Forrester, 295 \r\n  S.C. at 507, 369 S.E.2d at 158.\r\n\r\nThe trial court in effect concluded it was not feasible \r\n  to join the Alliance as a party because the case had progressed to the point \r\n  that adding the Alliance as a party would prejudice the Alliance. However, the \r\n  evidence before the trial court also established that the Alliance had a material \r\n  interest in the litigation. We note that the 1998 Assignment and Assumption \r\n  Agreement forming the Alliance specifically provides that the Alliance assumed \r\n  the liabilities and obligations of RMH. Moreover, at the September 30, 1999 \r\n  hearing in this matter, the Alliance's attorney acknowledged that the Alliance \r\n  would be liable for any judgments incurred by its predecessor, RMH. As a result, \r\n  the addition of the Alliance as a party was necessary so that the party who \r\n  would be ultimately responsible for the judgment would have an opportunity to \r\n  be heard, thus providing a complete determination of the liability flowing from \r\n  Respondent's conduct. Rule 19(a)(1) SCRCP, appears to mandate that under the \r\n  circumstances of this case, the Alliance should be made a party in order to \r\n  preclude Waldron from having to pursue future lawsuits against the Alliance \r\n  to enforce judgments he may obtain against Respondents. 7 Charles A. Wright \r\n  et al., Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d Â§1603 (2001).\r\n\r\nWe find the Alliance would not be unduly prejudiced by being made a party to the litigation.  Its\r\naddition would not only avoid multiplicity of actions, but would afford the Alliance the\r\nopportunity to participate in the making or avoidance of a judgment it could be called upon to\r\nsatisfy.  The trial court, therefore, erred in failing to grant Waldron leave to amend his pleadings to\r\nadd the Alliance as a party.\r\n\r\nII.  Mootness\r\n\r\nWaldron next contends the trial court erred in concluding his causes of action for breach of\r\ncontract, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief should be dismissed on the ground of\r\nmootness.  Waldron argues the trial court misapprehended and misapplied the law with regard to\r\nthe mootness doctrine and the exceptions to the doctrine. Waldron also avers the trial court\r\nmisapprehended and misapplied the law with regard to the law of declaratory judgments,\r\ninjunctive relief and the creation of contractual rights.  We agree in  part.\r\n\r\nRespondents moved to dismiss the complaint essentially alleging the complaint was moot because\r\n(1) the disputed radiology contract between RMH and Bayard expired by its own terms on\r\nDecember 31, 1998, (2) the injunctions issued in this case preserved the status quo and enjoined\r\nthe respondents from implementing the proposed change in the duty schedule, and (3) the\r\ngovernmental entity, RMH, no longer operates the radiology department following the\r\nconsummation of the Joint Operating Agreement (between the hospital and Baptist Healthcare\r\nSystem, dated July 10, 1996) and the resulting assignment of the radiology contract to the Alliance\r\non February 9, 1998.\r\n\r\nThe trial court dismissed the breach of contract cause of action finding that the action was moot. \r\nThe trial court held that the formation of the Alliance and its assumption of operational control of\r\nthe hospital prevented the court from granting effective relief because RMH had ceased to exist\r\nand there was no party that could be bound by its ruling.    Additionally, the trial court determined\r\nthat it was not necessary to address the issue of whether the Bylaws, rules and regulations and\r\ncourse of dealing between the parties created a contract providing Waldron with certain rights to\r\nthe equitable distribution of the undesignated radiological procedures.  The trial court held the\r\ntemporary injunction granted by the court prevented the implementation of the proposed rotational\r\nschedule and, because the contract is now expired, Waldron could prove no damages.\r\n\r\nWaldron contends the trial court erred in holding that, even assuming the Bylaws formed a\r\ncontract and the contract was breached by the proposed scheduling of the undesignated\r\nprocedures, he was unable to establish damages flowing from a breach because the temporary\r\ninjunction  prevented the implementation of the proposed duty rotation schedule.   Waldron asserts\r\nthat it was an error for the trial court not to permit evidence on the issue of damages, arguing he\r\nsuffered collateral damages from the proposed duty rotation schedule despite the issuance of the\r\npreliminary injunction by the court.  We agree.\r\n\r\nInitially we find that the trial court erred in holding that there is no entity against which a\r\njudgment may be enforced, finding that there was nothing in the Assignment and Assumption\r\nAgreement that indicated a judgment could be enforced against the Alliance.  Our review of the\r\nrecord, however, shows that the attorney for the Alliance conceded at a motion hearing that the\r\nlanguage in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement  means that if there is any judgment in\r\nthis case the Alliance has responsibility for satisfying the judgment.\r\n\r\nBecause Waldron does not limit his allegation of damages to the institution of the proposed duty\r\nrotation schedule, we further find the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that Waldron\r\ncould not prove any damages flowed from the alleged breach of the Bylaws contract as there was\r\nno evidence presented to the court regarding what the damages may have been.  We find that\r\nwhether or not Waldron is able to prove damages goes to whether there is evidence to support his\r\ncause of action.   Therefore, the fact the schedule was not instituted is not determinative of\r\nwhether this cause of action is moot and is not appropriately addressed in a motion to dismiss on\r\nthe ground of mootness.  Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding Waldron's first cause of\r\naction for breach of contract was moot.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Waldron argues the trial court erred in finding that the requests for a declaratory\r\njudgment and a permanent injunction were likewise moot.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAn appellate court \"will not pass on moot and academic questions \r\n  or make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.\" Mathis \r\n  v. South Carolina State Highway Dep't, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, \r\n  714 (1973). \"A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical \r\n  legal effect upon [an] existing controversy. This is true when some event occurs \r\n  making it impossible for [a] reviewing [c]ourt to grant effectual relief.\" Id. \r\n  at 346, 195 S.E.2d at 715. \"Moot appeals differ from unripe appeals in that \r\n  moot appeals result when intervening events render a case nonjusticiable.\" Curtis \r\n  v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001).\r\n\r\nIn the civil context, there are three general exceptions \r\n  to the mootness doctrine. Curtis, 345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, an appellate court can take jurisdiction, despite mootness, if the issue raised is capable of\r\nrepetition but evading review.   Second, an appellate court may decide questions of imperative and\r\nmanifest urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest. \r\nFinally, if a decision by the trial court may affect future events, or have collateral consequences\r\nfor the parties, an appeal from that decision is not moot, even though the appellate court cannot\r\ngive effective relief in the present case.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn his complaint, Waldron sought a declaration that Bayard and Freeman, as public employees or\r\npublic officials, were obligated to avoid conflicts of interest, and that the exclusive contractual\r\narrangement and the proposed duty rotation schedule violated the State Ethics Act. (5)  Waldron\r\nalso sought permanent injunctive relief restraining RMH from instituting the exclusive contractual\r\narrangement which grants RRC the exclusive right to perform the undesignated procedures,\r\neffectively preventing Waldron from participating in the treatment of undesignated patients.\r\n\r\nThe trial court noted the State Ethics Act applies only to public officials, members, and employees\r\nand found \"RMH, as a governmental health care provider, was subject to the State Ethics Act,\r\n[but] the Act does not apply to a private 501(c)(3) corporation like the Alliance.\"  The court\r\nconcluded it need not reach the issue of whether the challenged conduct violated the State Ethics\r\nAct as \"any declaratory judgment would constitute an impermissible 'advisory opinion.'\"  The\r\ncourt further stated the \"Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy this Court that relief by way of a\r\npermanent injunction is needed.\"  The court based this conclusion on the fact that  \"[n]othing\r\nremains to be enjoined.  No contract remains to be construed.  The disputed Radiology Contract\r\nhas expired.\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that any issue regarding the violation of the State Ethics Act is now\r\nmoot because the Alliance is no longer a governmental entity, and therefore any declaration that\r\nthe actions taken by RMH violated the State Ethics Act would be advisory in nature.  We also find\r\nno exception to the mootness doctrine that would apply to this set of facts, as the Alliance is a\r\nprivate entity and not subject to the State Ethics Act.\r\n\r\nLikewise, we find that the request for a permanent injunction is no longer viable as the disputed\r\ncontract has now expired, and thus there is nothing for the court to enjoin.  Additionally, we find\r\nthat there is no exception to the mootness doctrine that would be applicable because the language\r\nin the complaint seeking the permanent injunction specifically sought to enjoin the institution of\r\nthe Radiology contract and proposed duty rotation schedule then in existence.\r\n\r\nIII.  Dismissal of Waldron's causes of action\r\n\r\nWaldron finally contends the trial court caused prejudice, in the form of collateral estoppel, by\r\ndenying him a jury trial, proceeding to make findings of fact and conclusions of law without\r\ngiving him the opportunity to make his record, denying his motion for a stay, and dismissing the\r\naction with prejudice.\r\n\r\nTo the extent Waldron is arguing he should have been awarded \r\n  a jury trial, we find this issue is not properly before us. Our supreme court \r\n  has held that orders concerning the mode of trial affect substantial rights \r\n  as provided under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976) and must be appealed immediately. \r\n  Lester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 266, 491 S.E.2d 240, 241 (1997). Thus, \r\n  where a party fails to immediately appeal an order designating the case as a \r\n  non-jury matter, it acts as a waiver of the right to appeal that issue and a \r\n  subsequent appeal is barred. Id.; see also Foggie v. CSX Transp., \r\n  313 S.C. 98, 103, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993) (\"Issues regarding mode of trial \r\n  must be raised in the trial court at the first opportunity, and the order of \r\n  the trial court is immediately appealable.&quot;).\r\n\r\nWaldron also argues he was prejudiced because he was not able to fully present his case before the\r\ntrial court dismissed the three claims with prejudice.  Based on our holding above, we need not\r\nfurther address the trial court's dismissal of Waldron's first three claims.  We agree with Waldron\r\nthat the cause of action for breach of contract should be heard on its merits.  As to the remaining\r\ncauses of action, there is no evidence in the record as to the current status of these claims, but we\r\nfind the court's dismissal could have no direct effect on the remaining claims, especially in light\r\nof our partial reversal and remand.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the trial court's dismissal of Waldron's requests for a declaratory judgment regarding\r\nthe State Ethics Act and a permanent injunction.\r\n\r\nHowever, we reverse the trial court's denial of the motion to amend to add the Alliance as a party\r\nand the dismissal of the claim for breach of contract, and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.   The court noted this action is one of four pending lawsuits that involved the various parties.\r\n2. Kester Freeman is the CEO of Palmetto\r\nHealth Alliance and the former president and CEO of RMH.                    \r\n  \r\n3.  Bayard was first appointed the Professional \r\n  Director of the Department of Radiology in 1989, and has served in this position \r\n  under successive contracts.  \r\n4.    Shah \r\n  and Sun were also originally parties to this action. Sun settled all claims \r\n  prior to the filing of RMH's motion to dismiss, and Shah settled during the \r\n  pendency of this appeal. \r\n5.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-13-700(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2001) (\"No public official, public member, or public employee may knowingly \r\n  use his official office, membership, or employment to obtain an economic interest \r\n  for himself . . . or a business with which he is associated.\"); S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 8-13-775 (Supp. 2001) (\"A public official, public member, or public employee \r\n  may not have an economic interest in a contract with the State or its political \r\n  subdivisions if the public official, public member, or public employee is authorized \r\n  to perform an official function relating to the contract.\"). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3498","title":"Tatnall v.

He initially pled guilty \r\n  to resisting arrest-assault on officer and was sentenced to five years in prison. \r\n  In addition, Lee pled guilty to assault and battery with intent to kill (&quot;ABIK&quot;). \r\n  He was sentenced to ten years, suspended upon the service of five years probation. \r\n  The judge ordered the probation to begin \"upon  [Lee's] release from \r\n  sentence now serving [for resisting arrest], to include any early release program/supervision.\" \r\n  Lee was paroled. Soon after, Lee violated his probation and the judge revoked \r\n  three years of the original ten year suspended sentence, converted the restitution \r\n  owed to a civil judgment, and terminated probation. Lee appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn October 1996, Lee was indicted with resisting arrest-assault \r\n  on officer. In June 1997, Lee was indicted for ABIK and possession of a weapon \r\n  during the commission of a violent crime. On December 3, 1997, Lee pled guilty \r\n  to the resisting arrest charge and was sentenced to five years in prison. The \r\n  next day, Lee pled guilty to the ABIK charge and was sentenced to ten years, \r\n  suspended upon the service of five years probation. The possession charge was \r\n  nol prossed. In its Probation Order, the court ruled Lee's probation \"[b]egins \r\n  upon release from sentence now serving, to include any early release program/supervision.\" \r\n  Lee did not appeal his convictions or sentences.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 2000, Lee was paroled on his resisting arrest \r\n  conviction. Pursuant to the December 4, 1997 probation order, Lee's probation \r\n  on his ABIK conviction started on March 29, 2000. Lee was on parole and probation \r\n  at the same time, each with the standard conditions, such as maintaining suitable \r\n  employment, and the special conditions of intensive supervision with electronic \r\n  monitoring, participation in a substance abuse program, random drug screening, \r\n  and attendance at a mental health program. Further, Lee was required to pay \r\n  restitution, fines, supervision fees, and the electronic monitoring fee. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 2000, Lee was charged with violating: (1) various \r\n  conditions of his parole; and (2) various conditions of his probation. Five \r\n  days later, Lee was served with both warrants. In August 2000, he appeared at \r\n  a parole violation hearing before the South Carolina Board of Probation, Parole \r\n  and Pardon Services (\"the Board\"). The Board found Lee had violated six conditions \r\n  of his parole and continued Lee on parole with additional conditions of supervision. \r\n  Almost one month after his parole violation hearing, Lee appeared at a probation \r\n  violation hearing. The circuit judge concluded Lee had willfully violated the \r\n  conditions of his probation. He revoked three years of the original ten year \r\n  suspended sentence, converted the restitution owed to a civil judgment, and \r\n  terminated probation. \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Circuit Court abuse its discretion in revoking \r\n    Lee's probation?\r\n     \r\n  Did the Circuit Court have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    to revoke Lee's probation? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis Court will not disturb the Circuit Court's decision \r\n  to revoke probation unless the decision was influenced by an error of law, was \r\n  without evidentiary support, or constituted an abuse of discretion. State \r\n  v. Archie, 322 S.C. 135, 470 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1996); see also \r\n  State v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 135, 61 S.E.2d 754 (1950) (stating that \r\n  upon review of revocation of probation, question is not one of formal procedure \r\n  respecting either notice, specifications of charges or trial thereon, but is \r\n  simply whether trial court abused its discretion; review therefore must be determined \r\n  in accordance with principles governing exercise of judicial discretion). The \r\n  decision to revoke probation is addressed to the discretion of the circuit judge. \r\n  White, 218 S.C. at 134-35, 61 S.E.2d at 756; State v. Proctor, \r\n  345 S.C. 299, 546 S.E.2d 673 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. Hamilton, 333 \r\n  S.C. 642, 511 S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1999). A reviewing court will only reverse \r\n  this determination when it is based on an error of law or a lack of supporting \r\n  evidence renders it arbitrary or capricious. Proctor, 345 S.C. at 301, 546 S.E.2d \r\n  at 674. The court has much discretionary authority in dealing with guilty persons \r\n  who are in a probationary status. Shannon v. Young, 272 S.C. 61, 248 \r\n  S.E.2d 914 (1978).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Revocation of Probation\r\n\r\nThis issue may not be preserved for review. At the probation \r\n  revocation hearing, Lee noted the prior parole revocation hearing and the Board's \r\n  decision to continue him on parole. However, he did not argue the Board's decision \r\n  somehow bound the Circuit Court to make a like decision in the probation matter. \r\n  Rather, Lee conceded several probation violations and offered explanations for \r\n  his failure to comply with the conditions. An issue must be raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review. State v. Perez, \r\n  334 S.C. 563, 514 S.E.2d 754 (1999); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, \r\n  401 S.E.2d 168 (1991).\r\n\r\nLee contends that the \"circuit judge abused his discretion \r\n  and that the decision to revoke his probation was arbitrary and capricious.\" \r\n  In his brief, he argues:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The violations alleged in the violation of probation arrest \r\n    warrant issued on May 4, 2000 were identical to the violations alleged in \r\n    the violation of parole arrest warrant issued that same date.â€¦ \r\n\r\n  . . . \r\n\r\n  We are now faced with a Circuit Court and a Parole Board, \r\n    whose functions are virtually identical in the area of determining whether \r\n    a criminal defendant should be allowed to serve his or her sentence outside \r\n    of the walls of our prison system, each reaching a different decision on the \r\n    same alleged facts. It is the Appellant's contention that the Circuit Court's \r\n    decision to revoke his probation, after a thorough review of the facts by \r\n    the Parole [B]oard determined no revocation was warrant[ed], was an abuse \r\n    of discretion, was arbitrary and capricious, and warrants a reversal by this \r\n    Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find Lee's argument is meritless. In the absence of capricious \r\n  or arbitrary exercise, the discretion of the court in revoking probation will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal. State v. McCray, 222 S.C. 391, 73 S.E.2d \r\n  1 (1952). Revocation of probation, in whole or in part, is the means of enforcement \r\n  of the conditions of the probation. Id.; see also State \r\n  v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 61 S.E.2d 754 (1950) (stating that on review of \r\n  revocation of probation, question is not one of formal procedure respecting \r\n  either notice, specifications of charges or trial thereon, but is simply whether \r\n  trial court abused its discretion and must be determined in accordance with \r\n  principles governing exercise of judicial discretion, which implies conscientious \r\n  judgment, not arbitrary action, takes account of law and particular circumstances, \r\n  and is directed by judge's reason and conscience to just result); State v. \r\n  Archie, 322 S.C. 135, 470 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding this Court \r\n  will not disturb circuit court's decision to revoke probation unless decision \r\n  was influenced by error of law, was without evidentiary support, or constituted \r\n  abuse of discretion). The court has much discretionary authority in dealing \r\n  with guilty persons who are in a probationary status. Shannon v. Young, \r\n  272 S.C. 61, 248 S.E.2d 914 (1978).\r\n\r\n\"Probation is a matter of grace; revocation is the means \r\n  to enforce the conditions of probation.\" State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. \r\n  642, 648, 511 S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing McCray and State \r\n  v. White). However, the authority of the revoking court should always be \r\n  predicated upon an evidentiary showing of fact tending to establish a violation \r\n  of the conditions. Id. (citing White and State v. Miller, \r\n  122 S.C. 468, 115 S.E. 742 (1923)). Thus, before revoking probation, the circuit \r\n  judge must determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish the probationer \r\n  has violated his probation conditions. Id. at 648-49, 511 S.E.2d at 97. \r\n  Once the determination is made that a probationer has violated the conditions \r\n  of his probation, the circuit judge can require the probationer to serve all \r\n  or a portion of the sentence originally imposed. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-460 \r\n  (1989).\r\n\r\nAt the probation revocation hearing, Lee admitted violating \r\n  several conditions of his probation including: (1) failing to pay supervision \r\n  fees; (2) failing to pay restitution; (3) failing to comply with substance abuse \r\n  treatment; and (4) failing to comply with electronic monitoring. Defense counsel \r\n  claimed that, despite these violations, \"locking [Lee] back up\" was not the \r\n  solution to Lee's problems. Instead, defense counsel asked the court to restructure \r\n  Lee's financial obligations and continue him on probation. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the Board chose to continue Lee on parole \r\n  as a result of his parole violations has no bearing on the Circuit Court's decision \r\n  regarding his concomitant probation violations. In any event, the Board and \r\n  the Circuit Court judge were entirely consistent in finding Lee had violated \r\n  the conditions of his supervision. Only their actions in response to the violations \r\n  were different.\r\n\r\nLee admittedly violated numerous conditions of his probation. \r\n  There was a sufficient factual basis to support the revocation. Thus, the judge \r\n  did not abuse his discretion in revoking Lee's probation.\r\n\r\nII. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nLee argues the Circuit Court did not have subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction in this matter. He asserts \"there is â€¦ no authority given the Circuit \r\n  Court to place a defendant on both probation and parole at the same time. The \r\n  statute clearly envisions the situation where a defendant completes his sentence \r\n  and then begins his probation. Otherwise you have the situation facing [Lee] \r\n  whereby he must answer to both the Parole Board and the circuit court for the \r\n  same conduct.\" This assertion has no merit.\r\n\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction to revoke an individual's probation \r\n  is conferred on the General Sessions Court by either the issuance of a probation \r\n  violation warrant or the issuance of a probation violation citation and affidavit \r\n  in lieu of a warrant. State v. Felder, 313 S.C. 55, 437 S.E.2d 42 (1993); \r\n  State v. Hutto, 252 S.C. 36, 165 S.E.2d 72 (1968); see also S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 (Supp. 2001) (requiring issuance of probation revocation \r\n  warrant before probation may be revoked); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-300 (Supp. \r\n  2001) (permitting use of written citation and affidavit in lieu of warrant; \r\n  issuance of citation or warrant during period of supervision gives jurisdiction \r\n  to court and Board at any hearing on violation).\r\n\r\nHere, Lee's five year probationary period was ordered to \r\n  begin \"upon release from sentence now serving, to include any early release \r\n  program/supervision.\" On March 29, 2000, Lee was granted parole on the sentence \r\n  he was serving. Therefore, his probationary period began on March 29, 2000. \r\n  On May 4, 2000, during the five year probationary period, the arrest warrant \r\n  for violation of probation was issued. On May 9, 2000, Lee was served with the \r\n  arrest warrant for probation violation. This warrant thus conferred subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction upon the court. \r\n\r\nLee argues the Circuit Court had no authority to order a \r\n  sentence such as the one he received for ABIK. However, the statutory authority \r\n  of the sentencing court to issue the underlying sentence could have been challenged \r\n  in a motion to reconsider the sentence, on direct appeal, or as a defense to \r\n  the probation revocation proceedings. Lee made no such challenge. Thus, the \r\n  sentence is the law of the case, and any lack of authority does not affect the \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to later proceed with the revocation. \r\n  See State v. Sampson, 317 S.C. 423, 454 S.E.2d 721 (1994) (holding \r\n  unappealed ruling is the law of the case).\r\n\r\nWe distinguish this case from State v. Proctor, 345 \r\n  S.C. 299, 546 S.E.2d 673 (Ct. App. 2001). Proctor appealed the order finding \r\n  him in violation of probation. He was originally sentenced to five years under \r\n  the Youthful Offender Act (\"YOA\") for a grand larceny conviction, and he received \r\n  suspended sentences for both burglary and arson. His probation order for the \r\n  burglary conviction stated, \"the conditions of probation begin after YOA case.\" \r\n  Id. at 300, 546 S.E.2d at 674. His probation order for the arson conviction \r\n  stated, \"the conditions of probation begin after active YOA.\" Id. While \r\n  serving the five year sentence, Proctor was conditionally released from incarceration. \r\n  At his probation revocation hearing, the trial judge ruled the period of probation \r\n  began upon Proctor's conditional release from the YOA sentence and ran concurrently \r\n  with the YOA conditional release. In reversing, this Court found that Proctor \r\n  was still serving his YOA sentence while on conditional release. Id. \r\n  at 303, 546 S.E.2d at 675. Upon his unconditional release by the Division, Proctor \r\n  will begin to serve his probationary terms as provided in the probation orders. \r\n  Id. at 303, 546 S.E.2d at 675-76. In the present case, the probation \r\n  was to begin upon Lee's \"release from the sentence now serving, to include any \r\n  early release program/supervision.\" Thus, probation would begin when he was \r\n  released from incarceration. In Proctor, however, the probation began \r\n  after Proctor's unconditional release from the YOA offense, which did not coincide \r\n  with his release from incarceration because that was only a conditional release \r\n  from the YOA sentence.\r\n\r\nA sentencing judge has the authority to order a probationary \r\n  period to begin upon a defendant's release from incarceration on a separate \r\n  charge, even if that release is the result of the defendant being paroled. Section \r\n  24-21-410 provides: \"After conviction or plea for any offense, except a crime \r\n  punishable by death or life imprisonment, the judge of a court of record with \r\n  criminal jurisdiction at the time of sentence may suspend the imposition or \r\n  the execution of a sentence and place the defendant on probation or may impose \r\n  a fine and also place the defendant on probation. Probation is a form of clemency.\" \r\n  Additionally, \"[t]he period of probation or suspension of sentence \r\n  shall not exceed a period of five years and shall be determined by the \r\n  judge of the court and may be continued or extended within the \r\n  above limit.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-440 (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added). Sections \r\n  24-21-410 and 24-21-440 vest the sentencing judge with broad authority to determine \r\n  the beginning date of a term of probation, so long as the term of the probation \r\n  does not exceed five years. Because the probation did not exceed five years, \r\n  there was no error by the Circuit Court.\r\n\r\nLee argues there is no authority given to the court to place \r\n  a defendant on probation and parole at the same time. In the present case, the \r\n  sentencing court only placed Lee on probation, not on parole. He was paroled \r\n  by the Board in an appropriate exercise of its discretion. See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 24-21-610 to -710 (1989 &amp; Supp. 2001) (relating to parole and release \r\n  for good conduct). Parole eligibility is not a matter within the jurisdiction \r\n  of the trial court, but falls within the province of the Board of Probation, \r\n  Parole, and Pardon Services. Brown v. State, 306 S.C. 381, 412 S.E.2d \r\n  399 (1991) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-610 (1989)). Thus, the probation revocation \r\n  was proper, as it was a separate and distinct function from that of the Board.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the order of the \r\n  Circuit Court is \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n\r\nCURETON, J., and THOMAS, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3500","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAlma Mendez was separated from her husband, Cabrera. They \r\n  had a two-year-old daughter, Melissa. On the evening of June 30, 1999, Alma, \r\n  Melissa, and friends Raphael Gonzalez, Jr., Vicente Cazeros, Elke Wagner, and \r\n  Wagner's six-year-old son, Christopher, ate a late dinner at an Applebee's in \r\n  Spartanburg County. In the middle of their dinner, Cabrera appeared in the restaurant. \r\n  Cabrera approached Alma's table and spoke to her. The two were soon outside \r\n  arguing. Alma later came back as Cabrera left. Alma reported to her dinner companions \r\n  that Cabrera was upset about their separation and wanted her back. Alma reported \r\n  that she did not want anything more to do with Cabrera.\r\n\r\nThe party left the restaurant as it began closing around \r\n  midnight. As she was getting into Gonzalez's extended cab pickup, Alma spotted \r\n  Cabrera's van in the parking lot of an adjacent business. Cabrera flashed his \r\n  lights and Alma went over to the van. Within several minutes, she walked back \r\n  to her group with Cabrera following several strides behind her. Alma motioned \r\n  to the others that Cabrera had a handgun tucked under his waistband.\r\n\r\nCabrera announced to the group that Alma and Melissa were \r\n  leaving with him. Alma said she and her daughter were not going anywhere with \r\n  him. Cabrera called for Melissa, and Melissa got out of the truck and into Cabrera's \r\n  arms. Gonzalez and Wagner tried to defuse the situation by telling Cabrera that \r\n  since they had brought Alma and Melissa to the Applebee's, they would take her \r\n  home. Cabrera instructed Gonzalez and Wagner to stay out of his family's dispute. \r\n  Alma grabbed Melissa from Cabrera. Cabrera then took the gun from his waistband \r\n  and pointed it at Alma. Alma put her hand on his wrist and attempted to push \r\n  the gun down. Cabrera pulled his hand back, pointed the gun at Alma, and fired. \r\n  Alma, who was still holding Melissa, sustained a gunshot to her right eye and \r\n  was killed. As Alma fell with Melissa to the ground, Gonzalez, Wagner, and Cazeros \r\n  raced to aid the two. Cabrera pointed his gun at all three; however, he did \r\n  not fire the weapon. Instead, he ran back to his van and drove away.\r\n\r\nSpartanburg County Sheriff's Department officers arrested \r\n  Cabrera within hours. He was taken to the Spartanburg County Detention Center, \r\n  where investigators with the Spartanburg Department of Public Safety began an \r\n  interrogation. Cabrera is a foreign-born Hispanic; thus, in an abundance of \r\n  caution, the police brought in Tony Membreno, a public safety officer fluent \r\n  in Spanish, to interpret for Cabrera. (1) Cabrera \r\n  was read his Miranda rights in English by Detective Michael Morrow and \r\n  Spanish by Officer Membreno. As Officer Membreno attempted to ascertain whether \r\n  Cabrera understood his rights, Cabrera stated: \"I'm guilty. I fully accept everything \r\n  that had happened and I'm responsible for it.\" Cabrera then signed a waiver \r\n  form, orally recounted the details of the crime, and later repeated his confession \r\n  in a written statement. The oral statement was taped.\r\n\r\nCabrera was indicted for Alma's murder, possession of a \r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and three counts of pointing \r\n  and presenting a firearm. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial judge err by refusing to admit self-serving \r\n      portions of Cabrera's written statement into evidence during Cabrera's cross \r\n      examination of a police officer about oral statements he made to the officer \r\n      during custodial interrogation?\r\n      \r\n    Did the trial judge err by refusing to permit Cabrera's \r\n      attorney to resume his representation of Cabrera following Cabrera's decision \r\n      to terminate counsel?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Admissibility of Cabrera's Self-Serving Written \r\n    Statement  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCabrera argues the circuit judge erred in preventing him \r\n  from introducing a self-serving portion of his written statement while cross \r\n  examining Officer Membreno about oral statements he made to the officer during \r\n  custodial interrogation. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAfter being read his Miranda rights by Detective \r\n  Morrow in English and by Officer Membreno in Spanish, Cabrera indicated that \r\n  he understood. Cabrera gave an oral statement to Officer Membreno concerning \r\n  the events surrounding the shooting and confessed to killing Alma. His statement \r\n  was recorded on audiocassette and Cabrera reduced his statement to writing. \r\n  In the written statement, Cabrera indicated Alma took the gun from him and the \r\n  gun \"went off\" when he grabbed it back from her.\r\n\r\nDuring the Jackson v. Denno hearing, the solicitor \r\n  moved to have the oral statement given to Officer Membreno introduced under \r\n  Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE as an admission of a party-opponent. Arguing that Cabrera's \r\n  self-serving written statements were hearsay, the solicitor moved to exclude \r\n  the self-serving portions of the statement from introduction through the testimony \r\n  of Officer Membreno. The solicitor did not want to introduce the tape recording \r\n  of the statement or the written statement. Noting that the written statement \r\n  contained some self-serving statements, the court ruled that if any of the document \r\n  was introduced, then the entire document, including the self-serving statements, \r\n  must be introduced pursuant to the completeness theory. The solicitor informed \r\n  the court that she did not plan to introduce the written statement, but she \r\n  would introduce the oral statements made to the police officer through the officer's \r\n  testimony.\r\n\r\nDuring direct examination, Officer Membreno recounted Cabrera's \r\n  oral statement in which Cabrera described the details of the evening of the \r\n  shooting. On cross examination, Cabrera, proceeding pro se, attempted \r\n  to ask Officer Membreno about the written statement and wanted him to read it. \r\n  The court asked the parties to approach the bench. The following discussion \r\n  occurred out of the hearing of the jury:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Solicitor: And he wants [Officer Membreno] to read parts \r\n    of it?\r\n\r\n   Before the officer reads, you know, I think that he is \r\n    going to have to offer this into evidence. Certainly at that point I would \r\n    renew my objection to introduction of this officer of any statements. Basically \r\n    I think -\r\n\r\n  The Court: The State has objected to any statement that \r\n    was made by you that tends to be in your favor. You may remain silent or you \r\n    may tell the jury about this, but you may not ask this witness about this \r\n    statement, this part of it.\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: Why can't I?\r\n\r\n  The Court: You either have to testify or remain silent. \r\n    If you are permitted to ask him to read this part of the statement, then you \r\n    are testifying through another witness, which is not permitted. Do you understand?\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: It's the same thing that I said that I signed. \r\n    It's the same thing.\r\n\r\n  The Court: You may testify or you may remain silent, but \r\n    you may not ask this witness what you said to defend yourself. The judge then \r\n    excused the jury and read the portion of the written statement Cabrera wished \r\n    to discuss into the record: \"I don't know how she took the gun out of my pants \r\n    pocket. I tried to grab and force her, but the gun went off and fired.\" The \r\n    court found the statement was self-serving and not a proper question to ask \r\n    on cross examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial continued. During deliberations, the jury requested \r\n  and received the manslaughter and murder instructions. Three hours later, the \r\n  jury indicated it had reached a verdict on the firearms offense, but not on \r\n  the murder or manslaughter offense. The judge gave the jury an Allen \r\n  charge. An hour later, the jury again requested an instruction on the distinction \r\n  between murder and manslaughter, and the judge charged the jury on both offenses. \r\n  Nearly two hours later, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.\r\n\r\nCabrera argues that excluding the portion of his written \r\n  statement about the gun going off during a struggle with Alma was unfair. \r\n\r\nA. Rule 106, SCRE Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 106, SCRE, provides: \r\n\r\n  When a writing, or recorded statement, \r\n    or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the \r\n    introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded \r\n    statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with \r\n    it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\n\"In interpreting the language of a court rule, we apply \r\n  the same rules of construction used in interpreting statutes. Therefore, the \r\n  words of [the rule] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort \r\n  to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the rule.\" State v. Brown, \r\n  344 S.C. 302, 306, 543 S.E.2d 568, 570 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Green v. \r\n  Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. 303, 304, 443 S.E.2d 906, 907 (1994)).\r\n\r\nIn construing the parameters of Rule 106, SCRE, our Supreme \r\n  Court has looked to Rule 106 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The common-law \r\n  doctrine of completeness has been partially codified in Rule 106 of the Federal \r\n  Rules of Evidence. United States v. Wilkerson, 84 F.3d 692, 696 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1996) (citing Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, \r\n  488 U.S. 153, 171-72, 109 S. Ct. 439, 450-51, 102 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1988)). The \r\n  rule applies only to writings or recorded statements, not to conversations. \r\n  Id. (citing Fed.R.Evid. 106, advisory committee notes and United \r\n  States v. Bigelow, 914 F.2d 966 (7th Cir.1990), cert. \r\n  denied, 498 U.S. 1121, 111 S. Ct. 1077, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1182 (1991) \r\n  (emphasis added). In State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998), \r\n  the Court noted Rule 106, Fed.R.Evid. is based on the \"rule of completeness\" \r\n  and \"seeks to avoid the unfairness inherent in 'the misleading impression created \r\n  by taking matters out of context.'\" Id. at 170, 508 S.E.2d at 875 (citations \r\n  omitted). Additionally,\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 106 [of the Federal Rules of Evidence] is a procedural \r\n    device governing the timing of completion evidence; the Rule is 'primarily \r\n    designed to affect the order of proof.' It means that the adverse party need \r\n    not wait until cross-examination or rebuttal. As such, the Rule reduces the \r\n    risk that a writing or recording will be taken out of context and that an \r\n    initial misleading impression will take hold in the mind of the jury. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted). \r\n\r\nAlthough Rule 106 is intended to clarify any misconceptions \r\n  the admission of a partial statement would give, \"[o]nly that portion of the \r\n  remainder of a statement which explains or clarifies the previously admitted \r\n  portion should be introduced.\" Id. at 171, 508 S.E.2d at 876 (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nThe actual recording of Cabrera's oral statement was not \r\n  admitted into evidence. Membreno did not mention in his testimony whether Cabrera's \r\n  oral statement contained the same self-serving statement as the written statement \r\n  regarding the struggle over the gun. The record before us only indicates that \r\n  Cabrera made the self-serving statement in the written \r\n  statement. As Rule 106 only applies to writings or recordings, we find no error \r\n  with the trial court's refusal to admit any self-serving portion of the oral \r\n  conversation Cabrera had with Membreno under a Rule 106 analysis.\r\n\r\nFurther, Cabrera only attempted to admit a portion of the \r\n  written statement, not any portion of the oral \r\n  statement. Because the written statement was never introduced, the trial judge \r\n  did not violate Rule 106 in prohibiting Cabrera from questioning Membreno regarding \r\n  the self-serving portions of the written statement. Rule 106, by its terms, \r\n  refers only to written or recorded \r\n  statements, not to conversations.\r\n\r\nB. State v. Jackson Analysis \r\n  \r\n\r\nBefore the South Carolina Rules of Evidence were adopted, \r\n  State v. Jackson, 265 S.C. 278, 217 S.E.2d 794 (1975), held that when \r\n  some of a conversation is placed into evidence, a party is entitled to \"prove \r\n  the remainder of the conversation, so long as it is relevant, particularly when \r\n  it explains or gives new meaning to the part initially recited.\" Id. \r\n  at 284, 217 S.E.2d at 797. Because the oral statement was introduced in totality, \r\n  the trial court complied with the rule in Jackson.\r\n\r\nC. State v. Terry Analysis \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Terry, 339 S.C. 352, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 882, 121 S. Ct. 197, 148 L. Ed. \r\n  2d 137 (2000), the Supreme Court held that a defendant who elected not to testify \r\n  in accordance with his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination \r\n  was not \"unavailable\" within the meaning of Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE. As a result, \r\n  the defendant could not introduce his confession, which suggested he was guilty \r\n  of manslaughter rather than murder, as a statement against penal interest. The \r\n  Court reasoned that the defendant was attempting to exculpate himself with his \r\n  confession and held that a defendant seeking to make exculpatory statements \r\n  must face cross examination unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicated \r\n  the trustworthiness of the statements. Id. at 356-57, 529 S.E.2d at 276-77.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Golson, Op. No. 3465 (S.C.Ct.App. filed \r\n  March 25, 2002) (Shearouse Adv.Sh. No. 8 at 65), the Court of Appeals analyzed \r\n  the admissibility of the defendant's exculpatory statement under the Terry \r\n  analysis. Unlike the scenario in Terry, Golson testified in his own defense. \r\n  Accordingly, Golson did not render himself unavailable as a witness by virtue \r\n  of the exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. \r\n  Moreover, the prosecution was afforded the opportunity to -- and did -- cross \r\n  examine Golson. Taking these circumstances into account, this Court found the \r\n  holding in Terry did not control the evidentiary issue in this \r\n  case. Id. at 73.\r\n\r\nCabrera did not testify. His reliance upon Golson \r\n  is misplaced because Golson testified in his own defense and was subjected to \r\n  cross examination. Cabrera falls squarely into the holding of State v. Terry.\r\n\r\nII. Trial Judge's Refusal to Permit \r\n  Cabrera to Recall His Attorney to Resume Once Counsel was Dismissed\r\n\r\nCabrera argues the trial judge erred in ruling that he could \r\n  not change his mind about proceeding pro se once he decided to dismiss \r\n  his attorney. We disagree.\r\n\r\nDuring pre-trial proceedings, Cabrera passed a letter to \r\n  the trial judge in which he announced his desire to terminate representation \r\n  by his attorney, Michael Morin. In the letter, Cabrera complained Morin failed \r\n  to review evidence in the case with him, failed to pursue plea alternatives, \r\n  and was not prepared for trial. He requested the appointment of another public \r\n  defender and a continuance. Cabrera's letter was read into the record. Morin \r\n  disputed Cabrera's claims regarding his preparation and the pursuit of a plea, \r\n  but added he likely could not represent Cabrera because an adversarial atmosphere \r\n  between the two had apparently arisen. Morin stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Morin: I feel that I am prepared to try this case. However, \r\n    I must also say that having had read this into the record, it may appear that \r\n    an adversarial situation has developed between my client and myself. And I \r\n    think it's important for me to put that to the court, having - I don't want \r\n    to go into all the things that I would deny in that record, but there is obviously \r\n    ethical violations that have been accused of me, as well as any honesty I \r\n    would have with my client. And while I am prepared to go forward, I think \r\n    -- I hate to say this, but that may create an adversarial position between \r\n    my client and myself.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Thank you[,] Mr. Morin. Ms. Stone, any response \r\n    or remarks?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her response, the solicitor strenuously argued against \r\n  a continuance due to a lack of due diligence by Cabrera to inform the court \r\n  of his concerns and the cost to the State if the trial was delayed. At the time \r\n  these proceedings occurred, the matter had been pending for nine \r\n  months:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Solicitor: Of course, it's never been brought to our attention \r\n    before this morning that the defendant wished to fire Mr. Morin. It's my understanding \r\n    from him that he didn't even realize that when we had the hearing earlier. \r\n    Mr. Morin represented him at a criminal domestic violence trial a month ago, \r\n    when I know for certain we discussed this date at that time. He represented \r\n    him at that trial. He had no problem with him at that point.\r\n\r\n  He has been in jail for approximately nine months. As he \r\n    stated, he doesn't have any money to hire a private attorney. And he hasn't \r\n    attempted to do that prior to this time.\r\n\r\n  While he's complaining about us pushing this case. Of course, \r\n    we have to consider things like defendants in jail. He has been denied bond. \r\n    And, of course, the seriousness of the charge, including the feelings of the \r\n    family that would like to put this to rest in their minds and hearts concerning \r\n    the death of their sister and the assertion of what happens to the children, \r\n    yes, we have tried to move this case. We have let the defense know that we \r\n    had it set on a trial. And as far as I know, he's told his client.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe judge denied Cabrera's motion for a continuance. He \r\n  then informed Cabrera of his options regarding representation and provided him \r\n  with time to carefully consider his decision:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Court: With regard to the motion of Mr. Cabrera to discharge \r\n    the services of his attorney. He has that right. He may do that, but he will \r\n    be representing himself, which is not advised and which is an unwise â€¦ and \r\n    an unhappy thing to do, because is not learned in the law or the procedures \r\n    of the court, and lawyers are supposed to speak for their clients.\r\n\r\n  If you were to discharge Mr. Morin, you would be speaking \r\n    for yourself, with no knowledge of the law or the procedures involved. So, \r\n    it's your decision whether you want to have Mr. Morin assist you and try this \r\n    case, or whether you wish to try the case and represent yourself.\r\n\r\n  Take your time. Take your time.\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Take your time and talk with Mr. Morin about \r\n    this. There is no -- there is no rush. Take your time and make a decision \r\n    as to whether you want Mr. Morin to represent you or whether you wish to represent \r\n    yourself.Following a recess, the court asked Cabrera for his decision:\r\n\r\n  The Court: Now, Mr. Cabrera, you have a right to remain \r\n    silent. You do not have to speak at all during the trial. \r\n\r\n  You have a right to confront the witnesses who may be called \r\n    to testify against you. If you wish to ask them any questions, you may ask \r\n    them questions yourself.\r\n\r\n  The court will instruct the jury that they cannot hold against \r\n    you the fact that you do not testify in your own behalf. The jurors would \r\n    be instructed that they couldn't talk about your maintaining your silence, \r\n    even when they considered your guilt or innocence in the jury room.\r\n\r\n  The court has denied your motion for continuance.\r\n\r\n  The case will go forward, as the State has prepared its \r\n    case and is ready to go forward.\r\n\r\n  You may have Mr. Morin represent you; you may represent \r\n    yourself; you may have Mr. Morin sit with you and assist you; or you may remain \r\n    silent throughout the trial; or you may, through [the interpreter], ask questions \r\n    of the State's witnesses on your own and represent yourself.\r\n\r\n  Do you understand your options?\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: Yes.\r\n\r\n  The Court: The court warns you in the strongest possible \r\n    measure that you should have an attorney to represent you in this matter. \r\n    However, you are entitled to represent yourself, if you choose to do so. Do \r\n    you understand?\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the instructions from the court, the trial was \r\n  recessed to give Cabrera the opportunity to further discuss his representation \r\n  with his attorney. \r\n\r\n\r\n  The Court: Mr. Morin, have you talked with your client about \r\n    his desire to have your representation, or otherwise?\r\n\r\n  Morin: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  The Court: What is his decision?\r\n\r\n  Morin: I do not know. He will have to --\r\n\r\n  The Court: The court will speak directly to Mr. Cabrera. \r\n    Mr. Cabrera, do you wish to have Mr. Morin represent you?\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: If I don't have any other opportunity or possibility, \r\n    yes.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Very well. Mr. Morin, you will continue in your \r\n    representation. You will have access to Mr. Cabrera. And if Mr. Morton is \r\n    available, to have him assist you further in more detail preparations.\r\n\r\n  Proceedings for the day were soon adjourned. The next morning, \r\n    Morin reported to the court that Cabrera had changed his mind regarding Morin's \r\n    continued representation of him. The court again stressed \r\n    to Cabrera that representation by an attorney in a criminal matter was critical \r\n    and that the judge was not in a position to assist him with his defense if \r\n    he terminated Morin. The judge further emphasized that the trial would go \r\n    forward regardless of whether Cabrera was represented:\r\n\r\n  The Court: Mr. Cabrera, you have the right to represent \r\n    yourself. It is extremely unwise for a person to represent himself or herself \r\n    in this court. There are dangers and there are pitfalls in your attempting \r\n    to represent yourself. The court under no circumstance is permitted to assist \r\n    you in your defense. That is to say, that if you are unaware of the procedural \r\n    requirements of the presentation of your case, you may not know what to do, \r\n    and no one will be able to advise you as to what the procedural requirements \r\n    are. Therefore, the court in the strongest possible terms again advises you \r\n    against representation of yourself.\r\n\r\n  However, you do have that right. It is an absolute right. \r\n    You may represent yourself, if you please. You may ask questions of the witnesses \r\n    called by the State.\r\n\r\n  You may assert your absolute right to silence and not testify \r\n    in your own defense. If you choose to testify, you may do so. If you choose \r\n    not to testify, the court will instruct the jury that you will have invoked \r\n    that right and the jury may, under no circumstances, hold that against you. \r\n    They could not even discuss your right to silence and the fact that you did \r\n    not testify in your own behalf while they were considering your guilt or innocence.\r\n\r\n  The caution of the court goes to your lack of knowledge \r\n    of the procedural requirements of a trial, particularly your probable lack \r\n    of knowledge of the law and the procedures of the trial.\r\n\r\n  So again, the Court advises you strongly and seriously to \r\n    reconsider your position.\r\n\r\n  What is your desire?\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: I can't represent my own person. I don't know the \r\n    laws and the rights. And I'm not able to permit that [Morin] represent me, \r\n    because I'm not content with his work.\r\n\r\n  Your Honor, you know the law and you know whether the case \r\n    will continue or not - - will go forward or not.\r\n\r\n  The Court: The case will go forward, whether you represent \r\n    yourself or whether Mr. Morin represents you.\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: Neither of the two.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Mr. Morin will sit with you at the request of \r\n    the court and answer any questions that you have. You may represent yourself.\r\n\r\n  This court again will not, may not, and cannot under any \r\n    circumstances advise you of your rights at any time during these proceedings. \r\n    Do you understand?\r\n\r\n  Cabrera: I just -- I don't want a trial. I don't want anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Cabrera's decision, the trial judge directed \r\n  Morin to remain with Cabrera throughout the trial to answer any questions by \r\n  Cabrera:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Court: [Cabrera] has elected to relieve you as his lawyer. \r\n    After the trial commences, he will not be able to change his mind.\r\n\r\n  One of the basic and most important reasons for an attorney, \r\n    as was told to you on yesterday â€¦ is to speak for you â€¦. It is important that \r\n    you not speak for yourself, unless you desire to do that. So you may not, \r\n    after the commencement of the trial, which is about to start, change your \r\n    mind and have Mr. Morin brought back into the case. This is an extremely important \r\n    decision for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCabrera continued to refuse Morin as an attorney during \r\n  the trial, but he argued that he was \"not participating\" in his trial and that \r\n  he did not know how to represent himself. \r\n\r\nCabrera argues the trial judge erred in ruling he could \r\n  not change his mind and request counsel during the trial. \r\n\r\n\"The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution \r\n  guarantee that a person brought to trial in any state or federal court must \r\n  be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be validly \r\n  convicted and punished by imprisonment.\" Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. \r\n  806, 807, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). This right may be waived. \r\n  State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999). \"While it is beyond \r\n  question that an accused may waive counsel and represent himself, it is the \r\n  responsibility of the trial judge to determine whether there has been an intelligent \r\n  and competent waiver.\" State v. Bateman, 296 S.C. 367, 369, 373 S.E.2d \r\n  470, 471 (1988) (citations omitted). Waiver may be accomplished by making an \r\n  intentional and voluntary relinquishment of this right. Id. A trial court, \r\n  however, must determine the waiver is the product of a knowing, voluntary, and \r\n  intelligent decision. State v. Boykin, 324 S.C. 552, 478 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).\r\n\r\nFurther, the defendant must be informed on the record of \r\n  the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation or the record must indicate \r\n  the defendant had sufficient background to understand the disadvantages of self-representation \r\n  before he waives his right to counsel. Id. \"While a specific inquiry \r\n  by the trial judge expressly addressing the disadvantages of a pro se \r\n  defense is preferred, the ultimate test is not the trial judge's advice but \r\n  rather the defendant's understanding.\" Wroten v. State, 301 S.C. 293, \r\n  294, 391 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1990). Where the trial judge fails to make a specific \r\n  inquiry informing the defendant of the perils of proceeding pro se, \"this \r\n  Court will look to the record to determine whether [the defendant] had sufficient \r\n  background or was apprised of his rights by some other source.\" Prince v. \r\n  State, 301 S.C. 422, 424, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990).\r\n\r\nThere is no right to hybrid representation in South Carolina. \r\n  State v. Stuckey, 333 S.C. 56, 508 S.E.2d 564 (1998); Foster v. State, \r\n  298 S.C. 306, 379 S.E.2d 907 (1989); State v. Sanders, 269 S.C. 215, \r\n  237 S.E.2d 53 (1977). \"Hybrid representation\" is representation which is \"partially \r\n  pro se and partially by counsel.\" State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, \r\n  43, 503 S.E.2d 747, 751 (1998). The right to counsel, once waived, is no longer \r\n  absolute. Id. at 44, 503 S.E.2d at 751. There is a presumption that a \r\n  defendant's post-trial request for the assistance of \r\n  counsel should not be refused. Id. However, \"there are times when the \r\n  criminal justice system would be poorly served by allowing the defendant to \r\n  reverse his waiver at the last minute particularly where delay would result.\" \r\n  Id.\r\n\r\nIn Reed, a defendant elected to proceed pro se \r\n  in his capital murder trial and was found guilty. On the evening before the \r\n  sentencing phase, the defendant asked that standby counsel be appointed as counsel. \r\n  The trial judge denied the request. Noting that the defendant's request occurred \r\n  during a continuing, and not separate, proceeding and that counsel was not prepared, \r\n  the Supreme Court found the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying \r\n  the defendant's request for re-appointment of counsel. Id. at 44, 503 \r\n  S.E.2d at 751.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the trial judge -- through a skilled \r\n  interpreter -- repeatedly explained to Cabrera: (1) that the trial would go \r\n  on despite his protestations; (2) that he had the right to represent himself \r\n  or have Morin continue with his representation; (3) that self-representation \r\n  was an unwise and disadvantageous route to take; and (4) once Cabrera came to \r\n  a decision regarding his representation, there would be no chance to have Morin \r\n  resume his representation later in the proceedings. On each of these occasions, \r\n  the court asked Cabrera if he understood what the court was saying. Every time \r\n  when asked, Cabrera responded in the affirmative. Clearly, Cabrera made a knowing \r\n  and intelligent waiver of counsel. \r\n\r\nThe timing of Cabrera's letter complaining about Morin's \r\n  representation is evidence of his desire not to go to trial. The trial judge \r\n  elected not to indulge Cabrera's attempt to delay the proceedings. This was \r\n  within the judge's discretion. See State v. Marshall, 260&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;323, \r\n  195 S.E.2d 709 (1973) (affirming trial judge's denial of a motion for continuance \r\n  because the defendant had not exercised due diligence in securing the presence \r\n  of a witness for trial).\r\n\r\nAllowing Cabrera to recall his attorney during the trial, \r\n  after he had specifically waived his right to counsel, would have impermissibly \r\n  resulted in hybrid representation. As the right to counsel is not absolute once \r\n  waived, the trial court was acting within its discretion in prohibiting hybrid \r\n  representation. Thus, the trial court could not permit Morin to resume his representation \r\n  of Cabrera later in the trial.\r\n\r\nFurther, unlike the defendant in Reed, Cabrera did \r\n  not specifically ask for the re-appointment of counsel. Cabrera's protestations \r\n  throughout the trial that he was not participating and that he did not know \r\n  how to represent himself amounted to expressions of dissatisfaction with the \r\n  legal system, not a request to withdraw his waiver of counsel. See State \r\n  v. Hyatt, 513 S.E.2d 90, 94 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;[T]o obtain relief \r\n  from a waiver of his right to counsel, a criminal defendant must move the court \r\n  for withdrawal of the waiver\"). The trial court committed no error in its ruling \r\n  that Cabrera could not \"change his mind\" regarding Morin's representation after \r\n  electing to terminate counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rule that Rule 106, by its terms, refers only to written \r\n  or recorded statements, not to conversations. \r\n  Further, the efficacy of Rule 106 is to prevent a party from misleading the \r\n  jury by allowing into evidence relevant portions of the excluded statement which \r\n  clarify or explain the portion already received. Here, Cabrera only \r\n  attempted to admit part of the written statement, not \r\n  any portions of the oral statement.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution \r\n  guarantee that a defendant in any state or federal court must be afforded the \r\n  right to assistance of counsel before the defendant can be validly convicted \r\n  and punished. Indubitably, this right may be waived; however, the trial judge \r\n  has the duty to determine whether there has been an intelligent and competent \r\n  waiver. Waiver is the intentional and voluntary relinquishment of this right. \r\n  The waiver must be the product of a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent decision. \r\n  A defendant must be informed on the record of the dangers and disadvantages \r\n  of self-representation or the record must indicate the defendant had sufficient \r\n  background to understand the disadvantages of self-representation before the \r\n  defendant waives the right to counsel.\r\n\r\nThis record is a paradigm of trial court inquiry as to all \r\n  facets of constitutional rights and waiver. Based on the foregoing, Cabrera's \r\n  conviction is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., and THOMAS, Acting Judge, concur. \r\n1.

Office of Appellate Defense, of\r\nColumbia, for appellant.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\nAssistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, Assistant Attorney General W.\r\nRutledge Martin; and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: A jury convicted Demarco Johnson of first-degree burglary, armed robbery,\r\nand two counts of kidnapping.  The trial judge sentenced Johnson on each offense pursuant to\r\nsection 17-25-45(A) of the South Carolina Code, (1) known as the \"Two-Strikes\" law, (2) to life\r\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole.   Johnson had a prior conviction for assault\r\nand battery with intent to kill and two prior convictions for attempted armed robbery.  On\r\nappeal, Johnson challenges the validity of section 17-25-45(A), claiming the statute violates\r\nthe doctrine of separation of powers and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. \r\nHe also contends the State failed to satisfy its burden of proving that he had been convicted of\r\nthe prior offenses.  We affirm. (3)\r\n\r\n1. We find no merit to Johnson's contention that his sentence \r\n  under section 17-25-45(A) violates the separation of powers doctrine because \r\n  it deprives the judiciary of \"all judicial discretion\" in the exercise of its \r\n  sentencing function. The supreme court basically settled this issue in State \r\n  v. De La Cruz, (4) a case that dealt with \r\n  a challenge on the same ground to another mandatory sentencing statute, S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(c) (Supp. 1989). (5) \r\n  In that case, the supreme court recognized judicial discretion in sentencing \r\n  is subject to statutory restriction without any violation of the separation \r\n  of powers doctrine. (6)\r\n\r\n2. We likewise find no merit to Johnson's contention that the application to him of the\r\nmandatory sentencing statute at issue here amounts to cruel and unusual punishment (7) because the facts and circumstances in this case  \"simply [are]\r\nnot the kind that warrant[ ] imposition of a life sentence without eligibility for parole.\"\r\n\r\nIn State v. Jones, (8) \r\n  our supreme court determined the life without parole sentence under the Two-Strikes \r\n  law of a defendant who was convicted of three counts of armed robbery and possession \r\n  of a firearm was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime \r\n  for which he was convicted. (9) The Jones \r\n  court considered the following three factors mentioned in Solem v. Helm \r\n  (10) in reaching its conclusion: (1) the gravity of the offense compared \r\n  to the harshness of the penalty, (2) the sentences imposed on other criminals \r\n  in the same jurisdiction, and (3) the sentences for the same crime in other \r\n  jurisdictions. (11)\r\n\r\nHere, few would argue that first-degree burglary, armed robbery, and kidnapping are anything\r\nother than grave offenses of the \"most serious\" nature. Indeed, the Two-Strikes law declares\r\nthem to be such. (12)  When considered along with Johnson's prior offenses, two of which were\r\nfor attempted armed robbery and one of which was for assault and battery with intent to kill,\r\nthe penalty of life without parole for each of the offenses for which Johnson was convicted is\r\nnot extreme. (13)  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the sentence that Johnson received is no different from a sentence that would be\r\nlevied on any other defendant convicted in South Carolina under similar circumstances.  The\r\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole that the trial court imposed on Johnson upon\r\nhis conviction for four \"most serious\" offenses is the same sentence as would be imposed on\r\nany other defendant with a record of convictions for one or more \"most serious\" offenses (14)\r\nand similarly convicted.\r\n\r\nRegarding the third factor, a life sentence under recidivist \r\n  laws for armed robbery, one of four \"most serious\" offenses for which the jury \r\n  convicted Johnson, is not, as the court recognized in Jones, \"unique \r\n  to South Carolina.\" (15)\r\n\r\n3.  Finally, we disagree with Johnson's contention that the State failed to satisfy its burden of\r\nproof that Johnson had been convicted of the prior offenses that triggered the Two-Strikes\r\nlaw.  The State proffered certified copies of court records showing that a Demarco Johnson\r\npled guilty in 1997 to two counts of attempted armed robbery and one count of assault and\r\nbattery with intent to kill. Johnson offered no evidence (16) to suggest he was not that Demarco\r\nJohnson.  Under these circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to show that Johnson and\r\nthe individual previously convicted were one and the same.

Rather than offer evidence that \r\n  he was not the Demarco Johnson in question, Johnson, through counsel, complained \r\n  about the State's failure to honor his request to furnish him with fingerprints \r\n  or a mug shot from 1997 showing that he was in fact the same individual who \r\n  had pled guilty to the two offenses that the State relied upon to trigger the \r\n  Two-Strikes law.

(1) We affirm in part, reverse \r\n  in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nLaFon LeGette (2) applied for a critical area permit to build a boat dock with\r\na roof and floating dock.  OCRM initially granted the permit, but the\r\nneighbors on both sides, Dorman and May, objected and requested a\r\ncontested case hearing because the proposed boat dock would crowd too\r\nclose to their existing docks and because the roof would impinge on their\r\nview.  Adams' lot is pie-shaped, with only 33 feet of water frontage, so any\r\ndock configuration will necessarily cross the extended property lines of the\r\nneighboring lots.\r\n\r\nThe ALJ reversed the OCRM staff's determination and denied \r\n  the permit because the dock (1) would obstruct navigation and create problems \r\n  with May's floating dock, (2) would cross extended property lines and no justification \r\n  was given for an exception to the general rule, (3) would rest on the mud bottom \r\n  at low tide, and (4) would diminish the use and enjoyment of neighboring lots. \r\n  He stated none of these grounds individually was significant enough to deny \r\n  the permit, but cumulatively they posed a serious problem. He ruled Regulation \r\n  30-12.A(2)(o), which requires that a lot have minimum water frontage of 50 feet \r\n  to qualify for a dock permit, was not applicable, since the lot was platted \r\n  prior to 1993. He did not directly rule on the issue of whether the dock roof \r\n  would seriously impact views, but his ruling as to diminishment and enjoyment \r\n  of neighboring lots effectively did so. He balanced the factors under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 48-39-150(A) to be considered in granting or denying a permit, which \r\n  was within his discretion. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Panel reversed the ALJ and reinstated the \r\n  grant of the permit. The Panel made its own findings of fact, on which it based \r\n  its legal conclusions that the purpose and policy of the Regulation would not \r\n  be undermined by granting the permit. The Panel concluded the ALJ incorrectly \r\n  interpreted \"navigation\" within the meaning of the regulations. \"It is the position \r\n  of OCRM that any navigational issues between docks is a private property owner \r\n  issue. It is not the policy of OCRM to police navigational disputes that should \r\n  be dealt with among the adjacent property owners.\" The Panel also found, based \r\n  on its own review of the record below, that the dock would not rest on the creek \r\n  bottom at normal low tide and that the dock as permitted would not diminish \r\n  the enjoyment or value of adjacent land owners. Finally, the Panel held that \r\n  OCRM was properly before it as a party on appeal. \r\n\r\n The circuit court reversed the Panel, holding that it applied \r\n  the wrong standard of review and improperly substituted its judgment for that \r\n  of the ALJ. Alternatively, the circuit court held the petition for review was \r\n  insufficient, and therefore the appeal should have been dismissed for lack of \r\n  jurisdiction, and OCRM was not properly a party on appeal, since it did not \r\n  appeal from the ALJ's order. The circuit court judge ruled the ALJ's interpretation \r\n  of all subsections of Regulation 30-12.A(2) at issue were supported by substantial \r\n  evidence, except subsection (o), which he held prohibited lots with less than \r\n  fifty feet of water frontage from having a dock. Thus, the circuit court reinstated \r\n  the ALJ's order as modified.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Standard of Review: Substantial Evidence Standard \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the parties acknowledge, the crucial and perhaps dispositive \r\n  issue in this appeal revolves around applying the correct standard of review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case involves appearances before four tribunals and \r\n  includes three levels of appellate review. . . . [T]he ALJ presided as the fact-finder \r\n  . . .

Â§ 1-23-610(D) (Supp. 2001).

Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, \r\n  306 (1981). The Panel cannot reweigh the facts or make findings of fact in accord \r\n  with its own view of the evidence. The Panel can validly reverse the ALJ based \r\n  on an error of law under this appellate standard or if his findings are not \r\n  supported by substantial evidence. The Panel stated the ALJ misinterpreted navigation \r\n  in the regulations to include issues between neighbors. Thus, that portion of \r\n  the Panel's order on OCRM policy underlying navigation and construing its regulation \r\n  was proper.\r\n\r\nAdams cites the recent cases of McQueen and Guerard, \r\n  both issued since the creation of the Administrative Law Judge Division (ALJD) \r\n  for the proposition that the Panel retains essentially a de novo standard of \r\n  review and may make its own findings based on its own review of the evidence. \r\n  McQueen&nbsp;v. S.C. Coastal Council, 329 S.C. 588, 496 S.E.2d 643 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998), rev'd 340 S.C. 65, 530 S.E.2d 628 (2000), vacated and remanded \r\n  by 533 U.S. __, 121 S. Ct. 2581 (2001) in light of Palazzolo v. Rhode \r\n  Island, 533 U.S. __, 121 S. Ct. 2448 (2001). Guerard v. Whitner, \r\n  276 S.C. 521, 280 S.E.2d 539 (1981). Initially, we note that the first is on \r\n  dubious legal footing and the second was decided well before the creation of \r\n  the ALJD.\r\n\r\nAdams misapprehends the operative date in these decisions.  The key date\r\nis not when the decisions were published but when the cases were heard\r\nbelow and what procedure they followed.  The ALJD was created by the\r\nRestructuring Act of 1993.  1993 Act No. 181, Â§Â§ 11-19 (eff. July 1,\r\n1993), 1993 S.C. Acts 1407, 1433-1448 (codified as amended at S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§Â§ 1-23-310 to -660 (Supp. 2001).)  Both of these cases, though\r\ndecided after the creation of the ALJD, were heard in the first instance by\r\nthe Board as a contested case, and hence retained the old standard of\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nUnder the applicable standard of review in cases heard by the ALJ, the\r\nBoard or Panel must affirm the ALJ if the findings are supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence, not based on the Panel's own view of the evidence. \r\nTo hold otherwise would contravene the clear mandate of Â§ 1-23-610(D)\r\nand render the ALJ process a superfluous nullity.\r\n\r\nI.  Interpretation of Regulation 30-12.A(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Adams challenges the interpretation and application of several\r\nsubsections of Regulation 30-12.A(2) (4) governing dock permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)  Docks . . . shall normally be limited to one structure per parcel and\r\nshall not impede navigation or restrict the reasonable public use of State\r\nlands and waters; . . .\r\n\r\n(n)  Docks must extend to the first navigable creek . . . and floating docks\r\nwhich rest upon the bottom at normal low tide will not normally be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n(o)  For lots platted and recorded after May 23, 1993, . . . [l]ots less than 50\r\nfeet wide are not eligible for a dock.\r\n\r\n(p)  No docks . . . should normally be allowed to be built closer than 20\r\nfeet from extended property lines. . . .  However, the Department may\r\nallow construction closer than 20 feet or over extended property lines\r\nwhere there is no material harm to the policies of the Act.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n(r)  Roofs on private docks will be permitted on a case-by-case basis, with\r\nconsideration given to the individual merits of each application.  Precedent\r\nin the vicinity for similar structures will be considered as well as the\r\npotential for impacting the views of others.  Roofs which have the potential\r\nto seriously impact views will not be allowed, while those that have\r\nminimal impact may be allowed. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12.A(2) (Supp. 2001)\r\n\r\nInitially, we address the circuit court's ruling that reversed \r\n  both the ALJ and the Panel's finding that Regulation 30-12.A(2)(o) is inapplicable \r\n  to this case because the lot in question was platted before 1993. By its clear \r\n  terms, this subsection is inapplicable to this lot and does not prohibit the \r\n  issuance of a dock permit in this case. See Brown at 414 (\"Where \r\n  the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according \r\n  to their literal meaning.\"). We therefore reverse the circuit court on this \r\n  issue.\r\n\r\nTurning to the difference in the construction and interpretation \r\n  of Regulation 30-12.A(2)(a), we note that while the ALJD is an independent entity, \r\n  it still functions as an arm of the agency for purposes of according the agency \r\n  deference in interpretation. \"'[T]he construction of a statute by the agency \r\n  charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration \r\n  and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.'\" Id. Moreover, \r\n  the Panel, in interpreting its regulations, may reverse the ALJ as a matter \r\n  of law and is entitled to deference on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe ALJ denied the permit at least partially on the finding that the dock\r\nwould obstruct navigation and create problems with the adjoining dock. \r\nThe Panel, in interpreting its own regulation, held that navigation, as\r\ncontemplated in the regulation, did not encompass problems between\r\nneighbors or conflict with nearby docks but only applied to impediments to\r\nthe general public's use of State waters.\r\n\r\nAdams argues that because May's floating dock, which is the primary one\r\nthat causes navigational problems, is not permitted, Adams' dock permit\r\nshould be evaluated as if it were not there.  The correct approach is to\r\nconsider this dock permit in light of what is actually there, as did the ALJ. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150(A) (Supp. 2001) provides that each permit\r\nmust be considered on its own merits.  The ALJ is confined to make his\r\ndecision on the record before him, as are we.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[J]udicial prudence dictates and our statute mandates that the record reflect\r\naccurately evidence which forms the basis of decisions independent of any\r\nconsideration to contemplated remedial action, the result thereof, or the\r\noccurrence of any other future event.  This requirement aborts the potential\r\nfor continuing controversy spawned by litigation of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaver v. S.C. Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 368, 375, \r\n  423 S.E.2d 340, 344 (1992). Thus, the illegality of May's dock is an issue for \r\n  another day.\r\n\r\nBecause the ALJ premised his denial on the confluence of factors, this case\r\nmust be remanded to the ALJD to reconsider his findings based on the\r\nOCRM Panel's interpretation and application of its own regulations. \r\nBecause we remand for reconsideration by the ALJD, we do not find it\r\nnecessary to address the other subsections of the regulation pertaining to\r\nwater access, resting on the mud bottom, extended property lines, or roofs\r\nand the impact on neighboring views.\r\n\r\nII.  Sufficiency of the Petition for Review\r\n\r\n\r\nAdams argues the circuit court erred in holding the petition for review\r\ninsufficiently set forth the legal grounds for appeal to confer jurisdiction. \r\nWe agree.  The applicable regulations for OCRM cases are 30-6 and 30-7,\r\nnot 61-72, which applies to DHEC matters. (5)  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n30-6 &amp; 30-7 (Supp. 2001).  Regulation 30-6 requires only a bare bones\r\npetition of basically the party's name and permit number.  Thus, this\r\npetition was sufficient.  Obviously, the SCACR do not apply in\r\nproceedings before the Panel, and the appeal process is much more\r\ninformal than court requirements. \r\n\r\nRespondents argue correctly that Regulations 30-6 and 30-7 \r\n  as currently written were not in effect at the time of this appeal. \r\n  (6) However, the requirements under the prior version for the petition \r\n  for review were substantively the same. Respondents argue that the S.C. Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act (APA) trumps agency-specific statutes. See Pringle \r\n  v. Builders Transp., 298 S.C. 494, 381 S.E.2d 731 (1989). This is true of \r\n  pre-existing agency-specific statutes where the two conflict, but it is not \r\n  true of statutes and regulations enacted since the APA. As Regulations 30-6 \r\n  and 30-7 were substantially amended after the passage of the APA, we must presume \r\n  some modification was intended and the action did not result in a futile act. \r\n  See TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 620, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 471, 476 (1998). \"In interpreting a regulatory amendment, we presume \r\n  a regulatory agency, in adopting an amendment to a regulation, intended to make \r\n  a change in the existing law.\" Converse at 55. The minimal petition for \r\n  review required under OCRM regulations is consistent with the purpose of providing \r\n  notice of the appeal.\r\n\r\nIII.  OCRM as a Party on Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdams argues that because OCRM did not appeal the ALJ's order, it\r\nshould not have been permitted to argue the agency's viewpoint or\r\ninterpretation of its regulations before the Panel or the circuit court on\r\nappeal.  Thus, Adams contends the Panel had no authority to interpret the\r\nmeaning of \"navigation\" at the appellate hearing.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nWhile OCRM did not appeal the ALJ's order, the agency remains \r\n  a party at all levels to represent the agency and its policy stance. While we \r\n  do not hold that the OCRM staff is a necessary party on appeal, we find it clearly \r\n  is a proper party. In Owen Steel, this court held that the agency was \r\n  not a necessary party to the appeal and was not required to be made a party \r\n  on appeal by statute. Owen Steel Co. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 281 S.C. 80, \r\n  84-85, 313 S.E.2d 636, 639 (Ct. App. 1984). \"In considering whether there is \r\n  a defect of parties, the distinction between necessary and proper parties is \r\n  crucial.\" Id. However, the agency may be a proper party on appeal, and \r\n  the APA requires an appellant to serve the agency with a copy of the petition \r\n  for review to ensure it has notice of any proceeding. Id. at 85-86, 313 \r\n  S.E.2d at 638. Upon notice, the agency may petition to be made a party to the \r\n  appeal. \"Except in unusual circumstances, we anticipate that such a motion would \r\n  be granted as a matter of course.\" Id.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, our supreme court has held that \"whether or not \r\n  additional parties are proper to a controversy is left to the sound discretion \r\n  of the Trial Judge subject to review by appeal.\" Robinson v. S.C. State Highway \r\n  Dep't, 241 S.C. 137, 141, 127 S.E.2d 286, 287 (1962). Applications to bring \r\n  in additional parties are ordinarily granted as a matter of course, especially \r\n  where to do so will not injure the other parties. Id. at 141, 127 S.E.2d \r\n  at 288. The Panel relies on reports of its staff. Clearly, the agency is charged \r\n  with administering its permitting regulations and is charged with \"insur[ing] \r\n  consistent permit evaluations by the Department.\" S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1.A(2)(b) \r\n  (Supp. 2001). Thus, we find no error in the Panel's and circuit court's decisions \r\n  to allow counsel for OCRM to present arguments as to the proper implementation \r\n  and interpretation of those regulations the agency is charged with administering. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdams argues that to define this term is beyond the Panel's statutory\r\nauthority on appeal.  We strongly disagree.  Moreover, even if OCRM was\r\nnot properly before the Panel on appeal, the Panel always has the ability to\r\ninterpret and define terms within its own regulations consistent with its\r\nenabling statute.  OCRM is charged with administering coastal zone\r\npermits and promulgating regulations governing construction in critical\r\nareas.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-50 (Supp. 2001).  Thus, the Panel did not\r\nexceed its authority in interpreting \"navigation\" and correcting the ALJ for\r\nan error of law under the standard of review as set forth in S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 1-23-610(D) (Supp. 2001). \r\n\r\nIV.  Constitutional Claims\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdams first raised the regulatory taking issue to the Panel and the due\r\nprocess and equal protection issues before this court.  Because none of\r\nthese constitutional arguments were presented to the ALJ, they are not\r\npreserved for appellate review and thus are not properly before us.  Adams\r\nargues that she made repeated requests for equal treatment at every level. \r\nThat is insufficient.  The legal theory on which she seeks to prevail must\r\nbe raised to and ruled upon by the ALJ.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit\r\ncourt sits as an appellate court.  Consequently, issues not raised to and\r\nruled on by the agency are not preserved for judicial consideration. \r\nLikewise, issues not raised to and ruled on by the ALJ are not preserved\r\nfor appellate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown at 417 (citations omitted). While it is true \r\n  that ALJs cannot rule on a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a regulation \r\n  or statute, ALJs can rule on whether a law as applied violates constitutional \r\n  rights. \"ALJs [cannot] rule on the validity of a statute. However, an agency \r\n  or ALJ can still rule on whether a party's constitutional rights have been violated. \r\n  . . . [M]erely asserting an alleged constitutional violation will not allow \r\n  a party to avoid an administrative ruling.\" Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, \r\n  18, 538 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2000) (also, claimant is not required to exhaust administrative \r\n  remedies when challenging the constitutionality of a statute).\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause the ALJ's factual findings are supported by substantial evidence\r\nin the record, the Panel erred in making its own findings of fact and\r\nreweighing the evidence.  Because the agency's interpretation of its\r\nregulations through the Panel and the ALJ is accorded deference, we adopt\r\nthe Panel's interpretation of navigation.  We hold that Regulation 30-12.A(2)(o) by its plain language does not apply.  The petition for review\r\nwas sufficient to confer jurisdiction under Regulations 30-6 and 30-7. \r\nOCRM remains a proper party before the Panel and the courts on appeal.\r\nBecause the ALJ accorded significant weight to his interpretation of\r\nnavigation under the regulations and stated that none of the subsections\r\nindividually was a substantial enough reason to deny the permit, we\r\nremand this case to the ALJD for determination of whether the permit\r\nshould issue in light of the Panel's interpretation of its own regulations.\r\n\r\nThe ALJ should evaluate the permit based on the records of the contested\r\ncase hearing below but also has discretion to take any additional evidence\r\nnecessary to this determination.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  The Panel was the governing board \r\n  of OCRM at all times pertinent to this appeal.  \r\n 2.  Appellant Adams is the land owner; \r\n  LeGette was a potential buyer, but the contract of sale had a condition that \r\n  the dock permit could be obtained. On appeal to the circuit court, LeGette sought \r\n  to withdraw from the litigation, and Adams moved to substitute as a party. The \r\n  circuit court denied the motion to substitute Adams for LeGette because it was \r\n  made just before hearing. This court granted her motion, and no exception has \r\n  been taken to that ruling.  \r\n3.  See also Jean Hoefer Toal \r\n  et al., Appellate Practice in S.C. (1999) 56-57 (\"The scope of review \r\n  of final ALJ decisions is essentially identical to the scope of review established \r\n  in section 1-23-380. This scope of review applies to the circuit court or the \r\n  applicable board or commission.\")  \r\n4.  Regulation 30-12 was substantially \r\n  rewritten, effective June 25, 1999. Judge Breeden's order is dated August 14, \r\n  1998. Because none of the changes are substantive but merely clarified the existing \r\n  regulation, we have cited to the current version. The changes are set forth \r\n  in 23 S.C. Reg., No. 6, 107 (June 25, 1999).  \r\n5.  Regulation 61-72 sets forth procedures \r\n  for contested cases, but the DHEC Board no longer hears contested cases. It \r\n  has numerous conflicts with the ALJD Rules and is of questionable validity in \r\n  light of the subsequent creation of the ALJD. The ALJs have generally held that \r\n  61-72 controls the time frames for appeal and related matters but that ALJD \r\n  Rules control once the ALJD has jurisdiction. Cf. Mictronics, Inc. \r\n  v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510, 548 S.E.2d 223, 225-26 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001) (ALJD Rules are applicable to proceedings before ALJ, not SCRCP.). \r\n6.  Regulations 30-6 and 30-7 were substantially \r\n  rewritten contemporaneously with Regulation 30-12.A, effective June 25, 1999, \r\n  to reflect the modified procedure for appeal after the creation of the ALJD. \r\n  See n. 2, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3503","title":"State v.

(1)\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1997, the victim (\"Victim\") left her boyfriend's \r\n  house between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. to meet friends. While en route, she received \r\n  a page from her boyfriend. Victim stopped at the nearest pay phone which was \r\n  located between a store and a post office. The area was dimly lit so she kept \r\n  her car lights on and parked within ten feet of the phone.\r\n\r\nWhen Victim parked, Heyward was using the phone. Victim \r\n  observed him for approximately two minutes as he used the phone. She also noticed \r\n  a mint green Honda with a front license plate depicting a rose on a black background. \r\n  Victim did not know Heyward. After Heyward finished using the phone, Victim \r\n  tried to call her boyfriend, but received no answer. When she turned around, \r\n  Victim saw Heyward sitting in her car holding the keys.\r\n\r\nHeyward asked Victim if he could take her for a ride. When \r\n  she declined, he pushed her to the ground and started beating her head and face, \r\n  telling her to shut up and let him take her for a ride. Victim momentarily broke \r\n  free from Heyward and tried to get back in her car, but Heyward grabbed her \r\n  from behind and began to choke her. He then dragged her and forced her into \r\n  his car, making her crawl from the driver's side to the passenger side. He told \r\n  Victim he was taking her for a ride \"to get some of [her] good stuff.\" As they \r\n  started to drive away in Heyward's car, Victim continued to protest and Heyward \r\n  told her to shut up or he was going to kill her.\r\n\r\nAfter traveling about seven-tenths of a mile, Victim remembered \r\n  that her aunt lived nearby. She escaped by opening the car door and jumping \r\n  from the car. She then ran to her aunt's house and called 911. A Charleston \r\n  County Sheriff's deputy took Victim's statement about her assailant, his car, \r\n  and the attack. Victim was bruised, her eye was swollen almost shut, and she \r\n  had cuts and scratches under her eye and on her arms.\r\n\r\nAnother deputy stopped a green Honda around 1:15 a.m. The \r\n  driver, Heyward, and the car fit the descriptions of the kidnapping earlier \r\n  that evening. When he looked into the car, he saw a gold earring on the passenger's \r\n  seat, a gold chain on the driver's seat, and another gold earring under the \r\n  passenger seat.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Victim identified Heyward as her assailant from \r\n  a photographic line-up of six men. Victim later went to the Charleston County \r\n  Sheriff's compound and identified the green Honda with the rose license plate. \r\n  She also identified a necklace, a stud earing, and a hoop earring found in the \r\n  car as jewelry she was wearing when abducted. Further investigation revealed \r\n  that a blood sample found on Heyward's shirt matched Victim's blood type.\r\n\r\nHeyward was indicted for ACSC and kidnapping. At trial, \r\n  in addition to charging the law on ACSC, the judge also charged the jury on \r\n  ABHAN. While defining ABHAN, the judge stated that \"[a]ggravated assault is \r\n  the unlawful and intentional infliction of injury upon a human being in sudden \r\n  heat and passion upon a sufficient legal provocation or when accompanied by \r\n  circumstances of aggravation.\" The jury convicted Heyward of kidnapping and \r\n  ACSC. The trial judge sentenced Heyward to life imprisonment for the ACSC charge \r\n  and thirty years for kidnapping. Heyward appeals the ACSC conviction.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nHeyward contends the trial judge erred in defining ABHAN \r\n  as including the element of sudden heat of passion upon a sufficient legal provocation. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Pilgrim, 326 S.C. 24, 482 S.E.2d 562 \r\n  (1997), our supreme court reversed a trial judge for equating ABHAN to voluntary \r\n  manslaughter because the comparison improperly added an additional element of \r\n  sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation. In this case, the \r\n  trial judge stated that \"[a]ggravated assault is the unlawful and intentional \r\n  infliction of injury upon a human being in sudden heat and passion upon \r\n  sufficient legal provocation or when accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.\" \r\n  (emphasis added). Thus, the trial judge's charge was improper.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, the improper charge was not harmless because \r\n  an ABHAN charge was required given the evidence presented at trial. Our supreme \r\n  court has held that ABHAN is a lesser included offense of ACSC. State v. \r\n  Elliott, 346 S.C. 603, 607-08, 552 S.E.2d 727, 729-30 (2001). ABHAN requires \r\n  an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation. \r\n  State v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 286, n. 2, 478 S.E.2d 871, 877, n. 2 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996). A trial judge must charge a lesser included offense if there \r\n  is any evidence from which it can be inferred that the defendant committed the \r\n  lesser included of the crime charged. State v. Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 32, \r\n  340 S.E.2d 784, 785 (1986).\r\n\r\nThe factual scenario presented in Drafts is strikingly \r\n  similar to that presented here. Like Heyward, Drafts was also indicted for kidnapping \r\n  and ACSC. The critical issue in Drafts was whether the trial judge erred \r\n  in failing to issue an ABHAN charge. Drafts coerced the victim into going for \r\n  a ride with him by showing her a knife. Once inside the vehicle, Drafts brandished \r\n  the knife and asked if she would \"give him a little bit\" and then asked her \r\n  to have oral sex with him. 288 S.C. at 33, 340 S.E.2d at 786. Drafts also kissed \r\n  the victim, touched her breasts and between her legs, and tried to place his \r\n  hands under her shirt. In his defense, although admitting taking indecent liberties \r\n  with the victim, Drafts claimed he did not want to do anything with her. On \r\n  these facts, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed, stating: \"If the jury \r\n  had believed appellant 'did not want to do anything' with the victim, they [sic] \r\n  could have concluded there was no attempted sexual battery and found him guilty \r\n  of ABHAN.\" 288 S.C. at 34, 340 S.E.2d at 786. Accordingly, the court held it \r\n  was error for the trial judge to refuse to charge ABHAN.\r\n\r\nThe dissent would find the erroneous charge harmless because \r\n  it believes Heyward's intentions, as expressed in the threat that he was going \r\n  \"to get some of [Victim's] good stuff\"were to rape Victim. Even though it appears, \r\n  based upon Heyward's allusion to Victim's \"good stuff\", that Heyward may have \r\n  intended to sexually assault her, that does not vitiate his entitlement to the \r\n  lesser included charge of ABHAN under the clear holding of Drafts. In \r\n  Drafts, the intentions of the defendant were even clearer than Heyward's- \r\n  in that case he asked the victim to \"give him a little bit\" and asked her to \r\n  perform oral sex. Moreover, Drafts' alleged statements were not the only evidence \r\n  of his intent. He also kissed the victim and touched her breasts. Nevertheless, \r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court found Drafts was entitled to an ABHAN charge. \r\n  Therefore, under existing case law governing lesser-included offenses and most \r\n  particularly under Drafts, we cannot isolate Heyward's single statement \r\n  concerning Victim's \"good stuff\" to the exclusion of the evidence that Heyward \r\n  was guilty only of ABHAN. As noted in State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, \r\n  265, 513 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1999), to warrant eliminating a lesser included offense \r\n  charge, it must \"very clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever\" \r\n  tending to reduce the crime from the greater offense to the lesser. It is impossible \r\n  on these facts to find that there was no evidence whatsoever tending to show \r\n  ABHAN. Because Heyward was entitled to the benefit of an ABHAN charge, the trial \r\n  judge's erroneous charge cannot be considered harmless. Accordingly, Heyward's \r\n  conviction for intent to commit first degree CSC is reversed and the case is \r\n  remanded for a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting): I respectfully \r\n  dissent. I would hold any error committed by the trial judge in instructing \r\n  the jury regarding assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature was harmless. \r\n  Here, given the evidence, the appellant was not entitled to the charge in the \r\n  first place.\r\n\r\nThe only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the \r\n  evidence is that the assault that the appellant committed on the victim, a person \r\n  whom he did not know, was solely for the purpose of subduing her and carrying \r\n  her away for the purpose of raping her. His statement to her that he was taking \r\n  her for a ride \"to get some of [her] good stuff,\" together with the victim's \r\n  understanding that he meant to rape her, are probative of this and this only. \r\n  Indeed, there is no evidence otherwise. \r\n\r\nAnd that is what distinguishes this case from State v. \r\n  Drafts, 288 S.C. 30, 340 S.E.2d 784 (1986), the case that the majority views \r\n  as controlling. There, the appellant testified in his own defense and claimed \r\n  \"he did not want to do anything\" to the victim. Here, the appellant did not \r\n  testify and thus offered no evidence about what he intended to do or not do \r\n  to the victim.\r\n\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We decide this case without oral argument \r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3504","title":"Wilson v.

Beatty, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Opinion No. 3504\r\n    Heard March 5, 2002 - Filed May 28, 2002  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John L. McDonald, Jr., of Clawson &amp; Staubes, of Charleston, \r\n          for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Francis X. McCann, of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Joseph Wilson brought this \r\n  action against Charles Rivers for injuries he allegedly sustained in a car accident. \r\n  The jury returned a verdict for Wilson. Rivers appeals, arguing the trial judge \r\n  erred in refusing to admit the deposition of his expert witness in biomechanics. \r\n  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWilson was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a co-worker, \r\n  Deborah Ryan, which was stopped at a red light when Rivers' car struck them \r\n  from behind. At the time of the impact, Wilson was wearing a seatbelt and was \r\n  leaning forward to retrieve his keys from the car's floorboard.\r\n\r\nWilson brought this personal injury action. In his amended \r\n  answer, Rivers admitted simple negligence \"in allowing the front of his vehicle \r\n  to bump the rear of the vehicle in which [Wilson] was a passenger\" but asserted \r\n  Wilson's claims of back pain and surgery were unrelated to the low-speed collision.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Wilson testified he did not call EMS or go to \r\n  the hospital immediately following the accident. The next Monday, he went to \r\n  a doctor, had x-rays made, and was diagnosed with \"some soft-tissue damage.\" \r\n  When Wilson failed to improve after several months, he was given an MRI and \r\n  referred to an orthopedist who diagnosed him with a ruptured disk. The orthopedist \r\n  recommended surgery after an epidural failed to provide Wilson relief. Wilson \r\n  underwent a spinal fusion in December 1997. At the time of trial, Wilson's medical \r\n  bills totaled $54,324.88, and he claimed lost wages of $8,872.47.\r\n\r\nWilson introduced the depositions of two of his treating \r\n  physicians. The first testified that Wilson had a disk rupture with an annular \r\n  tear and a herniated disk at L4-5 and \"to a reasonable degree of medical certainty \r\n  that the accident most probably did cause the injury that subsequently led to \r\n  [Wilson's] necessity for surgery.\" However, he did note that Wilson had degenerative \r\n  arthritis in his lower back that probably predated the accident. Wilson's orthopedic \r\n  surgeon testified to the same injuries and stated they were consistent with \r\n  being in a bent over position during an impact. Wilson testified he had no back \r\n  pain prior to the accident.\r\n\r\nIn support of his contention that the accident did not cause \r\n  Wilson's injuries, Rivers sought to introduce the depositions of a radiologist \r\n  and Dr. Richard Harding, a purported expert in the field of biomechanics. The \r\n  radiologist's testimony was admitted, and he testified that it is unusual for \r\n  trauma of an acute nature to involve just one disk if there has been no fracture. \r\n  He believed this accident did not cause or aggravate Wilson's injuries. The \r\n  thrust of Dr. Harding's testimony was that Wilson's injuries were not likely \r\n  caused by the accident in question. After reading the deposition and conducting \r\n  a lengthy colloquy on the matter, the trial judge refused to admit the deposition \r\n  because he was concerned it would confuse the jury. \r\n   (1)\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Wilson for $103,500. The \r\n  trial judge granted Rivers a setoff for the amount previously tendered to Wilson \r\n  by the primary insurance carrier but denied his post-trial motions for a new \r\n  trial absolute or new trial nisi remittitur. Rivers appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Rivers contends the trial judge abused his discretion \r\n  in excluding Dr. Harding's videotaped deposition regarding the injuries reportedly \r\n  sustained by Wilson. We disagree.\r\n\r\nRivers' argument focuses on Dr. Harding's qualification \r\n  as an expert in the field of biomechanics. However, based on our review of the \r\n  record, the trial judge did not specifically refuse to qualify Dr. Harding as \r\n  an expert, but instead excluded the deposition under Rule 403, SCRE. Although \r\n  he expressed concerns about Dr. Harding's qualifications, he ultimately found \r\n  that the deposition was more prejudicial than probative and that the testimony \r\n  would be confusing to the jury.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating proposed expert testimony, trial judges consider \r\n  Rules 702 and 403, SCRE. See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 20, \r\n  515 S.E.2d 508, 518 (1999). Rule 403 provides for the exclusion of otherwise \r\n  relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the \r\n  danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. \r\n  . . .\" This analysis is subject to an abuse of discretion standard. State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 358, 543 S.E.2d 586, 593 (Ct. App. 2001). An \r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's decision is unsupported by the \r\n  evidence or controlled by an error of law. Ledford v. Pennsylvania Life Ins. \r\n  Co., 267 S.C. 671, 675, 230 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976). Moreover, \"[a] trial \r\n  judge's decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect \r\n  of evidence should be reversed only in 'exceptional circumstances.'\" Hamilton, \r\n  344 S.C. at 357-58, 543 S.E.2d at 593 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found Harding seemed confused about the \r\n  subject of his testimony and gave contradictory answers about the basis of his \r\n  opinion. Based on our review of the deposition, we find there is evidence supporting \r\n  the trial judge's decision to exclude Dr. Harding's deposition. For example, \r\n  Harding testified that he made his determination about Wilson's injuries caused \r\n  by the accident based on his determination of the change in velocity at impact \r\n  which he reached by looking at the damage to the vehicles, but he then testified \r\n  that the amount of property damage does not determine the extent of injury. \r\n  Harding also testified that he did not know either the speed of Rivers' vehicle \r\n  or Wilson's precise position at impact. From this evidence, we find the trial \r\n  judge properly concluded that the jury would be unduly confused by the testimony. \r\n  Although this is a close case, it is not an exceptional circumstance warranting \r\n  reversal. Because we do not believe the trial judge exceeded his discretion \r\n  in excluding the evidence under Rule 403, SCRE, we affirm his decision.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., dissenting:  Because I believe \r\n  there is no evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding that \r\n  Harding's proposed testimony would be confusing to the jury and therefore more \r\n  prejudicial than probative, I respectfully dissent. \r\n\r\nRule 403, SCRE provides that evidence, even if relevant, \r\n  \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed \r\n  by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the \r\n  jury . . . .\" (emphasis added). Although the trial court's decision on the admission \r\n  of an expert's testimony is largely discretionary, \"the exercise of this discretion \r\n  will be reversed where an abuse of discretion has occurred.\" Payton v. Kearse, \r\n  329 S.C. 51, 61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211 (1998).\r\n\r\nThe trial court's only reasons for deciding Harding's testimony \r\n  would confuse the jury were that Harding \"doesn't understand [biomechanics] \r\n  himself\" and that he \"contradict [sic] himself on numerous cases [sic] as for \r\n  the basis for his opinion.\" To the contrary, in my view Harding's proffered \r\n  testimony clearly demonstrates his understanding of physics as it applies to \r\n  the human body, and furthermore that his alleged contradictions are not contradictory \r\n  at all. \r\n\r\nHarding's deposition testimony was based on his expertise \r\n  in medicine and biomechanics, \"a branch of physics that deals with the understanding \r\n  of what happens when people . . . are exposed to forces.\" In reaching his conclusions, \r\n  he considered Wilson's medical records, the depositions of Wilson's treating \r\n  physicians, the accident report, and photographs of and repair cost estimates \r\n  for both vehicles, along with his knowledge of impact tests by Consumer Reports \r\n  and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on the Mazda 626, the type of \r\n  car in which Wilson was riding. As a result, Harding opined that, to a reasonable \r\n  degree of medical certainty, the forces involved in the accident were not of \r\n  a sufficient magnitude or direction to cause the disk herniating suffered by \r\n  Wilson. \r\n\r\nHarding further testified his conclusion was based on a \r\n  measured calculation called the impact-related change in velocity, or \"delta \r\n  V,\" which he explained \"represents the difference between the velocity of [Wilson's \r\n  vehicle] before the accident to the velocity of [his] vehicle as a consequence \r\n  of the accident.\" He stated that \"the higher the delta V, the more likely it \r\n  is to cause injury, because the change in velocity occurs over a very short \r\n  period of time and, as such, imposes accelerations and therefore force on the \r\n  individuals in the vehicle.\" Based on his review of the documentary evidence, \r\n  Harding concluded the delta V on the Mazda \"was no greater than five miles an \r\n  hour.\" \r\n\r\nThe majority proposes to affirm the trial court based on \r\n  allegedly contradictory answers by Harding. As to the issue of the property \r\n  damage, Harding testified that one factor he reviewed in evaluating \r\n  the case was the damage to both vehicles; on cross-examination, he freely admitted \r\n  he would not testify \"that the amount of property damage to a car . . . determines \r\n  the extent of injury [to] an occupant.\" Regarding the speed of Rivers' vehicle, \r\n  Harding specifically stated it was not a relevant consideration in his analysis \r\n  because the delta V is the change in speed of Wilson's vehicle. \r\n  Finally, Harding's testimony evidenced an understanding of Wilson's position \r\n  when the accident occurred. As Harding reviewed an illustration drawn by one \r\n  of his medical artists showing an individual bent over by \"about 45 degrees,\" \r\n  the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Q. [A 45 degree angle] wouldn't be a realistic example in \r\n    this case because Mr. Wilson had his chest on his knees and his hands in the \r\n    floorboard at the time of the wreck. Are you aware of that?\r\n\r\n  A. Well, I know that's what he said on occasions. He's also \r\n    just said he was leaning forward and couldn't recall precisely how he was \r\n    postured at the time of the impact. But that he was leaning forward.\r\n\r\n  Q. So you don't know what his position was at the time of \r\n    impact yourself?\r\n\r\n  A. Not precisely. That is correct. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there is nothing contradictory or remotely \r\n  confusing about this testimony. In a recent case on similar facts, the Louisiana \r\n  Court of Appeal held a trial judge improperly excluded testimony from a biomechanics \r\n  expert. See Russell v. Roadrunner Towing &amp; Recovery, 765 So. \r\n  2d 373 (La. Ct. App. 2000). There, as here, the expert was asked to determine \r\n  whether a low-speed collision could have caused the plaintiff's herniated disk \r\n  based on a review of vehicle photographs, repair estimates, driver statements, \r\n  and the plaintiff's medical records. Id. at 377. The court stated that \r\n  &quot;[a]ny alleged failure to visit the scene or supply specific facts in the \r\n  analysis or conclusion provides a basis for attack [on] cross-examination.\" \r\n  Id. More specifically, the court found the expert's references to \"force \r\n  vector and injury mechanisms at various speeds\" supported his proffered opinion \r\n  and would not prejudice or confuse the fact finder. Id.; see also \r\n  Berkeley Elec. Co-op, Inc. v. S. C. Pub. Serv. Common, 304 S.C. 15, 20, \r\n  402 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1991) (\"Where the expert's testimony is based upon facts \r\n  sufficient to form the basis for an opinion, the trier of fact determines its \r\n  probative value.\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would find the exclusion of Harding's testimony \r\n  prejudiced Rivers, who offered it to support his defense that the low-speed, \r\n  low-impact accident could not have caused Wilson's back injury, the major issue \r\n  in dispute at trial. As noted by the Russell court, the relative importance \r\n  of such expert testimony increases in low-speed collisions which involve serious \r\n  injuries:\r\n\r\n\r\n  As the force of impact in a collision lowers, and the seriousness \r\n    of the injury rises, expert testimony becomes more relevant. An expert's commentary \r\n    on speed, rate of acceleration, force of impact, and the correlation to injuries \r\n    suffered as exemplified in reliable published studies would become an integral \r\n    part of the defense or plaintiff's case. A plaintiff or defendant cannot be \r\n    deprived of their right to offer a reasonable presentation of issues . . . \r\n    .\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 376. \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would hold the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in excluding Harding's testimony, and would therefore \r\n  reverse and remand for a new trial. See Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. \r\n  161, 171, 558 S.E.2d 921, 926 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding the exclusion of expert \r\n  testimony \"not harmless error as there was no equivalent testimony presented\").\r\n\r\n1. In excluding the deposition, the trial \r\n  judge said, \"I don't think- I don't believe it will assist this Jury to understand \r\n  the evidence in this case. I believe it would be more confusing than anything \r\n  else and I would exclude it on that basis.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
