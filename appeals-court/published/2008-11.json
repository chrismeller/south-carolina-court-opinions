McCants, III and Amy Patterson Shumpert, both of Aiken\r\n  and Stanford Ernest Lacy, of Columbia, for Appellants-Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\tAnn McCrowey Mickle, of Rock Hill and Thomas Roy Young, Jr., of\r\n  Aiken, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Â This\r\n  is a cross-appeal in a workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  The single commissioner\r\n  found the claimant, Respondent-Appellant Ernest Lee Paschal, sustained injuries\r\n  in an accident that arose out of and in the scope of his employment with\r\n  Appellant-Respondent Richard A. Price, d/b/a RAP Financial Services (Price) and\r\n  awarded him compensation at the maximum rate for the year during which the\r\n  accident occurred, plus lifetime medical benefits for permanent and total\r\n  disability.Â  These rulings were affirmed by the appellate panel of the South\r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission and the circuit court.Â \r\n  Appellants-Respondents Price and the S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund[1] appeal (1) the determination that\r\n  Paschal was Priceâ€™s employee rather than an independent contractor, (2) certain\r\n  aspects of the benefits awarded, and (3) the denial of a new hearing before a\r\n  different commissioner because of concerns that remarks by Paschalâ€™s attorney\r\n  may have tainted the proceedings.Â  In his appeal, Paschal alleges Priceâ€™s\r\n  appeal to the circuit court was untimely and, therefore, the court erred by\r\n  allowing it to proceed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND\r\n  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  1987, Price began collection work from his residence.Â  This work led to the\r\n  formation of RAP Financial Services (RAP), a sole proprietorship specializing\r\n  in the recovery of collateral, typically automobiles, for banks and other lienholders.Â  In addition to repossessors (known as â€œdriversâ€), RAP used\r\n  clerks, skip tracers, and other office personnel to work with lenders to\r\n  recover their collateral.Â  Initially, each worker was paid a salary without\r\n  deductions and received a 1099 form at the end of the year.\r\nIn 1996\r\n  or 1997, Price organized his drivers into teams.Â  Under the team concept, Price\r\n  paid all the expenses of a recovery as well as designated rates to each team\r\n  member.\r\nPaschal\r\n  first applied to work as a driver with RAP in April 1998, filling out a\r\n  preprinted form entitled â€œApplication for Employment.â€Â  The information Paschal\r\n  provided on the form indicated that he was submitting an application on his own\r\n  behalf and not as a principal of a business, desired work as a â€œrepo man,â€ and\r\n  had previously held two similar positions for which he was compensated â€œper\r\n  car.â€Â  RAP accepted Paschalâ€™s application and assigned him to a team; however,\r\n  Paschal worked as a driver for only a few weeks in 1998. \r\nIn the latter part of 1998, Price was audited by the Internal\r\n  Revenue Service.Â  As a result of the audit, RAP was reorganized so that its\r\n  account representatives, skip tracers, secretaries, and other clerical\r\n  personnel who worked within its office were compensated as employees and had\r\n  taxes withheld from their paychecks.Â  The team concept, however, was abandoned,\r\n  and drivers continued to be compensated as independent contractors.Â  \r\nIn January 1999, after Price discontinued the team concept,\r\n  Paschal again began working as a driver for RAP.Â  According to Price and other\r\n  witnesses, Paschal also signed an independent contractor agreement; however,\r\n  Paschal disputed this assertion and neither an original nor a copy of that\r\n  agreement could be produced.Â  Although Price maintained Paschal signed another\r\n  independent contractor agreement on January 4, 2000, only a copy of the\r\n  agreement could be produced at the hearing and Paschalâ€™s position was that the\r\n  duplicate was a forgery.\r\nAs they did with other drivers, RAP representatives would fax,\r\n  call, or personally deliver to Paschal information identifying and locating the\r\n  vehicles to be repossessed.Â  In addition, RAP instructed Paschal as to the most\r\n  expedient order in which to take possession of the vehicles that he was\r\n  responsible for recovering.\r\nUsually, RAP would assign accounts to drivers based on the\r\n  geographic location of the collateral to be repossessed.Â  Paschal, however,\r\n  would also handle accounts outside South Carolina and was often referred to as\r\n  the â€œclean-up manâ€ because he would repossess cars that other drivers could not\r\n  find in their respective locations.Â  \r\nAlthough Paschal initially used his own truck for his work, RAP\r\n  loaned him money for the purchase of additional trucks for his use in the\r\n  repossession business.Â  RAP also provided Paschal with a beeper, a toll-free\r\n  telephone number, a business card, and keys to facilitate access to many of the\r\n  cars being repossessed.Â  Price also allowed Paschal to use vehicles belonging\r\n  to RAP when Paschalâ€™s truck was not operable.Â  Although Paschal paid for fuel\r\n  and maintenance, RAP wrote off the depreciation on the vehicles as a business\r\n  expense.Â  RAP also loaned Paschal interest-free money for the purchase of other\r\n  equipment such as hydraulic lifts and tow packages, paying the providers\r\n  directly and subtracting the reimbursement payments from whatever was due\r\n  Paschal in a given week for the vehicles he had recovered.Â  When Paschal was\r\n  working away from his home, RAP provided financial assistance for gas money and\r\n  lodging.Â  In one instance, Price paid for a bus ticket for Paschal to go to Florida to pick up a car from another repossession facility.\r\nDuring 2000, the last year he worked as a driver for RAP, Paschal\r\n  was assigned more than six hundred accounts and worked seven days per week,\r\n  averaging two repossessions per day.Â  On an average day, RAP would page Paschal\r\n  eight to ten times to provide instructions and obtain updates from Paschal on\r\n  recovery efforts, even on vehicles he had already repossessed.Â  At times,\r\n  Paschal would return home at eight oâ€™clock in the morning after working all\r\n  night, only to be called an hour later by RAP and told to get up, come to the\r\n  office, get more accounts, and go to work.Â  Price would also call Paschalâ€™s\r\n  motherâ€™s home in Charleston at inappropriate hours looking for Paschal. Â On one\r\n  occasion, after Paschal returned home because he ran out of money, Price became\r\n  angry and instructed Paschal that in the future he was to call RAP to have\r\n  funds sent through Western Union.\r\nThe business card provided to Paschal was designed and paid for by\r\n  RAP.Â  It identified Paschal as a â€œfield adjusterâ€ and listed â€œRAP Financial\r\n  Servicesâ€ at the top in bold print.Â  Moreover, RAP directed its staff not to\r\n  mention to debtors that their vehicles were repossessed by independent\r\n  contractors.Â  RAP required Paschal to give this card to the debtor when\r\n  repossessing a vehicle or to leave the card at the debtorâ€™s residence.\r\nRAP ultimately remained responsible to the lienholders for the\r\n  recovery of the collateral and made arrangements for its drivers to store\r\n  vehicles at designated facilities.Â  It also provided Paschal with instructions\r\n  on how to mark the vehicles for identification and required him to complete a\r\n  â€œcondition report,â€ which RAP provided, describing wear and tear on the\r\n  collateral as well as an inventory of the personal items in the car for RAP to\r\n  give to the debtor.\r\nOn October 25, 2000, Paschal was severely injured when the\r\n  repossessed vehicle that he was towing blew a right rear tire and began to\r\n  swerve.Â  Paschal lost control of his own vehicle, which turned sideways,\r\n  swerved left into the median, and overturned.Â  Paschal was not wearing a\r\n  seatbelt and was thrown from his vehicle, which landed on him and crushed his\r\n  spinal cord, paralyzing him from the waist down.\r\nOn November 15, 2000, less than a month after Paschalâ€™s accident,\r\n  Price applied for a workersâ€™ compensation policy with Joe B. Babb &amp; Co.,\r\n  Inc.Â  In his application, Price indicated he did not use subcontractors.\r\nAfter the accident, Paschal met with a vocational rehabilitation\r\n  counselor who, with Paschalâ€™s input, set up a plan for his rehabilitation.Â \r\n  Paschal, however, did not follow through with the plan.Â  In July 2001, Paschal\r\n  worked as a skip tracer for RAP, but that employment lasted only a few weeks.Â \r\n  On April 4, 2002, during a deposition in a lawsuit unrelated to the present\r\n  litigation, Paschal acknowledged he did not bring a workersâ€™ compensation claim\r\n  for his injury and stated he was self-employed at the time of the accident. \r\nOn June 5, 2002, Paschal commenced this action by filing a Form 50\r\n  with the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Price filed a Form\r\n  51 admitting Paschal was injured in an automobile accident, but denying he was\r\n  an employee.Â  \r\nThe matter came before the single commissioner in December 2003\r\n  for three days and in January 2004 for one day.Â  On February 17, 2005, the\r\n  single commissioner issued an order in which he found Paschal was an employee\r\n  of RAP, had become totally disabled from the accident, and was entitled to the\r\n  maximum rate of compensation.Â  Price appealed to the appellate panel of the\r\n  South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission. \r\nOn\r\n  February 1, 2006, the appellate panel issued an order affirming the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s findings.Â  On Thursday, March 2, 2006, Price mailed his notice\r\n  of appeal to Paschal and the Clerk of Court for Aiken County (Clerk). Â Although the notice, along with the filing\r\n  fee, was timely received on March 3, the Clerk did not clock it in because a\r\n  civil cover sheet was not attached as required by an administrative order\r\n  issued by the South Carolina Supreme Court. Â On or about March 8, the Clerk returned the notice of appeal to Price\r\n  by mail with a form letter indicating a cover sheet was needed. Â Price\r\n  again submitted the notice of appeal with the cover sheet the same day.Â  The Clerk clocked in the notice of appeal\r\n  on March 10, 2006, and assigned a case number to the matter.Â  Price did not send Paschal another copy of the notice\r\n  of appeal with the accompanying cover sheet.\r\nOn\r\n  May 10, 2006, Paschal moved to dismiss Priceâ€™s appeal as untimely.Â  The following day, Price moved for a nunc\r\n    pro tunc order designating the filing of the notice of appeal as March 2,\r\n  2006.Â  The motion to dismiss came before the circuit court on May 31, 2006.Â  At\r\n  the hearing, counsel presented arguments on both Paschalâ€™s motion to dismiss\r\n  and Priceâ€™s appeal of the appellate panelâ€™s order.\r\nOn October 17, 2006, the circuit court issued an order affirming\r\n  the decision of the appellate panel.Â  Price filed a notice of appeal with this\r\n  Court on November 15, 2006.Â  Thereafter, on November 27, 2006, the circuit\r\n  court issued an order denying Paschalâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  The court later\r\n  denied a motion[2] by Paschal to alter or amend the denial of his motion to dismiss, and Paschal\r\n  filed his notice of cross-appeal with this Court on February 23, 2007.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Appeal of\r\n  Price and S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund\r\nA.Â  Paschalâ€™s\r\n  Status as an Employee\r\nRAP\r\n  first takes issue with the finding that Paschal was its employee rather than an\r\n  independent contractor, arguing the facts of this case favor a contrary\r\n  determination.Â  We, however, hold RAP has not carried its burden to show the\r\n  finding that Paschal was an employee was against the weight of the evidence.\r\nIn workersâ€™ compensation law, the existence of an\r\n  employer-employee relationship is a jurisdictional question.Â  Nelson v.\r\n    Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110. 112 (2002).Â Â  If the\r\n  factual issue before the commission involves a jurisdictional question, review\r\n  by the appellate court is governed by the preponderance of the evidence\r\n  standard.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the appellate court has the power to decide\r\n  the issue of jurisdiction based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 314 S.C. 43, 45, 443 S.E.2d\r\n  803, 804 (1994).Â  Nevertheless, â€œ[w]hile the appellate court may take its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of evidence on the existence of an employer-employee\r\n  relationship, the final determination of witness credibility is usually reserved to the Appellate\r\n  Panel.â€Â  Hernandez-Zuniga v. Tickle, 374 S.C. 235, 243-44, 647 S.E.2d\r\n  691, 695 (Ct. App. 2007). Â Furthermore, the appellant has the burden to show\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s finding regarding jurisdiction is against the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 182, 528\r\n  S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether a claimant qualifies as an employee for workersâ€™\r\n  compensation purposes is â€œa fact-specific determination reached by applying\r\n  certain general principles.â€Â  S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n v. Ray Covington\r\n    Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995).Â  Among these\r\n  principles is â€œSouth Carolinaâ€™s policy to resolve jurisdictional doubts in\r\n  favor of the inclusion of employers and employees under the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act.â€ Â Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d\r\n  700, 703 (2000) (citing Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 21, 467\r\n  S.E.2d 117, 119 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nIn determining whether a claimant qualifies as an employee for the\r\n  purpose of eligibility for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, â€œ[t]he general test\r\n  applied is that of control by the employer.â€Â  Young v. Warr, 252 S.C.\r\n  179, 189, 165 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1969).Â  â€œIt is not the actual control then exercised, but whether there\r\n  exists the right and authority to control and direct the particular work or\r\n  undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.â€Â  Id. (cited in Nelson, 349 S.C. at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 113). In\r\n  determining whether an alleged employerâ€™s right of control is such that a\r\n  claimant is an employee rather than an independent contractor, courts have\r\n  looked to four factors:Â  â€œ(1) direct evidence of right to or exercise of\r\n  control, (2) method of payment, (3) furnishing of equipment and (4) right to\r\n  fire.â€Â  Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196,\r\n  200, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970).Â  As to the relative weight to be accorded\r\n  these factors, the supreme court, quoting a leading treatise has stated as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\t[F]or the most part, any single factor is not merely indicative\r\n  of, but, in practice, virtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in\r\n  the opposite direction, contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best only\r\n  mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no\r\n  such force at all.\r\n\r\nDawkins, 341 S.C. at 439, 534 S.E.2d at 703\r\n  (quoting 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n    Law, Â§ 61.04 (2000)).\r\n1.Â  Right of\r\n  Control\r\nRegarding\r\n  the right of control, we agree with Price that the actual exercise of control\r\n  by a principal does not create an employment relationship.Â  Still, direct\r\n  evidence of the exercise of control is recognized as one of the factors to\r\n  which courts have looked to determine whether a claimant is an employee or an\r\n  independent contractor.Â  Tharpe, 254 S.C. at 200, 174 S.E.2d at 399; see\r\n    also 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n      Law, Â§ 61.05[3] (noting that there is often â€œno written or tangible\r\n  document indicating the degree of control reservedâ€ and that â€œ[e]vidence of\r\n  actual control exercised by the employer and submitted to by the employee\r\n  becomes, in such cases, the best indication of what the parties understand the\r\n  employerâ€™s right of control to beâ€).\r\nIn affirming the finding of the appellate panel and single\r\n  commissioner that Paschal was an employee of RAP, the circuit court noted the\r\n  following as evidence of RAPâ€™s right to control the manner in which Paschal\r\n  performed his duties:Â  (1) RAP provided comprehensive information to Paschal\r\n  regarding the location of the vehicles he was to repossess; (2) RAP determined\r\n  the most expedient order in which to repossess cars; (3) RAP provided Paschal\r\n  and other drivers with beepers and toll-free numbers in order to maintain\r\n  contact with them; (4) RAP provided keys to its drivers so that they could gain\r\n  entry to the vehicles they were attempting to repossess; (5) RAP required\r\n  Paschal to complete certain forms with updated recovery information that RAP\r\n  would provide to its clients; (6) Price paged Paschal as often as ten times per\r\n  day, often at odd hours, to provide instructions and obtain current information\r\n  on recovery efforts and would become upset when Paschal did not answer a page;\r\n  (7) RAP sent money to Paschal while he was working away from his home â€œin order\r\n  to keep him workingâ€; (8) RAP paid for and designed a business card for Paschal\r\n  to leave with debtors that identified Paschal as a â€œfield adjusterâ€ with the\r\n  title â€œRAP Financial Servicesâ€ listed at the top along with RAPâ€™s telephone\r\n  numbers; (9) RAP gave its drivers specific instructions for completing\r\n  appraisals and inventory reports, taking the recovered property to designated\r\n  locations, and marking repossessed vehicles for identification; (10) Price made\r\n  all the decisions and financial arrangements for the repossessed collateral;\r\n  and (11) RAP, not its drivers, remained responsible for returning repossessed\r\n  vehicles to the respective lienholders.\r\nAlthough Price has taken issue with the implication of these\r\n  findings, he has not challenged the findings themselves.Â  Admittedly, some of\r\n  these findings are more appropriately viewed as control necessary to obtain an\r\n  appropriate end result.Â  Nonetheless, several of the findings support the\r\n  conclusion reached by the prior tribunals hearing this matter that the control\r\n  exerted by Price and RAP over Paschal exceeded what was necessary to ensure the\r\n  recovery of delinquent collateral.[3]Â \r\n  Moreover, we cannot ignore Paschalâ€™s informal designation as the â€œclean-upâ€ man,\r\n  which made his position different from that of other drivers in that he had to\r\n  be available for assignments away from home at RAPâ€™s behest; thus, the frequent\r\n  calls from Price and the provision of money to Paschal while he was working\r\n  away from his home were more for the purpose of ensuring his availability for\r\n  such assignments rather than enabling him to complete the assignments\r\n  themselves.\r\n2.Â  Furnishing\r\n  of Equipment\r\nPrice\r\n  asserts error in the circuit courtâ€™s finding that â€œRAP provided the vast\r\n  majority of the equipment used by Paschal in the repossession of collateral,â€\r\n  contending that he provided assistance in this regard either because of his\r\n  generous nature or with the understanding that Paschal would reimburse him.Â  We\r\n  do not dispute that a number of the items that the circuit court listed as\r\n  having been provided by RAP to Paschal for his work were either gifts from\r\n  Price or obtained by Paschal with interest-free loans from Price; however, we also\r\n  note RAP provided a number of other items of equipment to Paschal at its own\r\n  expense that did not result from Priceâ€™s largesse.Â  These included a beeper, a toll-free telephone number,\r\n  and transportation expenses.Â  Moreover, consistent with the recognized\r\n  principle that doubts regarding workersâ€™ compensation coverage are to be\r\n  resolved in favor of inclusion, we hold Paschalâ€™s provision of his own\r\n  equipment does not override the control exerted by RAP over the details of his\r\n  work.Â  See Larson, Â§ 61.07[1] (noting the claimantâ€™s\r\n  furnishing of equipment may, if accompanied by other factors, indicate\r\n  independent contractor status, â€œbut in itself it is not necessarily fatal to a\r\n  showing of employment based on other groundsâ€).\r\n3.Â  Method of\r\n  Payment\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that RAPâ€™s provision of a 1099\r\n  form rather than a W-2 form is not necessarily determinative of whether Paschal\r\n  was an employee or an independent contractor at the time of his accident.Â  See Nelson, 349 S.C. at 599, 564 S.E.2d at 115 (noting that the method of\r\n  payment weighed in favor of the alleged employer but declining to view this\r\n  factor as dispositive of whether the claimant was an employee).Â  In keeping\r\n  with our standard of review, we also decline to disturb the commissionâ€™s finding\r\n  that RAP set non-negotiable fees that drivers would receive for repossessions.Â \r\n  Furthermore, consistent with Nelson, we note that, although the method\r\n  of payment in this case may suggest Paschal was an independent contractor\r\n  rather than an employee of RAP, the testimony of Paschal and others that Price\r\n  determined the fee drivers would receive for a repossession suggests some\r\n  degree of control on Priceâ€™s part.Â  See id. (â€œAlthough [the\r\n  method of payment] weighs in favor [of] Yellow Cab, it had some degree of\r\n  control over payment inasmuch as it dictated the amounts Nelson could charge\r\n  fares . . . .â€) (emphasis in original).\r\n4.Â  Right to\r\n  Fire\r\nAs required by our standard of review, we accept as valid the\r\n  concerns expressed by the single commissioner and affirmed by the appellate\r\n  panel and the circuit court about the authenticity of a written document that\r\n  Price claimed Paschal had signed and purportedly contained the terms of an\r\n  independent contractor agreement between Paschal and RAP.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Paschalâ€™s testimony that, on one occasion when he was reluctant to repossess a\r\n  vehicle, Price â€œ[t]old me that I worked for him and that if I did it again I\r\n  would be terminatedâ€ is evidence that Price himself viewed the partiesâ€™\r\n  relationship as one between employer and employee.Â  Finally, although Price\r\n  argued on appeal that â€œit is apparent the relationship between Claimant and\r\n  Price could not be ended until Claimant delivered all vehicles he repossessed\r\n  and Price paid Claimant for those services,â€ he cited no evidentiary support\r\n  for this assertion other than the independent contractor agreement that was\r\n  discredited by the workersâ€™ compensation commission.[4]\r\nB.Â  Paschalâ€™s\r\n  entitlement to lifetime benefits\r\nRAP challenges the finding that Paschal was entitled to lifetime\r\n  benefits, arguing Paschal failed to carry his burden to show his paraplegia\r\n  resulted in permanent and total disability.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  section 42-9-10(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007), an employee who\r\n  suffers total disability from a job-related injury is entitled to certain\r\n  specified benefits for a period not exceeding five hundred weeks.Â  The limitation\r\n  of the period to five hundred weeks is waived, however, for â€œany person\r\n  determined to be totally and permanently disabled who as a result of a\r\n  compensable injury is a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered\r\n  physical brain damage.â€Â  Id. Â§ 42-9-10(C).Â  By statute, such a claimant\r\n  â€œshall receive benefits for life.â€Â  Id.Â  As the supreme court has noted,\r\n  the legislature has categorized these injuries as â€œper se disablingâ€\r\n  such that â€œthe claimant need not show a loss of earning capacity.â€Â  Wigfall\r\n    v. Tideland Utils., 354 S.C. 100, 105, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 (2003).Â  Here,\r\n  it was undisputed that Paschal became a paraplegic as a result of a\r\n  work-related injury; therefore, he did not have to show a loss of earning\r\n  capacity because he was â€œpresumptively totally disabled.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\nC.Â \r\n  Credibility Findings of Paschal and Price\r\nRAP\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in upholding the single commissionerâ€™s finding\r\n  that Paschal was a more credible witness than was Price.Â  It was largely in\r\n  reliance on this finding that the single commissioner determined the allegation\r\n  that Paschal had signed an independent contractor agreement, a copy of which\r\n  was admitted into evidence, was false.Â  We find no error.\r\nIn support of this argument, RAP contends the single commissioner,\r\n  in assessing credibility, failed to give adequate consideration to documents in\r\n  evidence, eyewitness testimony refuting several of Paschalâ€™s statements, and an\r\n  admission by Paschal in a deposition that he considered himself to be self-employed\r\n  when he was working as a driver for RAP.Â  In our view, however, these are not\r\n  sufficient reasons for this Court to deviate from the general rule that â€œ[w]hile\r\n  the appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of evidence on\r\n  the existence of an employer-employee relationship, the final determination of\r\n  witness credibility is usually reserved to\r\n  the Appellate Panel.â€Â  Hernandez-Zuniga, 374 S.C. at 243-44, 647 S.E.2d at\r\n  695. Â The reliability of the documents and witness statements themselves were\r\n  matters of credibility for the appellate panel, which, in upholding the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s order, discounted the credibility of a number of witnesses\r\n  testifying on behalf of RAP for various reasons, including their demeanor on\r\n  the stand, biases, obvious fallacies in their statements,[5] and their failure to provide adequate\r\n  documentation for their statements.Â  \r\nAs to Paschalâ€™s statement during a deposition in a separate\r\n  lawsuit that he had not yet filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim for his\r\n  injuries because he was â€œself-employed,â€ the single commissioner found that, at\r\n  the time of the deposition, Paschal did not understand the difference between\r\n  an employee and an independent contractor and referred to himself as both during\r\n  that deposition.Â  The single commissioner also noted that, in any event, what\r\n  the parties called their relationship would not be dispositive of what that\r\n  relationship was.Â  RAP has not given us any basis to rejct the reasons cited by\r\n  the single commissioner, who was affirmed by both the appellate panel and the\r\n  circuit court, for discounting Paschalâ€™s purported admission that he was an\r\n  independent contractor rather than an employee.\r\nD. Request for\r\n  Criminal Prosecution\r\nRAP\r\n  further maintains the circuit court erred in upholding the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s decision not to grant a new hearing before a different\r\n  commissioner after counsel for Paschal allegedly tainted the proceedings by\r\n  requesting the single commissioner to refer Price to the South Carolina Attorney\r\n  General for criminal prosecution.Â  RAP argues the request gave Paschal a\r\n  collateral advantage and was a deliberate, calculated, and planned effort to\r\n  intimidate Priceâ€™s testimony and to deter him from asserting a vigorous\r\n  defense.[6]Â \r\n  We find no reversible error.\r\nBoth\r\n  the single commissioner and the circuit court noted the untimeliness of RAPâ€™s\r\n  motion for a new hearing as a reason for denying it,[7] and RAP has not challenged this\r\n  ground in its appellantâ€™s brief.Â  Absent such a challenge, there is no reason\r\n  for us to consider whether RAP was entitled to a new hearing based on its\r\n  allegations that it was intimidated by the threats of criminal prosecution.Â  See Anderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477\r\n  (1996) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision because the appellant appealed\r\n  only one of the two independent grounds supporting it). \r\n\r\n\r\nE.Â  Admissibility of Life Care\r\n  Plan\r\nRAP next takes\r\n  issue with the admission into evidence of a life care plan prepared by Paschalâ€™s expert, arguing the plan was speculative and irrelevant in a workersâ€™\r\n  compensation case because benefits are set by statute.Â  Because, however, we\r\n  have already determined that Paschal is entitled to lifetime medical benefits\r\n  as a matter of law, we hold any error in the admission or consideration of the\r\n  life care plan is harmless.\r\nF.Â  Admission of IRS Agentâ€™s\r\n  Testimony\r\nRAP also alleges\r\n  error in admitting testimony from a retired IRS agent regarding the factors\r\n  used by the IRS to determine whether someone is an employee or an independent\r\n  contractor, complaining the admission of such testimony allowed the record to\r\n  be tainted with IRS standards.Â  From our reading of the orders of the three\r\n  tribunals that have reviewed this matter, however, it is our view that the\r\n  determination that Paschal was an employee of RAP was based on South Carolina workersâ€™ compensation law and was in no way influenced by the IRS criteria.Â \r\n  Assuming without deciding that the admission of the disputed testimony was\r\n  error, we hold it did not prejudice RAP.\r\nG.Â  Reliance on Sellers\r\n  v. Pinedale Residential Center\r\nRAP also attempts\r\n  to distinguish Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Center, 350 S.C. 183, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 694 (Ct. App. 2002), and contends the circuit court erred in relying on\r\n  this case in determining whether the compensation rate set for Paschal was not\r\n  excessive.Â  We reject this argument.\r\nThe employee in Sellers was a teenager who had worked three part-time summer jobs and was rendered a paraplegic\r\n  in a single-car accident.Â  Noting the claimant had aspired to become a master\r\n  electrician like his father and uncles, had a demonstrated work ethic, and had\r\n  already made significant progress toward his career goal, this Court applied\r\n  the â€œexceptional reasonsâ€ rule to provide for progressively higher wages based\r\n  on probable future earnings.[8]Â \r\n  RAP argues that, in contrast to the employee in Sellers, Paschal was an\r\n  adult who had already selected his trade and was a less deserving claimant in\r\n  terms of his character.\r\nAlthough the single\r\n  commissioner and the circuit court cited Sellers in their orders, the\r\n  compensation rate for which Paschal was deemed eligible was based on 2000 data\r\n  of his earnings and expenses rather than on his anticipated future earning\r\n  capacity.Â  As such, we hold that, even if reference to Sellers in any of\r\n  the prior orders in this case was incorrect, the error was harmless.\r\nH.Â  Reliance on Form 20\r\nFinally, RAP\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in upholding the single commissionerâ€™s\r\n  reliance on an erroneous Form 20 that was formally withdrawn four months before\r\n  the hearing.Â  According to RAP, the Form 20 was erroneously based on Paschalâ€™s\r\n  gross earnings rather than his net earnings, that is, his gross earnings less\r\n  his expenses.Â  We reject this argument.\r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner found Paschalâ€™s compensation rate was $507.34, the same amount\r\n  indicated on the disputed Form 20.Â  In making this finding, the single\r\n  commissioner found that â€œthis result, regardless of the method that is used,\r\n  most accurately reflects Paschalâ€™s earnings and is fair to both Price and\r\n  Paschal.â€ Â The circuit court, in affirming this finding, further noted\r\n  â€œPachalâ€™s average weekly wage and compensation rate was [sic] supported by many\r\n  other documents in the record,â€ and Paschal, in his respondentâ€™s brief, went to\r\n  great lengths to provide supporting figures for this finding.[9]Â \r\n  Considering that Price has not, in either his appellantâ€™s brief or his reply\r\n  brief, challenged the evidence cited to support the weekly compensation awarded\r\n  to Paschal, we fail to see how the Form 20, even if inaccurate, was prejudicial\r\n  to RAP.\r\nII.Â  Cross-Appeal\r\nAs\r\n  we have noted earlier, although Priceâ€™s notice of appeal was timely received by\r\n  the circuit court, the clerk of court returned it without clocking it in\r\n  because it lacked an accompanying civil cover sheet.Â  When counsel returned the\r\n  notice with the cover sheet, it was clocked in after the filing deadline.Â  Paschal\r\n  filed a cross-appeal with this Court, arguing the circuit court should have\r\n  dismissed Priceâ€™s appeal as untimely.Â  Specifically, Paschal\r\n  argues the circuit court erred by finding the civil cover sheet was not required\r\n  to file an appeal from the workersâ€™ compensation commission.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn\r\n  March 19, 2004, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an order (Order) approving\r\n  the use of Civil Cover Sheet, SCCA/234 (3/2004), (Cover Sheet) in the circuit\r\n  courts of the state.Â  The Order stated in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tFor the\r\n  purposes of administration, the attached form will be mandatory effective July\r\n  1, 2004, and required with all initial pleadings filed in the court of Common\r\n  Pleas.Â  Prior to the effective date of July 1, 2004, the civil coversheet is\r\n  optional and not required in counties where Alternative Dispute Resolution is\r\n  not mandated.Â  This coversheet should be completed, in its entirety, by the\r\n  attorney filing the action and served on the defendant with the Summons and\r\n  Complaint.Â  This coversheet shall remain as an attachment in order to document\r\n  the nature of the action that is being filed and as proof of payment of the\r\n  filing fee. \r\n\r\nThe Cover Sheet itself notes,\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  cover sheet and information contained herein neither replaces nor supplements\r\n  the filing and service of pleadings or other papers as required by law.Â  This\r\n  form is required for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of\r\n  docketing.Â  It must be filled out completely, signed, and dated.Â  A copy of\r\n  this cover sheet must be served on the defendant(s) along with the Summons and\r\n  Complaint. \r\n\r\nAside from providing spaces\r\n  for the caption, case number, and contact information for counsel, the Cover\r\n  Sheet provides checkboxes to indicate â€œNature of Actionâ€ and â€œDocketing\r\n  Information,â€ such as whether a jury trial is demanded.Â  In the â€œNature of\r\n  Actionâ€ section, under the â€œAppealsâ€ subheading, is a â€œWorkerâ€™s Compâ€ checkbox. \r\nSection\r\n  1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (2005) sets forth the filing requirements\r\n  for appeals of administrative decisions under the South Carolina Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act prior to July 1, 2006.[10]Â \r\n  Nowhere in that section or in section 42-17-60, which addresses procedures for\r\n  appealing a workersâ€™ compensation award, is there any mention that a cover\r\n  sheet is necessary when filing an appeal.Â  In keeping\r\n  with the supreme courtâ€™s recent decision in Skinner v. Westinghouse Electric\r\n    Corp., we decline to hold that a cover sheet, which is not required by\r\n  statute, is essential to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See Skinner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., Op. No. 26560\r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 3, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 41 at 22, 24) (â€œOur\r\n  jurisprudence confirms that jurisdictional appealability issues are governed by\r\n  statute, and not by the rules of civil procedure.â€). Â \r\nIn their briefs, the parties request this Court to find different\r\n  purposes for the Cover Sheet. Â In\r\n  deciding this question, we find the rules of statutory interpretation\r\n  instructive.Â  When interpreting a statute, all of the language must be read in\r\n  a sense that harmonizes with its subject matter.Â  Thompson ex rel. Harvey v. Cisson Constr. Co., 377 S.C. 137, 157, 659 S.E.2d 171, 181 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Here,\r\n  the Order clearly states the Cover Sheet is required â€œfor the purposes of\r\n  administration.â€Â  The Order refers to â€œinitial pleadingsâ€ and states the Cover\r\n  Sheet should be served with the Summons and Complaint, the initial pleadings in\r\n  an action.Â  The notion that the Cover Sheet is for administrative purposes only\r\n  is further supported by language in the Order that the Cover Sheet is to be\r\n  used â€œto document the nature of the actionâ€ and â€œas proof of payment of the\r\n  filing fee.â€Â  The Cover Sheet itself declares that it does not â€œsupplement[ ]\r\n  the filing and service of pleadings or other papers.â€Â  In light of this\r\n  language, it is our view that the Cover Sheet is at most a ministerial\r\n  requirement.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, the notice of appeal received by the Clerk on March 3, 2006,\r\n  satisfied the applicable requirements of the South Carolina Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act, the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, and the South\r\n  Carolina Appellate Court Rules.Â  Both this Court and the supreme court have\r\n  held clerical errors in the notice of appeal do not destroy an appeal. Â See State v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 587, 571 S.E.2d 700, 701 (2002)\r\n  (acknowledging that service of the notice of appeal is a jurisdictional\r\n  requirement, but stating â€œnon-prejudicial clerical errors in the notice are not\r\n  detrimental to the appealâ€); Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 577-78,\r\n  532 S.E.2d 310, 313 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding the incorrect reference in the\r\n  notice of appeal to the motion for reconsideration rather than the final order\r\n  did not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to hear the appeal and noting the\r\n  appellant did attach a copy of the appealed order to the notice); Charleston\r\n    Lumber Co. v. Miller Hous. Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 478, 458 S.E.2d 431, 435\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œClerical errors in a notice of appeal do not destroy the\r\n  appeal.â€).Â  We see no reason not to apply these holdings to the present dispute.\r\nPaschal\r\n  further argues the circuit court erred by failing to find it was deprived of\r\n  appellate jurisdiction after the Clerk of Court delayed filing Priceâ€™s notice\r\n  of appeal until after the thirty-day time limit[11] because it did not include a Cover Sheet.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe\r\n  are mindful of the fact that â€œ[t]he acts of a\r\n  court with respect to a matter as to which it has no jurisdiction are void.â€ Â State\r\n    v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 107, 572 S.E.2d 309, 312 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Here,\r\n  we are not faced with an issue of subject matter jurisdiction but one of\r\n  appellate jurisdiction.Â  Quite simply, the procedural or administrative rule as\r\n  to the cover sheet does not act to deprive the court of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  See Skinner, Op. No. 25650 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 3, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 41 at 22, 24)(â€œFailure of a party to comply\r\n  with the procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal may deprive the court\r\n  of appellate jurisdiction over the case, but does not affect the courtâ€™s\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.â€) (citations omitted).\r\nPaschal\r\n  was timely and properly served when Price sent the notice of appeal on March 2,\r\n  2006; therefore, Paschal had notice of Priceâ€™s appeal. Â Paschal does not allege\r\n  any prejudice from the omission of a Cover Sheet from the notice, nor does he\r\n  assert that he was unaware of Priceâ€™s appeal because of it.Â  We therefore\r\n  reject Paschalâ€™s effort â€œto take advantage of mere clerical error by which [he]\r\n  was in no way prejudiced or misled.â€ Â Charleston Lumber, 318 S.C. at\r\n  478, 458 S.E.2d at 436; see also Parissi v. Telechron, Inc., 349\r\n  U.S. 46, 47 (1955) (holding the inadvertent failure of the appellant to include\r\n  the required filing fee did not vitiate the validity of the otherwise timely\r\n  filed notice of appeal); Scott, 351 S.C. at 587-88, 571 S.E.2d at 702\r\n  (wherein the supreme court held it was â€œnot deprived of subject matter\r\n  jurisdictionâ€ because of the citation of the incorrect county from which the\r\n  appeal was taken); Weatherford, 340 S.C. at 578, 532 S.E.2d at 313\r\n  (holding that â€œ[t]hough [the appellant] did not â€˜technicallyâ€™ appeal from the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s original order by referring to it in the Notice of Appeal,â€ this\r\n  failure did not warrant dismissal of the appeal because the omission was â€œof a\r\n  clerical nature onlyâ€); Miles v. Miles, 303 S.C. 33, 36, 397 S.E.2d 790,\r\n  792 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œThis Court has long recognized an overriding rule which\r\n  says â€˜whatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t matter.â€™â€) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the Clerk declined to clock and file the notice of appeal for\r\n  reasons that did not affect the substance of the appeal or the notice given to\r\n  Paschal.Â  We recognize that courts of this State have refused to elevate form\r\n  over substance and accordingly affirm the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Paschalâ€™s\r\n  motion to dismiss. Â See Matter of Ferguson, 313 S.C. 120, 124,\r\n  437 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1993) (holding in a judicial misconduct matter that the mere\r\n  fact that the respondent was no longer a judge at the time of the proceedings\r\n  were initiated against him was irrelevant); Gordon v. Busbee, 367 S.C.\r\n  116, 119-21, 623 S.E.2d 857, 859-60 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding the statutory\r\n  requirement that a written statement must be â€œin the form prescribed by ruleâ€\r\n  â€œrefers to the manner or â€˜procedure as determined or governed by regulation,â€™\r\n  not to a specific â€˜document with blanks for the insertion of . . . informationâ€™â€)\r\n  (citation omitted).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs to Paschalâ€™s\r\n  cross-appeal, we uphold the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to dismiss Priceâ€™s appeal\r\n  as untimely.Â  As to the merits of Priceâ€™s appeal, we affirm the denial of\r\n  Priceâ€™s request for a new hearing before a different hearing commissioner as\r\n  well as the findings that Paschal was an employee of RAP at the time of his\r\n  injury and was entitled to lifetime benefits at the maximum rate of\r\n  compensation.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund is a party to this\r\n  action because Price did not have workersâ€™ compensation at the time of\r\n  Paschalâ€™s accident.Â  The name â€œPriceâ€ will be used interchangeably to refer to\r\n  Richard Price, RAP Financial Services, the S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund, or any\r\n  combination thereof.\r\n[2] The motion to reconsider and to alter and/or amend\r\n  judgment does not address the circuit courtâ€™s ability to issue a nunc pro\r\n    tunc order in this situation.Â  Indeed, this Court is unable to find any\r\n  signed nunc pro tunc order from the circuit court in the Record on\r\n  Appeal.\r\n[3]Â  We note the â€œIndependent Contractor Agreementâ€ that\r\n  Paschal denied signing requires only that the contractor â€œutilize its best\r\n  effortsâ€ in recovering property and does not have any terms mandating quotas or\r\n  deadlines for taking possession of delinquent collateral or requiring the\r\n  driver be available at the behest of RAP for assignments; therefore, the\r\n  agreement, even if valid, does not necessarily lend itself to supporting a\r\n  finding that RAPâ€™s efforts in furtherance of productivity goals were measures\r\n  to achieve a desired end result.\r\n[4]Â  Moreover,\r\n  although the purported agreement required â€œindependent contractorsâ€ such as\r\n  Paschal to supply proof of both garage liability insurance and their own\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance, Paschal never obtained either form of\r\n  insurance and RAP never asked for proof of coverage.Â  We therefore agree with\r\n  Paschal that the agreement, even if authentic, did not reflect the true\r\n  relationship between the parties.\r\n[5]Â  For example, as the single commissioner noted, one\r\n  witness for RAP â€œadamantly refused to admit that repossession of a car was an\r\n  important part of RAPâ€™s business.â€\r\n[6]Â  In\r\n  her opening statement, counsel for Pascal advised the request for the referral\r\n  for criminal prosecution resulted from concerns that Price had altered\r\n  documents in the case.\r\n[7] When Paschalâ€™s attorney made the request for criminal\r\n  prosecution, counsel for RAP expressed his opposition, characterizing the\r\n  request as a threat to scare Price into settling the case; however, he did not\r\n  move at that time to have the matter heard by another commissioner.\r\n[8]Â  The exceptional reasons rule in Sellers is\r\n  based on section 42-1-40, which provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n\tWhen for exceptional reasons the foregoing\r\n  [definition of â€œaverage weekly wagesâ€] would be unfair, either to the employer\r\n  or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be\r\n  resorted to as will most nearly approximate the\r\n  amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-40 (1985 and Supp. 2007).\r\n[9] In fact, Paschal submitted that, using his figures,\r\n  his weekly compensation rate would be $515.70, which exceeds the rate he was\r\n  awarded.\r\n[10] This statute was amended in 2006 to provide for\r\n  review to an administrative law judge and appeal to this Court.Â  2006 S.C.

The owner had\r\n  relocated out of state and hired Allen, an agent with Prudentialâ€™s Summerville\r\n  office, to sell the home.Â  \r\nGauld\r\n  offered to buy the residence â€œas isâ€ for $400,000, but made the deal contingent\r\n  upon her satisfaction with a home inspection and an appraisal at or above the\r\n  purchase price.Â  After the home inspection and an appraisal valuing the home at\r\n  $420,000, Gauld accepted the property â€œas isâ€ and closed in May 2004.Â  She and\r\n  her husband moved in and made substantial repairs.Â  Gauld testified that,\r\n  within a week of closing, she was approached by a landscaper asking to cut her\r\n  lawn.Â  Through their conversation, she became aware of the proposed extension\r\n  of Phase III of the Berlin G. Myers Parkway along the Sawmill Branch, three\r\n  hundred feet behind the home.Â  According to Allenâ€™s deposition, Phase III has\r\n  been discussed over the last thirty-five years with citizens and environmental\r\n  attorneys resisting its construction.Â  Phases I and II were completed years ago.Â \r\n  Approximately six months after the closing on 102 Lucretia Lane, a Dorchester County tax referendum passed providing potential funds for road projects.Â  In\r\n  Allenâ€™s estimation, this event made the construction of the road a â€œprobability.â€Â  \r\nMultiple appraisals were conducted on 102 Lucretia Lane valuing it\r\n  at $570,000 in April 2005, $605,000 in May 2005, and $650,000 in January 2006. Â On\r\n  January 4, 2005, Gauld put the property up for sale with an asking price of\r\n  $650,000, which she later increased to $660,000.Â  In June 2005, the house was\r\n  advertised at $660,000, and a listing in the record, dated July 7, 2006,\r\n  features a price of $787,500.Â  When asked why she listed the home at more than\r\n  its appraisal, Gauld explained:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAgain, Iâ€™m not a realtor, but usually when youâ€™re \r\n\t\t\tselling real estate, you donâ€™t put the price you want.&nbsp; You add \r\n\t\t\ta little on top.&nbsp; No one is ever going to offer you what youâ€™re \r\n\t\t\tasking, that Iâ€™m aware of.&nbsp; Secondly, there was some personal \r\n\t\t\tproperty conveyed, and that value was not reflected in here.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI, also, in following the local comps, was aware that land right in \r\n\t\t\tTea Farm was selling for - - like, a cluster lot was selling for \r\n\t\t\t200,000, and my opinion, my lot, a portion of the price was low in \r\n\t\t\there.&nbsp; Iâ€™m not an expert, but to me it seemed a little low on \r\n\t\t\tthe golf course.&nbsp; I have great views.&nbsp; Thatâ€™s just my \r\n\t\t\tpersonal opinion.&nbsp; That means nothing.&nbsp; Iâ€™m not an \r\n\t\t\tappraiser.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAlthough Gauldâ€™s deposition is difficult to follow, it indicates she\r\n  received offers of $650,000, $629,500, and $665,000.Â  Additionally, she averred\r\n  to having been offered $630,000 in a cash deal.Â  In her deposition, Gauld was asked\r\n  about the homeâ€™s worth:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\t[Y]ouâ€™ve listed it more than what\r\n  it appraised for throughout the whole thing.Â  You keep listing it at higher\r\n  [than] the appraisal when you know that an appraisal is going to require it be\r\n  reduced?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tMaybe, maybe not.&nbsp; I donâ€™t know that.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tHave you examinedâ€”this property now as I understand \r\n\t\t\tit, in your estimation, what should it sell for?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWell, thereâ€™s two answers to that question.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThereâ€™s what it should be worth without the parkway.&nbsp; And if I \r\n\t\t\twere to buy into the theory that not only does the parkway not \r\n\t\t\tnegatively impact this property and yet itâ€™s actually a positive \r\n\t\t\tselling point, and if you look at the comps currently in Tea Farm, \r\n\t\t\tthereâ€™s a property listed on East Johnson Street at $305 a square \r\n\t\t\tfoot.&nbsp; Thereâ€™s a property that just sold right behind mine at \r\n\t\t\t160 a square foot.&nbsp; And say I hypothetically accept that my \r\n\t\t\tproperty is not superior to that on East Johnson at 305 a square, \r\n\t\t\tyet I believe itâ€™s definitely superior to the property that just \r\n\t\t\tsold on East Shephard at 160 a square foot,\r\n  if you cut that down the middle, my property without the parkway will be would\r\n  over a million dollars, if you do the math.Â  Now, because of the parkway, I\r\n  would never get anywhere near that amount of money.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJeffery Wyman, Gauldâ€™s expert witness, opined the house was worth\r\n  a maximum of $650,000. Â Wyman was asked about the increase in property\r\n  values in the neighborhood:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; Do you have an idea of the average \r\n\t\t\tannual appreciation for Tea Farm and the Miler Country Club area for \r\n\t\t\tthe last five years?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI didnâ€™t do an appreciation study, per se.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tBut if we look at sales and resales of housesâ€”for example, the Gauld\r\n  house, which is the subject of this, she purchased at 400,000 approximately two\r\n  years ago and at least got an offer of 650 to 665.Â  So youâ€™re talking about 50\r\n  percent over two yearsâ€”45 percent.Â  So itâ€™s probably in the neighborhood of any\r\n  where from 15 to 20 percent average.Â  But, again, the latest statistics I saw\r\n  show the prices going down, people reducing prices to move property.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhen shown the listing for Gauldâ€™s first attempt to sell the house,\r\n  Wyman stated:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tThis is 1-4-05.&nbsp; Okay, this is a listing, \r\n\t\t\tsheâ€™s asking $660,000, which is about six months, more or less, \r\n\t\t\tafter she purchased it. . . .&nbsp; She listed it in January for \r\n\t\t\tapparently $660,000.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd as far as youâ€™reâ€”within six months of a sale \r\n\t\t\tand appraisal, a sale at 400,000 and an appraisal at 420, in your \r\n\t\t\topinion, is that a realistic listing price?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWell, if we made the assumption that the 420 was \r\n\t\t\tthe market value, my assumption, this would be rather substantialâ€”to \r\n\t\t\tme, it would be overpriced at that point.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAnd thatâ€™s just based upon assuming that it was \r\n\t\t\t420?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tRight.&nbsp; Again, I didnâ€™t do an appraisal.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI didnâ€™t go back and look at the market at that time.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAre you aware of any improvements or changes that \r\n\t\t\tshe made in the property?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tSheâ€”when I interviewed her, she said that she made, \r\n\t\t\tI believe $50,000 worth of repairs, to include the pool andâ€”I donâ€™t \r\n\t\t\tremember all of them, but she madeâ€”she alluded to me that she made \r\n\t\t\tapproximately $50,000 worth of repairs.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tEven with the 50,000, and if there are repairs on \r\n\t\t\tthere, is that still high?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tAgain, Iâ€™m not trying to evade your \r\n\t\t\tquestion, but I donâ€™t know what all the repairs were.&nbsp; I donâ€™t \r\n\t\t\tknow what the state of the house was when she bought it.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tObviously she felt it was worth 400,000, and some appraiser felt \r\n\t\t\tlike it was worth 420.&nbsp; Now, you can do a lot of cosmetic work \r\n\t\t\tfor $50,000.&nbsp; And cosmetic work, a lot of times people buy the \r\n\t\t\tsizzle.&nbsp; They buy theâ€”but I donâ€™t know that it would get to \r\n\t\t\tthis level.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tThis 660, you donâ€™t think thatâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tRight, it would be a stretch.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWyman was not asked to appraise other property along the proposed\r\n  parkway nor conduct appraisals considering noise impact or the value of the 102 Lucretia Lane with or without the parkway in place: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\t[M]y question was, you were not\r\n  asked to give a valuation [of what the property was worth with the road or\r\n  without the road]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tNo, I didnâ€™t quantify any amount.&nbsp; Iâ€™m not \r\n\t\t\tsure you could.&nbsp; By making that answer, Iâ€™m not saying that \r\n\t\t\tthere isnâ€™t a law of diminution in value.&nbsp; Iâ€™m just not sure \r\n\t\t\thow you quantify it.&nbsp; We like to have comparative sales, but \r\n\t\t\tusually on high-end properties like that, youâ€™ve got noise \r\n\t\t\tattenuation devices such as sound walls and things like that.&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAllen answered questions concerning his method of valuing homes.Â  At\r\n  his deposition, Allen was asked whether he currently had any homes listed at a\r\n  price he considered to be in excess of ten percent of their actual worth.Â  In\r\n  this context, a discussion arose concerning 106 E. Johnston, the Tea Farm home with\r\n  the higher square footage price Gauld cited in deriving her valuation of her\r\n  home.Â  The property had a current list price of $1.1 million, but in Allenâ€™s\r\n  opinion is was likely worth $950,000.Â  \r\nHe explained 106 E. Johnston was built in the 1950s, featured a\r\n  pool, pool house, an additional 1000 feet of unfinished space, a two-acre lot,\r\n  exceptional landscaping with two-hundred year old live oaks, and was completely\r\n  remodeled in 1994 by three professional interior designers. Â Allen called 106\r\n  E. Johnston â€œa very unique property,â€ â€œan extraordinary property,â€ and\r\n  â€œprobably one of the three top houses in the whole Summerville area.â€Â  He based\r\n  his estimated value of $950,000 in part on historic properties in Summerville\r\n  because he believed the home was â€œmore in that category than a typical\r\n  subdivision house, which most of the houses in the Tea Farm are . . . .â€ \r\nLater in the deposition, Allen was asked his opinion of a fair\r\n  listing price for 102 Lucretia Lane.Â  He replied:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI would say thatâ€”itâ€™s hard to tell without looking \r\n\t\t\tat it, and I havenâ€™t seenâ€”I understand that sheâ€™s done some \r\n\t\t\timprovements to it.&nbsp; But not having seen what the improvements \r\n\t\t\tare, I can give you a range, but you know, I wouldâ€”I would say a \r\n\t\t\trange might be between five and a quarter and six, somewhere in that \r\n\t\t\trange.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; If youâ€™ll give me second, Iâ€™ll pull out \r\n\t\t\tmy calculator.&nbsp; I just want to get a general idea.&nbsp; That \r\n\t\t\tapparently will take forever.&nbsp; Hang one second here.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\tMy clientâ€™s house is roughly 4600 square feet; does that sound\r\n  about right?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tOr 45.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tYeah, 45.&nbsp; On the high end of 600,000, and I \r\n\t\t\tknow that Iâ€™m notâ€”I mean, obviously youâ€™re just giving me some ball \r\n\t\t\tpark numbersâ€”thatâ€™s about $133.00 a square footâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tUh-huh.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tâ€”for that property.&nbsp; Are the sales inside Tea \r\n\t\t\tFarm subdivision, is that what the comparable properties are doing, \r\n\t\t\t133 a square foot?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI havenâ€™t seen a look at an analysis recently so I \r\n\t\t\tdonâ€™t know what they are.&nbsp; Itâ€™sâ€”\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDoes that sound low, or does that sound high?&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIt sounds about right.&nbsp; Sounds about right to \r\n\t\t\tme.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tThe property that we discussed earlier on Johnston \r\n\t\t\tStreet, what did you say that square footage was?&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tFinished and heated square footage, itâ€™s 4000 \r\n\t\t\tbecause if you count the poolhouse, which is heated, cooled, and \r\n\t\t\titâ€™s got a bathroom, so a full bath.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; And if we use the ten percent less \r\n\t\t\tnumber of 950,000, thatâ€™s $237.00 a square foot.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYeah.&nbsp; Iâ€™m telling you that is out of the box.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThat is an out of the box listing, and you just cannot compare an \r\n\t\t\tout-of-the-box listing with something that is more in the box, and \r\n\t\t\t102 Lucretiaâ€™s\r\n  in the box.Â  If youâ€™d take a look at the house, 300 Elizabeth, 6000 square\r\n  feet, just sold for $650,000.00, which is less that 110 a square foot.Â  So, I\r\n  mean, someâ€”some things are just out of the box andâ€”if you look at East Johnston and put that up there, youâ€™re talking an apple and an orange or maybe an\r\n  apple and a grapefruit.Â  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDo homes on Lucretia Lane, to your\r\n  knowledge, again, do they sell for more than 133 a square foot?Â  I mean, have\r\n  there been some comparable sales back there?Â  I know you havenâ€™t recently, but\r\n  you know the market pretty good.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYeah.&nbsp; As far as whether they have sold for \r\n\t\t\tover 133 a square foot?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIâ€™m not real sure.&nbsp; I donâ€™t thinkâ€”I donâ€™t \r\n\t\t\treally think they have been sold for over 133 a square foot on Lucretia.Â  I could check my records for you.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDespite Allenâ€™s insistence that 106 E. Johnston was in a different\r\n  class than the 4500 square foot 102 Lucretia Lane, Gauld entered into the\r\n  record a document titled â€œFair Market Analysis of 102 Lucretia Laneâ€ that\r\n  relied in part on the list price of the $1.1 million home.Â  Specifically, in her calculation, Gauld\r\n  first used the $158.63 per square foot selling price of a nearby home and\r\n  multiplied this number by 4500 to get $713,835.Â  She then multiplied the $305\r\n  per square foot list price of 106 E. Johnson by 4500 to get $1,372,500.Â  By\r\n  adding $713,835 to $1,372,500, she produced a sum of $2,086,335 which she\r\n  divided by 4500.Â  This division produced the number 231.81 which she multiplied\r\n  by 4500 to derive $1,043,145.Â  Gauldâ€™s analysis thus concludes with â€œa Fair\r\n  Market Value of $1,043,145 for 102 Lucretia Lane according to Chip Allen.â€Â \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Gauld contends she has suffered diminution in value of $393,145, the difference\r\n  between her expertâ€™s $650,000 appraisal and her â€œFair Market Appraisalâ€ of\r\n  $1,043,145.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review\r\n  all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence\r\n  in a light most favorable to appellant, the non-moving party below.â€Â  Bergstrom\r\n    v.

Greenwood Development Corp., 328 S.C. 585,\r\n  493 S.E.2d 875 (Ct.

Â Unlike Gauld, Hawkins â€œbased his opinion on the\r\n  damages sustained to his property on his knowledge of similar nearby\r\n  parcels.â€Â  Id. at 599, 493 S.E.2d at 882 (emphasis added).Â  See also Hill v. City of Hanahan, 281 S.C. 527, 316 S.E.2d 681 (Ct. App. 1984) (in\r\n  inverse condemnation case, a property ownerâ€™s testimony that she was\r\n  knowledgeable about real property values in her neighborhood and believed her\r\n  property to be worth $75,000 was admissible evidence).\r\nGiven Gauldâ€™s involvement with 102 Lucretia Lane and her\r\n  experience in real estate, she is familiar with her property and competent to\r\n  testify to its value.Â  Nevertheless, she has offered a computation of\r\n  diminution in value that is completely devoid of any rational basis.Â  Although\r\n  she argues she has â€œnot pulled a random number out of the sky,â€ she inexplicably\r\n  anchored her proposed damages in part on the list price of dissimilar property raised\r\n  by Allen in a context unrelated to either 102 Lucretia Lane or the parkway.Â  \r\nGauld admitted both property values she relied upon to calculate\r\n  diminution in value are based on homes which are not comparable to her own.Â  Her\r\n  reasoning that, because she considers 102 Lucretia Lane to be superior to one\r\n  property and inferior to another, one can calculate her homeâ€™s value without\r\n  the parkway simply by manipulating the numbers and â€œsplit[ing] it down the\r\n  middleâ€ is absurdly speculative if not disingenuous.Â  Despite her expertâ€™s\r\n  admonition that he did not appraise the home considering the impact of the\r\n  Phase III extension, Gauld insinuates his appraisal of $650,000 represented the\r\n  homeâ€™s value as affected by the prospective road.Â  With her misplaced reliance\r\n  on the sale and list prices of non-comparable properties, Gauldâ€™s attempt to\r\n  avoid the appearance of making a â€œbald allegationâ€ fails.\r\nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Gauld, all\r\n  appraisals and offers received on 102 Lucretia Lane indicate the property\r\n  appreciated after its purchase and refurbishing.Â  There being nothing to take\r\n  Gauldâ€™s diminution of value calculation out of the realm of pure conjecture, we\r\n  hold the circuit court properly concluded there was no competent, admissible\r\n  evidence of the existence or amount of damages, an element common to all her\r\n  claims.Â  Accordingly, we need not address Gauldâ€™s remaining issues on appeal.Â  See Wilson v.

Johnson, III, of Columbia, for\r\n  Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Donna Brailsford (Donna), in her\r\n  individual and representative capacities, appeals the trial courtâ€™s Order\r\n  Granting Summary Judgment and Dismissing Causes of Action, arguing (1) her\r\n  cause of action on behalf of the estate of William M. Brailsford (William) for\r\n  fraud survived Williamâ€™s death; and (2) in the alternative, the trial judge\r\n  lacked authority to issue the Order after engaging in allegedly inappropriate\r\n  ex parte communication with opposing counsel.Â  Donna also appeals the denial of\r\n  her motion to alter or amend, alleging the trial judge was without jurisdiction\r\n  to issue the order after having orally recused himself.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis appeal is from the Orangeburg County Court of Common Pleas and\r\n  involves the trusts and estates of Marjorie Brailsford (Mother) and John F.\r\n  Brailsford (Father).Â  During their lives, Mother and Father created a trust,\r\n  from which upon their deaths the proceeds were to be distributed to each of\r\n  their five children: Â John Jr., William, Marjorie Nickel, Elizabeth Davis, and\r\n  Florence Brailsford[1].Â \r\n  The amount to be distributed to each child was to be adjusted to allow for any\r\n  gifts given to the respective child during the lives of Mother and Father.Â  Both\r\n  Mother and Father died in 2000.Â  William died in 2001, survived by his widow,\r\n  Donna, and an incompetent daughter, Kelly Brailsford.Â  Â Â \r\nJohn Jr., served as the personal representative of the estates of both\r\n  Mother and Father.Â  He also served as a co-trustee of the trust, along with Marjorie\r\n  and Elizabeth, as well as co-guardian of the incompetent Florence.\r\nThis action was commenced by Donna, personally and in her capacity\r\n  as Personal Representative of Williamâ€™s estate alleging ten causes of action,\r\n  including an action entitled â€œfraud.â€Â  Subsequently, Kelly was joined as a plaintiff;\r\n  however, she does not join in this appeal. Initially Donna and Kelly were\r\n  represented jointly by attorneys Adele Pope and Pope Johnson.Â  However, on December\r\n  29, 2004, the trial court issued an order relieving each from joint\r\n  representation and ordering Johnson to represent only Kelly and Pope to\r\n  represent only Donna. Â \r\nIn her complaint, Donna alleges various instances of fraudulent\r\n  conduct that, among other things, affected the amount of distributions made by\r\n  the trust to Williamâ€™s estate.[2]Â \r\n  Among these causes of action was one for fraud arising from a transaction in\r\n  1989, in which John, Jr., acquired Williamâ€™s 49% interest in the family owned\r\n  business by allegedly concealing from him a tort claim the company had.Â  By\r\n  becoming 100% owner, John Jr. became the sole recipient of an $8 Million\r\n  settlement. \r\nDefendant moved the court for summary judgment, and on December 1,\r\n  2004, a hearing was held on this motion, at which Attorney Johnson appeared on\r\n  behalf of all plaintiffs.Â  During the hearing the trial judge orally granted summary\r\n  judgment and dismissed Donnaâ€™s â€œfraudâ€ cause of action and other causes of\r\n  action that alleged fraud or deceit against William, â€œwhether called fraud or\r\n  something else.â€Â  On February 22, 2005, the trial judge issued a written\r\n  Order Granting Summary Judgment and Dismissing Causes of Action, as to\r\n  fraudulent facts and circumstances relating to William Brailsford before his\r\n  death, stating as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the Plaintiffâ€™s third cause of action premised on Fraud is\r\n  dismissed with prejudice as to all Plaintiffs to the extent this cause of\r\n  action is based on facts relating to William Brailsford prior to his death. (2)\r\n  As to all other causes of action, any portion thereof that is premised upon or\r\n  supported by allegations or evidence generally constituting fraud and deceit,\r\n  and relating to William Brailsford, are dismissed with prejudice.Â  (3) This\r\n  Order does not constitute a bar to any evidence or cause of action pertaining\r\n  to facts and circumstances not meeting the general definition of fraud and\r\n  deceit and unrelated to William Brailsford.\r\n\t[3]\r\n\r\nIn the interim, between the oral granting of summary judgment and\r\n  entry of the written order, counsel for Donna alleged the trial judge engaged\r\n  in inappropriate ex parte communication with opposing counsel. Based on this\r\n  belief, on February 24, 2005, Donnaâ€™s attorney filed a Motion to Recuse,\r\n  alleging the judge to be, inter alia, biased and incapable of rendering an\r\n  impartial opinion. \r\nSubsequently on March 1, 2005, Donna filed a Motion to Alter or\r\n  Amend the Judgment of the court as to the granting of summary judgment.Â  On\r\n  March 7, 2005, a hearing was held on Donnaâ€™s Motion to Recuse.Â  Â During the\r\n  hearing the trial judge denied the accusations set forth in the motion but\r\n  nonetheless stated he was recusing himself from the case. \r\nOn March 9, the trial judge issued a written denial of Donnaâ€™s\r\n  Motion to Alter or Amend and the next day, March 10, issued a written Order of\r\n  Recusal, recusing himself from the case. \r\nDonna now appeals the granting of summary judgment and also\r\n  alleges that it was improper for the trial judge to rule on her Motion to Alter\r\n  or Amend.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same\r\n  standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: Â summary judgment\r\n  is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose,\r\n  350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).&nbsp; In determining whether a\r\n  triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn\r\n  from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d\r\n  161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Survivability of a fraud\r\n  cause of action\r\nDonna\r\n  first argues that section 62-1-106 of the South Carolina Probate Code operates\r\n  as a survival statute, which would allow a fraud claim to survive the death of\r\n  William Brailsford.Â  This argument was not preserved for appeal.Â  \r\nGenerally\r\n  â€œ[a] party cannot use a motionâ€¦to alter or amend a judgment to present an issue\r\n  that could have been raised prior to judgment but was not.â€ Tallent v. South\r\n    Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 363 S.C. 160, 165, 609 S.E.2d 544, 546 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005); see also MailSource, LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs. Inc.,\r\n  356 S.C. 370, 374, 588 S.E.2d 639, 641 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œA party cannot raise\r\n  an issue for the first time in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion which could have been\r\n  raised at trial.â€).Â  In the case sub judice, the argument concerning section\r\n  62-1-106 was never presented to the trial court before the filing of the Motion\r\n  to Alter or Amend; therefore, it is not preserved for appeal and we decline to\r\n  address it. \r\nDonna\r\n  next argues that it was error for the trial court to dismiss her â€œfraudâ€ cause\r\n  of action and other causes of action that were based on acts against William\r\n  before his death.Â  We disagree, but herein modify the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nStatutory\r\n  law in South Carolina provides â€œ[c]auses of action for and in respect toâ€¦any\r\n  and all injuries to the person or to personal property shall survive both to\r\n  and against the personal or real representativeâ€¦of a deceased personâ€¦any law or\r\n  rule to the contrary not withstanding.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (1976).Â  South Carolina, however, has long recognized several exceptions to the survivability of a\r\n  claim, including an exception for fraud.Â  See Mattison v. Palmetto\r\n    State Life Ins. Co., 197 S.C. 256, 15 S.E.2d 117 (1941) (actions for fraud\r\n  or deceit are excepted from the survivability statute); Ferguson v.\r\n    Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564-65, 564 S.E.2d 94, 97\r\n  (2002); Pamplico Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Prosser, 295 S.C. 621, 625, 193\r\n  S.E.2d 539, 540 (1972); Brewer v. Graydon, 233 S.C. 124, 124, 103 S.E.2d\r\n  767, 769 (1958).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, Donna pleads a cause of action for fraud as well as various\r\n  other causes of action.Â  Applying this Stateâ€™s longstanding exception to the\r\n  survivability statute for fraud, as set forth in Mattison and reiterated\r\n  in Ferguson, her third cause of action for fraud cannot survive\r\n  Williamâ€™s death.Â  We therefore hold that the trial judge properly dismissed her\r\n  cause of action for fraud.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  it relates to the other causes of action, the trial judge found â€œall other causes of action [and] any portion thereof that\r\n  is premised upon or supported by allegations or evidence generally constituting\r\n  fraud and deceit, and relating to William Brailsford, are dismissed with\r\n  prejudice.â€Â  The trial court order made no specific ruling on which, if\r\n  any, causes of actions were dismissed.[4]Â  \r\nThe fraud\r\n  exception to survivability is not limited only to a cause of action titled\r\n  â€œfraud.â€ Ferguson, 394 S.C. at 564-65, 564 S.E.2d at 97.Â  In Ferguson , our supreme court recognized that although Fergusonâ€™s cause of action arose\r\n  under the â€œDealer Act,â€[5] the essence of the Defendantâ€™s alleged conduct amounted to misleading Mr.\r\n  Ferguson, and concealing overcharges by either intentional deception or gross\r\n  negligence. Id. The court held that because such actions fit within the ambit\r\n  of fraudulent or deceptive conduct, it was insignificant what â€œlabelâ€ the\r\n  Plaintiff gave to such conduct. Id. at 565, 564 S.E.2d at 97. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  insomuch as any of Donnaâ€™s causes of action are essentially a cause of action\r\n  for fraud simply disguised under a different title, such actions do not survive\r\n  Williamâ€™s death.Â  We, however, do not read Ferguson to go so far as to\r\n  deny the admission of evidence of fraudulent conduct to support an otherwise\r\n  surviving claim.Â  Although Respondents concede that the Order speaks only to\r\n  Donnaâ€™sÂ  third cause of action for fraud, to the extent the Order may be\r\n  interpreted to suggest that causes of action which do survive William cannot be\r\n  supported by evidence of the defendantâ€™s fraudulent and deceitful\r\n  conduct, the Order is hereby modified.Â Â  \r\nII.Â  The effect of the ex\r\n  parte communication\r\nDonna\r\n  next argues that the trial judge should not have ruled on either the summary\r\n  judgment motion or her motion to alter or amend after engaging in the allegedly\r\n  inappropriate ex parte communication.Â  We do not agree.[6]\r\nThe\r\n  substance of this argument is that the ex parte communication created bias or\r\n  prejudice on the part of the trial judge.Â  In South Carolina, however, â€œ[i]t is\r\n  not enough for a party to allege bias; a party seeking disqualification of a\r\n  judge must show some evidence of bias or prejudice.â€ Doe v. Howe, 367\r\n  S.C. 432, 441, 626 S.E.2d 25, 28 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Christensen v.\r\n    Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 74, 476 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1996) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted)); see also Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 524, 599 S.E.2d\r\n  114, 118 (2004) (â€œUnder South Carolina law, if there is no evidence of judicial\r\n  prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure to disqualify himself will not be reversed on\r\n  appeal.â€).\r\nHere\r\n  Donna cannot demonstrate that the grant of summary judgment was affected by, or\r\n  the product of, bias or prejudice. Although the ex parte communication occurred\r\n  before the issuance of the final written order, any bias allegedly created by\r\n  such communication had no effect on the order.Â  This is evidenced by the fact\r\n  that the written order was substantially the same as the oral order announced\r\n  from the bench prior to the ex parte communication.Â Â  Furthermore, because the\r\n  denial of the motion to alter or amend was merely an affirmation of the proper\r\n  denial of summary judgment, we also dismiss this argument as it relates to the\r\n  denial of the Rule 59(e) motion.\r\nIII.Â  The effect of the\r\n  oral grant of recusal\r\nFinally,\r\n  Donna argues it was error for the trial judge to rule on the motion to alter or\r\n  amend after orally recusing himself from the case, i.e., the trial judgeâ€™s pronouncements from the bench should have\r\n  immediate, final, and binding effect.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder Rule 58 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure,\r\n  â€œ[e]very judgment shall be set forth in a separate document[,] [and such]\r\n  judgment is effective only when so set forth and entered into the\r\n  record.â€Â  Rule 58 SCRCP. (emphasis added).Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  has held that under Rule 58 â€œthe written order is the trial judgeâ€™s final\r\n  orderâ€ and until entry of the written order the judge is free to change his\r\n  mind. Ford v. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821,\r\n  823 (2001); First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. Hitman, Inc., 306 S.C. 327, 411\r\n  S.E.2d 681 (Ct. App. 1991), affâ€™d, 308 S.C. 421, 418 S.E.2d 545 (1992).Â \r\n  An oral order of the court is not final and binding until reduced to writing,\r\n  signed by the judge, and delivered for recordation. Case v. Case, 243\r\n  S.C. 447, 134 S.E.2d 394 (1964).\r\nMore specifically, this Court has held that an oral order of\r\n  recusal is not binding on the court; rather, the order is not effective until\r\n  and unless so entered in writing. See Simpson v. Simpson, 377\r\n  S.C. 519, 524, 660 S.E.2d 274, 278 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding that when the trial\r\n  judge orally granted a motion to recuse but later issued a written denial on\r\n  the same motion, the oral order had no binding effect on the court).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  in light of Rule 58, and Simpson, the trial judgeâ€™s oral recusal in this\r\n  case was not final and effective until reduced to writing and entered of record\r\n  with the clerk.Â  Hence, because the denial of the motion to amend was entered\r\n  prior to the written order of recusal, it was proper.[7]Â  \r\nAppellant urges this Court to adopt a rule requiring that when a\r\n  trial judge is presented with a motion to recuse, he must first rule on that\r\n  motion before addressing any other business between the litigants.[8]Â  Because, however, the granting of\r\n  summary judgment was proper and because the trial judge recused himself to\r\n  avoid further animosity in the litigation rather than from any bona fide\r\n  concerns about his impartiality, the denial of the motion to alter or amend did\r\n  not inure to Donnaâ€™s prejudice.Â  Thus, while we think the better practice\r\n  suggests disposition of any motion to recuse prior to the resolution of other\r\n  pending matters, we do not find this case an appropriate one to consider the\r\n  adoption of such a rule.[9]\r\nAccordingly, the trial judge did not err in granting summary\r\n  judgment, nor was it error to deny the motion to alter or amend.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Florence is incompetent suffering from cerebral\r\n  palsy and blindness. \r\n[2] These causes of action included (1) Breach of\r\n  Fiduciary Duty, (2) Removal of Personal Representative and Trustee, (3) Fraud,\r\n  (4) Distribution of Trust (5) Accounting, (6) Constructive Trust, (7) Return of\r\n  Property, (8) Conversion, (9) Tortious Interference with Expected Inheritance,\r\n  and (10) Return of Ill Gotten Gain.Â  \r\n[3] The Order did not specify which causes of action, if\r\n  any, were being dismissed.Â Â  Furthermore, Respondents conceded in oral argument\r\n  that the Order is limited only to Donnaâ€™s third cause of action for fraud.Â Â  \r\n[4] We note that the survivability statue was enacted in South Carolina to alleviate the â€œharshness and injustice of the common-law rule that a\r\n  personal right of action dies with the person.â€ Page v. Lewis, 203 S.C.\r\n  190, Â­Â­Â­190, 26 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1943).Â  The effect of the survivability\r\n  statute is to â€œadd to, but . . . not diminish the classes of causes of action\r\n  which survive at common law.â€ Id.Â  Accordingly, those actions that would\r\n  survive at common law are not affected by the statute. See id.Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  at common law, the maxim â€œ[a]ctio personalis moritur cum persona,â€ which denied\r\n  survivability of an action ex delicto, was not applied to cases or causes of\r\n  action within the jurisdiction of equity. Id. \r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, Donna pleads, in addition to her legal causes of action,\r\n  various causes of action falling under the jurisdiction of equity, including accounting\r\n  and constructive trust.Â  Respondent has conceded, and we agree, that the Order\r\n  does not operate to bar causes of action in equity or other causes of action\r\n  not otherwise barred by the laws of this State.Â  \r\n[5] South Carolina Regulation of Manufacturers,\r\n  Distributors and Dealers Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-15-10 thru 56-15-130 (1976).\r\n[6] Initially we note that Donna has failed to establish\r\n  that the ex parte communication amounted to anything more than ex parte scheduling,\r\n  which is specifically allowed under the Canons of Judicial Ethics.Â  We also\r\n  find it noteworthy that the trial judge denied the accusations of improper\r\n  conduct no fewer than five times. \r\n[7] We are sensitive to the\r\n  fact that an oral recusal may have more significant effects on the litigants\r\n  and the case as a whole, as compared to other oral orders. However, of\r\n  paramount significance in the case at hand is that the trial judge found\r\n  â€œabsolutely no basis for [him] to recuse [himself].â€Â  Rather the recusal seemed\r\n  to be one of courtesy to Donnaâ€™s attorney, in an effort to avoid even the\r\n  slightest appearance of impropriety.Â  In the absence of a true basis for\r\n  recusal affecting the denial of the motion to amend and in light of the summary\r\n  judgment motion being properly granted, Donna was not prejudiced by the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s decision to rule on the Rule 59(e) motion.\r\n[8] Counsel for Donna brings to this Courtâ€™s attention\r\n  that both Georgia and Florida employ such a rule.Â  Georgia has achieved this\r\n  objective through statute in the Uniform Superior Court Rules.Â  GA USCR 25.3\r\n  (1991).Â  On the other hand Florida has developed a common law rule which\r\n  achieves substantially the same purpose as the Georgia statute. Robbie v. Robbie, 726 So.2d 817, 821 (Fla. Dist.\r\n  Ct. App. 1999); see Fuster-Escalona v. Witosky, 715 So.2d 1053,\r\n  1054 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (holding that the trial judge erred in ruling\r\n  on a motion to dismiss while a motion for recusal was pending).\r\n[9] Assuming, arguendo, this Court were to adopt the rule\r\n  proposed by Donna and find that the rule was violated in this case, such an\r\n  error would ultimately prove harmless.Â  Having found the predicate summary\r\n  judgment proper, to reverse the denial of the motion to amend would simply\r\n  remand the issue only to be again denied based on our determination as to the\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Such an outcome is inefficient and illogical. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4457","title":"Pelzer v.

Pelzer's plea counsel\r\n  was ineffective and in granting Pelzer relief from one part of a negotiated\r\n  guilty plea but leaving the rest of the plea intact.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2001, after six years of cohabitation resulting in the\r\n  birth of two children, Diana Gibbs required Ricky Pelzer leave their home.Â  On\r\n  April 20, 2001, Gibbs obtained a restraining order against Pelzer.Â  In the\r\n  early hours of May 6, 2001, Pelzer, carrying a can of gasoline, went to the\r\n  home where Gibbs and two of her children were sleeping.Â  When Gibbs refused to\r\n  let him in, Pelzer forced the door open.Â  Gibbs and the children ran out the\r\n  back door.Â  Pelzer followed them into the front yard, where he attacked Gibbs.Â \r\n  After Gibbs's son pulled Pelzer off Gibbs, Pelzer returned to the house.Â \r\n  Threatening to burn the house, Pelzer doused the inside of the home with\r\n  gasoline and began ingesting gasoline himself.Â  Gibbs called the police from a\r\n  neighbor's house.Â  The police eventually took Pelzer into custody and drove him\r\n  to a hospital, where he was successfully treated for gasoline ingestion.Â  \r\nPelzer was charged with first-degree burglary, attempted second-degree\r\n  arson, criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN), and\r\n  violation of a family court restraining order.Â  An attorney was appointed to\r\n  represent him.Â  After extensive negotiations between Attorney and the State,\r\n  Pelzer pled guilty to the lesser included offense of second-degree burglary and\r\n  the original charges of attempted second-degree arson and violation of a family\r\n  court restraining order.Â  The State nolle-prossed the CDVHAN charge.Â  In\r\n  accordance with the negotiated deal, the circuit court sentenced Pelzer to a\r\n  total of fifteen years' imprisonment.[1]Â  \r\nPelzer later learned of attempt to burn, a statutory offense\r\n  similar to the charged offense of attempted arson.Â  Attempt to burn carried a shorter\r\n  sentence than attempted arson.Â  Pelzer then filed an application for PCR,\r\n  arguing in his petition that his plea counsel was ineffective because she\r\n  failed to apprise him of attempt to burn, which carried only a five-year\r\n  sentence.Â  The attorney testified at the PCR hearing that she did not recall\r\n  discussing that statute with Pelzer.Â  The PCR court granted Pelzer's\r\n  application.Â  The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which was\r\n  granted.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the PCR court's decision, an appellate court is concerned only with\r\n  whether any evidence of probative value exists to support that decision.Â  Smith\r\n    v. State,&nbsp;369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261&nbsp;(2006).Â  Thus,\r\n  an appellate court gives great deference to the PCR court's findings of fact\r\n  and conclusions of law.Â  Porter v. State, 368 S.C. 378, 383, 629 S.E.2d\r\n  353, 356&nbsp;(2006).Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR court erred in finding Pelzer's plea counsel was\r\n  ineffective for failing to advise him of the attempt-to-burn statute.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nA\r\n  two-prong test exists to evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â \r\n  First, a defendant must show that his counsel's performance was deficient such\r\n  that it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Bennett v.\r\n    State, 371 S.C. 198, 203, 638 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2006) (citing Strickland\r\n      v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  Secondly, a defendant must establish\r\n  &quot;a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors,\r\n  the result of the proceeding would have been different.&quot;Â  Bennett,\r\n  371 S.C. at 203, 638 S.E.2d at 675.Â  &quot;Failure to make the required showing\r\n  of either deficient performance or sufficient prejudice defeats the\r\n  ineffectiveness claim.&quot;Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700.Â  \r\nTrial\r\n  counsel must provide &quot;reasonably effective assistance&quot; under &quot;prevailing\r\n  professional norms.&quot;Â  Id. at 687-88.Â  Reviewing courts presume\r\n  counsel was effective.Â  Id. at 690.Â  Therefore, to receive relief, the\r\n  applicant must show (1) counsel departed from professional norms resulting in\r\n  (2) prejudice.Â  Id. at 690, 693.Â  Trial counsel's failure to apprise the\r\n  accused of a lesser included offense constitutes deficient performance when,\r\n  under the facts of the case, he could be convicted of the lesser offense.Â  Kerrigan\r\n    v.

Â§ 16-11-110(B) (Supp. 2008).Â  To prove second-degree arson, the\r\n  State must show the accused willfully and maliciously caused an explosion, set\r\n  fire to, burned, or caused to be burned, or aided, counseled, or procured the\r\n  burning that resulted in damage to any structure designed for human occupancy.Â  Id.Â  An attempt to burn is punishable by imprisonment up to five years\r\n  or a fine of not more than $10,000.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-190 (2003).Â  To\r\n  prove attempt to burn, the State must show the accused willfully and\r\n  maliciously attempted &quot;to set fire to, burn, or aid, counsel, or procure\r\n  the burning of any of the buildings or property mentioned in Sections 16-11-110\r\n  to 16-11-140,&quot; or that the accused committed an act in furtherance of\r\n  burning these buildings.Â  Id.Â  \r\nFirst-degree\r\n  burglary is classified as a most serious offense in South Carolina, while\r\n  second-degree arson and second-degree burglary are classified as serious\r\n  offenses.Â  S.C.

U.S., 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932).Â  &quot;If\r\n  the lesser offense includes an element not included in the greater offense,\r\n  then the lesser offense is not included in the greater.&quot;Â  Hope v. State,\r\n  328 S.C. 78, 81, 492 S.E.2d 76, 78 (1997).Â  \r\nThe evidence\r\n  before us supports the PCR court's conclusion Attorney's performance failed the Strickland test for effective assistance of counsel.Â  Attorney's\r\n  assistance fell below prevailing professional norms for criminal defense\r\n  counsel when she failed to advise Pelzer that had he gone to trial, he could have\r\n  been convicted of attempt to burn, a less serious offense than second-degree\r\n  arson.Â  Although the PCR court did not determine whether attempt to burn was a\r\n  lesser included offense of attempted second-degree arson, we hold it is.Â  Upon\r\n  review of the elements of each offense, we find attempted second-degree arson\r\n  contains all the elements of attempt to burn.[3]Â \r\n  Therefore, attempt to burn is a lesser included offense of attempted\r\n  second-degree arson.Â  Given the facts of this case, Attorney's failure to\r\n  advise Pelzer of this offense fell below prevailing professional norms and was\r\n  deficient under Strickland.Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  concluded Attorney departed from prevailing professional standards, we now turn\r\n  to a discussion of whether Pelzer suffered prejudice as a result of Attorney's deficient\r\n  advice.Â  At the PCR stage, to show prejudice, Pelzer bore the burden of\r\n  establishing that but for the misadvice of Attorney, he would not have pled\r\n  guilty, but instead would have elected to go to trial. Alexander v. State,\r\n  303 S.C. 539, 542, 402 S.E.2d 484, 485 (1991).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the PCR judge found in her order that Pelzer &quot;testified at the hearing\r\n  that he would not have plead [sic] guilty to the charges had he known that the\r\n  attempt to burn statute was the applicable statute,&quot; we are unable to\r\n  locate that testimony anywhere in the record.Â  Moreover, the thrust of Pelzer's\r\n  plea counsel's testimony was that from the outset, the solicitor insisted on\r\n  trying Pelzer on the original charge of first-degree burglary, which in Pelzer's\r\n  case carried a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole\r\n  since Pelzer had a prior conviction of assault and battery with intent to\r\n  kill.Â  She stated, &quot;[W]e were, from the early outset, working toward a\r\n  plea,&quot; and Pelzer's principal reason for entering into the negotiated plea\r\n  was to avoid facing trial on the original burglary charge.Â  She stated further\r\n  that she believed there was &quot;a significant risk that [Pelzer] would be\r\n  found guilty if he went to trial&quot; on the first-degree burglary charge.Â \r\n  Because Pelzer did not want to face the first-degree burglary charge, he\r\n  requested his plea counsel negotiate the firstÂ­-degree burglary charge down to\r\n  second-degree burglary to avoid the possibility of a sentence of life without\r\n  the possibility of parole.\r\nDuring\r\n  the guilty plea colloquy, the plea judge thoroughly discussed with Pelzer his\r\n  decision to plead guilty and the terms of the negotiated plea.Â  Additionally,\r\n  as noted previously, at the PCR hearing, Pelzer never testified that he would\r\n  not have pled guilty except for his plea counsel's error.Â  In fact, he\r\n  specifically testified he did not wish to set aside his guilty plea to\r\n  the burglary charge.Â  The following colloquy between Pelzer and his PCR\r\n  attorney is instructive:Â  \r\n\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  You\r\n    don't want to try to go back to the beginning and start completely over.\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  No.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  I\r\n    just want to argue 190.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  All\r\n    you want to argue is that your lawyer was ineffective in allowing you to be\r\n    sentenced under 110(B) as opposed to arguing that on the facts of this case\r\n    that you were properly â€“ should have properly been sentenced under 190.\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  That's\r\n    correct.\r\n\r\nIn view of this testimony, we\r\n  conclude the evidence does not demonstrate that there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\n  proceeding would have been different.Â  Consequently, the PCR court erred in\r\n  finding Pelzer suffered prejudice as a result of his plea counsel's misadvice.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State also argues the PCR court erred in granting Pelzer relief as to the arson\r\n  charge, only, without vacating the entire plea.Â  Inasmuch as we have reversed\r\n  the PCR court on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, we do not\r\n  reach this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need\r\n  not review remaining issues when\r\n  its determination of a prior issue is dispositive\r\n  of the appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the PCR court did not err in finding Pelzer's plea counsel performed\r\n  deficiently by failing to advise him of the attempt-to-burn statute because\r\n  attempt-to-burn is a lesser included offense of arson.Â  Nevertheless, we hold\r\n  Pelzer suffered no prejudice because of this misadvice, because he has not\r\n  demonstrated that he would not have pled guilty but for the misadvice.Â \r\n  Therefore, we reverse the order of the PCR court and reinstate Pelzer's\r\n  conviction.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  do not reach the issue of whether the PCR court erred in granting Pelzer relief\r\n  as to the arson charge, only, without vacating\r\n  the entire guilty plea.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  order of the PCR court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\nC.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This sentence included fifteen years each for the\r\n  burglary and arson charges and thirty days for violating the family court's\r\nrestraining order, all to be served concurrently.Â  \r\n[2] &quot;A person who commits the common law offense of\r\n  attempt, upon conviction, must be punished as for the principal offense.&quot;Â \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;16-1-80 (2003).Â  \r\n[3] In addition to the elements found in the attempt-to-burn\r\n  statute, the second-degree arson statute requires property damage and allows\r\n  culpability for causing an explosion, apparently as an alternative to burning.Â \r\nÂ§ 16-11-110(B).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4458","title":"McClurg v.

Patterson, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J.:Â  Harrell Wayne Deaton and New Prime, Inc. appeal from\r\n  an order of the trial court denying their motions to set aside a default\r\n  judgment in favor of Ann F. and Steve McClurg in the amount of $800,000.Â  We\r\n  affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nAnn McClurg, along with her husband Steve, instituted this action\r\n  for injuries Ann received as\r\n  a passenger in a car involved in an August 5, 2002 motor vehicle accident with\r\n  a truck owned by New Prime and driven by New Primeâ€™s employee, Deaton.Â  New\r\n  Prime was insured by Zurich North America under a commercial truckerâ€™s general\r\n  liability policy containing a $2,000,000 deductible endorsement for liability\r\n  claims for each accident.Â  Zurich was notified of the accident almost\r\n  immediately and began investigating the matter shortly thereafter.\r\nIn the following month of September 2002, Zurich received a letter\r\n  of representation from the McClurgsâ€™ counsel, beginning a course of contact\r\n  between Zurich and counsel regarding injuries, medical treatment and settlement\r\n  negotiations.Â  Deaton left the employment of New Prime in October 2002, a\r\n  little over two months following the accident, and there was no record of any\r\n  communication between Deaton and New Prime during this time of negotiation\r\n  subsequent to Deatonâ€™s separation from employment.Â  On April 23, 2004, Zurich received a proposed settlement package from counsel.Â  On June 28, 2004, counsel sent\r\n  Zurich a letter regarding â€œAnn D. McClurg and Steve McClurg v. New Prime and\r\n  Harrell Wayne Deaton.â€Â Â  The letter requested settlement within the next week\r\n  and stated, â€œIf I havenâ€™t heard from you by that time, I will file suit and\r\n  serve the Defendant and send you a courtesy copy of the pleadings.â€Â  On October\r\n  6, 2004, counsel sent Zurich another letter, enclosing a copy of a complaint he\r\n  prepared in the matter and indicating his intent to â€œproceed to litigationâ€ if\r\n  the matter was not soon settled.Â  The draft complaint named only Ann McClurg as\r\n  a plaintiff and New Prime as a defendant, and alleged New Prime was vicariously\r\n  liable for Deatonâ€™s actions and was also liable for its negligent hiring,\r\n  retention, and training of Deaton.Â  On October 18, 2004, Zurich contacted\r\n  counsel, who agreed to delay filing suit while Zurich reviewed the settlement\r\n  demand.Â  Between November 2004 and June 2005, Zurich and counsel exchanged\r\n  telephone messages in regard to settlement, but did not reach a final agreement\r\n  on the matter.\r\nUnbeknownst to Zurich and New Prime, counsel filed a summons and\r\n  complaint on April 27, 2005, naming only Deaton as a defendant.Â  The complaint\r\n  was filed on behalf of Ann McClurg, for injuries sustained in the accident, and\r\n  her husband Steve, for loss of consortium.Â  On May 3, 2005, the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Motor Vehicles (the Department) received a copy of the summons\r\n  and complaint pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-350 and, on that same\r\n  date, sent a copy of the summons and complaint by certified mail to Deaton at\r\n  the Texas address listed on the accident report, but it was later returned as\r\n  â€œInsufficient Address.â€Â  On June 27, 2005, the Department again received the\r\n  summons and complaint and sent the summons and complaint to Deaton via\r\n  certified mail, this time to a different address in Texas, found through the\r\n  efforts of a private investigator hired by counsel.Â  This time the return\r\n  receipt indicated it was received by Deaton, as evidenced by signature.Â  Deaton\r\n  did not answer or otherwise appear, and an order of default was filed on August\r\n  1, 2005.Â  Notice of a damages hearing was sent to Deaton at both Texas addresses, but Deaton again failed to respond or appear.Â  In September 2005, judgment\r\n  was entered against Deaton in favor of Ann McClurg in the amount of $750,000\r\n  and in favor of Steve McClurg in the amount of $50,000 for a total judgment of\r\n  $800,000.\r\nOn October 5, 2005, Zurich contacted counselâ€™s office to determine\r\n  the status of the settlement negotiations.Â  After counselâ€™s staff would not\r\n  divulge any information, Zurich contacted New Prime to confirm New Prime had\r\n  not been served with a summons and complaint in the matter.Â  On October 7,\r\n  2005, Zurich received by certified mail a copy of the default judgment entered\r\n  against Deaton.Â  After the services of several private investigators were\r\n  engaged, Deaton was finally located on January 23, 2006.Â  On that date, Deaton\r\n  executed an affidavit denying he was served with a copy of the summons and\r\n  complaint, or received notice of the entry of default or the default judgment\r\n  hearing, and stating he did not notify New Prime or Zurich of the above because\r\n  he never received notice.Â  Thus, it appears undisputed that neither Zurich nor New Prime was aware a complaint had been filed in the matter until October 7,\r\n  2005 when Zurich received a copy of the default judgment entered against\r\n  Deaton.Â  Notably, on May 11, 2005, after the summons and complaint were already\r\n  filed by counsel and sent by the Department to Deaton at the first address,\r\n  counsel continued the path of negotiation with Zurich, sending Zurich an additional medical report concerning the underlying cause of action.\r\nDeaton moved to set aside the default judgment pursuant to Rules\r\n  60(b)(1) and 60(b)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  New\r\n  Prime filed a motion to intervene and likewise moved to set aside the judgment\r\n  pursuant to Rules 60(b)(1) and 60(b)(3).Â  The trial court granted New Primeâ€™s\r\n  motion to intervene, but denied both New Primeâ€™s and Deatonâ€™s motions to set\r\n  aside the default judgment.Â  Both New Prime and Deaton made motions for\r\n  reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which the trial judge denied\r\n  with the exception of deleting some language from the order not at issue in\r\n  this appeal.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\nA.Â  New Primeâ€™s Appeal\r\n1.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court err in failing to recognize New Primeâ€™s status as a party and afford New\r\n  Prime due process rights?\r\n2.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court commit an abuse of discretion in denying New Prime relief from judgment\r\n  based on surprise?\r\n3.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court commit an abuse of discretion in denying New Prime relief from judgment\r\n  based on misrepresentation and misconduct by Respondentsâ€™ attorney?\r\nB.Â  Deatonâ€™s Appeal\r\n1.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court err in failing to set aside the default judgment when it was procured\r\n  based on fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct inasmuch as Respondentsâ€™\r\n  counsel actively concealed the lawsuit so no defense would be entered?\r\n2.Â  Did the trial\r\n  court err in failing to set aside the default judgment under Rule 60, SCRCP,\r\n  when Deaton demonstrated that he was not properly served with the summons and\r\n  complaint and that he did not receive notice of the hearing on unliquidated\r\n  damages?\r\n3.Â  Should the\r\n  default judgment be set aside because the actual judgment entered was\r\n  incongruent with the damages alleged in the pleadings? \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a motion for relief from judgment lies within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  BB &amp; T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 501, 502-03 (2006).Â  Thus, our standard of review limits this court to\r\n  determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.Â  Id.Â  â€œAn\r\n  abuse of discretion arises where the judge issuing the order was controlled by\r\n  an error of law or where the order is based on factual conclusions that are\r\n  without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 503\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  New Primeâ€™s Appeal\r\nNew\r\n  Prime contends the trial court erred in failing to recognize its status as a\r\n  party to the action after the court granted its motion to intervene, and\r\n  denying New Prime relief on this basis.Â  We agree.Â  Nonetheless, we find the\r\n  order denying New Primeâ€™s motion to set aside judgment must be affirmed on\r\n  other grounds.\r\nNew\r\n  Prime presented evidence that, based upon a federally mandated MCS-90\r\n  Endorsement contained in the applicable insurance policy, any\r\n  noncooperation/late notice defense which might have been available due to\r\n  Deatonâ€™s failure to notify New Prime of the lawsuit could be completely\r\n  eliminated, thereby leaving New Prime vulnerable to being responsible for the\r\n  entire judgment.Â  The trial court granted New Primeâ€™s motion to intervene,\r\n  recognizing New Primeâ€™s large financial interest in the action and possible\r\n  responsibility for paying the judgment.Â  Despite this determination by the\r\n  trial court, it partially denied New Primeâ€™s motion to set aside the default\r\n  judgment finding, in regard to New Primeâ€™s Rule 60(b)(1) motion that New Prime\r\n  was not a party to the action, and therefore the McClurgs had no legal duty to\r\n  serve New Prime with the action against Deaton or notify New Prime of the\r\n  default proceedings against Deaton.Â  The court therefore determined the\r\n  evidence did not support the relief from judgment based on mistake, inadvertence,\r\n  surprise or excusable neglect.Â  In regard to New Primeâ€™s Rule 60(b)(3) motion,\r\n  the court found New Prime was not a party to the action and consequently had no\r\n  legal duty to notify New Prime or Zurich of the lawsuit, and therefore New\r\n  Prime could not make a Rule 60(b)(3) motion to be relieved from judgment based\r\n  on fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.Â  We find\r\n  the trial court erred in holding New Prime was not a party to the action and,\r\n  because it was not legally entitled to notice or service, could not show\r\n  entitlement to relief under Rules 60(b)(1) or (3).\r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  60(b), SCRCP provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOn\r\n  motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his\r\n  legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\r\n  following reasons:\r\n\t\t(1)\r\n  mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n\t\t.\r\n  . .\r\n\t\t(3)\r\n  fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nNew\r\n  Prime was clearly made a party to the action based upon the courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  grant its motion to intervene.Â  Therefore, as a party, it was within the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s discretion to grant New Prime relief from the final judgment entered if\r\n  the relief was warranted.Â  Further, the case ofÂ  Edwards v. Ferguson,\r\n  254 S.C. 278, 175 S.E.2d 224 (1970) indicates an insurer may, under the proper\r\n  circumstances, be entitled to an order setting aside a default judgment where\r\n  the insurer is involved in ongoing negotiations with a claimant but is not\r\n  informed that the defendant has been served with a summons and complaint.Â  \r\nIn Edwards,\r\n  Ferguson and his liability insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance\r\n  Company, moved to set aside a personal injury default judgment on the ground\r\n  that the same was taken through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable\r\n  neglect.Â  The case involved an August 6, 1967 single-car motor vehicle accident\r\n  wherein there was a dispute as to whether Ferguson or Edwards was driving the\r\n  car.Â  Fourteen months after the accident, State Farm received a letter from\r\n  Edwardsâ€™ attorney advising of Edwardsâ€™ claim and requesting negotiation of a\r\n  settlement.Â  A settlement of the case did not develop, and on December 2, 1968,\r\n  a copy of the summons and complaint was served on Fergusonâ€™s father who, according\r\n  to Ferguson, was illiterate.Â  The trial court found, however, that service was\r\n  made on the father and, subsequently, Ferguson acknowledged he found a copy of\r\n  the summons and complaint in his dresser drawer.Â  On June 12, 1969, the trial\r\n  court entered judgment against Ferguson and a little over one month later, Ferguson and State Farm moved to set aside the judgment.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion.Â  On appeal, the supreme court found State Farm â€œstands in the shoes of\r\n  [its insured] so far as liability is concerned,â€ and that Fergusonâ€™s failure to\r\n  cooperate prejudiced State Farm.Â  Id. at 282, 175 S.E.2d at 226.Â  The\r\n  court reversed the trial court, finding the trial court abused its discretion\r\n  in failing to set aside the default judgment on the grounds of mistake,\r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.Â  Id. at 283, 175 S.E.2d at\r\n  226.Â  However, the supreme court further determined there was a prima facie\r\n  showing of a meritorious defense made by Ferguson.[1] \r\nHere,\r\n  it is undisputed Zurich, as New Primeâ€™s insurer, entered into settlement\r\n  negotiations with the McClurgsâ€™ attorney.Â  In June 2004, counsel sent Zurich a letter in regard to â€œAnn D.\r\n  McClurg and Steve McClurg v. New Prime and Harrell Wayne Deaton,â€ thus\r\n  indicating an intention to file suit against both Deaton and New Prime.Â  The\r\n  letter further requested settlement within the next week and stated counsel\r\n  would file suit and serve the Defendant and send Zurich a courtesy copy of the\r\n  pleadings.Â  In OctoberÂ  2004, counsel sent Zurich another letter, enclosing a\r\n  copy of a draft complaint naming only New Prime as a defendant and raising\r\n  allegations solely against New Prime of vicarious liability for Deatonâ€™s\r\n  actions as well as liability for New Primeâ€™s negligent hiring, retention, and\r\n  training of Deaton.Â Â Â  Â \r\nBased\r\n  on counselâ€™s conduct and actions, it was reasonable for Zurich and New Prime to\r\n  believe that any suit filed would include New Prime as a defendant or, at the\r\n  very least, that counsel would provide Zurich a copy of any pleadings in the\r\n  matter when filed.Â  Thus, at a minimum, the facts show New Prime was taken by\r\n  surprise when counsel filed the action solely against Deaton and failed to\r\n  inform Zurich or New Prime of this action, thereby meeting the surprise or\r\n  excusable neglect requirement under Rule 60(b)(1).Â  Additionally, given this\r\n  history of contact and negotiations between counsel and Zurich, most notably\r\n  the representations made by counsel to Zurich, the conduct of the McClurgsâ€™\r\n  counsel in failing to simply notify Zurich of the complaint filed against\r\n  Deaton raises serious concerns for this court and quite possibly satisfies the\r\n  misrepresentation and misconduct envisioned by Rule 60(b)(3).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  believe the trial court committed error in finding the evidence did not, at\r\n  least, support relief based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable\r\n  neglect.Â  Further, we find the trial court erred in its implicit finding that\r\n  because New Prime was not a party to the initial lawsuit it could not make a\r\n  Rule 60(b) motion.Â  The Edwards case makes clear that a Rule 60(b)\r\n  motion is properly made by an insurer under such circumstances. Nonetheless,\r\n  this court is compelled to affirm based on the trial courtâ€™s determination that\r\n  New Prime failed to make a showing of a meritorious defense.\r\nOur\r\n  courts have noted, in determining whether to set aside a default judgment under\r\n  Rule 60(b), the trial judge should consider the following relevant factors: Â (1)\r\n  the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the reasons for the failure to\r\n  act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious defense, and (4) the prejudice\r\n  to the other parties.Â  Tobias v. Rice, 379 S.C. 357, 366, 665 S.E.2d\r\n  216, 221 (Ct. App. 2008); Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345\r\n  S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001); Hill v. Dotts,\r\n  345 S.C. 304, 309, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001); New Hampshire Ins.\r\n    Co. v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47, 50, 435 S.E.2d 377, 378 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  It\r\n  is clear, however, that a meritorious defense is more than merely a factor to\r\n  consider under certain 60(b) grounds for setting aside default judgments.Â  In\r\n  particular, our courts have held that in order to obtain relief from a default\r\n  judgment under Rule 60(b)(1) or 60(b)(3), not only must the movant make a\r\n  proper showing he is entitled to relief based upon one of the specified\r\n  grounds, he must also make a prima facie showing of a meritorious defense.Â  See Stearns Bank Natâ€™l Assâ€™n v. Glenwood Falls, LP, 373 S.C. 331, 341, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 793, 798 (Ct. App. 2007) (noting relief from a default judgment under\r\n  Rule 60(b)(1) is available â€œupon a showing of excusable neglect and a\r\n  meritorious defense; case law also directs the trial court to consider the\r\n  presence or absence of prejudice to the party opposing the motionâ€); Schultz\r\n    v.

(quoting Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C.\r\n  442, 248 S.E.2d 594 (1978)). Â A party making a motion under Rule 60(b) has the\r\n  burden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle him to\r\n  relief.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  as noted by the trial court, New Prime has failed to make any showing of a\r\n  meritorious defense.Â  There is no evidence of record, by affidavit or\r\n  otherwise, to suggest that the accident was the result of anything other than\r\n  Deatonâ€™s negligence.Â  In fact, a review of the record shows New Prime never\r\n  even raised the issue of a meritorious defense before the trial court.Â  New\r\n  Prime argues on appeal that it presented compelling evidence of a meritorious\r\n  defense as to damages based on a judgment award of $800,000 and the fact that\r\n  the McClurgs had earlier offered to settle the matter for a total of $170,000.Â \r\n  A review of the record shows merely an allegation in a Zurich employee\r\n  affidavit regarding a $170,000 settlement demand by the McClurgs made in April\r\n  2004 and a counteroffer of $35,000 made by Zurich in October 2004.Â  This\r\n  allegation in the affidavit appears to have been addressed in conjunction with\r\n  the contention that settlement negotiations were ongoing.Â  Nowhere in the\r\n  record is there any indication that New Prime raised this to the court as an\r\n  argument that a meritorious defense existed.Â  Thus, even assuming for the sake\r\n  of argument that this bare assertion regarding settlement negotiations is\r\n  evidence of a defense to the amount of damages, the argument is not preserved\r\n  for our review as it was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 217, 634 S.E.2d 51, 57 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding\r\n  when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to amend, the issue is not presented properly to an appellate\r\n  court for review).\r\nBecause\r\n  New Prime failed to make the necessary prima facie showing of a meritorious\r\n  defense required to set aside a judgment under Rules 60(b)(1) and 60(b)(3), the\r\n  trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing to set aside the\r\n  default judgment.Â  \r\nB.Â  Deatonâ€™s Appeal\r\nDeaton\r\n  first contends the trial court erred in failing to set aside the default\r\n  judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) when it was procured through fraud,\r\n  misrepresentation, or other misconduct.Â  He maintains that counsel for the\r\n  McClurgs agreed to notify Zurich of a lawsuit, but breached that agreement,\r\n  ensuring Zurich would have no reason to hire counsel for him.Â  He also points\r\n  to counselâ€™s negotiations and communications with Zurich, and the settlement\r\n  demands made to Zurich over the course of time. Â Deaton asserts the tactics\r\n  employed by the McClurgsâ€™ attorney were undertaken for the purpose of evading\r\n  full and fair litigation of the case on the merits.Â  However, Deaton fails to\r\n  show how counselâ€™s actions and inactions toward Zurich would equate to fraud,\r\n  misrepresentation, or other misconduct toward Deaton.Â  As noted by the trial\r\n  court, there is simply no evidence the McClurgsâ€™ counsel committed any kind of\r\n  fraud that deprived Deaton of the opportunity to be present or heard in the\r\n  matter, or that counsel made any misrepresentations to Deaton or engaged in any\r\n  misconduct toward Deaton.Â  At any rate, Deatonâ€™s argument fails for the same\r\n  reason that New Primeâ€™s fails on this issue.Â  Deaton failed to present any evidence\r\n  of a meritorious defense.\r\nDeaton\r\n  next maintains the trial court erred in failing to set aside the default\r\n  judgment under Rule 60, SCRCP, as he â€œunequivocally demonstrated he was not\r\n  properly served with the summons and complaint,â€ and did not receive notice of\r\n  the damages hearing.Â  He asserts, while the McClurgs claim he was properly\r\n  served pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-9-350 and 370, Deaton\r\n  presented evidence by way of his affidavit that he never received the summons\r\n  and complaint or notice of the damages hearing.Â  He maintains the trial court\r\n  failed to liberally apply Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP and ignored Deatonâ€™s affidavit\r\n  because there was not â€œconclusive proofâ€ that the signature on the return\r\n  receipt was that of Deatonâ€™s.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  ruling on Deatonâ€™s motion to vacate pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1), the trial court\r\n  found â€œDeaton received the Summons and Complaint on June 27, 2005 as evidenced\r\n  by the signed return-receipt.â€Â  The trial court noted the return receipt has\r\n  both the signature and the printed name of â€œWayne Deaton.â€Â  Although Deatonâ€™s\r\n  affidavit states he had not been served with the summons and complaint,\r\n  implying the signature was not his, the trial court noted Deatonâ€™s affidavit\r\n  failed to indicate that he resided at a different address than that used for\r\n  service at the time of service.Â  The court determined Deaton had failed to\r\n  provide the court with â€œconclusive proofâ€ that the signature on the return\r\n  receipt was not his.Â  Accordingly, the court held Deatonâ€™s reason for his failure\r\n  to answer the summons and complaint, in light of the evidence produced, did not\r\n  amount to excusable neglect under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  15-9-350 of the South Carolina Code provides as follows:\r\n\tThe\r\n  acceptance by a nonresident of the rights and privileges conferred by the laws\r\n  in force in this State permitting the operation of motor vehicles, as evidenced\r\n  by the operation of a motor vehicle by such nonresident on the public highways,\r\n  the streets of any incorporated municipality or the public roads of this State\r\n  or anywhere within this State, or the operation by such nonresident of a motor\r\n  vehicle on any such public highways, streets or public roads or anywhere within\r\n  the State other than as so permitted or regulated shall be deemed equivalent to\r\n  the appointment by such nonresident of the Director of the Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles or of his successor in office to be his true and lawful attorney upon\r\n  whom may be served all summons or other lawful process in any action or\r\n  proceeding against him growing out of any accident or collision in which such\r\n  nonresident may be involved by reason of the operation by him, for him or under\r\n  his control or direction, express or implied, of a motor vehicle on such public\r\n  highways, streets or public roads or anywhere within this State.Â  Such\r\n  acceptance or operation shall be a signification of his agreement that any such\r\n  process against him shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served\r\n  on him personally.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-350\r\n  (2005).Â  Section 15-9-370 of the code provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tService\r\n  of process upon the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles, as agent of\r\n  a:Â  (a) nonresident driver under the provisions of Section 15-9-350 . . . shall\r\n  be made by leaving a copy thereof, with an appropriate fee, in the hands of the\r\n  Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles or his office and such service\r\n  shall be sufficient service upon the nonresident if notice of the service and a\r\n  copy of the process are forthwith sent by certified mail by the plaintiff or\r\n  the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to the defendant and the\r\n  defendantâ€™s return receipt and the plaintiffâ€™s affidavit of compliance herewith\r\n  are appended to the summons or other process and filed with the summons,\r\n  complaint, and other papers in the cause.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-370\r\n  (2005).\r\nThe\r\n  record in this matter shows compliance with the requirements of Â§Â§ 15-9-350 and\r\n  370.Â  The summons and complaint in this matter was served upon the Department\r\n  which in turn, as an agent of Deaton, sent notice of the service and a copy of\r\n  the summons and complaint to Deaton by certified mail.Â  The return receipt from\r\n  this certified delivery included the signature and hand-printed name of â€œWayne\r\n  Deaton.â€Â  Deatonâ€™s affidavit states that he was not served with the summons and\r\n  complaint and that he did not receive notice of the entry of default and\r\n  default judgment hearing in this case, and indicates what his address was at\r\n  the time of the accident.Â  It does not, however, indicate the address used for\r\n  service was incorrect.\r\nOur\r\n  courts have long held that in order to establish that service has been properly\r\n  effected, the plaintiff need only show compliance with the civil rules on\r\n  service of process.Â  McCall v. IKON, 363 S.C. 646, 652, 611 S.E.2d 315,\r\n  317 (Ct. App. 2005); Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473\r\n  S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  When these rules are followed, there is a presumption\r\n  of proper service.Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C.\r\n  207, 211, 456 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1995).Â  The McClurgs showed compliance with the\r\n  rules, and therefore service was presumptively proper.Â  As previously noted, a\r\n  party making a motion under Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence\r\n  proving the facts essential to entitle him to relief.Â  Bowers v. Bowers,\r\n  304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The trial court made a\r\n  factual determination, one clearly supported by the evidence, that Deaton did\r\n  in fact receive the summons and complaint, and his simple denial of the same\r\n  was insufficient to show mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable\r\n  neglect.Â  Cf. Fassett v. Evans, 364 S.C. 42, 47, 610 S.E.2d 841,\r\n  844 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that an officerâ€™s return of process creates the\r\n  legal presumption of proper service that cannot be impeached by the mere denial\r\n  of service by the defendant).Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s refusal to set aside the default judgment as to Deaton\r\n  pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\nDeaton\r\n  lastly argues the default judgment should be set aside because the actual\r\n  judgment entered was incongruent with the damages alleged in the pleadings.Â  He\r\n  contends that included within the courtâ€™s award for Ann McClurg were damages\r\n  for â€œin kind services,â€ and while Steve McClurg requested â€œin kind servicesâ€\r\n  damages in his loss of consortium claim, Ann McClurg failed to allege such a\r\n  loss in her complaint.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  first time Deaton raised this argument was in his motion to reconsider.Â  Deaton\r\n  clearly could have raised the matter in his motion to set aside the default\r\n  judgment but failed to do so.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for\r\n  review.Â  See Kiawah Prop. Owners Group v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 359\r\n  S.C. 105, 113, 597 S.E.2d 145, 149 (2004) (a party may not raise an issue in a\r\n  motion to reconsider, alter or amend a judgment that could have been presented\r\n  prior to the judgment).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s order denying New Primeâ€™s and Deatonâ€™s\r\n  motions to set aside the default judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J., concurs.Â  HEARN, C.J., concurrs in part and dissents in part.\r\nHEARN, C.J. (concurring in\r\n  part and dissenting in part):Â  \r\nI respectfully\r\n  concur in part, and dissent in\r\n  part.Â  I would reverse the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Deaton and New Primeâ€™s Rule\r\n  60(b), SCRCP motion, and remand for a full trial on the merits. \r\nI agree with the majority that the circuit court erred in denying New Prime\r\n  relief on the basis that it was not a party, after previously granting its\r\n  motion to intervene.Â  However, I part company with the majority in holding that\r\n  neither party satisfied the requirement of a meritorious defense under Rule\r\n  60(b).Â  \r\nÂ â€œIn\r\n  determining whether to grant a motion under Rule 60(b), the trial judge should\r\n  consider:Â  (1) the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the reasons for\r\n  the failure to act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious defense, and\r\n  (4) the prejudice to the other party.â€Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Here,\r\n  there is no question that New Prime acted promptly in seeking relief under Rule\r\n  60(b) as soon as it learned that default judgment had been taken against\r\n  Deaton.Â  The McClurgs made no showing of how they would be prejudiced if the\r\n  default judgment were to be set aside, and the law favors the resolution of\r\n  disputes based upon all parties having their day in court.Â  Thus, the trial\r\n  court hinged its denial of relief upon the Appellantsâ€™ failure to establish a\r\n  meritorious defense.Â  I would hold this was error.\r\nUnder the\r\n  majorityâ€™s view, Appellants had to establish a meritorious defense as to\r\n  liability in order to prevail on their Rule 60(b) motion.Â  I agree there was no\r\n  showing by Appellants concerning Deatonâ€™s lack of responsibility for causing\r\n  the accident, but I would hold there was evidence of a meritorious defense,\r\n  provided by the McClurgsâ€™ own attorney, which related to the amount of\r\n  damages.Â  In negotiations with New Primeâ€™s carrier, Zurich, which were ongoing\r\n  prior to and beyond the filing of suit, McClurgsâ€™ counsel made a settlement\r\n  demand of $170,000.Â  I would hold this course of conduct by McClurgsâ€™ attorney\r\n  is sufficient to satisfy Rule 60(b)â€™s meritorious defense requirement.Â \r\n  Although not previously recognized in South Carolina, courts in other\r\n  jurisdictions have held that in the context of a Rule 60(b) motion, an\r\n  allegation that the amount of damages could be different from what was awarded\r\n  under the default judgment, is sufficient to satisfy the meritorious defense\r\n  requirement.Â  See e.g. Augusta Fiberglass Coatings, Inc. v.\r\n    Fodor Contracting Corp., 843 F.2d 808 (4th Cir. 1988); Wainrightâ€™s\r\n      Vacations, L.L.C. v.

Berzanske, 704 P.2d 767 (Alaska 1985).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nI\r\n  also disagree with the majorityâ€™s holding that Appellants did not preserve this\r\n  issue for appellate review.Â  Our preservation rules exist to ensure that issues\r\n  argued on appeal were fairly presented and ruled upon at the trial level.Â \r\n  McClurgsâ€™ counselâ€™s settlement demand was clearly argued to the circuit court\r\n  and referenced in memoranda and affidavits submitted at the motion hearing.Â \r\n  The circuit court held that New Prime and Deaton failed to make any showing of\r\n  a meritorious defense.Â  Therefore, I would find this argument was raised and\r\n  ruled upon, and is thus properly before this court.\r\nÂ I\r\n  join the majorityâ€™s serious concern with the conduct of the McClurgsâ€™ counsel in\r\n  the manner in which he pursued this case.Â  While no duty technically existed to\r\n  notify New Prime or Zurich of the filing of suit against Deaton, the failure to\r\n  do so under the circumstances of this case compromises the high ethical\r\n  standards attaching to the practice of law.Â  As the majority points out, the\r\n  McClurgs indicated in correspondence to Zurich that New Prime would be served\r\n  as a defendant in the event a settlement could not be reached, stating\r\n  emphatically:Â  â€œIf I havenâ€™t heard from [Zurich] by that time, I will file suit\r\n  and serve the Defendant and send you a courtesy copy of the pleadings.â€Â  The\r\n  maxim that a lawyerâ€™s word is his bond is not only a time-honored tradition; it\r\n  is included as a guiding principle in the South Carolina Barâ€™s Standards of\r\n  Professionalism. \r\nMoreover,\r\n  during negotiations, the McClurgsâ€™ counsel sent a copy of his proposed\r\n  complaint to New Prime which showed both New Prime and Deaton as defendants.Â \r\n  However, the complaint ultimately served on Deaton made no mention of New Prime\r\n  as a defendant.Â  Inexplicably, less than a month after filing the complaint\r\n  against Deaton, McClurgsâ€™ counsel appeared to be continuing settlement\r\n  negotiations with New Prime by sending it an additional medical report.\r\nWhile\r\n  the facts presented here â€“ the failure to serve an insurance company where\r\n  there is a clear and established prior course of dealings between the carrier\r\n  and the plaintiff â€“ appear to present a novel situation in South Carolina,[2] the Indiana Court of Appeals addressed a similar situation in McGee v.\r\n    Reynolds, 618 N.E.2d 40 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993).Â  There, two parties were\r\n  involved in an automobile accident andÂ Â  negotiations ensued between the\r\n  injured party and the at-fault driverâ€™s insurance company. When those\r\n  negotiations reached an impasse, the injured party filed suit against the\r\n  at-fault party without notifying the insurance company.Â  Similar problems of\r\n  service arose, and in the meantime, the insurance company made an inquiry as to\r\n  the claimâ€™s status, only to receive no response.Â  Finally, a default judgment\r\n  was obtained, and after notice of the judgment, the at-fault driver and insurer\r\n  moved to set aside the according to Rule 60(B)(3).Â  \r\nThe McGee court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant the at-fault driverâ€™s motion\r\n  to set aside the default judgment where the plaintiffâ€™s attorney failed to give\r\n  notice of the lawsuit to defendantâ€™s insurer.Â  Id. at 41.Â  The court\r\n  described the plaintiff attorneyâ€™s behavior as bad faith and â€œsmack[ing] of\r\n  chicanery and unfair advantageâ€ which could not be tolerated.Â  Id.Â  Further, in reaching its decision, the McGee court referenced Boles\r\n    v. Wiedner, 449 N.E.2d 288, 290 (Ind. 1983) and stated: \r\n\r\n\tWhile\r\n  there is no general duty to inform the defendantâ€™s insurer of a lawsuit, in Boles,\r\n  the supreme court concluded the plaintiffâ€™s failure to notify the defendantâ€™s\r\n  insurer of the existence of the lawsuit after negotiations had occurred was a\r\n  valid consideration in determining whether to set aside a default judgment.Â  Â \r\n\r\nId.Â  The Boles court had determined that failure\r\n  to notify the insurer, standing alone, was not enough to justify setting aside\r\n  the default judgment.Â  However, in McGee, the court held that the\r\n  failure to serve the insurer after negotiations were undertaken, when combined\r\n  with the attorneyâ€™s refusal to answer the direct inquiry by the insurance\r\n  company as to the status of the claim, constituted grounds for relief.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  case before us is factually very similar to McGee.Â  Here, McClurgsâ€™\r\n  counsel continued to negotiate with Zurich while filing a complaint against the\r\n  at-fault driver without notice to New Prime or its carrier, despite his prior\r\n  written assurance that he would send Zurich a courtesy copy.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  actual complaint served on Deaton was markedly different from the copy counsel\r\n  had sent to Zurich, in that New Prime was no longer named as a defendant.Â  \r\nÂ I\r\n  fully recognize that this court has not been asked to adopt a bright-line rule\r\n  with respect to service of complaints on carriers where settlement negotiations\r\n  have been ongoing; nevertheless, counselâ€™s actions in continuing to uphold the\r\n  appearance of settlement negotiations while simultaneously pursuing a default\r\n  judgment without notice to Zurich, when coupled with the evidence of a\r\n  meritorious defense as to damages, certainly warrants the grant of New Prime\r\n  and Deatonâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  I concur in part and dissent in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In Edwards, evidence was presented that Ferguson was intoxicated, that Edwards was aware of his intoxication, and Edwards, not Ferguson, was the person driving the car at the time of the accident. Â Edwards, 254\r\n  S.C. at 281, 175 S.E.2d at 225.Â  Accordingly, the supreme court determined a\r\n  prima facie showing of meritorious defenses was presented to the court: (1) that\r\n  Ferguson was not driving the vehicle, and (2) that even if the Ferguson was driving the vehicle, Edwards was guilty of contributory negligence and\r\n  recklessness.Â  Id. at 282, 175 S.E.2d at 225.\r\n[2] Neither New Prime nor Deaton has requested this court\r\n  adopt a rule requiring service on an insurance company under these\r\n  circumstances; therefore, it is not within our province as an appellate court\r\n  to do so. See Langley v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 181, 325 S.E.2d\r\n  550, 561 (Ct. App. 1984) revâ€™d on other grounds, 286 S.C. 85, 332 S.E.2d\r\n  100 (1985) (â€œ[A]ppellate courts in this state, like well-behaved children, do\r\n  not speak unless spoken to and do not answer questions they are not asked.â€).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4459","title":"Timmons v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion\r\n  No. 4459\r\nSubmitted\r\n  October 1, 2008 â€“ Filed November 20, 2008\r\nREVERSED\r\n  and REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tGeorge C.

Warner, Matthew E.\r\n  Steinmetz, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.:Â  This action\r\n  involves several tort and contract claims arising from the alleged conversion\r\n  of account funds by Jane Starkey (Starkey), a securities broker employed with Appellant\r\n  UBS Financial Services, Inc. (UBS).Â  Starkey is also the daughter of Respondent\r\n  Elizabeth Timmons (Timmons), who filed this action against Starkey and UBS.Â  \r\nUBS appeals the circuit courtâ€™s denial\r\n  of its motion to compel arbitration.[1]Â \r\n  UBS challenges the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that arbitration is inappropriate because\r\n  Timmonsâ€™ claims are independent of the partiesâ€™\r\n  contract.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn June 1995, Timmons executed a durable\r\n  power of attorney naming her daughter, Starkey, as her attorney-in-fact.Â  This\r\n  instrument was not recorded with the Greenville County Register of Deeds until June 3, 2004.[2]Â \r\n  Article III of the Power of Attorney includes the following language:Â  \r\n\r\n\tNo person who may act in reliance upon\r\n  the representations of Attorney for the scope of authority granted to Attorney\r\n  shall incur any liability to me or to my estate as a result of permitting\r\n  Attorney to exercise any power, nor shall any person dealing with Attorney\r\n    be responsible to determine or insure the proper application of funds or\r\n    property.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  April 1996, Timmons entered into a contract with J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. (J.C.\r\n  Bradford) for investment services.Â  The contract form included a broadly-worded\r\n  arbitration clause:\r\n\r\n\tI agree . . . that all controversies\r\n  which may arise between us concerning any transaction or the\r\n  construction,Â  performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us\r\n  . . . shall be determined by arbitration.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nAs UBS became the successor-in-interest\r\n  to J.C. Bradford, Timmonsâ€™ account with J.C. Bradford was converted to an account\r\n  with UBS.Â  In November 2004, Timmons executed an investment services contract\r\n  with UBS.Â  That contract also contained a broadly-worded arbitration clause.Â \r\n  The UBS contract states, in part, \r\n\r\n\tBY SIGNING BELOW, I UNDERSTAND,\r\n  ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE . . . that in accordance with the last paragraph of the\r\n  Master Account Agreement entitled â€˜Arbitration[,]â€™ I am agreeing in advance to\r\n  arbitrate any controversies which may arise with . . . UBS Financial Services\r\n  in accordance with the terms outlined therein[.]Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  in original).Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  arbitration clause of the Master Account Agreement states, in part, \r\n\t\r\n\t\tClient agrees . . . that any and all\r\n  controversies which may arise between UBS Financial Services, any of UBS\r\n  Financial Servicesâ€™ employees or agents and Client concerning any account,\r\n    transaction, dispute or the construction, performance or breach of this\r\n  Agreement or any other agreement . . . shall be determined by arbitration.Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).[3]Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to the allegations of Timmonsâ€™ complaint, Starkey removed over $129,000 from\r\n  Timmonsâ€™ accounts at UBS and Branch Banking &amp; Trust and used those funds\r\n  for Starkeyâ€™s personal benefit.Â  Timmons then filed an action against Starkey\r\n  and UBS, seeking damages for Starkeyâ€™s alleged conversion of funds from Timmonsâ€™\r\n  accounts.Â  Timmons asserted causes of action against Starkey and UBS for breach\r\n  of fiduciary duty, negligence, conversion, influenced transactions, intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress, and violation of the Omnibus Adult Protection\r\n  Act.[4]Â \r\n  Timmonsâ€™ complaint also included the following causes of action against Starkey\r\n  alone:Â  breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act,\r\n  and constructive trust. Â \r\nBoth\r\n  UBS and Starkey filed separate motions to compel arbitration of Timmonsâ€™\r\n  claims.Â  The circuit court concluded that the allegations of the complaint fell\r\n  outside the scope of the arbitration clause in the investment services contract\r\n  and that the claims asserted by Timmons were completely independent of the\r\n  contract.Â  Therefore, the circuit court denied both motions to compel\r\n  arbitration.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether a claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de\r\n  novo review. Â Chassereau\r\n    v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 171, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 718, 720&nbsp;(2007). Â However, a circuit courtâ€™s factual\r\n  findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence reasonably supports those\r\n  findings. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUBS argues that the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying its motion to compel arbitration because Timmonsâ€™\r\n  claims against UBS fell within the scope of the arbitration clause in the\r\n  partiesâ€™ contract.Â  In the alternative, UBS argues that there was a significant\r\n  relationship between Timmonsâ€™ claims and the partiesâ€™ contract and that,\r\n  therefore, arbitration was required.Â  We agree. \r\nBoth\r\n  South Carolina and federal policy favor the arbitration of legal disputes. Â Zabinski\r\n    v. Bright Acres Assoc(s)., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001). Â Arbitration\r\n  is required when (1) an arbitration clause specifically encompasses the\r\n  asserted claims; or (2) there exists a significant relationship between the\r\n  asserted claims and the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  Id. at 596-598, 553 S.E.2d\r\n  at 118-119 (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Scope of\r\n  Arbitration Clause\r\nTo decide whether an\r\n  arbitration agreement encompasses a dispute, a court must determine whether the\r\n  factual allegations underlying the claim are within the scope of the broad\r\n  arbitration clause, regardless of the label assigned to the claim.Â  Id. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues\r\n  should be resolved in favor of arbitration.Â  Id.Â  Unless the court can\r\n  say with â€œpositive assuranceâ€ that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to\r\n  an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered.Â  Id.\r\nUBS asserts that all of Timmonsâ€™ claims are based on the\r\n  underlying allegation that UBS failed to prevent Starkey from removing funds\r\n  from Timmonsâ€™ account and that such an allegation is within the scope of the\r\n  arbitration clause.Â  UBS argues that Starkeyâ€™s removal of the funds was a â€œtransactionâ€\r\n  contemplated by the arbitration clause in both the J.C. Bradford contract and\r\n  the UBS contract.Â  We agree.\r\nThe respective arbitration clauses in the J.C. Bradford and UBS contracts\r\n  provide that all controversies which may arise between UBS and Timmons\r\n  concerning any transaction or the performance or breach of any contract between\r\n  the parties shall be determined by arbitration.Â  Additionally, the arbitration\r\n  clause in the UBS agreement expands the scope of arbitrable controversies to\r\n  include those concerning any account or dispute.Â  Â Â \r\nUnquestionably, Starkeyâ€™s removal of funds from Timmonsâ€™ account\r\n  constituted a â€œtransactionâ€ within the scope of the respective arbitration\r\n  clauses in the J.C. Bradford contract and the UBS contract.Â  Further, Starkeyâ€™s\r\n  removal of funds concerned an â€œaccountâ€ within the scope of the arbitration\r\n  clause in the UBS contract.Â  Moreover, all of Timmonsâ€™ claims depend on the\r\n  allegation that UBS failed to prevent Starkey from removing funds from Timmonsâ€™\r\n  account.[5]Â  Any duty that UBS owed toward Timmons arose solely from their\r\n  contractual relationship.Â  Therefore, the respective arbitration clauses in the\r\n  J.C. Bradford contract and the UBS contract encompass Timmonsâ€™ claims.Â  \r\nB.Â  Significant Relationship\r\nUBS alternatively argues that a\r\n  significant relationship exists between Timmonsâ€™ claims and the partiesâ€™\r\n  contract because the underlying allegations involve alleged duties created\r\n  solely by the partiesâ€™ contractual relationship.Â  We agree.\r\nEven if a dispute does not arise\r\n  under the partiesâ€™ contract, a broadly-worded arbitration clause in the\r\n  contract applies to that dispute when a â€œsignificant\r\n  relationshipâ€ exists between the asserted claims and the contract.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119.Â  An instructive discussion of the â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ test is set\r\n  forth in Aiken v. World Fin. Corp. of S.C., 373 S.C. 144, 151, 644 S.E.2d 705, 709&nbsp;(2007).Â  In Aiken,\r\n  a borrowerâ€™s claims against a lender were based on an allegation that the\r\n  lenderâ€™s employees conspired to use the borrowerâ€™s personal information to\r\n  obtain sham loans and to embezzle the proceeds.Â  Aiken, 373 S.C. at 147,\r\n  644 S.E.2d at 707.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court declined to find a significant\r\n  relationship between the borrowerâ€™s claims and his loan contract with the\r\n  lender.Â  Id. at 151, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  at 709.Â  The Court stated that it would refuse to interpret any\r\n  arbitration agreement as applying to outrageous torts that are unforeseeable to\r\n  a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Court also emphasized that a determination of foreseeability is\r\n  to be made from the standpoint of the injured party, i.e., the expectations of\r\n  a reasonable man, rather than from the standpoint of the reviewing court.Â  Id. at 151 n. 6, 644 S.E.2d at 709 n.6. Â The Court made it clear that it did not\r\n  seek to exclude all intentional torts from the group of claims subject to\r\n  arbitration, but that it sought only to distinguish those outrageous torts that\r\n  are legally distinct from the contractual relationship between the parties. Â Aiken,\r\n  373 S.C. at 152, 644 S.E.2d at 709.Â Â Â Â Â  &nbsp;\r\nHere, Timmonsâ€™ claims depend\r\n  on the underlying assertion that UBS failed to prevent Starkey from removing\r\n  Timmonsâ€™ funds from her account.Â  Any duty to prevent the removal of funds from\r\n  Timmonsâ€™ account arises solely from the partiesâ€™ contractual relationship.Â \r\n  Further, we agree with UBS's argument that the exception for outrageous and\r\n  unforeseeable conduct does not apply to Timmonsâ€™ claims, so as to preclude\r\n  arbitration of those claims. Â In light of Timmonsâ€™ execution of the power of\r\n  attorney, it was foreseeable that UBS could determine that Starkey had the\r\n  authority to withdraw funds from Timmonsâ€™ account.Â  \r\nStarkeyâ€™s alleged misappropriation\r\n  of the funds after she withdrew them from Timmonsâ€™ account may have been\r\n  unforeseeable and certainly outrageous.Â  However, the relevant inquiry does not\r\n  focus on the foreseeability of Starkeyâ€™s betrayal of Timmonsâ€™ trust, but rather\r\n  on the foreseeability of UBS's inaction prior to and during Starkeyâ€™s\r\n  withdrawal of the funds from the UBS account.\r\nFurther, foreseeability\r\n  must be examined from the standpoint of the injured party, i.e., the\r\n  expectations of a reasonable person in Timmonsâ€™ position at the time she entered\r\n  into the contract with UBS.Â  See Aiken, 373 S.C. at 151 n. 6, 644 S.E.2d at 709 n. 6.Â  In\r\n  applying the reasonable person standard to the facts of Timmonsâ€™ case, it is\r\n  impossible to ignore her execution of the power of attorney.Â  That instrument\r\n  gave Starkey clear legal authority to withdraw funds from Timmonsâ€™ accounts and\r\n  expressly held harmless anyone who might rely on the power of attorney while\r\n  doing business with Starkey.Â  By the time Timmons signed the investment\r\n  services contract with UBS in November 2004, the power of attorney had been\r\n  recorded.[6]Â \r\n  Therefore, it was foreseeable to a reasonable person in the context of normal\r\n  business dealings that UBS would allow Starkey to withdraw funds from Timmonsâ€™ account.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nArbitration is required when\r\n  either (1) an arbitration clause specifically encompasses the asserted claims;\r\n  or (2) there exists a significant relationship between the asserted claims and\r\n  the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  The respective arbitration clauses in the J.C. Bradford\r\n  contract and the UBS contract specifically encompass Timmonsâ€™ claims against\r\n  UBS because they all concern a transaction involving her UBS account.Â  \r\nFurther, there is a\r\n  significant relationship between the partiesâ€™ contract and Timmonsâ€™ claims. Â Those\r\n  claims depend on the allegation that UBS breached a duty to prevent Starkey from\r\n  transferring Timmonsâ€™ funds from her UBS account.Â  That alleged duty was\r\n  created solely by the contractual relationship between the parties.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the exception for outrageous and unforeseeable conduct that would preclude\r\n  arbitration does not apply to UBS because the possibility\r\n  that UBS could rely on the power of attorney was foreseeable to Timmons when\r\n  she signed the J.C. Bradford and UBS contracts.Â  Based on the foregoing, the circuit\r\n  court must compel arbitration of Timmonsâ€™ claims against UBS.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  is\r\nREVERSED\r\n  and REMANDED.[7]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Starkey has not\r\n  appealed the circuit courtâ€™s denial of her motion to compel arbitration.\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 62-5-501(C) (Supp. 2007) requires a durable power of attorney to be recorded\r\n  to be effective, unless the authority of the\r\n  attorney-in-fact relates solely to the person of the principal.Â Â Â  Â \r\n[3]Timmons argues\r\n  that UBS'S Master Account Agreement should not have been included in the Record\r\n  on Appeal because UBS failed to present it to the circuit court.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  While the Master Account Agreement was not included with UBS'S pleadings, it\r\n  was incorporated into the UBS contract by direct reference, and the UBS\r\n  contract was included in UBS'S Motion to Compel Arbitration.Â  In any event, the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order sets forth the pertinent language of the arbitration\r\n  clause in the J.C. Bradford contract and includes a finding that Timmons signed\r\n  a similar contract with UBS.Â  Timmons did not appeal this finding, and as such,\r\n  it is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller\r\n    Hous. Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871-72 (2000) (holding that\r\n  an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  \r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§Â§ 43-35-5 to -595 (Supp. 2007).\r\n[5]None of Timmonsâ€™\r\n  claims include any allegations of improper management of her account, such as\r\n  churning or making improper investments, prior to Starkeyâ€™s removal of funds\r\n  from the account.Â  \r\n[6] Even when Timmons signed the\r\n  J.C. Bradford contract, she should have been aware that the hold-harmless\r\n  language in the existing power of attorney, once recorded, could induce those\r\n  doing business with Starkey to honor her full control over the account funds.\r\n[7] Pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR, we decide this appeal without oral arguments.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4460","title":"Pocisk v.

Lyles, Jr., of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tDrew A. Laughlin, of Hilton Head Island, and Edwin Russell Jeter,\r\n  Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Johnny Payne,\r\n  d/b/a Sea Coast Construction, (Payne) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting\r\n  relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, to George B. Pocisk and Ann\r\n  M. Pocisk.Â  We find the order is not immediately appealable and dismiss the\r\n  appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Pocisks brought\r\n  an action against Payne and others alleging their house had been defectively\r\n  constructed.Â  Although Payneâ€™s insurer, St. Paul Travelers, denied coverage for\r\n  the claim, it provided Payne with a defense, pursuant to a full reservation of\r\n  rights.Â  After the other defendants settled with the Pocisks, Payne and the\r\n  Pocisks entered into a settlement agreement in which Payne confessed judgment\r\n  in the amount of $250,000 and the Pocisks agreed not to seek satisfaction of\r\n  the judgment from Payne.Â  Payne assigned to the Pocisks his rights in any claim\r\n  involving insurance coverage and bad faith issues arising out the St. Paul\r\n  Travelers insurance policy.Â  A judgment was entered against Payne in the\r\n  Beaufort County Court of Common Pleas in the amount of $250,000.Â  The judgment\r\n  does not mention the condition that the Pocisks would not seek satisfaction\r\n  against Payne.Â  \r\nAfter the parties\r\n  entered into the settlement agreement, St. Paul Travelers brought a declaratory\r\n  judgment action in the United States District Court seeking a declaration that\r\n  it was not obligated to defend or indemnify Payne for the Pocisksâ€™ claim.Â  The\r\n  district court allowed the Pocisks to intervene.Â  Their attorney also\r\n  represented Payne in the declaratory judgment action.Â  Relying on opinions from\r\n  the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals,[1] the district court held the settlement agreement was presumptively unreasonable\r\n  and therefore invalid. St. Paul Travelers v. Payne, 444 F. Supp.\r\n  519, 522 (D.S.C. 2006).Â  The court concluded that because the settlement\r\n  agreement was invalid, St. Paul Travelers was not obligated to indemnify Payne\r\n  for the $250,000 confession of judgment.Â  Id.Â  In its order on the\r\n  Pocisks and Payneâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the court clarified that if the\r\n  judgment entered on the underlying suit was vacated, it would then have\r\n  jurisdiction to consider the issue of whether St. Paul Travelersâ€™ denial of the\r\n  claim was appropriate. \r\nThe Pocisks then\r\n  filed a motion in the Beaufort County Court of Common Pleas to vacate the\r\n  $250,000 consent judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, and restore the action\r\n  to the trial roster.Â  The court initially denied the Pocisks the relief\r\n  requested.Â  The Pocisks filed a motion to alter or amend asserting the courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling violated the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.Â \r\n  Payne did not file a return to this motion.Â  The trial court granted the motion\r\n  to alter or amend, finding the district court decision was binding on all\r\n  parties to this action.Â  It vacated the consent judgment and restored the case\r\n  to the trial docket.Â  Payne filed a motion to reconsider, which the trial court\r\n  denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYIS\r\nThe\r\n  Pocisks assert the order granting Rule 60(b) relief is not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether a party may immediately appeal an order issued before\r\n  or during trial is governed primarily by statute. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330\r\n  (1976 &amp; Supp. 2007); Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 195, 607\r\n  S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005).Â Â  â€œAn order generally must fall into one of several\r\n  categories set forth in that statute in order to be immediately appealable.â€Â  Hagood,\r\n  362 S.C. at 195, 607 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Payne asserts the order is immediately\r\n  appealable under section 14-3-330(2), which provides for the immediate appeal\r\n  of an interlocutory order \r\n\r\n\taffecting\r\n  a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines\r\n  the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or\r\n  discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out\r\n  an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action. \r\n\r\nPayne\r\n  could seek review of the order granting Rule 60(b) relief following final\r\n  judgment in the case.Â  See Peterkin v. Brigman, 319 S.C. 367,\r\n  368, 461 S.E.2d 809, 810 (1995) (holding an order refusing to enforce a\r\n  settlement agreement is not immediately appealable because it does not prevent\r\n  a judgment from being rendered in the action, and appellant can seek review of\r\n  the current order in any appeal from final judgment).Â  In addition, the order\r\n  does not strike out any part of a pleading in the action.Â  Therefore, neither\r\n  subsections (a) nor (c) apply to this order.Â  \r\nPayne\r\n  asserts the order has the effect of granting a new trial and thus falls under\r\n  section 14-3-330(2)(b).Â  However, in holding an order granting Rule 60(b)\r\n  relief to set aside a default judgment is not immediately appealable, this\r\n  court explained such orders â€œare neither final orders nor orders granting a new\r\n  trial, the reasoning being that they are interlocutory in nature and since\r\n  there has never been a trial in the first instance they cannot be considered\r\n  orders granting a â€˜newâ€™ trial or â€˜rehearing.â€™â€Â Â  Pioneer Assocs. v. Ticor\r\n    Title Ins. Co., 300 S.C. 346, 348, 387 S.E.2d 711, 712 (Ct. App. 1989).Â \r\n  The order here, as with the order in Pioneer Associates, does not grant\r\n  a â€œnewâ€ trial because there has not been a trial yet in the case.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, the order granting Rule 60(b) relief does not affect a substantial\r\n  right.Â  Our supreme court has recognized:Â  â€œAvoidance of trial is not a\r\n  â€˜substantial rightâ€™ entitling a party to immediate appeal of an interlocutory\r\n  order.â€Â  Shields v. Martin Marietta Corp., 303 S.C. 469, 470, 402 S.E.2d\r\n  482, 483 (1991) (holding decision on a motion to restore the case to the active\r\n  docket is not immediately appealable).Â  Similarly, in holding the grant of Rule\r\n  60(b) relief was not immediately appealable, the North Carolina Court of\r\n  Appeals explained:Â  â€œThe right to avoid one trial on the disputed issues is not\r\n  normally a substantial right that would allow an interlocutory appeal.â€ Â Metcalf\r\n    v. Palmer, 265 S.E.2d 484, 485 (N.C. Ct. App. 1980).Â  In applying their\r\n  statute similar to our section 14-3-330(b),[2] the North Carolina courts have consistently held an order granting Rule 60(b)\r\n  relief is not immediately appealable.Â  See Waters v. Qualified\r\n    Personnel, Inc., 240 S.E.2d 338 (N.C. 1978) (holding order setting aside\r\n  summary judgment for procedural irregularity was not immediately appealable); Bailey\r\n    v. Gooding, 270 S.E.2d 431 (N.C. 1980) (holding an order allowing a motion\r\n  under Rule 60(b) is not immediately appealable because it is interlocutory and\r\n  does not affect a substantial right); Anglin Stone v. Curtis, 553 S.E.2d\r\n  244 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001) (holding order granting Rule 60(b) relief from\r\n  dismissal due to defects with service of process is not immediately\r\n  appealable).\r\nWe\r\n  find the order granting the Pocisksâ€™ motion for relief from judgment neither\r\n  affects a substantial right nor grants a new trial.Â  As the order does not meet\r\n  the requirements of section 14-3-330(2) and does not fall within any of the\r\n  other categories set forth in section 14-3-330, the order is not immediately\r\n  appealable.[3]Â  \r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stonehenge Engâ€™g Corp. v.

Cox, 737 F.2d 421 (4th Cir. 1984) (Virginia case). \r\n[2]Â  The North Carolina statute allows for immediate\r\n  appeal from an interlocutory order that: \r\n\r\n\t(1) Affects a substantial right, or\r\n\t(2) In\r\n  effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which appeal might be\r\n  taken, or\r\n\t(3) Discontinues the action, or\r\n\t(4) Grants or refuses a new trial . . . .\r\n\r\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. Â§ 7A-27\r\n  (Lexis-Nexis 2005).Â  \r\n[3] Although appellate courts have considered appeals\r\n  from the granting of Rule 60(b) relief, the issue of appealability was not\r\n  addressed.Â  See e.g. Johnson v. Johnson, 310 S.C. 44, 425 S.E.2d\r\n  46 (Ct. App. 1992); Mitchell Supply Co., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 375\r\n  S.E.2d 321 (Ct.

Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-60.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThe\r\n  Original Blue Ribbon Taxi Cab Corporation (â€œBlue Ribbonâ€) operates a fleet of\r\n  taxi cabs in South Carolina and has been in operation for over seventy years.Â \r\n  Blue Ribbon originally insured its vehicles with policies from various\r\n  insurance carriers.Â  However, due to soaring policy rates, Blue Ribbon sought\r\n  and obtained a Self-Insurance Certificate from the DMV.Â  In order to meet the\r\n  requirements of a self-insurer, Blue Ribbon maintained a segregated claims\r\n  account to pay judgments entered against it, relying on a letter of credit from\r\n  the Sumter National Bank (â€œBankâ€). Â The DMV accepted the letter of credit as\r\n  complying with the statutory prerequisites.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 14, 2005, Blue Ribbon and the Bank renewed and amended the irrevocable\r\n  letter of credit to limit claims to the minimum automobile insurance policy\r\n  limits enacted by the General Assembly.Â  In February 2006, the DMV denied Blue\r\n  Ribbonâ€™s renewal application for the Self-Insurance Certificate in response to\r\n  the new limitations provided for in the letter of credit.Â  Blue Ribbon\r\n  contested the decision before a DMV Senior Hearing Officer. Â In his order\r\n  affirming the denial, the Senior Hearing Officer expounded: \r\n\r\n\tI conclude that the DMV was not\r\n  satisfied that the Letter of Credit submitted by the Petitioner showed ability\r\n  to satisfy any judgment against it.Â  I conclude that this decision was in the\r\n  discretion of DMV as afforded by Section 56-9-60, that the decision was not\r\n  unreasonable and that it did not contradict state law.Â  \r\n\r\nBlue Ribbon further appealed to the Administrative Law Court.Â Â  The ALC judge issued an order enunciating: \r\n\r\n\tI conclude that the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  decision to deny Blue Ribbonâ€™s application warrants reversal.Â  The Departmentâ€™s\r\n  decision is premised on the assumption that the legislature intended for\r\n  self-insurers to provide greater protection to the public than statutory\r\n  liability policies provide.Â  However, the Departmentâ€™s assumption is at odds\r\n  with the way in which our Supreme Court has interpreted legislative intent with\r\n  respect to the self-insurer statute.Â  \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tFurthermore, if the Department were able\r\n  to deny self-insurer status in any case where it was dissatisfied that the\r\n  applicant was able to pay any judgment that might be entered against it,\r\n  then the Department could deny virtually all applications for self-insurer\r\n  certification.Â  Few, if any, South Carolina companies seeking self-insurer\r\n  certification can show that they are able to satisfy any potential\r\n  adverse judgment, no matter how large.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  in original).Â  The ALC judge concluded Blue Ribbon had complied with the\r\n  statutory requirements for self-insurer status and reversed the decision of the\r\n  DMV.Â Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the Administrative Law Court err in reversing the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Motor Vehiclesâ€™ denial of Blue Ribbonâ€™s application for a Self-Insurance\r\n  Certificate under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-60?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  an appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act provides the appropriate standard of review.Â  Olson v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 379 S.C. 57, 63, 663 S.E.2d 497, 500-501\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008); Turner v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.

App. 2005).Â  Section\r\n  1-23-610(C) of the South Carolina Code is applicable and efficacious in\r\n  articulating the standard:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe review of the administrative law\r\n  judgeâ€™s order must be confined to the record.Â  The reviewing tribunal may\r\n  affirm the decision or remand the case for further proceedings; or it may reverse\r\n  or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner has been\r\n  prejudiced because of the finding, conclusion, or decision is:Â  \r\n\t(a) in violation of constitutional or\r\n  statutory provisions; \r\n\t(b) in excess of the statutory authority\r\n  of the agency; \r\n\t(c) made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d) affected by other error of law; \r\n\t(e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n\t(f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n  discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  decision of the Administrative Law Court should not be overturned unless it is\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by some error of law.Â  Olson,\r\n  379 S.C. at 63, 663 S.E.2d at 501 (â€œ[T]his court can reverse the ALC if the\r\n  findings are affected by error of law, are not supported by substantial\r\n  evidence, or are characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n  exercise of discretion.â€); see S.C.

Â§ 56-9-60(A) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  central issue in the case at bar is whether Blue Ribbon met the statutory\r\n  requirements to receive self-insurance status as required by the applicable\r\n  law.Â  The DMV does not contest Blue Ribbon complied with the requirements of\r\n  the statute except for a single provision.Â  The dispute centers on whether the\r\n  limitations placed on Blue Ribbonâ€™s letter of credit constitute a failure to\r\n  comply with Section 56-9-60(A)(4).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  principles of statutory construction offer guidance in interpreting the relevant\r\n  legislation in this case.Â  The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to\r\n  ascertain and effectuate the legislatureâ€™s intent.Â  In re Campbell, 379\r\n  S.C. 593, Â Â Â Â Â , 666 S.E.2d 908, 911 (2008); Howell v.

Burdetteâ€™s\r\n    Leasing Serv., Inc., 268 S.C. 472, 477, 234 S.E.2d 870, 872 (1977), our\r\n  Supreme Court asseverated:\r\n\r\n\tThe overall purpose of the\r\n  [self-insurance statute] is to assure protection for the public for injuries\r\n  and damages growing out of the negligent operation of motor vehicles on the\r\n  roads of this State.Â  \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tWe think it was the intention of the\r\n  legislature that a self-insurer provide the same protection to the public that\r\n  a statutory liability policy provides.Â  A self-insurer substitutes for an\r\n  insurance policy to the extent of the statutory policy requirements.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nIn Wright v. North Area Taxi, Inc., 337 S.C. 419, 423, 523 S.E.2d 472, 474\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999), this Court instructed:\r\n\r\n\tUnder South Carolina law, however, a\r\n  company that has more than twenty-five motor vehicles registered in its name\r\n  may be a self-insurer upon satisfying the statutory requirements.Â  As a\r\n  self-insurer, North Area Taxi, was required to provide the same minimum\r\n  protections to the public as the minimum limits required by a statutory\r\n  liability policy.Â  Technically, a self-insurer is not an insurer at all;\r\n  rather, a self-insurer provides a substitute for an insurance policy.\r\n\r\n(citations\r\n  omitted).Â  In other decisions, South Carolina courts have required\r\n  self-insurers to extend coverage to the extent provided for by statutory\r\n  liability policies in respect to Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM).Â  See Wright\r\n    v. Smallwood, 308 S.C. 471, 419 S.E.2d 219 (1992) (requiring self-insured city\r\n  to provide UM coverage to employee injured while driving city vehicle); S.C.\r\n    Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Jeter, 288 S.C. 432, 343 S.E.2d 47 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding self-insured bus operator responsible for UM coverage of passenger\r\n  injured in accident).Â  \r\nJuxtaposing\r\n  the case law precedent and the plain language of Section 56-9-60, we find Blue\r\n  Ribbon properly complied with the requirements for self-insurance status and\r\n  affirm the decision of the ALC.Â  Our courts have consistently held\r\n  self-insurers are required to provide a substitute for an insurance policy to\r\n  the extent of the statutory policy requirements.Â  See Southern Home\r\n    Ins., 268 S.C. at 477, 234 S.E.2d at 872. Â Blue Ribbon complied with the\r\n  requirements established by Section 56-9-60(A) and provided a segregated claims\r\n  account in the form of a letter of credit containing the per vehicle sum mandated\r\n  by the statute.Â  The limiting language added to the letter of credit merely\r\n  serves to ensure Blue Ribbonâ€™s substitute for a policy conforms to the\r\n  statutory policy requirements ensconced in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp.\r\n  2007) (Currently, minimum statutory policy limits are set at twenty-five\r\n  thousand dollars for bodily injury to a single person in a single accident,\r\n  fifty thousand dollars for bodily injury to two or more people in a single\r\n  accident, and twenty-five thousand dollars for property damage resulting from a\r\n  single accident.Â  This statute has been amended subsequent to the drafting of\r\n  the letter of credit addressed in this case).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  plain language of Section 56-9-60(A) requires the applicant to prove to the\r\n  department that â€œthe person or company is able to pay any judgments obtained . . . .â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  However, the determination of what constitutes\r\n  the ability to pay any judgment is derived from the statute as a whole and the\r\n  relevant case law.Â  Our courts have concluded the legislature intended for\r\n  self-insurers to conform to the statutory policy requirements.Â  A literal\r\n  reading of the â€œany judgments obtainedâ€ clause would be inconsistent with case\r\n  law precedent and would lead to an absurd result clearly unintended by the\r\n  legislature.Â  This interpretation would allow the DMV exceedingly broad discretion\r\n  to deny applicants who were unable to satisfy hypothetical judgments far\r\n  greater than the statutory policy requirements necessary for other insured\r\n  motorists.Â  Therefore, Section 56-9-60 must be interpreted in conjunction with\r\n  the minimum statutory policy requirements of Section 38-77-140.Â  We find this\r\n  to be the correct figure to look to when determining whether an applicant has\r\n  the capacity to satisfy any adverse judgments.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  56-9-60 establishes four prongs to be followed by the DMV in determining the\r\n  financial responsibility of the company.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-9-60(A)(1)-(4).Â  Blue Ribbon complied with all of these necessary\r\n  qualifications.Â  The limiting language in the letter of credit conformed with\r\n  the statutory policy requirements mandated by Section 38-77-140.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Blue Ribbonâ€™s letter of credit satisfied all statutory prerequisites and the\r\n  application for the Self-Insurance Certificate should have been granted.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the order of the Honorable John D.

Â Â Prior to the purchase, Carolina\r\n  Chloride's realtor contacted the Richland County Planning and Zoning Department\r\n  (&quot;County&quot;) to inquire about the zoning of the IBM property. Â Â Carolina\r\n  Chloride required M-2 zoning for heavy industry because it planned to use the\r\n  property for storing and distributing calcium chloride, a nonhazardous chemical\r\n  used for ice or dust control on roads and for treating drinking water.Â  In\r\n  response to the inquiry, County allegedly informed the realtor of the property's\r\n  M-2 zoning designation.[2]\r\nThe month after purchase of the property, Carolina Chloride's president,\r\n  Robert Morgan (&quot;Morgan&quot;), went to County seeking a building permit.Â \r\n  The zoning administrator, Terry Brown, told Morgan he believed the County zoned\r\n  the property M-2, but there was a question about the tax map. Â The following\r\n  day, the zoning administrator wrote Morgan a letter confirming County zoned the\r\n  property M-2. \r\nOver the ensuing six years, Carolina Chloride invested more than four\r\n  hundred thousand dollars to improve the property, including building a\r\n  mini-warehouse business. Â In order to build and maintain the businesses on the\r\n  property, Carolina Chloride sought multiple licenses, certificates, and permits\r\n  from County. Â Either the zoning administrator or other authorized County\r\n  employees approved all such requests with each reflecting M-2 zoning. Â \r\nIn 2002, Morgan began negotiating the sale of the business with Allen,\r\n  Johnette and Luke Watson (&quot;the Watsons&quot;). Â In pursuit of Carolina\r\n  Chloride's purchase, the Watsons entered discussions with a bank to obtain\r\n  financing, reviewed Carolina Chloride's financial records, and created a\r\n  business plan for their intended expansion of the company.Â  After continued\r\n  discussions, Morgan agreed to sell Carolina Chloride and all its assets for 1.1\r\n  million dollars; however, Morgan and the Watsons never reduced the agreement to\r\n  writing. Â \r\nThereafter, Carolina Chloride and the Watsons contacted John W. Hicks (&quot;Hicks&quot;),\r\n  County's employee authorized to inform citizens whether their intended property\r\n  use conformed to applicable zoning ordinances.Â  Carolina Chloride sought County's\r\n  approval for the Watsons' planned expansion of Carolina Chloride's property. Â On\r\n  February 13, 2003, Hicks advised Carolina Chloride the property was zoned rural\r\n  (RU). Â Hicks further advised that the current use of the property did not\r\n  conform to the zoning ordinances; therefore, County would not permit any future\r\n  expansion of the property. Â Hicks did state Carolina Chloride could continue\r\n  its non-conforming use and could petition the Planning Commission to amend the\r\n  zoning map to reflect M-2 zoning.Â  As a result, the Watsons decided they did\r\n  not want to purchase Carolina Chloride alleging RU zoning &quot;totally killed\r\n  the sale.&quot; \r\nIn August of 2003, Carolina Chloride petitioned to change the property's\r\n  zoning from RU to M-2. Â On November 4, 2003, Richland County Council approved\r\n  the request and amended the zoning map.Â  Carolina Chloride subsequently filed\r\n  suit against County alleging multiple causes of action associated with the\r\n  unsuccessful sale of Carolina Chloride's property.\r\nAt trial, County denied all claims and asserted defenses under the South\r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act. Â During trial, the court refused to allow Carolina\r\n  Chloride to read sections of Terry Brown's deposition to the jury because Terry\r\n  Brown was no longer the zoning administrator. Â At the end of Carolina Chloride's\r\n  case-in-chief, the trial court granted County's motion for directed verdict on\r\n  all causes of action. Â Carolina Chloride filed a motion to reconsider, which\r\n  the trial court denied.Â  Carolina Chloride now appeals.[3] Â Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in excluding the testimony \r\n\t\t\tof the former zoning administrator?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in finding there was no \r\n\t\t\tright to rely regarding the constructive fraud claim?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err as a matter of law in \r\n\t\t\tfinding Richland County did not owe a duty to Carolina Chloride?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err as a matter of law in \r\n\t\t\tfinding the Tort Claims Act provided Richland County with immunity?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in finding no evidence of \r\n\t\t\tgross negligence by Richland County?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in ruling as a matter of \r\n\t\t\tlaw there was no governmental taking by Richland County?&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in ruling as a matter of \r\n\t\t\tlaw there was no deprivation of substantive due process by Richland \r\n\t\t\tCounty?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVIII.\r\n\t\t\tDid Carolina\r\n  Chloride waive its governmental estoppel and promissory estoppel arguments?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for directed verdict, appellate courts apply the\r\n  same standard as the trial court viewing evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Gadson ex rel.

Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of South Carolina, 323 S.C.\r\n  367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 442 (1996).Â  The exclusion of evidence will not be\r\n  reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court prohibited Carolina Chloride from reading excerpts of the\r\n  deposition of Terry Brown (the former zoning administrator) at trial based on\r\n  Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  The rule provides, &quot;[t]he deposition of a party or\r\n  of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or\r\n  managing agent . . . may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP. \r\nCarolina Chloride argues Brown qualified as an\r\n  officer, director, or managing agent under Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP. Â While Brown\r\n  was no longer the zoning administrator for County when deposed, Carolina\r\n  Chloride asserts he met the requirements of Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP, as a current member\r\n  of the Zoning Board of Adjustment.Â  Carolina Chloride, however, has not\r\n  demonstrated the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Brown's\r\n  deposition testimony.Â  Furthermore, Brown's current status as a member of the\r\n  Zoning Board of Adjustment, in and of itself, does not require admission of the\r\n  deposition under Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  Carolina Chloride did not lay any\r\n  foundation as to why Brown's role on the Board qualifies under Rule 32(a)(2).Â  If\r\n  not admissible under Rule 32(a)(2), Carolina Chloride needed to demonstrate Brown\r\n  was unavailable pursuant to Rule 32(a)(3), SCRCP, or alternatively, if Brown\r\n  was available, Carolina Chloride should have called him as a witness at trial.Â \r\n  Indeed, Carolina Chloride opined at trial that the application of Rule\r\n  32(a)(2), SCRCP, to the admissibility of Brown's deposition was &quot;a weak\r\n  argument.&quot;Â  Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  excluding Brown's deposition at trial in the absence of the requisite\r\n  foundation.[4]\r\nII.&nbsp; Constructive Fraud and Right to Rely\r\nCarolina Chloride argues the trial court erred in\r\n  dismissing the constructive fraud claim because a right to rely exists when\r\n  there is no evidence the government employee is acting outside the scope of his\r\n  authority.Â Â  \r\nTo prove constructive fraud, all elements of actual\r\n  fraud except the element of intent must be established.Â  Armstrong v.\r\n    Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 219, 621 S.E.2d 368, 375 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  To\r\n  sustain a claim for fraud, the following elements must be demonstrated &quot;by\r\n  clear, cogent, and convincing evidence: (1) a representation of fact; (2) its\r\n  falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or a reckless\r\n  disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted\r\n  upon; (6) the hearer's ignorance of the falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance on\r\n  its truth; (8) the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's\r\n  consequent and proximate injury.&quot;Â  Schnellmann v. Roettger, 373\r\n  S.C. 379, 382, 645 S.E.2d 239, 241 (2007).Â  &quot;Actual fraud is distinguished\r\n  from constructive fraud by the presence or absence of the intent to\r\n  deceive.&quot; Armstrong, 366 S.C. at 219, 621 S.E.2d at 375.Â  &quot;However,\r\n  in a constructive fraud case, where there is no confidential or fiduciary\r\n  relationship, and an arm's length transaction between mature, educated people\r\n  is involved, there is no right to rely.&quot;Â  Id. (internal quotations\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nHere, Carolina Chloride has failed to offer evidence\r\n  demonstrating a confidential or fiduciary relationship arose between Carolina\r\n  Chloride and County employees.Â  &quot;A confidential or fiduciary relationship\r\n  exists when one imposes a special confidence in another, so that the latter, in\r\n  equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard\r\n  for the interests of the one imposing the confidence.&quot; Â Hendricks v.\r\n    Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458, 578 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003) (declining to\r\n  find a fiduciary relationship between a student and an academic advisor).Â  Carolina\r\n  Chloride suggests a confidential or fiduciary relationship arose between\r\n  Carolina Chloride and County merely based on the fact the zoning administrator\r\n  had a one-on-one conversation with the owner of Carolina Chloride.Â  See Armstrong 366 S.C. at 219, 621 S.E.2d at 375 (&quot;A relationship must be more than\r\n  casual to equal a fiduciary relationship.&quot;). Â Our courts have not\r\n  recognized a confidential or fiduciary relationship between individuals and\r\n  zoning administrators.Â  Moreover, the imposition of fiduciary relationships generally\r\n  has been reserved to special relationships or &quot;to legal or business\r\n  settings, often in which one person entrusts money to the other, such as with\r\n  lawyers, brokers, corporate directors, and corporate promoters.&quot;Â  Hendricks,\r\n  353 S.C. at 459, 578 S.E.2d at 716.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in\r\n  dismissing Carolina Chlorides' constructive fraud claim as a matter of law.[5]\r\nIII.&nbsp; Public Duty Rule\r\nThe trial court ruled as a matter of law County owed\r\n  Carolina Chloride no &quot;special duty,&quot; warranting a directed verdict on\r\n  Carolina Chloride's negligence claims. Â Carolina Chloride asserts this ruling was\r\n  in error because the public duty rule does not apply to its tort claims. We\r\n  agree. \r\nTo establish liability in a negligence action, the claimant must show:\r\n  (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) breach of that\r\n  duty; and (3) damages resulting from the breach. Bishop v. South Carolina\r\n    Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 88, 502 S.E.2d 78, 82 (1998). Â Statutes,\r\n  contractual relationships, property interests, and other special circumstances\r\n  may give rise to an affirmative legal duty to act. Madison ex rel. Bryant v.\r\n    Babcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 136, 638 S.E.2d 650, 656-57 (2006). Â &quot;When,\r\n  and only when, the plaintiff relies upon a statute as creating the duty does a\r\n  doctrine known as the 'public duty rule' come into play.&quot; Arthurs ex\r\n    rel. Estate of Munn v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97, 103, 551 S.E.2d 579, 582\r\n  (2001). Â \r\nIn Arthurs, our state's supreme court analyzed whether the Tort\r\n  Claims Act and the public duty rule were incompatible. Â Id. at 102, 551\r\n  S.E.2d at 581-82. Â While the court did confirm the viability of the public duty\r\n  rule, the court clarified what types of situations could give rise to the rule.\r\n  Â Id. at 105, 551 S.E.2d at 583. Â Accordingly, only when the plaintiff\r\n  relies upon a statute as creating the duty does the public duty rule come into\r\n  play. Â Id. at 103, 551 S.E.2d at 582.Â  In other words, &quot;where the\r\n  duty relied upon is based upon the common law . . . then the existence of that\r\n  duty is analyzed as it would be were the defendant a private entity.&quot; Â Trousdell\r\n    v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 641, 572 S.E.2d 264, 266-67 (2002) (analyzing the\r\n  implications of the holding in Arthurs) (internal quotations omitted).Â  \r\nHere, Carolina Chloride asserts a negligence claim based upon the common\r\n  law duty to exercise reasonable care. Â Specifically, Carolina Chloride argues\r\n  County breached its duty of reasonable care in maintaining the zoning records.Â \r\n  Carolina Chloride does not base its negligence claims on any statutory duty.Â  Because\r\n  Carolina Chloride relies on a common law duty and not a statutory duty, the\r\n  trial court erred in applying the public duty rule. Â See Trousdell,\r\n  351 S.C. at 641, 572 S.E.2d at 267 (holding the public duty rule did not bar an\r\n  alleged breach of the common law duty to exercise reasonable care). \r\nNevertheless, Carolina Chloride's claims may still be barred under an\r\n  exception to the waiver of immunity enumerated in the South Carolina Tort\r\n  Claims Act. Â See Madison, 371 S.C. 123, 142, 638 S.E.2d 650, 660\r\n  (stating &quot;[w]hen a governmental entity owes a duty of care . . . under the\r\n  common law and other elements of negligence are shown, the next step is to\r\n  analyze the applicability of exceptions to the waiver of immunity . . .\r\n  asserted by the governmental entity.&quot;). Â Accordingly, we now address whether\r\n  the exceptions County raised bar Carolina Chloride's negligence claim. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Sovereign ImmunityÂ Â Â Â  \r\nCarolina Chloride asserts the trial court erred in finding County immune\r\n  from liability under Section 15-78-40 of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. Â \r\nThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act (&quot;the Tort Claims Act&quot; or &quot;the\r\n  Act&quot;) constitutes the exclusive civil remedy for any tort committed by a\r\n  governmental employee while acting within the scope of the employee's official\r\n  duties. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-200 (2005).Â  The Tort Claims Act does not create\r\n  causes of action, but removes the common law bar of governmental immunity. Â Arthurs,\r\n  346 S.C. at 105, 551 S.E.2d at 583.Â  The Act is a limited waiver of sovereign\r\n  immunity. Â Steinke v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing, and\r\n    Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 393, 520 S.E.2d 142, 152 (1999). \r\nThe trial court interpreted Â§ 15-78-40 to require a private sector\r\n  analogy for a governmental entity to be held liable under the Act. Â This\r\n  section provides, &quot;[t]he State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a\r\n  governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the\r\n  same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the\r\n  limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and\r\n  damages, contained herein.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005).\r\nRecently, this court reversed an order of summary judgment where the\r\n  trial court, relying on Â§ 15-78-40, determined the government could only be\r\n  held liable under the Tort Claims Act if a private individual could be held liable\r\n  for similar conduct.Â  Quail Hill, L.L.C. v. County of Richland, 379 S.C.\r\n  314, 665 S.E.2d 194 (Ct. App. 2008) cert. granted, (April 22, 2009).Â  However,\r\n  this decision did not hold our state's Tort Claims Act lacked a private analogy\r\n  mandate; instead, this decision merely emphasized the summary judgment\r\n  procedural posture of the case and the absence of state precedent supporting or\r\n  opposing a private sector analogy requirement. Moreover, Quail Hill expressly\r\n  acknowledged persuasive federal authority supporting the trial court's interpretation\r\n  of Â§ 15-78-40.Â  379 S.C. at 322, 665 S.E.2d at 198.\r\nIn United States v. Olson, 546 U.S. 43 (2005), the United States Supreme\r\n  Court analyzed a provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act similar to Â§ 15-78-40.\r\n  Â Â The federal provision allows tort actions against the United States\r\n  government &quot;under circumstances where the United States, if a private\r\n  person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place\r\n  where the act or omission occurred.&quot;Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1346(b)(1).Â  The Court\r\n  noted the words, &quot;'like circumstances' do not restrict a court's inquiry\r\n  to the same circumstances, but require it to look further afield.&quot; Â Olson,\r\n  546 U.S. at 46 (internal citations omitted).Â  The Court suggested a further\r\n  inquiry to determine whether an analogous situation could exist in which a\r\n  private individual could be found liable for the same conduct. Â Id. at\r\n  47. Â In essence, the Court concluded if a private citizen could be held liable for\r\n  negligently performing a task, then the government could be held liable for\r\n  negligently performing a similar task.\r\nHere, we need not resolve the private analogy question.Â  Carolina\r\n  Chloride argues County negligently maintained its zoning records resulting in\r\n  Carolina Chloride's injury.Â  Even if a private analogy is required, this claim\r\n  is analogous, for example, to allegations of negligence against a private\r\n  hospital or private school for negligently maintaining an individual's records.Â \r\n  An analogy may be present where, as a result of negligently maintaining a\r\n  patient's medical records, a hospital gives a patient his or her wrong blood\r\n  type causing the patient harm.Â  Similarly, an analogous situation may exist\r\n  where a private school sends the wrong transcript to a former student's\r\n  potential employer and, as a direct result, the employer does not hire the\r\n  former student.Â  In both instances, the private entities could be held liable\r\n  for negligently maintaining an individual's records and thereby causing the\r\n  individual's injury.Â  Therefore, even if required, a private individual analogy\r\n  does exist where a private individual or private entity could be held liable\r\n  for similar conduct as alleged herein.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment against Carolina Chloride based on the absence of a private\r\n  sector analogy. \r\nIn addition to finding Carolina Chloride's claims barred under Â§\r\n  15-78-40, the trial court alternatively found Â§ 15-78-60(4) of the Tort Claims\r\n  Act barred Carolina Chloride from relief.Â  However, Carolina Chloride argues\r\n  the trial court erred because this Court is bound by our recent Quail Hill decision.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 15-78-60 of the Tort Claims Act contains affirmative defenses exempting\r\n  the government from liability. Â The governmental entity bears the burden of\r\n  establishing an affirmative defense under Â§ 15-78-60. Â Pike v. South\r\n    Carolina Dep't of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 230, 540 S.E.2d 87, 90 (2000). Â The\r\n  exceptions listed in Â§ 15-78-60 should be liberally construed to limit\r\n  liability. Â Steinke, 336 S.C. at 396, 520 S.E.2d at 154. Â Section\r\n  15-78-60(4) provides that the government is not liable for injuries resulting\r\n  from: &quot;adoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure to\r\n  adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited\r\n  to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, or written\r\n  policies.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005). \r\nCounty argues the trial court did not err because any alleged damage\r\n  claimed by Carolina Chloride arose as a result of County's enforcement of the\r\n  zoning ordinances for which Â§ 15-78-60(4) specifically grants governmental\r\n  immunity.Â  However, Carolina Chloride asserts its claims did not emanate from\r\n  the County's enforcement of local ordinances.Â  In support of this assertion,\r\n  Carolina Chloride argues the &quot;mistake&quot; or injuries in this case are directly\r\n  on point with the facts considered in Quail Hill.[6]Â  \r\nIn Quail Hill, the petitioner purchased over seventy acres of land\r\n  after a Richland County Planning Department staff member mistakenly advised him\r\n  the land was zoned for his intended use. Â Quail Hill, 379 S.C. at 317,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 195.Â  After the petitioner purchased the property, another staff\r\n  member informed him the property had a different zoning designation and he\r\n  could not develop the land as he had intended. Â Id. Â At trial and on\r\n  appeal, Richland County asserted Â§ 15-78-60(4) as an affirmative defense\r\n  arguing it was immune from liability for the incorrect zoning assessment because\r\n  appellant's claims arose as a result of the enforcement of local zoning\r\n  ordinances. Â Id. Â This court reversed summary judgment in favor of appellant\r\n  opining the claims asserted were not connected to the enforcement of the zoning\r\n  ordinance, but arose as a result of a Richland County staff member's mistaken\r\n  advice to appellant. Â Id. Â Therefore, this court concluded Richland\r\n  County was not immune from liability under Â§ 15-78-60(4). Â Id. \r\nHere, Carolina Chloride asserts County's alleged mistaken zoning assessment\r\n  resulted in the loss of a sale of real property and an associated business.Â \r\n  Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Carolina Chloride, the alleged\r\n  mistake purportedly occurred on February 13, 2003, when John Hicks, the employee\r\n  duly authorized to inform citizens whether their property was appropriately\r\n  zoned for their intended uses, informed Carolina Chloride the property at issue\r\n  was zoned rural (RU) and was not zoned heavy industrial (M-2).Â  Hicks made this\r\n  determination in response to a proposal for the development of the property sent\r\n  to County from the Watsons, the interested buyers.Â  However, in the letter, Hicks\r\n  rejected the Watsons' proposed plans because under RU zoning County could not\r\n  permit the expansion of &quot;the current . . . structural area.&quot; \r\nAppellants in this case and in Quail Hill alleged a governmental\r\n  entity negligently advised them of the zoning designations applicable to their\r\n  properties. Â In Quail Hill, the mistake arguably resulted in the\r\n  purchase of property that would not have been purchased had Richland County\r\n  accurately advised the purchaser. Â On the other hand, in the case at bar, the alleged\r\n  mistake ostensibly prevented the sale of property that would have been sold but\r\n  for County's authorized employee informing Carolina Chloride the property was\r\n  zoned for rural use only.Â  Regardless, both instances deal with tortious claims\r\n  emanating from a governmental entity issuing allegedly mistaken advice to\r\n  someone regarding applicable zoning ordinances. Â Accordingly, because we are\r\n  bound by this court's precedent, the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of\r\n  law that Â§ 15-78-60(4) barred Carolina Chloride's tort claims.\r\nIn addition to dismissing Carolina Chloride's claims\r\n  for negligence, gross negligence, and negligent misrepresentation on account of\r\n  the Tort Claims Act, the trial court made a separate finding that the cause of\r\n  action for negligent misrepresentation should also be dismissed on the ground\r\n  Carolina Chloride could have acquired knowledge of the proper zoning\r\n  designation from the public record.Â  Carolina Chloride argues the trial court\r\n  erred in this finding because Carolina Chloride did not have the ability to\r\n  ascertain the true zoning designation from the public records.Â  We agree.\r\nWe note when ruling on a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict, all reasonable inferences are viewed in the light most favorable to\r\n  the non-moving party.Â  Gadson, 374 S.C. at 175-76, 648 S.E.2d at 588.Â \r\n  Under the present facts, two different zoning department employees, including\r\n  the zoning administrator, reached different conclusions as to the zoning designation\r\n  of Carolina Chloride's property; therefore, it is difficult for this court to\r\n  conclude, as a matter of law, Carolina Chloride could have ascertained the true\r\n  zoning designation of the property merely by examining the public record on its\r\n  own.Â  Further, even assuming Carolina Chloride could have discovered the\r\n  subject property's true zoning designation through the public records,\r\n  generally, a question of fact exists as to whether reliance on a\r\n  misrepresentation was reasonable although the falsity of the alleged\r\n  misrepresentation could have been ascertained by examining public records.Â  See Slack v. James, 364 S.C. 609, 615, 614 S.E.2d 636, 639 (2005) (holding a\r\n  question of fact existed as to whether real estate purchasers' reliance on a\r\n  misrepresentation was reasonable when the falsity could have been discovered by\r\n  examining public records).Â  Thus, we find the trial court erred in dismissing\r\n  the negligent misrepresentation claim as a matter of law at the directed\r\n  verdict stage of the case.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Gross Negligence\r\nNotwithstanding our determination concerning sovereign\r\n  immunity, County argues the trial court properly dismissed the gross negligence\r\n  claim because Carolina Chloride offered no evidence supporting this claim.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nGross negligence is the failure to exercise slight\r\n  care. Jinks, 355 S.C. at 345, 585 S.E.2d at 283.Â  It also has been\r\n  defined as a relative term and means the absence of care that is necessary\r\n  under the circumstances.Â  Id.Â  In determining whether a directed verdict\r\n  was proper, this court must construe inferences arising from the evidence in\r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Gadson, 374 S.C. at\r\n  175-76, 648 S.E.2d at 588.\r\nIn support of its gross negligence claim, Carolina\r\n  Chloride references depositions not presented at trial as replete with evidence\r\n  of gross negligence.Â  &quot;We are confined to the record in deciding issues on\r\n  appeal.&quot;Â  Timms v. Timms, 286 S.C. 291, 294, 333 S.E.2d 74, 75 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1985) (refusing to review evidence of insurance coverage outside the record\r\n  on appeal).Â  As previously indicated, the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in excluding Brown's deposition in the absence of the requisite\r\n  foundation; therefore, it was not part of the record.Â  Additionally, Carolina\r\n  Chloride did not attempt to include the Gosline or Price depositions in the\r\n  record during trial and did not request that the record remain open in order to\r\n  supplement the record.Â  Consequently, these depositions were not in evidence\r\n  and will not be considered on appeal.\r\nTaking the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n  Carolina Chloride, the only evidence demonstrating County failed to exercise slight\r\n  care was in Hicks' mistaken zoning designation of the property at issue.Â  The\r\n  presence of a mistake alone, however, is not sufficient evidence to conclude\r\n  County failed to exercise slight care.Â  Furthermore, the February 13, 2003,\r\n  letter did state Hicks conferred with County's legal department prior to making\r\n  determinations about the subject property suggesting Hicks, and therefore County,\r\n  did exercise at least slight care.Â  Absent evidence to the contrary, the only\r\n  reasonable inference to be drawn from these facts is County, at a minimum,\r\n  exercised slight care.Â  See Pack v. Associated Marine Insts., Inc.,\r\n  362 S.C. 239, 246, 608 S.E.2d 134, 138 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding no genuine\r\n  issues of material fact existed for gross negligence claim where employees at\r\n  the very least exercised slight care).Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not\r\n  err in granting a directed verdict in favor of County on the gross negligence\r\n  claim.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Inverse Condemnation\r\nCarolina Chloride further alleges the trial court erred in granting a\r\n  directed verdict in favor of County on its inverse condemnation claim.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;An inverse condemnation may result from the government's physical\r\n  appropriation of private property, or it may result from government-imposed\r\n  limitations on the use of private property.&quot;Â  Byrd v. City of\r\n    Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2005).Â  In essence,\r\n  inverse condemnation is a governmental taking absent an eminent domain\r\n  proceeding. Id.Â  Successful inverse condemnation actions require a\r\n  plaintiff to establish the government committed an affirmative, aggressive, and\r\n  positive act causing damage to the plaintiff's property. Â WRB Ltd. P'ship v.\r\n    County of Lexington, 369 S.C. 30, 32, 630 S.E.2d 479, 481 (2006). \r\nThe only time frame in which the alleged taking could have occurred would\r\n  have been after County's February 13, 2003 letter.Â  Prior to this event,\r\n  Carolina Chloride used the property in compliance with M-2 zoning and absent\r\n  any alleged governmental interference.Â  Furthermore, Carolina Chloride cannot allege\r\n  a taking subsequent to County amending the property's zoning to M-2 on November\r\n  4, 2003, because M-2 zoning allowed all of Carolina Chloride's and the Watsons'\r\n  intended uses.Â  As such, the only taking, if any, occurred between February 13\r\n  and November 4, 2003.\r\nThe sole evidence Carolina Chloride presents of governmental action\r\n  constituting an affirmative act is Hicks' alleged mistaken assessment of the\r\n  zoning ordinances applicable to Carolina Chloride's property.Â  Even construing\r\n  the facts under a favorable light analysis, this action is not an &quot;affirmative,\r\n  aggressive, positive act&quot; damaging Carolina Chloride's property. See WRB Ltd. P'ship, 369 S.C. at 32, 630 S.E.2d at 481; see also Quail Hill, 379 S.C. at 322, 665 S.E.2d at 198 (finding no reported case\r\n  holding &quot;a mistake may rise to the level of an affirmative, aggressive, and\r\n  positive act sufficient to constitute inverse condemnation.&quot;). Â Accordingly,\r\n  the trial court properly granted a directed verdict in County's favor on the\r\n  inverse condemnation claim.Â  Â Â Â \r\nVII.&nbsp; Due Process\r\nCarolina Chloride argues the trial court erred in finding County did not deprive\r\n  Carolina Chloride of substantive due process.Â  Substantive due process\r\n  prohibits the government from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property\r\n  for arbitrary reasons. Worsley Cos., Inc., 339 S.C. at 56, 528 S.E.2d at\r\n  660.Â  &quot;To establish a substantive due process claim, a plaintiff must show\r\n  he possessed a constitutionally protected property interest that was deprived\r\n  by state action so far beyond the limits of legitimate governmental action, no\r\n  process could cure the deficiency.&quot; Â Seabrook v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191,\r\n  198, 631 S.E.2d 907, 911 (2006).Â  To prove a denial of substantive due process,\r\n  the plaintiff must also show &quot;he was arbitrarily and capriciously deprived\r\n  of a cognizable property interest rooted in state law.&quot;Â  Sloan v. South\r\n    Carolina Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 483, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  615 (2006).\r\nAt trial, County and Carolina Chloride appear to have confused substantive\r\n  and procedural due process. Â However, Carolina Chloride only makes a substantive\r\n  due process claim on appeal.Â  Specifically, Carolina Chloride asserts\r\n  deprivation of substantive due process because it claims County arbitrarily and\r\n  capriciously changed the zoning of the property.Â  Even assuming Carolina\r\n  Chloride had a property interest in the zoning designation of its property,\r\n  Carolina Chloride fails to proffer any evidence County actually changed the\r\n  zoning of the property.Â  Carolina Chloride merely evidences apparent confusion\r\n  within the zoning department as to the zoning designation of the property\r\n  arguably resulting in a mistake.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\r\n  granting a directed verdict in favor of County on the substantive due process\r\n  claim.\r\nVIII.Â  Governmental Estoppel and Promissory Estoppel\r\nIssues cannot be raised for the first time on appeal,\r\n  but must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to preserve it for\r\n  appellate review. Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733.Â  \r\nIn Carolina Chloride's statement of the issues on appeal, it argues the\r\n  trial court erred as a matter of law in finding no right to rely on government\r\n  employees.Â  While reliance is an element of several causes of action, Carolina\r\n  Chloride avers a right to rely on County in the context of governmental\r\n  estoppel.Â  At trial, Carolina Chloride initially argued governmental estoppel\r\n  and promissory estoppel.Â  Nevertheless, Carolina Chloride is barred on appeal\r\n  from asserting governmental estoppel since it subsequently expressly waived\r\n  this argument during trial.Â  Additionally, Carolina Chloride waives promissory\r\n  estoppel having failed to argue this issue in its initial appellate brief.Â  While\r\n  Carolina Chloride extensively briefs governmental estoppel and why the issues\r\n  of reliance and reasonableness are questions best resolved by a jury, it specifically\r\n  failed to address promissory estoppel as an issue on appeal.Â  As such, neither\r\n  of these issues are preserved for our review.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court's decision directing a verdict as\r\n  to constructive fraud, gross negligence, and inverse condemnation and reverse the\r\n  trial court's decision directing a verdict in favor of County on Carolina\r\n  Chloride's negligent misrepresentation and negligence claims and remand these\r\n  two causes of action for trial.[7] Â The trial court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] After filing the petition for rehearing, the parties\r\n  requested this court delay its decision on the petition for the last few months. \r\n[2] Carolina Chloride's realtor could not recall who told\r\n  him of the property's M-2 zoning.\r\n[3] Prior to oral arguments, County filed a motion with\r\n  this court to strike materials Carolina Chloride designated for inclusion in\r\n  the record on appeal, including the depositions of Terry Brown, Carl Gosline,\r\n  and Geonard Price.Â  This court denied the motion stating County was entitled to\r\n  argue in its appellate brief whether the contested items should be considered\r\n  on appeal.\r\n[4] While Carolina Chloride also references Rule\r\n  801(d)(2), SCRE in its brief on appeal, this argument was not made to the trial\r\n  court and is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (an issue cannot be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n[5] This court may affirm the trial court based on any\r\n  ground found in the record.Â  I'On, LLC v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338\r\n  S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000).\r\n[6] Carolina Chloride supplemented the record pursuant to\r\n  Rule 208(b)(7), SCACR, requesting the Court consider the Quail Hill decision.Â  We respectfully note Quail Hill was not available to the\r\n  trial court at the time of its decision.\r\n[7] We note the dissent in Quail Hill focused on\r\n  the fact the appellant therein had not dealt with the employee duly authorized\r\n  to deal with zoning, i.e. the zoning administrator.Â  Here, the facts are\r\n  different.Â  Carolina Chloride was interacting with the zoning administrator or\r\n  a duly authorized employee throughout the time period involved.Â  We also note,\r\n  unlike Quail Hill, this decision does not reach the governmental\r\n  estoppel argument because Carolina Chloride expressly waived the issue at\r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
