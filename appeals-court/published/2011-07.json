Cook and John K. Koon, of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Â Arrow Exterminating, Inc. (Arrow) and Twin City Fire Insurance Co.\r\n  (collectively, Appellants) appeal from the circuit court's order reversing the\r\n  Appellate Panel and finding that George Rabon was an employee of Arrow and\r\n  suffered a compensable injury.Â  Appellants argue the court erred in reversing\r\n  the Appellate Panel because Rabon made a material misrepresentation in his\r\n  employment application, which vitiated his employment contract with Arrow and\r\n  barred him from workers' compensation benefits.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nRabon was working\r\n  for Arrow as a carpenter on December 28, 2006, when he fell approximately six\r\n  to ten feet from his ladder, injuring his neck, back, and ribs, and resulting\r\n  in numbness and weakness in his left leg.Â  On January 17, 2007, Rabon filed a\r\n  Form 50, requesting that a hearing be set to determine whether he was entitled\r\n  to medical examination, treatment for neurosurgery and follow-up care, and\r\n  temporary total disability benefits from December 28, 2006, and continuing to\r\n  maximum medical improvement (MMI) as a result of the alleged injury. Â Arrow\r\n  timely filed its Form 51, answering Rabon's request and denying he was injured\r\n  in the scope of his employment with the company.Â  Arrow also raised all special\r\n  and affirmative defenses available under the S.C. Workers' Compensation Act,\r\n  and the defense enunciated in Cooper v. McDevitt &amp; Street Co., 260\r\n  S.C. 463, 468, 196 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1973), Â regarding a material false\r\n  statement made in a job application.\r\nA hearing on the\r\n  matter was set for April 10, 2007; however, prior to the commencement of the\r\n  hearing, Arrow moved for postponement, requesting more time to obtain all of\r\n  Rabon's medical records, records pertaining to Rabon's prior disability award\r\n  from the Workers' Compensation Commission, and the deposition of Dr. Byron\r\n  Bailey.Â  The Commissioner found Arrow had established good cause to postpone\r\n  the hearing and set the hearing for a later date.Â  The Commissioner heard the\r\n  case on June 26, 2007.Â  The next day, the Commissioner filed his order,\r\n  finding: (1) there was no evidence that Rabon knowingly and willfully made a\r\n  false representation regarding his physical condition and Arrow admitted Rabon\r\n  was physically able to do any job given to him in an exemplary manner; (2)\r\n  there was no material misrepresentation by Rabon that led to Rabon's injury on\r\n  December 28, 2006; (3) Rabon could not have materially misrepresented his past\r\n  injuries to Arrow if Arrow never inquired as to whether he had any past\r\n  injuries; (4) Arrow did not materially rely on Rabon's physical ability as the\r\n  primary purpose for hiring, but rather relied on the skills he possessed as a\r\n  carpenter when he applied for the job; (5) Rabon was entitled to temporary\r\n  total benefits; (6) Arrow was required to pay past due and continuing temporary\r\n  total benefits until Rabon reaches MMI; and (7) Arrow was to pay all medical\r\n  bills for Rabon's neck surgery and all future medical care. \r\nArrow appealed\r\n  the case to the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission, and on\r\n  January 17, 2008, the panel issued its order reversing the order of the Single\r\n  Commissioner.Â  The Appellate Panel found Rabon sustained an injury by accident\r\n  and the employee-employer relationship existed at the time of the injury;\r\n  however, it found the injury was not compensable because Rabon made a false\r\n  representation to Arrow as to his physical condition, which induced Arrow to\r\n  find he was a suitable candidate for the carpenter position.Â  The Panel also\r\n  found Rabon was not credible, and a causal connection existed between Rabon's\r\n  false representation and his injury because had he informed Arrow of his\r\n  condition, Arrow would not have placed him in a position where he could further\r\n  aggravate his injury.Â  Thus, the Panel found Rabon was not entitled to any\r\n  workers' compensation benefits.Â  \r\nRabon appealed\r\n  the Appellate Panel's decision to the circuit court.Â  After a hearing on the\r\n  matter, the court filed its order on September 22, 2008, reversing the order of the Appellate Panel.Â  The court held: (1) Rabon did not knowingly or willfully\r\n  make a false representation as to his physical condition because the\r\n  application did not ask about Rabon's physical condition or any prior injuries\r\n  sustained by Rabon, and Arrow's interviewer did not ask Rabon about his\r\n  physical condition; and (2) Arrow failed to establish a causal connection\r\n  between Rabon's alleged false representation and his injuries because nothing\r\n  in the record established that Rabon's pre-existing injuries caused Rabon to\r\n  fall off the ladder.Â  Therefore, the court determined that because the\r\n  employment was not induced by fraud and the Appellate Panel found an injury by\r\n  accident, Rabon was entitled to temporary total benefits and medical benefits\r\n  as set forth in the Single Commissioner's order.Â  Arrow filed a motion to\r\n  reconsider, which the circuit court denied on May 22, 2009.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial\r\n  review of decisions by the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission.&nbsp; Fredrick v. Wellman, Inc., 385 S.C. 8, 15-16, 682\r\n  S.E.2d 516, 519 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse or modify the Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced because the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law or is &quot;clearly erroneous in view\r\n  of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010); Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc.,\r\n  360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Our supreme court has\r\n  defined substantial evidence as evidence that, in viewing the record as a\r\n  whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the Appellate\r\n  Panel reached.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  &quot;[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the\r\n  evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v.\r\n    S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696\r\n  (1984).&nbsp; \r\nRecently, in Brayboy v.\r\n  WorkForce, 383 S.C. 463, 464, 681 S.E.2d 567, 567 (2009), our supreme court\r\n  determined that when reviewing a case where the employer asserts the employee's\r\n  concealment of prior injuries vitiated the employment relationship, this court\r\n  reviews the Appellate Panel's findings on the relationship's existence\r\n  according to our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  See Fredrick,\r\n  385 S.C. at 16, 682 S.E.2d at 519-20 (citing Brayboy).Â  &quot;However,\r\n  even under this broad standard of review, the final determination of witness\r\n  credibility is usually reserved to the Appellate Panel.&quot;Â  Fredrick,\r\n  385 at 16, 682 S.E.2d at 520.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in reversing the Appellate Panel's decision because\r\n  Rabon made a material misrepresentation in his employment application, which\r\n  vitiated his employment\r\n  contract with Arrow and barred him from workers' compensation benefits.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAn employee is not entitled\r\n  to recover workers' compensation benefits if he or she makes a false statement\r\n  in his or her employment application and the following factors are present: (1)\r\n  the employee knowingly and willfully made a false representation as to his or\r\n  her physical condition; (2) the employer relied upon the false representation\r\n  and this reliance was a substantial factor in the hiring; and (3) there was a\r\n  causal connection between the false representation and the injury.Â  Cooper v. McDevitt &amp; St. Co., 260 S.C. 463, 468, 196 S.E.2d 833, 835\r\n  (1973); Fredrick v. Wellman, Inc.,\r\n  385 S.C. 8, 20, 682 S.E.2d 516, 522 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  All three factors must be\r\n  present for the employer to avoid paying benefits to the employee.Â  Vines v.\r\n    Champion Bldg. Prods., 315 S.C. 13, 16, 431 S.E.2d 585, 586 (1993).Â  \r\nIn Brayboy v. WorkForce,\r\n  383 S.C. 463, 464-65, 681 S.E.2d 567, 567-68 (2009), despite having multiple\r\n  prior back problems, Brayboy answered in the negative to all the questions in\r\n  the employment application about prior back injuries, physical defects, medical\r\n  conditions, or previous workers' compensation claims.Â  Our supreme court found\r\n  WorkForce had established the first factor because Brayboy's false responses\r\n  were willful, and Brayboy admitted he provided false information on his\r\n  application.Â  Id. at 467, 681 S.E.2d at 569.Â  Also, in Fredrick, 385\r\n  S.C. at 20-21, 682 S.E.2d at 522, this court found Fredrick knowingly falsified\r\n  her employment questionnaire as to her prior back problems when she responded\r\n  &quot;no&quot; to the question &quot;Have you had back trouble of any kind?,&quot;\r\n  and she had previously received significant treatment for lower back pain and a\r\n  disc herniation.\r\nIn contrast, in Ferguson\r\n  v. R.F. Moore Construction Co., 298 S.C. 457, 461, 381 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1989), this court found that Ferguson's statements to the construction\r\n  company that he was a good laborer, strong, and able to operate a jackhammer\r\n  did not mislead the employer because nothing in the record indicated Ferguson\r\n  believed his statements were not true, and he did not make any representations\r\n  concerning his back.\r\nHere, on the first page of\r\n  the application in the lines next to &quot;Subjects of Special Study/Research,\r\n  Work, or Special Training/Skills,&quot; Rabon stated he could do\r\n  &quot;painting, finishing sheetrock, tile, trim work, framing, plumbing,\r\n  heating &amp; air, vinyl siding, roofing, windows, hang doors, run gas line,\r\n  little bit electric, run my own crew.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  The application did not ask Rabon if he had any current or prior injuries.Â  Chuck Inabinet hired Rabon, and was his\r\n  direct supervisor.Â  Inabinet asked Rabon\r\n  if he could crawl under houses and do carpentry work, and Rabon said he could.Â  Inabinet did not ask Rabon\r\n  about his prior injuries, and Rabon did not volunteer to tell him about them.Â  Rabon did not have an affirmative duty to disclose his\r\n  prior injuries to Arrow.Â  See id. at 460, 381 S.E.2d at 498-99 (rejecting\r\n  employer's contention that claimant had an affirmative duty to disclose his\r\n  prior injury).Â  \r\nAdditionally, nothing in\r\n  Rabon's application was false.Â  Despite his previous injuries, Rabon was able\r\n  to do all the jobs assigned to him by Arrow.Â  Rabon had been working for Arrow for almost a\r\n  year when he fell in December 2006, and he testified that during\r\n  that time, he was never given a job he could not do because of his past\r\n  physical injuries; he never missed any\r\n  work because of problems with his neck or back; and he never needed a\r\n  reassignment or required any special assistance in doing any jobs Arrow gave to\r\n  him.Â  Inabinet testified Rabon was physically able to do all the jobs he hired\r\n  him to do; he never saw Rabon take any medication to &quot;help him through the\r\n  day&quot;; and Rabon never had to quit a job because he was having problems\r\n  with pain or bodily functions.Â  David Clark, the president of Arrow, testified\r\n  that prior to Rabon's fall, he was doing his work in a normal fashion and was\r\n  not complaining about being in any pain.Â  Clark also testified that Rabon was\r\n  always physically able to do his work.Â  Wesley Byars, who worked with Rabon\r\n  daily, testified that Rabon was physically able to do the work, and he never\r\n  heard Rabon say he could not do a job because of pain.\r\nTherefore, because Arrow\r\n  never asked Rabon if he had any current or prior injuries, and regardless of\r\n  his injuries, Rabon was physically able to do all the jobs Arrow hired him to\r\n  do, we find Rabon did not knowingly and willfully make a false representation\r\n  as to his physical condition.Â  Consequently, because we find Rabon did not\r\n  knowingly and willfully make a false representation as to his physical\r\n  condition, we need not address the second and third factors.Â  See Vines,\r\n  315 S.C. at 16, 431 S.E.2d at 586 (stating all three factors must be present\r\n  for the employer to avoid paying benefits to the employee); Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\n  its determination of another issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nAppellants also assert the\r\n  circuit court erred in disregarding the Appellate Panel's finding that Rabon\r\n  was not credible.Â  However, we need not address this issue because we find Rabon\r\n  did not knowingly and willfully make a false representation as to his physical\r\n  condition.Â  See Futch, 335 S.C. at 613, 518 S.E.2d at 598\r\n  (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\n  determination of another issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]The parties all agree Rabon is illiterate, Rabon's\r\n  wife filled out his employment application, and Rabon signed his name.Â  The application\r\n  provided in the Record is only one page; however, at the bottom of the page, it\r\n  says &quot;Continued on other Side.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4850","title":"State v, Hinojos","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4850","description":"Richard G.

Thompson, d/b/a All-Out Bail Bonding (All Out), and Accredited Property and\r\n  Casualty Insurance (collectively, the Appellants) appeal the trial court's\r\n  estreatment of Mario Hinojos's bond.Â  The Appellants contend the trial court abused\r\n  its discretion by modifying Hinojos's bond without proper notice and consent. Â The\r\n  Appellants also argue their obligations under the bond were completed at the\r\n  time of Hinojos's guilty plea.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 18, 2005,\r\n  Hinojos was arrested in Greenville County and charged with trafficking\r\n  methamphetamine and cocaine, conspiracy to traffic methamphetamine and\r\n  marijuana, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n  Â On August 22, 2005, the trial court set a $200,000 surety bond that included\r\n  conditions that Hinojos be placed on electronic monitoring, maintain contact\r\n  with the State Grand Jury Clerk, report weekly to South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division (SLED) Special Agent Max Dorsey, and not leave the state.Â  Hinojos\r\n  procured three bonding companies to secure his release: Â the Appellants; Tracy\r\n  Bowen, d/b/a Bonds by Gaynell; and Leon Stowers, d/b/a Giggie's Bonding\r\n  Company. Â Each bonding company was responsible for one-third of the\r\n  total bond, or $66,666.66. \r\nAt a March 15, 2007\r\n  hearing, the trial court granted Hinojos's motion to have the electronic\r\n  monitoring condition of his bond removed. Â Written notice of the hearing\r\n  was not provided to the three bondsmen, and none were present at the hearing.Â \r\n  On November 20, 2007, Hinojos entered guilty pleas to each of the five charges\r\n  against him. Â Hinojos's sentencing was deferred until his testimony in\r\n  the trial of a co-conspirator the week of December 10, 2007.[1] Â Hinojos requested the trial court allow him to remain out of jail on bond\r\n  pending his cooperation in his co-conspirator's trial. Â The State did\r\n  not oppose Hinojos's request, provided the bonding companies agreed to remain\r\n  on the bond. Â Mike Curlee, representing All Out, was the only bondsman present\r\n  at the guilty plea and consented to remain on the bond until Hinojos's sentencing. \r\nOn December 10,\r\n  2007, Hinojos failed to appear in court for sentencing as ordered. All three\r\n  bondsmen were present when the trial court verbally issued a bench warrant for\r\n  Hinojos's arrest. Subsequently, on January 17, 2008, the State filed a Petition\r\n  for Estreatment of Bond against all three bonding companies. Â Estreatment\r\n  hearings were held in March and November 2008. Â At the November 7, 2008 hearing,\r\n  the State conceded a modification was made to Hinojos's bond on March 15, 2007,\r\n  without the notice or consent of the three bondsmen.Â  The State also withdrew\r\n  its Petition for Estreatment of Bond against all of the bondsmen except the\r\n  Appellants because Curlee was present at the guilty plea and consented to\r\n  remain on the bond. Â Â \r\nÂ On April 15, 2009,\r\n  the trial court estreated $66,666.66 of Hinojos's $200,000 bond to the State. Â In\r\n  its order, the trial court noted the Appellants were given &quot;notice and\r\n  hearing&quot; of Hinojos's guilty plea as required by section 17-15-50 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2003) and Curlee appeared and orally agreed to the\r\n  conditions of the bond. Â The trial court determined that while bond\r\n  modifications must comply with the Statute of Frauds, equitable estoppel may be\r\n  invoked to bar the Statute of Frauds. Â The trial court noted that &quot;estoppel\r\n  applies if a person, by his action, conduct, words, or silence which amounts to\r\n  a representation, or a concealment of material facts causes another to alter\r\n  his position to his prejudice of injury.&quot;Â  The trial court held that the\r\n  State &quot;suffered a definite, substantial, detrimental change of position in\r\n  reliance on the proposed agreement&quot; after Curlee agreed to remain on the\r\n  bond and Hinojos did not appear for sentencing. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot; State v.\r\n  Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  Thus, this court is\r\n  bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Â Id.Â \r\n  &quot;On review, this [c]ourt is limited to determining whether the [trial]\r\n  court abused its discretion.&quot; Â Â State v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 158,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 19, 26 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; March 15, 2007 Bond\r\n  Modification\r\nThe Appellants argue the trial court erred in\r\n  estreating Hinojos's bond where there was a modification of the bond without\r\n  the proper notice and consent of the Appellants.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Appellants argue they were not given proper notice\r\n  of the removal of Hinojos's electronic monitoring device.Â  They maintain they\r\n  were not notified of the March 15, 2007 hearing and did not consent to the bond\r\n  modification. Â The Appellants also assert Hinojos's bond was originally\r\n  in writing and was not modified in writing as required by the Statute of\r\n  Frauds.Â  The Appellants rely on State v. McIntyre, 307 S.C. 363, 365,\r\n  415 S.E.2d 399, 400 (1992), where our supreme court determined the bond\r\n  modification at issue violated the Statute of Frauds and section 17-15-50\r\n  because it was not in writing and the surety was not properly notified.\r\nThe State concedes the Appellants were not properly\r\n  notified of the March 15, 2007 hearing; however, the State maintains the\r\n  Appellants erroneously argue the March 15, 2007 bond modification is the bond\r\n  modification at issue. The State asserts it complied with the notice and hearing\r\n  requirements of section 17-15-50 and properly notified the Appellants of\r\n  Hinojos's November 20, 2007 guilty plea.Â  The State maintains the Appellants\r\n  were represented at Hinojos's plea and consented to remain on the bond.\r\nWe agree with the State that the March 15, 2007 bond\r\n  modification is not the modification at issue in this case.Â  While the\r\n  Appellants were not properly notified of the March 15, 2007 hearing, Hinojos\r\n  still appeared before the trial court in November 2007 and entered a guilty\r\n  plea. Â Curlee also appeared at the guilty plea and agreed to remain on the bond\r\n  after the trial court stated the conditions of the bond, which did not include\r\n  electronic monitoring. Â We find this case is distinguishable from McIntyre.Â \r\n  In McIntyre, the surety did not agree to remain on the bond after a\r\n  modification. 307 S.C. at 365, 415 S.E.2d at 400.Â  Here, although Curlee was\r\n  not notified of the March bond modification, he agreed at the November hearing\r\n  to remain on the bond after the modification. Therefore, the issue before us is\r\n  whether estreatment was proper after Curlee, on behalf of the Appellants, consented\r\n  to the bond modification and agreed to remain on the bond after Hinojos's November\r\n  2007 guilty plea.\r\nII.&nbsp;Equitable Estoppel\r\nThe Appellants argue the trial court erred in\r\n  estreating Hinojos's bond where their obligations were completed at the time of\r\n  Hinojos's plea.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The State's right to bond estreatment arises\r\n  from contract.&quot;Â  McIntyre, 307 S.C. at 364, 415 S.E.2d at 400. Â Pursuant\r\n  to the South Carolina Statute of Frauds, a promise to answer for the debt of\r\n  another must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§\r\n  32-3-10(2) (2007). Â &quot;The general rule is that the court cannot redraft a\r\n  bond so as to impose conditions or obligations not contemplated by the\r\n  parties.&quot;Â  State v. White, 284 S.C. 69, 71, 325 S.E.2d 64, 65\r\n  (1985).Â  Pursuant to section 17-15-50, &quot;the court may, at any time after\r\n  notice and hearing, amend the order to impose additional or different\r\n  conditions of release.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-50 (2003).Â  \r\nThe doctrine of estoppel may be invoked to prevent a\r\n  party from asserting the Statute of Frauds.Â  Atlantic Wholesale Co. v.\r\n  Solondz, 283 S.C. 36, 41, 320 S.E.2d 720, 723 (Ct. App. 1984). Â Â Estoppel &quot;applies\r\n  if a person, by his actions, conduct, words or silence which amounts to a representation,\r\n  or a concealment of material facts, causes another to alter his position to his\r\n  prejudice or injury.&quot;Â  Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 293, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 917, 924 (Ct. App. 2006). Â &quot;In order to overcome statutory\r\n  requirements that an agreement be in writing, the party asserting estoppel must\r\n  show that he suffered a definite, substantial, detrimental change of position\r\n  in reliance on such agreement and that no remedy except enforcement of the\r\n  bargain is adequate to restore his former position.&quot;Â  Player v.\r\n  Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 106, 382 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1989).Â  \r\nThe Appellants maintain their obligations under\r\n  Hinojos's bond were completed after his guilty plea, and the subsequent\r\n  agreement by Curlee to remain on the bond was not enforceable because it was\r\n  not in writing and did not satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The Appellants argue\r\n  that without an agreement by all three bondsmen, the trial court created and\r\n  imposed new obligations outside the original bond. The State argues the\r\n  Appellants' obligations were not completed at the time of Hinojos's plea, but\r\n  continued until Hinojos's sentencing. The State maintains the trial\r\n  court properly determined the Statute of Frauds was barred by equitable estoppel,\r\n  and that but for Curlee's agreement to remain on the bond, the State would have\r\n  opposed Hinojos's release.Â  \r\nWe agree with the State and find the trial court did\r\n  not err in determining the doctrine of equitable estoppel barred the Statute of\r\n  Frauds.Â  At the guilty plea, the State informed the trial court that it did not\r\n  oppose Hinojos's request to remain out on bond until his sentencing, provided\r\n  the bondsman agreed to continue on the bond.Â  The trial court advised Hinojos of\r\n  the conditions of his bond, including that he stay in contact with his\r\n  attorney, the clerk of court, and SLED.Â  Hinojos's attorney informed the court that\r\n  Curlee was present and agreed to remain on the bond. Â Subsequently, the\r\n  trial court again stated the conditions of Hinojos's bond, which did not\r\n  include electronic monitoring, and Curlee agreed to remain on the bond, stating\r\n  he could only answer for All Out and not the other bondsmen. Â The State informed\r\n  the court that if Hinojos did not show up for sentencing it would move to\r\n  estreat his bond. \r\nÂ While Curlee's agreement to remain on Hinojos's bond\r\n  was not in writing, we find the Appellants are still liable on the bond\r\n  pursuant to the doctrine of equitable estoppel. Curlee orally agreed to continue\r\n  on the bond, and the State relied upon this agreement to its detriment. Â But\r\n  for Curlee's representation to the trial court, the State would not have\r\n  consented to Hinojos's release and he would have been taken into custody. Â Because\r\n  the State relied upon Curlee's agreement, the Appellants are equitably estopped\r\n  from denying liability on the bond. \r\nIII.&nbsp;Abuse of Discretion\r\nThe Appellants argue the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion in estreating $66,666.66 of Hinojos's $200,000 bond.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 38-53-70 of the South Carolina Code (2010)\r\n  provides, &quot;[i]n making a determination as to remission of the judgment,\r\n  the court shall consider the costs to the State or any county or municipality\r\n  resulting from the necessity to continue or terminate the defendant's trial and\r\n  the efforts of law enforcement officers or agencies to locate the\r\n  defendant.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-70 (2010). Â Furthermore, in Ex parte Polk,\r\n  354 S.C. 8, 13, 579 S.E.2d 329, 331 (Ct. App. 2003), this court determined:\r\n[w]hile\r\n  the decision regarding remission is within the discretion of the trial court,\r\n  the court should consider, at a minimum, the costs to the State as well as the\r\n  purpose of the bond and the nature and willfulness of the default in\r\n  determining whether, and to what extent, a bond forfeiture should be remitted.\r\nThe Appellants argue the trial court failed to\r\n  consider the three factors established in Polk. The State\r\n  maintains the trial court did not abuse its discretion and argues the trial\r\n  court held two rule to show cause hearings, reviewed the transcripts, and requested\r\n  briefs from both parties.Â  The State also maintains the Appellants failed to\r\n  show the trial court did not consider the Polk factors. \r\nWe agree with the Appellants. Â As noted by this court\r\n  in Polk, section 38-53-70 &quot;unambiguously provides that the trial\r\n  court must consider the costs to the State in determining remission of the\r\n  judgment on a forfeited bond.&quot; Â 354 S.C. at 12, 579 S.E.2d at 331. Â The\r\n  trial court should also examine, at the least, the purpose of the bond and the\r\n  nature and willfulness of the default.Â  Id. at 13, 579 S.E.2d at 331.Â  We\r\n  believe Hinojos's bond was forfeited and the trial court properly entered\r\n  judgment on the bond.Â  However, because the trial court failed to address, at a\r\n  minimum, the three factors set forth in Polk, we find it abused its\r\n  discretion in ordering the estreatment of Hinojos's bond in the amount of $66,666.66.\r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's estreatment amount determination and\r\n  remand to the trial court to consider the Polk factors in its reconsideration\r\n  of the estreatment amount.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial court's estreatment of Hinojos's\r\n  bond.Â  We reverse the trial court's estreatment amount determination and remand\r\n  to the trial court to consider the Polk factors in its reconsideration\r\n  of the estreatment amount.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The trafficking methamphetamine and cocaine charges\r\n  to which Hinojos pled guilty carried mandatory minimum sentences of seven\r\n  years' incarceration. Â At the guilty plea, the State recommended a cap of ten\r\n  years' concurrent incarceration on all charges.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4851","title":"Davis v, KB Home of SC","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4851","description":"In this wrongful termination case, KB Home of South Carolina, Inc. and Jeff Meyer (collectively Appellants) appeal a circuit court judgment denying their motion to compel arbitration.

(collectively Appellants) appeal a circuit court judgment denying their motion\r\n  to compel arbitration.Â  On appeal, Appellants contend the circuit court erred\r\n  in: (1) determining the validity of an arbitration clause contained in Lonnie\r\n  Davis's employment application when that threshold determination was arguably\r\n  for the arbitrator, (2) finding Appellants waived their right to enforce the\r\n  arbitration clause by actively participating in litigation for eighteen months\r\n  before seeking to compel arbitration, and (3) finding the alleged arbitration clause\r\n  to be an unconscionable and unenforceable contract of adhesion.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDavis\r\n  applied for employment with KB Home on January 12, 2006.Â  Davis's employment\r\n  application contained an arbitration clause, stating as follows:\r\n\r\n  I understand and\r\n    agree that if employed, I will be required to arbitrate any disputes arising\r\n      out of or related to my employment with or termination from the Company,\r\n    including any claims for discrimination, harassment, retaliation and/or\r\n    wrongful termination.Â  I understand that only an arbitrator, not a judge or a\r\n    jury, will hear such disputes.Â  I further understand that this term and\r\n    condition of my employment may not be changed except by written agreement\r\n    specifically for such purpose entered into between myself and the Company and\r\n    signed by the President of the division or the Company's Sr. Vice President of\r\n    Human Resources, and that such term and condition of my employment shall not be\r\n    affected by any other employment policies or programs, in writing or otherwise,\r\n    relating to other terms and conditions of my employment and that such policies\r\n    and programs are subject to change at any time for any reason by the Company at\r\n    its discretion and that I have no vested rights in any Company policy or\r\n    program now or hereafter in effect.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The employment application also stated &quot;I understand that this\r\n  application remains current for only 30 days.&quot;Â  Davis signed the\r\n  employment application underneath the following statement: &quot;I certify that\r\n  I have read, fully understand and accept all of the above terms.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 13, 2006, sixty days later, Davis was offered a position as the Vice\r\n  President of Finance with KB Home.Â  Davis signed an employment agreement\r\n  containing a merger clause.Â  The merger clause provided:\r\n\r\n  Entire Agreement:Â  This\r\n    letter together with the documents referenced herein contain all of the\r\n    agreements and understandings regarding your employment and the obligations of\r\n    KB Home in connection with employment.Â  KB Home has not made, nor are you\r\n    relying upon any oral or written promises or statements made by KB Home or any\r\n    agent of KB Home except as expressly set forth herein.Â  This letter\r\n      supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings between you and KB\r\n      Home and alone expresses the agreement of the parties.Â  This letter containing all of the agreements and understandings regarding\r\n    your employment can only be amended in writing by the Senior Vice President,\r\n    Human Resources of KB Home.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nKB\r\n  Home terminated Davis on July 20, 2007.Â  Davis subsequently brought a lawsuit\r\n  against Appellants on March 3, 2008, for breach of contract, breach of contract\r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act, violation of the South Carolina Payment of\r\n  Wages Act, wrongful termination/retaliation, and defamation.Â  Davis claimed he\r\n  was fired for reporting numerous infractions by KB Home employees, including\r\n  various managers' demeaning and harassing conduct toward female employees as\r\n  well as numerous fraudulent and unethical financial transactions in violation\r\n  of the civil and criminal laws of South Carolina.\r\nThe\r\n  parties engaged in discovery, filing multiple sets of interrogatories and\r\n  requests for production of documents.Â  Both Davis and Appellants produced\r\n  documents and filed responses to the opposing parties' interrogatories.Â  In\r\n  addition, Appellants noticed and rescheduled Davis's deposition on five\r\n  separate occasions.Â  Appellants filed a motion to dismiss, which the circuit\r\n  court heard and denied on January 9, 2009.Â  A scheduling order was signed by\r\n  the circuit court on April 30, 2009.Â  \r\nDavis\r\n  filed a motion to compel discovery on July 13, 2009.Â  Specifically, Davis\r\n  suggested Appellants' responses to Davis's first set of interrogatories and\r\n  requests for production were inadequate.Â  On July 28, 2009, Appellants filed a\r\n  motion for entry of a confidentiality order with respect to Davis's discovery\r\n  requests.Â  On August 5, 2009, Appellants filed a memorandum in response to\r\n  Davis's motion to compel discovery.Â  The parties consented to an amended\r\n  scheduling order, which was signed on August 7, 2009.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  September of 2009, eighteen months after Davis filed his complaint, Appellants\r\n  filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings.Â  Davis filed\r\n  a response to the motion to compel arbitration.Â  Davis argued the merger clause\r\n  in his subsequent employment agreement superseded the prior employment\r\n  application containing an arbitration clause.Â  Davis further argued Appellants\r\n  waived their right to seek arbitration by waiting eighteen months to file a\r\n  motion to compel arbitration.Â  Davis suggested the parties had engaged in\r\n  extensive discovery, thereby giving Appellants an unfair advantage should the\r\n  case go to arbitration.Â  Finally, Davis argued the arbitration clause was an\r\n  unconscionable contract of adhesion, and therefore unenforceable by an\r\n  arbitrator.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court held a hearing on the motion to compel and denied the motion.Â \r\n  The circuit court noted &quot;[t]he reason for the denial is as set forth in\r\n  [Davis's] memorandum, all of the reasons stated.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  The circuit court issued a Form 4 judgment denying Appellants' motion to compel\r\n  arbitration on October 30, 2009.Â  Appellants did not file a motion to alter or\r\n  amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n1.&nbsp; Is\r\n  it for a court or an arbitrator to determine the threshold validity of an\r\n  arbitration clause contained in Davis's employment application when a merger\r\n  clause in the resulting employment agreement arguably superseded the application\r\n  thereby rendering the arbitration clause invalid, and when the employment application\r\n  stated it would expire after 30 days?\r\n2.&nbsp; Did\r\n  KB Home and Meyer waive their right to enforce the arbitration clause in\r\n  Davis's employment application by actively participating in litigation for\r\n  eighteen months before seeking to compel arbitration?\r\n3.&nbsp; Is\r\n  the arbitration clause an unconscionable and unenforceable contract of\r\n  adhesion?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Arbitrability\r\n  determinations are subject to de novo review.&quot;Â  Simpson v. MSA\r\n    of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 22, 644 S.E.2d 663, 667&nbsp;(2007)\r\n  (emphasis added). Â &quot;Nevertheless,\r\n  a circuit court's factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any\r\n  evidence reasonably supports the findings.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The denial of a\r\n  motion to compel arbitration, based on a finding of waiver, is reviewed on\r\n  appeal de novo.&quot;Â  Rich v. Walsh, 357 S.C. 64, 68, 590 S.E.2d 506,\r\n  508&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Court\r\n  versus Arbitrator\r\nWe\r\n  first address the issue of whether it was proper for the circuit court, as\r\n  opposed to an arbitrator, to address the threshold validity of the arbitration\r\n  clause contained in Davis's employment application.\r\n&quot;Unless\r\n  the parties have contracted to the contrary, the FAA [Federal Arbitration Act] applies in federal\r\n  or state court to any arbitration agreement regarding a transaction that in\r\n  fact involves interstate commerce, regardless of whether or not the parties\r\n  contemplated an interstate transaction.&quot;Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp.,\r\n  343 S.C. 531, 538, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363&nbsp;(2001).Â  Neither party challenges\r\n  the circuit court's application of the FAA to the employment agreement in the\r\n  instant case.Â  Therefore, this court need not address whether this contract\r\n  qualifies as a transaction involving interstate commerce.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v.\r\n    Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997)\r\n  (stating that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).\r\n&quot;[E]ven\r\n  in cases where the FAA otherwise applies, general contract principles of state\r\n  law apply in a court's evaluation of the enforceability of an arbitration\r\n  clause.&quot;Â  Simpson, 373 S.C. at 22 n.1, 644 S.E.2d at 667 n.1; see\r\n    also Munoz, 343 S.C. at 539, 542 S.E.2d at 364&nbsp;(&quot;General\r\n  contract principles of state law apply to arbitration clauses governed by the\r\n  FAA.&quot;).Â  Therefore, our analysis under South Carolina law is\r\n  &quot;ultimately the same&quot; as the analysis under federal law.Â  Simpson,\r\n  373 S.C. at 22 n.1, 644 S.E.2d at 667 n.1.Â  Appellants contend Simpson is inapplicable to the present matter because it was governed by the South\r\n  Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA), whereas the instant case is governed by\r\n  the FAA.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  the supreme court noted in Simpson, this distinction is insignificant as\r\n  the UAA and FAA provisions at issue are nearly identical.Â  Compare 9 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§\r\n  2, 4 (West 2009), with S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-48-10(a), -20(a) (2005).Â  The FAA\r\n  provides: &quot;The\r\n  court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of\r\n    the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not\r\n      in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to\r\n  arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.&quot;Â  9 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  4 (West\r\n  2009) (emphasis added); accord S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a) (2005)\r\n  (noting &quot;if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to\r\n    arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of the issue\r\n    so raised and shall order arbitration if found for the moving party,\r\n  otherwise, the application shall be denied&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\n&quot;Arbitration\r\n  is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required to submit to\r\n  arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.&quot;Â  Zabinski\r\n    v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118&nbsp;(2001); see also 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2 (West 2009) (noting arbitration agreements\r\n  subject to the FAA &quot;shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\r\n  upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\r\n  contract&quot;); 7 Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the\r\n    Law of Contracts Â§ 15:11 (4th ed. 1997) (&quot;The usual principles and\r\n  standards of interpretation applicable to other contracts are said to govern arbitration\r\n  agreements.&quot;).Â  \r\nArbitration\r\n  clauses are severable from the contracts in which they are embedded.Â  S.C.\r\n    Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal, 312 S.C. 559, 563, 437 S.E.2d 22, 24\r\n  (1993); The\r\n    Hous. Auth. of City of Columbia v. Cornerstone Housing, L.L.C., 356 S.C. 328,\r\n  338, 588 S.E.2d 617, 622&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003). Â Therefore, &quot;the issue of\r\n  [the arbitration clause's] validity is distinct from the substantive validity\r\n  of the contract as a whole.&quot;Â  Munoz, 343 S.C. at 540, 542 S.E.2d at\r\n  364.Â  &quot;[A]\r\n  party cannot avoid arbitration through rescission of the entire contract when\r\n  there is no independent challenge to the arbitration clause.&quot;Â  Great W. Coal, 312 S.C. at\r\n  562-63, 437 S.E.2d at 24.\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 445-46 (2006), governs\r\n  the outcome of the present case because Davis is challenging the existence of\r\n  the entire agreement and not just the arbitration provision.Â  See id. at 444 (noting challenges to the validity of arbitration agreements can be\r\n  divided into two distinct types: (1) specific challenges to the validity of the\r\n  agreement to arbitrate, and (2) challenges to the contract as a whole).Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nDavis\r\n  does not suggest his entire employment agreement was invalid.Â  Rather, Davis\r\n  contests only the validity of the arbitration clause contained in his\r\n  employment application in light of the subsequent employment offer letter,\r\n  which contained a merger clause.Â  Therefore, Davis's challenge is to the validity\r\n  of the arbitration clause contained in his employment application.Â  The\r\n  employment application cannot be considered the entire employment agreement.Â  We\r\n  conclude Davis is making a specific challenge to the existence of the\r\n  arbitration clause, and not a challenge to the entire employment agreement.[3] Â Cf. Buckeye Check Cashing, 546 U.S. at 445-46 (noting that arbitration\r\n  provisions are severable from the remainder of the contract, and when a party\r\n  challenges the contract as a whole as opposed to specifically challenging the\r\n  arbitration provision, the contract's validity is considered by the arbitrator in\r\n  the first instance).\r\nIn\r\n  addition, the arbitration clause in the instant matter did not expressly\r\n  provide that any issues relating to the validity, existence, and scope of the\r\n  arbitration agreement would be submitted to an arbitrator.Â  Therefore, we hold the\r\n  determination regarding whether a valid arbitration agreement existed was a\r\n  &quot;gateway matter&quot; that the circuit court could properly consider.Â  Simpson,\r\n  373 S.C. at 23, 644 S.E.2d at 668 (noting that certain &quot;gateway\r\n  matters&quot; relating to the existence of an arbitration agreement are for the\r\n  court to decide absent &quot;clear and unmistakable&quot; evidence to\r\n  the contrary) (emphasis added).\r\nA. Merger\r\n  Clause\r\nHaving\r\n  concluded the circuit court properly considered Appellants' arguments, as\r\n  opposed to submitting them to an arbitrator, we proceed to address the\r\n  arguments on the merits.Â  Appellants contend the circuit court erred in concluding\r\n  that the provisions of Davis's employment application were superseded and\r\n  rendered invalid by the presence of a merger clause in his subsequent employment\r\n  agreement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  evaluate this argument, we look to South Carolina case law addressing merger\r\n  clauses and contract interpretation.Â  Munoz, 343 S.C. at 539, 542 S.E.2d\r\n  at 364 (&quot;General contract principles of state law apply to arbitration\r\n  clauses governed by the FAA.&quot;).Â  &quot;Where the contract's language is\r\n  clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contract's force and\r\n  effect.&quot;Â  McGill\r\n    v. Moore,\r\n  381 S.C. 179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574&nbsp;(2009).Â  &quot;The court's duty is\r\n  to enforce the contract made by the parties regardless of its wisdom or folly,\r\n  apparent unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights\r\n  carefully.&quot;Â  Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487,\r\n  488&nbsp;(1994).Â  &quot;The\r\n  court is without authority to consider parties' secret intentions, and\r\n  therefore words cannot be read into a contract to impart an intent unexpressed when\r\n  the contract was executed.&quot;Â  Pee Dee Stores, Inc. v. Doyle, 381\r\n  S.C. 234, 241, 672 S.E.2d 799, 802&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of\r\n  agreements or understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a\r\n  written instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict,\r\n  vary, or explain the written instrument.&quot;Â  Gilliland v. Elmwood Props.,\r\n  301 S.C. 295, 302, 391 S.E.2d 577, 581&nbsp;(1990); see also 11 Samuel\r\n  Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts Â§ 33:1\r\n  (4th ed. 1999) (explaining the parol evidence rule &quot;prohibits the\r\n  admission of extrinsic evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, or\r\n    prior written agreements, to explain the meaning of a contract when the\r\n  parties have reduced their agreement to an unambiguous integrated writing&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  parol evidence rule is particularly applicable where the written instrument\r\n  contains a merger or integration clause.Â  U.S. Leasing Corp. v. Janicare,\r\n    Inc., 294 S.C. 312, 318, 364 S.E.2d 202, 205&nbsp;(Ct.

Landstrom, 281\r\n  S.C. 260, 266, 315 S.E.2d 130, 134 (Ct. App. 1984); see also 11 Samuel\r\n  Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts Â§ 33:21\r\n  (4th ed. 1999) (same); Black's Law Dictionary 880 (9th ed. 2009)\r\n  (defining an integration clause, also termed a merger clause, as &quot;[a]\r\n  contractual provision stating that the contract represents the parties'\r\n  complete and final agreement and supersedes all informal understandings and\r\n  oral agreements relating to the subject matter of the contract&quot;).\r\n&quot;The\r\n  terms of a completely integrated agreement cannot be varied or contradicted by\r\n  parol evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements not included in the\r\n  writing.&quot;Â  Wilson, 281 S.C. at 266, 315 S.E.2d at 134.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  when the writing on its face appears to express the whole agreement, parol\r\n  evidence cannot be admitted to add another term to the agreement, even when the\r\n  writing is silent as to the particular term sought to be established.Â  U.S.\r\n    Leasing Corp., 294 S.C. at 318, 364 S.E.2d at 205; see also Blackwell v.\r\n      Faucett, 117 S.C. 60, 65, 108 S.E. 295, 296 (1921) (noting if the writing on its face\r\n  appears to express the whole agreement, parol evidence cannot be admitted to\r\n  add another term thereto).\r\nBy\r\n  virtue of its express terms, the employment agreement at issue superseded any\r\n  prior agreements.Â  The employment agreement provided: &quot;This letter\r\n  together with the documents referenced herein contain all of the agreements and\r\n  understandings regarding your employment and the obligations of KB Home in\r\n  connection with employment.&quot;Â  Neither the employment application nor the\r\n  arbitration clause contained therein was referenced in the subsequent offer\r\n  letter agreement.Â  The agreement further provided: &quot;This letter supersedes\r\n  any and all prior agreements and understandings between you and KB Home and\r\n  alone expresses the agreement of the parties.&quot;Â  \r\nWe\r\n  conclude the merger clause was clear and unambiguous on its face.[4]Â \r\n  In addition, the employment application at issue was executed two months prior\r\n  to the employment agreement.Â  Therefore, the arbitration clause in the\r\n  application is not admissible to modify or add to the terms of the subsequent\r\n  employment agreement containing a merger clause.Â  See Wilson,\r\n  281 S.C. at 266, 315 S.E.2d at 134; Blackwell, 117 S.C. at 65, 108 S.E.\r\n  at 296.Â  KB\r\n  Home could easily have referenced the arbitration clause contained in the\r\n  employment application in its offer letter agreement, or reproduced identical\r\n  arbitration-clause language in its employment offer agreement.Â  KB Home chose\r\n  not to do so, and this court must enforce the employment agreement according to\r\n  its terms, regardless of its wisdom or folly.Â  See Ellis, 316\r\n  S.C. at 248, 449 S.E.2d at 488 (noting a court must enforce an unambiguous contract\r\n  according to its terms &quot;regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent\r\n  unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights carefully&quot;).Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  cite Ramirez-Baker v. Beazer Homes, Inc., 636 F.Supp.2d 1008&nbsp;(E.D.\r\n  Cal. 2008), to support their argument that a subsequent employment agreement\r\n  does not operate to invalidate a prior arbitration clause.Â  Under California\r\n  law, parol evidence was properly admissible to prove the existence of an arbitration\r\n  clause contained in an employment application when the subsequent employment\r\n  agreement (signed five days later) was silent on the issue of dispute\r\n  resolution.Â  Id. at 1014, 1016-17.Â  This evidence was admissible to\r\n  modify the employment agreement even though the subsequent agreement contained\r\n  a merger clause.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  do not believe South Carolina law supports this conclusion.Â  See Blackwell, 117 S.C. at 65,\r\n  108 S.E. at 296 (observing that if the writing on its face appears to express\r\n  the whole agreement, parol evidence cannot be admitted to add another term,\r\n  even when the agreement contains no language regarding that term); U.S.\r\n    Leasing Corp., 294 S.C. at 318, 364 S.E.2d at 205 (noting when a writing on\r\n  its face appears to express the whole agreement, parol evidence cannot be\r\n  admitted to add another term to the agreement, even when the writing is\r\n    silent as to the particular term sought to be established); Wilson,\r\n  281 S.C. at 266, 315 S.E.2d at 134 (noting that a\r\n  merger clause expresses the parties' intention that the writing be treated as a\r\n  complete integration of their agreement and that a completely integrated\r\n  agreement cannot be varied or contradicted by parol evidence of either a prior\r\n  or a contemporaneous agreement omitted from the writing).\r\nWhile\r\n  we recognize South Carolina law supports a policy favoring arbitration when a\r\n  valid arbitration agreement exists, there is currently no exception to the\r\n  merger clause rule in South Carolina for arbitration clauses in employment\r\n  applications that are superseded by express language in a subsequent employment\r\n  agreement.Â  See Munoz, 343 S.C. at 539, 542 S.E.2d at 364 (&quot;General\r\n  contract principles of state law apply to arbitration clauses governed by the\r\n  FAA.&quot;); see also Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at\r\n  118&nbsp;(&quot;Arbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be\r\n  required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.&quot;).\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the circuit court's finding that the merger clause contained in the\r\n  employment offer letter operated to supersede the arbitration clause contained\r\n  in the employment application.Â  Accordingly, there was no arbitration clause to\r\n  enforce, and the circuit court properly denied the motion to compel\r\n  arbitration.Â  \r\nB. 30-day\r\n  Expiration Clause\r\nAppellants\r\n  next argue that the arbitration clause was separate and distinct from the\r\n  employment application, and therefore the 30-day expiration of the employment\r\n  application did not apply to the arbitration clause contained therein.Â  We need\r\n  not address Appellants' argument regarding the 30-day expiration of the\r\n  employment application because we hold the merger clause was valid and binding.Â \r\n  Therefore, the merger clause served to negate any prior or contemporaneous\r\n  agreements not included in the final document.Â  See U.S. Leasing\r\n    Corp., 294 S.C. at 318, 364 S.E.2d at 205 (noting when a writing on its\r\n  face appears to express the whole agreement, parol evidence cannot be admitted\r\n  to add another term to the agreement, even when the writing is silent as to\r\n    the particular term sought to be established); see also Futch v.\r\n      McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598&nbsp;(1999) (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues on appeal when\r\n  the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nII.&nbsp; Waiver\r\nAppellants\r\n  further argue the circuit court erred in finding they waived their right to enforce\r\n  the arbitration clause by engaging in litigation for an eighteen-month period\r\n  prior to filing a motion to compel arbitration.Â  Specifically, Appellants argue\r\n  Davis cannot demonstrate any prejudice from the delay, and mere inconvenience\r\n  is insufficient to demonstrate prejudice.Â  We disagree, and we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's ruling on this alternative basis.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  right to enforce an arbitration clause may be waived.Â  Liberty Builders, Inc.\r\n    v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 665, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999).Â \r\n  &quot;In order to establish waiver, a party must show prejudice through an\r\n  undue burden caused by delay in demanding arbitration.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;There is no set rule as to what constitutes a waiver of the right to\r\n  arbitrate; the question depends on the facts of each case.&quot;Â  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  \r\nIn Rhodes v. Benson Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., this court set out three factors\r\n  a court generally considers when determining whether a party has waived its\r\n  right to compel arbitration: &quot;(1) whether a substantial length of time\r\n  transpired between the commencement of the action and the commencement of the\r\n  motion to compel arbitration; (2) whether the party requesting arbitration\r\n  engaged in extensive discovery before moving to compel arbitration; and (3)\r\n  whether the non-moving party was prejudiced by the delay in seeking\r\n  arbitration.&quot;Â  374 S.C. 122, 126, 647 S.E.2d 249, 251&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  &quot;To establish prejudice, the non-moving party must show something\r\n  more than mere inconvenience.&quot; Id. at 127, 647 S.E.2d at\r\n  251&nbsp;(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  first address whether a substantial length of time has passed between\r\n  commencement of the action and the motion to compel arbitration.Â  South\r\n  Carolina case law varies with respect to what constitutes a &quot;substantial\r\n  length of time.&quot;Â  Compare Evans v. Accent Manufactured Homes,\r\n    Inc., 352 S.C. 544, 548, 575 S.E.2d 74, 75-76 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding a\r\n  nineteen-month period in which the parties exchanged\r\n  written interrogatories and requests to produce and the party requesting\r\n  arbitration took two depositions demonstrated waiver), and Rhodes,\r\n  374 S.C. at 125, 128, 647 S.E.2d at 250, 252 (finding a ten-month period in\r\n  which parties exchanged written interrogatories and requests to produce and\r\n  took five depositions was sufficient to demonstrate waiver), with Toler's\r\n    Cove Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. Trident Constr. Co., 355 S.C. 605, 612, 586\r\n  S.E.2d 581, 585 (2003) (finding a thirteen-month period in which discovery was\r\n  limited in nature, the parties had not availed themselves of the court's\r\n  assistance, and respondent had not held any depositions did not demonstrate\r\n  waiver), and Gen. Equip. &amp; Supply Co. v. Keller Rigging &amp;\r\n    Constr., Inc., 344 S.C. 553, 557, 544 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding\r\n  an eight-month period where the &quot;litigation consisted of routine\r\n  administrative matters and limited discovery [that] did not involve the taking\r\n  of depositions or extensive interrogatories&quot; did not establish waiver).\r\nWe\r\n  conclude a substantial length of time has passed in the instant matter.Â  Appellants\r\n  waited eighteen months after Davis filed his complaint to file their motion to\r\n  compel arbitration and stay proceedings.Â  No other South Carolina case has\r\n  found that a party did not waive their rights to compel arbitration after a\r\n  year and a half of litigation.Â  \r\nRegarding\r\n  the second factor, we further conclude the parties have engaged in extensive\r\n  discovery.Â  Both Davis and Appellants produced documents and filed responses to\r\n  the opposing parties' interrogatories.Â  Appellants noticed and rescheduled\r\n  Davis's deposition on five separate occasions.Â  Davis filed a motion to compel\r\n  discovery on July 13, 2009.Â  Appellants filed a memorandum in response to\r\n  Davis's motion to compel discovery on August 5, 2009.Â  All of the\r\n  foregoing actions forced Davis to incur attorney's fees that would not have\r\n  been expended in arbitration.Â  Under the facts of this case, we hold Davis was\r\n  prejudiced by the costs he incurred in discovery.Â  See Evans, 352\r\n  S.C. at 551, 575 S.E.2d at 77 (holding defendant's continuation of discovery,\r\n  rather than seeking arbitration in a timely manner, prejudiced plaintiff by\r\n  forcing her to incur discovery costs that would not have been expended in\r\n  arbitration).Â  \r\nLastly,\r\n  we note the parties have availed themselves of the circuit court's assistance\r\n  on several occasions.Â  Appellants\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss, which the circuit court heard and denied via a Form\r\n  4 judgment on January 9, 2009.Â  Appellants filed a motion for entry of a\r\n  confidentiality order with respect to Davis's discovery requests on July 28,\r\n  2009.Â  An initial scheduling order was signed by the circuit court on April 30,\r\n  2009.Â  Finally, the parties consented to an amended scheduling order, which was\r\n  signed by the Chief Administrative Circuit Court Judge on August 7, 2009.Â  Pursuant to the\r\n  terms of the amended scheduling order, this case was subject to being called\r\n  for trial on or after February 15, 2010.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if the arbitration clause in Davis's employment application had been valid and\r\n  binding, we affirm the circuit court's denial of Appellants' motion to compel\r\n  arbitration on the alternative basis that Appellants waived their right to enforce\r\n  the arbitration agreement.Â  Although the parties have not taken any\r\n  depositions, a substantial length of time has passed, the parties have engaged\r\n  in extensive discovery, and the parties have availed themselves of the circuit\r\n  court's assistance on several occasions.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Unconscionable\r\n  Contract of Adhesion\r\nFinally,\r\n  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in finding the arbitration agreement\r\n  was an unconscionable contract of adhesion.Â  Because we hold the merger clause\r\n  in the employment agreement nullified the existence of the arbitration clause\r\n  contained in the employment application, we need not reach the merits of this\r\n  issue.Â  Futch, 335 S.C. at\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d at 598 (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues on appeal when\r\n  the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  all of the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Jeff Meyer was\r\n  the immediate supervisor of Lonnie Davis, the plaintiff in this action.\r\n[2]Â  Davis's\r\n  Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Stay and Refer to Arbitration was\r\n  included as part of the Record on Appeal.Â  Â \r\n[3] Â During oral\r\n  argument, Appellants\r\n  contended this court is bound to reviewing the terms of the arbitration clause\r\n  itself in determining its validity.Â  We disagree.Â  The South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court has looked outside the language of the arbitration clause to determine\r\n  its enforceability.Â  See Simpson, 373 S.C. at 27, 644 S.E.2d at\r\n  670 (noting the arbitration clause was unconscionable partly because Simpson\r\n  did not possess the business judgment necessary to understand the implications\r\n  of the arbitration agreement, and Simpson did not have a lawyer present when\r\n  she signed the agreement).Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n[4]Â  Even if this\r\n  court were to view the merger clause as ambiguous, any ambiguity must be\r\n  construed against the drafter of the contract, in this case KB Home.Â  See Chassereau v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 175, 644 S.E.2d 718,\r\n  722 (2007) (â€œ[A] court will construe any doubts and ambiguities in an agreement\r\n  against the drafter of the agreement.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4852","title":"Stiltner v.

Â The Stiltners appeal.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSince\r\n  1990 or 1991, Mr. Stiltner has had his vehicles insured by USAA.Â  After Mr.\r\n  and Mrs. Stiltner married in 1998, Mr. Stiltner added Mrs. Stiltner to his\r\n  policy as an operator.Â  At some point, he raised his limits to\r\n  100,000/300,000/50,000.Â  At no time before the Stiltners sued USAA has Mr.\r\n  Stiltner ever had UIM coverage on his policy.\r\nIn\r\n  2000, USAA mailed Mr. Stiltner offer forms for uninsured motorist coverage (UM coverage)\r\n  and UIM coverage.Â  On October 17, 2000, both forms were faxed to USAA from Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner's place of employment.Â  The form offering UM coverage had handwritten\r\n  &quot;x's&quot; indicating various selected limits of UM coverage, but also had\r\n  a handwritten checkmark indicating a rejection of the offer to purchase UM\r\n  coverage.Â  Similarly, the form for UIM coverage had &quot;x&quot; marks\r\n  indicating selected limits of UIM coverage, but also a checkmark indicating a\r\n  rejection of the offer to purchase UIM coverage.Â  Both forms bore what appeared\r\n  to be the signature of Mrs. Stiltner.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Richard Kennedy, a senior underwriter at USAA, the completed forms the\r\n  Stiltners returned to USAA were internally inconsistent and a USAA member\r\n  service representative who handled South Carolina insureds would have contacted\r\n  them to discuss the discrepancy.Â  Two days later, a form for UM coverage was\r\n  faxed to USAA from Mrs. Stiltner's place of employment.Â  This form bore\r\n  the same &quot;x&quot; marks selecting limits for UM coverage, but also had a\r\n  checkmark in the space indicating acceptance of UM coverage.Â  On the same day,\r\n  a form for UIM coverageâ€”in fact, the same form faxed to USAA two days agoâ€”was\r\n  faxed to USAA from Mrs. Stiltner's place of employment.Â  This form, however,\r\n  was altered to remove the &quot;x&quot; marks indicating selected limits for\r\n  UIM coverage, but retained the checkmark indicating purchase of UIM coverage\r\n  was rejected.Â  Although neither Mr. nor Mrs. Stiltner specifically recalled\r\n  receiving the UIM offer form, neither disputed that it was Mrs. Stiltner's\r\n  signature on the form indicating both a rejection of UIM coverage and an\r\n  acknowledgement of the offer. \r\nMr.\r\n  Stiltner generally handled the couple's insurance matters; however, Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner was authorized to handle such matters provided she made no unilateral\r\n  changes in the policy and communicated with Mr. Stiltner before taking any\r\n  action.Â  In her deposition, Mrs. Stiltner testified that, if she had handled a\r\n  matter concerning Mr. Stiltner's insurance policy, she &quot;would have just\r\n  kept things the way they were, the way he had it before&quot; and would not\r\n  have signed a document for the policy without Mr. Stiltner's permission.Â  Mr.\r\n  Stiltner, however, maintained he never asked Mrs. Stiltner to sign any USAA\r\n  forms or discussed with her the various types of coverage on his USAA\r\n  automobile insurance policy. \r\nIn\r\n  March 2007, the Stiltners were both seriously injured when another driver\r\n  failed to yield the right of way and drove into the path of their motorcycle.Â \r\n  Their combined medical expenses approached $500,000, and neither had completed\r\n  treatment at the time of the hearing in the present matter.Â  The at-fault\r\n  driver was covered by an insurance policy with liability limits of only $25,000\r\n  per person and $50,000 per occurrence. Â The Stiltners accepted the at-fault\r\n  driver's liability limits in exchange for a covenant not to execute judgment,\r\n  allowing them to pursue other available insurance coverage.\r\nThe\r\n  Stiltners then brought the present action against USAA, seeking a declaratory\r\n  judgment that (1) USAA did not make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, (2) Mr.\r\n  Stiltner's policy should be reformed to include UIM coverage with limits equal\r\n  to his liability limits of 100,000/300,000/50,000, (3) the Stiltners were both\r\n  Class I insureds, and (4) the Stiltners could stack UIM coverage to fully\r\n  compensate them for their injuries.\r\nUSAA\r\n  filed a general denial and moved for summary judgment after the parties\r\n  completed discovery.Â  In support of its motion, USAA asserted (1) Mrs. Stiltner\r\n  had signed a form rejecting UIM coverage, (2) USAA had made a meaningful offer\r\n  of UIM coverage, (3) Mrs. Stiltner acted as Mr. Stiltner's agent when she\r\n  signed the form rejecting UIM coverage, and (4) it would be inequitable for\r\n  Mrs. Stiltner to escape the effect of her own selection.\r\nThe\r\n  Stiltners then filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing among other\r\n  things, the rejection form allegedly signed by Mrs. Stiltner was not a valid\r\n  rejection of UIM coverage.Â  The trial court conducted a hearing on the\r\n  cross-motions and later issued an order granting summary judgment to USAA and\r\n  denying summary judgment to the Stiltners.Â  The Stiltners then filed their\r\n  notice of appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.Â  Did the trial court\r\n  err in finding Mrs. Stiltner had the authority to act as Mr. Stiltner's agent\r\n  when she signed the form rejecting UIM coverage on his policy?\r\nII. If Mrs. Stiltner had\r\n  the authority to take action on Mr. Stiltner's insurance policy, is there a\r\n  reasonable dispute as to whether she was acting within the scope of that\r\n  authority?\r\nIII.Â  Should this court\r\n  uphold the grant of summary judgment on the ground that Mr. Stiltner, in\r\n  failing to take any corrective action after receiving policy declarations and\r\n  renewal notices for a period of over six years, ratified Mrs. Stiltner's\r\n  rejection of UIM coverage?\r\nIV.Â Â  Should this court\r\n  uphold summary judgment as to Mrs. Stiltner on the ground that she should be\r\n  estopped from denying her own rejection of coverage?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In reviewing the\r\n  grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&quot;Â  Boyd\r\n    v. Bellsouth Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410, 415, 633 S.E.2d 136, 138\r\n  (2006).Â  &quot;Under Rule 56, SCRCP, a party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;In determining\r\n  whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, the\r\n  evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;[I]n cases applying a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the\r\n  non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in\r\n  order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v.\r\n    Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Whether Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner had authority to reject UIM coverage on behalf of Mr. Stiltner\r\nThe Stiltners first argue the\r\n  trial court erred in concluding that Mrs. Stitlner had authority to transact\r\n  matters under Mrs. Stiltner's automobile policy as long as she discussed them\r\n  with Mr. Stiltner in advance and did not make any changes to the policy.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;The relationship of\r\n  agency between a husband and wife is governed by the same rules which apply to\r\n  other agencies[,] . . . [and] no presumption arises from the mere fact of the\r\n  marital relationship.&quot;Â  Bankers Trust of S.C. v. Bruce, 283 S.C.\r\n  408, 423, 323 S.E.2d 523, 532 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Under such rules, &quot;the\r\n  relationship of agency need not depend upon express appointment and acceptance\r\n  thereof.Â  Rather, the agency relationship may be, and frequently is, implied or\r\n  inferred from the words and conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the\r\n  particular case.&quot;Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Prioleau, 359 S.C.\r\n  238, 242, 597 S.E.2d 165, 168 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court noted Mr.\r\n  Stiltner, during his deposition, &quot;confirmed [Mrs. Stiltner] had authority\r\n  to transact matters under his automobile insurance policy as long as she did\r\n  not make any changes or left things as they were&quot;; however, the court\r\n  further noted Mr. Stiltner &quot;also indicated that she was to discuss any\r\n  matters with him before she handled it.&quot;Â  According to this testimony and\r\n  the trial court's ruling, Mrs. Stiltner could have rejected UIM coverage on Mr.\r\n  Stiltner's behalf if she had discussed it with him before doing so.Â  The\r\n  Stiltners do not dispute that Mrs. Stiltner had authority to sign insurance\r\n  documents for Mr. Stiltner, provided these prerequisites were met. Â In her\r\n  deposition, Mrs. Stiltner testified she would not have signed a document for\r\n  Mr. Stiltner's automobile policy without discussing it with him first or\r\n  without him knowing anything about it.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the Stiltners, then, we agree with the trial court that Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner had the implied authority to act on Mr. Stiltner's behalf regarding\r\n  his automobile insurance coverage provided her actions did not change his\r\n  existing coverage and she consulted Mr. Stiltner before she acted. \r\nII.Â  Whether Mrs. Stiltner\r\n  was acting within the scope of her authority\r\nThe Stiltners argue that if\r\n  Mrs. Stiltner had any authority to take action on Mr. Stiltner's automobile\r\n  insurance policy, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to\r\n  them, there remains a reasonable factual dispute as to whether Mrs. Stiltner\r\n  was acting within the scope of her authority.Â  We agree.\r\nIn finding that Mrs. Stiltner\r\n  was acting within her authority when she signed the form rejecting UIM\r\n  coverage, the trial court relied on (1) Mr. Stiltner's statement that Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner had authority to transact matters under his automobile insurance\r\n  policy as long as she did not make any changes and discussed them with him in\r\n  advance and (2) Mrs. Stiltner's statements during her deposition that\r\n  she would not have signed a document for the insurance policy without Mr.\r\n  Stiltner's permission or contrary to his instructions.Â  Based on these\r\n  statements, the court reasoned that Mrs. Stiltner's signature indicating a\r\n  rejection of UIM coverage was conclusive proof that she discussed the matter\r\n  with Mr. Stiltner before signing the form.Â  What the court overlooked, however,\r\n  was Mr. Stiltner's testimony that he did not discuss any such form with his\r\n  wife.Â  Such testimony, if believed by a jury, would support a finding that,\r\n  notwithstanding the Stiltners' usual practice of discussing insurance matters\r\n  before signing the corresponding forms, Mrs. Stiltner was not acting within the\r\n  scope of her authority when she signed the form rejecting UIM coverage.Â  This evidence,\r\n  then, would be at least a scintilla of evidence precluding summary judgment.Â  See Hancock, 381 S.C. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d at 803 (clarifying that\r\n  &quot;more than a scintilla of evidence&quot; is necessary &quot;to withstand a\r\n  motion for summary judgment&quot; only &quot;in cases requiring a heightened\r\n  burden of proof or in cases applying federal law&quot;).\r\nIII.Â Â Ratification\r\nUSAA argues that even if Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner was not acting within her authority as Mr. Stiltner's agent when she\r\n  rejected UIM coverage, Mr. Stiltner ratified her actions when he failed to take\r\n  corrective action after receiving policy declarations and renewal notices for a\r\n  period of over six years that showed he did not have UIM coverage.Â  We hold it\r\n  would be premature for this court to affirm the grant of summary judgment based\r\n  on this ground.Â  \r\nThe possibility that an\r\n  insured can ratify another's rejection of UIM coverage on behalf of the insured\r\n  has been recognized in at least one reported decision.Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins.\r\n    Co. v. Powell, 292 F.3d 201, 205 (4th Cir. 2002).Â  One asserting\r\n  ratification must establish the following three elements:Â  (1) acceptance by\r\n  the principal of the benefits of the agent's acts, (2) the principal's full\r\n  knowledge of the facts, and (3) circumstances or an affirmative election\r\n  demonstrating the principal's intent to accept the unauthorized arrangements.Â  Lincoln\r\n    v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 300 S.C. 188, 191, 386 S.E.2d 801, 803 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1989).Â  Absent an admission by the insured that he or she has ratified a\r\n  rejection of UIM coverage, &quot;[w]hether or not there has been a ratification\r\n  of an unauthorized act by acceptance or retention of benefits thereof is\r\n  usually a question of fact for the jury and not one of law for the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Fuller v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 86,\r\n  124 S.E.2d 602, 608 (1962). Â Moreover, &quot;mere silence or failure of a\r\n  principal to repudiate the unauthorized act of an agent does not necessarily constitute\r\n  a ratification, unless the silence or acquiescence in question cannot be\r\n  explained on any other theory than that of ratification.&quot;Â  2A C.J.S. Agency Â§ 71 (2003).Â  \r\nHere, Mr. Stiltner presented\r\n  evidence that he did not understand the difference between UM coverage and UIM\r\n  coverage until he and Mrs. Stiltner were involved in the accident that led to\r\n  this lawsuit and, until that time, assumed he had what he needed to be\r\n  &quot;well-covered.&quot;Â  Furthermore, there was evidence that he was unaware\r\n  that Mrs. Stiltner had purported to reject UIM coverage on his behalf.Â  Â Â We\r\n  therefore hold that factual issues remain as to whether USAA can assert\r\n  ratification as a defense to the Stiltner's request for reformation of their\r\n  policy.Â  See Restatement (Third) of Agency, Â§ 4.06 cmt. b (2006)\r\n  (stating ratification requires that the principal have actual knowledge of the\r\n  relevant material facts). \r\nIV.Â Estoppel as to Mrs. Stiltner\r\nUSAA further maintains that\r\n  even if the policy is reformed, Mrs. Stiltner should have been estopped from\r\n  denying her own rejection of UIM coverage.Â  USAA contends that agency\r\n  principles support this reasoning.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn support of its argument for estoppel, USAA cites Bonnette v.\r\n  Robles, 740 So. 2d 261, 263 (La. Ct. App. 1999), in which a wife who had\r\n  signed a form opting for a lower level of UM coverage than what she could have\r\n  selected was held to &quot;be estopped to deny the validity of her legal\r\n  representative capacity for purposes of increasing her own UM benefits limits\r\n  when she plainly would have represented to the insurer, by signing the\r\n  documents, that she had the legal authority to sign as [her husband's]\r\n  representative.&quot;Â  That decision, however, was based on a statutory\r\n  provision allowing for such action by either &quot;the named insured or his\r\n  legal representative.&quot;Â  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 22:1295 (2009) (formerly La.\r\n  Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 22:1406).Â  In contrast, the South Carolina provision on\r\n  &quot;knowing selection of coverage,&quot; does not reference the possibility\r\n  of a legal representative acting on behalf of an insured in rejecting UIM\r\n  coverage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (2002).\r\nA party claiming estoppel\r\n  must show, among other things, reasonable reliance on the conduct of the party\r\n  to be estopped.Â  Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317\r\n  S.C. 471, 477, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  This is consistent with the\r\n  following comments from the Restatement (Third) of Agency:\r\n\r\n  Whether\r\n    a person makes an implied representation of authority is a question of fact to\r\n    be determined by inferences to be drawn from the person's conduct. . . . It is\r\n    a question of fact whether the manner in which the purported agent made the\r\n    statement was effective as a manifestation made to the third party.Â  \r\n\r\nRestatement (Third) of Agency Â§ 6.10 cmt. c (2006).Â  Thus far, we have determined that\r\n  the question of whether Mrs. Stiltner was acting within the scope of her\r\n  authority when she signed the form rejecting UIM coverage on behalf of her\r\n  husband could not be decided as a matter of law based on the evidence presented\r\n  at the summary judgment hearing.Â  Furthermore, USAA has not presented any evidenceâ€”such as a prior course of dealing\r\n  between the partiesâ€”that would establish reasonable reliance on its part as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  We therefore hold USAA was not\r\n  entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether Mrs. Stiltner's rejection\r\n  of UIM coverage should be binding on her.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe agree with the trial\r\n  court that Mrs. Stiltner had the implied authority to transact matters\r\n  concerning Mr. Stiltner's automobile insurance coverage provided her actions\r\n  did not change Mr. Stiltner's existing coverage and she consulted with Mr.\r\n  Stiltner before acting.Â  We further hold, however, that there is a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact as to whether Mrs. Stiltner acted within her scope of\r\n  authority when she rejected UIM coverage on Mr. Stiltner's insurance policy and\r\n  remand this matter for a trial on the merits.Â  We reject USAA's arguments that\r\n  it is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of ratification and that Mrs.\r\n  Stiltner should be estopped from denying rejection of UIM coverage on her own\r\n  behalf.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART,\r\n  REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4853","title":"Langdale v.

Â Harris Carpets and\r\n  Gevity each responded with a Form 51 denying coverage. Â Harris Carpets denied\r\n  coverage, averring Langdale was a statutory employee of Gevity. Â Gevity denied\r\n  coverage, asserting Langdale was not a covered employee of Harris Carpets. \r\nAfter a hearing on October 23, 2008, the single commissioner found\r\n  Langdale's injury compensable and issued an order finding, inter alia,\r\n  the following: (1) Langdale was an independent contractor; (2) Harris Carpets\r\n  deducted ten percent of Langdale's pay for the purchase of workers'\r\n  compensation insurance; (3) Harris Carpets' manager testified he advised Gevity\r\n  that Langdale was to be covered; (4) both Gevity and Harris Carpets were\r\n  estopped from denying coverage as a matter of equity; (5) Harris Carpets was\r\n  acting as an agent of Gevity by withholding workers' compensation premiums from\r\n  Langdale's paycheck; and (6) Gevity and Harris Carpets both failed to meet\r\n  their obligations under the Agreement.Â  In addition, the single commissioner\r\n  awarded medical and temporary total benefits commencing on March 13, 2008 to Langdale.Â Â  \r\nGevity\r\n  appealed to the Appellate Panel, which affirmed the findings of the single\r\n  commissioner.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  substantial evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures Act governs the\r\n  standard of review in a workers' compensation decision.

Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence,\r\n  nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence\r\n  which, considering the record as a whole, would\r\n  allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency\r\n  reached in order to justify its action.&quot; Â Id. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at\r\n  300.Â  &quot;The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the\r\n  evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's findings from being\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.&quot; Â Id. at 620, 611 S.E.2d at 301.Â  \r\nWhere\r\n  the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate\r\n  Panel are conclusive.

Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d\r\n  551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agency\r\n  Relationship\r\nGevity\r\n  asserts the Appellate Panel erred in finding Harris Carpets acted as an agent\r\n  for Gevity when Harris Carpets withheld premiums from Langdale's paycheck.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  existence of an agency relationship is a question of fact to be determined by\r\n  the relation, the situation, the conduct, and the declarations of the party\r\n  sought to be charged as principal. Â Am. Fed. Bank, FSB v. No. One Main Joint\r\n    Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 173-74, 467 S.E.2d 439, 442 (1996); Hinson v.\r\n      Roof, 128 S.C. 470, 474, 122 S.E. 488, 489 (1924).Â  Agency may be implied\r\n  or inferred and may be proved circumstantially by the conduct of the purported\r\n  agent exhibiting a pretense of authority with the knowledge of the alleged\r\n  principal. Â R &amp; G Const., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343\r\n  S.C. 424, 434, 540 S.E.2d 113, 118&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (citing Fernander v.\r\n    Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 143, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982)). \r\nGevity\r\n  avers the Appellate Panel erred in finding the existence of an agency\r\n  relationship because Gevity and Harris Carpets never agreed to enter into an\r\n  agency relationship.Â  The Agreement signed by the parties contained a provision\r\n  prohibiting either party from acting as the agent of the other party unless\r\n  specifically authorized to do so in writing.[2]Â \r\n  The single commissioner and Appellate Panel found Harris Carpets was acting as\r\n  an agent of Gevity by withholding workers' compensation premiums from Langdale's\r\n  checks despite the provision in the parties' Agreement prohibiting an agency\r\n  relationship.Â  See Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Myrtle Beach Golf\r\n    &amp; Yacht Club, 310 S.C. 132, 145-46, 425 S.E.2d 764, 773 (Ct. App. 1992)\r\n  (&quot;An agreement may result in the creation of an agency relationship\r\n  although the parties did not call it an agency and did not intend the\r\n  consequences of the relationship to follow.&quot;).Â  \r\nGevity\r\n  asserts the Agreement did not authorize Harris Carpets to withhold workers'\r\n  compensation premiums on its behalf.Â  Despite this contention, the evidence proves\r\n  Harris Carpets performed duties on behalf of Gevity when Harris Carpets\r\n  deducted money from its employees and contractors to pay Gevity.Â  In return, Gevity\r\n  acted on Harris Carpets' behalf when Gevity provided workers' compensation\r\n  insurance to Harris Carpets' workers. Â See Bankers Trust of S.C. v.\r\n    Bruce, 283 S.C. 408, 423, 323 S.E.2d 523, 532 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (&quot;Generally, agency may be, and frequently is, implied or inferred from\r\n  the words and conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the\r\n  particular case.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  Even though the Agreement did not explicitly\r\n  establish an agency relationship, we find these actions by Harris Carpets and\r\n  Gevity amount to a binding agency relationship. Â See Beasley v. Kerr\r\n    McGee Chem. Corp., 273 S.C. 523, 526, 257 S.E.2d 726, 727 (1979) (&quot;It\r\n  is well established that the terms of a contractual agreement are not\r\n  conclusive in determining the association between two parties where there is\r\n  evidence outside the contract establishing an agency relationship.&quot;).Â  As\r\n  the existence of an agency relationship is a question of fact, and this court may\r\n  not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of\r\n  the evidence on questions of fact, we find the single commissioner and\r\n  Appellate Panel's findings are supported by substantial evidence. Â See Stone,\r\n  360 S.C. at 274, 600 S.E.2d at 552 (&quot;In an appeal from the [Appellate Panel],\r\n  neither this court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that\r\n  of the [Appellate Panel] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact,\r\n  but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;). \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Langdale's\r\n  Coverage under Harris Carpets' Insurance Policy \r\nGevity\r\n  asserts the Appellate Panel erred in finding the manager of Harris Carpets\r\n  advised Gevity that Langdale was to be covered under its workers' compensation\r\n  policy.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn\r\n  a workers' compensation case, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder.Â  DeBruhl v. Kershaw Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't., 303 S.C. 20, 24, 397 S.E.2d\r\n  782, 785 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and\r\n  the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel and it is\r\n  not the task of courts to weigh the evidence as found by the single commissioner.\r\n  Â Id.Â  Where there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue,\r\n  the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive. Â See Stokes v.\r\n    First Nat'l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1991) (finding regardless\r\n  of a conflict in the evidence, either of different witnesses or of the same witness, a\r\n  finding of fact by the Appellate Panel is conclusive). \r\nA\r\n  review of the record reveals conflicting evidence exists as to whether Scott\r\n  Junkins, the manager of Harris Carpets, informed Gevity that Langdale was\r\n  covered under its workers' compensation policy.Â  At the hearing, Mr. Junkins\r\n  initially testified his office manager provided the list of Harris Carpets' covered\r\n  employees to Gevity.Â  When questioned by the single commissioner, however, Mr.\r\n  Junkins stated that, to the best of his knowledge, neither he nor anybody in\r\n  his company specifically notified Gevity that Langdale was to be covered. Â Shortly\r\n  after this exchange, Mr. Junkins testified on cross-examination he told Gevity\r\n  about Langdale and Langdale's desire for coverage during the parties' initial\r\n  meeting in August 2007.Â  Despite this conflict in Mr. Junkins' testimony, the\r\n  single commissioner concluded Harris Carpets advised Gevity that Langdale was\r\n  to be covered, which we defer to on appeal. Â See Sharpe v. Case\r\n    Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999) (stating the\r\n  final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded\r\n  evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel and it is not the task of this\r\n  court to weigh the evidence).Â  Accordingly, we find substantial evidence in the\r\n  record to support the findings of the single commissioner and the Appellate Panel\r\n  on this issue.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gevity's\r\n  Liability for Langdale's Workers' Compensation Coverage\r\nGevity\r\n  contends the Appellate Panel erred in finding liability should be placed on Gevity\r\n  as opposed to Harris Carpets and/or the Uninsured Employer's Fund to provide\r\n  workers' compensation coverage for Langdale.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  court's review is limited to determining whether the Appellate Panel's decision\r\n  is unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Corbin\r\n    v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Our\r\n  review of the record finds the Appellate Panel's decision is supported by\r\n  substantial evidence and there is no error of law.Â  Gevity admits five months\r\n  prior to Langdale's injury, Harris Carpets contracted with Gevity to manage\r\n  paperwork, provide consulting services, and provide workers' compensation coverage\r\n  through Gevity's workers' compensation insurer.Â  After contracting to undertake\r\n  these responsibilities in August 2007, representatives of Gevity met with\r\n  Harris Carpets, and the parties determined who was to be covered under the\r\n  workers' compensation insurance policy.Â  As noted above, the single\r\n  commissioner and Appellate Panel found Harris Carpets informed Gevity that Langdale\r\n  was a covered employee.Â  In addition, by withholding premiums from Langdale's\r\n  check, Harris Carpets served as an agent of Gevity thereby requiring Gevity to provide\r\n  workers' compensation for Harris Carpets' workers.Â  Because Harris Carpets was\r\n  insured by Gevity at the time of Langdale's accident, Gevity must provide\r\n  coverage for Langdale's accident. Â Accordingly, we find substantial evidence in\r\n  this record to support the findings of the single commissioner and the\r\n  Appellate Panel that Gevity is responsible for providing workers' compensation\r\n  coverage for Langdale.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Estoppel as a Matter\r\n  of Equity\r\nGevity\r\n  argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding Gevity failed to fulfill its\r\n  obligations under the Agreement and in finding Gevity and Harris Carpets are\r\n  estopped from denying workers' compensation coverage as a matter of equity.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  essential elements of estoppel as related to the party estopped are: (1)\r\n  conduct which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material\r\n  facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the\r\n  facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party\r\n  subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intention, or at least expectation, that\r\n  such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual\r\n  or constructive, of the real facts. Â S. Dev. Land &amp; Golf Co., v. S.C.\r\n    Pub. Serv. Auth.,\r\n  311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750&nbsp;(1993) (citing Frady v. Smith,\r\n  247 S.C. 353, 359, 147 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1966), overruled on other grounds by Tolemac, Inc. v. United Trading, Inc., 326 S.C. 103, 484 S.E.2d 593\r\n  (1997)).Â  To successfully assert the doctrine of estoppel, a party must show a (1)\r\n  lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in\r\n  question, (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped, and (3)\r\n  prejudicial change in position.Â  See S. Dev. Land &amp; Golf Co.,\r\n  311 S.C. at 33, 426 S.E.2d at 750.Â  \r\nHarris\r\n  Carpets' actions meet the essential elements of estoppel.Â  First, Harris\r\n  Carpets falsely represented to Langdale he was a covered employee under its workers'\r\n  compensation insurance policy when Harris Carpets continued to deduct ten\r\n  percent from each of Langdale's paychecks. Â Second, Harris Carpets had the\r\n  expectation Langdale would rely on coverage when Harris Carpets offered\r\n  Langdale the opportunity to sign a waiver to decline workers' compensation\r\n  insurance, but Langdale refused, wanting to be covered under Harris Carpets'\r\n  policy.Â  Finally, Harris Carpets had constructive knowledge Langdale would not\r\n  have been covered under its workers' compensation policy when Mr. Junkins\r\n  admitted he did not read the Agreement even though he signed it.Â  See Shenker\r\n    v. Baltimore &amp; O. R., 374 U.S. 1, 13 (1963) (stating that implicit in\r\n  the principle of constructive knowledge is that one is chargeable with knowledge\r\n  of that which in the exercise of reasonable care he should have known).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  Harris Carpets' conduct meets the essential elements of estoppel. \r\nGevity's\r\n  actions also meet the essential elements of estoppel.Â  First, Gevity falsely\r\n  represents a position inconsistent with its subsequent conduct.Â  Gevity\r\n  maintains Langdale is not covered because Harris Carpets and Langdale did not\r\n  adhere to the provisions of the Agreement by failing to provide form &quot;GNL\r\n  GL-800,&quot; a document which is to be completed by the client and the worker to\r\n  initiate coverage.Â  Although Langdale and Harris Carpets never filled out form\r\n  &quot;GNL GL-800,&quot; Mr. Junkins testified Gevity never provided Harris\r\n  Carpets with this form.Â  Moreover, oral argument before the Appellate Panel\r\n  revealed Harris Carpets provided Gevity a list of employees, and none of these\r\n  employees were required to submit form &quot;GNL GL-800,&quot; but obtained\r\n  coverage.Â  Second, Gevity also had the intention, or at least expectation, that\r\n  employees paying workers' compensation premiums would be relying upon coverage\r\n  should they be injured.Â  Finally, Gevity had constructive knowledge of the real\r\n  facts.Â  Gevity asserts it was never provided notice Langdale was to be a\r\n  covered employee because form &quot;GNL GL-800&quot; was never submitted.Â \r\n  Despite this contention, Gevity had the ability to audit Harris Carpets pursuant\r\n  to the parties' Agreement, which would have revealed the employees covered\r\n  under the policy.Â  Although Gevity was not required to perform an audit, it had\r\n  five months to review Harris Carpets' financial records, which would have\r\n  likely revealed Langdale's workers' compensation premiums were not being paid\r\n  to Gevity. Â See Shenker, 374 U.S. at 13 (stating that implicit in\r\n  the principle of constructive knowledge is that one is chargeable with\r\n  knowledge of that which in the exercise of reasonable care he should have\r\n  known).Â  As a result, Gevity's actions meet the essential elements of estoppel.\r\nLangdale\r\n  satisfies the essential elements of the doctrine of estoppel.Â  First, the\r\n  record provides ample evidence Langdale had no knowledge of Harris Carpets' or\r\n  Gevity's actions.Â  At the hearing, Langdale and Mr. Junkins both stated Harris\r\n  Carpets made representations Langdale was covered under its workers'\r\n  compensation policy.Â  Langdale had no way of knowing the truth as to the facts\r\n  in question as he continued to pay ten percent of each paycheck for workers'\r\n  compensation insurance and did not know Gevity had an agreement with Harris\r\n  Carpets or that Gevity even existed.Â  Second, it is undisputed Langdale relied\r\n  upon these representations of coverage.Â  Finally, by declining the waiver of\r\n  workers' compensation he was initially offered, Langdale changed his position\r\n  in relying upon coverage when he agreed to have ten percent deducted from each\r\n  paycheck.Â  Accordingly, we find the decision by the Appellate Panel estopping\r\n  both Gevity and Harris Carpets from denying coverage is supported by reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence in the record. \r\nE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporary\r\n  Total Disability Benefits\r\nGevity\r\n  and Harris Carpets assert the Appellate Panel erred in finding Langdale is currently\r\n  entitled to temporary total disability benefits.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nSection\r\n  42-1-120 of the South Carolina Code (2010) defines disability as the &quot;incapacity\r\n  because of injury to earn the wages which an employee was receiving at the time\r\n  of the injury in the same or some other employment.&quot;Â  The issue of the\r\n  extent of disability is a question of fact to be proved as any other fact is\r\n  proved. Â Arnold v. Benjamin Booth Co., 257 S.C. 337, 342, 185 S.E.2d 830,\r\n  832 (1971).Â  &quot;This court's function is not to resolve conflicts in the\r\n  evidence but to determine from the record if substantial evidence supports the\r\n  agency's finding.&quot;Â  Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 384,\r\n  335 S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\nGevity\r\n  and Harris Carpets aver Langdale should have returned to work six to eight\r\n  weeks following his surgery, and therefore, Langdale's temporary total\r\n  disability benefits were proper only until October 3, 2008.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Gevity and Harris Carpets argue there is no medical evidence on which the\r\n  single commissioner based his finding and Langdale is an experienced,\r\n  independent contractor who is able to work in some capacity.Â  However, we find\r\n  Langdale presented satisfactory evidence to support the award of temporary\r\n  total disability benefits.Â  Langdale's last day of work was March 13, 2008, and\r\n  he had surgery to repair the left medial and lateral meniscal tears on August 7,\r\n  2008. Â At the time of surgery, Dr. Kirk Hensarling opined it was likely Langdale\r\n  would be out of work for six to eight weeks following the surgery, but &quot;working\r\n  as a flooring installer and being on his knees a great deal of time may be\r\n  difficult for him.&quot;Â  Although Dr. Hensarling has not specifically provided\r\n  a medical leave slip to the court, he has not released Langdale to return to\r\n  work and still sees Langdale on a regular basis. Â See Gilliam v.\r\n    Woodside Mills, 319 S.C. 385, 388, 461 S.E.2d 818, 819 (1995) (recognizing\r\n  the termination of temporary benefits and replacement with permanent benefits\r\n  is only proper upon a finding of maximum medical improvement).\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Langdale specifically testified about his pain and work\r\n  limitations. Â Langdale emphasized he cannot squat, bend his knee, bear weight\r\n  on his knee, or walk for any period of time without pain.Â  Given these\r\n  ailments, Langdale explained he would be unavailable to return to work because\r\n  it would require him to bend over and kneel for long periods of time. Â In\r\n  addition to Langdale's own testimony, the Appellate Panel reviewed a record containing\r\n  extensive medical evidence demonstrating Langdale incurred medial and lateral\r\n  meniscal tears.Â  See Fishburne v. ATI Systems Int'l, 384 S.C. 76,\r\n  87, 681 S.E.2d 595, 600 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;The [Appellate Panel] is given\r\n  discretion to weigh and consider all evidence, including both lay and expert\r\n  testimony.&quot;).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner heard the testimony at the hearing and found Langdale's\r\n  testimony regarding his medical condition credible.Â  In addition, the Appellate\r\n  Panel affirmed the single commissioner's finding as to the temporary total\r\n  disability benefits concluding the award was supported by reliable, probative,\r\n  and substantial evidence on the record. Â See Etheredge v. Monsanto\r\n    Co., 349 S.C. 451, 455, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002) (&quot;The\r\n  final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded\r\n  evidence in workers' compensation cases is reserved to the [Appellate Panel].&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the award of temporary total disability benefits to\r\n  Langdale. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nGEATHERS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Langdale is an\r\n  independent contractor, and none of the parties have contested the\r\n  compensability of the accident. \r\n[2] Â Paragraph 30\r\n  of the Agreement specifically states: &quot;Nothing set forth in this Agreement\r\n  shall be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture between [Harris\r\n  Carpets] and Gevity, and no fiduciary duty shall arise from the relationship\r\n  created hereunder. Â In no event may either party act as the agent of the other\r\n  party unless specifically authorized in writing to do so.&quot; \r\n[3] Although Harris\r\n  Carpets does not appeal the decision of the Appellate Panel, Harris Carpets\r\n  concurs in Gevity's argument with regard to Langdale's entitlement to temporary\r\n  total disability benefits.Â  \r\n[4] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4854","title":"Ross v.

In addition, she presented evidence he continued to harass her while she was\r\n  working at Dillard's department store.Â  She also testified he attacked her in\r\n  April, 2007 when she came home from work.Â  As a result of this attack, Husband\r\n  was arrested and charged with criminal domestic violence, and Wife received a\r\n  protective order against him.Â  Throughout her testimony, Wife admitted she\r\n  could not afford a lawyer; however, she always accompanied this admission with\r\n  testimony she continued to be afraid of Husband.Â  \r\nHusband testified he did not\r\n  threaten Wife and had very little contact with her following the divorce.Â  He\r\n  claimed he did not know where she lived following the divorce.Â  \r\nThe family court found\r\n  Husband &quot;prevent[ed] [Wife] from exercising her right to seek alimony\r\n  under the previous court order by the use of physical violence and threats.&quot;Â \r\n  However, the family court also found Wife &quot;later did not seek alimony\r\n  because she could not afford an attorney.&quot;Â  The family court concluded, &quot;While\r\n  the facts of this case may have at one time supported the rare application of\r\n  equitable tolling, the delay of two and a half years in seeking alimony is\r\n  unreasonable and does not reflect that [Wife] exercised the requisite diligence\r\n  in this matter.&quot;Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Â Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, ___, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see Lewis\r\n      v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, ___, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). Â However, we\r\n  recognize that the family court is in a superior position to determine the\r\n  credibility of the witnesses.Â  Lewis, 392 S.C. at ___, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n  655.Â  Furthermore, the burden is on the appellant to demonstrate the family\r\n  court's findings are against the preponderance of the evidence. Â Id.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we will affirm the findings of the family court unless the\r\n  appellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of the evidence is\r\n  against those findings.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in holding her claim for alimony was time barred.Â  \r\nThe family court relied on this\r\n  court's opinion in Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Services &amp; Rehabilitation Center,\r\n  377 S.C. 217, 231-32, 659 S.E.2d 213, 220 (Ct. App. 2008), rev'd, 386\r\n  S.C. 108, 687 S.E.2d 29 (2009), in which this court held: &quot;The time\r\n  requirements in lawsuits between private litigants are customarily subject to\r\n  equitable tolling if such tolling is necessary to prevent unfairness to a\r\n  diligent plaintiff . . . [and] is typically available only if the claimant was\r\n  prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising his or her rights . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  While this court held the case was barred by the statute of limitations, the\r\n  supreme court reversed, finding application of the doctrine was warranted by\r\n  the facts of that case.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Sr. Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr.,\r\n  386 S.C. 108, 687 S.E.2d 29 (2009).[1]Â \r\n  The supreme court explained the doctrine of equitable tolling may be applied to\r\n  toll the running of the statute of limitations &quot;to serve the ends of\r\n  justice where technical forfeitures would unjustifiably prevent a trial on the\r\n  merits . . . .&quot;Â  Id. Â at 115, 687 S.E.2d at 32.Â  The court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    equitable power of a court is not bound by cast-iron rules but exists to do\r\n    fairness and is flexible and adaptable to particular exigencies so that relief\r\n    will be granted when, in view of all the circumstances, to deny it would permit\r\n    one party to suffer a gross wrong at the hands of the other. Â Equitable tolling\r\n    may be applied where it is justified under all the circumstances. \r\n\r\nId. at 116-17, 687 S.E.2d at 33 (internal quotation marks\r\n  and citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe court noted the party\r\n  claiming the statute of limitations should be tolled bears the burden of\r\n  establishing sufficient facts to justify its use. Â Id. at 115, 687\r\n  S.E.2d at 32.Â  The supreme court cautioned, &quot;[E]quitable tolling is a\r\n  doctrine that should be used sparingly and only when the interests of justice\r\n  compel its use.&quot;Â  Id. at 117, 687 S.E.2d at 33. Â \r\nHusband was charged with\r\n  criminal domestic violence three times during the marriage.Â  The abuse continued\r\n  after the parties' divorce.Â  In June, 2005, Wife received counseling and\r\n  shelter from Safe Homes Emergency Shelter in Spartanburg citing fear of Husband\r\n  to counselors.Â  She told a staff person &quot;she had been threatened to be\r\n  killed if she pursued alimony.&quot;Â  Wife lived at the safe home for two months.Â \r\n  She claimed during that time Husband attempted to contact her through the\r\n  mail.Â  \r\nHusband's harassment of Wife\r\n  continued while she was employed with Dillard's department store.[2]Â \r\n  Wife testified Husband followed her home from work and hung around waiting on\r\n  her. Â In addition, she testified Husband came into the store and threw\r\n  balls of paper at her.Â  As a result, the store placed a trespass notice against\r\n  him.[3]Â  \r\nOne of Wife's co-workers from\r\n  Dillard's testified that on more than one occasion when she was giving Wife a\r\n  ride home from work, Husband followed them.Â  On other occasions during the\r\n  drive home, Wife received telephone calls from Husband, which Wife placed on\r\n  speaker phone.Â  The co-worker testified she could hear the anger in his voice.Â \r\n  On one occasion, the co-worker found Husband standing near her car in the\r\n  parking lot after Wife had borrowed it and had left her laundry in the car.Â  The\r\n  co-worker stated Wife said she was fearful for her safety, and the co-worker\r\n  believed the fears were justified.Â  \r\nWife stated that on April 6,\r\n  2007, Husband attacked her in the parking lot of her apartment complex.Â  He was\r\n  arrested and charged with criminal domestic violence as a result of the\r\n  attack.Â  Following this incident, Wife successfully sought a protective order\r\n  against Husband, which remained effective until April 18, 2008.Â  Wife filed her\r\n  complaint for alimony approximately three months after the 2007 attack.Â  \r\nThe family court found Wife\r\n  established Husband prevented her from bringing the alimony action by the use\r\n  of physical violence and threats.Â  However, the court found that at some point,\r\n  the reason Wife failed to bring the action was because she could not afford an\r\n  attorney rather than her fear of Husband.Â  Although Wife testified several\r\n  times she was unable to afford an attorney, these statements were continuously\r\n  coupled with testimony she was still afraid of Husband.Â  The evidence indicates\r\n  Wife was threatened and abused throughout the marriage, and the threats and abuse\r\n  continued until at least April, 2007.Â  The record does not support a finding\r\n  that at some point the threats and abuse stopped and only Wife's inability to\r\n  hire counsel prevented her from bringing the action.Â  Accordingly, we find the\r\n  family court erred in denying Wife's claim for alimony.Â  We therefore remand\r\n  the case to the family court to determine whether Wife is entitled to pursue\r\n  her claim for alimony.[4]Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, J. concurs.Â  \r\nPIEPER, J., concurs in a\r\n  separate opinion.Â  \r\nPIEPER, J., concurring:&nbsp; \r\nI concur in the decision to\r\n  remand this case to the family court.&nbsp; However, I would specifically find\r\n  that the posture of this bifurcated case does not warrant the application of\r\n  equitable tolling to the court-imposed time period ordered by the family\r\n  court.&nbsp; Instead, I would remand to allow the family court to make findings as to whether Wife has shown sufficient cause\r\n  to extend the original court-imposed time period in which to pursue her claim\r\n  for alimony.Â  See Rule 6(b), SCRCP\r\n  (permitting the enlargement of time within the court's discretion &quot;upon\r\n  motion made after the expiration of the specified period, for good cause shown,\r\n  to permit the act to be done.&quot;); Rule 2(a), SCRFC (not exempting Rule 6, SCRCP, from family court proceedings).&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, a remand is appropriate because the family\r\n  court employed a stricter equitable tolling analysis to the request, as opposed\r\n  to a more liberal Rule 6 analysis.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The supreme court issued its opinion in Hooper after the family court's order was filed.Â  \r\n[2] Although the record is not clear when the harassment\r\n  incidents occurred, it shows Wife began her employment with Dillard's in\r\n  October, 2005, and apparently she was still employed by Dillard's at the time\r\n  South Carolina Vocational Rehabilitation successfully closed its file on her in\r\n  November, 2006.Â  \r\n[3] Husband testified this event did not occur and he was\r\n  not banned from the store.Â  \r\n[4] Wife argues on appeal the family court erred in\r\n  applying the stringent standard of equitable tolling set forth in Hooper because the time limitation in the case was created by a judge rather than by a\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  We find this argument is not properly before the court\r\n  and is not the basis for our decision.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;).Â  However, on remand, the family court should consider applying\r\n  Rule 6 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides when a\r\n  court order requires or allows an act to be done at or within a specified time,\r\n  &quot;upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period, for good\r\n  cause shown, [the court may] permit the act to be done.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4855 ","title":"Allen v.

Stevens, Jr., of Loris, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Robert Gunn, Rick Joyce, and Timothy Gunn[1] (collectively, Appellants) appeal from the master's order finding them jointly\r\n  and severally liable for Dr. Aaron Allen's unpaid wages, prejudgment interest,\r\n  and statutory attorney's fees.Â  Appellants argue the master erred in: (1)\r\n  finding them personally liable to Allen under the South Carolina Payment of\r\n  Wages Act (the Act); and (2) awarding damages to Allen.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nAllen is a neurologist, who owned Atlantic Coastal Neuroscience\r\n  Associates, LLC (Atlantic).Â  Atlantic had offices in Lumberton, North Carolina,\r\n  and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  Appellants are former members of Pinnacle\r\n  Healthcare Systems, LLC (Pinnacle), which was organized in North Carolina.[3]Â \r\n  Pinnacle owned and operated Myrtle Beach Medical Center and Grand Strand\r\n  Imaging.Â  In June 2000, Allen, as the CEO of Atlantic, signed an employment\r\n  contract (Contract) with Pinnacle.Â  Pinnacle hired Allen to work as a physician\r\n  and neurologist, and to be the Director of Professional and Specialty Services\r\n  at Myrtle Beach Medical Center and Grand Strand Imaging.Â  The terms of the\r\n  Contract, prepared by Pinnacle, provided that Pinnacle was hiring Allen for a term\r\n  of five years, beginning June 26, 2000, and ending June 26, 2005.Â  Pinnacle\r\n  agreed to pay Allen a base salary of $1,500 per month, with additional\r\n  compensation bonuses of $25,000 per month payable on the first and the\r\n  fifteenth day of each month.Â  Additionally, at the end of each month, Pinnacle\r\n  agreed to pay Allen a bonus of sixty percent of collections to apply to all\r\n  electrodiagnostic procedures or techniques performed, as well as other\r\n  diagnostic procedures developed or used by Allen, less his regular salary.Â  The\r\n  Contract provided: &quot;In the initial transitional portion of the contract\r\n  while [Allen] is making arrangements to leave his Lumberton, North Carolina\r\n  practice, his pay will be prorated to [$1,000] per day (minimum of 8 hours on\r\n  the job each day).&quot;Â  The Contract was signed only by Allen and David\r\n  Vandergriff, the operating manager of Pinnacle, on behalf of Pinnacle.Â  Allen\r\n  worked for Pinnacle until March 12, 2002.\r\nAllen filed a complaint against Pinnacle, Vandergriff, and\r\n  Appellants, alleging they failed to pay him wages in violation of the Act.Â \r\n  Allen alleged Pinnacle owed him $780,000.[4]Â  Allen's complaint also alleged breach\r\n  of contract and sought injunctive relief.Â  Allen additionally sought to pierce\r\n  the corporate veil and the appointment of a receiver for Pinnacle.\r\nBy a consent order of reference, the parties agreed to refer the\r\n  case to J. Stanton Cross, Jr., the Master-in-Equity for Horry County.Â  A trial\r\n  was held before Ralph P. Stroman on January 15, 2009.[5]Â  During the\r\n  trial, Allen elected to proceed solely on the claim pursuant to the Act.Â \r\n  Appellants also made a motion for directed verdict during trial, which the\r\n  master denied.Â  The master filed his order on February 20, 2009, finding\r\n  Appellants jointly and severally liable for Allen's unpaid wages, prejudgment\r\n  interest, and statutory attorney's fees.Â  Appellants filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion to reconsider, which the master denied on April 9, 2009, after a hearing\r\n  on the matter.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nActions\r\n  for violation of the Act are actions at law.Â  Mathis v. Brown &amp; Brown of\r\n    S.C., Inc., 389 S.C. 299, 307, 698 S.E.2d 773, 777 (2010).Â  When reviewing\r\n  an action at law, referred to a master or special referee for final judgment\r\n  with direct appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals, the appellate\r\n  court's jurisdiction is limited to correcting errors of law, and the appellate\r\n  court will not disturb the master or special referee's findings of fact as long\r\n  as they are reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Linda Mc Co. v. Shore,\r\n  390 S.C. 543, 555, 703 S.E.2d 499, 505 (2010).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; South Carolina Payment of\r\n  Wages Act\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in finding them personally\r\n  liable to Allen under the Act.Â  We disagree\r\n  as to Appellants Robert Gunn and Rick Joyce, but agree as to Appellant Timothy\r\n  Gunn.\r\nThe\r\n  Act, found in sections 41-10-10 to -110 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2010), defines &quot;employer&quot; as\r\n  &quot;every person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, receiver, or\r\n  other officer of a court of this State, the State or any political subdivision\r\n  thereof, and any agent or officer of the above classes employing any person in\r\n  this State.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10(1) (Supp. 2010).Â  The Act also defines\r\n  &quot;wages&quot; as &quot;all amounts . . . which are due to an employee under\r\n  any . . . employment contract.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10(2) (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  Section 41-10-30(A) provides that any changes in the &quot;normal hours\r\n  and wages agreed upon [and] the time and place of payment . . . must be made in\r\n  writing at least seven calendar days before they become effective.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  Section 41-10-40 generally requires an\r\n  employer to timely pay all wages due, and section 41-10-50 provides that when\r\n  an employer discharges an employee, it must timely pay him all wages due.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-40, 50 (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\nIn Dumas\r\n  v. InfoSafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 195, 463 S.E.2d 641, 645 (Ct. App. 1995),\r\n  this court interpreted the Act, and held the legislature intended to impose\r\n  individual liability on agents or officers of a corporation who knowingly\r\n  permit their corporation to violate the Act.Â  &quot;To hold otherwise would\r\n  require us to ignore the words 'and any agent or officer of the above classes.'&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;[T]he South Carolina Payment of Wages Act is remedial\r\n  legislation designed to protect working people and assist them in collecting\r\n  compensation wrongfully withheld.&quot;Â  Id. at 194, 463 S.E.2d at 645.\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue Allen must prove they held more than a mere membership or a management\r\n  position in Pinnacle to hold Appellants individually liable.Â  Appellants cite\r\n  to section 33-44-303(a) of the South Carolina Code, which provides &quot;[a]\r\n  member or manager is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability\r\n  of the company solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager&quot;\r\n  and maintain this applies to Pinnacle.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-303(a) (2006).Â  Appellants\r\n  assert that under Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc., 370 S.C. 383, 389, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  541, 544 (Ct. App. 2006), rev'd in part on other grounds, 381 S.C. 597,\r\n  675 S.E.2d 414 (2009), and Dumas, they must have knowingly permitted\r\n  Pinnacle to violate the Act to be personally liable for paying wages that were\r\n  withheld from Allen, and no evidence exists that they knowingly permitted or\r\n  directed Pinnacle to violate the Act.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Appellants claim that after they transferred their interest in Pinnacle to\r\n  Vandergriff on October 1, 2001, they were no longer members of Pinnacle and no\r\n  longer had any authority to be involved with the company.Â  Appellants argue it\r\n  is irrelevant that they signed the transfer of interest to Vandergriff on\r\n  December 21, 2001, because the document said the transfer of ownership was to\r\n  be effective as of October 1, 2001.Â  They assert that &quot;express terms and\r\n  provisions in a contract as to time are effective and cannot be ignored,&quot;\r\n  and the effective date of a contract is the date the contract becomes enforceable\r\n  or otherwise takes effect, which sometimes differs from the date on which it\r\n  was enacted or signed.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  maintain that because they transferred their interest in Pinnacle on October 1,\r\n  2001 to Vandergriff, they were no longer responsible for the payment of Allen's\r\n  wages.Â  However, the &quot;Transfer of Interest of Pinnacle HealthCare Systems,\r\n  LLC&quot; agreement was not signed and dated until December 21, 2001, and\r\n  Vandergriff's answers to Allen's interrogatories confirmed the transfer of\r\n  interest did not occur until December 21, 2001.Â  Robert Gunn and Joyce also signed an &quot;Asset Purchase Agreement&quot; on October 25, 2001, selling\r\n  Pinnacle to Grand Strand Imaging.Â  The Asset Purchase Agreement states in\r\n  paragraph 3(b) that Appellants &quot;shall solely retain, pay, perform, defend,\r\n  and discharge all[] liabilities and obligations of the Seller of every kind . .\r\n  . including, but not limited to, any duty to any employee to pay wages,\r\n  compensation, or health, unemployment, or pension benefits . . . of any kind .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  The Agreement also states in paragraph 11 that &quot;Seller shall\r\n  retain the sole liability, which Buyer does not assume, for all salaries,\r\n  compensation, vacation time, sick time and other benefits accrued for the\r\n  benefit of its employees prior to the Closing Date.&quot;Â  Additionally, Joyce\r\n  testified that after October 1, 2001, he had to submit financials to\r\n  Southeastern Radiology, and file a corporate tax return for Pinnacle.Â \r\n  Furthermore, on March 21, 2002, Robert Gunn signed and filed Pinnacle's Annual\r\n  Report with the North Carolina Secretary of State.\r\nIn\r\n  Vandergriff's answers to Allen's interrogatories, he states that until a few\r\n  months prior to when Pinnacle was closed in February/March 2002, Robert Gunn or\r\n  Timothy Gunn and Joyce &quot;were in possession of almost all, if not all, of\r\n  the books and records of [Pinnacle]'s practice.&quot;Â  He further stated that\r\n  Robert Gunn and Joyce may still have possession of these documents, including\r\n  bank account records, payroll records for all employees, and state employment\r\n  security commission forms for all employees.Â  Vandergriff explained that when\r\n  Appellants transferred ownership to him, they gave him &quot;few, if any,\r\n  corporate documents,&quot; and shortly after the transfer, the practice was\r\n  closed because of a criminal investigation by the Drug Enforcement Agency.\r\nAllen\r\n  testified he received his last paycheck on September 18, 2001, and it was for\r\n  his work in August 2001.Â  He testified he then informed Robert Gunn, Joyce, and\r\n  Vandergriff in late 2001 that he was not being paid his wages.Â  Robert Gunn and\r\n  Joyce testified they handled the finances and payroll for Pinnacle.Â  They\r\n  testified Allen never told them he was not being paid, but September 18, 2001\r\n  was the last date that all the employees were paid.Â  They claimed they were not\r\n  responsible for paying employees after that date.Â  Robert Gunn testified he did\r\n  not think anyone was still working at the company after they left.Â  Allen\r\n  testified none of the members told him the interest in Pinnacle had been\r\n  transferred or that Robert Gunn and Joyce no longer had an interest in the\r\n  company.\r\nOn March 19, 2002, Allen's attorney sent a letter to Pinnacle, formally demanding that\r\n  Pinnacle pay his wages and other amounts pursuant to the Contract.Â  Appellants\r\n  objected to the introduction of the letter as hearsay, but did not deny having\r\n  received it.[6]Â \r\n  Robert Gunn testified he received the letter from Allen's attorney, and\r\n  responded that Allen should direct his inquiries to Vandergriff because he was\r\n  no longer a part of Pinnacle; however, Gunn did not present a copy of the\r\n  letter he allegedly sent back to Allen, and he continued to pay the debts of\r\n  Pinnacle for years after the transfer.Â  Joyce also admitted he received the\r\n  letter.Â  Joyce testified he and Robert Gunn decided to leave the company\r\n  because it was in financial trouble, but they never told the employees they\r\n  were leaving or they might not be paid their wages.Â  The Contract provided that\r\n  if Allen was &quot;terminated because of business reversals, change of venue,\r\n  reorganization of the parent corporation, change of employment . . . then [sixty]\r\n  days notice must be given and termination payment equal to [$240,000] for each\r\n  remaining year of the contract.&quot;Â  Although Pinnacle did not explicitly\r\n  terminate Allen's employment, they effectively did so by ceasing to pay him for\r\n  his work, and Pinnacle gave him no notification that the company was being sold\r\n  or that he might not receive any more paychecks.Â  Allen worked in excess of six\r\n  months without being paid any wages, and he left in March 2002, after being\r\n  constructively discharged.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  master's order concludes:\r\n  \r\n[I]t\r\n  becomes obvious that [Appellants] had an obligation to advise the employees who\r\n  were working and not getting paid that they may not get paid so they would not\r\n  continue working without the payment of wages. . . . [I]t is inconceivable and\r\n  incredible that [Appellants] did not know that [Allen] was not being paid his\r\n  wages.Â  In light of the fact that both R. Gunn and R. Joyce testified that they\r\n  handled the finances and payroll of the LLC and that every two weeks R. Joyce\r\n  got a list from Vandergriff as to who was to be paid on payroll, I find that\r\n  [Appellants] knew that [Allen] was not getting paid and knowingly failed to pay\r\n  [Allen] his wages in violation of [the Act].Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find the master's findings of fact are reasonably supported by the evidence,\r\n  and the master did not err in\r\n  finding Appellants Robert Gunn and Joyce are personally liable to Allen under\r\n  the Act.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  we find the master erred in finding Appellant Timothy Gunn personally liable to\r\n  Allen.Â  Timothy Gunn was\r\n  listed as a member of Pinnacle and owned fifteen percent of the company.Â  Appellants\r\n  assert there was no evidence that he was an officer or agent of Pinnacle, that\r\n  he was involved in the operation of the company, or that he had any knowledge\r\n  or contact with Allen.Â  The only testimony about Timothy's involvement in\r\n  Pinnacle came from his brother, Robert Gunn, who testified Timothy invested\r\n  $40,000 in Pinnacle, and &quot;it was [his] way of trying to get [his], rise my\r\n  brother up a little bit out of his station in life, see if this would help\r\n  him.&quot;Â  Therefore, without evidence that Timothy Gunn knowingly permitted Pinnacle to violate the Act, we cannot hold him liable simply because he\r\n  was a member of Pinnacle. \r\nAppellants\r\n  also argue Allen was not an employee; thus, they were not personally liable for\r\n  his wages.Â  However, Appellants cite no law for this assertion.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find Appellants abandoned this issue on appeal by failing to cite to any\r\n  authority.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (requiring citation to\r\n  authority in the argument section of an appellant's brief); First Sav. Bank\r\n    v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting when a\r\n  party fails to cite authority or when the argument is simply a conclusory\r\n  statement, the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal).\r\nII.&nbsp; Damages\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in awarding damages to\r\n  Allen; however, this issue was not included in Appellant's sole statement of\r\n  the issue on appeal.Â  Therefore, we need not address this argument on the\r\n  merits.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will\r\n  be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on\r\n  appeal.&quot;).Â \r\n  III.&nbsp; Attorney's\r\n    Fees\r\n  Appellants\r\n    also argue the award of attorney's fees to Allen was an abuse of discretion\r\n    because the master failed to address the six factors set forth in Baron Data\r\n      Systems, Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989).[7]Â \r\n    Appellants argued the master erred in awarding attorney's fees in their motion\r\n    to reconsider; however, they did not argue the award of attorney's fees to\r\n    Allen was an abuse of discretion because the master failed to address the six\r\n    factors set forth in Baron Data Systems.Â  In their motion to reconsider,\r\n    Appellants argued the award of attorney's fees against them was inappropriate\r\n    because a dispute existed as to whether the individual members owed Allen any\r\n    wages and they were no longer members of Pinnacle after October 1, 2001.Â  We\r\n    find this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.\r\n      Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic\r\n    that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n    raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n    review.&quot;).Â  Additionally, Appellants did not include this issue in their\r\n    statement of issues on appeal.Â  See Rule\r\n    208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not\r\n    set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot;).Â  Therefore, we find this issue is not preserved for our\r\n    review.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  Accordingly, the master's order\r\n    is\r\n  AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n  HUFF, J., concurs.Â  \r\n  PIEPER, J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate\r\n    opinion.\r\n  PIEPER,\r\n    J., concurring in part and dissenting in part:Â  I agree with the majority decision to affirm as to\r\n    Robert Gunn and to reverse as to Timothy Gunn.Â  However, I respectfully dissent\r\n    as to Rick Joyce and would reverse the trial court's determination that Rick\r\n    Joyce is personally liable under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act (the\r\n    Act) for wages owed to Aaron Allen.[8]\r\n  The Act mandates that &quot;[e]very employer in the\r\n    State shall pay all wages due . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40(A)\r\n    (Supp. 2010).Â  The Act defines an &quot;employer&quot; as &quot;every person, firm, partnership,\r\n    association, corporation, receiver, or other officer of a court of this State,\r\n    the State or any political subdivision thereof, and any agent or officer of the\r\n    above classes employing any person in this State.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10(1)\r\n    (Supp. 2010).Â  An officer or agent of a company may be held personally liable\r\n    under the Act when such person knowingly permits his or her company to violate\r\n    the Act.Â  Dumas v. InfoSafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 195, 463 S.E.2d 641,\r\n    645 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\n   In this case, Allen entered into an employment agreement\r\n    with Pinnacle Healthcare Systems, LLC (Pinnacle), a manager-managed limited\r\n    liability company organized by Robert Gunn.Â  Rick Joyce was designated a member\r\n    of Pinnacle and was involved in handling the company's payroll and finances.Â \r\n    Although Joyce's involvement with the company's finances provided him knowledge\r\n    that Pinnacle was violating the Act by not paying Allen's wages, as a member of\r\n    the company, Joyce lacked the authority to make any decisions regarding the\r\n    payment of wages.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-404(b)(1), (2) (2006)\r\n    (&quot;[E]ach manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the\r\n    [manager-managed] company's business . . . and any matter relating to the\r\n    business of the company may be exclusively decided by the manager or, if\r\n    there is more than one manager, by a majority of the managers . . . .&quot;)\r\n    (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  Joyce's lack of authority may be\r\n    determined from the extent of his involvement with Pinnacle's finances.Â  Each\r\n    pay period, Joyce would receive a fax from Pinnacle's operating manager that\r\n    designated who was to be paid and the amount of the payment.Â  Joyce would then\r\n    input the information from the fax into Pinnacle's system so a payroll service\r\n    could issue payments.Â  Although Joyce knew how much each employee was being\r\n    paid, he lacked the authority to make any decisions regarding payroll.Â  Accordingly,\r\n    I would find Joyce was not &quot;permitting&quot; Pinnacle to violate the Act.Â  See Baisden v. CSC-Pa, Inc., No. 2:08-cv-01375, 2010 WL 3910193,\r\n    at *7 (S.D.W.Va. October 1, 2010) (determining that a jury could find two corporate\r\n    officers knowingly permitted a corporation to violate the Act because the\r\n    officers &quot;were actively involved in the day-to-day management of the\r\n    corporation and regularly made determinations regarding the payment of wages\r\n    and commissions&quot;); see also In re Kouzios, No. 08â€“Bâ€“29463,\r\n    2011 WL 873410, at *1 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. March 11, 2011) (providing &quot;the Illinois\r\n    Wage Act makes officers and agents liable only if the officer or agent 'actively\r\n    asserted substantial control over the management and financial affairs of the\r\n    corporation' and 'knowingly permit[ted] the employer to violate [the Wage\r\n    Act]'&quot;).Â  Furthermore, without the authority to act on behalf of Pinnacle,\r\n    Joyce is not an &quot;agent or officer&quot; of the company.Â  See S.C.\r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-301(b)(1) (2006) (&quot;A member is not an agent of the\r\n    company for the purpose of its business solely by reason of being a\r\n    member.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-101 cmt. (2006) (&quot;In a\r\n    manager-managed company agency authority is vested exclusively in one or more\r\n    managers and not in the members.&quot;).Â  Therefore, I would reverse the trial\r\n    court on this issue since Joyce was not an agent or officer who knowingly\r\n    permitted Pinnacle's violation of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The original named defendants included: Pinnacle\r\n  Health Care Systems, LLC d/b/a Grand Strand Imaging and d/b/a Myrtle Beach\r\n  Medical Center; Robert J. Gunn; David V. Vandergriff; Rick Joyce; and Timothy\r\n  W. Gunn.Â  Pinnacle failed to\r\n  answer Allen's complaint, was in default, and was defunct at the time of trial.\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[3] Robert\r\n  Gunn was the executive manager and owned forty percent of Pinnacle.Â  Rick Joyce\r\n  and Timothy Gunn were both members and owned twenty and fifteen percent of\r\n  Pinnacle, respectively.Â  Robert Gunn and Joyce testified they handled the\r\n  finances and payroll for Pinnacle.\r\n[4] Allen testified he received his last payment from\r\n  Pinnacle on September 18, 2001.\r\n[5] It is not clear from the record whether Ralph P.\r\n  Stroman was acting as a Special Standing Referee for Horry County, as listed on\r\n  the cover of the briefs and record on appeal, or if he was acting as\r\n  Master-in-Equity for Horry County as he signed his February 20, 2009 Order, or\r\n  if he was acting as the Interim Master-in-Equity as he signed his April 9, 2009\r\n  Order Denying Motions to Reconsider and to Alter or Amend Judgment.Â  Therefore,\r\n  for the purpose of this opinion, we refer to him as a Master-in-Equity.Â  Â Â \r\n[6] Â Although Appellants objected to the letter as\r\n  hearsay, they did not object to Allen testifying as to the contents of the\r\n  letter.Â  The master admitted the letter subject to the objection, and allowed\r\n  Allen to testify about what he remembered.\r\n[7]Â  In Baron Data Systems, our supreme court\r\n  established six factors, none of which are controlling, that the court should\r\n  consider in establishing reasonable attorney's fees: (1) the nature, extent and\r\n  difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily\r\n  devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the\r\n  contingency of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality\r\n  for similar legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained. Â Id. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297.\r\n[8] I would also note that absent a finding of personal\r\n  liability under the Act, Timothy Gunn and Rick Joyce are not liable to Allen\r\n  for attorney's fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4856 ","title":"State v.

Johnson,\r\n  Solicitor, Fifth Judicial Circuit Court, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Appellant, Leon Hill, was convicted of two counts of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor in the\r\n  first degree and two counts of lewd act upon a child. Â Hill appeals,\r\n  asserting the trial judge erred in (1) denying his motions concerning the jury\r\n  pool on the grounds that the pool was not random and it failed to constitute a\r\n  fair cross section of the community, (2) admitting into evidence a DVD of the\r\n  child victim's forensic interview because the defense was deprived the\r\n  opportunity to cross-examine the victim in regard to the making of the video or\r\n  the victim's statements made during the interview, (3) allowing the State to\r\n  question an expert witness regarding the content of the video so as to elicit\r\n  the expert's opinion that the child had not been coached and was therefore presumably\r\n  truthful, (4) denying defense counsel's motion for a mistrial based upon the\r\n  State's failure to disclose information that constituted impeachment evidence\r\n  of the State's lead investigator, and (5) charging the jury the victim's\r\n  testimony need not be corroborated and allowing the State to inform the jury of\r\n  such where the statement of law was unduly emphasized in the State's opening\r\n  and closing arguments.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nVictim,\r\n  who was eleven years old at the time of trial, testified to his subjection to\r\n  acts of fellatio and anal intercourse with his uncle, Leon Hill. These acts\r\n  occurred in Hill's basement room, as well as in a house that Hill and Victim\r\n  were painting, during which time a man named &quot;Tony&quot; was present in\r\n  the house.Â  Victim's mother testified the matter was first brought to her\r\n  attention by Tony Smith, and she then immediately questioned Victim.Â  As a\r\n  result, Victim's mother contacted the police, took Victim to the emergency room\r\n  for an examination, talked to Investigator Livingston, and took Victim to the\r\n  Assessment Resource Center for an interview.Â  Investigator Roy Livingston, who\r\n  was subsequently assigned this case, met with Victim and his mother for an\r\n  interview, and then referred Victim to the Assessment Resource Center to be\r\n  interviewed by professionals.Â  Investigator Livingston also interviewed Tony\r\n  Smith, but did not take a written statement from Smith.Â  He stated he did not\r\n  write down what Smith told him, other than what he put in some typed notes.\r\nDr.\r\n  Joseph Campbell, the emergency room physician who saw Victim in the hospital,\r\n  testified Victim indicated to him that he had been subjected to anal\r\n  penetration with someone's &quot;privates&quot; and that Victim had been\r\n  instructed to perform oral sex on someone's &quot;privates,&quot; with the\r\n  latest incident having occurred roughly five days prior to the examination.Â \r\n  Dr. Campbell found a small abrasion during his rectal exam of Victim that could\r\n  have been consistent with sexual trauma, but acknowledged it could have also\r\n  been consistent with other non-sexual causes.\r\nThe\r\n  State also presented the testimony of Ray Olszewski, who worked at the\r\n  Assessment and Resource Center and was qualified as an expert in the field of\r\n  forensic interviewing in child abuse assessments.Â  Olszewski testified he\r\n  interviewed Victim following referral from the Sheriff's department.Â  Over\r\n  defense counsel's objection, the trial court admitted into evidence a DVD\r\n  recording of Olszewski's forensic interview of Victim, which was played for the\r\n  jury.Â  Olszewski explained that one of the tools he used in trying to discern\r\n  whether a child was coached in his accusations was to look for the level of\r\n  detail provided by the child, noting that children who are coached often lack\r\n  detail.Â  He then described some of the specific types of details he looked for,\r\n  and stated he looked for these details in Victim's interview.Â  Over objection\r\n  of defense counsel, Olszewski was allowed to testify that he saw those details\r\n  in Victim's interview.\r\nTony\r\n  Smith also testified for the State.Â  Smith, who was a friend of Hill's,\r\n  testified to incidents he observed while Hill and Victim were working with him,\r\n  in particular two occasions where he found Hill behind locked doors with Victim,\r\n  and Victim emerged on one of those occasions with his pants unzipped. Â Smith\r\n  later spoke with someone in Victim's family about his concerns.Â  Â \r\nDr.\r\n  Susan Luberoff, who was qualified as an expert in child sexual assault\r\n  examinations, testified that she examined Victim and found an anal area that\r\n  was abnormal and appeared to be a healed injury from some type of force applied\r\n  outside Victim's body, consistent with a penetrating injury.Â  Dr. Luberoff\r\n  distinguished the abnormality she observed from the abrasion noted in the\r\n  emergency room physician's chart.Â  She did not observe the abrasion in the area\r\n  noted by the emergency room doctor, but explained that the abrasion was\r\n  described as very small and she would have expected that to have healed rather\r\n  quickly such that she would not expect to be able to see it when she performed\r\n  her exam six days after the emergency room exam. Â She did note that an abrasion\r\n  is the type of injury that may be seen in a sexual assault examination.Â  The\r\n  abnormality she observed on Victim was an old, healed injury that, in her\r\n  opinion, was from a force applied from the outside of Victim's body. \r\nFollowing\r\n  submission of the matter to the jury, Hill was found guilty of two counts of\r\n  lewd act upon a child and two counts of CSC with a minor in the first degree.Â \r\n  The trial court sentenced Hill to thirty years on each of the CSC charges and a\r\n  consecutive sentence of ten years for the lewd act convictions, for a total of\r\n  forty years.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; Did the trial judge err in denying defense objections to the jury pool\r\n  and voir dire process made on the grounds that the pool was not\r\n  random and did not constitute a fair cross-section of the community?\r\n2.&nbsp; Did the trial judge err in allowing in evidence, over defense objection,\r\n  a DVD of a forensic interview with the child victim pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  section 17-23-175, where the defense was deprived of an opportunity to\r\n  cross-examine the child victim about the making of the video or about the\r\n  statements made during the interview in violation of the statute and in\r\n  violation of appellant's right to confront the witnesses against him in\r\n  violation of the confrontation and due process guarantees in the federal and\r\n  state constitutions?Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the trial judge err in allowing the prosecution to question the expert witness\r\n  regarding the content of the interview so as to elicit his expert opinion that\r\n  the child had not been coached and was therefore presumably truthful where such\r\n  inquiry clearly invaded the jury's exclusive role of determining credibility,\r\n  exceeded the time and place limitation on such testimony, and constituted\r\n  impermissible bolstering?\r\n4.&nbsp; Did the trial judge err in\r\n  overruling the defense motion for a mistrial, made on the basis of the State's\r\n  non-disclosure of information which would have been material to the defense in\r\n  that it constituted powerful impeachment evidence of the State's lead\r\n  investigator in violation of Rule 5, SCRCrimP and Brady v. Maryland, 373\r\n  U.S. 83 (1963)?\r\n5.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the trial judge err in charging the jury that the victim's testimony need not\r\n  be corroborated and in allowing the prosecutor to inform the jury that the\r\n  victim's testimony need not be corroborated where that statement of the law was\r\n  unduly emphasized by the prosecution on opening and closing?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Jury Pool\r\nWhen the case proceeded to trial, defense\r\n  counsel raised an issue with the jurors available for selection in Hills'\r\n  trial.Â  Counsel maintained, because other juries had already been selected\r\n  prior to his opportunity to draw from the pool, those available did not\r\n  represent a jury of his peers, but were an extreme group of society left after\r\n  jurors for the other trials had been selected.Â  In particular, counsel asserted\r\n  that four of the remaining prospective jurors were chaplains, pastors or in\r\n  seminary school, and that sixteen of the first twenty-four of the remaining\r\n  jurors were female.Â  He argued, because two other juries were drawn before his,\r\n  the randomness afforded to Hill had been significantly reduced.Â  He therefore\r\n  made a motion for a new jury pool.Â  After taking testimony from the jury\r\n  coordinator regarding the general manner in which juries are drawn and the jury\r\n  pools that are available, and in particular as to this case, the trial judge\r\n  found the jury selection process in this case was fair and adequate and did not\r\n  affect Hills' right to a fair trial. Â Accordingly, she denied Hill's motion for\r\n  a new jury pool. Â Â Â \r\nOn appeal, Hill asserts that the right to\r\n  trial by jury contemplates a jury drawn from a pool broadly representative of\r\n  the community and impartial in a specific case.Â  He contends the trial judge\r\n  erred in overruling defense counsel's objections to the jury pool as not\r\n  representing a broad cross section of the community where he was required to\r\n  select his jury after the other juries had been selected, such that his jury\r\n  pool did not represent a fair cross section of the community.Â  We find no\r\n  error.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  sixth amendment right to a trial by jury has been made applicable to the states\r\n  via the fourteenth amendment.&quot; State v. Warren, 273 S.C. 159, 162,\r\n  255 S.E.2d 668, 669 (1979). &quot;The right to trial by jury contemplates a\r\n  jury drawn from a pool broadly representative of the community and impartial in\r\n  a specific case.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhere\r\n  a defendant moves to quash a jury venire or challenges the panel or array, the\r\n  burden is on him to introduce or to offer strong and convincing evidence in\r\n  support of his motion, and the failure to prove such contentions is fatal.Â  State\r\n    v. Rogers, 263 S.C. 373, 381, 210 S.E.2d 604, 608 (1974).Â  Further, &quot;[s]uch\r\n  a challenge is without merit where it consists solely of an attorney's\r\n  statements, unsworn and unsupported by any proof or offer of proof.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section\r\n  requirement, the defendant must show that 1) the group excluded is a &quot;distinctive&quot;\r\n  group in the community; 2) the representation of this group in venires from\r\n  which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number\r\n  of such persons in the community; and 3) this underrepresentation is due to a\r\n  systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.\r\n\r\nState v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 21, 482 S.E.2d 760, 767-68 (1997). \r\nHere, Hill failed to\r\n  introduce any evidence to support his motion for a new jury pool.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence to support counsel's assertion that sixteen of the first twenty-four\r\n  available jurors were female, or that four of the prospective jurors were\r\n  pastors, chaplains or attending seminary school.Â  Counsel's challenge on this\r\n  basis was made solely on the basis of his unsworn statements to the trial\r\n  judge, unsupported by any proof or offer of proof.Â  Further counsel provided no\r\n  evidence that these figures on the number of women and those employed or\r\n  studying in the religious field would not be representative of a cross section\r\n  of the community.Â  Lastly, Hill failed to demonstrate a distinctive group that\r\n  was underrepresented or that there was a systematic exclusion of a distinctive\r\n  group.Â  Accordingly, Hill failed to meet his burden to support his motion to be\r\n  provided a new jury pool.\r\nII.&nbsp; Admission of Forensic Interview DVD\r\nIn a\r\n  pre-trial motion, the defense challenged the admission of the recording of\r\n  Victim's forensic interview asserting (1) the statute sanctioning such\r\n  admission was unconstitutional as it violated Hill's Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  confrontation and (2) it did not meet the requirement of trustworthiness under\r\n  the statute.Â  Thereafter, the trial court held a hearing on the matter and\r\n  concluded the recording met the requirements of the statute and therefore\r\n  determined it was admissible.[2]Â \r\n  The trial proceeded with the State first presenting the testimony of Victim.Â \r\n  The State then presented the testimony of numerous other witnesses before\r\n  presenting that of Olszewski, the forensic interviewer, through whom the State\r\n  sought to introduce the DVD.Â  Immediately prior to Olszewski taking the stand,\r\n  defense counsel objected to the introduction of the recording on the basis that\r\n  he would not be afforded an opportunity to effectively cross-examine Victim as\r\n  required by the statute since the recording was not in evidence at the time the\r\n  child was subject to cross-examination.Â  Counsel maintained that, without the\r\n  recording in evidence, once Victim left the stand the State's opportunity to\r\n  introduce the recording into evidence was lost.Â  The trial judge allowed the\r\n  recording into evidence over Hill's objection.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Hill contends the conditions required for admission of the DVD under\r\n  South Carolina Code Ann. section 17-23-175(A) were not met, and his right to\r\n  confrontation was ignored.Â  Specifically he argues, as this particular case was\r\n  presented by the State, the defense was &quot;actually wholly deprived of any\r\n  opportunity to cross-examine the child regarding his out of court statements as\r\n  presented by DVD.&quot;Â  He maintains, because the DVD was admitted into\r\n  evidence after the child victim left the stand, the State's mode and order of\r\n  presentation wholly denied him the right to cross-examine Victim as to the\r\n  making of and content of the DVD statement, thereby violating the statute's\r\n  requirements and his right to confrontation.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  17-23-175(A) of the South Carolina Code permits the admission of out-of-court\r\n  statements by a child under the age of twelve in criminal proceedings when the\r\n  following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n(1) the\r\n  statement was given in response to questioning conducted during an\r\n  investigative interview of the child;\r\n(2) an\r\n  audio and visual recording of the statement is preserved on film, videotape, or\r\n  other electronic means . . . ;\r\n(3) the\r\n  child testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-examination on the\r\n  elements of the offense and the making of the out-of-court statement; and\r\n(4) the\r\n  court finds, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that the\r\n  totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides\r\n  particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-175(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2010).[3]\r\nThe\r\n  Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause guarantees that &quot;[i]n all criminal\r\n  prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the\r\n  witnesses against him.&quot;Â  U.S. Const. amend.Â  VI.Â  &quot;The constitutional\r\n  right to confront and cross examine witnesses is essential to a fair trial in\r\n  that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and insures that convictions\r\n  will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at\r\n  trial.&quot;Â  State v. Martin, 292 S.C. 437, 439, 357 S.E.2d 21, 22\r\n  (1987).Â Â Â  Â  \r\nIn Crawford\r\n  v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 54 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held\r\n  that the admission of testimonial hearsay statements against an accused\r\n  violates the Confrontation Clause if: (1) the declarant is unavailable to\r\n  testify at trial, and (2) the accused has had no prior opportunity to\r\n  cross-examine the declarant.Â  State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 400-01, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 434, 439 (2009).Â  &quot;Statements taken by police officers in the\r\n  course of interrogations are considered testimonial.&quot;Â  Id. at 401,\r\n  673 S.E.2d at 439.[4]Â Â \r\n  However, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of\r\n  the declarant's prior testimonial statements when the declarant appears for\r\n  cross-examination at trial.Â  Id. &quot;The Confrontation Clause 'does\r\n  not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial\r\n  to defend or explain it.'&quot;Â  Id. Â (quoting Crawford). \r\n&quot;[A]s\r\n  to cross-examination specifically, the Confrontation Clause 'guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that\r\n  is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.'&quot;Â  Id. at 401-02, 673 S.E.2d 434, 439, (quoting United States v. Owens,\r\n  484 U.S. 554, 559 (1988) and noting emphasis in original).Â  &quot;Indeed, the\r\n  opponent's opportunity for cross-examination has been deemed the 'main and\r\n  essential purpose of confrontation.'&quot; Id. Â at 402, 673 S.E.2d at\r\n  440 (quoting Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 19-20 (1985)).Â  &quot;Thus,\r\n  it is the opportunity to cross-examine that is constitutionally\r\n  protected.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis in original).Â  Where trial counsel is\r\n  given the opportunity to cross-examine a witness but chooses not to do so,\r\n  there is no violation of the right to confrontation, for the Confrontation\r\n  Clause guarantees the opportunity for effective cross-examination, but not\r\n  cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent,\r\n  the defense might wish.Â  Id. at 402-03, 673 S.E.2d at 440.\r\nHere,\r\n  Hill was clearly afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Victim while Victim\r\n  was on the stand.[5]Â \r\n  Hill does not argue he was prohibited by any rule of law from examining Victim\r\n  about the elements of the offense or the making of the out-of-court statement\r\n  during his cross-examination of Victim.Â  He simply maintains that his\r\n  cross-examination of Victim was not effective because the State failed to first\r\n  place the DVD into evidence.Â  However, as noted, the Confrontation Clause\r\n  guarantees only the opportunity for effective cross-examination, not\r\n  cross-examination that is effective in whatever way and to whatever extent the\r\n  defense might wish.Â  In addition, we note Hill does not assert he was in any\r\n  way prohibited from recalling Victim to the stand to examine the child after\r\n  introduction of the DVD through the forensic investigator.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  requirements of section 17-23-175(A) were met, and Hill was not denied his\r\n  right to confrontation.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Testimony of Forensic Interview Expert\r\nDuring\r\n  direct examination of the State's expert witness Olszewski, who conducted the\r\n  forensic interview of Victim, the solicitor elicited testimony regarding the\r\n  signs the interviewer would look for in such an interview as to whether a child\r\n  has been coached.Â  When the solicitor attempted to ask a question particular to\r\n  Victim, defense counsel objected, arguing testimony about whether Victim was\r\n  coached would go to the expert's opinion of the truthfulness of the interview\r\n  and was therefore inadmissible.Â  The trial court directed the solicitor to\r\n  proffer the testimony she sought to elicit, and the following proffer of\r\n  Olszewski then occurred:\r\n\r\nQ:Â  We\r\n  already been through what red flags you look for and how one of the things you\r\n  look for is details in an interview.Â  In the context of this forensic interview\r\n  with [Victim], did you look for details regarding red flags as to being\r\n  coached?\r\nA:Â  Yes.\r\nQ:Â  And\r\n  what do you consider - - what do you in your capacity as a forensic interviewer\r\n  when you are looking for details, what do you mean by details?\r\nA:Â  We're\r\n  talking about like idiosyncratic details maybe for example were any lubricants\r\n  used?Â  Is the child able to describe sensory information, maybe how something\r\n  felt on their body for example.Â  Are they able to give descriptions of\r\n  locations things or, you know, things like that.\r\nQ:Â  And\r\n  was that present in this interview?\r\nA:Â  Yes.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel stated that &quot;[i]t\r\n  was the last question asked by [the solicitor] that we object to.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge found that the question of whether Olszewski saw the details was\r\n  not the same as whether Victim was coached, and even so, the question did not\r\n  elicit whether the witness thought Victim told the truth.Â  The judge further\r\n  noted that Hill's defense in regard to the forensic interview called into\r\n  question whether Victim had been over-prepped, and found the testimony was\r\n  admissible.Â  Olszewski was then allowed to testify consistently with his\r\n  proffered testimony, specifically indicating he saw the details in Victim's\r\n  interview.\r\nHill\r\n  argues that the State was wrongly permitted to ask the expert about the red\r\n  flags he looked for to indicate a child was coached in the offered testimony,\r\n  and that one of the things he looked for in an un-coached, truthful child was\r\n  detailed account.Â  He contends, upon the expert answering the question so as to\r\n  indicate that he did see the details in the interview with Victim, the jury was\r\n  clearly informed the expert believed the child was un-coached and truthful. Â Under\r\n  these circumstances, Hill asserts the trial judge erred in allowing the State\r\n  to offer expert testimony that could be construed as indicating the expert's\r\n  opinion was that the child witness was truthful and had not been coached.Â  He\r\n  argues the expert's testimony constituted a clear indication to the jury that\r\n  the expert found Victim's statement credible, and this evidence should have\r\n  been excluded as invading the jury's province and because its probative value\r\n  was outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial effect pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe law is clear that it is improper for a\r\n  witness to give testimony as to his or her opinion about the credibility of a\r\n  child victim in a sexual abuse matter.Â  See State v. Dawkins, 297\r\n  S.C. 386, 393-94, 377 S.E.2d 298, 302 (1989) (noting treating psychiatrist's\r\n  indication he believed victim's allegations concerning symptoms were genuine\r\n  was improper); State v. Dempsey, 340 S.C. 565, 568-71, 532 S.E.2d 306,\r\n  308-09 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding, where child sexual abuse counselor's testimony\r\n  included how he determined whether a child was telling the truth, his specific\r\n  finding that child victim's answers and responses did not include any\r\n  abnormality that would lead him to believe that child victim was not telling\r\n  the truth, his testimony that children were being truthful in ninety-five\r\n  percent of instances in which sexual abuse was alleged, and his conclusion that\r\n  child victim in that case was being reliable, constituted improper vouching for\r\n  the child victim).\r\nIn the case of State v. Douglas,\r\n  380 S.C. 499, 671 S.E.2d 606 (2009), our supreme court reversed this court's\r\n  finding that the jury could infer from the forensic interviewer's testimony\r\n  that she thought the victim told her the truth about being sexually assaulted.Â  Id. at 503-04, 671 S.E.2d at 609.Â  There, the forensic interviewer gave\r\n  testimony concerning how she conducted her interviews.Â  Specifically, she\r\n  testified that, in conducting forensic interviews and building a rapport with a\r\n  child, they talk about things, she introduces herself to the child, tells the\r\n  child what the interviewer's role is, goes over the rules of the interview, &quot;[they]\r\n  talk a lot about telling the truth and telling a lie and [they] make an\r\n  agreement with each other&quot; to tell each other the truth and, &quot;if [they]\r\n  get past that, if the child agrees to do that, [they] go on.&quot;Â  Id. at 504, 671 S.E.2d at 609.Â  The supreme court found the forensic interviewer\r\n  never stated she believed the child victim, noting the interviewer did not even\r\n  state the victim in that case agreed to tell her the truth, and the interviewer\r\n  gave no indication concerning the victim's veracity.Â  Id. at 503-04, 671\r\n  S.E.2d at 609.Â  Under those circumstances the court held, &quot;[t]here is no\r\n  evidence whatsoever that [the forensic interviewer] believed the Victim to be\r\n  telling the truth.&quot;Â  Id. Â at 504, 671 S.E.2d at 609.\r\nIn the case at hand, as in Douglas,\r\n  the forensic interviewer never addressed the veracity of Victim.[6]Â \r\n  He testified only that he saw the types of details in Victim's interview that\r\n  he would look for to determine whether a child had been coached.Â  He gave no\r\n  opinion on whether Victim was being truthful, or even that Victim had not, in\r\n  fact, been coached.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the admission\r\n  of this testimony.[7]\r\nIV.&nbsp; Mistrial Motion for Failure to Disclose Impeachment Evidence\r\nThe\r\n  next issue Hill raises on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in &quot;overruling\r\n  the defense motion for a mistrial, made on the basis of the State's\r\n  non-disclosure of information which would have been material to the defense in\r\n  that it constituted powerful impeachment evidence of the State's lead\r\n  investigator in violation of Rule 5, SCRCrimP and Brady v. Maryland, 373\r\n  U.S. 83 (1963).&quot;Â  In arguing this matter, appellate counsel little more\r\n  than quotes from the numerous pages of the transcript regarding various\r\n  arguments raised before the trial judge surrounding the matter, including\r\n  arguments that are not appropriately before this court.[8]Â \r\n  Hills' brief never incorporates those arguments as appellate argument, but\r\n  merely recites the lengthy arguments made by both trail counsel and the\r\n  solicitor, and fails to even maintain that trial counsel &quot;correctly argued&quot;\r\n  these matters or otherwise adopt trial counsel's arguments. Â Neither does Hill\r\n  narrow down the issue for this court to review.Â  Hill's appellate counsel\r\n  recounts the arguments made and the ruling of the trial judge and then follows\r\n  that recitation with the following paragraph, which is the only appellate\r\n  argument on this issue in Hill's brief:\r\n\r\nThis\r\n  ruling was error where the defense was not alerted to impeachment evidence\r\n  against the State's lead investigator which was known to the prosecutor, in\r\n  violation of Brady.Â  Under these circumstances, a mistrial was required.\r\n\r\nBased\r\n  upon the simple recitation of the extensive arguments raised at the trial\r\n  level, including several disruptions of side issues requiring in camera testimony, as well as the lack of clarity on the ultimate issue at the\r\n  appellate level and the fact that appellate counsel merely recites the\r\n  extensive testimony and arguments of counsel without even adopting trial\r\n  counsel's arguments, along with appellate counsel's two sentence conclusory\r\n  argument with citation to only Brady and no analysis whatsoever as to\r\n  why or how Brady applies, we find this issue is abandoned.Â  The mere\r\n  fact that Hill cited to Brady does not provide this court with any\r\n  guidance as to why the State should be deemed to have withheld material\r\n  impeachment evidence entitling Hill to a mistrial.Â  See State v. Jones,\r\n  344 S.C. 48, 58-59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (noting, where the only passage\r\n  in a brief relating to an issue appealed is a single conclusory statement which\r\n  leaves unargued the error assigned by exception, the issue will be deemed\r\n  abandoned on appeal; an issue will be deemed abandoned on appeal if it is\r\n  argued in a short, conclusory statement without supporting authority); Rule\r\n  208(b)(D), SCACR (requiring the content of the argument portion of the brief include\r\n  the particular issue to be addressed set forth in distinctive type, &quot;followed\r\n    by discussion and citations of authority&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  See also State v. Porter, 389 S.C. 27, 35-36, 698 S.E.2d 237, 241\r\n  (Ct. App. 2010) (holding, where the only citations in the argument section of\r\n  appellant's brief were to a North Carolina statute and two cases, but those\r\n  authorities did not support the specific argument raised, the argument was\r\n  deemed abandoned).\r\nV.&nbsp; Corroboration Charge\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Hill contends the trial judge erred in charging the jury that Victim's\r\n  testimony need not be corroborated and in allowing the prosecution to inform\r\n  the jury of the same, where that statement of law was unduly emphasized by the\r\n  prosecution.Â  He maintains the trial judge erred in allowing the prosecution to\r\n  unduly emphasize the no-corroboration charge in opening and closing arguments,\r\n  and where the statement of law had been unduly emphasized by the prosecution,\r\n  the trial judge further erred in nevertheless choosing to similarly instruct\r\n  the jury.Â  We find no error.\r\nSection 16-3-657 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code provides, &quot;The testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in\r\n  prosecutions under Â§Â§ 16-3-652 through 16-3-658.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-657 (2003).Â  These criminal statutes generally encompass the prohibition of\r\n  various forms and degrees of criminal sexual conduct, and include criminal\r\n  sexual misconduct with a minor for which Hill was charged.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-655 (A) (Supp. 2010).\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 631 S.E.2d 244 (2006), the appellant asserted\r\n  that the trial judge erred in charging section 16-3-657 to the jury because the\r\n  charge constituted an impermissible comment on the facts of the case, it\r\n  improperly emphasized the testimony of one witness, and it carried a strong\r\n  possibility of unfairly biasing the jury against the defendant.Â  Id. at\r\n  115, 631 S.E.2d at 249.Â  Our supreme court noted the trial court had charged\r\n  the jury that the State had the burden of proving the defendant was guilty of\r\n  the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, and further instructed the\r\n  jurors that they were the sole and exclusive judges of the facts of the case,\r\n  that the trial court was prohibited from commenting on or having an opinion\r\n  about the facts of a case, and that it was the responsibility of the jury to\r\n  assess the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the case.Â  Id. Â at\r\n  116, 631 S.E.2d at 249-50.Â  The supreme court then stated as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is\r\n  not always necessary, of course, to charge the contents of a current statute.Â \r\n  Section 16-3-657 prevents trial or appellate courts from finding a lack of\r\n  sufficient evidence to support a conviction simply because the alleged victim's\r\n  testimony is not corroborated.Â  However, Â§ 16-3-657 does much more.Â  In\r\n  enacting this statute, the Legislature recognized that crimes involving\r\n  criminal sexual conduct fall within a unique category of offenses against the\r\n  person.Â  In many cases, the only witnesses to a rape or sexual assault are the\r\n  perpetrator and the victim.Â  An investigation may or may not reveal physical or\r\n  forensic evidence identifying a particular perpetrator.Â  The Legislature has\r\n  decided it is reasonable and appropriate in criminal sexual conduct cases to\r\n  make abundantly clear--not only to the judge but also to the jury--that\r\n  a defendant may be convicted solely on the basis of a victim's testimony.\r\n\r\nId. at 117, 631 S.E.2d at 250 (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  court then concluded, while a trial judge is not required to charge section\r\n  16-3-657, when the judge chooses to do so, giving the charge does not\r\n  constitute reversible error when &quot;this single instruction is not unduly\r\n  emphasized and the charge as a whole comports with the law.&quot;Â  Id. Â at\r\n  117-18, 631 S.E.2d at 250.Â  The court determined, because the jury in that case\r\n  was thoroughly instructed on the State's burden of proof and the jury's duty to\r\n  find the facts and judge the credibility of witnesses, the trial judge fully\r\n  and properly instructed the jury on those principles.Â  Id. Â at 118, 631\r\n  S.E.2d at 250.\r\nHere,\r\n  the sole instruction the trial judge charged the jury on corroboration was as\r\n  follows: &quot;The testimony of a victim in a criminal sexual conduct\r\n  prosecution need not be corroborated by other testimony or evidence.&quot; Â Notably,\r\n  the judge immediately followed that statement with, &quot;Necessarily you must\r\n  determine the credibility of witnesses who have testified in this case.&quot;Â \r\n  The judge also included in her charge several instructions regarding the State\r\n  having the burden to prove Hill guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and further\r\n  charged the jury that it was the exclusive judge of the facts and was not to\r\n  infer that the trial judge had any opinion about the facts.Â  Thus, this jury\r\n  was thoroughly instructed on the State's burden of proof and the jury's duty to\r\n  find facts and judge credibility of witnesses, as well as admonished not to\r\n  infer that the trial judge had any opinion about the facts.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  single instruction on &quot;no corroboration,&quot; was not unduly emphasized,\r\n  and the charge as a whole comported with the law, such that there was no\r\n  reversible error in the &quot;no corroboration&quot; charge.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we find no merit to Hill's assertion on appeal that the trial judge erred in\r\n  allowing the prosecution to unduly emphasize this law in its opening and\r\n  closing.Â  First, it is questionable whether this argument is properly preserved\r\n  for review inasmuch as, although defense counsel made a pretrial objection to\r\n  the State being allowed to address it in its opening and closing, counsel\r\n  failed to make any contemporaneous objection to the State's references to the &quot;no\r\n  corroboration&quot; law in its opening and closing arguments, and failed to\r\n  argue to the trial judge that the State's references during opening and closing\r\n  &quot;unduly emphasized&quot; the statement of law.Â  State v. Johnson,\r\n  363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005) (noting, in order to properly\r\n  preserve an issue for appellate review, there must be a contemporaneous\r\n  objection that is ruled upon by the trial court); State v. McKnight, 352\r\n  S.C. 635, 646-47, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003) (noting contention must be raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by trial court to be preserved for review).Â  At any rate,\r\n  after a review of the State's opening and closing statements, we do not find\r\n  the State's arguments unduly emphasized this law.Â  Additionally, not only did\r\n  the trial judge take precautions to ensure the jury was thoroughly instructed\r\n  on the State's burden of proof and the jury's duty to find the facts and judge\r\n  the credibility of witnesses, the State also informed the jury of these matters\r\n  in its opening and closing arguments.Â  Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, Hill's convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral\r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although Hill mentions in his brief that he\r\n  challenged the constitutionality of the admission pursuant to the statute in\r\n  question before the trial court, he does not argue the constitutionality of the\r\n  statute itself on appeal or designate it is an argument in his statement of\r\n  issues on appeal.Â  Rather, he focuses on whether the statute's conditions were\r\n  met and whether he was denied the right to confront witnesses against him by\r\n  virtue of the fact that the recording was introduced into evidence through a later\r\n  witness, after the child had been called to testify.Â  Further, the trial judge\r\n  did not specifically rule on counsel's argument that the statute itself was\r\n  unconstitutional.Â  Thus, such argument would not be preserved for appeal.Â  \r\n[3] Although Hill cites the entirety of section\r\n  17-23-175(A) and generally asserts &quot;the statute's conditions were not\r\n  met,&quot; the only argument Hill makes concerning violation of this statute is\r\n  in regard to section 17-23-175(A)(3), which requires the child testify at the\r\n  proceeding and be subject to cross-examination on the elements of the offense\r\n  and the making of the out-of-court statement.\r\n[4] As noted, the record shows law enforcement referred\r\n  Victim to the Assessment Resource Center to be interviewed by professionals.Â  \r\n[5] The defense presumably had access to the DVD and was\r\n  aware of the statements made by Victim prior to Victim's testimony.Â  The record\r\n  shows Hill made pre-trial motions concerning the admissibility of Victim's\r\n  recorded statement, inquired as to whether the trial judge had an opportunity\r\n  to view the recording, and made no motion concerning a discovery violation\r\n  based upon any failure of the State to provide the recorded statement to the\r\n  defense. \r\n[6] Though Hill argues on appeal that the trial judge\r\n  improperly allowed the State to question the expert about the red flags he\r\n  looked for to indicate a child was coached, and that one of the things he\r\n  looked for in an un-coached child was detailed account, the record shows\r\n  defense counsel limited his objection at trial to the question of whether the\r\n  forensic interviewer observed the details in his interview with Victim, and\r\n  specifically agreed the State could &quot;talk about red flags looked for&quot;\r\n  by the forensic interviewer.Â  \r\n[7] Although Hill presents in his statement of issues on\r\n  appeal that the inquiry of the forensic interviewer invaded the jury's\r\n  exclusive role of determining credibility, exceeded the time and place\r\n  limitation on such testimony, and constituted impermissible bolstering, the\r\n  only argument Hill makes in the argument portion of his brief is in regard to\r\n  whether the objected to evidence impermissibly allowed the forensic interviewer\r\n  to indicate his opinion on Victim's veracity.Â  At any rate, the forensic\r\n  interviewer did not testify as to Victim's complaint of a sexual assault, much\r\n  less testify to any sexual assault in corroboration of Victim's testimony\r\n  beyond time and place of any such assault.Â  See Jolly v. State,\r\n  314 S.C. 17, 20, 443 S.E.2d 566, 568 (1994).Â  (holding, when a victim testifies\r\n  in a criminal sexual conduct case, evidence from other witnesses that the\r\n  victim complained of the sexual assault is admissible in corroboration;\r\n  however, such evidence is limited to the time and place of the assault and\r\n  cannot include details or particulars).\r\n[8] For instance, appellate counsel recites trial\r\n  counsel's argument concerning the alleged Rule 5 violation by the State, but\r\n  the only argument made concerning Rule 5 related to the State's alleged failure\r\n  to turn over handwritten notes of Investigator Livingston. After Livingston\r\n  took the stand and indicated he did not handwrite any notes from the interview,\r\n  but only took down Smith's personal information, and it was clarified that the\r\n  State turned over Livingston's summary of the interview to the defense, defense\r\n  counsel made no further argument regarding Rule 5.Â  Further, defense counsel\r\n  never based its impeachment argument on a Rule 5 violation when it sought to\r\n  &quot;clarify&quot; its argument on the matter the following day after the State\r\n  had rested, but only raised it as a Brady violation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4857","title":"Stevens Aviation v.

(Stevens) on the interpretation of a contract between DynCorp\r\n  and Stevens.Â  DynCorp argues the circuit court erred in (1) granting partial\r\n  summary judgment on grounds not before it; (2) incorporating a prior agreement\r\n  between Stevens and DynCorp into a later agreement between them; (3) holding\r\n  the later agreement was an enforceable requirements contract; and (4) ruling on\r\n  these issues without permitting DynCorp to conduct further discovery.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSometime before March 2000, the United States federal government\r\n  issued a request for bids on an aviation maintenance contract for C-12, RC-12,\r\n  and UC-35 airplanes owned by the United States Army and Navy (the Prime\r\n  Contract).Â  The Prime Contract provides that the contractor shall conduct\r\n  &quot;strip and paint&quot; services, &quot;aircraft condition inspection&quot;\r\n  (ACI), &quot;site organizational maintenance,&quot; and &quot;over and above\r\n  maintenance&quot; of C-12s, RC-12s, and UC-35s.Â  \r\nOn March 16, 2000, DynCorp and Stevens entered a &quot;Teaming\r\n  Agreement&quot; that imposed certain duties on each party to coordinate a\r\n  proposal to secure the Prime Contract, with DynCorp as the contractor and\r\n  Stevens as the subcontractor.Â  The Teaming Agreement also explicitly\r\n  incorporated two attachments.Â  First, it incorporated an attachment titled\r\n  &quot;Statement of Work,&quot; which provided that Stevens &quot;shall be\r\n  proposed to perform&quot; ACIs, &quot;strip and paint requirements,&quot; and\r\n  &quot;depot level maintenance for the C-12/RC-12 aircraft fleet&quot; above\r\n  DynCorp's capabilities.Â  Second, it incorporated an attachment titled\r\n  &quot;Proprietary Data Provisions,&quot; which limited both parties' rights to\r\n  disclose each other's proprietary business information.Â  \r\nDynCorp was subsequently awarded the Prime Contract, and on March\r\n  20, 2001, the parties entered a &quot;Subcontract&quot; that governs their\r\n  relationship in performing the Prime Contract.Â  Two provisions of the\r\n  Subcontract's &quot;Preamble&quot; provide the following:\r\n\r\n WHEREAS, the parties entered into a Teaming Agreement\r\n  (&quot;TA&quot;) executed on 16 March, 2000, which identifies the roles and\r\n  responsibilities of the parties as Prime and Subcontractor in a cooperative\r\n  effort to perform the requirements of U.S. Army Contract\r\n  DAAH23-00-C-0226&nbsp;(&quot;Prime Contract&quot;);\r\n WHEREAS, this Subcontract supersedes all prior written\r\n  or oral agreements between the parties, excluding the Proprietary Data Exchange\r\n  Agreement executed on March 16, 2000, and constitutes the entire agreement\r\n  between the parties hereto with respect to this Subcontract;\r\n .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, mutual\r\n  covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo pages later,\r\n  the Subcontract defines &quot;Aircraft&quot; as &quot;all Army RC/C-12 and\r\n  UC-35 aircraft covered under the Prime Contract.&quot;Â  \r\nSection C of the Subcontract specifically addresses Stevens's\r\n  duties regarding the work to be performed for DynCorp:\r\n\r\nC.1&nbsp; STATEMENT OF WORK/TECHNICAL \r\nSPECIFICATION\r\nA.&nbsp; The work shall be performed in accordance with the [Prime\r\n  Contract's Statement of Work] (Contract DAAH23-00-C-0226; Attachment 1).\r\nB.&nbsp; C-12/RC-12 STRIP AND PAINT.Â  [Stevens] shall provide all\r\n  labor, services, facilities, equipment, and direct and indirect parts and\r\n  materials required to strip and completely repaint aircraft (for other than ACI\r\n  requirements), at the direction of DynCorp.Â  Such work will be performed in\r\n  accordance with the [Prime Contract's Statement of Work], Section 4 (4.1.3)\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  C.&nbsp; AIRCRACT CONDITION INSPECTION (ACI).Â  [Stevens] shall\r\n  provide all labor, services, equipment, tools, facilities, tooling, lubricants,\r\n  excluding engine oil, direct and indirect parts and material, fuel, and strip\r\n  and repaint services required to perform all the requirements of Appendix P\r\n  [the Prime Contract's] Statement of Work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Â  Items found\r\n  defective beyond those addressed by Appendix P will be handled on an\r\n  Over-and-Above basis.\r\nD.&nbsp; OVER AND ABOVE MAINTANENCE.Â  [Stevens] shall perform both\r\n  Depot and Non-Depot Maintenance in accordance with Sections 4.0 AND 5.0 of the\r\n  [Prime Contract's Statement of Work].Â  DynCorp will reimburse [Stevens] for the\r\n  labor required for:\r\n .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n(3)&nbsp; Other over and above\r\n  tasks, as directed by DynCorp.\r\n .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\nE.&nbsp; SITE ORGANIZATIONAL MAINTENANCE.Â  As directed by DynCorp,\r\n  [Stevens] shall accomplish work, at [Stevens]'s facility, that would normally\r\n  be performed at the site by the site personnel.\r\n\r\nIn August 2009, Stevens filed a complaint against DynCorp,\r\n  alleging DynCorp breached the Subcontract by diverting C-12s, RC-12s, and\r\n  UC-35s to other businesses for maintenance work covered by the Subcontract.Â  After\r\n  the parties filed numerous motions, the circuit court granted partial summary\r\n  judgment to Stevens.Â  The circuit court held the Subcontract incorporated the\r\n  Teaming Agreement and constituted an enforceable requirements contract for specified\r\n  maintenance of the C-12s, RC-12s, and UC-35s covered by the Prime Contract.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in granting partial\r\n  summary judgment on grounds not before it?\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in incorporating\r\n  the Teaming Agreement into the Subcontract?\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in finding the\r\n  Subcontract created an enforceable requirements contract as a matter of law?\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in granting partial\r\n  summary judgment without permitting DynCorp to conduct discovery?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the grant of summary judgment, &quot;this Court applies the same\r\n  standard as that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.&quot;Â  Wallace v. Day, 390 S.C.\r\n  69, 73, 700 S.E.2d 446, 448 (Ct. App.\r\n  2010) (per curiam) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nA\r\n  contract or provisions within it are unambiguous if they are not &quot;susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;[1]Â  TEG-Paradigm Envtl., Inc. v. U.S., 465 F.3d 1329, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2006).Â \r\n  &quot;When the contract's language is unambiguous it must be given its plain\r\n  and ordinary meaning and the court may not look to extrinsic evidence to\r\n  interpret its provisions.&quot;Â  Id. (internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Grounds\r\n  Not Before the Circuit Court\r\nDynCorp\r\n  asserts it lacked notice the circuit court would consider whether the\r\n  Subcontract incorporated the Teaming Agreement.Â  However, DynCorp did not make\r\n  this argument in its Rule 59(e) motion or memorandum supporting that motion.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See In re Estate of\r\n    Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;When a party receives an order that grants certain relief\r\n  not previously contemplated or presented to the circuit court, the aggrieved\r\n  party must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue\r\n  for appeal.&quot;).Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Incorporating\r\n  the Teaming Agreement\r\nDynCorp\r\n  next argues the circuit court erred in incorporating the Teaming Agreement into\r\n  the Subcontract.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nTo incorporate the terms of extrinsic\r\n  material, a contract need not use &quot;magic words.&quot;Â  Northrop Grumman\r\n    Info. Tech., Inc. v. United States, 535 F.3d 1339, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2008)\r\n  (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  However, the contract &quot;must\r\n  explicitly, or at least precisely, identify the written material being\r\n  incorporated and must clearly communicate that the purpose of the reference is\r\n  to incorporate the referenced material into the contract (rather than merely to\r\n  acknowledge that the referenced material is relevant to the contract, e.g., as\r\n  background law or negotiating history).&quot;Â  Id. at 1345.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the Subcontract identifies the Teaming Agreement with sufficient particularity\r\n  to incorporate the entire document, but it does not sufficiently communicate an\r\n  intention to incorporate the Teaming Agreement as a whole. Â The provision is\r\n  contained in one of the preamble's &quot;whereas&quot; clauses, and generally,\r\n  &quot;whereas&quot; clauses &quot;are not considered 'contractual'\r\n  and cannot be permitted to control the express provisions of the contract&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  KMS Fusion v. United States, 36 Fed. Cl. 68, 77 (1996).Â  Read in\r\n  its entirety, moreover, the Subcontract reveals that the parties did not intend\r\n  to incorporate the Teaming Agreement as a whole.Â  Although incorporation does\r\n  not require magic language, the Subcontract incorporated other items by using language\r\n  with such clarity that it is obvious the parties understood how to incorporate\r\n  substantive provisions of the document into the Subcontract.Â  First, the\r\n  Subcontract explicitly provides that over fifty federal regulations were\r\n  &quot;hereby incorporated.&quot;Â  Second, the integration clause in the\r\n  Preamble immediately before the Teaming Agreement language provides that the\r\n  Subcontract supersedes prior written agreements except for the &quot;Proprietary\r\n  Data Exchange Agreement executed by the parties on 16 March 2000.&quot;[2] Â See TEG-Paradigm Envtl., 465 F.3d at 1339 (&quot;One common way to\r\n  incorporate extrinsic evidence is through an integration clause that expressly\r\n  incorporates the extrinsic evidence.&quot;).Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the Subcontract does not incorporate the entire Teaming Agreement, Stevens claims\r\n  the Subcontract's reference to the Teaming Agreement merely incorporates the\r\n  Teaming Agreement's provisions that establish the &quot;roles and\r\n  responsibilities&quot; of the parties.Â  Yet this contention must fail because\r\n  it would require this court to handpick which duties to incorporate without\r\n  guidance from the Subcontract.Â  The Subcontract's reference to the &quot;roles\r\n  and responsibilities of the parties&quot; established by the Teaming Agreement\r\n  is hardly precise enough to identify which roles and responsibilities the\r\n  Subcontract incorporates.Â  The Teaming Agreement establishes various duties,\r\n  many of which would be inapposite to the parties' relationship once the\r\n  Subcontract was created.Â  For example, the Teaming Agreement imposes a duty on\r\n  DynCorp to submit a proposal for the Prime Contract, a duty on DynCorp to award\r\n  the Subcontract to Stevens, and a duty on Stevens to help DynCorp develop the\r\n  proposal for the Prime Contract.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  Subcontract does not clearly show the Teaming Agreement was intended to be\r\n  relevant for more than background law or negotiating\r\n  history.Â  The circuit court erred in finding the Teaming Agreement was\r\n  incorporated into the Subcontract.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Requirements Contract\r\nFor various reasons, DynCorp\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in holding the Subcontract was an enforceable\r\n  requirements contract for maintenance of C-12s, RC-12s, and UC-35s.Â  In the\r\n  interest of clarity, DynCorp's arguments condense to two points of interest:\r\n  the Subcontract does not (1) apply to UC-35s or (2) create an exclusive\r\n  relationship between the parties for all of the services covered.Â  We agree\r\n  with both contentions.\r\n a.&nbsp; Applicability\r\n  to UC-35s\r\nFirst,\r\n  DynCorp maintains the Subcontract does not apply to UC-35s. We agree.Â  The\r\n  Subcontract does not include per-unit pricing for UC-35s, and therefore, it\r\n  cannot be construed as an enforceable requirements contract for that aircraft.Â  Ceredo Mortuary Chapel, Inc. v. United States, 29 Fed. Cl. 346, 351\r\n  (1993) (&quot;[P]er-unit pricing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is an essential element in a\r\n  requirements contract showing that the supplier is bound to perform regardless\r\n  of the quantity of work.&quot; (internal quotation marks omitted)).Â  Consequently,\r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the Subcontract was an enforceable\r\n  requirements contract as to UC-35s governed by the Prime Contract.Â  \r\n b.&nbsp; Exclusivity\r\n  of the Contractual Relationship\r\nSecond,\r\n  DynCorp insists the Subcontract does not create an exclusive relationship\r\n  between the parties regarding all of the services it addresses.[3]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nTo create an enforceable requirements contract under the\r\n  applicable law, a contract need not include the word &quot;exclusive&quot; or\r\n  minimum quantity terms; rather, the seller merely must have &quot;the exclusive\r\n  right and legal obligation to fill all of the buyer's needs for the goods or\r\n  services described in the contract.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Â  [A]n essential element\r\n  of a requirements contract is the promise by the buyer to purchase the subject\r\n  matter of the contract exclusively from the seller.&quot;Â  Coyle's Pest\r\n    Control, Inc. v. Cuomo,\r\n  154 F.3d 1302, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (alterations\r\n  in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).Â \r\n  Terms that suggest exclusivity include language that the seller must\r\n  &quot;furnish all labor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and related services&quot; to the buyer\r\n  or the buyer must order services for &quot;all its properties&quot; from the\r\n  seller.Â  See id. at 1305.Â  Even if a contract contains such\r\n  language, however, the contract is not an exclusive requirements contract if\r\n  the contract merely requires a party &quot;to furnish all labor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  and related services on assigned properties\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Id. at 1305-06 (first emphasis omitted).\r\nHere, the Subcontract includes language that at first\r\n  glance suggests exclusivity.Â  The Subcontract states Stevens &quot;shall\r\n  provide all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [ACI] required to perform Appendix P of the Prime\r\n  Contract's Statement of Work.&quot;Â  However, a thorough review of the\r\n  provisions establishing the remaining maintenance obligations reveals that the\r\n  Subcontract does not create &quot;the exclusive right\r\n  and legal obligation to fill all of [DynCorp's] needs for the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  services described in the contract.&quot;Â  Coyle's Pest Control, 154\r\n  F.3d at 1305 (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  As to the strip and\r\n  paint services, the Subcontract states that Stevens &quot;shall provide all\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. services required to strip and completely repaint aircraft (for\r\n  other than [ACI] requirements) at the direction of DynCorp.&quot; Â Similarly,\r\n  the Subcontract provides Stevens would perform site organizational maintenance and\r\n  over and above maintenance &quot;as directed by DynCorp.&quot; Â Consequently, we reverse the circuit court's holding\r\n  that the Subcontract is an enforceable requirements contract for C-12, RC-12,\r\n  and UC-35 maintenance.[4] Â DynCorp must pay Stevens for the services under the Subcontract only to the\r\n  extent that maintenance was performed.Â  See id. at 1306 (holding that because a contract was &quot;not enforceable as either a requirements contract or as an\r\n  indefinite quantity contract[,] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Coyle [wa]s entitled to\r\n  payment only for services actually ordered by HUD and provided by Coyle&quot;).Â  \r\n IV.&nbsp; Completion\r\n  of Discovery\r\nLastly, DynCorp argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in granting partial summary judgment because it considered\r\n  extrinsic evidence introduced by Stevens without permitting DynCorp to conduct\r\n  discovery to refute that evidence.Â  Because the\r\n  Teaming Agreement is not incorporated into the Subcontract, we agree the\r\n  circuit court erroneously considered extrinsic evidence.Â \r\n  Despite this mistake, however, we grant partial summary judgment without\r\n  further discovery on the issues before us. Â Our\r\n  holdings are a matter of law, and therefore, further discovery of\r\n  extrinsic evidence to interpret the provisions relevant to this appeal is\r\n  unnecessary.Â  See TEG-Paradigm Envtl., 465 F.3d at 1338 (&quot;When the contract's language is\r\n  unambiguous it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning and the court may\r\n  not look to extrinsic evidence to interpret its provisions.&quot; (internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted)).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the\r\n  ruling of the circuit court is \r\n REVERSED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both the Teaming Agreement\r\n  and the Subcontract provide they are to be construed using the federal common\r\n  law of government contracts and, if that law is not dispositive, the laws of\r\n  Texas.\r\n[2] In response to a question from the bench during oral\r\n  argument, Stevens's answer suggested the Subcontract's mention of the\r\n  &quot;Proprietary Data Exchange Agreement executed on 16 March 2000&quot;\r\n  refers to a document titled &quot;Proprietary Data Provisions,&quot; which is\r\n  part of the Teaming Agreement and was executed on March 16, 2000.Â  Thus, if the\r\n  Teaming Agreement were incorporated in total, the incorporation of this\r\n  proprietary business information agreement was unnecessary.Â  \r\n[3] DynCorp further emphasizes that the Subcontract fails\r\n  to include certain language required by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) to\r\n  create an enforceable requirements contract.Â  However, the FAR requiring that\r\n  language does not apply to the Subcontract because it is a private contract.Â  See 48 C.F.R. Â§ 1.104 (&quot;The FAR applies to all\r\n  acquisitions as defined in Part 2 of the FAR, except where expressly\r\n  excluded.&quot;); 48 C.F.R. Â§ 2.101 (&quot;Acquisition\r\n  means the acquiring by contract with appropriated funds of supplies or services\r\n  (including construction) by and for the use of the Federal Government through\r\n  purchase or lease .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;).Â  In addition, the Subcontract\r\n  did not incorporate the FAR despite incorporating fifty other FARs. See Northrop Grumman Info. Tech., 535 F.3d at 1344 (&quot;[T]his\r\n  court has been reluctant to find that statutory or regulatory provisions are\r\n  incorporated into a contract with the government unless the contract explicitly provides for their incorporation.&quot; (internal quotation marks omitted)).Â  \r\n[4] Although the ACI provision does not include &quot;at\r\n  the direction&quot; language, Stevens fails to argue the nonexclusive\r\n  provisionsâ€”the provisions addressing strip and paint, site organizational, and\r\n  over and above maintenanceâ€”are divisible from the remaining portions of the\r\n  Subcontract such that the Subcontract could create an exclusive relationship.Â \r\n  Therefore, we may not consider that argument to enforce the Subcontract.
