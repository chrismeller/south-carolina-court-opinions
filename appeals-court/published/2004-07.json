Clary, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  3842\r\nHeard May 13, 2004 â€“ Filed July 6, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nTaraÂ  Shurling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Michael Gonzales was convicted \r\n  of trafficking in methamphetamine pursuant to section 44-53-375 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and a $200,000 fine.Â  \r\n  He appeals, arguing the trial court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n  impose judgment due to a faulty indictment, and (2) erred in admitting improper \r\n  character evidence at trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGonzales was arrested after selling one \r\n  pound of methamphetamine to undercover agents of the Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department. Â This transaction was the culmination of an investigation \r\n  that began earlier the same day when Johnny Solomon offered to work as an informant \r\n  for the sheriffâ€™s office.Â  \r\nOn June 3, 2002, Solomon contacted \r\n  Officer Rhett Fox and informed him that he had the ability to purchase marijuana \r\n  from Gonzales.Â  At the behest of Fox, Solomon placed a recorded phone call to \r\n  Gonzales from Foxâ€™s office.Â Â  Gonzales informed Solomon that he could not sell \r\n  any marijuana, but could sell him one pound of the â€œother stuffâ€ for â€œthirteen \r\n  five.â€Â  Solomon testified he understood â€œother stuffâ€ to mean methamphetamine \r\n  and â€œthirteen fiveâ€ to mean a sale price of $13,500.Â  Gonzales and Solomon arranged \r\n  to meet later that afternoon in the bathroom of a local convenience store to \r\n  complete the transaction.Â  After three additional recorded conversations between \r\n  Gonzales and Solomon concerning the sale, a meeting time of approximately 5:50 \r\n  p.m. was agreed upon.\r\nAn undercover officer posing as \r\n  the interested buyer accompanied Solomon, who was fitted with a body wire to \r\n  record the transaction.Â  Â Fox and other officers monitored the wire transmissions \r\n  from a truck parked on the edge of the convenience store parking lot.Â  Â The \r\n  officers were waiting for the audio â€œtake-down signalâ€ before moving in to make \r\n  an arrest. \r\nGonzales arrived at the convenience \r\n  store with co-defendant Steven Shelhamer.Â  Gonzales and Solomon entered the \r\n  store and had a brief conversation, during which Solomon, as instructed, informed \r\n  Gonzales that the transaction was to occur outside.Â  Gonzales left the store \r\n  and moved his vehicle next to that of the undercover officer.Â  After he was \r\n  introduced to Gonzales, the officer asked where the drugs were located.Â  Gonzales \r\n  answered that they were in Shelhamerâ€™s possession.Â Â  Shelhamer handed a package \r\n  wrapped in black plastic and tape to the officer.Â Â  While weighing the package, \r\n  the officer gave the takedown signal, and the other officers moved in to make \r\n  the arrest.Â Â  Gonzales fled the scene on foot, but was later arrested.\r\nThe package handed to the undercover officer \r\n  contained 448.8 grams of methamphetamine surrounded by a layer of mustard and \r\n  a layer of barbeque sauce, [1]  \r\n  all separated by plastic and wrapped in electrical tape. Â Â Gonzales was \r\n  indicted for trafficking in methamphetamine pursuant to section 44-53-375 of \r\n  the South Carolina Code and tried jointly with codefendant Shelhamer.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (2002).Â  Appellant was convicted and sentenced to \r\n  thirty years imprisonment and fined $200,000.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nGonzales contends that his indictment \r\n  for â€œtrafficking in methamphetamine . . . in violation of Â§44-53-375,â€ was insufficient \r\n  to convey subject matter jurisdiction to the trial court because section 44-53-375 \r\n  does not contain the specific word â€œmethamphetamine.â€Â Â  We disagree.\r\nFor a circuit court to have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict a defendant of an offense, one of three things must occur: (1) the \r\n  grand jury true bills an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2) \r\n  the defendant waives presentment in writing; or (3) the offense is a lesser \r\n  included offense of a crime adequately charged in a true billed indictment.Â  \r\n  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 579, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002); see \r\n  also Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998); \r\n  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).Â  An \r\n  indictment adequately conveys subject matter jurisdiction to a trial court only \r\n  if it states the charged offense â€œwith sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to \r\n  know what he is called upon to answer.â€Â  Carter, 329 S.C. at 362, 495 \r\n  S.E.2d at 777.Â  In determining whether an indictment meets this standard, however, \r\n  a court should look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the \r\n  surrounding evidence.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, \r\n  78 (1993). \r\nGonzales was indicted for â€œTrafficking in Methamphetamine \r\n  . . . in violation of Â§44-53-375, The Code of Laws of South Carolina, (1976), \r\n  as amended.â€Â  Â Section 44-53-375(C) reads as follows:\r\n\r\nA person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, purchases, \r\n  or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance or otherwise \r\n  aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver, purchase, \r\n  or bring into this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession \r\n  or who knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of \r\n  ten grams or more of ice, crank, or crack cocaine, as defined and otherwise \r\n  limited in Sections 44-53-110 . . . is guilty of a felony which is known \r\n  as â€œtrafficking in ice, crank, or crack cocaineâ€. . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  Section 44-53-110 (2002), the \r\n  definitional section of chapter 53 specifically referenced in the â€œtrafficking \r\n  in ice, crank, or crack cocaineâ€ statute, defines â€œiceâ€ and â€œcrankâ€ as â€œamphetamine \r\n  or methamphetamine.â€Â  \r\nWhile the statute referenced in Gonzalesâ€™s \r\n  indictment does not include the specific term â€œmethamphetamineâ€ in its text, \r\n  it does list the termâ€™s commonly accepted synonyms of â€œcrankâ€ and â€œice.â€ Furthermore, \r\n  it clearly guides the defendant to the definitional statute where â€œcrankâ€ and \r\n  â€œiceâ€ are defined as â€œmethamphetamine.â€Â  Previously, this court has stated that \r\n  â€œ[a]n indictment phrased substantially in the language of the statute which \r\n  creates and defines the offense is ordinarily sufficient.â€Â  State v. Guthrie, \r\n  352 S.C. 103, 108, 572 S.E.2d 309, 312 (Ct. App. 2002); see also \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (Supp. 2003); State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. \r\n  86, 88, 275 S.E.2d 878, 879 (1981).Â  Here, with the exception of this transposition \r\n  of synonyms, the indictment is phrased in almost the exact language of the statute.Â  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 745 (2001), the supreme court held an indictment, even one that fails \r\n  to allege a key element of an offense, sufficiently vests the circuit court \r\n  with subject matter jurisdiction when a statute outlining the elements of the \r\n  offense is referenced in the body of the indictment.Â  Owens, 346 S.C. \r\n  at 649, 552 S.E.2d at 751-52.Â  In the case at bar, the indictment referenced \r\n  such a statute, which in turn, clarified the elements of the offense by its \r\n  own reference to a separate definitional statute.Â  The fact that the statute \r\n  referenced by Gonzalesâ€™s indictment referenced another statute for definitional \r\n  clarification does not constitute a substantial factual departure from the holding \r\n  of Owens.\r\nWhen viewing the sufficiency of an indictment \r\n  from a practical standpoint, our fundamental determination â€œis not whether it \r\n  could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the \r\n  defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€ Guthrie, 352 S.C. at \r\n  108, 572 S.E.2d at 312.Â  In the case before us, a specific listing of the alternative \r\n  terms for methamphetamine (i.e. â€œice,â€ â€œcrankâ€) in the body of the indictment \r\n  would certainly make the indictment more definite and certain. However, the \r\n  indictment in question, when practically viewed, contained the necessary elements \r\n  of the offense and was clearly sufficient to apprise Gonzales of the charges \r\n  he was to answer in court.Â  Thus, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict Gonzales of the charged offense.\r\nII.Â  Admissibility of Evidence Concerning the \r\n  Investigation of Appellant\r\nGonzales next argues the testimony of Fox and \r\n  Solomon singled him out as a particular subject of a police investigation and \r\n  therefore improperly called into question his character.Â  Gonzales contends \r\n  this admission of testimony was reversible error on the part of the trial court.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nRule 404, SCRE, limits the circumstances when \r\n  a defendantâ€™s character may be properly brought into evidence.Â  Subsection (a) \r\n  of the rule reads in relevant part: â€œEvidence of a personâ€™s character or a trait \r\n  of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity \r\n  therewith on a particular occasion.â€Â  Pursuant to this rule, South Carolina \r\n  courts have held that while â€œ[e]vidence that police began an investigation because \r\n  of reports of criminal activity [is] admissible . . . , identification of an \r\n  individual as the suspect of a criminal investigation, based upon speculation \r\n  and effectively calling into question that individualâ€™s character, is not.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 575, 541 S.E.2d 813, 820 (2001) (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nAt trial, Officer Fox testified concerning his \r\n  initial questioning of Solomon as follows:\r\n\r\nQ:Â  And what are you trying â€“ are you trying to determine \r\n  at [the initial questioning of an informant], if this person can be of use to \r\n  you?\r\nA:Â  Yes, sir, basically . . . we want to know if they are \r\n  aware of actors in the drug trade that may be of interest or that can produce \r\n  drugs to this person.\r\nQ:Â  And during this debriefing did the name [of Gonzales] \r\n  come up?\r\n\r\nBefore Fox could respond to this line of questioning, Gonzales \r\n  objected and the jury was sent from the courtroom.Â  After hearing arguments \r\n  by both counsel, the trial judge reiterated his pretrial ruling on this issue, \r\n  namely that the prosecution could continue to elicit testimony regarding the \r\n  meeting between Fox and Solomon but was to carefully avoid any reference to \r\n  Gonzalesâ€™s prior criminal convictions or any specific behavior regarding drug \r\n  sales. Â The State was to limit all questioning to the alleged transaction \r\n  at issue at trial.Â  \r\nAfter the jury was allowed back into the courtroom, Foxâ€™s \r\n  testimony returned only briefly to Gonzalesâ€™s status as a criminal suspect:\r\n\r\nQ: In your discussions with Mr. Solomon, were you able to \r\n  make a determination as to whether or not he could contact [Gonzales] for you?\r\nA:Â  Yes\r\nQ: Were you able to make a â€“ and what was that determination?\r\nA: He knew him personally and knew how to reach him.\r\n. . . . \r\nA: This was an attempt to conduct an investigation that \r\n  would result in an arrest and confiscation of illegal drugs.\r\nQ:Â  From [Gonzales]?\r\nA:Â  Correct.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the above testimony was not \r\n  admitted in error because Gonzalesâ€™s identification as a suspect of this investigation \r\n  was not â€œbased on speculation,â€ nor did this identification â€œeffectively [call] \r\n  into question [Gonzalesâ€™s] character.â€Â  Jones, 343 S.C. at 575, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  at 820.Â  Before Gonzales was identified to the jury as a criminal suspect due \r\n  to his known reputation as an â€œactor in the drug trade,â€ an objection was made, \r\n  and the jury was sent from the courtroom.Â  At no time did testimony reveal to \r\n  the jury that the police began their investigation of Gonzales because of speculative \r\n  reports that Gonzales was a known drug dealer or a person of criminal character.Â  \r\n  Later testimony instead reflected that Gonzales became a suspect because of \r\n  the specific personal knowledge of Fox that the informant could, on this particular \r\n  occasion only, purchase illegal drugs from Gonzales.Â  \r\nThe purpose of Rule 404 is to exclude evidence that tends \r\n  to prove a defendantâ€™s guilt based merely on his reputation or character, i.e. \r\n  evidence which implies â€œbecause this person is a bad guy or acted in a manner \r\n  similar to this before, he is guilty.â€Â Â  Therefore, evidence that shows a defendant \r\n  was singled out as a particular suspect in a criminal investigation merely because \r\n  of his character or reputation is inadmissible.Â  See Jones, 343 \r\n  S.C. at 574-76, 541 S.E.2d at 819-20 (finding testimony which singled out defendant \r\n  as a murder suspect merely because of reports he held a â€œgrudgeâ€ inadmissible); \r\n  German, 325 S.C. at 26-28, 478 S.E.2d at 688-89 (finding testimony that \r\n  defendant was a criminal suspect due to generalized reports that he was a drug \r\n  dealer inadmissible).Â  Had Fox answered counselâ€™s question and identified Gonzales \r\n  as a known â€œactor in the drug trade,â€ Rule 404 would clearly have been triggered \r\n  in this case.Â  However, because an objection was made and the question was not \r\n  answered, Gonzalesâ€™s character was never effectively questioned.Â  What Jones \r\n  and its ilk prohibit is not evidence that a defendant was once considered a \r\n  suspect in the particular criminal investigation which led to the defendantâ€™s \r\n  arrest, but evidence a defendant was made a suspect due to generalized reports \r\n  of his character or past conduct. \r\nIn the case at bar, all testimony concerning Gonzalesâ€™s \r\n  status as the suspect of this criminal investigation was based on the personal \r\n  knowledge of informant Solomon that he could purchase drugs from Gonzales on \r\n  a specific occasion.Â  Testimony regarding personal knowledge of a particular \r\n  criminal transaction is not character evidence and therefore not inadmissible \r\n  under Rule 404, SCRE.Â Â  Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of the testimony \r\n  at issue was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find that the trial court had subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to convict Gonzales and that the disputed testimony was not inadmissible \r\n  under Rule 404, SCRE, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  At trial, Officer Fox explained that drugs are \r\n    often wrapped â€œwith any type of scented objectâ€ to conceal the odor of drugs \r\n    from a trained drug dog. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3841","title":"Stone v.

Nichols, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  action, Traylor Brothers, Inc. and St. Paul Insurance Company appeal a circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s finding that Teresa Stone was entitled to benefits for injuries she \r\n  sustained when her estranged boyfriend assaulted her at work. We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nTeresa Stone (â€œClaimantâ€) and Kevin Stone (â€œStoneâ€) \r\n  began a relationship in July of 1998. \r\n  [1]  The two apparently started living together in October of that year. \r\n  [2]  The relationship became difficult and was â€œall over and done withâ€ \r\n  by the Christmas holidays. Claimant however continued living with Stone. While \r\n  still living together, Claimant and Stone started working for Traylor Brothers \r\n  (â€œEmployerâ€) in January of 1999. [3]  Two or three weeks later, Claimant spent five \r\n  nights away from the home she shared with Stone. The morning after the fifth \r\n  day, Claimant rode to work with a co-worker named Butch. When they arrived, \r\n  Stone approached Claimant as she was going to retrieve her work tools. The two \r\n  had a physical confrontation. The other workers separated them but they resumed \r\n  their fight and had to be separated a second time. Stone allegedly â€œsnatchedâ€ \r\n  Claimant by the hair, â€œpulled [her] across the parking lot,â€ and told her â€œwe \r\n  cannot work for the same company. You leave or I leave.â€ Stone also told a male \r\n  co-worker â€œLeave my lady alone.â€ \r\nClaimant sustained some injuries as a result of \r\n  the altercation and sought a hearing with the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commission (â€œthe Commissionâ€).Â  The commissioner concluded that Claimantâ€™s injuries \r\n  were not compensable.Â  The full Commission affirmed the findings. Claimant appealed \r\n  to the circuit court. That court reversed the decision, reasoning that it had \r\n  been reached without substantial evidence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from the Commission, neither this \r\n  court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where \r\n  the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 \r\n  S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s \r\n  factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge \r\n  v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001). â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, \r\n  would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission \r\n  reached.â€ Id. We review the Commissionâ€™s ruling only to determine whether \r\n  it is supported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law. \r\n  SeeÂ  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues that the circuit court erred in \r\n  reversing theÂ  Commissionâ€™s decision. We agree.\r\nTo receive a workerâ€™s compensation award in South \r\n  Carolina, an employee must show that her injury arose â€œout ofâ€ and â€œin the course \r\n  of employment.â€Â  Howell v. Pac. Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).Â  While the term â€œin the course ofâ€ refers to the time, \r\n  place, and circumstances of the accident, the term â€œarising out ofâ€ refers to \r\n  the origin or the cause of the accident.Â  Id.Â  An injury arises out of \r\n  oneâ€™s employment â€œwhen there is a causal connection between the conditions under \r\n  which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.â€Â  Broughton \r\n  v. S. of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 497, 520 S.E.2d 634, 638 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  The injury need not be expected or even foreseeable, but â€œit must appear to \r\n  have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed \r\n  from that source as a rational consequence.â€Â  Carter v. Penney Tire &amp; \r\n  Recapping Co., 261 S.C. 341, 345, 200 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1973). \r\nHere, the dispute between Claimant and Stone originated \r\n  from their personal relationship. That relationship started deteriorating even \r\n  before Stone and Claimant started working for Employer. They had previously \r\n  fought at home and on other job sites. By all accounts, Stone was acting out \r\n  of jealously the morning he approached Claimant at work. There is clearly ample \r\n  support for the Commissionâ€™s decision. See Bright v. Orr-Lyons Mills, \r\n  285 S.C. 58, 61, 328 S.E.2d 68, 71 (1985) (holding that â€œwhen the dispute that \r\n  culminates in an assault arises out of the claimantâ€™s private life, the injury \r\n  is not ordinarily compensableâ€); Allsep v. Daniel Constr. Co., 216 S.C. \r\n  268, 270, 57 S.E.2d 427, 428 (1950) (excluding from coverage an injury â€œwhich \r\n  comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart \r\n  from the employmentâ€). \r\nAdmittedly, the Commission could have reached a \r\n  different conclusion. However, that fact does not alter the scope of our inquiry. \r\n  See Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv.

Therrell appeals the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order affirming the full commissionâ€™s determination that the injuries \r\n  to her right upper extremity are compensable as an injury to her arm rather \r\n  than to her shoulder.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nWhile employed as a waitress at Jerryâ€™s \r\n  Travel Stop in Clarendon County, Therrell slipped and fell, injuring her right \r\n  arm and shoulder.Â  \r\nAt \r\n  the hearing before the single commissioner, Therrell described the condition \r\n  of her right arm and shoulder following the accident.Â  She testified she had \r\n  difficulty performing everyday tasks such as washing clothes, operating a vacuum \r\n  cleaner, or getting dressed.Â  She was unable to lift things above her shoulder \r\n  level, requiring her to rely upon her co-workers to assist her in doing the \r\n  heavier parts of her job.Â  Therrell described experiencing â€œburning,â€ â€œgrinding,â€ \r\n  and â€œpoppingâ€ sensations in her right shoulder that were aggravated by repetitive \r\n  activities.Â  She also testified she has reduced strength in her right hand.Â  \r\n  Even though she was right-hand dominant prior to the accident, she testified \r\n  her injury required her to rely primarily on her left hand and arm for tasks \r\n  associated with her job.Â  \r\nThe \r\n  single commissioner concluded Therrellâ€™s injury to her right upper extremity \r\n  resulted in permanent partial disability of twenty percent pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (Supp. 2003), the section prescribing compensation for specific, \r\n  scheduled body parts.Â  Therrell appealed the award to the full commission, arguing \r\n  inter alia the commissioner erred in concluding the injury was \r\n  to her arm rather than her shoulder.Â  The full commission affirmed the award \r\n  of the single commissioner, adopting her findings of fact, but increasing Therrellâ€™s \r\n  permanent disability rating from twenty percent to thirty percent.Â  The circuit \r\n  court affirmed the full commissionâ€™s findings.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\nOur review \r\n  of a decision of the workersâ€™ compensation commission is governed by the Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 133, 276 S.E.2d 304, \r\n  305 (1981).Â  Although this court may not substitute its judgment for that of \r\n  the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, we \r\n  may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nThe question before us is whether \r\n  the commission properly classified Therrellâ€™s injury compensable as a scheduled \r\n  body member pursuant to South Carolina Code section 42-9-30 (Supp. 2003). [1]  Â The answer is in the affirmative.Â  \r\nSection 42-9-30 sets forth a schedule \r\n  prescribing the amount of compensation to be awarded for loss of various, specifically \r\n  enumerated body parts and organs.Â  Compensation for injuries to body parts not \r\n  covered by the statute has been prescribed by the workersâ€™compensation commission \r\n  under Regulation 67-1101.Â  For all other unscheduled injuries, section 42-9-30(20) \r\n  provides:Â  â€œFor the total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, a member, organ \r\n  or part of the body not covered herein and not covered under Â§Â§ 42-9-10 or 42-9-20, \r\n  sixty-six and two thirds of the average weekly wages not to exceed five hundred \r\n  weeks.â€Â  \r\nIn this case, the single commissioner \r\n  awarded compensation to Therrell under section 42-9-30(13), which provides: \r\n  â€œFor the loss of an arm, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly \r\n  wages during two hundred twenty weeks.â€Â  Therrell claims this was error.Â  She \r\n  asserts the injury was to her shoulder, not to her arm.Â  Therefore, because \r\n  the shoulder is not among the body parts listed in section 42-9-30, Therrell \r\n  argues her disability was instead governed by the catch-all provision of 42-9-30(20) \r\n  which would potentially allow for a longer period of compensationâ€”up to 500 \r\n  weeks rather than the maximum of 220 weeks scheduled for the loss of an arm.Â  \r\n  \r\nTherrell asserts that the cases of \r\n  Gilliam v. Woodside Mills, 312 S.C. 523, 435 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 1993), \r\n  overruled on other grounds, 319 S.C. 385, 461 S.E.2d 818 (1995), and \r\n  Roper&nbsp;v. Kimbrellâ€™s of Greenville, Inc., 231 S.C. 453, 99 S.E.2d \r\n  52 (1957), lend support to her position.Â  Her reliance on these cases is misplaced.Â  \r\n  In Gilliam, the issue before the court was whether the claimant suffered \r\n  injuries to more than one part of the body.Â  The compensable accident damaged \r\n  Gilliamâ€™s right knee and hip, requiring a total hip replacement.Â  The court \r\n  determined these were multiple injuries justifying an award for permanent and \r\n  total disability pursuant to section 42-9-10 (Supp. 2003).Â  In contrast, Therrell \r\n  offered no evidence that she sustained more than one injury.Â  \r\nThe Roper \r\n  court affirmed an award of loss of use to both arms, even though there was no \r\n  direct injury to the arms themselves.Â  The Roper court held the determination \r\n  was an issue of fact, stating nothing â€œin the statute relating to workmenâ€™s \r\n  compensation suggests restriction of their meaning to such total or partial \r\n  loss of use as has resulted from a direct injury to the member itself.â€Â  Roper, \r\n  231 S.C. at 456, 99 S.E.2d at 54.Â  \r\nIn deciding whether to award compensation \r\n  as for a scheduled injury as opposed to a non-scheduled general disability, \r\n  our supreme court has held:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    The commission may award compensation \r\n      to a claimant under the scheduled loss statute rather than the general disability \r\n      statutes so long as there is substantial evidence to support such an award.\r\n    An award under the scheduled \r\n      loss statute, however, is premised upon the threshold requirement that the \r\n      claimant prove a loss, or loss of use of, a specific â€œmember, organ, or \r\n      part of the body.â€\r\n  \r\n\r\nFields \r\n  v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 555-56, 393 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1990) \r\n  (citation omitted). \r\nBased on our review of the record, \r\n  we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the commissionâ€™s finding \r\n  that Therrellâ€™s injury was properly compensable under section 49-2-30 as a scheduled \r\n  loss to an arm.Â  Therrellâ€™s own testimony indicates her injury affected the \r\n  use of her right arm, not her shoulder alone.Â  She described her injury as curtailing \r\n  her ability to use her right hand and armâ€”essentially requiring her to become \r\n  left-hand dominant rather than right-hand dominant as she had been before.Â  \r\n  Moreover, we note Therrellâ€™s treating physician rated her injury as an impairment \r\n  of the â€œright upper extremity.â€Â  \r\nFor these reasons, we find Therrellâ€™s \r\n  injury was properly classified as the â€œloss of use of an armâ€ under section \r\n  42-9-30(13).Â  The ruling of the circuit court affirming the commission is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Section 42-9-30 was amended on February 3, 2004.Â  However, \r\n    the statute in effect at the time of the incident is controlling and governs \r\n    this case.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3844","title":"McGirt v.

Haile (â€œthe \r\n  Estateâ€), appeals the order of the circuit court construing the last will and \r\n  testament of Richard H. Haile, Jr.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Estate brought an action \r\n  in probate court for a declaratory judgment construing the terms of Richardâ€™s \r\n  last will and testament, particularly regarding the proper ownership of Richardâ€™s \r\n  business upon the death of his wife, Bessie.Â  After the case was removed from \r\n  the probate court to the circuit court, the parties submitted the matter for \r\n  adjudication on briefs and joined together in submitting a stipulation of facts.Â  \r\n  Those relevant to the determination of this case are as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Richard executed his last will and testament on \r\n  May 27, 1971.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;\r\n         Richard died testate on December 25, 1976.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Richard was survived by his wife of 40+ years, Bessie, \r\n  and his daughter, Sylvia L. Haile (Sylvia H. Nelson at the time of Richardâ€™s \r\n  death).\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         4.&nbsp;\r\n         Sylvia died testate on September 24, 1996.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         5.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         The last will and testament of Sylvia devised her \r\n  estate to her sons, Richard, Ivan, Anthony, and Don Nelson (collectively, â€œRespondentsâ€).\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         6.&nbsp;\r\n         Bessie died testate on May 26, 2001.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         7.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         The last will and testament of Bessie makes each \r\n  Respondent a $1,000 bequest and devises the rest and residue of her estate to \r\n  Ralph Haile, the un-adopted child of her and Richard.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         8.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         At the time of Richardâ€™s death, he owned an unincorporated \r\n  business known as Haileâ€™s Funeral Home (â€œthe businessâ€), which provided funeral \r\n  services to the public of Kershaw County.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis case hinges on the \r\n  construction of Richardâ€™s last will and testament. The provisions of this document \r\n  relevant to the determination of this case are as follows:\r\n\r\nItem II:Â  I will, devise and bequeath my business to my wife, \r\n  [Bessie], and my daughter, [Sylvia], to share and share alike.\r\nItem III:Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is my desire that Haileâ€™s Funeral Home \r\n  be maintained and operated under the name of Haileâ€™s Funeral Home.\r\nItem IV:Â  In the event my wife, [Bessie], or my daughter, \r\n  [Sylvia], should predecease the other in death, then the survivor shall inherit \r\n  the whole.\r\nItem V:Â  I so direct that my wife, [Bessie], during her life, \r\n  is vested with full discretion in the operation, control and style of [the business] \r\n  and I so direct that my said wife, [Bessie], shall file a written accounting, \r\n  at the beginning of each fiscal year, indicating the profit and expenses of \r\n  the business and at that time pay to my daughter, [Sylvia], her proportionate \r\n  share in accord with her pro rata interest in the business.\r\nItem IX:Â  All the rest and remainder of my estate, both real \r\n  and personal, of whatever kind or nature and wheresoever situated, I will, devise \r\n  and bequeath unto my beloved wife [Bessie], and my beloved daughter, [Sylvia], \r\n  to share and share alike.\r\n\r\nRespondents claim they \r\n  own a one-half interest in the business by way of their motherâ€™s will.Â  The \r\n  Estate claims sole ownership of the business by virtue of Item IV of the will \r\n  and the death of Sylvia before Bessie.Â  The circuit court found Richard Haileâ€™s \r\n  will vested a one-half interest in the funeral home business to each Bessie \r\n  and Sylvia.Â  The court further found that Sylviaâ€™s interest in the business \r\n  was properly transferred to Respondents. The Estate now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis appeal involves stipulated \r\n  and undisputed facts; therefore this court is free to review whether the trial \r\n  court properly applied the law to those facts.Â  WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, \r\n  342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000).Â  We are under no obligation in this \r\n  case to defer to the trial courtâ€™s legal conclusions. See J.K.Constr., \r\n  Inc. v. W. Carolina Regâ€™l Sewer Auth., 336 S.C. 162, 166, 519 S.E.2d 561, \r\n  563 (1999).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe Estate contends the \r\n  lower court erred in construing Richardâ€™s Will, particularly the survivorship \r\n  language in Item IV.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is the cardinal rule \r\n  of will construction that the testatorâ€™s intent should be ascertained and followed \r\n  unless it violates some well-established rule of law. See Peopleâ€™s \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank of Greenville v. Harrison, 198 S.C. 457, 461, 18 S.E.2d 1, 3 \r\n  (1941); Wates v. Fairfield Forest Prods. Co., 210 S.C. 319, 322, 42 S.E.2d \r\n  529, 530 (1947).Â  In ascertaining the testatorâ€™s intent, effect must be given \r\n  to every part of the will. If possible by any reasonable interpretation, â€œall \r\n  clauses must be harmonized with each other and with the will as a whole.â€ Shevlin \r\n  v. Colony Lutheran Church, 227 S.C. 598, 603, 88 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1955).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Richardâ€™s will, the \r\n  business was devised upon his death to Sylvia and Bessie to â€œshare and share \r\n  alike.â€ When read alone, this is an unambiguous and absolute grant of half of \r\n  the business to each.Â  The Estate contends, however, that the language in Item \r\n  IV cut down this absolute grant to either a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, \r\n  a life estate with cross remainder, or a fee simple subject to shifting executory \r\n  interest. [1] Â Â Â  \r\nWhile the language in Item IV contemplates \r\n  the possibility of either Bessie or Sylvia predeceasing the other, we do not \r\n  believe Richard intended this language to cut down the devise of Item II into \r\n  something less than an absolute grant.Â  â€œ[W]here an estate or interest is given \r\n  in words of clear and ascertained legal signification, it shall not be enlarged, \r\n  cut down, or destroyed by superadded words in the same or subsequent clauses, \r\n  unless they raise an irresistible inference that such was the intention.â€Â  Schroder \r\n  v. Antipas, et al., 215 S.C. 552, 556, 56 S.E.2d 354, 355 (1949) (quoting \r\n  Adams, et al. v. Verner, 102 S.C. 7, 11, 86 S.E. 211, 212 (1915)).Â  \r\nâ€œ[A]n estate devised in fee cannot \r\n  by subsequent language be stripped of its legal incidents, and where it \r\n  appears that the controlling intention is to give an absolute estate, subsequent \r\n  language inconsistent therewith must be held ineffective.â€Â  Rogers v. Rogers, \r\n  221 S.C. 360, 368-369, 70 S.E.2d 637, 641 (1952). Â In some circumstances, an \r\n  absolute grant may be cut down by subsequent language in a will.Â  However, this \r\n  subsequent language must be â€œat least as clear in expressing that intention \r\n  as the words in which the interest is given.â€Â  Johnson v. Waldrop, 256 \r\n  S.C. 372, 376, 182 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1971) (quoting Walker v. Alverson, \r\n  87 S.C. 55, 68 S.E. 966 (1910)).Â  Words of doubtful import following a gift \r\n  made in clear and unequivocal terms cannot cut down or qualify that gift.Â  See \r\n  Johnson, 256 S.C. at 376, 182 S.E.2d at 731; Wates v. Fairfield Forest \r\n  Prods. Co., 210 S.C. 319, 322, 42 S.E.2d 529, 530 (1947).Â  \r\nIn reviewing Item IV, it appears \r\n  Richard intended either Bessie or Sylvia to take the business as a sole owner \r\n  should one predecease the other before his death. However, considering the absolute \r\n  grant of Item II, this intent becomes less clear upon the death of Bessie or \r\n  Sylvia after Richardâ€™s death. In this circumstance, the language of Item IV \r\n  constitutes, at the very least, words of doubtful import less clear than the \r\n  original grant.\r\nThe Estate contends that \r\n  the facts and outcome of Johnson are analogous to this case. We find \r\n  this reliance misguided. The will in Johnson devised all of testatorâ€™s \r\n  property to his wife, but later stated that â€œupon the death of [his] wifeâ€ all \r\n  remaining property would be divided between his sister and brother.Â  256 S.C. \r\n  at 374, 182 S.E.2d at 730.Â  The controlling distinction between Johnson \r\n  and the case before this court is that in Johnson the added provision \r\n  was not of doubtful import.Â  The subsequent language in that case clearly contemplates \r\n  the ultimate divestment of the testatorâ€™s property upon the future date of his \r\n  wifeâ€™s death, not the date of his own. Item IV of Richardâ€™s will, however, contains \r\n  no similar reflection of testator intent.Â  \r\nThe issue before this court is one \r\n  of timing. We must decide, considering the will as a whole, at what point Richard \r\n  intended the absolute grant of Item II to vest permanently with his wife and \r\n  daughter.Â  Words concerning the intended time of vesting for a testamentary \r\n  devise usually refer to one of three dates: (1) the date of the will, (2) the \r\n  date of testatorâ€™s death, or (3) the date of the death of a life tenant.Â  See \r\n  Matter of Will of Hall, 318 S.C. 188, 193, 456 S.E.2d 439, 442 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995).Â  As further reflected in Item V, it was Richardâ€™s intent that the devise \r\n  of Item II was to take full possessory effect on the date of his death.Â  It \r\n  is well established in South Carolina that whenever a devise â€œtakes effect in \r\n  possession immediately on testatorâ€™s death, words of survivor-ship [sic] refer \r\n  to the date of testatorâ€™s death and are intended to provide for the contingency \r\n  of the death of the objects of his bounty in his lifetime; unless some other \r\n  point of time be indicated by the will.â€Â  Peecksen et al. v. Peecksen et \r\n  al., 211 S.C. 543, 549, 34 S.E.2d 787, 790 (1945).Â  \r\nAlthough Haileâ€™s will contains words \r\n  of survivorship, it did not clearly indicate the point in time when the words \r\n  of survivorship would take effect.Â  As a result, the rule espoused in Peecksen \r\n  requires construing the words of survivorship to refer to the date of the testatorâ€™s \r\n  death and are only applicable in the event of an heir predeceasing the testator.Â  \r\n  In Johnson, the point of time was clearly indicated by the will; here \r\n  it was not.Â  Moreover, this absence of point in time clarity renders the language \r\n  in Item IV to be of doubtful import, thus not effective in cutting down the \r\n  absolute grant of Item II.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find that Richard \r\n  only intended the survivor of Bessie and Sylvia to inherit the whole business \r\n  if one should predecease the other before his own death.Â  Since this did not \r\n  occur, Sylvia inherited an absolute one-half interest in the business, which \r\n  she transferred to Respondents through her will.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Our analysis is limited to the general issue of whether the testator \r\n    intended any of these to apply.Â  Since any one of these interests would grant \r\n    the Estate present sole ownership of the business, we need not decide which \r\n    might be the most applicable.

Davis, 223 S.C. 182, \r\n    192, 75 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1953).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3845","title":"McCrowey v.

Chadwick Smith, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\nW. Mark White, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kevin McCrowey (â€œAppellantâ€) \r\n  appeals a circuit court ruling sustaining the decision of the Zoning Board of \r\n  Adjustment of Rock Hill (â€œRespondentâ€), which found Appellantâ€™s business to \r\n  be in violation of local zoning ordinances.Â  We affirm.  \r\n  [1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nKevin McCrowey is the owner of \r\n  property (the â€œPropertyâ€) located at 1151 Saluda Street in Rock Hill.Â  On \r\n  March 24, 1998, Appellant submitted an application for a Certificate of Occupancy \r\n  along with a diagram of the building located on the Property.Â  In March 1999, \r\n  Rock Hill granted Appellant a Certificate of Occupancy for the operation of \r\n  a pool hall.Â  \r\nAt the time Appellant submitted the application, \r\n  he was leasing the Property.Â  Appellant later subleased the Property to Carlondo \r\n  Brown, who was granted a Commercial Zoning Permit to operate a game room on \r\n  October 29, 1999.Â  In February 2000, Appellant purchased the Property.Â  On October \r\n  20, 2000 Appellant obtained a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for the operation \r\n  of a sports bar under the name of Infinity 2000 Sports Lounge.Â  \r\nOne of Rock Hillâ€™s inspectors noted on the Application \r\n  for Certificate of Zoning Compliance that the parking lot did not conform to \r\n  the zoning codeâ€™s design standards, as it appeared the Property did not have \r\n  enough parking spaces available to accommodate a nightclub. Â This notation also \r\n  requested the submission of a parking plan for the site.Â  Appellant submitted \r\n  the requested parking plan and an additional notation was later added by Rock \r\n  Hillâ€™s zoning administrator stating that the application was â€œ[a]pproved for \r\n  zoning compliance per plan revised [November 10, 2000].â€Â  \r\nHowever, despite this apparent approval, the same \r\n  zoning administrator who approved Appellantâ€™s parking plan issued a Notice of \r\n  Violation to Appellant on September 6, 2001, which stated that the parking area \r\n  and signs located on the Property were in violation of Rock Hillâ€™s Zoning Code.Â  \r\n  Appellant filed a notice of appeal on September 21, 2001 and a hearing was held \r\n  before the Rock Hill Board of Zoning Appeals (the â€œBoardâ€) on November 20, 2001.Â  \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that he previously found \r\n  Appellantâ€™s parking plan in compliance with the applicable zoning ordinance, \r\n  the zoning administrator stated at the hearing that the Property did not currently, \r\n  nor did it ever, comply with the zoning ordinance since the nightclubs were \r\n  first opened on the property in 1998.Â  On January 11, 2002, the Board issued \r\n  a letter denying Appellantâ€™s appeal and affirming the decision of the zoning \r\n  administrator.Â  \r\nAccordingly on February 8, 2002, Appellant \r\n  appealed the Boardâ€™s decision to the circuit court pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 6-29-820 (Supp. 2002). [2] Â  \r\n  At the hearing before the circuit court, Appellant argued that Respondent should \r\n  be estopped from finding the Property in violation of the zoning ordinances \r\n  based on its earlier conduct.Â  Appellant offered this argument, in part, based \r\n  on the fact that nightclubs have operated on the Property since 1998 without \r\n  incident and all with approval of Respondent.Â  In addition, as noted above, \r\n  the zoning administrator who issued the Notice of Violation previously approved \r\n  Appellantâ€™s parking plan.Â  Therefore, Appellant averred he relied on this past \r\n  conduct to his detriment when he decided to purchase the Property.Â  \r\nRelying on several South Carolina authorities, \r\n  Respondent averred that under the facts of this case, the doctrine of equitable \r\n  estoppel should not be applied.Â  By order dated May 23, 2002, the trial court \r\n  agreed with Respondent and affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nBecause Rock Hill enacted the zoning ordinance \r\n  in question pursuant to the South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning \r\n  Enabling Act of 1994, the scope of review is governed by statute.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6-29-310 â€“ 1200 (Supp. 2002). Accordingly, as stated in Section \r\n  840, â€œ[t]he findings of fact by the board of appeals shall be treated in the \r\n  same manner as a finding of fact by a jury.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840 (Supp. \r\n  2002); see also Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for City of Beaufort, \r\n  346 S.C. 401, 405, 552 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[i]n determining \r\n  the questions presented by the appeal, the court shall determine only whether \r\n  the decision of the board is correct as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.  \r\nIt is important to note â€œ[a] court will \r\n  refrain from substituting its judgment for that of the reviewing body, even \r\n  if it disagrees with the decision.â€Â  Restaurant Row Assocs. v. Horry County, \r\n  335 S.C. 209, 216, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  â€œHowever, \r\n  a decision of a municipal zoning board will be overturned if it is arbitrary, \r\n  capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful purpose, or if the board \r\n  has abused its discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Appellant argues the trial court erred \r\n  in finding the doctrine of equitable estoppel not applicable because the zoning \r\n  administrator erroneously issued a certificate of zoning compliance.Â  We disagree.Â \r\nTypically, equitable estoppel is found \r\n  to exist when the following elements are present:\r\n\r\n(1) [C]onduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false \r\n  representation or concealment of material facts or which is calculated to convey \r\n  the impression that the facts are otherwise than and inconsistent with those \r\n  which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention or at least \r\n  expectation that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; (3) knowledge, \r\n  actual or constructive, of the true facts; (4) lack of knowledge or the means \r\n  of knowledge of the facts by the other party; (5) reliance upon the conduct \r\n  by the other party; and (6) a detrimental change of position by the other party \r\n  because of his reliance. \r\n\r\nOswald v. Aiken County, 281 S.C. 298, 305, 315 S.E.2d \r\n  146, 151 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Frady v. Smith, 247 S.C. 353, 147 S.E.2d \r\n  412 (1966)).\r\n However, it is generally held that â€œ[n]o \r\n  estoppel can grow out of dealings with public officers of limited authority, \r\n  and the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot ordinarily be invoked to defeat \r\n  a municipality in the prosecution of its public affairs because of an error \r\n  or mistake of . . . one of its officers or agents . . . .â€ DeStefano v. City \r\n  of Charleston, 304 S.C. 250, 257-258, 403 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1991) (quoting \r\n  Farrow v. City Council of Charleston, 169 S.C. 373, 382, 168 S.E. 852, \r\n  855 (1933)) (further citations omitted).Â  See also South Carolina \r\n  Coastal Council v. Vogel, 292 S.C. 449, 452, 357 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987) (holding that the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot be used to deprive \r\n  the State of the due exercise of its police power or to frustrate its application \r\n  of public policy).\r\nSignificantly, in spite of this general \r\n  rule, South Carolina courts have held that â€œ[a] governmental body is not immune \r\n  from the application of equitable estoppel where its officers or agents act \r\n  within the proper scope of their authority.â€ Â South Carolina Coastal Council \r\n  v. Vogel, 292 S.C. 449, 453, 357 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing \r\n  Oswald v. Aiken County, 281 S.C. 298, 315 S.E.2d 146 (Ct. App. 1984)).Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough Appellant acknowledges the general \r\n  rule, he argues the zoning administrator was acting within the proper scope \r\n  of his authority, and thus, the doctrine should be applicable.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Appellant avers that in the current case â€œthe Zoning Administrator acted within \r\n  his proper authorityÂ Â  when he concluded that [his] parking area met Rock Hillâ€™s \r\n  zoning requirements.â€Â  The Appellant goes on to state â€œthe decision of whether \r\n  a piece of property conforms to zoning compliance is a determination the zoning \r\n  administrator would appear to have authority to make.â€Â Â  \r\nHowever, the zoning administrator did \r\n  not have the authority to alter or waive the zoning ordinance in question.Â  \r\n  Rock Hillâ€™s Zoning Code gives zoning administrators the power to administer \r\n  and enforce the Zoning Code.Â  Rock Hillâ€™s Zoning Code does not grant power to \r\n  an administrator to alter, modify, or waive provisions contained in the Zoning \r\n  Code.Â  Further, the zoning administrator was not granted with the authority \r\n  to grant a variance.Â  The Zoning Code only grants the Zoning Board of Appeals \r\n  the discretion of whether and when to grant a variance.Â  Because the parties \r\n  do not dispute that the Property did in fact violate the zoning ordinance, the \r\n  zoning administrator exceeded his authority when he approved Appellantâ€™s parking \r\n  plan in October 2000.Â  As the zoning administratorâ€™s actions in approving Appellantâ€™s \r\n  parking plan were in error, the trial court did not err in concluding, based \r\n  on the authority cited above, that equitable estoppel could not be applied to \r\n  frustrate the attempts by Rock Hill to enforce its zoning code as written. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, the decision of the trial \r\n  court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court \r\n    in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument \r\n    pursuant to Rules 215 and 220(b)(2), SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]  \r\n  \r\n  A person who may have a \r\n    substantial interest in any decision of the board of appeals or an officer \r\n    or agent of the appropriate governing authority may appeal from a decision \r\n    of the board to the circuit court in and for the county by filing with the \r\n    clerk of the court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully, and \r\n    distinctly why the decision is contrary to law.Â  The appeal must be filed \r\n    within thirty days after the decision of the board is mailed.\r\n  \r\n  S.C.

Smith, II, of Columbia, for Respondent Sandra \r\n  Hargrove.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Perdue Farms, Inc. appeals \r\n  a Circuit Court order affirming the award of Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits \r\n  to Sandra Hargrove.Â  Perdue argues the Circuit Court erred in ruling substantial \r\n  evidence supported the finding by the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commission that Hargrove aggravated or exacerbated a pre-existing condition \r\n  during the course of her employment at Perdue.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSandra Hargrove is a thirty-six-year-old mother \r\n  of two who resides in Dillon, South Carolina.Â  Hargrove began working at Titan \r\n  Textile Company, d/b/a Dillon Yarn (Dillon Yarn), as an inspector/packer in \r\n  December of 1997.Â  Hargroveâ€™s job at Dillon Yarn required her to remove spools \r\n  of yarn from manufacturing machines and visually inspect the spools before placing \r\n  them on a metal pole protruding from a pushcart.Â  Once the spool was on the \r\n  cart, she would wrap it in plastic and then, using both hands, remove the spool \r\n  from the pole and place it in a box located on the pushcart.Â  Hargrove â€œput \r\n  togetherâ€ fifty or more boxes per day.\r\nA single box can hold any number of spools depending \r\n  on the size of the particular spool being manufactured.Â  When the cart was full, \r\n  Hargrove would push it to a conveyor belt where she would unload the boxes.Â  \r\n  Hargrove testified she made approximately forty or fifty trips per shift to \r\n  the conveyor line.Â  Her supervisor at Dillon Yarn, Effie Peele, estimated Hargrove \r\n  would â€œhandle somewhere between 600 and 800 tubes of yarn per day.â€Â  During \r\n  her time at Dillon Yarn, Hargroveâ€™s work schedule consisted of working eight-hour \r\n  shifts, seven days in a row, having two or sometimes three days off, and then \r\n  working seven more days.\r\nHargrove stated she never experienced problems with \r\n  either of her arms before working at Dillon Yarn.Â  However, about six or seven \r\n  months after her employment at Dillon Yarn began, Hargrove started experiencing \r\n  problems with her left hand and arm, including swelling and numbness.Â  She did \r\n  not seek medical attention or notify her employer when these problems first \r\n  started.Â  She testified she would go home after work and soak her hand and arm \r\n  and then â€œit would be all rightâ€â€”â€œ[t]he pain would go awayâ€ and the â€œswelling \r\n  would go down.â€Â  According to Hargrove, this swelling would occur â€œas much as \r\n  once a month.â€\r\nOn March 1, 2000, Hargrove applied for a position \r\n  working first shift at Perdue Farms, a chicken processing plant.Â  On the medical \r\n  history section of her application, Hargrove was asked if she had ever â€œhad \r\n  pain, numbness, swelling in [her] hands, wrists, arms.â€Â  Hargrove indicated \r\n  that in the past she had problems with â€œsorenessâ€ due to lifting boxes at Dillon \r\n  Yarn.Â  She further noted a history of pain and swelling in her hand and wrist.\r\nPrior to accepting an application, Perdueâ€™s practice \r\n  is to give the applicant a physical to see if the individual can physically \r\n  perform the job.Â  The physical consists of a number of tests specifically tailored \r\n  to the demands of the position being sought.Â  Hargrove was given tests to ascertain \r\n  her grip strength on both the right and left hands, in addition to other tests \r\n  on her hands including the Tinel, Phalen and Finklestein tests.Â  These three \r\n  tests check for numbness and tingling in the hands.Â  The Finklestein test involves \r\n  physically touching the median nerve to check for tingling.\r\nThe Occupational Health Nurse at Perdue, Mary Smith \r\n  Sutherland, declared all tests on Hargrove were negative.Â  Nurse Sutherland \r\n  explained that Hargroveâ€™s testing indicated she had a strong grip in both hands \r\n  and no problem taking any of the tests administered by Perdue.\r\nHargroveâ€™s grip strength was important because \r\n  she was applying for a position in the evisceration department.Â  Nurse Sutherland \r\n  stated that, in the evisceration department, employees have to pull skin off \r\n  of the chickens that are being processed.Â  She said that, although machines \r\n  have already processed the insides of the chickens, employees might have to \r\n  â€œscoopâ€ the remaining entrails from the birdâ€™s insides.Â  Nurse Sutherland professed \r\n  the tasks assigned to an employee in the evisceration department involve repetitive \r\n  work, â€œto some degree.â€\r\nAfter Hargrove passed the physical, Perdue hired \r\n  her to work in the evisceration department.Â  Hargrove began her employment with \r\n  Perdue on March 13, 2000. [1] Â  The first week consisted of \r\n  orientation.Â  Nurse Sutherland testified Hargrove worked 25.61 hours her first \r\n  week.Â  The first day of her employment consisted of classroom training for the \r\n  entire day.Â  On each remaining day of her first week, Hargrove spent four hours \r\n  in the classroom and four hours on a training line.Â  Both Nurse Sutherland \r\n  and Hargrove testified that new employees could move more slowly on a training \r\n  line than on a regular line.\r\nHargrove worked 23.18 hours her second week.Â  Unlike \r\n  the previous week, she did not have any classroom training and spent all of \r\n  her time on a regular line, which processed 2,000 to 5,000 chickens each day.Â  \r\n  Hargrove stated that although she was on a regular line, she did not move as \r\n  fast as other employees.Â  She declared that her job during this week consisted \r\n  of pulling the skin off of chickens and removing the remaining entrails from \r\n  the processed chickens.\r\nOn or around March 16, 2000, having finished her \r\n  shift at Perdue, Hargrove informed Peele, her supervisor at Dillon Yarn, that \r\n  she was experiencing pain in her left wrist and arm.Â  Hargrove did not tell \r\n  Peele she believed the problems with her arm were work-related and Peele did \r\n  not ask if they were.Â  According to Peele, this was the first time Hargrove \r\n  complained of pain in her hand and arm.Â  Hargrove made similar complaints to \r\n  Peele on at least two more occasions, although Peele did not keep a record of \r\n  the complaints.Â  Peele indicated Hargroveâ€™s â€œjob was repetitive.â€\r\nOn March 23, 2000, Hargrove worked her shift at \r\n  Perdue.Â  She testified that, after performing her usual job on the evisceration \r\n  line for a short time, the line went down and she was instructed to work in \r\n  the box room.Â  Her duties there consisted of retrieving the boxes others were \r\n  assembling in the room.Â  When her shift was over, Hargrove went to work her \r\n  second-shift position at Dillon Yarn.\r\nAfter clocking in, but before working, Hargrove \r\n  noticed a funny feeling in the fingers on her left hand.Â  Hargrove declared \r\n  that nothing happened to her hand or arm between the time she left Perdue and \r\n  the time she arrived at Dillon Yarn that would explain the problems she began \r\n  having.\r\nHargrove stated she went to Dillon Yarnâ€™s nurse, \r\n  Joyce Harmon, and â€œasked [Harmon] about the funny feeling in [her] fingers.â€Â  \r\n  Hargrove requested something for pain.Â  The nurse gave Hargrove some Tylenol \r\n  and then Hargrove went to work as usual.Â  As she was performing her normal duties, \r\n  Hargrove picked up a tube and it fell from her grasp.Â  She testified that after \r\n  she dropped the tube she looked down at her left hand and noticed it was swollen.Â  \r\n  Hargrove went to her supervisor and asked if she could be excused to go see \r\n  a doctor.Â  She was given permission and went to see her family physician, Dr. \r\n  Michael Brown, the next day, March 24.\r\nIn his medical report, Dr. Brown noted: â€œHas tenderness \r\n  over the extensor surface left hand and also at base of the thumb.â€Â  Dr. Brown \r\n  x-rayed the hand, placed it in a splint, and prescribed medication.Â  He wrote \r\n  Hargrove an excuse from work for a few days.\r\nOn March 27, 2000, Hargrove went to the medical \r\n  department at Perdue to provide Dr. Brownâ€™s letter excusing her from work.Â  \r\n  Nurse Sutherland professed she did not ask Hargrove whether the injury was work-related \r\n  because she did not feel Hargrove had worked at Perdue long enough to have experienced \r\n  an injury there.Â  Nevertheless, Nurse Sutherland reviewed Hargroveâ€™s file and \r\n  sent her to Perdueâ€™s company physician, Dr. Phil Wallace. [2] \r\nDr. Wallaceâ€™s report, dated March 27, 2000, indicates \r\n  Hargroveâ€™s left wrist and hand showed â€œslight swelling.â€Â  He diagnosed â€œprobable \r\n  mild tendonitisâ€ and modified her activities for two weeks.Â  The report demonstrates \r\n  that Dr. Wallace â€œadvised [Hargrove] she probably needs to pick one or the other \r\n  jobâ€ because he did not â€œthink she [could] physically handle both.â€Â  Dr. Wallace \r\n  noted, under a section in the report subtitled â€œADD,â€ that he â€œ[t]alked with \r\n  Perdue, felt this was not probably W/C, situation where she is using too much \r\n  work in both _____.â€Â  Regarding this particular notation, the Single Commissioner \r\n  concluded:\r\n\r\nThe report does speak for itself.Â  A.D.D., I believe, based \r\n  on reading medical reports stands for addendum.Â  Meaning this is after he talked \r\n  with Perdue he added this.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nWell, he doesnâ€™t say in the addendum [what his opinion is].Â  \r\n  He says â€œtalked with Perdue.Â  Felt this was probably [not] W.C. situation where \r\n  sheâ€™s using too much work in both something.Â  They both agreed to give herâ€â€”he \r\n  doesnâ€™t say that thisâ€”whether this was his.Â  It looks to me like, â€œtalked with \r\n  Perdue.Â  Felt this was not probably W.C. like Perdue was saying it wasnâ€™t Workersâ€™ \r\n  Comp.\r\n\r\nDr. Wallace issued excuses from work, which Hargrove \r\n  took to both Dillon Yarn and Perdue. \r\n  [3] Â  On Hargroveâ€™s visit to Dillon Yarn, Harmon, the plant nurse, gave \r\n  her a long-term disability form to complete.Â  Hargrove testified she completed \r\n  the form and sent it to Dr. Wallace.Â  Harmon stated she talked to Dr. Wallace \r\n  and received the disability form back from him, which indicated Hargroveâ€™s problems \r\n  with her arm were work-related.Â  In response to the question on the form whether \r\n  the condition was â€œdue to injury or sickness arising out of patientâ€™s employment,â€ \r\n  Dr. Wallace checked the box after â€œYes.â€\r\nOn April 5, 2000, after noting Hargrove was continuing \r\n  to have pain and limitation of movement in her wrist, Dr. Wallace referred her \r\n  to Dr. Dwight Jacobus.Â  Dr. Jacobus, an orthopedic surgeon, is one of Perdueâ€™s \r\n  approved doctors for injuries that are work-related.Â  Dr. Jacobus first saw \r\n  Hargrove on April 7, 2000.Â  He testified that his â€œinitial impression, after \r\n  [he] took a history and physical, was that of a possible carpal tunnel syndrome \r\n  as it related to her left upper extremity.â€Â  Dr. Jacobus saw Hargrove on at \r\n  least four occasions and performed a number of tests and diagnostic studies \r\n  to determine the root cause of her problems.Â  Dr. Jacobus noted Hargrove continued \r\n  to experience pain and swelling in her left hand.Â  In a medical record dated \r\n  May 15, 2000, Dr. Jacobus stated: â€œI still find no specific clinical abnormality \r\n  other than some changes that possibly might represent an early reflex sympathetic \r\n  dystrophy.Â  I think a 2nd opinion is important and I have convinced her of that.â€\r\nOn January 18, 2001, Dr. Jacobus wrote a letter \r\n  to Hargroveâ€™s attorney which declared: â€œIt would be my opinion that the symptoms \r\n  related to the left upper extremity were most probably caused and aggravated \r\n  by repetitive activities related to her work.â€Â  In a later deposition, Dr. Jacobus \r\n  reaffirmed this opinion.Â  In fact, he specifically opined that Hargroveâ€™s \r\n  (1) â€œlong-term repetitious activitiesâ€ at Dillon Yarn â€œwould have been the activities \r\n  that instituted the changes leading to the diagnosis or at least the symptoms \r\n  of carpal tunnel syndromeâ€; and (2) â€œsecondary job responsibilities of stripping \r\n  chicken skinâ€ at Perdue â€œwould therefore possibly . . . exacerbate the symptoms \r\n  that were instituted by the initial employee responsibilities.â€\r\nBecause Hargrove was still complaining of pain \r\n  and discomfort, Dr. Jacobus felt it prudent to seek a second opinion.Â  Thus, \r\n  Hargrove was referred to Dr. Robert W. Moore, a physician in Florence, who specializes \r\n  in upper extremity problems.Â  Dr. Moore diagnosed Hargrove with reflex \r\n  sympathetic dystrophy in her left hand.Â  He suggested that Hargrove participate \r\n  in pain management, as well as hand therapy and several other treatments.Â  A \r\n  series of epidural blocks was performed.Â  Hargrove stated these treatments were \r\n  not helpful.\r\nResponding to a letter from Hargroveâ€™s attorney, \r\n  Dr. Moore stated in a letter dated January 3, 2001, that it was his â€œopinion \r\n  that [Hargroveâ€™s] problem was not caused by the repetitive activities she performed \r\n  at Dillon Yarn.â€Â  Unable to make much progress towards Hargroveâ€™s improvement, \r\n  Dr. Moore referred Hargrove to Dr. James A. Nunley at the Duke University Medical \r\n  Center.Â  Dr. Nunley agreed that it â€œlooks like she does in fact have \r\n  reflex sympathetic dystrophy.â€Â  He noted she â€œshows the skin changes, the swelling.â€Â  \r\n  Dr. Nunley suggested Hargrove be referred to Dr. L. Andrew Koman at Bowman Gray \r\n  Medical School Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Clinic.Â  Hargrove testified she \r\n  did not go to Bowman Gray.\r\nOn July 19, 2000, Hargrove filed a Form 50 seeking \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits against Dillon Yarn alleging repetitive trauma \r\n  as the cause of her injuries.Â  Hargrove asserted that â€œ[d]ue to injury, the \r\n  claimant is in need of . . . medical examination and treatment for carpal tunnel \r\n  syndrome.â€Â  Dillon Yarn denied Hargrove was entitled to benefits.Â  Dillon Yarn \r\n  then moved to add Perdue as a co-defendant.Â  Perdue was joined as a party by \r\n  order dated December 14, 2001.Â  Both Dillon Yarn and Perdue claimed the injuries, \r\n  if work-related, happened when Hargrove was working for the other.\r\nIn her order, the Single Commissioner found the \r\n  following facts:\r\n\r\n1.Â  Claimant sustained compensable injuries by accident \r\n  arising out of and in the course of her employment on March 23, 2000 with both \r\n  employers.\r\n2.Â  The employment with Dillon Yarn (Titan Textile) caused \r\n  claimantâ€™s carpal tunnel syndrome.\r\n3.Â  Claimantâ€™s employment with Perdue exacerbated her condition.\r\n4.Â  The last date of injurious exposure occurred while the \r\n  employment relationship existed concurrently.\r\n5.Â  It would be unfair to have one employer accept 100% \r\n  liability under a theory of last date of injurious exposure when the difference \r\n  in the last work dateâ€”not employment dateâ€”was only a matter of hours and included \r\n  a weekend.Â  Consideration is given also to the work schedule and how it may \r\n  have figured into dates worked.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner concluded: â€œPursuant to Section \r\n  42-1-160, claimant sustained compensable injuries by accident on March 23, 2000 \r\n  with both employers.â€Â  The Commissioner ruled that Hargrove was entitled to \r\n  temporary total disability as well as payment of medical expenses, to be split \r\n  evenly between the employers.\r\nBoth employers appealed this decision to an Appellate \r\n  Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Appellate \r\n  Panel).Â  The Appellate Panel issued an order unanimously affirming the ruling \r\n  of the Single Commissioner in its entirety:\r\n\r\nAfter careful review in the instant case, the Appellate Panel \r\n  has determined that all of the Hearing Commissionerâ€™s Findings of Fact and Rulings \r\n  of Law are correct as stated.Â  We find that such Findings of Fact and Conclusions \r\n  of Law are hereby included in this Order by reference . . . .Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set forth in the single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  Order shall become, and hereby are, the law of the case; and, therefore, the \r\n  Order is sustained in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe employers appealed the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision \r\n  to the Circuit Court.Â  The Circuit Court issued a form order affirming the decision.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the Circuit Court found: â€œThere is substantial evidence to support \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s order and therefore it is affirmed.â€Â  Perdue appealed \r\n  the Circuit Courtâ€™s order to this Court. [4] \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Commission.Â  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, \r\n  276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. \r\n  510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify \r\n  a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions \r\n  of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and \r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Health and Envtl. Control, Op. No. 3813 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 1, \r\n  2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 24 at 47); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court \r\n  may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight \r\n  of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is \r\n  affected by an error of law.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. \r\n  520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 \r\n  S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs \r\n  the standard of review in a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision.Â  Frame, 357 \r\n  S.C. at 527, 593 S.E.2d at 494; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 \r\n  S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled \r\n  by some error of law.Â  See Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 728-29; see also Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, \r\n  434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting that in reviewing decision of Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Commission, Court of Appeals will not set aside its findings unless \r\n  they are not supported by substantial evidence or they are controlled by error \r\n  of law).\r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of \r\n  evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is \r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds \r\n  to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify \r\n  its action.Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 \r\n  S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder \r\n  in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact.Â  Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729; Muir \r\n  v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final \r\n  determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence \r\n  is reserved to the Appellate Panel.Â  See Shealy v. Aiken County, \r\n  341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 \r\n  S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995); Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at \r\n  729.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \r\n  does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by \r\n  substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 \r\n  S.E.2d 102 (1999); Muir, 336 S.C. at 282, 519 S.E.2d at 591.Â  Where there \r\n  are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate \r\n  Panel are conclusive.Â  Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 455, 562 S.E.2d at 681.\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed \r\n  correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\n  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks \r\n  v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999).Â  It \r\n  is not within our province to reverse findings of the Appellate Panel which \r\n  are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 \r\n  S.E.2d at 637.Â  The appellate court is prohibited from overturning findings \r\n  of fact of the Appellate Panel, unless there is no reasonable probability the \r\n  facts could be as related by the witness upon whose testimony the finding was \r\n  based.Â  Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 455-56, 562 S.E.2d at 681.\r\nIn the current case, after â€œcareful review,â€ the \r\n  Appellate Panel found â€œthat all of the Hearing Commissionerâ€™s Findings of Fact \r\n  and Rulings of Law [were] correct as stated.â€Â  Thus, the Appellate Panel adopted \r\n  the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of law by reference into \r\n  its final order as it is entitled to do under sections 1-23-350 and 42-17-40 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-350 (1986) &amp; \r\n  42-17-40 (Supp. 2003); see also Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., \r\n  355 S.C. 154, 584 S.E.2d 390 (Ct. App. 2003) (interpreting these statutory provisions \r\n  and concluding the Appellate Panel meets the requirements contained therein \r\n  when it incorporates a Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of \r\n  law by reference into its order).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPerdueâ€™s sole argument on appeal is that \r\n  the Circuit Court erred in finding the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision was supported \r\n  by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Pee v. AVM\r\nPerdue claims Hargrove did not attribute \r\n  her injury to her work at Perdue.Â  Perdue contends Hargrove â€œwas able to identify \r\n  a specific incident on March 23, 2000 at Dillon Yarn which caused an acute aggravation \r\n  of her underlying condition.â€Â  However, as Perdue acknowledges, it is \r\n  not necessary for a claimant to identify a specific precipitating event in order \r\n  for the claimant to be entitled to benefits.Â  Our Supreme Court addressed this \r\n  issue in Pee v. AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167, 573 S.E.2d 785 (2002):\r\n\r\nEmployer contends a repetitive trauma injury does not qualify \r\n  as an â€œinjury by accidentâ€ because the cause of the injury is not unexpected \r\n  and the injury lacks definiteness of time. . . . .\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nAs we more recently stated, â€œin determining whether \r\n  something constitutes an injury by accident the focus is not on some specific \r\n  event, but rather on the injury itself.â€Â  Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, \r\n  306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991).Â  Further, an injury is unexpected, \r\n  bringing it within the category of accident, if the worker did not intend it \r\n  or expect it would result from what he was doing.Â  Colvin [v. E.I.

For instance, \r\n  in Sturkie v. Ballenger Corp., 268 S.C. 536, 235 S.E.2d 120 (1977), we \r\n  found the claimantâ€™s emphysema, which developed gradually, was caused by repeated \r\n  exposure to high humidity and dust on the job and was therefore compensable \r\n  as an injury by accident.Â  Similarly, in Stokes, supra, we found \r\n  a psychological disorder which developed over a period of months compensable \r\n  as an injury by accident.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nHere, it is uncontested that Claimantâ€™s carpal tunnel syndrome \r\n  was caused by her work activities.Â  The lack of a definite time of injury is \r\n  therefore not dispositive.\r\n\r\nPee, 352 S.C. at 170-72, 573 S.E.2d at 787-88 \r\n  (footnote omitted).Â  Whether Hargrove could identify a precipitating event is \r\n  irrelevant in determining if she is entitled to benefits.\r\nPerdue maintains Hargrove exonerated the company \r\n  when she stated that nothing unusual happened to her arm while she was working \r\n  there and that she never experienced pain and swelling in her hand after working \r\n  at Perdue.Â  Yet, this testimony does not provide a full account of the evidence \r\n  presented on the issue.Â  Hargrove testified that on March 23, 2000, after working \r\n  a full shift at Perdue, she went to her second-shift job at Dillon Yarn.Â  She \r\n  declared that after she clocked in, but before beginning her shift, she began \r\n  experiencing a funny feeling in the fingers of her left hand.Â Â Â  Furthermore, \r\n  her supervisor at Dillon Yarn professed Hargrove never complained about experiencing \r\n  problems with her arms or hands prior to her beginning the job at Perdue.Â  Thus, \r\n  the evidence clearly shows Hargrove had problems with her left hand and arm \r\n  after working at Perdue.\r\nPerdue gives credence to the fact that Hargrove \r\n  did not work full time her first two weeks at Perdue.Â  Hargrove worked 25.61 \r\n  hours her first week at Perdue and 23.18 hours the second week.Â  Although the \r\n  entire first day consisted of classroom training, for the remainder of her days \r\n  the first week, Hargrove spent four hours in class and four hours performing \r\n  her normal job, which consisted of pulling the skin off of chickens and removing \r\n  their entrails.Â  Hargrove testified she spent the majority of her time the second \r\n  week on a regular line, which processed anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 chickens \r\n  per day.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Jacobus concluded Hargroveâ€™s â€œlong-term repetitious \r\n  activitiesâ€ at Dillon Yarn caused the carpal tunnel syndrome and her job at \r\n  Perdue â€œpossibly . . . exacerbate[d]â€ the problems.Â  Concomitantly, there is \r\n  substantial evidence in the record that Hargroveâ€™s activities while working \r\n  for Perdue exacerbated her condition.\r\nII.Â  Dr. Jacobus\r\nAfter providing a summary of the evidence presented, \r\n  the Single Commissioner made specific findings of fact, including that Hargroveâ€™s \r\n  employment with Dillon Yarn caused her carpal tunnel syndrome and her employment \r\n  with Perdue exacerbated the condition.Â  Perdue avers the Single Commissioner \r\n  misinterpreted Dr. Jacobusâ€™ testimony.Â  Specifically, Perdue asserts the Single \r\n  Commissioner erred when she noted in her order that Dr. Jacobus â€œstated that \r\n  both jobs would have exacerbated her problem.â€\r\nThe disputed testimony arose as a result of a hypothetical \r\n  question posed by Hargroveâ€™s attorney.Â  The question followed the chain of events \r\n  in Hargroveâ€™s case, but inaccurately suggested Hargrove spent one entire week \r\n  in orientation followed by two weeks of performing her normal job.Â  The attorney \r\n  then asked Dr. Jacobus if he had an opinion as to which job would most likely \r\n  be the cause of Hargroveâ€™s problem.Â  Dr. Jacobus responded:\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be my opinion that the long-term repetitious \r\n  activities, as I believe you related with her first job activities would have \r\n  been the activities that instituted the changes leading to the diagnosis or \r\n  at least the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  The secondary job responsibilities \r\n  of stripping chicken skin, as I perceive that to be, would therefore possibly \r\n  exacerbateâ€”exacerbate the symptoms that were instituted by the initial employee \r\n  responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first or only time Dr. Jacobus indicated \r\n  he considered Hargroveâ€™s injuries to be work-related.Â  In a letter dated January \r\n  18, 2001, Dr. Jacobus stated: â€œIt would be my opinion that the symptoms related \r\n  to the left upper extremity were most probably caused and aggravated by repetitive \r\n  activities related to her work.â€\r\nExpert medical testimony is designed to aid the Appellate \r\n  Panel in coming to the correct conclusion.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., \r\n  336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); Tiller v. National Health Care Ctr., \r\n  334 S.C. 333, 513 S.E.2d 843 (1999).Â  Therefore, the Appellate Panel determines \r\n  the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.Â  Tiller, 334 \r\n  S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 \r\n  S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Once admitted, expert testimony is to be considered \r\n  just like any other testimony.Â  Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at \r\n  846; Corbin, 351 S.C. at 624, 571 S.E.2d at 98.\r\nâ€œIf a medical expert is unwilling to state with certainty \r\n  a connection between an accident and an injury, the â€˜expression of a cautious \r\n  opinionâ€™ may support an award if there are facts outside the medical testimony \r\n  that also support an award.â€Â  Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at \r\n  846.Â  Thus, if medical expert testimony is not solely relied upon to establish \r\n  causation, the fact finder must look to the facts and circumstances of the case.Â  \r\n  Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 846.Â  Proof that a claimant sustained an injury \r\n  may be established by circumstantial and direct evidence where circumstances \r\n  lead an unprejudiced mind to reasonably infer the injury was caused by the accident.Â  \r\n  Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 846-47.Â  However, such evidence need not reach \r\n  such a degree of certainty as to exclude every reasonable or possible conclusion \r\n  other than that reached by the Commission.Â  Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at \r\n  847.\r\nAlthough medical testimony is entitled to great respect, \r\n  the fact finder may disregard it if there is other competent evidence in the \r\n  record.Â  See Tiller, 334 S.C. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846 (stating \r\n  that medical testimony should not be held conclusive irrespective of other evidence).Â  \r\n  In deciding whether substantial evidence supports a finding of causation, it \r\n  is appropriate to consider both the lay and expert evidence.Â  Sharpe, \r\n  336 S.C. at 161, 519 S.E.2d at 106.\r\nNeither the Single Commissioner nor the Appellate \r\n  Panel erred in relying on the testimony of Dr. Jacobus.Â  The subtle differences \r\n  posed in the hypothetical question, compared to the actual events, merely affect \r\n  the weight of the doctorâ€™s testimony and not its validity.\r\nIII.Â  Aggravation \r\n  of Pre-Existing Condition\r\nPerdue asserts â€œDr. Jacobus said nothing about \r\n  any permanent injury being caused by her employment at Perdue.Â  He only speculated \r\n  about an aggravation of symptoms.â€\r\nA work-related accident which aggravates \r\n  or accelerates a pre-existing condition, infirmity, or disease is compensable.Â  \r\n  Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C. 272, 353 S.E.2d 280 (1987); Sturkie \r\n  v.

App. 1995).Â  A \r\n  condition is compensable unless it is due solely to the natural progression \r\n  of a pre-existing condition.Â  Mullinax, 318 S.C. at 437, 458 S.E.2d at \r\n  80.Â  It is no defense that the accident, standing alone, would not have caused \r\n  the claimantâ€™s condition, because the employer takes the employee as it finds \r\n  him or her.Â  Id.Â  â€œ[A]ggravation of a pre-existing condition is compensable \r\n  where disability is continued for a longer time, even though no disability would \r\n  normally have resulted from the injury alone, or even if the aggravation would \r\n  have caused no injury to an employee who was not afflicted with the condition.â€Â  \r\n  Id. (internal quotations omitted).\r\nWhen a pre-existing condition or disease is accelerated \r\n  or aggravated by injury or accident â€œarising out of and in the course of the \r\n  employment,â€ the resulting disability is a compensable injury.Â  Brown, \r\n  291 S.C. at 275, 353 S.E.2d at 282; Arnold v. Benjamin Booth Co., 257 \r\n  S.C. 337, 185 S.E.2d 830 (1971); see also Sturkie, 268 S.C. at \r\n  541, 235 S.E.2d at 122 (exacerbation of pre-existing disease or injury arising \r\n  out of or in course of employment is compensable).\r\nThe right of a claimant to compensation for aggravation \r\n  of a pre-existing condition arises only where there is a dormant condition which \r\n  has produced no disability but which becomes disabling by reason of the aggravating \r\n  injury.Â  Hines v. Pacific Mills, 214 S.C. 125, 51 S.E.2d 383 (1949).Â  \r\n  A determination of whether a claimantâ€™s condition was accelerated or aggravated \r\n  by an accidental injury is a factual matter for the Appellate Panel.Â  Brown, \r\n  291 S.C. at 275, 353 S.E.2d at 282.Â  Where there is a conflict in the evidence \r\n  from the same or different witnesses, the Panelâ€™s findings of fact may not be \r\n  set aside.Â  Id.\r\nIV.Â  Substantial \r\n  Evidence to Support Decision of Appellate Panel\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the record, we find \r\n  substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling.Â  Hargroveâ€™s supervisor \r\n  at Dillon Yarn testified Hargrove never complained about problems with her hand \r\n  or arm prior to beginning her employment with Perdue.Â  Although Hargrove experienced \r\n  problems with her hand and arm before working at Perdue, she said she would \r\n  go home after work and soak her hand and arm and then â€œit would be all rightâ€â€”â€œ[t]he \r\n  pain would go awayâ€ and the â€œswelling would go down.â€\r\n On March 1, 2000, Hargrove applied for her position \r\n  at Perdue.Â  At that time, she was given a physical specifically designed for \r\n  the rigors of the job for which she was applying.Â  Several of the tests were \r\n  aimed at detecting problems with her arms and/or hands.Â  Nurse Sutherland testified \r\n  Hargrove passed all the tests with no problems and possessed a strong grip in \r\n  both hands.\r\nOn March 16, 2000, after completing her shift at \r\n  Perdue, Hargrove complained to her supervisor at Dillon Yarn for the first time \r\n  that her hand and arm were giving her problems.Â  On March 23, 2000, Hargrove \r\n  finished her shift at Perdue and was clocking in at Dillon Yarn when she noticed \r\n  a funny feeling in the fingers on her left hand.Â  At the time this â€œfunny feelingâ€ \r\n  began, Hargrove had not yet started her work duties for the day at Dillon Yarn.Â  \r\n  Later that night, Hargroveâ€™s arm became swollen and she asked if she could be \r\n  excused to go see a doctor.\r\nOn March 27, 2000, Hargrove was sent to Dr. Wallace, \r\n  who opined that he did not â€œthink she [could] physically handle both [jobs].â€Â  \r\n  Dr. Wallace referred Hargrove to Dr. Jacobus, who expressed the opinion that \r\n  her condition was indeed work-related.\r\nIn deciding whether substantial evidence exists, it is appropriate \r\n  to consider both the lay and expert evidence.Â  See Sharpe v. Case \r\n  Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999).Â  Although there is evidence \r\n  from which the Appellate Panel could have gone the other way, there is clearly \r\n  evidence which would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Panel \r\n  reached.Â  Substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Hargroveâ€™s \r\n  work at Perdue aggravated or exacerbated her pre-existing condition.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find substantial evidence supports the \r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s order.Â  The Circuit Court did not err in affirming this decision.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the Circuit Courtâ€™s ruling is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, J., concurs.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  \r\n  This appeal presents the question of whether substantial evidence supports the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s finding that Sandra Hargroveâ€™s nine-day tenure at Perdue Farms \r\n  â€“ comprised entirely of orientation, training and light work â€“ exacerbated a \r\n  condition caused by her long-time employment at Dillon Yarn.Â  Having carefully \r\n  considered the record and applicable standard of review, I would reverse based \r\n  on my conclusion that the Commissionâ€™s finding that Hargrove aggravated her \r\n  pre-existing condition in the course of her brief employment at Perdue Farms \r\n  is not supported by substantial evidence.Â  In my judgment, the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  decision rests solely on speculation.\r\nHargroveâ€™s condition undisputedly \r\n  originated from her work at Dillon Yarn, where she was employed periodically \r\n  from 1992 through March 23, 2000.Â  Neither Hargrove nor Dillon Yarn dispute \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s finding that Hargroveâ€™s condition was caused by her employment \r\n  with Dillon Yarn.Â  Thus, this finding is the law of the case.Â  See \r\n  Unisun Ins. v. Hawkins, 342 S.C. 537, 544, 537 S.E.2d 559, 563 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000) (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the case which the appellate \r\n  court must assume was correct).Â  Hargrove worked eight-hour shifts at Dillon \r\n  Yarn, during which she would lift, bag, and box between 600 and 800 spools of \r\n  yarn from a texturing machine.\r\nOn March 13, 2000, Hargrove began her brief tenure \r\n  with Perdue Farms, while continuing to work full-time at Dillon Yarn.Â  Hargrove \r\n  worked only 25.61 hours in her first of two weeks as an employee of Perdue Farms.Â  \r\n  Her first day of employment at Perdue Farms was entirely devoted to orientation \r\n  and classroom training.Â  On the remaining four days of her first week, Hargrove \r\n  spent four hours each day receiving additional classroom training and four hours \r\n  each day on a special production line used to train new employees.Â  The training \r\n  line moved at half the speed of the normal production lines.Â  Hargrove would \r\n  rotate between functions throughout the day rather than doing one thing repetitively \r\n  all day.Â  According to Hargrove, the work using her hands did not involve â€œany \r\n  real effort.â€\r\nDuring Hargroveâ€™s second week at Perdue Farms, \r\n  she worked 23.18 hours over a four-day period.Â  She continued to work at a training \r\n  line until fourth day, March 23, 2000, when the line went down.Â  Although she \r\n  â€œdidnâ€™t do much that dayâ€ at Perdue Farms, Hargrove did help move empty boxes.Â  \r\n  Later that same day, Hargrove went to her job at Dillon Yarn, where she complained \r\n  to her supervisor that her left hand was â€œswollen,â€ â€œfeeling funny,â€ and had \r\n  â€œstarted hurting.â€Â  The supervisor sent her to the plantâ€™s nurse, who gave Hargrove \r\n  Tylenol.Â  Hargrove completed her shift, but later went to a physician for additional \r\n  treatment.Â  Upon the physicianâ€™s recommendation,Â  Hargrove did not return to \r\n  work at Dillon Yarn or Perdue Farms.Â  She later brought the present action, \r\n  seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits from Dillon Yarn.Â  Dillon Yarn joined \r\n  Perdue Farms as a defendant.Â  \r\nIn deposition testimony, the following exchange \r\n  occurred between Dillon Yarnâ€™s counsel and Hargrove:\r\n\r\n[Counsel]:Â  Did the fingers on your left hand feel funny \r\n  while you were working at Perdue [on March 23, 2000]?\r\n[Hargrove]:&nbsp; No sir.\r\n\r\nWhen Dillon Yarnâ€™s counsel asked Hargrove whether \r\n  she had â€œever felt that funny feeling before,â€ Hargrove responded, â€œThe only \r\n  time I felt that is like when I worked hard at Dillon Yarn.â€Â  When questioned \r\n  as to whether she had any knowledge of an incident or accident at Perdue Farms \r\n  related to her condition, she responded, â€œNo, sir.â€\r\nDr. Dwight Jacobus, a general orthopedic \r\n  surgeon who served as one of Hargroveâ€™s treating physicians, provided additional \r\n  deposition testimony.Â  During the deposition, a hypothetical question posed \r\n  to Dr. Jacobus solicited his opinion regarding which of Hargroveâ€™s jobs had \r\n  caused her condition, or whether the condition was caused by â€œa combination \r\n  of the twoâ€ jobs.Â  In pertinent part, the hypothetical was premised on the false \r\n  assumption that Hargroveâ€™s employment at Perdue Farms consisted of â€œone week \r\n  of training and two weeks of actually performing the job.â€Â  Jacobus opined that \r\n  the long-term, repetitive nature of her job at Dillon Yarn â€œwould have been \r\n  the activities that instituted the changes leading to the diagnosis or at least \r\n  the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.â€Â  He added that the â€œsecondary job responsibilities \r\n  of stripping chicken [at Perdue Farms], as I perceive that to be, would therefore \r\n  possibly exacerbate â€¦ symptoms that were instituted by the initial responsibilities \r\n  [at Dillon Yarn.]â€Â  (emphasis added).\r\nThe order of the single commissioner erroneously \r\n  stated that Dr. Jacobus opined that Hargroveâ€™s â€œleft upper extremity problems \r\n  were most probably caused and aggravated by her work â€¦ [and] â€¦ both jobs \r\n  would have exacerbated her problem.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The commissioner concluded \r\n  that Hargroveâ€™s work at Perdue exacerbated her pre-existing condition.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the commissioner ordered Dillon Yarn and Perdue Farms to each pay one-half of \r\n  the temporary total disability benefits awarded Hargrove, as well as charges \r\n  for all past, present, and continuing medical expenses related to the injury.Â  \r\n  An appellate panel of the Commission affirmed, adopting all of the single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  findings.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Commission.\r\nI recognize that in workersâ€™ compensation cases, \r\n  compensation may be awarded although â€œa medical expert is unwilling to state \r\n  with certainty a connection between an accident and an injury â€¦ â€˜if there are \r\n  facts outside the medical testimony that also support an award.â€™â€Â  Tiller \r\n  v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999), \r\n  citing Grice v. Dickerson, Inc., 241 S.C. 225, 127 S.E.2d 722 (1962).Â  \r\n  This court applied this principle in Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. \r\n  266, 287, 519 S.E.2d 583, 594 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œIf a medical expert is unwilling \r\n  to state with certainty a connection between an accident and an injury, the \r\n  â€˜expression of a cautious opinionâ€™ may support an award if there are facts outside \r\n  the medical testimony that also support an awardâ€).Â  Here, the Commission relied \r\n  solely on the testimony of Dr. Jacobus in finding that Hargroveâ€™s employment \r\n  at Perdue Farms exacerbated her condition.Â  The Commission adopted the single \r\n  commissionerâ€™s finding that Dr. Jacobus opined that Hargroveâ€™s condition was \r\n  â€œmost probablyâ€ exacerbated by both of her jobs.Â  Dr. Jacobus rendered no such \r\n  opinion, as he only testified that Hargroveâ€™s work at Perdue Farms â€œpossibly \r\n  exacerbate[d]â€ symptoms of the condition caused by her work at Dillon Yarn.Â  \r\n  At best, Dr. Jacobus provided an â€œexpression of a cautious opinionâ€ with respect \r\n  to the relationship between Hargroveâ€™s condition and her work at Perdue Farms.Â  \r\n  There is no additional evidence, lay or otherwise, supporting an award against \r\n  Perdue Farms.Â  In fact, Hargroveâ€™s testimony refutes any suggestion or inference \r\n  of a connection between her injury and her nine-day employment at Perdue Farms, \r\n  which she conceded did not involve â€œany real effort.â€Â  â€œWorkersâ€™ compensation \r\n  awards must not be based on surmise, conjecture or speculation.â€ Tiller, \r\n  334 S.C. at 339, 513 S.E.2d at 845.Â  \r\nI reach this conclusion fully cognizant of the \r\n  deferential substantial evidence standard of review applicable to appeals from \r\n  the Commission.Â  Consistent with this deferential standard of review, an appellate \r\n  court must nevertheless ensure the record contains some evidence beyond a mere \r\n  scintilla which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds \r\n  to concur in the conclusion reached by the Commission.Â  See Lark v. \r\n  Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981) (holding that \r\n  an appellate courtâ€™s review of appeals from the Commission is limited to deciding \r\n  whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or \r\n  is controlled by some error of law);Â  Broughton v.

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Following his arrest for driving under the influence, Timothy \r\n  R. Sponar refused to take a Datamaster test.Â  Pursuant to this refusal, the \r\n  Department of Public Safety (DPS) revoked Sponarâ€™s driverâ€™s license.Â  Sponar \r\n  requested an implied consent hearing, after which a DPS Administrative Hearing \r\n  Officer upheld the suspension.Â  Sponar then appealed this decision to the circuit \r\n  court, which reversed the suspension.Â  DPS now appeals arguing the circuit court \r\n  erred by (1) improperly applying the standard of review to reverse the hearing \r\n  officerâ€™s decision and (2) considering Sponarâ€™s state of mind at the time he \r\n  refused to take the Datamaster test.Â  We reverse and reinstate the suspension.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\nOn August 7, 2000, Officer C. Googe of the Mount Pleasant Police Department \r\n  observed a vehicle traveling at 78 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone \r\n  and initiated a traffic stop.Â  During the stop, Officer Googe noticed the driver, \r\n  Sponar, smelled of alcohol and had glassy, bloodshot eyes and slurred speech.Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the officer asked Sponar to exit the vehicle and complete a number \r\n  of field sobriety tests.Â  As Sponar could not properly perform any of the tests, \r\n  the officer placed him under arrest, advised him of his Miranda [1]  rights, and transported him to the Mount \r\n  Pleasant Police Department where he then turned Sponar over to Officer Whitcomb \r\n  for administration of a Datamaster test. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nUpon arrival at the police station, Officer Googe turned Sponar over to Officer \r\n  Whitcomb so that he could administer the Datamaster test to determine if Sponarâ€™s \r\n  blood alcohol level was within the legal limit.Â  Officer Whitcomb explained \r\n  to Sponar his Miranda rights and then advised him of his implied consent \r\n  rights, reading them verbatim from the advisement form provided by SLED and \r\n  providing him with a copy.Â  \r\nDuring a mandatory twenty-minute waiting period \r\n  prior to administering the test, Sponar initiated conversation with the officer.Â  \r\n  Sponar repeatedly asked whether he should take the test or whether he should \r\n  refuse, and asked the consequences of taking or refusing the test.Â  Officer \r\n  Whitcomb responded it was not his decision to make and that Respondent would \r\n  have to decide on his own.Â  Sponar asked whether he would still go to jail if \r\n  he took the test, and the officer replied that it did not matter if he took \r\n  the test or not, because he would be going to jail either way.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  Respondent refused to take the test.Â  \r\nPursuant to this refusal, Officer Whitcomb completed \r\n  a Notice of Suspension, and Sponarâ€™s driving privileges were suspended.Â  Sponar \r\n  requested an implied consent hearing and appealed the suspension of his driving \r\n  privileges to DPSâ€™s Office of Administrative Hearings.Â  Sponar argued at the \r\n  hearing that Officer Whitcombâ€™s statement â€“ he would go to jail whether he took \r\n  the test or not â€“ had the effect of distorting his implied consent rights.Â  \r\n  He contended, because his implied consent rights were not properly given, the \r\n  suspension should be reversed.Â  On March 12, 2001, the administrative hearing \r\n  officer issued an order sustaining the suspension.Â  She noted the officer had \r\n  read Sponar his rights verbatim, Sponar indicated he understood his rights, \r\n  and it was only after that, while waiting during the observation period, that \r\n  Sponar began questioning the officer about what would happen to him and Officer \r\n  Whitcomb responded he would be taken to jail as part of their procedure whether \r\n  he submitted to the test or not.Â  \r\nRespondent then appealed the hearing officerâ€™s ruling \r\n  to the circuit court, which issued an order reversing the decision of the hearing \r\n  officer.Â  The circuit court judge noted, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(a)(6), \r\n  the court may reverse the decision of the administrative agency â€œif substantial \r\n  rights of the Petitioner have been prejudiced for various reasons, including \r\n  violations of constitutional or statutory provisions, errors of law, or arbitrariness \r\n  or capriciousness.â€ He determined, because Â§ 56-5-2950(b)(1) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code provides in pertinent part that if the alcohol level at the time of testing \r\n  is â€œfive one-hundredths of one percent or less, it is conclusively presumed \r\n  that the person was not under the influence of alcohol,â€ there was no legal \r\n  basis to support the officerâ€™s statement to Sponar that he â€œwas to be jailed \r\n  â€˜by lawâ€™ regardless of his decision to submit to the breath test.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(b)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  He reasoned that if Sponar fell within \r\n  this provision, the officer would have lacked probable cause to detain him for \r\n  driving under the influence.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court judge found the \r\n  officerâ€™s instructions were erroneous and unlawfully suggested Sponarâ€™s decision \r\n  to submit to the breath test â€œwould largely be in vain.â€Â  DPS argues this ruling \r\n  was in error.Â  We agree.\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from administrative agencies are governed by the Administrative \r\nProcedures Act (APA).Â  Byerly Hosp. v. South Carolina State Health &amp; Human \r\nServs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1995).Â  The standard \r\nthe circuit court uses to review such decisions is provided by section 1-23-380(6): \r\n \r\n  The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to \r\n    the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm the \r\n    decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The court \r\n    may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant \r\n    have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions \r\n    or decisions are:\r\n   (a)&nbsp; in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n    (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    (c)&nbsp; made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n    (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e)&nbsp; clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial \r\n    evidence on the whole record; or\r\n    (f)&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion \r\n    or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).Â  In reviewing a final decision \r\n  of an administrative agency, the circuit court essentially sits as an appellate \r\n  court to review alleged errors committed by the agency.Â  Kiawah Resort Assocs. \r\n  v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 505, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995).Â  \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is controlled by an error of law \r\n  or is without evidentiary support.Â  Mictronics v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510, 548 S.E.2d 223, 225 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nDPS argues the circuit court improperly applied the standard of review under \r\n  the APA in reversing the decision of the administrative hearing officer.Â  We \r\n  agree.\r\n\r\n  The license to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state \r\n    is not a property right, but is a mere privilege subject to reasonable regulations \r\n    under the police power in the interest of the public safety and welfare.Â  \r\n    Such privilege is always subject to revocation or suspension for any cause \r\n    relating to public safety.Â  However, the privilege cannot be revoked arbitrarily \r\n    or capriciously.\r\n\r\nSummersell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, \r\n  334 S.C. 357, 366, 513 S.E.2d 619, 624 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted), \r\n  vacated in part on other grounds, 337 S.C. 19, 522 S.E.2d 144 (1999). \r\n  \r\nAt the hearing before the circuit court, Sponarâ€™s \r\n  attorney argued that Sponar was improperly given his implied consent rights \r\n  such that he was coerced into not taking the breath test.Â  He asserted, had \r\n  Sponar taken the test and obtained a reading below .05%, the police would have \r\n  had no basis to continue his incarceration.Â  Thus, he contended, because Sponar \r\n  was told he was going to jail regardless of whether he submitted to the test, \r\n  Sponar was coerced into not taking the test.Â  The attorney for DPS countered \r\n  that Sponar was not coerced in any way.Â  He contended that some officers take \r\n  the position that once an individual is arrested for DUI, that person is already \r\n  under arrest and cannot be â€œun-arrest[ed].â€Â  Thus, this officer merely told \r\n  Sponar the â€œtruthâ€ about the policy they followed.Â  \r\nIn reversing the suspension, the circuit court determined \r\n  there was no legal basis to support the officerâ€™s statement to Sponar that he \r\n  â€œwas to be jailed â€˜by lawâ€™ regardless of his decision to submit to the breath \r\n  test.â€Â  It relied on our Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Town of Mount Pleasant \r\n  v. Shaw, 315 S.C. 111, 432 S.E.2d 450 (1993) in finding the implied consent \r\n  instructions given to Sponar were erroneous.Â  In that case, Shaw was arrested \r\n  and charged with DUI.Â  Prior to administration of a breath test, Shaw was informed \r\n  that if he did not take the test, his privilege to drive in South Carolina would \r\n  be suspended for a ninety-day period.Â  Shaw took the test, registering a .25% \r\n  blood alcohol reading.Â  Shaw appealed his subsequent magistrate court conviction \r\n  and the circuit court reversed holding the implied consent advisory did not \r\n  adequately inform him of his option to refuse the test.Â  The Supreme Court reversed \r\n  the circuit court and reinstated Shawâ€™s conviction.Â  In doing so, the court \r\n  noted a common sense reading of the advisory given to Shaw made clear the consequences \r\n  of both taking the test and refusing to take the test.Â  Id. at 113, 432 \r\n  S.E.2d at 451.Â  The court went on to adopt the following rule:\r\n\r\n  [I]f the arrested person is reasonably informed of his rights, duties \r\n    and obligations under our implied consent law and he is neither tricked \r\n    nor misled into thinking he has no right to refuse the test to determine \r\n    the alcohol content in his blood, urine or breath, the test will generally \r\n    be held admissible.\r\n\r\nId. at 113, 432 S.E.2d at 451 (emphasis in \r\n  original) (citation omitted).\r\nShortly after the Shaw decision, our Supreme Court addressed the sufficiency \r\n  of an implied consent advisory following the suspension of the driverâ€™s license \r\n  of an individual who refused a breathalyzer test after his arrest for DUI.Â  \r\n  In Percy v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 315 S.C. \r\n  383, 434 S.E.2d 264 (1993), Percy, who was licensed to drive in Ohio, was advised \r\n  Ohio authorities would be advised of any South Carolina suspension for refusal \r\n  to submit to a breath test.Â  The arresting officer further advised Percy he \r\n  was unaware of the consequences in Ohio of a refusal to take the test in South \r\n  Carolina.Â  Percy refused the breathalyzer, resulting in a ninety-day suspension \r\n  in South Carolina and a one-year suspension in Ohio.Â  Percy had his South Carolina \r\n  suspension reversed by the circuit court, based on his assertion that the implied \r\n  consent warning was insufficient in that it did not contain information that \r\n  Ohio would honor the South Carolina suspension.Â  Our Supreme Court reversed \r\n  and reinstated Percyâ€™s suspension, stating â€œ[t]he statute requires only that \r\n  an accused be advised that his privilege to drive will be suspended for 90 days \r\n  if he refuses the breathalyzer.â€Â  Id. at 385, 434 S.E.2d at 265.Â  Noting \r\n  the courtâ€™s recent recognition in Shaw that an implied consent advisory \r\n  is sufficient if the defendant is reasonably informed of his rights and is neither \r\n  tricked nor misled into thinking he has no right to refuse the test, the court \r\n  determined it would be unreasonable to require law enforcement to advise out-of-state \r\n  motorists of the consequences that refusal to take the test will have in their \r\n  respective states.Â  Accordingly, the court found Percy was adequately advised \r\n  pursuant to the implied consent statute.Â  Id. at 385, 434 S.E.2d at 265-66. \r\n\r\nWe find the officerâ€™s statement to Sponar that \r\n  he would be going to jail regardless of his decision on whether to submit to \r\n  the breath test did not inadequately advise Sponar pursuant to the implied consent \r\n  statute.Â  First, Â§ 56-5-2950(b)(1) provides that one is conclusively presumed \r\n  to not be under the influence of alcohol if his or her breath test registers \r\n  .05% or lower.Â  Such a result does not rule out the possibility that the individual \r\n  is under the influence of some other intoxicant, or a combination of alcohol \r\n  and another intoxicant.Â  Indeed, an individual may fail field sobriety tests \r\n  and/or exhibit other signs of being under the influence of an intoxicant regardless \r\n  of whether the individual does not have enough alcohol in his or her system \r\n  to register as being under the influence of alcohol.\r\nSecond, the evidence of record shows the officers, \r\n  as a matter of policy, often do not release an individual, regardless of whether \r\n  the breath test results show an individual is conclusively presumed to not be \r\n  under the influence of alcohol.Â  Even if we assumed for the sake of argument \r\n  that it is improper for authorities to continue to detain an individual after \r\n  they have registered below a .05% on a breath test, this is irrelevant to an \r\n  individualâ€™s decision on whether to submit to a breath test. \r\n  [3] Â  Officer Whitcombâ€™s statement to Sponar in this regard was simply a \r\n  truthful explanation of what would happen to him next, and it is irrelevant \r\n  as to whether continued detention in such a situation would be lawful. \r\nFinally, the statements made by Officer Whitcomb \r\n  to SponarÂ  did not â€œtrick or misleadâ€ Sponar into refusing the breath test.Â  \r\n  Such a statement indicated that his decision, either way, would be of no consequence \r\n  to his subsequent immediate incarceration.Â  Officer Whitcomb explicitly indicated \r\n  to Sponar that his decision on whether to take the breath test would have no \r\n  impact on whether he would be jailed.Â  Indeed, the only statement made by the \r\n  officer to Sponar that could reasonably be said to have affected Sponarâ€™s decision \r\n  on whether or not to take the breath test was that his license would be suspended \r\n  for a ninety-day period if he refused the test.Â  The authorities are required \r\n  by law to inform an individual of this consequence before they may administer \r\n  such a test. [4] Â  A common sense \r\n  reading of the advisory given to Sponar made clear the consequences of \r\n  both taking the test and refusing to take the test.Â  He was reasonably informed \r\n  of his rights, duties and obligations, and was not tricked or misled into thinking \r\n  he had no right to refuse the test.Â  Shaw, 315 S.C. at 113, 432 S.E.2d \r\n  at 451.Â  Neither was he tricked or misled into refusing the test.\r\nBecause we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision on \r\n  this ground, DPSâ€™s remaining argument need not be addressed.Â  See Futch \r\n  v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition \r\n  of prior issue is dispositive). \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is reversed and the suspension is \r\n  reinstated. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Miranda \r\n    v.

Gulledge, of Troy, for Appellant.\r\n        C. Rauch Wise, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this domestic relations \r\n  action, we must decide whether the trial court erred in (1) interpreting a foreign \r\n  courtâ€™s award of retirement benefits to include only those benefits accrued \r\n  at the time of the divorce and (2) offsetting the award of retirement benefits \r\n  by the amount of overpaid child support.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nBACKGROUND \r\nDavid Olsen (Husband) and Diane Steffenson (Wife) \r\n  divorced in 1984 in Japan, where Husband was stationed while in the Air Force.Â  \r\n  They divorced under Japanese proceedings of conciliation.Â  The Japanese order \r\n  granted Wife custody of the partiesâ€™ two children and required Husband to pay \r\n  child support of $250 per month for each child, with support for each child \r\n  terminating when that child reached 18.Â  Additionally, the order provided:\r\n\r\n  4.Â  [Husband] shall pay [Wife] the amount equal to 15% of the amount of retirement \r\n    pay, which will be paid to [Husband] at his retirement.\r\n\r\nOther than the allocation of retirement pay, the \r\n  order did not provide for alimony or the distribution of marital property.Â  \r\n  Wifeâ€™s attorney represented to the trial court that the Japanese family court \r\n  does not award alimony, and Wife testified the Japanese family court instructed \r\n  the parties to divide their real and personal property themselves.Â  \r\nPursuant to military regulations, the Japanese court order was transmitted \r\n  to an office that automatically deducted the child support payments from Husbandâ€™s \r\n  pay and forwarded them to Wife. Â The deductions and payments were automatically \r\n  reduced when the oldest child reached 18, but the department failed to discontinue \r\n  deductions or payments when the youngest child reached 18.Â  The $250 monthly \r\n  payments continued for an additional 25 months.Â  As a result, Husband paid $6250 \r\n  in child support after the youngest child reached majority.Â  \r\nHusband retired and began receiving retirement pay in 2000. Â Wife brought \r\n  this action in South Carolina to enforce the Japanese court order after a dispute \r\n  arose regarding payment of retirement benefits.Â  In her complaint, Wife asserted \r\n  the Japanese conciliation procedure requires parties to submit a divorce agreement \r\n  to the court, which the court adopts and gives formal, judicial sanction equivalent \r\n  to a divorce decree.Â  In his responsive pleading, Husband stated he was without \r\n  sufficient information to form a belief regarding the nature of the conciliation \r\n  procedure.Â  \r\nThe court issued an initial order ruling the divorce \r\n  decree was entitled to recognition and enforcement.Â  Neither party appealed \r\n  that order.\r\nAfter a hearing on the merits, the court issued an order acknowledging the \r\n  parties had reached an agreement that formed the Japanese courtâ€™s order, but \r\n  found the terms of the agreement ambiguous.Â  Upon consideration of evidence \r\n  outside the agreement including the testimony of the parties, the court concluded \r\n  the parties agreed Wife would receive only 15 percent of Husbandâ€™s retirement \r\n  pay that â€œaccumulated during the marriage.â€Â  The court further found and concluded \r\n  Husband was entitled to an offset equal to his child support overpayment.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\nI.Â  Retirement Benefits \r\nWife argues the court erred in concluding \r\n  the Japanese divorce decree entitles her to only 15 percent of Husbandâ€™s retirement \r\n  pay that had accrued as of the date of their divorce.Â  We agree.\r\nThe trial court concluded the terms of the partiesâ€™ agreement were â€œnot clear \r\n  or apparent,â€ and thus considered extrinsic evidence in reaching its decision.Â  \r\n  We, however, conclude the provision in question clearly requires Husband to \r\n  pay Wife 15 percent of his entire retirement benefits he receives upon retirement.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œUnambiguous marital agreements will be enforced in accordance with their terms, \r\n  while ambiguous agreements will be examined in the same manner as other agreements \r\n  in order to determine the intention of the parties.â€Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay, \r\n  328 S.C. 329, 337, 491 S.E.2d 583, 587 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Whether an ambiguity \r\n  exists must be determined from the language of the agreement.Â  Id.Â  If \r\n  an agreement is clear and unambiguous, its terms should be applied according \r\n  to their plain and ordinary meaning and consideration of extrinsic evidence \r\n  to alter that meaning is improper.Â  C.A.N.

App. 2003) (â€œThe parol evidence \r\n  rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of agreements or understandings \r\n  contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a written instrument when the \r\n  extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or explain the written \r\n  instrument.â€).Â  \r\n The provision in question clearly requires Husband to pay Wife an amount equal \r\n  to 15 percent of his retirement pay.Â  Had the parties intended to limit the \r\n  award to those benefits accrued during the marriage, they could have so provided, \r\n  and it is not for the trial court or this court to change the terms the parties \r\n  agreed upon.Â  See Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 387, 585 S.E.2d \r\n  501, 503 (2003) (â€œThe judicial function of a court of law is to enforce a contract \r\n  as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of \r\n  judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and unambiguous.â€); \r\n  Charles v. Canal Ins. Co., 238 S.C. 600, 608-09, 121 S.E.2d 200, 205 \r\n  (1961) (holding where a contractâ€™s terms are clear, the courtâ€™s function is \r\n  to enforce the terms and not to substitute its own judgment for that of the \r\n  parties).Â  \r\nHusband agrees the retirement award provision is facially clear but contends \r\n  it contains a latent ambiguity that arose only when his obligation to make payments \r\n  began upon his retirement.Â  Because the document does not define â€œretirement \r\n  payâ€ or â€œamount of retirement pay,â€ Husband claims the ambiguity is whether \r\n  â€œamount of retirementâ€ refers to the retirement he would have been entitled \r\n  to had he retired at the rank he held when the parties divorced or whether it \r\n  was to be based on the rank he achieved by the end of his career.Â  He also argues \r\n  it is not clear whether Wife is entitled to a percentage of the gross pay or \r\n  the net disposable income.Â  Finally, Husband contends allowing Wife to receive \r\n  15 percent of his entire retirement benefits â€œwould give [her] the windfall \r\n  of an additional seventeen years of military service by [Husband].â€Â  \r\nIn essence, Husbandâ€™s argument is not that a latent \r\n  ambiguity is revealed upon application, but rather that he finds a literal application \r\n  of the provisionâ€™s terms unfair.Â  However, the courtâ€™s duty â€œis to enforce the \r\n  contract made by the parties regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, \r\n  or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.â€Â  Jordan v. Sec. \r\n  Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993).Â  Husbandâ€™s argument \r\n  is similar to an argument that the parties have undergone a change of circumstances.Â  \r\n  However, just as a change of circumstances within the partiesâ€™ contemplation \r\n  at the time of the decree does not provide a basis for modifying a support award, \r\n  Husband cannot argue this agreement should be read differently because his retirement \r\n  benefits are more than they would have been had he retired at the rank he held \r\n  when the parties divorced.Â  See Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, \r\n  374, 555 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding change of circumstances within \r\n  the partiesâ€™ contemplation at the time of decree not a ground for altering a \r\n  support award).Â  In fact, the award to Wife of only 15 percent of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement pay suggests the parties did anticipate Husband would advance in \r\n  rank and would be entitled to more retirement pay than that which he had accumulated \r\n  when the parties divorced.Â  See id.Â  (holding a court should apply \r\n  the contemplated change of circumstances rule by not only determining whether \r\n  the parties contemplated the change but whether the decree actually reflects \r\n  the expectation of the future occurrence).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Offset \r\nWife also contends the trial court erred in setting off the amount of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement arrearage by the amount he overpaid in child support.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe evidence at trial demonstrated Husband had no control over the monthly \r\n  withholdings from his military pay.Â  Notwithstanding the automatic nature of \r\n  the monthly deductions from Husbandâ€™s pay, Wife contends she had the right to \r\n  assume the payments were voluntary monthly gifts from her former spouse. Â The \r\n  trial court heard both Husband and Wife on this issue and determined the payments \r\n  were not voluntarily made by Husband and were not intended or received as a \r\n  gift.Â  We perceive no basis for questioning this assessment.Â  Pountain v. \r\n  Pountain, 332 S.C. 130, 135, 503 S.E.2d 757, 759-60 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œBecause \r\n  this court is not afforded the opportunity for direct observation of the witnesses, \r\n  we must accord great deference to the trial courtâ€™s findings where matters of \r\n  credibility are involved.â€).Â  Indeed, considering Husband had no control over \r\n  the payments, the family court acted well within its equitable power in crediting \r\n  those involuntary payments toward the amount of retirement benefits owed Wife.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWife is entitled to an amount equal to 15 percent of Husbandâ€™s entire retirement \r\n  pay to be offset by the amount he overpaid in child support.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3849","title":"Clear Channel Outdoor v.

Myrtle Beach asserts the circuit court improperly characterized \r\n  the Boardâ€™s scope of review and misapplied the cityâ€™s zoning ordinance.Â  We \r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS \r\nOn July 6, 2001, a tornado struck Myrtle Beach, destroying a billboard owned \r\n  and operated by Respondent Clear Channel Outdoor.Â  The tornadoâ€™s winds fractured \r\n  the billboardâ€™s structural support beams in excess of their yield points and \r\n  caused the billboard to fall over and across an adjacent parking lot.Â  For reasons \r\n  of safety, Clear Channel removed the entire sign structure from the site, preserving \r\n  evidence of the damage by photographs.Â  When the City of Myrtle Beach (the â€œCityâ€) \r\n  studied the site to complete a storm damage assessment, the City discovered \r\n  that Clear Channelâ€™s billboard, which was previously thought to be a single \r\n  billboard, had actually been two separate billboards: one supported by 4 I-beams \r\n  and the other supported by 3 I-beams.Â  \r\nAfter an initial inquiry with the Cityâ€™s zoning \r\n  staff regarding replacing the downed billboards with a single pole structure, \r\n  Clear Channelâ€™s real estate manager was advised that a permit to replace the \r\n  signs would not be issued because section 902.9.1 of Myrtle Beachâ€™s zoning ordinance \r\n  prohibited the construction of new billboards within the city.Â  On July 23, \r\n  2001, Clear Channel formally applied for a permit to replace the fallen billboards \r\n  with a new monopole structure.Â  By letter dated July 30, 2001, the Cityâ€™s zoning \r\n  administrator denied the permit on the same grounds that had been previously \r\n  stated.Â  \r\nFollowing the zoning administratorâ€™s decision, \r\n  Clear Channel appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.Â  The Board found that \r\n  Clear Channelâ€™s closely spaced billboards did not conform to the requirement \r\n  in section 902.7.2.c.2 that a distance of 750 feet separate billboards.Â  The \r\n  Board concluded that section 902.8.3.d prohibited the re-establishment of the \r\n  nonconforming billboards because the damage was such that the structural supports \r\n  had fractured or exceeded their yield points. [1] Â  Additionally, the Board concluded that Clear Channel was not \r\n  proposing to restore the billboards, but to construct a completely new one, \r\n  and to issue such a permit would contravene the prohibition of new billboards \r\n  after February 10, 1998 in section 902.9.1 of the ordinance. \r\nOn December 3, 2001, Clear Channel appealed to \r\n  the circuit court, which first upheld the Boardâ€™s decision, but then vacated \r\n  the first order and reversed the Boardâ€™s decision following a motion to reconsider \r\n  filed by Clear Channel.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s second order specifically found: \r\n  1) the order prepared by the City contained incorrect and unintended findings \r\n  and conclusions; 2) the City misconstrued and misapplied its ordinances; and \r\n  3) Clear Channel did not lose its rights based on an act of God.Â  This appeal \r\n  follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nA zoning boardâ€™s findings of fact are final and conclusive on appeal and should \r\n  be treated in the same manner as a finding of fact by a jury and the court may \r\n  not take additional evidence. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2003). Appeal \r\n  to the circuit court is only for a determination of whether the boardâ€™s decision \r\n  is correct as a matter of law.Â  On appeal from the circuit court, the Zoning \r\n  Boardâ€™s decision should not be interfered with unless it is arbitrary or clearly \r\n  erroneous.Â  Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 346 S.C. 401, 406, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2001); Rest. Row Assocs. v. Horry County, 327 \r\n  S.C. 383, 389, 489 S.E.2d 641, 644 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nISSUES \r\n\r\n   \r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in holding that the Board of Zoning \r\n      Appeals was precluded from considering provisions of the sign ordinance \r\n      other than Section 902.9.1 in its deliberations?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in its application of the sign provisions \r\n      of the Myrtle Beach Zoning Ordinance to the facts of this case?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n    &nbsp; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in holding that Clear Channel had \r\n      a vested right to construct a new billboard, despite the level of damage \r\n      that had been sustained by the old billboard?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn reversing the Boardâ€™s decision, the circuit court held â€œ[t]he record showed \r\n  Section 902.9.1 was the sole basis for the Zoning Administratorâ€™s denial of \r\n  the permit, and no other issue was properly before the Board of Zoning Appeals.â€Â  \r\n  Appellant contends this was in error because the Board was not restricted to \r\n  consideration of section 902.9.1 of the zoning ordinance in assessing the denial.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nThe Board of Zoning Appeals exercises substantial power in its review of Zoning \r\n  Administratorsâ€™ decisions.Â  Few restrictions encumber the scope of the Boardâ€™s \r\n  authority:Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]he board of appeals may . . . reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or \r\n    may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that \r\n    end, has all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may \r\n    issue or direct the issuance of a permit.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800 (E) (Supp. 2003). \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nSection 504.1 of Myrtle Beachâ€™s zoning ordinance \r\n  further empowers the Board to â€œmake such order, requirement, decision or determination \r\n  as ought to be made.â€Â  Rather than binding the Board to the conclusion or reasoning \r\n  of the zoning administrator, the forgoing statute and ordinance authorizes the \r\n  Board to review the basis of the zoning administratorâ€™s decision, consider the \r\n  basis of the appeal, and apply the appropriate provisions of the zoning ordinance \r\n  as dictated by the facts before it.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in \r\n  limiting the Zoning Boardâ€™s review to one section of the Cityâ€™s zoning ordinance.\r\nAppellant next contends that the circuit court erred in determining that the \r\n  Board misconstrued provisions of the zoning ordinance.Â  We agree.\r\nCourts are bound to afford substantial deference \r\n  to the decisions of those charged with interpreting and applying local zoning \r\n  ordinances.Â  Purdy v. Moise, 223 S.C. 298, 302, 75 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1953) \r\n  (â€œ[T]his construction of its own ordinance, the enforcement of which it is charged \r\n  with, should be given some consideration and not overruled without cogent reason \r\n  therefore.â€).Â  â€œThe circuit court should not disturb the findings of the board \r\n  unless the board has acted arbitrarily or in an obvious abuse of discretion, \r\n  or unless the board has acted illegally or in excess of its lawfully delegated \r\n  authority.â€Â  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 \r\n  (1987).Â  As a consequence, a court must â€œrefrain from substituting its judgment \r\n  for that of the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with the decision.â€Â  Peterson \r\n  Outdoor Adver. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 327 S.C. 230, 235, 489 S.E.2d 630, \r\n  633 (1997).Â  To this end, a court will uphold the decisions of a reviewing body \r\n  if there is any evidence in the record to support its decision.Â  See \r\n  Historic Charleston Found. v. Krawcheck, 313 S.C. 500, 505-06, 443 S.E.2d \r\n  401, 405 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating an appellate court should not reverse the \r\n  circuit court's affirmance of a Board unless the Boardâ€™s findings of fact have \r\n  no evidentiary support or the Board commits an error of law).Â  \r\nAs with statutes, the lawmakersâ€™ intent embodied \r\n  in an ordinance â€œmust prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language \r\n  used.â€Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 \r\n  S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).Â  We review a zoning ordinance to give \r\n  it a â€œpractical, reasonable and fair interpretation consonant with the purposes, \r\n  design, and policy of the lawmakers.â€Â  Id. at 68, 459 S.E.2d at 843.Â  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the purpose behind the ordinanceâ€™s \r\n  treatment of nonconforming signs was explicitly codified in section 902.8.1 \r\n  as follows: \r\n\r\n  Signs which were in existence prior to August 7, 1979, which do not conform \r\n    to the provisions of this ordinance are declared nonconforming signs.Â  It \r\n    is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination, \r\n    as expeditiously and fairly as possible, of nonconforming signs is as much \r\n    a subject of health, safety and welfare as is the prohibit[i]on of new signs \r\n    that would violate the provisions of the ordinance.\r\n\r\nThus, not only was the ordinance drafted to prevent \r\n  the erection of new nonconforming signs, it also contemplates the elimination \r\n  of then-existing nonconforming signs.Â  In keeping with this intent, the ordinance \r\n  states: â€œ[T]he right to maintain any nonconforming sign shall terminate and \r\n  shall cease to exist whenever the sign is destroyed.â€Â  Because the zoning ordinanceâ€™s \r\n  spacing requirement rendered the billboards â€œnonconformingâ€ and a tornado rendered \r\n  them â€œdestroyed,â€ ample evidence in the record supports the Boardâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that Clear Channel did not have a right to erect a new billboard where the others \r\n  had been.Â  This conclusion is only reinforced by the ordinanceâ€™s prohibition \r\n  on new billboards in section 902.9.1.Â  With the â€œany evidenceâ€ standard satisfied, \r\n  rather than substituting its judgment for that of the Board, the circuit court \r\n  was bound to uphold the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  Krawcheck, 313 S.C. at 505, \r\n  443 S.E.2d at 405.Â  \r\nFinally, Respondent asserts that a use, whether \r\n  conforming or nonconforming, is not lost when the cause of the loss is beyond \r\n  the property ownerâ€™s control. We disagree and find that Respondent did not have \r\n  a vested right to reconstruct a sign.Â  â€œ[T]he intention of all zoning laws, \r\n  as regards a nonconforming use of property, is to restrict and gradually eliminate \r\n  the nonconforming use.â€ Christy v. Harleston, 266 S.C. 439, 443, 223 \r\n  S.E.2d 861, 863 (1976).Â  Legislative bodies of cities and incorporated towns \r\n  may, by ordinance, regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings, \r\n  structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes. Gurganious \r\n  v. City of Beaufort, 317 S.C. 481, 489, 454 S.E.2d 912, 917 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-23-10).Â  \r\nThe Cityâ€™s legislative body enacted section 902.8.3.d \r\n  to eliminate nonconforming signs after the signs were destroyed or damaged to \r\n  the extent of exceeding their yield points.Â  Before any damage occurred, the \r\n  signsâ€™ spacing rendered them nonconforming.Â  There is no question that Clear \r\n  Channelâ€™s signs were damaged beyond their yield points, as is evidenced by the \r\n  need to remove the signsâ€™ debris.Â Â Â  The extent of damage from the tornado created \r\n  a need for new signs.Â  Section 902.9.1 states that no new signs shall be constructed \r\n  at any location within the city. Â â€œWhile a property owner has a constitutionally \r\n  protected right to continue the use following enactment of a zoning ordinance, \r\n  provisions terminating the nonconforming use upon destruction of a specified \r\n  portion of the premises . . . are proper, so long as the maximum amount of destruction \r\n  permitted . . . is reasonable.â€Â  Id. at 490, 454 S.E.2d at 918.Â  We conclude \r\n  that the maximum amount of damage permitted by Myrtle Beachâ€™s zoning ordinance \r\n  prohibiting the re-establishment of damaged or destroyed signs is reasonable. \r\n  Construing Section 902.8.3.d with Section 902.9.1, we find Respondent did not \r\n  have a vested right to re-establish the destroyed billboard.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Myrtle Beachâ€™s Code section 902.8.3.d states, in pertinent part, \r\n    â€œ[t]he right to maintain any nonconforming sign shall terminate and shall \r\n    cease to exist whenever the sign structure is destroyed, or is damaged as \r\n    described in subsection 902.4.6.e . . . .â€Â  Section 902.4.6.e states that \r\n    a sign is damaged when the structural support has failed either by fracture \r\n    or by exceeding its yield point. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Amendments enacted in 2003 changed the designation of this portion \r\n    of the statute from (D) to (E); no substantive changes were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
