Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d\r\n  162, 164&nbsp;(S.C.,1991) (citing Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine\r\n  Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 392 S.E.2d 460 (1990)).  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of\r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Middleborough Horizontal Prop. Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison S.p.A.,\r\n  320 S.C. 470, 479, 465 S.E.2d 765, 771&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (citing Baugus\r\n  v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 401 S.E.2d 169 (1991)). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Choice of Law\r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  argue that South Carolina law, not North Carolina law, should be applied in\r\n  this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œUnder\r\n  traditional South Carolina choice of law principles, the substantive law\r\n  governing a tort action is determined by the lex loci delicti, the law of the\r\n  state in which the injury occurred.â€Â  Boone v. Boone,&nbsp;345 S.C. 8,\r\n  13, 546 S.E.2d 191, 193&nbsp;(2001). Â â€œProcedural matters are to be determined\r\n  in accordance with the law of South Carolina, the lex fori.â€Â  McDaniel v.\r\n  McDaniel, 243 S.C. 286, 289, 133 S.E.2d 809, 811&nbsp;(1963).Â  Lex fori\r\n  refers to the law of the forum.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 921 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Therefore, whether a statute of repose is a substantive or\r\n  procedural matter is the deciding factor in what law applies. \r\nPlaintiffs dispute\r\n  the conclusion that South Carolina law requires the application of North Carolina law in this case by arguing this is a novel issue, alleging that prior\r\n  mention of this issue in South Carolina case law is merely dicta, and directing\r\n  the court to other jurisdictions for guidance.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Langley v.\r\n  Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 402, 438 S.E.2d 242, 242 (1993), the plaintiff sued\r\n  his former doctor for misdiagnosing two removed lesions as benign between 1979\r\n  and 1980.Â  This misdiagnosis was discovered in 1990, when a third lesion was\r\n  removed and diagnosed as malignant.Â  Id.Â  Between 1984 and when the suit\r\n  was brought, the plaintiff lived in Florida.Â  Id.Â  The question then\r\n  became if the plaintiffâ€™s continued absence from South Carolina tolled the six\r\n  year statute of repose on a medical malpractice case.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn determining\r\n  whether the statute of repose was tolled, the South Carolina Supreme Court explored\r\n  whether the statute of repose is substantive or procedural and distinguished\r\n  statute of repose and statutes of limitation.Â  Id. at 403-04, 438 S.E.2d\r\n  at 243.Â  The court stated, â€œ[a] statute of repose\r\n  creates a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability\r\n  after a legislatively-determined period of time.â€Â  Id. at 404, 438 S.E.2d at 243 (emphasis added).Â  The court in Langley additionally declared â€œ[a] statute of repose constitutes a substantive definition of\r\n  rights rather than a procedural limitation provided by a statute of limitation.â€Â  Id.; see also Florence County Sch. Dist. v. Interkal,\r\n  Inc., 348 S.C. 446, 453, 559 S.E.2d 866, 869 (Ct. App. 2002) (the court\r\n  distinguished statute of repose from statutes of limitation, determining that a\r\n  statute of repose involves a substantive right\r\n  while citing Langley).\r\nPlaintiff\r\n  argues the courtsâ€™ treatment of statute of repose in Langley and Interkal was dicta, and therefore, this court should look to other jurisdictions for\r\n  guidance.Â  Judicial dicta is â€œnot essential to the decision.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 465 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Dicta or, as it is also known, dictum\r\n  â€œis a statement on a matter not necessarily involved in the case, and is not\r\n  binding as authority.Â  Dictum is an opinion expressed by a court, but which,\r\n  not being necessarily involved in the case, is not the courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  21\r\n  C.J.S. Courts Â§ 227 (2006).\r\nThe Alabama and   Connecticut case law advanced by Plaintiffs are interesting but do not\r\n  constitute persuasive precedent for this court.Â  In Connecticut, statute of\r\n  repose is not per se substantive or procedural; instead, the court examines the\r\n  nature of the underlying right.Â  Baxter v. Sturm, Ruger and Co., Inc.,\r\n  644 A.2d 1297, 1302 (Conn. 1994).Â  In Alabama, the court examines the out of state\r\n  statute to determine if it affects procedural or substantive rights.Â  Etheredge\r\n  v. Genie Industries, Inc., 632 So.2d 1324, 1326 (Ala. 1994).\r\nThe\r\n  courtsâ€™ holdings in Langley and Interkal depended on determining\r\n  the type of right created by statute of repose and distinguishing statute of\r\n  repose from statutes of limitation.Â  Therefore, the clear guidance provided by\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court and this court was not dicta and negates any\r\n  need to examine other jurisdictionsâ€™ treatment of this issue. Â The precedent\r\n  created in Langley and acknowledged in Interkal illustrates that\r\n  whether statute of repose is a substantive right is not a novel question.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Policy\r\nPlaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in not applying the\r\n  public policy exception to lex loci deliciti.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[U]nder\r\n  the â€˜public policy exception,â€™ the Court will not apply foreign law if it\r\n  violates the public policy of South Carolina.â€Â  Boone v. Boone, 345 S.C.\r\n  8, 14, 546 S.E.2d 191, 193 (2001).Â  â€œ[F]oreign law may not be given effect in\r\n  this State if â€˜it is against good\r\n  morals or natural justice.â€™â€Â  Id. at 13, 546 S.E.2d at 193.Â  Examples of\r\n  cases against good morals and natural justice are â€œprohibited marriages,\r\n  wagers, lotteries, racing, contracts for gaming or the sale of liquors, and\r\n  others.â€Â  Dawkins, 306 S.C. at 393, 412 S.E.2d at 408.Â  â€œ[T]he fact that the law of two states may differ does not\r\n  necessarily imply that the law of one state violates the public policy of the\r\n  other.â€Â  Boone, 345 S.C. 13-14, 546 S.E.2d at 408. \r\nIn Langley, the court discussed the purpose of statute of\r\n  repose.Â  â€œStatutes\r\n  of repose are based upon considerations of the economic best interests of the\r\n  public as a whole and are substantive grants of immunity based upon a\r\n  legislative balance of the respective rights of potential plaintiffs and\r\n  defendants struck by determining a time limit beyond which liability no longer\r\n  exists.â€Â  313 S.C. at 404, 438 S.E.2d at 244.Â  The court in Langley further explained: \r\n\r\n  Society\r\n    benefits when claims and causes are laid to rest after having been viable for\r\n    [a] reasonable time. When causes of action are extinguished after such time,\r\n    society generally may continue its business and personal relationships in\r\n    peace, without worry that some cause of action may arise to haunt it because of\r\n    some long-forgotten act or omission. This is not only for the convenience of\r\n    society but also due to necessity. At that point, society is secure and stable.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\n\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s statute of repose for\r\n  actions alleging defective or unsafe conditions of an improvement to real property bars actions brought more than eight\r\n  years after substantial completion of the improvement.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-640\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  Conversely, North Carolinaâ€™s equivalent statute of repose bars\r\n  claims brought more than six years after substantial completion of the\r\n  improvement.Â  N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 1-50(a)(5) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\nPublic policy is not violated by the two year difference in South Carolina and North Carolinaâ€™s statutes of repose.Â  Notably, Plaintiffsâ€™ attempt to\r\n  bring this case in South Carolina constitutes forum shopping, an act which\r\n  violates public policy.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court properly applied North Carolina law\r\n  and dismissed the case under summary judgment after finding the claims were\r\n  time barred by the North Carolina statute of repose.Â  Based on this conclusion,\r\n  we need not address any remaining\r\n  issues.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCRCP; Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n  Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n  (1999) (stating that if an appellate court's ruling on a particular issue is\r\n  dispositive of an appeal, rulings on remaining issues are unnecessary).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did\r\n  not err in applying North Carolinaâ€™s statute of repose, and thereby, granting\r\n  summary judgment to Tindall.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Plaintiffs allege the double tees were manufactured\r\n  in South Carolina. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4285","title":"State v.

Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  The question raised by appellant Danny Whitten is whether the trial court erred in refusing to charge assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) as a lesser-included offense of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct (ACSC) in the third degree.[1]Â  A jury found Whitten guilty of the latter offense and the trial judge sentenced him to a ten-year sentence of imprisonment.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe victim, a woman seventy-six-years-old at the time of trial, allowed Whitten, her thirty-year-old nephew, to live with her in her trailer home.Â  The victim testified that on November 25, 2004, while she was watching television late that night, Whitten came home drunk and dragged or carried her into his bedroom.Â  Whitten allegedly placed her on his bed, pulled off her blue jeans, removed all of his clothes but his shirt, crawled on top of the victim, and attempted to penetrate the victim as she crossed her legs and held them tight.Â  The victim continued to resist and told Whitten repeatedly, â€œlet me go.â€Â  The victimâ€™s grandnephew, who had arrived at the trailer to watch television with Whitten, overheard the remark when he came to Whittenâ€™s bedroom window after receiving no response when he knocked on the front door of the trailer.Â  Whitten did not release the victim until her grandnephew walked into the home.Â  When he entered the trailer, the grandnephew saw the victim in â€œthe hallway with no pants onâ€ and Whitten behind her â€œtrying to put his on.â€Â  Whitten denied anything â€œwas going onâ€; however, his aunt, â€œkept saying,â€ while crying, that Whitten had tried to rape her.\r\nFor his part, Whitten testified he bought five cans of malt liquor on his way home from work but, before going home, joined a friend to â€œdrink some Bud Lights . . . for a whileâ€; Whittenâ€™s aunt joined him in drinking that evening upon his return home; Whitten and his aunt had had sex on two prior occasions; and she was willing to have sex again with him that night; Whitten and his aunt were about to have sex when they were surprised by her grandnephewâ€™s knock on the door; Whitten became scared at the thought of others finding out about his sexual relationship with his aunt and briefly held her down; he â€œlet go ofâ€ his aunt when â€œshe started holleringâ€; and he denied to the police the accusation that he had raped his aunt.\r\nWhitten asked for an instruction on ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of ACSC.Â  Whittenâ€™s counsel explained her request this way: â€œI think if the jury . . . believe[s] that Mr. Whitten did not assault [his aunt] with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct . . . that it would be appropriate for a lesser-included charge of a high and aggravated nature.â€Â  The trial judge denied the request, noting the evidence only supported a verdict of â€œguiltyâ€ or â€œnot guilty.â€ Â On appeal, Whitten argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge ABHAN.\r\nâ€œABHAN is a lesser[-]included offense of ACSC.â€[2]Â  â€œABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.â€[3]Â  â€œCircumstances of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful authority.â€[4]Â  â€œA trial judge must charge the jury on a lesser-included offense if there is any evidence from which it could be inferred that the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.â€[5]\r\nOur review of the record does not reveal any evidence that would support a conviction for the lesser offense of ABHAN, at least during the time relevant to the allegations contained in the indictment.Â  The only evidence that could possibly support an ABHAN instruction allegedly occurred after the sexual assault took place, that is, when Whitten heard the grandnephew come into the mobile home and Whitten held the victim to the bed.\r\nThe charge of third degree ACSC relates only to those acts committed by Whitten that preceded the grandnephewâ€™s coming into the mobile home, acts that Whitten claims were consensual in nature and the aunt claims were not.Â  Significantly, the State did not charge Whitten with having committed ABHAN against his aunt after sexually assaulting her.Â  Rather, the State focused entirely on the sexual assault that occurred before the other alleged assault took place.Â  As such, the two events had no bearing upon one another and would thereby not entitle Whitten to an instruction on ABHAN as a lesser-included offense.\r\nWe do not overlook State v. White,[6] a case that neither the appellant nor the State cited in their respective briefs and a case this court later asked the parties to address.Â  While the cases, admittedly, contain similar fact patterns, we are limited in this instance by appellate rules that allow us to consider only the precise question that was before the trial judge and that was ruled on by him or her.Â  Here, Whittenâ€™s counsel never gave as a reason for the requested charge that Whittenâ€™s action in restraining his aunt after her grandnephew came upon the scene could serve as the basis for the requested charge.[7]\r\nWe therefore hold Whittenâ€™s claim that the victim consented to his attempt to have sexual relations with her did not reduce the offense to a lesser charge because, if the jury had found the victim consented, then in that event Whitten would have been entitled to an acquittal rather than to a conviction of another but lesser crime.Â  To have allowed the jury, under the facts of this case, to consider the offense of ABHAN would have permitted the jury to have convicted him of an offense for which he had not been indicted.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J. concur.Â Â    \r\n\r\n[1] Â A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, South Carolina Code Annotated section 16-3-654(1)(a) (2003) provides, â€œif the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim and if . . .

Brown (Husband) alleges\r\n  the family court erred in finding that unallocated support payments were\r\n  non-deductible to him and non-taxable to Rita R. Brown (Wife), and in ordering\r\n  Husband to amend his tax returns, file a joint return with Wife, or compensate\r\n  Wife for the tax consequences she suffered.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  parties were married in May 1987.Â  Wife instituted this action on November 13,\r\n  2003, seeking, inter alia, an award of temporary separate maintenance and\r\n  support.Â  In March, the family court entered a pendente lite order\r\n  (the first order), which provided that â€œ[t]his court will award unallocated\r\n  family support to [Wife] . . . . [Husband] shall pay as unallocated family\r\n  support the amount of $8,500.00 per month.â€Â  \r\nApproximately one year later, Wife filed a motion for additional temporary\r\n  relief, requesting that the family court declare the unallocated support award\r\n  non-taxable to Wife and non-deductible to Husband.Â  Husband argued that\r\n  according to the Internal Revenue Service, he was permitted to deduct the unallocated\r\n  support payment, and he had done so in his tax return.Â  After a hearing, the\r\n  family court issued an order (second order) granting Wifeâ€™s motion.Â  The order\r\n  provided:\r\n\r\n  I know what I intended.Â  It was and still is my intention that all pendente lite unallocated support that [Husband] was ordered to\r\n    pay . . . is and shall be non-taxable to [Wife] and non-deductible to\r\n    [Husband].Â  I have traditionally issued orders for unallocated support and when\r\n    I do so, it is my intention that the unallocated support for the partiesâ€™\r\n    family to be paid by [Husband] and non-taxable to [Wife] for state and federal\r\n    income tax purposes.Â  If it was to be taxable, I would have said it.\r\n\r\nThe family court\r\n  also ordered Husband to either amend\r\n  his tax returns to eliminate the 2004 deduction he claimed, to file a joint\r\n  return with Wife, or to compensate Wife for the tax consequences of the\r\n  unallocated support award.Â  The family court denied Husbandâ€™s subsequent Rule\r\n  59(e) motion.Â  This appeal followed.[1]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the\r\n  authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102\r\n  (2005).Â  In spite of this broad scope of review, we remain mindful that the\r\n  family court judge saw and heard the witnesses and generally is in a better\r\n  position to determine credibility.Â  Id.Â  The appellate court can,\r\n  however, correct errors of law.Â  E.D.M.\r\n    v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court erred in holding the unallocated support\r\n  payments were non-deductible to him and non-taxable to Wife.Â \r\n  Specifically, Husband argues two errors by the family court.Â  First, Husband\r\n  alleges that the family courtâ€™s first order awarding unallocated support\r\n  allowed the amount to be deducted on his income tax returns.Â  Second, he argues\r\n  that the family court erred as a matter of law in holding that the unallocated support payments were non-deductible to him\r\n  and non-taxable to Wife.Â  We agree in part, disagree in part, and affirm\r\n  as modified.\r\nI.\r\nHusband argues that an award of unallocated support is\r\n  traditionally deductible by him as the supporting spouse and taxable to Wife as\r\n  the supported spouse. Â Particularly, Husband contends that the family courtâ€™s\r\n  first order awarding unallocated support to Wife was unambiguous, and\r\n  therefore, allowed the amount to be deducted on his income tax returns. Â We\r\n  agree.\r\nThe issue of the\r\n  tax implications of an unallocated support award has been addressed in South\r\n  Carolina in Delaney v. Delaney, 278 S.C. 55, 293 S.E.2d 304 (1982) and Beinor v. Beinor, 282 S.C. 181, 318 S.E.2d 269 (1984).Â \r\n  In both cases, the supreme court cited approvingly the notion that by making the award unallocated, the amount is taxable to\r\n  the supported spouse and non-taxable to the supporting spouse.Â  The Delaney court, in\r\n  reviewing an unallocated support award, noted:\r\n\r\n  [The supporting spouse] has substantial income, [the\r\n    supported spouse] has little or no income. Â Under these circumstances we\r\n    believe shifting tax liability from the supporting spouse to the supported\r\n    spouse which permits the supported spouse to net tangibly more child support\r\n    and alimony because of the decrease in the supporting spouseâ€™s tax burden is\r\n    good cause for non-allocation of child support\r\n    and alimony.\r\n\r\nDelaney, 278 S.C. at 56-57, 293\r\n  S.E.2d at 304-05.Â  The Beinor court also cited this rationale, stating: â€œThe\r\n  trial judge awarded . . .Â  unallocated support for the [supported spouse] and\r\n  children.Â  By making the award â€˜unallocated,â€™ the amount is taxable to the\r\n  [supported spouse] and non-taxable to the [supporting spouse].â€Â  Beinor,\r\n  282 S.C. at 183, 318 S.E.2d at 269-70.Â  Accordingly, in South Carolina an\r\n  unallocated award of support is traditionally taxable to the supported spouse\r\n  and deductible to the supporting spouse.[2]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family courtâ€™s first order provided\r\n  that â€œ[t]his court will award unallocated family support to [Wife] . . . . Â [Husband]\r\n  shall pay as unallocated family support the amount of $8,500.00 per month.â€Â  This\r\n  order made no reference whatsoever to the tax burdens of either Husband or Wife\r\n  nor did it allocate the tax burdens in a manner different from the traditional\r\n  rule found in Delaney and Beinor.Â  Therefore, given the traditional treatment of the tax implications of\r\n  an award of unallocated support, as well as the unambiguous language of the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order, Husband was justified in deducting the $8,500 in\r\n  unallocated support from his 2004 individual tax return.Â  Because we agree with\r\n  Husband that the initial order was not ambiguous, it was error for the trial\r\n  judge to make the second order retroactive.[3] \r\nII.\r\nThe above\r\n  holding, however, does not fully resolve this matter because the family court\r\n  issued a second order addressing the respective tax burdens of each party.[4]Â \r\n  Husband argues that the family court erred in holding the\r\n  unallocated support payments were non-deductible to him and non-taxable to Wife\r\n  in the second order.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Code specifically allows a family court judge to allocate the\r\n  intended tax consequences for support payments.Â  It provides:\r\n\r\n  The court may elect and determine the intended tax\r\n    effect of the alimony and separate maintenance and support as provided by the\r\n    Internal Revenue Code and any corresponding state tax provisions. The Family\r\n    Court may allocate the right to claim dependency exemptions\r\n    pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and under corresponding state tax\r\n    provisions and to require the execution and delivery of all necessary documents\r\n    and tax filings in connection with the exemption.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (F) (Supp. 2006).Â  Additionally, the Internal Revenue Code\r\n  includes in the definition of gross income an alimony or support payment only when\r\n  the â€œthe divorce or separation instrument does not designate such payment as a\r\n  payment which is not includible in gross income under this section and not\r\n  allowable as a deduction . . . .â€Â  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 71(b)(1)(B).[5]\r\nBoth\r\n  South Carolina law and the Internal Revenue Code provide the family court\r\n  authority to allocate the intended tax consequences of the award of support for\r\n  both Husband and Wife.Â  Therefore, the family court has the authority to\r\n  allocate the tax consequences, and we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision in the\r\n  second order to make the award of support non-deductible to Husband and non-taxable to Wife.[6]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is hereby.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Husband initially appealed from the denial\r\n  of his post trial motion, this Court held the appeal in abeyance pursuant to Neville\r\n    v. Neville, 278 S.C. 411, 297 S.E.2d 423 (1982), pending the issuance of\r\n  the final order.\r\n[2] Â Support for this South Carolina rule can also be\r\n  found in Kean v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 407 F.3D 186 (3rd Cir. 2005), a case cited to this court by both Husband and Wife.Â  In Kean,\r\n  the third circuit, in addressing the tax consequences of an award of\r\n  unallocated support, stated:\r\n\r\n  Where support payments are unallocated, as in this\r\n    case, the entire amount is attributable to the [supported] spouseâ€™s income.Â \r\n    Otherwise, we would be left with a situation in which the portion of the\r\n    unallocated payment intended for the support of the [supported] spouse would be\r\n    taxable to the [supporting] spouse.Â  This treatment of support payments is not\r\n    accidental, and can benefit families going through a divorce. . . .Â  By\r\n    ordering the payor spouse to make an unallocated support payment taxable in\r\n    full to the payee spouse, the couple may be able to shift a greater portion of\r\n    their collective income into a lower tax bracket.Â  Consequently, an unallocated\r\n    payment order not only frees the parents from restrictive court instructions\r\n    that dictate who pays for what, but may allow the parties to enjoy a tax\r\n    benefit at a time when they face increased expenses as they establish\r\n    independent homes.Â  This advantage would be lost by taxing all unallocated\r\n    payments to the payor spouse.\r\n\r\nKean, 407 F.3d at 192-93.\r\n[3]Â  As a result of our holding, Husband does not need to amend his tax returns to eliminate the 2004 deduction\r\n  he claimed on his individual tax return, file a joint return with Wife for that\r\n  year, or to compensate Wife for the tax consequences of the unallocated support\r\n  award.Â  Husband must only take the steps necessary to comply with the family\r\n  courtâ€™s second order that rendered the unallocated support payments taxable to\r\n  him and non-taxable to Wife for the period from the issuance of the second\r\n  order to the final decree of divorce that allocated the support in this matter. \r\n[4]Â  This second order resulted from Wifeâ€™s motion for additional temporary\r\n  relief that requested the family court declare the unallocated support award\r\n  non-taxable to her and non-deductible to Husband.\r\n[5] Â The Internal Revenue Service has interpreted this\r\n  section to allow courts to allocate the tax burden of an award of unallocated\r\n  support.Â  In answering how parties may alter the tax consequences of support\r\n  payments to allow such payments to be excludible from the gross income of the\r\n  supporting spouse and excludible in the income of the supported spouse, the IRS\r\n  stated, â€œIf the spouses are subject to temporary orders the designation of\r\n  otherwise qualifying [support payments] as nondeductible [by the supporting\r\n  spouse] and excludible [from the income of the supported spouse] must be made\r\n  in the original or a subsequent temporary support order.â€Â  26 C.F.R. Â§ 1.71-1T\r\n  (2007).\r\n[6] Â We find it necessary to provide clarification to the\r\n  family court on this issue of unallocated support and the potential tax\r\n  implications of such an award.Â  The family court judge stated she traditionally\r\n  issues orders for unallocated support, and it is always her intent that an\r\n  award of unallocated support be non-deductible to the supporting spouse and\r\n  non-taxable to the supported spouse.Â  An award of unallocated support does not\r\n  accomplish this tax consequence alone.Â  See Delaney v. Delaney,\r\n  278 S.C. 55, 293 S.E.2d 304 (1982); Beinor v.\r\n    Beinor, 282 S.C. 181, 318 S.E.2d 269 (1984).Â  As we have already noted, an unallocated award of support\r\n  is traditionally taxable to the supported spouse and deductible to the\r\n  supporting spouse.Â  Therefore, absent the family court specifically\r\n  allocating the tax implications among the parties, as allowed under section\r\n  20-3-130(F) of the South Carolina Code and 26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 71, an unallocated award of support is deductible to the\r\n  supporting spouse and taxable to the supported spouse. Â Absent such a\r\n  finding, unallocated support would be deductible to the supporting spouse and\r\n  taxable to the supported spouse.Â  Here, the family court judge made a specific\r\n  finding that this award was to be non-deductible to the Husband and non-taxable\r\n  to the Wife; however, had the court not made that specific allocation, the\r\n  unallocated award of support would have been deductible by Husband and taxable\r\n  to Wife. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4287","title":"State v.

Bennett appeals his Community\r\n  Supervision Program (CSP) revocation on the grounds: (1) he was charged,\r\n  convicted, and sentenced as a first offender and thereby not required to\r\n  participate in CSP; and (2) the trial court erred in holding he was required to\r\n  challenge his sentence through a timely post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  application. Â We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBennett\r\n  was indicted for distribution of crack cocaine on April 12, 1999, and pled\r\n  guilty, pro se, to the charge on July 14, 1999. Â He was sentenced\r\n  to four years imprisonment and given credit for roughly six months served. Â Bennett\r\n  did not appeal his conviction or sentence.Â  On June 14, 2002, after serving\r\n  eighty-five percent of his term, approximately three years, four months and\r\n  twenty-three days, Bennett was released and entered South Carolina Department\r\n  of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services' (DPPP) CSP.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 27, 2003, Bennett was charged with violating the conditions of his CSP. Â At\r\n  a CSP revocation hearing the court found Bennett violated his CSP, revoked it,\r\n  and imposed a sentence of eleven months and ten days. Â Bennett did not appeal\r\n  his revocation.Â  On February 24, 2004, after satisfying his first CSP\r\n  revocation, Bennett was released and entered CSP. Â On April 4, 2005, Bennett\r\n  was again charged with violating conditions of his CSP.Â  At the CSP violation\r\n  hearing, Bennett did not contest the alleged violations of his CSP, but rather challenged\r\n  the classification of his original sentence and placement in CSP.Â  \r\nBennett's arrest warrant and indictment specify that\r\n  he was charged with \"Distribution of Crack Cocaine\" in violation of S.C. Code Â§\r\n  44-53-375(B)(1). Â At the time of Bennett's indictment Â§ 44-53-375(B)(1) (Supp.\r\n  1998)[1] read, in part: \r\n\r\n  (B) A\r\n    person who manufactures, distributes, dispenses . . . ice, crank or crack\r\n    cocaine, in violation of Section 44-53-370, is guilty of a felony and, upon\r\n    conviction:\r\n  (1) for\r\n    a first offense, must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more\r\n    than fifteen years . . .\r\n\r\nId.

Â In addition, the\r\n  arrest warrant lists the Criminal Docket Report (CDR) Code, or Offense Code,\r\n  #0112.Â  CDR Code #0112 indicates a first offense, \"Drugs/ Manufacture,\r\n  distribution, etc., ice, crank, crack cocaine - 1st offense.\"Â  The indictment cover\r\n  lists a different CDR Code, #0107, indicating a Class E felony,[2] \"Drugs / Distribute, sell, purchase,\r\n  manuf. drug other than crack cocaine, or pwid, near school.\" \r\nBennett's sentencing sheet indicates that he pled to and was\r\n  convicted of \"Distribution of Crack Cocaine in violation of Â§ 44-53-375(B)(1)\r\n  of the S.C. Code of Laws, bearing CDR Code #0113.\"Â  While Section\r\n  44-53-375(B)(1) indicates a first offense, CDR Code #0113 indicates a second\r\n  offense, \"Drugs / Manufacture, distribution, etc., ice, crank, crack cocaine -\r\n  2nd offense.\" Â There is no record of the original sentencing hearing. \r\nAt his second CSP revocation hearing, Bennett argued that he was\r\n  originally sentenced as a first offender and thereby not required to\r\n  participate in CSP.Â  He averred that the ambiguity between the statute and CDR\r\n  code appearing on his sentencing sheet should be construed as a scrivener's error\r\n  to be resolved in his favor.Â  The State asserted Bennett was a second offender\r\n  and that if Bennett believed he had received \"a wrong sentence or wrong time\"\r\n  he should have challenged his sentence in a timely PCR application.Â  Thus, the State argued because Bennett did not raise\r\n  his claim within a year of his sentence he was beyond the statutory period\r\n  wherein he could have filed such claim.Â  Additionally, the State contended that Bennett's failure\r\n  to raise this argument in his first CSP violation hearing was a waiver of his\r\n  right to raise the claim in the current CSP violation hearing. Â \r\nUltimately, the court agreed with the State finding Bennett should\r\n  have filed a PCR application and was thereby \"well beyond the statutory period\r\n  wherein he could file [his claim].\" Â The court then adopted the State's\r\n  recommendation to find Bennett in violation of his CSP,[3] revoked it and sentenced him to one\r\n  year imprisonment.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. \r\nRather than determine whether Bennett was sentenced as a first\r\n  offender or second offender, the CSP\r\n  revocation judge held Bennett was required to challenge his sentence through a\r\n  timely PCR application.Â  The judge found, \"that now is not the time or the\r\n  place to bring up these arguments that should have been made, at a substantial\r\n  period of time prior to now, in a PCR application.\"Â  On appeal, Bennett argues\r\n  \"the lower court committed an error of law by ruling that appellant should have\r\n  challenged his sentence through a timely application for post-conviction relief\r\n  (PCR),\" citing Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742\r\n  (2000).Â  We agree.\r\nIn Al-Shabbaz\r\n  v. State the supreme court explained, in depth, the process by which PCR\r\n  applicants and inmates raise certain types of claims.Â  338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d\r\n  742 (2000).Â  The court made a distinction between the process for claims\r\n  attacking the validity of a conviction or sentence and claims seeking review of\r\n  non-collateral or administrative matters.Â  The court elucidated: \r\n\r\n  PCR is\r\n    a proper avenue of relief only when the applicant mounts a collateral attack\r\n      challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence as authorized by\r\n    Section 17-27-20(a).[4] . . . \r\n  The\r\n    only exceptions to our holding are two non-collateral matters specifically\r\n    listed in Section 17-27-20(a)(5): the claim that an applicant's sentence has\r\n    expired and the claim that an applicant's probation, parole, or conditional\r\n    release has been unlawfully revoked.Â  Under the approach we outline today,\r\n    these claims are non-collateral matters because neither constitutes a challenge\r\n    to the validity of the underlying conviction or sentence. . .\r\n  We\r\n    hold that these two claims, because they are specifically listed in the PCR\r\n    Act, may be raised in PCR or as a non-collateral matter in the manner\r\n    outlined below. . .\r\n\r\nId. at 367-368, 527 S.E.2d at 749 (emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  The supreme court continued, explaining the process to be used when\r\n  an inmate seeks review of a South Carolina Department of Correction's (SCDOC) final\r\n  decision in a non-collateral or administrative matter.[5]Â  Id. at 368-383, 527 S.E.2d at 749-757.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Bennett is not making a collateral attack challenging the\r\n  validity of his conviction or sentence that would force him to bring his claim\r\n  under the PCR Act.Â  To the contrary, Bennett is trying to enforce his\r\n  sentence.Â  Bennett avers he was appropriately sentenced under Â§ 44-53-375(B)(1),\r\n  as a first offender and now is wrongly being classified and treated as a second\r\n  offender.Â  Because Bennett raises a non-collateral matter, whether it falls\r\n  within the ambit of Â§17-27-20(a)(5) or is another form of non-collateral\r\n  relief, Al-Shabbaz clearly allows for the matter to be raised in either\r\n  a PCR and/or as a non-collateral matter in the manner outlined in Al-Shabbaz.Â \r\n  Thus, Al-Shabbaz provides an avenue of relief for Bennett to challenge\r\n  the classification of his original sentence other than through PCR.Â  Although\r\n  we believe Bennett is entitled to a review of his claim pursuant to Al-Shabazz,\r\n  we address it now because we find Bennett was sentenced as a first offender and\r\n  has exceeded his original sentence, as further discussed, and thus he should\r\n  not be forced to pursue and await the outcome of such a claim.Â  See State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 463-64, 510 S.E.2d 423, 425-27 (1999)\r\n  (addressing defendant's claim rather than requiring her to pursue a remedy\r\n  through PCR finding she already served the duration of her sentence and faced\r\n  the threat of continued incarceration beyond the legal sentence due to the\r\n  additional time it would take to pursue such a remedy).\r\nII.\r\nBennett\r\n  contends he was sentenced as a first offender and should not be subject to\r\n  CSP.Â  His sentencing sheet lists a statute indicating he was sentenced as a\r\n  first offender and a CDR code indicating he was sentenced as a second offender.Â \r\n  As a first offender Bennett would have been eligible for parole. Â As a second\r\n  offender Bennett was not eligible for parole but after serving 85 percent of\r\n  his sentence was required to participate in CSP.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A), participation in CSP is a mandatory condition of\r\n  release for most no-parole offenses.Â  DPPP sets the initial length of CSP, not\r\n  to exceed two continuous years, as well as the terms and conditions of CSP, and\r\n  determines whether violations have occurred.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(B)\r\n  (2002); see also State v. Mills, 360 S.C. 621, 625, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  750, 752 (2004) (Pleicones, J., dissenting opinion) (discussing CSP).Â  If DPPP\r\n  determines a CSP violation has occurred, it must initiate a revocation\r\n  proceeding during which a circuit court judge determines whether a prisoner has\r\n  willfully violated the terms of his CSP.Â  The judge may impose other terms or\r\n  conditions and continue CSP or revoke CSP and impose a sentence up to one\r\n  year.Â  If a prisoner's CSP is revoked and the court imposes a sentence, the\r\n  prisoner must also complete a CSP of up to two years when he is released.Â  For\r\n  a successive revocation, the prisoner may be sentenced for up to one year for\r\n  the violation, with the limitation that the total time imposed for successive\r\n  revocations cannot exceed the length of time of the prisoner's original\r\n  sentence.Â  \r\nThe supreme court addressed this statute in State v. Mills,\r\n  reinforcing that a prisoner may serve an amount equal to the original sentence\r\n  for CSP violations.Â  In Mills, Appellant was originally sentenced to six\r\n  months.Â  He served five months and two days of the original sentence and was released\r\n  into CSP which was to continue for two years.Â  Appellant's CSP was revoked and\r\n  he served three weeks in prison for the CSP violations.Â  Appellant's CSP was\r\n  revoked for a second time and he was sentenced to five months and seven days.Â  Appellant\r\n  appealed this second revocation, claiming that the length of imprisonment for\r\n  CSP violations could not exceed the remaining length of time left on his\r\n  original sentence of six months.Â  Since Appellant served five months and two\r\n  days of his original sentence in addition to three weeks from his first CSP\r\n  revocation, he argued his second revocation could not exceed five days.Â  The\r\n  supreme court disagreed and upheld the second CSP revocation sentence,\r\n  explaining that the statute provides that sentences for successive CSP\r\n  revocations may total the time of the original sentence. \r\nIn this\r\n  case, Bennett was originally sentenced to four years and after serving\r\n  approximately three years, four months and twenty three days, he was released\r\n  into CSP.Â  Bennett was to serve two years on CSP, but after eleven months and\r\n  two days his CSP was revoked and he was sentenced to eleven months and ten days\r\n  imprisonment for the CSP violation.Â  After serving his first CSP revocation he\r\n  was again released into CSP.Â  After roughly one year and five months Bennett's\r\n  CSP was revoked for a second time and he was sentenced to one year imprisonment\r\n  for his CSP violations.Â  After serving one year on his second CSP revocation, Bennett\r\n  was again released into CSP.[6]Â \r\n  According to the statute and Mills, Bennett still has roughly two years\r\n  and twenty days which he can serve for CSP violations. Â Therefore, if Bennett\r\n  were to violate the terms of his CSP for a third time he would again be subject\r\n  to imprisonment for up to one year.Â  Once released into CSP for a fourth time,\r\n  Bennett could serve up to one additional year if he were to violate his CSP and\r\n  have it revoked.Â  And still, once release into CSP for a fifth time, if he were\r\n  to violate the terms of his CSP, he would be subject to twenty more days in\r\n  prison.Â  \r\nBennett's placement and participation in CSP is a result of being\r\n  treated as a second offender, as indicated by the CDR code on his sentencing\r\n  sheet.Â  Bennett's argument that he was a first offender rests in that the\r\n  statute on the sentencing sheet indicates he is a first offender and that the\r\n  statute should control, not the CDR code.Â  \r\nEssential to a determination on Bennett's claim is an\r\n  understanding of CDR codes and how they are utilized in the overall judicial\r\n  process.Â  CDR codes are four digit numerical codes which represent the criminal\r\n  offenses created by the South Carolina General Assembly and common law.Â  See South Carolina Judicial Department, CDR Codes Frequently Asked Questions,\r\n  http://www.sccourts.org/cdr/userInstructions.htm.Â  The codes were developed in\r\n  the late 1970's in a collaborative effort between the South Carolina Justice\r\n  Department (SCJD), DPPP, and SCDOC.Â  They were created at a time when computer\r\n  systems had limited memory and did not have the capacity to maintain references\r\n  to specific statutes which could contain many digits.[7]Â  Id. Â The shorter CDR codes\r\n  saved computer space and provided a consistent administrative shortcut to be\r\n  used by all three departments.Â  Id.Â  The code developers started with a\r\n  list of statutory criminal offenses and assigned each a number.Â  As laws change\r\n  and new offenses are created, the codes are updated. Â The master list of CDR\r\n  codes is now maintained by the SCJD which monitors the legislative process to\r\n  determine required changes and corrects errors in the codes.Â  \r\nWhile the codes were developed and are used to provide an\r\n  administrative shortcut, they were never intended to replace statutory law.Â  Id.Â  The codes are normally listed after the statute on all warrants, indictments,\r\n  and sentencing sheets.Â  As the SCJD's website explains, the elements of a\r\n  crime, its penalties and other related matters are governed by the Code of Laws\r\n  and the common law alone.Â  Id.Â  Any errors in a CDR code do not affect\r\n  the crime, its characterization as violent or non-violent, for example, or even\r\n  if someone can be prosecuted for a crime.Â  Id.Â  The website further\r\n  states in a disclaimer, \"[t]he South Carolina Code of Laws is the controlling\r\n  authority for classifications, definitions and penalties for criminal offenses,\r\n  and the statute itself should always be consulted.\"Â  Id. (emphasis added); see also South Carolina Judicial Department,\r\n  CDR Codes, http://www.sccourts.org/cdr/index.cfm.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, at oral argument, the State agreed that Bennett's sentencing sheet was\r\n  filled out incorrectly and that either the CDR code or the statute could have\r\n  been a mistake.Â  The State also acknowledged that someone had to make a\r\n  decision between the statute and CDR code, as to what the judge intended on the\r\n  sentencing sheet, and it appeared SCDOC made a decision based on the CDR code.Â \r\n  Further, the State conceded that the CDR code is an administrative listing of\r\n  violations.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the South Carolina Code of Laws is the controlling authority for\r\n  classifications, definitions and penalties for criminal offenses, a statute listed\r\n  on a sentencing sheet, and not a CDR code, will dictate a criminal's sentence.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find Bennett was sentenced as a first offender.Â  Bennett's\r\n  warrant, indictment, and sentencing sheet all list S.C. Code Â§ 44-53-375(B)(1), indicating a first offense.Â \r\n  The additional listing of the CDR code on Bennett's sentencing sheet,\r\n  indicating a second offense, may not trump the listed statute.Â  Due to SCDOC's\r\n  erroneous interpretation of Bennett's sentencing sheet, Bennett has served more\r\n  than the original sentence of four years and should be released from CSP.Â \r\n  Therefore, we remand to the circuit court for an order consistent with this\r\n  opinion.\r\nIII.\r\nLastly, the State contends that Bennett's failure to raise this argument in his first CSP\r\n  violation hearing results in a waiver of his right to raise it in the current\r\n  CSP violation hearing.Â  The issue of\r\n  waiver was raised but not ruled upon below, and we decline to address the\r\n  issue.Â  See I'On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000)\r\n  (holding when reversing a lower court's decision it is within an appellate\r\n  court's discretion as to whether to address any additional sustaining grounds); see also Gecy v. Bagwell, 372 S.C.\r\n  237, 243-44, 642 S.E.2d 569, 572 (2007) (declining to address an additional\r\n  sustaining ground); and Vaught v. A.O.

Code Â§\r\n  44-53-375(B)(1) (2002), and has since\r\n  been amended by 2005 Act No. 127, eff June 7, 2005, found in &nbsp;S.C. Code Â§\r\n  44-53-375(B)(1) (Supp. 2006).\r\n[2] A Class E felony is a parolable offense and thereby\r\n  not restricted by S.C. Code Â§ 24-13-100 which prohibits the parole or early\r\n  release, including CSP, for prisoners convicted of a Class A, B, or C Felony\r\n  until they have served 85 percent of their sentences.\r\n[3] Bennett\r\n  did not contest the alleged\r\n  violations of his CSP at his hearing or on appeal.\r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-27-20(a) (2003) states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Any\r\n    person who has been convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime and who claims:\r\n    (1) That the conviction or the sentence was in violation of the Constitution of\r\n    the United States or the Constitution or laws of this State;\r\n    (2) That the court was without jurisdiction to impose sentence;\r\n    (3) That the sentence exceeds the maximum authorized by law;\r\n    (4) That there exists evidence of material facts, not previously presented and\r\n    heard, that requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in the interest of\r\n    justice;\r\n    (5) That his sentence has expired, his probation, parole or conditional release\r\n    unlawfully revoked, or he is otherwise unlawfully held in custody or other\r\n    restraint; or\r\n    (6) That the conviction or sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack\r\n    upon any ground of alleged error heretofore available under any common law,\r\n    statutory or other writ, motion, petition, proceeding or remedy; may institute,\r\n    without paying a filing fee, a proceeding under this chapter to secure relief.

Pleasant, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: International Fidelity Insurance Company (Surety) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order granting summary judgment to China Construction America (SC), Inc.\r\n  (Contractor) on Suretyâ€™s action seeking payment of contract funds. Â We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\n On May 26, 1999, Contractor entered into a general construction contract with Haier\r\n  Corporation to build a large manufacturing facility in Camden, South Carolina.Â  Contractor subcontracted the electrical work to Electrical Maintenance\r\n  Technicians (Subcontractor).Â  As a precondition of the subcontract, Contractor\r\n  required Subcontractor to post performance and payment bonds in the sum of the\r\n  full subcontract, $1,331,167.22.Â  On October 19, 1999, Surety issued the bonds\r\n  on behalf of Subcontractor, which named Contractor as the third party\r\n  beneficiary.Â Â  Â Â \r\nDuring the project,\r\n  Subcontractor became insolvent, and several of Subcontractorâ€™s suppliers and\r\n  subcontractors filed mechanicâ€™s liens.Â  Subcontractor failed to complete the\r\n  subcontract on time, delaying the project for eighty-three days.Â  Contractor\r\n  demanded that Subcontractor and Surety discharge the liens pursuant to their\r\n  obligations.Â  When the liens were not immediately bonded off, Contractor\r\n  brought a civil action against Subcontractor, Surety, and the three lien\r\n  creditors. Â Contractor sought breach of contract damages against Subcontractor\r\n  and Surety; a declaration of Suretyâ€™s obligation to discharge the liens; and a\r\n  determination of the relative rights of the lien creditors to the subcontract\r\n  retainage.Â  Ultimately, Surety bonded off the liens and paid Subcontractorâ€™s\r\n  lien creditors such that Contractorâ€™s only remaining claim was a breach of\r\n  contract claim against Subcontractor.Â  \r\nOn the day of trial,\r\n  Subcontractor failed to appear, and Surety moved to be dismissed from the case\r\n  without prejudice.Â  Contractor consented to Suretyâ€™s request and proceeded to\r\n  try its breach of contract claim against Subcontractor.Â  The circuit court\r\n  found in favor of Contractor, holding Subcontractor liable for delay in\r\n  completion of the project and for Subcontractorâ€™s failure to perform pursuant\r\n  to the terms of the subcontract. Â At the circuit courtâ€™s request, counsel for\r\n  Contractor prepared a draft order. Â Counsel for Surety requested a copy of the\r\n  order after it was executed and suggested non-substantive changes concerning\r\n  the involvement of Surety in the proceeding. Â Contractor consented to the\r\n  proposed changes, and the circuit court issued an amended order granting\r\n  judgment for Contractor against Subcontractor in the amount of $660,250.51.Â \r\n  This judgment was not appealed. \r\nSometime after\r\n  Contractor filed its action, Surety filed a separate action against Contractor\r\n  seeking the balance of the subcontract as Subcontractorâ€™s subrogated surety.Â  Contractor\r\n  counterclaimed averring the judgment against Subcontractor was binding and\r\n  conclusive on its surety, and as a matter of law, Contractor was entitled to\r\n  judgment against Surety for the full amount of the judgment against\r\n  Subcontractor.Â  In response, Surety argued the prior judgment was not binding\r\n  because it was beyond the scope and coverage of the bond and that there were\r\n  issues of fact as to whether the judgment in the previous case was obtained by\r\n  fraud or collusion.Â  Additionally, Surety claimed three theories of estoppel,\r\n  collateral, judicial, and equitable, applied to prevent Contractor from\r\n  asserting its counterclaims.Â  Both parties moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit\r\n  court granted Contractorâ€™s motion for summary judgment finding the prior\r\n  judgment against Subcontractor was binding on Surety as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Further, the court found no merit to Suretyâ€™s allegations of fraud and\r\n  collusion.Â  Lastly, the court held Suretyâ€™s estoppel arguments were without\r\n  merit. Â This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the\r\n  grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard of\r\n  review as the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis,\r\n  366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Â Helms\r\n    Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488\r\n  (2005).Â  To determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing\r\n  court must consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368\r\n  S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  When plain, palpable, and\r\n  indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary\r\n  judgment should be granted.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595\r\n  S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â \r\n  Conclusiveness of the Bond\r\nSurety\r\n  argues the trial court erred in its determination that the judgment against\r\n  Subcontractor was conclusive and covered within the scope of the bond.Â  Surety\r\n  attacks the conclusiveness of the prior judgment on its obligations under the\r\n  bond, arguing the amount of damages awarded was beyond the scope of the bond.[1]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, a judgment against a principal is binding and conclusive on a surety.Â  Ward\r\n  v. Fed. Co., 233 S.C. 561, 106 S.E.2d 169 (1958).Â  In Ward, the\r\n  supreme court addressed the effect of a prior judgment against a principal on\r\n  subsequent litigation against the surety.Â  Id.Â  The court stated: \r\nAs a\r\n  general rule, in all cases where the liability of a surety is dependent on the\r\n  outcome of litigation in which his principal is or may be involved, a judgment\r\n  against a principal is binding and conclusive on the surety, and the surety may\r\n  not impose defenses which should or might have been set up in the action in\r\n  which the judgment was recovered, or require proof of the facts on which the\r\n  judgment rests, or attack the validity of the judgment, except for fraud or\r\n  collusion or want of jurisdiction. The rule is applicable even though the\r\n  surety had no notice of the suit or opportunity to defend.Â  \r\nWard, 233 S.C. at 564, 106 S.E.2d at 170 (citing 72 C.J.S. Principal and Surety Â§261).\r\nThis issue was most\r\n  recently addressed in this courtâ€™s opinion in Cooper v. Beauliau, 310\r\n  S.C. 392, 426 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  In that case, Cooper obtained a\r\n  judgment against an auto dealer and sought to recover against dealerâ€™s surety.Â  Id. at 393-94, 426 S.E.2d at 820.Â  The surety argued it had no notice\r\n  of the action, the prior judgment was not binding, and the prior damage award\r\n  was beyond the scope of the bond coverage.Â  Citing Ward as controlling\r\n  authority, this court refused to revisit the issue of damages and liability\r\n  absent any suggestion of fraud, collusion, or want of jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 394, 426 S.E.2d at 820.Â  We further noted that the surety and principalâ€™s\r\n  liability was joint and several, and therefore, suretyâ€™s lack of notice and\r\n  participation in the previous suit between the claimant and principal was of no\r\n  consequence.Â  Id.Â  Importantly, the court found no merit in plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  argument that the damages award exceeded the scope of the bond.Â  Id. at 395, 426 S.E.2d at 821. \r\nAs\r\n  in Cooper, we hold this matter is controlled by Ward, our supreme\r\n  courtâ€™s most recent precedent in this area. Â Therefore, absent fraud,\r\n  collusion, or lack of jurisdiction, which Surety concedes are not at issue\r\n  here, Surety may not now argue defenses which should or might have been raised\r\n  in the action in which the judgment was recovered, especially where Surety had\r\n  notice and an opportunity to defend in that action.[2] Â As a result, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment to\r\n  Contractor.[3]\r\nII.Â \r\n  Equitable Estoppel\r\nSurety also claims\r\n  the trial court erred in finding Contractor was not equitably estopped from\r\n  asserting Surety was liable for the prior judgment against Subcontractor.Â \r\n  Specifically, Surety argues Contractorâ€™s agreement to dismiss Surety without\r\n  prejudice from the action against Subcontractor amounted to a false\r\n  representation or concealment on which Surety could properly rely.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nInitially, a\r\n  dismissal of a claim without prejudice is not an adjudication of the merits of\r\n  the controversy and has no preclusive effect as a matter of law.Â  See, e.g.,Â  McEachern v. Black, 329 S.C. 642, 651, 496 S.E.2d 659, 663 (1998). Â Therefore,\r\n  Contractorâ€™s consent to Suretyâ€™s motion to dismiss without prejudice does not\r\n  equate to a false representation or concealment on which Surety could rely to\r\n  change its position.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not err in holding\r\n  Contractor was not equitably estopped from asserting Surety was liable for the\r\n  prior judgment against Subcontractor.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â \r\n  WaiverÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSurety\r\n  claims the trial court erred in finding there were no material facts in dispute\r\n  on the issue of waiver.Â  Surety asserts Contractor waived its rights to pursue\r\n  or assert any further causes of action against Surety when Contractor agreed to\r\n  dismiss Surety without prejudice.Â  The issue of waiver was not raised or ruled\r\n  upon below, and therefore, we find the issue is not adequately preserved for\r\n  review.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues must be raised and ruled upon in\r\n  the trial court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nIV.Â \r\n  Judicial Estoppel\r\nLastly,\r\n  Surety argues Contractor took inconsistent positions during the course of the\r\n  case and should, therefore, be judicially estopped from asserting its claim\r\n  against Surety. Â We find this issue not preserved for appellate review. \r\nOn appeal, Surety\r\n  argues Contractorâ€™s inconsistent positions pertain to the damages sought in its\r\n  original action.Â  However, Surety argued to the circuit court that Contractorâ€™s\r\n  inconsistent positions pertained to Contractorâ€™s consent to dismiss Surety from\r\n  the original action.Â  Surety did not properly raise this issue to the circuit court,\r\n  and therefore, we find it is not adequately preserved for our review.Â  See B &amp; A Development, Inc. v. Georgetown County, 372 S.C. 261, 271, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 888, 894 (2007) (holding that issues must be raised and ruled upon in\r\n  the trial court to be preserved for appellate review). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Surety argued at trial that the prior judgment was\r\n  not binding because it was beyond the scope and coverage of the bond and, in\r\n  the alternative, that Contractor obtained its judgment through a fraud\r\n  perpetrated on the court.Â  On appeal, Surety concedes that there is no issue of\r\n  fraud or collusion, but maintains that the prior judgment was beyond the scope\r\n  of its surety obligation.Â  \r\n[2] The logic of this rule is most aptly summarized in Vigilanti\r\n  v. Pfieffer-Nuemeyer Constr. Corp., 25 F. Supp. 403, 404-05 (E.D.N.Y 1938): \r\n\r\n  A\r\n    surety cannot stand idly by with full knowledge of an action pending against\r\n    its principal, permit a judgment to be taken against its principal, and later\r\n    on, when an action is brought upon its bond, require the plaintiff to retry his\r\n    case.Â  This would result in two trials on the same issue.Â  It would retard and\r\n    not promote the administration of justice.Â  \r\n\r\n[3] Because we hold this matter is controlled by the\r\n  precedent of Ward and Cooper, we need not address Suretyâ€™s\r\n  argument regarding L.B. Price Mercantile Co. v. Redd, 231 S.C. 446, 99\r\n  S.E.2d 57 (1957).Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating the appellate\r\n  court need not address remaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4289","title":"Floyd v.

Jacobs, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â Â  4289\r\n  Submitted May 1, 2007 â€“ Filed August 23,\r\n  2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        J. Mark Taylor and Katherine Carruth Link, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Richard Giles Whiting and Spencer Andrew Syrett, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  Richard Morgan (Father) appeals from a\r\n  family court order granting Sherrie Jean Floydâ€™s (Mother) request for a child\r\n  support reduction.Â  Father further argues the family court erred in modifying a\r\n  contractual term of the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement, and in denying his request\r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 2000, the family court granted Father a\r\n  divorce from Mother on the ground of adultery.Â  Pursuant to an agreement of the\r\n  parties, the court granted sole custody of the partiesâ€™ two minor children to Father,\r\n  and visitation in excess of 109 overnights per year to Mother.Â  Mother agreed\r\n  to pay child support in the amount of $920 per month.Â  The amount of child\r\n  support was calculated by the parties pursuant to Worksheet A of the South\r\n  Carolina Child Support Guidelines (the guidelines).Â  Mother also agreed to pay\r\n  Father $17,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  All of these provisions were part\r\n  of a negotiated settlement agreement approved by the family court and\r\n  incorporated into the divorce decree.Â  \r\nIn May 2004, Mother sought sole custody of\r\n  the children or, alternatively, a shared or joint custody arrangement.Â  Mother\r\n  also sought modification of her child support.Â  Upon request of both Father and\r\n  Mother, the court appointed a guardian ad litem for the children.Â  Father and\r\n  Mother agreed that because Fatherâ€™s income had increased and Motherâ€™s income had\r\n  decreased, they would temporarily reduce Motherâ€™s child support payment from\r\n  $920 to $808 per month while the action was pending. Â This reduction was\r\n  approved by the court. Â Again in 2006, Father and Mother agreed to modify their\r\n  original agreement as to visitation, but not materially modifying the number of\r\n  overnight visits the mother had with the children.\r\nHowever, the parties did not reach an agreement as to\r\n  two issues: (1) Motherâ€™s request to permanently modify child support, and (2)\r\n  both Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s requests for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The parties\r\n  disputed whether child support should be calculated in accordance with Worksheet\r\n  A (for sole custody) or Worksheet C (for shared custody) of the guidelines.[2]\r\nIn June 2006, the court granted Motherâ€™s\r\n  request to modify the provisions of the divorce decree regarding child support,\r\n  finding the changes in the partiesâ€™ incomes and the elimination of child care\r\n  expenses in the amount of $544.00 per month constituted a change of\r\n  circumstances. Â The court further held that it would exercise its discretion\r\n  and calculate Motherâ€™s new child support obligation utilizing Worksheet C of\r\n  the guidelines, instead of Worksheet A.Â  Utilizing the guidelines, the court\r\n  reduced Motherâ€™s child support obligation to $152 per month.Â  The court\r\n  additionally ordered that each party be responsible for his or her own\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with our\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the\r\n  family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d\r\n  610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522\r\n  S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Modification of Child Support\r\nFather contends the family court erred in granting\r\n  Motherâ€™s request for a\r\n  reduction in child support when there was no evidence to support the courtâ€™s\r\n  finding of a change in circumstances with respect to the level of Motherâ€™s\r\n  overnight visitation.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court may always modify child support upon\r\n  a proper showing of a change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting\r\n  parentâ€™s financial ability.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 26, 624\r\n  S.E.2d 643, 647-48 (2006) (citing Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 351,\r\n  306 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1983)).Â  The party seeking the modification has the burden\r\n  to show changed circumstances.Â  Id. at 26, 624 S.E.2d at 648.Â  This\r\n  burden is increased where the child support award is based on a settlement\r\n  agreement.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, changes within the contemplation of the\r\n  parties at the time of the initial decree are not sufficient bases for the\r\n  modification of a child support award.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the family court placed great\r\n  emphasis on the substantial changes in the partiesâ€™ incomes.Â  In its June 14,\r\n  2006 order, the court noted that at the time of the divorce in 2000, Father\r\n  earned $4000 per month in income, while Mother earned $4067.Â  By the time of\r\n  the initial hearing in 2004, Fatherâ€™s monthly income increased 29% to $5150,\r\n  while Motherâ€™s income only increased 18% to $4800.Â  By 2005, Fatherâ€™s income\r\n  increased again to $5421, while Motherâ€™s income decreased to $4785.Â  Then, at\r\n  the time of the final hearing in 2006, Fatherâ€™s income increased to $5700,\r\n  while Motherâ€™s income increased back to $4800.Â  The court concluded that in\r\n  2006, Fatherâ€™s income increased 43% from 2000, while Motherâ€™s income increased\r\n  only 18% between 2000 and 2006.Â  Additionally, the court noted that child care\r\n  expenses, which were apparently paid by Father, no longer existed and that the medical\r\n  expenses had not changed substantially since the 2000 decree.\r\nWe agree with the family court that the above\r\n  mentioned changes were significant enough to support a finding of a substantial\r\n  or material change of circumstances warranting a modification of child support.\r\n  Â See Rogers v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 540 S.E. 2d 840 (2001) (holding\r\n  Fatherâ€™s 21% increase in income, as compared to Motherâ€™s 8% increase in income,\r\n  together with increased child care expenses warranted increase in child\r\n  support).\r\nII.Â  Calculation of Amount of Child Support\r\nFather contends the family court erred in modifying a\r\n  contractual term of the partiesâ€™ negotiated settlement agreement, from the use\r\n  of Worksheet A to Worksheet C to govern Motherâ€™s child support obligation,\r\n  inasmuch as theÂ  Motherâ€™s overnight visitation did not materially change. Â We\r\n  disagree.\r\n Whether\r\n  or not the family court had discretion upon a finding of change of\r\n  circumstances to change the method of calculating child support, utilizing a\r\n  different guidelines worksheet when there was no material change in the number\r\n  of overnight visits, is a novel issue in South Carolina. Â As previously stated,\r\n  ordinarily, a party seeking to modify an existing child support obligation has\r\n  the burden of establishing changed circumstances.Â  Upchurch, 367 S.C. at\r\n  26, 624 S.E.2d at 648.Â  To warrant a change in child support, the change of\r\n  circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  Townsend v. Townsend,\r\n  356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Annotated section 20-7-852(A) (Supp. 2006) states that â€œ[i]n any\r\n  proceeding for the award of child support, there is a rebuttable presumption\r\n  that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the\r\n  guidelines required under section 43-5-580(b) is the correct amount of child\r\n  support to be awarded.â€ Â A different amount may be awarded only â€œupon a showing\r\n  that application of the guidelines in a particular case would be unjust or\r\n  inappropriate.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, â€œ[w]hen the court orders a child support\r\n  award that varies significantly from the amount resulting from the application\r\n  of the guidelines, the court shall make specific, written findings of those\r\n  facts upon which it bases its conclusion supporting that award.â€ Â Id.Â  Section 20-7-852(C) (Supp. 2006) states a court â€œshallâ€ consider certain\r\n  factors which â€œ. . . may be used in determining whether a change of\r\n  circumstances has occurred which would require a modification of an existing\r\n  order.â€ Â Among other reasons, section 20-7-852(C)(11) states the court may\r\n  consider â€œsubstantial disparity of incomes in which the noncustodial parentâ€™s\r\n  income is significantly less than the custodial parentâ€™s income, thus making it\r\n  financially impractical to pay what the guidelines indicate the noncustodial\r\n  parent should pay.â€\r\nRegulation\r\n  114-4720 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides the court can determine\r\n  the total child support obligation by adding the basic child support as\r\n  provided in the guidelines to health insurance premiums and child care costs. Â Thereafter,\r\n  â€œthe total child support obligation is divided between the parents in\r\n  proportion to their incomes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(15)(a) (Supp.\r\n  2006). Â There is no contention by the parties that the trial court did not\r\n  properly compute each parentâ€™s child support obligation based upon a literal\r\n  application of the guidelines.\r\nFurther,\r\n  regulation 114-4730(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides that â€œ[w]hen\r\n  both parents are deemed fit, and other relevant logistical circumstances apply,\r\n  shared custody should be encouraged . . . .â€ Â The regulation states further\r\n  that shared custody adjustments are advisory, not mandatory. Â Id.Â \r\n  Additionally, if each parent has court-ordered visitation with the children\r\n  overnight for more than 109 nights each year and both parents contribute to the\r\n  expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support, the court\r\n  may make a â€œshared custody adjustment,â€ which â€œshall be calculated using\r\n  Worksheet C.â€Â  Id.Â  The regulation goes on to explain that â€œif the 109\r\n  overnights threshold is reached for shared physical custody, this adjustment\r\n  may be applied even if one parent has sole legal custody.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn 2000, at the\r\n  time Father and Mother entered into the agreement in question, Motherâ€™s\r\n  visitations were approximately 147 overnights visits per year, which was\r\n  clearly in excess of the 109 overnight visits required to put into play the\r\n  shared parenting provisions of the guidelines.Â  Despite the number of overnight\r\n  visits granted, Mother agreed to pay Father $920 per month in child support\r\n  based upon figures set forth in an attached â€œChild Support Obligation:\r\n  Worksheet A.â€Â  Although Motherâ€™s attorney argued to the trial court in\r\n  this case that the Mother knew nothing about the various worksheets when she\r\n  signed the 2000 agreement, the agreement declares both parties entered into the\r\n  agreement freely, not under duress or undue influence, and that they actively\r\n  took part in the negotiations. Â Additionally, the family court found the\r\n  agreement to be fair, equitable and reasonable, and approved the agreement as\r\n  incorporated and merged into the divorce decree.Â  Nevertheless, the 2000 decree\r\n  does not explain why there was a deviation from the amount that should have\r\n  presumably been awarded by application of the guidelines.Â  Nor, did the decree\r\n  or agreement in any way bind the parties to the use of worksheet A in future\r\n  child support calculations based on a change of circumstances. \r\nIn\r\n  the groundbreaking 1983 case of Moseley v. Mosier, supra, our\r\n  supreme court stated in rather specific terms that â€œfamily courts have\r\n  continuing jurisdiction to do whatever is in the best interest of the child\r\n  regardless of what the separation agreement specified.â€Â  Moseley, 279\r\n  S.C. at 351, 306 S.E.2d at 626.Â  Moreover, it is clear that a merged child\r\n  support agreement loses its contractual character after it is judicially decreed\r\n  as mandated by Moseley. Â Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 214, 603\r\n  S.E.2d 598, 601-03 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nWhile\r\n  no South Carolina case touches upon the scenario of this case, the North Carolina case of Beamer v. Beamer, 610 S.E.2d 220 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005),\r\n  reflects on how our sister state views the matter. Â In Beamer, the court\r\n  reversed the trial court deviation from the guidelines for lack of specific\r\n  findings of fact to support the â€œ(1) the reasonable needs of the children and\r\n  (2) the basis for the amount of child support ultimately awarded.â€ Â Id. at 221.Â  Procedurally, the court stated, however, that â€œ[o]nce a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances has been shown by the party seeking modification, the\r\n  trial court then â€˜proceeds to follow the Guidelines and to compute the\r\n  appropriate amount of child support.â€™ â€ Â Id. at 222 (citing Davis v.\r\n    Risley, 411 S.E.2d 171, 173 (N.C. Ct. App. 1991)).\r\nThe\r\n  parties are in agreement that Mother has custody of the children approximately\r\n  147 overnights per year or roughly 40% of the time. Â The idea behind the\r\n  adjustments for shared custody is that the party having custody of the children\r\n  during a certain time period will take care of most of the childrenâ€™s needs\r\n  during the time he/she has custody. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  114-4730(A).Â  As we read the statute and regulation, they presume that the\r\n  appropriate amount of support in a shared parenting arrangement is the amount\r\n  resulting from an application of the guidelines. Â Since neither party claims\r\n  the trial judge should have deviated from the guidelines due to any of the\r\n  statutory reasons set forth in section 20-7-852(C),[3] or that the modification of Motherâ€™s support obligation will somehow adversely\r\n  affect the welfare of the children, we think it was simply a mathematical\r\n  calculation on the part of the trial court to establish support based on the\r\n  guidelines. Â Therefore, we hold the trial court had discretion to apply the guidelines\r\n  then in effect upon a showing of a substantial change of circumstances.\r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFather contends the family court erred in denying him\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees when he was the prevailing party with respect to the issues\r\n  raised in this action.Â  We disagree.\r\nAttorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in the family court.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2005); Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C.\r\n  515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004). The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within\r\n  the discretion of the court.Â  Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 31, 590\r\n  S.E.2d 495, 502 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The family courtâ€™s decision regarding\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Green\r\n    v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 353, 465 S.E.2d 130, 134 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nIn\r\n  deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider:\r\n  (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees; (2) the beneficial results\r\n  obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial condition of each party; and\r\n  (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Upchurch,\r\n  367 S.C. at 28, 624 S.E.2d at 648-49; Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C.\r\n  255, 269, 621 S.E.2d 389, 396 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nHere,\r\n  Mother brought this action for a change in custody.Â  Although the parties\r\n  settled the custody aspect of the case, we have concluded the family court did\r\n  not err in reducing Motherâ€™s child support.Â  We thus hold that neither party\r\n  prevailed.Â  In any event, the family court ordered that each party be\r\n  responsible for his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. We therefore find\r\n  that the family court did not err in denying Father attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the family court did\r\n  not err by granting Motherâ€™s request for a reduction in child support.Â  We also\r\n  find the family court did not err by modifying a contractual term of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ negotiated settlement agreement, from the use of Worksheet A to Worksheet\r\n  C of the child support guidelines, to govern Motherâ€™s child support obligation.\r\n  Â Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\nSHORT, J.,\r\n  dissents in part and concurs in part in a separate opinion.\r\nSHORT, J. (dissenting in part and concurring in part):Â  I would reverse the family courtâ€™s\r\n  recalculation of child support utilizing Worksheet C in place of the originally\r\n  agreed upon Worksheet A of the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (the\r\n  Guidelines), and for that reason, I respectfully dissent.Â  I adopt the\r\n  majorityâ€™s facts and standard of review, but I disagree with the analysis and\r\n  would find as follows.\r\nThe majority utilizes Upchurch v. Upchurch for\r\n  the proposition that the family court may always modify child support upon a\r\n  proper showing of change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting parentâ€™s\r\n  financial ability.Â  367 S.C. 16, 26, 624 S.E.2d 643, 647-48 (2006).Â  While I\r\n  agree with the majority that due to significant changes in the partiesâ€™ income,\r\n  a modification of the child support amount was appropriate, I find this\r\n  modification should have been calculated under Worksheet A of the\r\n  Guidelines.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn an August 30, 2000 order (the 2000 order), the\r\n  family court fully approved, incorporated and merged the partiesâ€™ custody,\r\n  support and property settlement agreement into its order.Â  This agreement\r\n  called for Mother to pay â€œFather the amount of $920.00 per month in child\r\n  support based upon figures set forth in the attached Child Support Obligation\r\n  Worksheet A.â€Â Â  The family court found that the parties had negotiated and\r\n  entered into the agreement with â€œthe benefit of advice and counselâ€ and that\r\n  they â€œfully comprehended its terms and conditions.â€Â  Further, the court found\r\n  each party entered into a â€œfair, equitable, and reasonableâ€ agreement â€œfreely,\r\n  knowingly, voluntarily, and without threats or coercion.â€Â  \r\nI first note that this 2000 order of the family court was\r\n  never appealed.Â  Therefore, it has become the law of the case, and any review\r\n  of the propriety of utilizing Worksheet A, as noted in the partiesâ€™ agreement\r\n  and consequently the courtâ€™s order, would be contrary to our rules of\r\n  preservation.[4]Â \r\n  The majority correctly notes regulation 114-4730(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2006) provides a family court with discretion to apply a â€œshared\r\n  custody adjustmentâ€ which provides for the utilization of Worksheet C to\r\n  calculate child support for parents who have court ordered visitation with a\r\n  child for more than 109 overnights each year.Â  However, to review the family\r\n  courtâ€™s 2000 order for an abuse of discretion error at this juncture would be\r\n  inappropriate.Â  The proper query to be addressed in this matter is whether the\r\n  necessary change of circumstances has occurred to modify the original order by\r\n  calculating child support under Worksheet C instead of Worksheet A.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, even were we to review the propriety of utilizing Worksheet A in\r\n  the 2000 order, I believe this issue fails on its merits.Â  The majority notes\r\n  that the family court failed to provide specific findings of fact to explain\r\n  why it deviated from the Guidelines in calculating the child support owed.Â \r\n  While I agree that were the court to deviate from the Guidelines in its own\r\n  discretion it would have to provide specific findings to justify this action,\r\n  in this matter, the parties agreed to utilize Worksheet A.Â  The parties\r\n  are free to agree on child support which is greater than that as required by\r\n  law.Â  See Ratchford v. Ratchford, 295 S.C. 297, 299, 368 S.E.2d\r\n  214, 215 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œA parent can contractually obligate himself beyond\r\n  the support requirements imposed by law.â€).Â  Where the parties agree to a\r\n  greater amount of support than required by law, I fail to discern why the\r\n  family court should be required to make specific findings of fact to justify\r\n  such deviation from the Guidelines.[5]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRegardless of the propriety of the family courtâ€™s\r\n  application of Worksheet A to calculate child support under the 2000 order, as\r\n  noted above, the family court retains jurisdiction to modify child support upon\r\n  a proper showing of change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting\r\n  parentâ€™s financial ability.Â  â€œWhere there is an agreement regarding child\r\n  support, however, the family court should not decide support issues as if there\r\n  is no agreement.â€Â  Ratchford, 295 S.C. at 299, 368 S.E.2d at 215.Â  The\r\n  parties agreed to calculate the support obligation under Worksheet A, and as\r\n  reflected in the 2000 order, this calculation based on the parties then\r\n  existing income, resulted in an amount of $920.00.Â  While the dollar amount was\r\n  determined through a calculation based on the partiesâ€™ then existing incomes\r\n  and not based on the partiesâ€™ specific assent, the decision to utilize\r\n  Worksheet A was agreed upon by the parties.Â  Consequently, I believe that while\r\n  the dollar amount is modifiable based on changes in the income of the parties,\r\n  I do not find the use of Worksheet A to be modifiable based solely on changes\r\n  in the parties income.[6]Â \r\n  A change in worksheets should be predicated on a change in the visitation such\r\n  that Mother would increase her overnights from an amount less than 109 nights\r\n  to an amount in excess of 109 nights thereby providing the court with discretion\r\n  to apply the shared custody adjustment as noted in regulation 114-4730(A) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  However, it is undisputed that Mother\r\n  was afforded visitation in excess of 109 overnights in the 2000 order.Â \r\n  Consequently, she agreed to calculate her support obligation under Worksheet A\r\n  while already having visitation in excess of 109 overnights per year.Â  Mother\r\n  â€œfreely, knowingly, voluntarily, and without threats or coercionâ€ agreed to\r\n  forego the possibility of a shared custody adjustment.Â  Therefore, we have no\r\n  substantial change in the visitation, and Mother is not entitled to a\r\n  modification of her previously agreed to usage of Worksheet A.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  the majority cites Upchurch for the notion that â€œchanges within the\r\n  contemplation of the parties at the time of the initial decree are not\r\n  sufficient bases for the modification of a child support award.â€Â  367 S.C. at\r\n  26, 624 S.E.2d at 648.Â  I agree and can discern no manner in which one could\r\n  argue Mother, having been afforded over 109 overnights per year by the 2000\r\n  order and thereby potentially being entitled to a shared custody adjustment,\r\n  did not have the use of a particular worksheet within her contemplation when\r\n  she agreed to utilize Worksheet A.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, I would reverse the family courtâ€™s usage of Worksheet C and\r\n  remand the issue of child support for calculation of a proper support\r\n  obligation under the agreed upon Worksheet A.Â  As to the other issues noted in\r\n  this appeal, I concur with the majority.Â Â Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Neither party testified at the hearing before the\r\n  trial court. Â Instead, both partiesâ€™ attorneys made statements to the court,\r\n  which were essentially undisputed by opposing counsel. Â The record on appeal\r\n  contains the affidavit of Fatherâ€™s counsel requesting attorney fees, but we are\r\n  uninformed what other documents, if any, were before the trial court. Â The\r\n  trial courtâ€™s order indicates the Mother submitted some documentation as to\r\n  additional sums she spent on the children over and above the support she paid\r\n  the Father.\r\n[3] We recognize that arguably Father contends the partiesâ€™\r\n  agreement from 2000 is a sufficient basis to not apply the worksheet component\r\n  of the statute, but we read section 20-7-852(C)(13) to apply in the present\r\n  situation to the 2000 support order only, inasmuch as the parties reached no\r\n  agreement as to child support in 2006.\r\n[4] We are mindful that the appellate courts of this\r\n  state have disregarded rules of error preservation where the best interests of\r\n  a child were concerned.Â  See Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000).Â  However, as the majority notes, the changing of\r\n  worksheets in this matter does not effect the interests of the children;Â  â€œit\r\n  was simply a mathematical calculation on the part of the trial court to\r\n  establish support based on the guidelines.â€Â  \r\n[5] The North Carolina Court of Appeals case (Beamer\r\n  v. Beamer, 610 S.E.2d 220 (2005)), utilized by the majority to support its point\r\n  that deviation from the Guidelines must be supported by specific findings of\r\n  fact, is distinguishable from the matter at hand.Â  In the Beamer case,\r\n  there was no agreement by the parties as to which worksheet to apply, and the\r\n  court sua sponte determined it should calculate support in a\r\n  manner not consistent with the North Carolina Guidelines.Â Â Â  \r\n[6] I again note the majorityâ€™s use of Beamer to\r\n  establish that â€œonce a substantial change in circumstances has been shown by\r\n  the party seeking modification, the trial court then â€˜proceeds to follow the\r\n  Guidelines and to compute the appropriate amount of child support.â€™â€Â  This\r\n  intimates that once a substantial change has been found, the court is free to\r\n  change even the worksheet to be used.Â  This may hold true in cases such as Beamer where there is no prior agreement of the parties as to which worksheet to use.Â \r\n  However, in light of the precedent handed down in Ratchford dictating\r\n  that where there is an agreement, the court should not decide support issues as\r\n  if there is no agreement, I find Beamer to be unpersuasive under the\r\n  facts of this case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4290","title":"Maxwell v.

Maxwell (Husband) appeals from the family court's order dismissing his action to terminate the alimony that Lori Maxwell[1] (Wife) was awarded pursuant to a settlement agreement in the parties' prior action for separate maintenance and support.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Husband separated in April 2002, and Wife filed an action for separate maintenance and support in May 2002.Â  Although Wife was the only party represented by counsel, the parties entered into a settlement agreement that was adopted by the family court by final order on June 14, 2002.Â  The agreement granted Wife custody of the parties' three minor children with liberal visitation to Husband.Â  As part of the agreement, Wife was granted unallocated family support of $2,600 per month for ten years and, upon the emancipation of the three minor children, alimony in an amount equal to the unallocated support.Â  The alimony was to be reduced to $1,000 per month in January 2013.Â  The settlement agreement provided that alimony was &quot;non-modifiable and shall continue until the death of the Husband.\"Â  The agreement further provided that: Â (1) if the agreement was adopted by the family court, it would be the final determination of all the financial and marital rights of the parties such that there was no need for the issues to be relitigated in a subsequent divorce action; and (2) the provisions of the agreement could not be modified by the parties or the family court except by mutual written consent of both parties in a formal agreement adopted by the family court.Â  Neither party appealed from the order adopting the settlement agreement.Â \r\n \r\nSometime after the final order issued by the family court adopting the settlement agreement, Husband learned that Wife committed adultery prior to the adoption of the agreement.Â  On May 23, 2003, Husband filed an action for divorce based upon adultery.Â  In the complaint, Husband also requested termination of alimony based upon Wife's pre-agreement adultery.Â  After a bifurcated trial, the family court first granted the parties a divorce based upon the grounds of the separation of the parties without cohabitation for greater than one year.Â  In a separate order, the court considered whether Husband was barred from seeking termination of alimony.Â  The court dismissed Husband's claim to terminate alimony with prejudice, finding:Â  (1) Husband failed to raise or plead the avoidance or affirmative defense of adultery to Wife's claim for alimony in the separation agreement, and thus, he was barred from raising it in a subsequent action; (2) Husband's claims were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel; and (3) the separation agreement provided that alimony was non-modifiable, and thus, the family court could not terminate alimony.Â  Husband's motion for reconsideration was denied, and he appeals.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family court's findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  &quot;Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.\"Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Dorchester County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family court's findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of his burden to convince this court that the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in dismissing his action to terminate alimony because adultery is listed as an absolute bar to alimony pursuant to statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhether to award alimony is a decision within the sound discretion of the family court judge and the decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The South Carolina Code provides for an award of alimony in amounts for such terms as the family court considers appropriate and just, considering the parties' circumstances, and the circumstances of the case.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2006).Â  The statute further provides:\r\n\r\n\tNo alimony may be awarded a spouse who commits adultery before the earliest of these two events:Â  (1) the formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement or (2) entry of a permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between the parties.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The statutory bar on alimony due to adultery, however, is not absolute.Â  See RGM v. DEM, 306 S.C. 145, 150, 410 S.E.2d 564, 567 (1991) (noting that while condonation is a defense to the statutory bar of alimony due to adultery, recrimination is not); Doe v. Doe, 286 S.C. 507, 512, 334 S.E.2d 829, 832 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding that husband could not avail himself of the statute barring alimony to an adulterous spouse where husband condoned wife's adultery, and thus wife was still eligible for alimony). \r\n \r\nFurther, the parties may enter a settlement agreement making the payment of alimony non-modifiable and not subject to subsequent modification by the family court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2006) (stating that the family court may review and approve all agreements bearing on support issues, including alimony, and that the parties &quot;may agree in writing if properly approved by the court to make the payment of alimony as set forth in items (1) through (6) of subsection (B) nonmodifiable and not subject to subsequent modification by the court\").[2]Â  &quot;While the family court normally has the authority to modify alimony, once an alimony agreement that specifically disallows modification is approved by the court and merged into a judicial order, it is binding on the parties and the court and is not subject to modification.\"Â  Degenhart, 360 S.C. at 500-01, 602 S.E.2d at 98.Â  The family court &quot;must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the parties' failure to guard their rights carefully.\"Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 340, 491 S.E.2d 583, 589 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n \r\nIn the present case, the parties' agreement specifically provided that it was not modifiable by the parties or by the family court unless both parties agreed in writing to modify it by a formal procedure in the family court.Â  Because the terms of the agreement provide that it is non-modifiable, it is irrelevant that Wife committed adultery prior to signing the separation agreement and that the statute bars alimony to an adulterous spouse.Â  The agreement &quot;overrides\" the statutory bar to alimony.Â  Degenhart, 360 S.C. at 500-01, 602 S.E.2d at 98.Â  Thus, we find no error in the family court's decision to dismiss the action to terminate alimony.[3] \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the underlying settlement agreement between the parties provided that it was non-modifiable, we find the family court did not err in dismissing Husband's action to terminate the alimony award in the agreement.Â  Accordingly, the family court's order is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Wife now goes by the name &quot;Lori Lette.\"Â \r\n \r\n[2]Â  We note that this subsection was not cited by the family court judge in reaching his decision.Â  However, this section was in existence at the time the underlying action for termination of alimony was filed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n \r\n[3]Â  Because we affirm the family court on this issue, we decline to address Husband's remaining grounds on appeal.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding that the court need not rule on remaining issues when the disposition of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4291","title":"Robbins v.

Sims, Jr., of Columbia, Mary Sowell League, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In this workers' compensation case, Bryan Robbins appeals from the circuit court's order affirming the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission's denial of his claim for additional compensation based on a change of condition, arguing:Â  (1) he sustained a change of condition within the meaning of the act; and (2) he is entitled to additional medical benefits, including surgery, even if he did not sustain a change of condition because the treatment would tend to lessen his period of disability.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nRobbins was the assistant manager at a Walgreens pharmacy in Sumter.Â  On April 13, 2003, he injured his lower back while stacking cases of two-liter sodas on a cart.Â  He reported the injury to his employer, filed a workers' compensation claim, and received compensation for his injury.Â  Robbins was placed on disability for two weeks and then allowed to return to work on light duty with weight restrictions.Â  Robbins was prescribed physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, and muscle relaxers.Â  His treating physician, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Rakesch Chokshi, diagnosed Robbins with degenerative disc disease at levels L1-2 and L2-3, with foraminal compression causing lumbar spine radiculopathy, and lumbar stenosis.Â  Dr. Chokshi released Robbins at maximum medical improvement with no work restrictions on September 24, 2003, with a 10% permanent impairment rating.Â  Robbins returned to work with some residual symptoms.Â  Although Robbins claimed his back pain slowly worsened after returning to work, Robbins settled his workers' compensation claim with Walgreens on March 12, 2004.Â  Robbins was terminated from his employment with Walgreens for unspecified reasons on April 12, 2004.Â \r\n \r\nApril 16, 2004, Robbins went to his family physician complaining of back pain that never abated from the prior accident at work.Â  He was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease with radiculopathy.Â  Robbins returned to Dr. Chokshi, who diagnosed him with decreased lumbar motion secondary to facet arthropathy and degenerative changes and recommended further treatment.Â  Dr. Chokshi recommended that Robbins not work. Â On May 11, 2004, Robbins filed a Form 50 request for a hearing based on a change in condition to his back and leg and requesting further treatment.Â  Robbins sought treatment with Dr. Jefferey Wingate, who also diagnosed Robbins with disc degeneration at L1-2 and L2-3 with loss of disc height and signal.Â  Robbins, who had begun to work for Walden Books part-time and began taking night classes, told Dr. Wingate that his back is &quot;shot&quot; after working.Â  Dr. Wingate recommended further treatment, including discography, epidural injections, and a lumbar fusion.Â Â \r\n \r\nAt the hearing, Robbins testified that his back pain was &quot;much worse&quot; than it was at the time he settled his original claim.Â  He also stated that his back pain was not resolved before he settled his claim, but he was afraid to inform his employer or request additional treatment for fear of being terminated.Â  Although he admitted that his current employment with Walden Books exhausted him, he denied that it exacerbated his condition.Â Â \r\n \r\nThe single commissioner denied Robbins' claim, finding the &quot;greater weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the Claimant suffered a physical change of condition for the worse arising out of the original injury.&quot; Â The single commissioner found Robbins' complaints and the results of his MRI taken before the settlement agreement were essentially the same as his complaints and the MRI taken for the change in condition action.Â  Thus, the single commissioner found Robbins failed to prove that he sustained a significant change in condition such that he would be entitled to further compensation or treatment.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner's decision.Â  Â \r\nRobbins appealed to the circuit court, and after a hearing, the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel's decision.Â  The court found that the Appellate Panel correctly concluded that Robbins failed to carry his burden of proof that he sustained a physical change of condition for the worse arising out of his original injury.Â  The court further found that Robbins' argument that he should be awarded continuing treatment to lessen his period of disability was not preserved because he failed to request continuing treatment for his initial injury at the time of the original settlement agreement and failed to request continuing treatment in his underlying action before the single commissioner.Â  Robbins appeals.Â  Â \r\n&nbsp;STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission. Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Â &quot;In workers' compensation cases, the [Appellate Panel] is the ultimate fact finder.&quot; Â Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The Appellate Panel is specifically reserved the task of assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded evidence. Â Id. \r\n \r\nThus, this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Therrell v. Jerry's Inc., 370 S.C. 22, 25, 633 S.E.2d 893, 894 (2006).Â  &quot;[T]his Court may reverse or modify the [Panel's] decision if Petitioner has suffered the appropriate degree of prejudice and the commission's decision is effected by an error of law or is â€˜clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.'&quot; Â Id. at 25, 633 S.E.2d at 894-95 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(2005)).Â  &quot;It is not within our province to reverse findings of the [Appellate Panel] which are supported by substantial evidence.&quot; Â Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached.&quot;Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996).Â  The mere possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 353, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Change of condition\r\nRobbins argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel because:Â  (1) the undisputed evidence was that Dr. Chokshi took Robbins out of work due to his back pain in April 2004, entitling him to additional compensation; (2) the Appellate Panel erred in requiring a &quot;significant&quot; change in condition; and (3) the Panel's findings were not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nA claimant may seek to reopen an award under the Workers' Compensation Act if there has been a change in condition.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90 (1985) (providing that, upon the motion of any party based upon a change of condition, any award may be reviewed and thereafter diminished or increased).Â  &quot;The purpose of this section is to enable the [Appellate Panel] to change the amount of compensation, including increasing compensation when circumstances indicate a change of condition for the worse.&quot; Â Clark v. Aiken County Gov't, 366 S.C. 102, 108, 620 S.E.2d 99, 102 (Ct. App. 2005). Â &quot;A change in condition occurs when the claimant experiences a change in physical condition as a result of her original injury, occurring after the first award.&quot;Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # 10420, 353 S.C. 100, 109, 576 S.E.2d 191, 196 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, the issue before the Appellate Panel is &quot;sharply restricted to the question of extent of improvement or worsening of the injury on which the original award was based.&quot;Â  Id. \r\n \r\nWe believe there was substantial evidence to support the denial of Robbins' claim of a change in condition.Â  The MRI taken before Robbins' original claim for compensation showed he had degenerative disc disease at levels L1-2 and L2-3, with foraminal compression causing lumbar spine radiculopathy and lumbar stenosis.Â  The MRI taken by Dr. Wingate after the settlement of Robbins' original claim showed that Robbins suffered from disc degeneration at L1-2 and L2-3 with loss of disc height and signal.Â  Thus, the evidence both before and after the settlement of his claim showed the same condition.Â  Neither Dr. Chokshi nor Dr. Wingate opined that Robbins' condition had worsened; they only noted that his pain was continuing.Â  Robbins testified at the hearing before the single commissioner that his pain never abated after his injury, he just failed to inform Walgreens prior to the settlement for fear of being terminated.Â  It is irrelevant that Dr. Chokshi took Robbins out of work in April 2004 because the only evidence in the record regarding the state of Robbins' condition was that it was similar both before and after the settlement.Â  Further, although the single commissioner's order stated that Robbins failed to prove he sustained a &quot;significant change&quot; in his condition, the commissioner used the correct standard in reviewing the evidence and found it did not support a finding that he suffered a &quot;physical change of condition for the worse.&quot;Â  Accordingly, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that Robbins failed to prove a change or worsening of his condition.Â \r\n \r\nII. Additional medical treatment\r\nRobbins argues the circuit court erred in affirming the denial of his request for additional medical treatment because it would have lessened his period of disability.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that Robbins failed to preserve this matter for appeal.Â  Although he requested &quot;additional medical examination and treatment&quot; due to a change of condition in his post-settlement Form 50, Robbins did not argue before the single commissioner that he was entitled to continuing medical treatment after the date he reached MMI in order to lessen his period of disability.Â  The single commissioner only ruled on Robbins' change of condition claim and did not specifically rule on the alternate claim that Robbins was entitled to continuing medical treatment in order to lessen his period of disability.Â  Although Robbins raised the issue of his entitlement to continuing medical treatment in order to lessen his period of disability in his appeal to the Appellate Panel, Robbins only argued he was entitled to compensation for a change in condition.Â  Because the matter was not argued before the single commissioner or the Appellate Panel, Robbins waived the matter.Â  It is not appropriate for this court to review the issue for the first time on appeal.Â  City of Columbia v. Ervin, 330 S.C. 516, 519-20, 500 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1998) (holding than an issue not argued to an intermediate appellate court is not preserved for review in the supreme court or the court of appeals). \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere was substantial evidence in the record to support the single commissioner's and the Appellate Court's findings that Robbins failed to prove a change in condition.Â  Further, because Robbins failed to argue that he was entitled to continuing medical treatment after MMI in order to lessen his period of disability, this issue is not preserved.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court's order affirming the Appellate Panel is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
