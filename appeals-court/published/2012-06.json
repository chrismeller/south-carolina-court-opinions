The\r\nquestion before the court is \"constructive notice of what?\" More precisely stated,\r\nthe issue we address is: What is the \"defect or condition\" of which a plaintiff must\r\nprove a governmental entity had constructive notice before the entity is subject to\r\nliability \"for loss arising out of a defect or a condition in [or] on . . . a highway,\r\nroad, street, . . . or other public way caused by a third party\"? § 15-78-60(15).\r\nAlberta Major presented evidence the City of Hartsville had notice of\r\ncircumstances it knew would eventually lead to a dangerous defect or condition,\r\n\nbut she presented no evidence the City had any notice of the defect or condition\r\nshe alleged proximately caused her injury. We affirm the circuit court's decision to\r\ngrant summary judgment to the City.\r\n\r\n    I.       Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nMajor attended night classes at Coker College in Hartsville, South Carolina. On\r\nthe afternoon of her injury, December 1, 2008, Major parked in a lot across the\r\nstreet from the Student Union Building, where she was going to check her mailbox\r\nbefore class. To reach the building, Major walked on a sidewalk that turned into a\r\ngrassy area before she crossed the street at a corner. The City owns the sidewalk\r\nand grassy area. As Major walked over the grassy area to get to the street, her foot\r\n\"slipped into a hole.\" She did not fall but \"stumbled\" and \"hobbled on across the\r\nstreet.\" Five days later, Major went to the emergency room for ankle pain. She\r\nlater saw an orthopedist and attended physical therapy for her ankle.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, Major filed this action for damages against the City. The City filed a\r\nmotion for summary judgment asserting it was not liable under the Tort Claims Act\r\nbecause it was not on notice of any hole. The circuit court conducted a hearing,\r\nagreed with the City's position, and granted the motion.\r\n\r\n   II.       Summary Judgment Standard\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\nfact and [] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP. \"In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the\r\nevidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Robinson v. Estate of\r\nHarris, 388 S.C. 630, 638, 698 S.E.2d 222, 226 (2010) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). \"On appeal from the grant of a summary judgment motion, [we apply]\r\nthe same standard as that required for the circuit court.\" 388 S.C. at 637, 698\r\nS.E.2d at 226.\r\n\r\n  III.       \"Defect or Condition\" Under the Tort Claims Act\r\n\r\nMajor argues the City is liable for her injuries under subsection 15-78-60(15) of\r\nthe Tort Claims Act, which provides in part:\r\n\r\n             Governmental entities responsible for maintaining\r\n             highways, roads, streets, causeways, bridges, or other\r\n\n             public ways are not liable for loss arising out of a defect\r\n             or a condition in, on, under, or overhanging a highway,\r\n             road, street, causeway, bridge, or other public way\r\n             caused by a third party unless the defect or condition is\r\n             not corrected by the particular governmental entity\r\n             responsible for the maintenance within a reasonable time\r\n             after actual or constructive notice.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60(15) (2005). The parties agree there is no evidence of\r\nactual notice. Major argues the City was on constructive notice of \"the condition at\r\nissue,\" which she defines as \"the unpaved corner of the intersection that was\r\nfrequently subject to vehicles driving over it creating ruts.\" Her argument is based\r\nprimarily on the testimony of the City Director of Parks and Leisure Services,\r\nPhillip Gardner. Gardner testified that \"for years\" he observed trucks cutting the\r\ncorner where Major fell and that the truck tires crossing unpaved ground caused\r\n\"depressions.\" Gardner stated when his crew noticed a depression, \"they've gone\r\nback and they have put sand or clay back in the area.\" However, he called it \"a\r\nfruitless effort because a few days later, it's . . . right back in the same condition.\"\r\nHe testified that because of this, \"they just kept an eye on that area to make sure\r\nthat it did not create . . . some sort of a . . . problem at a later time.\"\r\n\r\nMajor also presented the testimony of Hartsville police officer Michael Sanchez,1\r\nwho responded to the scene of Major's fall when she reported it to the City three\r\ndays later. Officer Sanchez testified he observed \"a little bit of a concave\r\ndepression in the dirt\" at the corner. When Major's counsel asked him what\r\n\"thoughts\" he had on \"how the depression was created,\" Sanchez testified it could\r\nhave been caused by \"vehicles cross[ing] over sidewalks and corners.\" Sanchez\r\nexplained he had seen vehicles do that at the intersection where Major fell, and \"we\r\nfind this happening throughout the City a lot where people cut corners and it could\r\nhave been something generated from just constant wear and tear. I know I've\r\nobserved many a vehicle travel through a corner like that and go over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe circuit court found that the allegation the City was on notice of an \"unpaved\r\ncorner of the intersection that was frequently subject to vehicles driving over it\r\ncreating ruts\" does not create a \"genuine issue as to any material fact\" under\r\nsubsection 15-78-60(15). The court stated:\r\n\r\n1 Gardner and Sanchez are the only City employees whose testimony is in the\r\nrecord. We have not considered the testimony of any other witnesses because their\r\nknowledge cannot be imputed to the City.\r\n\n             [T]he alleged defect in this case involved nothing more\r\n             than the periodic placement and correction of tire tracks\r\n             on grass at a City of Hartsville street corner. The Court\r\n             disagrees with the Plaintiff's assertion that the\r\n             Defendant's knowledge of the periodic cutting of street\r\n             corners was a continuous condition and finds that this did\r\n             not place the Defendant on constructive notice of the\r\n             actual defect, rut or depression in which the Plaintiff\r\n             injured herself.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit court. To prove liability under subsection 15-78-60(15),\r\na plaintiff must prove the governmental entity was on notice of that which she\r\nalleges was the proximate cause of her injury. Here, Major alleges the proximate\r\ncause was the depression, rut, or hole. However, viewing the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to Major, she has shown only that the City was aware of the\r\ncircumstances which were likely, even certain, to cause a hole. As we will discuss\r\nlater, this argument misses the significance of what a plaintiff alleges was the\r\nproximate cause of her injury.\r\n\r\nMajor argues the repetitive nature of trucks driving off the roadway at the corner\r\nand causing depressions, ruts, or holes establishes a continual condition, and\r\ntherefore the City was on constructive notice that the specific condition or defect\r\nthat caused Major's fall would likely develop. In support of her argument, Major\r\ncites Fickling v. City of Charleston, 372 S.C. 597, 643 S.E.2d 110 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nFickling is factually similar to Major's case because it involved a plaintiff who\r\n\"stepped into a hole in a sidewalk and fell, sustaining injuries.\" 372 S.C. at 599,\r\n643 S.E.2d at 112. However, Fickling does not support Major's argument because\r\nin that case we found evidence that the City of Charleston was on constructive\r\nnotice of the specific \"defect or condition\" the plaintiff alleged caused her\r\ninjuries—\"a hole in a sidewalk.\" We stated: \"In the light most favorable to\r\nFickling, there was at least some evidence that (1) there were numerous City\r\npersonnel within the area of the defect who could have seen and reported the\r\nproblem; [and] (2) the condition had existed for a while.\" 372 S.C. at 609-10, 643\r\nS.E.2d at 117. Specifically, we cited evidence \"the hole was partially covered by\r\nleaves,\" 372 S.C. at 601, 643 S.E.2d at 113, a photograph showing \"[l]arge cracks\r\nradiated out from [the hole],\" id., and the testimony of Charleston's Public Service\r\nDirector that the hole \"had probably been that way for a while.\" 372 S.C. at 610\r\nn.34, 643 S.E.2d at 117 n.34. Fickling, therefore, was decided on the basis of the\r\nexistence of evidence that the \"condition or defect\" that caused the plaintiff's\r\n\ninjury—the hole in the sidewalk—had existed long enough that City of Charleston\r\npersonnel should have seen it and fixed it.\r\n\r\nIn this case, on the other hand, Major offered no evidence the City was on notice of\r\nthe particular depression, rut, or hole she alleges caused her injury. Gardner\r\ntestified his crew typically inspected a particular intersection every three to five\r\nweeks. Gardner did not know if any of his staff was present at the corner in the\r\nweek before Major fell. He testified the City's records indicated that because\r\nMajor fell on the Monday after Thanksgiving, \"the last time we would have or\r\ncould have been there would be Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\" Major's\r\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that \"we don't know\" how long \"the particular\r\ndepression that caused Mrs. Major's injuries\" had been there, and that it could have\r\nbeen created that morning. Because there was no evidentiary basis on which the\r\njury could determine how long a depression, rut, or hole had been there, a jury\r\nwould have to speculate whether City personnel should have seen it. In this\r\nsituation, there was no evidence of constructive notice and summary judgment was\r\nrequired. See Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997)\r\n(stating \"verdicts may not be permitted to rest upon surmise, conjecture or\r\nspeculation\").\r\n\r\nMajor's argument that Fickling is applicable to this case appears to be based on a\r\nreference this court made at the end of a footnote to the supreme court's discussion\r\nof two cases in Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 542 S.E.2d 728\r\n(2001). See Fickling, 372 S.C. at 610 n.37, 643 S.E.2d at 117 n.37. In\r\nWintersteen, refuting an argument that our courts \"have . . . required storekeepers\r\nto take actions to prevent or minimize the foreseeable risk of a foreign substance\r\non the floor of its premises,\" the supreme court explained its holding in Henderson\r\nv. St. Francis Community Hospital, 303 S.C. 177, 399 S.E.2d 767 (1990) and this\r\ncourt's holding in Pinckney v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 311 S.C. 1, 426 S.E.2d 327\r\n(Ct. App. 1992). 344 S.C. at 36, 36 n.1, 542 S.E.2d at 730, 730 n.1. The court\r\nexplained that \"recurrence alone is insufficient to establish constructive notice.\"\r\n344 S.C. at 37 n.1, 542 S.E.2d at 730 n.1. The court went on to explain that\r\n\r\n             there may be certain factual patterns, as in Henderson\r\n             and Pinckney, wherein the recurrence is of such a nature\r\n             as to amount to a continual condition, and that factor,\r\n             when coupled with other evidence, such as store\r\n             employees' knowledge thereof, may be sufficient to\r\n             create a jury issue as to the defendant's constructive\r\n             notice at the time of the accident.\r\n\nId.\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, this case does not fit the \"factual patterns\" of Henderson and\r\nPinckney. First, those cases did not arise as exceptions to sovereign immunity\r\nunder the Tort Claims Act. Second, in both of those cases the defendant's\r\nnegligence created the circumstance which led to the recurrence of a dangerous\r\ncondition that \"amount[ed] to a continual condition.\" In Henderson, St. Francis\r\nHospital ignored the advice of an architectural firm it hired to design an addition to\r\nits parking lot that it should remove numerous mature sweetgum trees because the\r\nballs they drop on the parking lot \"are dangerous to pedestrians.\" 303 S.C. at 180,\r\n399 S.E.2d at 768-69. Despite this advice, St. Francis \"built a stairway\r\nimmediately adjacent to one of the trees\" and \"failed to use a regular maintenance\r\nprogram.\" 303 S.C. at 180, 399 S.E.2d at 769. In Pinckney, the store manager\r\n\"created a dangerous situation\" by putting a \"poinsettia display . . . on a make-shift\r\nshelf adjacent to the aisles in the store.\" 311 S.C. at 4, 426 S.E.2d at 329. The\r\nplaintiff presented evidence that a poinsettia leaf \"secretes a 'milky substance'\"\r\nwhen it is removed from the plant, and that \"the store manager observed the\r\npoinsettia leaves falling to the floor and . . . left [them] . . . until the next periodic\r\nsweeping.\" Id.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the supreme court stated in Wintersteen, the \"continual condition\" must\r\nbe \"coupled with other evidence.\" 344 S.C. at 36 n.1, 542 S.E.2d at 730 n.1. We\r\ndo not see any \"other evidence\" in this record which could create a jury question\r\non the City's liability under subsection 15-78-60(15) even if this were a \"factual\r\npattern\" like Henderson or Pinckney.\r\n\r\nOur holding is further supported by Wintersteen. In Wintersteen, the plaintiff\r\n\"slipped and fell on a puddle of clear liquid\" while walking near \"a self-service\r\nsoda fountain equipped with an ice dispenser\" in a Food Lion store. 344 S.C. at\r\n34, 542 S.E.2d at 729. Wintersteen admitted Food Lion had neither actual nor\r\nconstructive notice of the liquid on the floor but instead argued \"the storekeeper\r\nhas a duty to minimize such risks and take measures to prevent the items from\r\nfalling\" because it is foreseeable that the ice dispenser will cause liquid to fall to\r\nthe floor. 344 S.C. at 35, 542 S.E.2d at 730. Affirming this court's decision that\r\nthe trial court should have directed a verdict for Food Lion, the supreme court\r\ndistinguished between liability for failure to correct an existing dangerous\r\ncondition and liability for failure to prevent the dangerous condition from arising\r\nin the first place.\r\n\n             Wintersteen does not dispute the trial court's ruling that\r\n             Food Lion neither placed the substance on the floor nor\r\n             had actual or constructive notice thereof. Rather, she\r\n             contends that, if it is foreseeable an item will fall to the\r\n             floor, then the storekeeper has a duty to minimize such\r\n             risks and take measures to prevent the items from falling.\r\n             Although this approach has some appeal, we decline to\r\n             depart from our traditional \"foreign substance\" analysis.\r\n             We adhere to prior precedent that a storekeeper is liable\r\n             only upon a showing that it actually placed the foreign\r\n             substance on the floor, or that it had actual or\r\n             constructive notice thereof.\r\n\r\n344 S.C. at 35-36, 542 S.E.2d at 730.\r\n\r\nA similar distinction exists for liability of governmental entities under the Tort\r\nClaims Act. When a plaintiff seeks to recover for the failure to correct some\r\nexisting \"defect or condition,\" the plaintiff must prove the governmental entity had\r\nactual or constructive notice of the defect or condition alleged to have proximately\r\ncaused the plaintiff's injury. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60(10) (2005) (requiring\r\nproof of actual or constructive notice for \"loss resulting from . . . natural conditions\r\non unimproved property\"); § 15-78-60(15) (requiring the same for \"loss resulting\r\nfrom . . . a defect or condition . . . caused by a third party); § 15-78-60(16) (2005)\r\n(requiring the same for \"loss resulting from . . . public property, intended or\r\npermitted to be used as a park, playground, or open area for recreational\r\npurposes\").\r\n\r\nHowever, the Tort Claims Act contains different standards for liability when a\r\nplaintiff seeks to recover for the governmental entity's failure to prevent a\r\ndangerous condition from arising. For example, the Act provides immunity from\r\nliability in design defect cases. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60(15)\r\n(\"Governmental entities are not liable for the design of highways and other public\r\nways.\"). Even though absolute design immunity is not available in all cases, the\r\nCity's actions might have been subject to discretionary design immunity. Compare\r\nGiannini v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 378 S.C. 573, 580, 664 S.E.2d 450, 453 (2008)\r\n(holding absolute design immunity was not available when SCDOT was on notice\r\nof the need for median barriers) and Wooten v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 333 S.C. 464,\r\n467-68, 511 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1999) (holding absolute design immunity was not\r\navailable when SCDOT was on notice an intersection was hazardous because\r\nexisting traffic signals did not allow safe pedestrian crossing) with Wooten, 333\r\n\nS.C. at 469, 511 S.E.2d at 358 (holding discretionary immunity was a jury issue on\r\na claim that SCDOT failed to redesign an intersection with traffic signals that\r\nallowed safe pedestrian crossing \"after notice the intersection was hazardous\") and\r\nGiannini, 378 S.C. at 590, 664 S.E.2d at 459 (Pleicones, J., dissenting) (stating\r\n\"[a]lthough an entity may lose design immunity, it may still be immune from\r\nliability if it exercises discretion when faced with actual or constructive knowledge\r\nof a hazardous condition\").\r\n\r\nThe distinction in Wintersteen and the Tort Claims Act turns on the plaintiff's\r\nallegation of proximate cause. In Wintersteen, the plaintiff alleged the proximate\r\ncause of her injury was Food Lion's failure to \"take measures to prevent the items\r\nfrom falling\" to the floor. 344 S.C. at 35, 542 S.E.2d at 730. The supreme court\r\n\"decline[d] to depart from our traditional 'foreign substance' analysis . . . [and]\r\nadhere[d] to prior precedent that a storekeeper is liable only upon a showing . . .\r\nthat it had actual or constructive notice\" of the \"substance on the floor.\" 344 S.C.\r\nat 35-36, 542 S.E.2d at 730. It is not enough, therefore, to prove the storekeeper\r\nknew the substance would eventually be on the floor and failed to take steps to\r\nprevent it. Similarly, when a plaintiff alleges a governmental entity is \"liable for\r\nloss arising out of a defect or a condition . . . caused by a third party\" under\r\nsubsection 15-78-60(15), she must offer evidence that the governmental entity had\r\nnotice of the defect or condition she alleges was the proximate cause of her injury.\r\nMajor's argument that the City was on notice of trucks cutting the corner to create\r\nholes misses the distinction. Just as in Wintersteen, it is not enough to allege the\r\ngovernmental entity knew the defect or condition would eventually develop and\r\nthen cause injury. This would not be an allegation that the City should have fixed\r\nthe hole, but a design defect allegation that the City should have taken steps to fix\r\nthe intersection where trucks cause holes. However, her complaint contains no\r\nallegation the City failed to take any step to prevent a depression, rut, or hole from\r\ndeveloping, and, at oral argument, her counsel conceded she did not raise a design\r\ndefect claim.\r\n\r\nThe dissent argues that we have applied an actual notice standard when only\r\nconstructive notice is required. Our focus, however, is not the difference between\r\nactual and constructive notice. The question we address is \"constructive notice of\r\nwhat?\" The answer is that the plaintiff must prove the governmental entity was on\r\nconstructive notice of the defect or condition she alleges proximately caused her\r\ninjury. Major alleges the proximate cause of her injury was a hole but presented\r\nno evidence the City was on constructive notice of a hole.\r\n\n   IV.       Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe affirm the circuit court's decision to grant summary judgment in the City's\r\nfavor because we find no evidence the City was on constructive notice of the\r\ndefect or condition Major alleges proximately caused her injury.\r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., dissents.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Respectfully, I dissent. Alberta Major brought this tort action against\r\nthe City of Hartsville (City), alleging she was injured when she fell in a \"hole\" on\r\nCity's premises. The trial court granted City summary judgment, finding City was\r\nnot on notice of any defect, rut, or depression at the location of the incident. In my\r\nopinion, the majority, as well as the trial court, has effectively applied an actual\r\nnotice standard to this matter, where the issue is one of constructive notice.\r\nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Major, I believe she has\r\npresented sufficient evidence City had constructive notice of a defect or condition,\r\nalleged to have caused her injury, such that the granting of summary judgment to\r\nCity on the basis that City had no notice was improper.\r\n\r\nThe facts are as follows: On Monday, December 1, 2008, Major, a resident of\r\nFlorence, traveled to Hartsville to attend class at Coker College. Major parked her\r\ncar in a school parking lot, and then proceeded to a sidewalk, walking her usual\r\nroute to class. This particular sidewalk was paved to a point, but as it reached a\r\ncorner where two roads intersected, the sidewalk ran out, leaving a grassy area\r\nbetween the sidewalk and the road. Major, intending to cross the street, stopped\r\nbeside the stop sign on this corner to check for traffic. According to Major, as she\r\n\"took a step out,\" her foot slipped into a hole, her knee buckled to the right, and she\r\nstumbled, but regained her balance. When she returned for class the following\r\nThursday, December 4, Major reported she had injured her foot in the incident to a\r\nCoker College employee at the Student Building. The employee instructed her to\r\nreport the matter to Coker College security. Major located security officer Burke\r\nHoffman and pointed out the place where she indicated she had stepped into a hole.\r\nHoffman informed Major the property did not belong to Coker College, and told\r\nher she needed to contact City's police department. Major then called the police,\r\nand Officer Michael Sanchez responded to the incident location. Major informed\r\nOfficer Sanchez she had hurt herself on December 1 when, as she was about to\r\ncross the street, she stepped into a deep hole in the grass at the corner of the\r\nintersection. Major returned to the location the next day to take photographs of the\r\n\narea, and found an individual with a golf cart who was putting dirt in the area.\r\nMajor stated she sought medical treatment at the emergency room on December 6,\r\n2008, and was thereafter seen by an orthopedist and ultimately referred to physical\r\ntherapy for injury to her right ankle.\r\n\r\nThe Coker College security officer described the grassy area incident site Major\r\nshowed to him as being located between the sidewalk and the road and as being\r\n\"like a rut,\" with leaves partially covering it. When asked if he had any idea what\r\nmay have caused the rut or hole, Hoffman responded:\r\n\r\n             I do know from observations from over the years, that\r\n             cars, they come – and not only when I'm in the parking\r\n             lot, but when I'm on campus looking back towards that\r\n             way, that cars come and cut that corner. And cut it, you\r\n             know, a lot of times it - - they just roll, and don't come to\r\n             a complete stop. And then, you know, they go on.\r\n\r\nHoffman indicated the cars \"cut real sharp\" and drive on the grass. Hoffman also\r\nacknowledged he had seen large 18-wheeler trucks cut that corner because it is\r\ndifficult for them to make a right turn there due to a median. The area of the\r\nincident has since been paved, and Hoffman indicated he had seen vehicles cutting\r\nthat corner since then and noted tire tracks could be observed on the cement.\r\nCoker College employee Gokey described the area in question as an \"impression\"\r\nwith grass growing over it, two to three inches on a slope, about two feet long and\r\none foot wide.\r\n\r\nOfficer Sanchez described the corner incident area as being about a foot away from\r\nthe sidewalk and appearing \"to be some kind of a relief, a concave depression . . .\r\nin the dirt with grass growing in it and very sparse leaf coverage.\" He testified the\r\ndepression was oval shaped, about eight to twelve inches long, six inches wide,\r\nand an inch to an inch and a half in depth. When asked if he had any thoughts on\r\nhow the hole or depression was created, Officer Sanchez indicated it could have\r\nbeen caused by \"constant wear and tear\" from traffic, as he has observed vehicles\r\ncutting that corner as they turned, driving up on the grass.\r\n\r\nPhillip Gardner, the Director of Parks and Leisure Services for City testified that\r\nPublic Works was in charge of the sidewalk, but his department was in charge of\r\nthe grassy strip between the sidewalk and road. Gardner was not informed of the\r\nincident until around the time Major filed her lawsuit in July, 2009. His\r\ndepartment then went out to look at the area, and found that trucks and cars\r\n\nappeared to be cutting the corner short, leaving tire marks. Gardner stated right\r\nrear wheels were going across the curb to try to make the turn because it is a tight\r\nturn. Sometime after his department observed the area, the Public Works\r\nDepartment continued the sidewalk down to the street, paving the corner of land.\r\nGardner acknowledged they had \"observed vehicles making that turn for years,\"\r\nthat trucks in particular had difficulty with it and would often drive up on the grass,\r\nand it had caused depressions before. When asked how his department had\r\naddressed the issue in the past, Gardner stated:\r\n\r\n             They've gone back and they have put sand or clay back in\r\n             the area, but it was - - it was a fruitless effort because a\r\n             few days later, it's, you know, right back in the same\r\n             condition so after two or three attempts, they just keep an\r\n             eye on that area to make sure that it did not create, you\r\n             know, some sort of a, you know problem at a later time.\r\n\r\nGardner further noted that tire tracks were currently on the paved portion, and if\r\ntrucks continued to drive over the area, the concrete would eventually crumble.\r\nAccording to Gardner, his department worked in this area once every three to five\r\nweeks, and if his \"crew had noticed that a tractor-trailer had cut that corner and left\r\na deep grove or rut there,\" they would have then \"gone in and back-filled it and\r\ntamped it tight and observed the area to make sure that it was packed well and did\r\nnot wash out or settle.\"\r\n\r\nCity moved for summary judgment, asserting there was no evidence it had actual\r\nor constructive notice of any rut, hole, or defect in the property, arguing there was\r\nno evidence anyone with City was on notice of any problem at the location in the\r\ndays, weeks and months prior to the incident. The trial court granted City's\r\nmotion, finding City was not on notice, constructive or otherwise, of any defect, rut\r\nor depression at the location of the alleged incident. In making its ruling, the court\r\nnoted that deposition testimony showed neither City nor Coker College were aware\r\nof any prior falls or injuries at the location; Major herself was unable to cite any\r\nprior experience or observation of any defect, rut, or depression in the area despite\r\nher frequent use of that street corner; there was no testimony from anyone that\r\nshowed any notice, constructive or otherwise, of any specific rut or depression at\r\nthe location in the days, weeks, or months prior to Major's accident; and, based on\r\nthe deposition testimony of Gardner, City had corrected depressions in the past by\r\nfilling and tamping the area affected such that City actively maintained its streets\r\nand street corners. The court specifically disagreed with Major's assertion that\r\nCity's knowledge of the periodic cutting of street corners was a continuous\r\n\ncondition, and found such did not place City on constructive notice of the alleged\r\ndefect, rut, or depression.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Appellate courts\r\napply the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP,\r\nwhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment. Turner v. Milliman, 392 S.C. 116,\r\n121-22, 708 S.E.2d 766, 769 (2011). In determining whether any triable issues of\r\nfact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 122, 708 S.E.2d at 769.\r\nWhen the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence, a non-moving\r\nparty need only present a scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary\r\njudgment. Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801,\r\n803 (2009). \"Summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no\r\ndispute as to evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom those facts.\" Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 378, 534 S.E.2d\r\n688, 692 (2000). Additionally, because summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it\r\nshould be cautiously invoked to ensure a litigant is not improperly deprived of a\r\ntrial on disputed factual issues. Madison v. Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123,\r\n134, 638 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2006).\r\n\r\nMajor contends the only issue on appeal is whether City had adequate notice of the\r\ncondition that caused her injuries. She concedes City did not have actual notice of\r\nthe depression at the time of the incident. However, she notes that both parties\r\nacknowledge a constructive notice standard applies in this situation, and asserts the\r\ntrial court erred in holding City did not have constructive notice of the condition\r\nthat caused her injuries. Major points to the deposition testimony showing,\r\nwhether the area was described as a depression, rut, or impression, City had\r\nknowledge that the condition was likely created by vehicles driving over the grass\r\nat that corner. Major further notes that the deposition testimony of Gardner shows\r\nhis department had an established procedure for dealing with ruts and depressions\r\ncaused by vehicles driving on the grass while turning at that particular corner. She\r\nargues the deposition testimony, showing City's common knowledge of the\r\npractice of vehicles cutting the corner as well as the creation of the ruts or\r\ndepressions, created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether City had\r\nconstructive notice of the depression. Major thus maintains that at least a scintilla\r\nof evidence exists to support the position that City had constructive notice.\r\n\nMajor further argues the trial court largely based its ruling on a determination that\r\nCity was not aware of the depression that caused her injuries, and despite several\r\nreferences to constructive notice, in fact applied an actual notice standard. She\r\nnotes that the trial court's reliance on her own lack of knowledge of the depression\r\nat the location is misplaced, because the burden is on City, not her, to keep the\r\npremises in a reasonably safe condition, and the issue is whether City had\r\nconstructive notice, not whether she did. Major takes issue with the trial court's\r\nfinding that City showed through the testimony of Sanchez, Hoffman, and Gardner\r\nthat neither City, nor Coker College security, were aware of any rut, depression or\r\ndefect at the location. She argues (1) constructive knowledge does not require\r\nactual knowledge and (2) deposition testimony showed these individuals were\r\naware that depressions had been created at this corner in the past, and City's\r\nknowledge of this recurrent condition, as evidenced by Garner's testimony that his\r\ndepartment had to keep an eye on the area to make sure it did not create some sort\r\nof problem \"at a later time,\" constituted constructive notice of the condition at this\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nBecause I believe the evidence shows there is a genuine issue of material fact on\r\nwhether City had constructive notice, I would reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act (SCTCA) provides that \"the State, an agency,\r\na political subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in the\r\nsame manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like\r\ncircumstances, subject to the limitations upon liability and damages, and\r\nexemptions from liability and damages, contained herein.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-\r\n78-40 (2005). Our legislature has, however, provided certain exceptions to a\r\ngovernmental entity's waiver of immunity. S.C. Code Ann. 15-78-60 (2005 &\r\nSupp. 2011).\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that section 15-78-60(15) of the SCTCA applies to the matter at\r\nhand. This section provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\r\n             Governmental entities responsible for maintaining\r\n             highways, roads, streets, causeways, bridges, or other\r\n             public ways are not liable for loss arising out of a defect\r\n             or a condition in, on, under, or overhanging a highway,\r\n             road, street, causeway, bridge, or other public way\r\n             caused by a third party unless the defect or condition is\r\n             not corrected by the particular governmental entity\r\n\n             responsible for the maintenance within a reasonable time\r\n             after actual or constructive notice.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-60(15) (2005) (emphasis added). Thus, City may be\r\nliable for Major's injuries only if it had \"actual or constructive notice\" of \"a defect\r\nor a condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Constructive notice and actual notice are not one and the same.\" Anderson v.\r\nBuonforte, 365 S.C. 482, 492, 617 S.E.2d 750, 755 (Ct. App. 2005). In the context\r\nof the SCTCA, \"actual notice means all the facts are disclosed and there is nothing\r\nleft to investigate.\" Strother v. Lexington Cnty. Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54,\r\n65, 504 S.E.2d 117, 123 (1998). \"Actual notice may be shown by direct evidence\r\nor inferred from factual circumstances.\" Id. \"Notice is regarded as actual where\r\nthe person sought to be charged therewith either knows of the existence of the\r\nparticular facts in question or is conscious of having the means of knowing it, even\r\nthough such means may not be employed by him. Id. at 63 n.6, 504 S.E.2d at 122\r\nn.6. \"Generally, actual notice is synonymous with knowledge.\" Id. On the other\r\nhand, in regard to constructive notice, our courts have stated as follows:\r\n\r\n             Constructive notice is a legal inference which substitutes\r\n             for actual notice. It is notice imputed to a person whose\r\n             knowledge of facts is sufficient to put him on inquiry; if\r\n             these facts were pursued with due diligence, they would\r\n             lead to other undisclosed facts. Therefore, this person is\r\n             presumed to have actual knowledge of the undisclosed\r\n             facts.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nHere, I agree with Major that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nCity. While Major concedes City did not have actual notice of the condition of the\r\ncorner at the time of her accident, viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences\r\ntherefrom in a light most favorable to Major, there is a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to whether City had constructive notice of the condition that caused Major's\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence here that (1) a condition, in the form of a depression, rut or some\r\nother defect, existed on the corner where Major sustained her injury, (2) that\r\nnumerous individuals, who worked for City and the local college, frequently\r\nobserved vehicles being unable to properly navigate a turn at this specific\r\n\nintersection, resulting in the vehicles cutting over the grassy area of this corner,\r\nand (3) both City employee Gardner, the Director of Parks and Leisure Services for\r\nCity, and Officer Sanchez attributed the depression to the wear and tear from the\r\nvehicles cutting across the area. Additionally, I find of particular note the\r\ntestimony of Gardner, wherein he stated his department addressed the issue in the\r\npast by putting sand or clay back in the area, but such effort seemed fruitless, as\r\nthe area would be in the same condition a few days later, and after two or three\r\nattempts to remedy the matter, their solution was to keep an eye on that area to\r\nmake sure that it did not create some sort of problem at a later time. I believe this\r\ntestimony provides some evidence City was aware the vehicles were cutting across\r\nthis particular corner causing the condition, that City attempted in the past to\r\ncorrect the condition, that their attempts appeared futile, and, consequently, there\r\nwas a need to observe the area thereafter. Accordingly, given the evidence\r\npresented, I believe there is a genuine issue as to whether City had knowledge of\r\nfacts sufficient to put it on inquiry, such that constructive notice was imputed to\r\nCity. Strother, 332 S.C. at 63 n.6, 504 S.E.2d at 122 n.6.\r\n\r\nI find further support for this conclusion based on our courts' consideration, in the\r\ncases of Fickling v. City of Charleston, 372 S.C. 597, 643 S.E.2d 110 (Ct. App.\r\n2007) and Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 542 S.E.2d 728 (2001), that\r\nconstructive notice may be found where there is a recurring problem. In Fickling,\r\nthe plaintiff filed a negligence action alleging she suffered injuries after she\r\nstepped into a hole in a city sidewalk. Id. at 600, 643 S.E.2d at 112. There, this\r\ncourt found conflicting evidence was presented as to whether the City of\r\nCharleston had constructive notice of the defect in the sidewalk, observing that in\r\nviewing it in a light most favorable to Fickling, there was at least some evidence\r\nthat (1) there were numerous City of Charleston personnel within the area of the\r\ndefect who could have seen and reported the problem; (2) the condition had existed\r\nfor a while; and (3) the City of Charleston had an established policy in place to\r\ndeal with defects in the sidewalks, and problems with the sidewalks were an\r\nexpected and \"recurrent\" or \"continual\" condition of which it had notice. Id. at\r\n610, 643 S.E.2d at 116-17. Additionally, this court noted in Fickling that our\r\nsupreme court observed in Wintersteen that two prior slip-and-fall cases involved\r\nconditions of such a recurrent nature that the defendants were chargeable with\r\nconstructive notice on the day of the accident, \"because they established certain\r\npatterns 'wherein the recurrence is of such a nature as to amount to a continual\r\ncondition' and this, coupled with other factors, 'may be sufficient to create a jury\r\nissue' as to constructive notice.\" Fickling, 372 S.C. at 610 n.37, 643 S.E.2d at 117\r\nn.37. In Wintersteen, our supreme court stated as follows:\r\n\n             Although mere recurrence alone is insufficient to\r\n             establish constructive notice, there may be certain factual\r\n             patterns . . . wherein the recurrence is of such a nature as\r\n             to amount to a continual condition, and that factor, when\r\n             coupled with other evidence, such as store employees'\r\n             knowledge thereof, may be sufficient to create a jury\r\n             issue as to the defendant's constructive notice at the time\r\n             of the accident.\r\n\r\nId. at 36 n.1, 542 S.E.2d at 730 n.1.\r\n\r\nThus, while mere recurrence alone is insufficient to establish constructive notice,\r\nour courts have intimated that where the recurrence is of such a nature as to\r\namount to a continual condition, that continual condition, when coupled with other\r\nevidence such as an employee's knowledge of the recurring nature of the problem,\r\nmay be sufficient to create a jury issue as to constructive notice at the time of the\r\naccident. Here, there was evidence presented that City had knowledge of the\r\nrecurring problem of vehicles cutting across the corner of the land in question\r\nthereby creating a depression in the area, and that it was a recurring problem that\r\ncontinued even after City's attempts to ameliorate it.\r\n\r\nBy finding \"Major offered no evidence the City was on notice of the particular\r\ndepression, rut, or hole she alleges caused her injury,\" the majority is essentially\r\nemploying an actual notice standard rather than one of constructive notice. In spite\r\nof the fact that City may not have been on notice in the days, weeks or months\r\nprior to Major's accident that a \"particular\" defect existed on the corner, such\r\nwould amount only to actual notice, and I believe the evidence presented shows a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether City was on constructive notice of a\r\ndefect at that location. Accordingly, I would hold the trial court erred in granting\r\nCity's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4980","title":"Hammer v.

Appellant contends: (1) Respondent\r\nfailed to file a proper motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 7(b), SCRCP; (2) the\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\ncontract clearly demonstrated the parties' intent that the family court not have\r\nexclusive jurisdiction over the contract; and (3) sections 20-3-690 and 63-3-530 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code do not provide for exclusive family court jurisdiction in\r\nthe present case. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAppellant and Respondent were married on August 4, 1998 and had two children.\r\nOn September 2, 2005, Respondent filed a complaint seeking an order of separate\r\nmaintenance and support, custody, equitable distribution of property, and other\r\nrelief. Subsequently, on December 6, 2007, Respondent filed a second amended\r\ncomplaint seeking a divorce and other relief. The family court litigation was\r\nsettled in two phases. First, the divorce and property settlements were agreed to\r\nand incorporated into the family court's May 12, 2008 order. The May 2008 order\r\nadopted a settlement agreement (May 2008 contract) which included terms\r\ninvolving the parties' former marital home and Appellant's retirement accounts.\r\nThe May 2008 contract included a final clause stating, \"[t]his agreement is a\r\nbinding contract and is enforceable as such under law.\" In its May 2008 order, the\r\nfamily court stated it retained \"jurisdiction to issue any orders necessary to\r\neffectuate the terms of the [May 2008 contract].\" Second, in June 2009, the parties\r\nsettled issues relating to child custody and visitation. On August 19, 2009, the\r\nfamily court entered an order approving the settlement agreement and ending the\r\naction. The family court also expressly re-affirmed the May 2008 order.\r\n\r\nAppellant challenged the May 2008 contract, the 2009 settlement agreement, and\r\nthe family court orders on four occasions. First, on May 4, 2009, Appellant sought\r\nto amend, modify, void, and set aside the May 2008 order and requested a new trial\r\npursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP. The family court dismissed Appellant's motion\r\nwith prejudice. Second, Appellant filed a motion to withdraw, rescind, and\r\nrepudiate his consent to the June 2009 settlement agreement. The motion was\r\ndenied by the family court on January 27, 2010. Third, on September 4, 2009,\r\nAppellant filed a motion to reconsider, amend, alter, modify, and/or for a new trial\r\nand stay of the following family court orders: (1) order for transfer of individual\r\nretirement account; (2) order sealing record; (3) order approving settlement\r\nagreement; and (4) order (ending action). The family court denied Appellant's\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2009, Appellant filed an amended complaint in the circuit court\r\nseeking a declaratory judgment and other relief in connection with the May 2008\r\ncontract. Appellant asserted the May 2008 contract was void ab initio as violating\r\n\r\n \r\n\npublic policy because a key term of the contract was a payment of funds by\r\nAppellant to Respondent in exchange for her agreement to drop certain criminal\r\ncharges against Appellant. Appellant also asserted causes of action for breach of\r\ncontract, breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent intent, conversion, and\r\nbreach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\r\n\r\nIn her first amended answer, motion to dismiss, and counterclaims, Respondent\r\nasserted three defenses: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) failure to state\r\nfacts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and (3) res judicata. Respondent's\r\ncounterclaims included slander of title, tortious interference with an existing\r\ncontractual relationship, intentional infliction of emotional distress, abuse of\r\nprocess, invasion of privacy, wrongful intrusion as to contracts to sell and\r\npurchase, and malicious prosecution. A hearing was held before the circuit court\r\non March 2, 2010. In an April 14, 2010 order, the circuit court dismissed\r\nAppellant's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The circuit court held\r\nits decision did not end the action as to Respondent's counterclaims. Subsequently,\r\nthe circuit court denied Appellant's motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal from the grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP. \"The question of subject matter\r\njurisdiction is a question of law for the court.\" Capital City Ins. Co. v. BP Staff,\r\nInc., 382 S.C. 92, 99, 674 S.E.2d 524, 528 (Ct. App. 2009). \"We are free to decide\r\nquestions of law with no deference to the [circuit] court.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMotion to Dismiss\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in granting Respondent's motion to dismiss\r\nbecause Respondent failed to file a proper motion pursuant to Rule 7(b), SCRCP.1\r\nAppellant also contends the circuit court erred in relying on the sealed family court\r\nrecord. We disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1Appellant incorrectly refers to Rule 7(b), SCRCP as Rule 7(e), SCRCP in his\r\nbrief.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             An application to the court for an order shall be by\r\n             motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial in\r\n             open court with a court reporter present, shall be made in\r\n             writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor,\r\n             and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The\r\n             requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated\r\n             in a written notice of the hearing of the motion.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues Respondent failed to make a separate and distinct motion to\r\ndismiss and \"merely entered a denial of Appellant's allegation that the circuit court\r\nhad subject matter jurisdiction.\" Appellant further contends the findings of the\r\ncircuit court were based solely on statements of Respondent's counsel and on\r\nRespondent's memorandum of law, which referenced the sealed family court\r\nrecord. Appellant maintains portions of the sealed record contained in\r\nRespondent's memorandum were improperly included in the circuit court's findings\r\nof fact.\r\n\r\nRespondent argues subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time.\r\nRespondent contends Appellant was on notice that lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction was asserted in the answer and had adequate notice of the March 2010\r\ncircuit court hearing. Respondent also argues the sealing order expressly provided\r\nthe parties could access and use the sealed record in the domestic litigation.\r\nRespondent maintains Appellant \"opened the door\" to the sealed record by\r\n\"attacking the family court order with his declaratory judgment action,\" and the\r\ncircuit court properly determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Respondent. Subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time\r\nand by any means. Rule 12(h)(3), SCRCP provides, \"[w]henever it appears by\r\nsuggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject\r\nmatter, the court shall dismiss the case.\" Here, Respondent specifically asserted in\r\nher answer, motion to dismiss and counterclaims that the circuit court lacked\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction and asked the court to dismiss Appellant's complaint.\r\nThis pleading gave Appellant notice that Respondent was moving to dismiss his\r\ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, Respondent served\r\nand filed a memorandum in support of her motion to dismiss on February 24, 2010\r\nand Appellant had notice of the March 2, 2010 circuit court hearing to hear the\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the sealing order expressly provides that the parties and the court\r\nmay access and use the sealed file in the \"litigation between [Appellant and\r\n\r\n \r\n\nRespondent].\" Here, the parties to the litigation are the same and the subject\r\nmatter of the case, the May 2008 contract, was executed in partial settlement of the\r\nfamily court litigation and made an order of the family court. Because Appellant's\r\ncomplaint was a continuation of the marital dispute, the circuit court properly\r\nreferenced the family court record. Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not\r\nerr in dismissing Appellant's complaint.\r\n\r\nIntent of the Parties\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in dismissing his complaint because the\r\nMay 2008 contract clearly set forth the parties' intent that the family court did not\r\nhave exclusive jurisdiction over the contract. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983), our supreme\r\ncourt held that once a settlement agreement is approved by the family court, it may\r\nbe enforced by the court's contempt powers unless the settlement agreement\r\nexpressly denies the court continuing jurisdiction. Here, the May 2008 contract\r\nand the May 2008 order expressly vest the family court with jurisdiction to enforce\r\nthe contract. The family court's May 2008 order plainly states, \"[t]his Court retains\r\njurisdiction to issue any orders necessary to effectuate the terms of the [May 2008\r\ncontract].\" Moreover, the May 2008 contract provides that \"[w]hen this settlement\r\nis approved it shall be enforceable through the contempt powers of the [f]amily\r\n[c]ourt.\" Accordingly, we find the May 2008 contract does not evidence intent by\r\nthe parties that the family court not have jurisdiction over the contract.\r\nFurthermore, under Moseley, the family court has continuing subject matter\r\njurisdiction over the claims raised in Appellant's amended complaint.\r\n\r\n§ 20-3-690 and § 63-3-530\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in finding the family court had exclusive\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to sections 20-3-690 and 63-3-530 of the South\r\nCarolina Code. We disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 20-3-690 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011), \"[t]he\r\nfamily courts of this State have subject matter jurisdiction over all contracts\r\nrelating to property which is involved in a proceeding under this article and over\r\nthe construction and enforcement of those contracts.\" Section 63-3-530 provides\r\n\r\n             (A) The family court has exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n             ...\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             (2) to hear and determine actions for divorce a vinculo\r\n             matrimonii, separate support and maintenance, legal\r\n             separation, and in other marital litigation between the\r\n             parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights\r\n             of the parties in the actions in and to the real and personal\r\n             property of the marriage and attorney's fees, if requested\r\n             by either party in the pleadings;\r\n             ...\r\n             (25) to modify or vacate any order issued by the court;\r\n             ...\r\n             (30) to make any order necessary to carry out and enforce\r\n             the provisions of this title, and to hear and determine any\r\n             questions of support, custody, separation, or any other\r\n             matter over which the court has jurisdiction, without the\r\n             intervention of a jury; however, the court may not issue\r\n             an order which prohibits a custodial parent from moving\r\n             his residence to a location within the State unless the\r\n             court finds a compelling reason or unless the parties have\r\n             agreed to such a prohibition;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-530(A)(2)(25)(30) (2010).\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court has the authority to hear the present case\r\npursuant to sections 15-53-20, 15-53-30, and 15-53-90 of the Declaratory\r\nJudgment Act. Section 15-53-20 provides \"[c]ourts of record within their\r\nrespective jurisdictions shall have power to declare rights, status and other legal\r\nrelations . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-53-20 (2005). Section 15-53-30 provides\r\n\r\n             Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract\r\n             or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights,\r\n             status or other legal relations are affected by a statute,\r\n             municipal ordinance, contract or franchise may have\r\n             determined any question of construction or validity\r\n             arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract\r\n             or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status or\r\n             other legal relations thereunder.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-53-30 (2005). Pursuant to section 15-53-90,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n            When a proceeding under this chapter involves the\r\n            determination of an issue of fact such issue may be tried\r\n            and determined in the same manner as issues of fact are\r\n            tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in\r\n            which the proceeding is pending. All existing rights to\r\n            jury trials are hereby preserved.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-53-90 (2005). Appellant contends, in light of the sealed\r\nfamily court record, there is no admissible evidence in the record from which the\r\ncircuit court could determine any fact other than Appellant's allegations and\r\nRespondent's admission that a contract was entered into between the parties.\r\nAppellant argues, applying sections 15-53-20, 15-53-30, and 15-53-90, it is clear\r\nthe circuit court had the power to declare the rights and status of the May 2008\r\ncontract, and had the power to hear and determine the question of the validity of\r\nthe contract.\r\n\r\nRespondent argues the circuit court properly relied on sections 20-3-690 and 63-3-\r\n530 in dismissing Appellant's complaint. Respondent contends South Carolina law\r\nexpressly grants the family court subject matter jurisdiction over the construction\r\nand enforcement of the May 2008 contract and over all of the marital litigation\r\nbetween the parties.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Respondent. The May 2008 contract was part of the parties' divorce\r\nproceeding. Pursuant to section 20-3-690, the family court has exclusive\r\njurisdiction over contracts relating to property in a divorce proceeding. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 20-3-690 (Supp. 2011). Moreover, by merging the May 2008 contract into\r\nthe family court's order, the family court transformed it from a contract between\r\nthe parties into a decree of the court. See Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 214, 603\r\nS.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that merging an agreement into an order\r\ntransforms it from a contract between the parties into a decree of the court). In\r\nEmery, this court held that \"[s]ince Moseley, our courts 'assume that any settlement\r\nin a divorce decree is intended to be judicially decreed unless there is some\r\nexplicit, clear and plain provision in the court approved separation agreement or\r\nthe decree.'\" Id. (quoting Moseley, 279 S.C. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627). \"With the\r\ncourt's approval, the terms become a part of the decree and are binding on the\r\nparties and the court.\" Id. (quoting Moseley at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627). As part of\r\nthe family court order, the agreement \"is fully subject to the family court's\r\nauthority to interpret and enforce its own decrees.\" Id. at 214, 603 S.E.2d at 601-\r\n02 (citing e.g., Terry v. Lee, 308 S.C. 459, 419 S.E.2d 213 (1992) (stating that the\r\nfamily court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties under\r\n\r\n \r\n\nan agreement incorporated into a family court decree)). Accordingly, the circuit\r\ncourt did not err in finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Appellant's\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's dismissal of Appellant's\r\ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4982","title":"Buist v.

In addition,\r\nHusband appeals the family court's decision to grant primary placement of\r\nthe parties' minor child with Katie Buist (Wife). Moreover, Husband\r\nchallenges the family court's determination of the visitation schedule and\r\nchild support payments. Finally, Husband alleges the family court erred in\r\nfailing to make the necessary findings of fact in awarding attorney's fees to\r\nWife. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand in part.\r\n\r\n                    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n      Husband and Wife were married on April 10, 1999, and are the parents\r\nof one minor child, R.B., who was born on September 2, 1999. After marital\r\ndifficulty, the parties separated in December 2007. The same month, Wife\r\nfiled a complaint seeking, among other things, custody of the parties' child,\r\nchild support, equitable division of the marital property, alimony, and\r\nattorney's fees and costs. Husband answered and counterclaimed, seeking\r\ncustody of the parties' child, child support to be held in abeyance, title and\r\npossession of the marital home, and equitable division of the marital\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n       After Husband and Wife amended their pleadings, the parties appeared\r\nbefore the family court on multiple occasions prior to the final hearing in this\r\nmatter. On December 28, 2007, the parties entered into a temporary consent\r\norder, agreeing to joint custody of R.B. with primary placement of R.B. to be\r\nwith Wife. The order also provided for reasonable and liberal visitation\r\nprivileges to Husband. In addition, the temporary consent order provided that\r\nHusband continue to pay R.B.'s monthly school tuition directly to Wife and\r\nallowed Wife to retain possession of the marital home. Several months later,\r\nthe parties returned to court and modified the temporary consent order to\r\nrequire Husband to pay the mortgage on the marital home, while being\r\nreimbursed for a portion of the mortgage by the Wife. In addition, the\r\ntemporary consent order mutually prohibited the parties from \"disposing,\r\nselling, transferring, destroying, or giving away any property of the marriage\r\n\nwithout the written consent of the other or by further Order\" of the family\r\ncourt.In June 2008, Husband and Wife returned yet again to family court. At\r\nthis hearing, the parties agreed to grant visitation to Husband consistent with\r\nthe standard visitation schedule. In its second temporary consent order, the\r\nfamily court appointed a guardian ad litem, imposed a mutual restraining\r\norder on the parties, and required the parties to attend family counseling.\r\nWife subsequently moved for a rule to show cause after Husband\r\nencumbered marital assets and entered the marital home without Wife's\r\npermission and in violation of the restraining order. The family court found\r\nHusband in contempt for entering the marital home without Wife's consent\r\nand ordered him to pay Wife's attorney's fees for the hearing.\r\n\r\n      On November 25, 2008, Husband and Wife entered into a final consent\r\norder to address several financial matters. The parties agreed Husband would\r\ntake possession of the marital home and pay Wife $31,500 for her share of\r\nthe equity in the parties' home. The parties also agreed to the distribution of\r\ncertain personal property, determined the Husband's IRA was marital\r\nproperty, and agreed Wife would be responsible for one-half of the balance\r\nfor her plastic surgery. Additionally, in an order dated September 25, 2009,\r\nthe family court granted the parties a divorce for \"living separate and apart\r\nwithout cohabitation for a period of one year\" pursuant to section 20-3-10(5)\r\nof the South Carolina Code (1976).\r\n\r\n      At the final hearing on November 5, 2009, the family court received\r\ntestimony from the parties, their witnesses, and the guardian ad litem. After\r\ncarefully weighing the evidence, the family court found \"both parents love\r\nthe minor child,\" but it concluded \"the best interest of the child would be\r\nserved for the current joint custodial situation to continue with primary\r\nplacement being with [Wife], with liberal visitation to [Husband].\" The\r\nfamily court also received into evidence financial documents pertaining to the\r\nparties' income and some evidence regarding the assets and debts of the\r\nmarital estate, including Husband's business, Landscape Supply. In its\r\ndecision to divide the marital estate, the family court awarded both real and\r\n\npersonal property to each party; however, the family court did not properly\r\nvalue all of the assets and debts it awarded. In addition, the family court\r\nawarded Wife attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\n     On December 11, 2009, Husband timely filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\nmotion seeking to alter or amend the final order. The family court\r\nsubsequently denied Husband's motion. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      On appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal\r\nissues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666,\r\n667 (2011); Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651-52\r\n(2011). Although this court reviews the family court's findings de novo, we\r\nare not required to ignore the fact that the family court, which saw and heard\r\nthe witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign\r\ncomparative weight to their testimony. Lewis, 392 S.C. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n651-52. The burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the\r\nfamily court erred in its findings. Id.\r\n\r\n                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.    Equitable Division\r\n\r\n       Husband asserts the family court improperly assessed the fair market\r\nvalue of the assets and debts of the parties and erred in dividing the property.\r\nSpecifically, Husband contests (1) the valuation of the Highway 25 property;\r\n(2) the failure to include Landscape Supply as a marital debt; and (3) the\r\nfailure to assign a specific value to all of the assets and debts of the marriage.\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\n       Section 20-3-620(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) provides\r\nthat the family court must consider fifteen factors in apportioning the marital\r\n\nestate and give each factor its proper weight.1 These criteria are intended to\r\nguide the family court in exercising its discretion over apportionment of\r\nmarital property. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 297, 372 S.E.2d 107,\r\n112 (Ct. App. 1988). Utilizing these fifteen factors, the family court must:\r\n(1) identify the marital property to be divided between the parties; (2)\r\ndetermine the fair market value of the property; (3) apportion the marital\r\nestate according to the contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to\r\nthe acquisition of the property during the marriage, their respective assets and\r\nincomes, and any special equities they may have in marital assets; and (4)\r\nprovide for an equitable division of the marital estate, including the manner\r\nin which the distribution is to take place. Gardner v. Gardner, 368 S.C. 134,\r\n136, 628 S.E.2d 37, 38 (2006).\r\n1 Section 20-3-620(B) lists the following fifteen factors the family court must\r\nconsider: (1) the duration of the marriage along with the ages of the parties at\r\nthe time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce; (2) marital\r\nmisconduct or fault of either or both parties, if the misconduct affects or has\r\naffected the economic circumstances of the parties or contributed to the\r\nbreakup of the marriage; (3) the value of the marital property and the\r\ncontribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation, depreciation, or\r\nappreciation in value of the marital property, including the contribution of the\r\nspouse as homemaker; (4) the income of each spouse, the earning potential of\r\neach spouse, and the opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets; (5)\r\nthe health, both physical and emotional, of each spouse; (6) either spouse's\r\nneed for additional training or education in order to achieve that spouse's\r\nincome potential; (7) the nonmarital property of each spouse; (8) the\r\nexistence or nonexistence of vested retirement benefits for either spouse; (9)\r\nwhether separate maintenance or alimony has been awarded; (10) the\r\ndesirability of awarding the family home as part of equitable distribution or\r\nthe right to live in it for reasonable periods to the spouse having custody of\r\nany children; (11) the tax consequences to either party as a result of equitable\r\napportionment; (12) the existence and extent of any prior support obligations;\r\n(13) liens and any other encumbrances on the marital property and any other\r\nexisting debts; (14) child custody arrangements and obligations at the time of\r\nthe entry of the order; and (15) any other relevant factors that the family court\r\nexpressly enumerates in its order.\r\n\n       Here, the family court failed to make the appropriate findings in\r\napportioning the marital estate. The family court did not identify all the\r\nparties' marital property, but instead selectively divided certain real and\r\npersonal property without determining the fair market value of all the\r\nproperty. In particular, the family court did not determine the fair market\r\nvalue of Landscape Supply, which constituted a considerable debt of the\r\nmarriage. Moreover, the family court failed to determine the direct and\r\nindirect contributions of the parties to the acquisition of the marital property.\r\nIt is unclear from our review of the record the value of the marital estate or\r\nthe fairness of the overall apportionment. Additionally, counsel for both\r\nHusband and Wife conceded during oral argument that the family court never\r\nplaced a value on Landscape Supply or the entire marital estate.\r\n\r\n       We, therefore, reverse the family court's division of the parties' marital\r\nproperty and remand the issue. In determining the property division, the\r\nfamily court shall identify all marital property and the contributions of each\r\nparty consistent with the findings in this opinion. See § 20-3-620(B); see\r\nalso Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n(holding section 20-3-620(B)(13) creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt\r\nof either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is marital debt and must be\r\nfactored in the totality of equitable apportionment); Rowland v. Rowland,\r\n295 S.C. 131, 132-133, 367 S.E.2d 434, 435 (Ct. App. 1988) (remanding the\r\nissue of equitable distribution when the family court failed to make findings\r\non the parties' contributions and on other factors).\r\n\r\n   II.   Best Interests of R.B.\r\n\r\n      Husband contends the family court abused its discretion in granting\r\nprimary placement of R.B. with Wife. In addition, Husband asserts the\r\nfamily court erred in modifying the visitation schedule and the method of\r\nmaking child support payments.\r\n\n         a. Primary Placement\r\n\r\n     Husband argues the family court abused its discretion in awarding\r\nprimary placement of R.B. to Wife. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       In a child custody case, the welfare of the child and what is in the\r\nchild's best interest are the primary, paramount, and controlling\r\nconsiderations of the family court. Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588\r\nS.E.2d 102, 103-04 (2003). In determining the best interest of the child, the\r\nfamily court considers several factors, including: \"who has been the primary\r\ncaretaker; the conduct, attributes, and fitness of the parents; the opinions of\r\nthird parties (including GAL, expert witnesses, and the children); and the age,\r\nhealth, and sex of the children.\" Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d\r\n386, 388 (2001). In other words, \"the totality of the circumstances peculiar to\r\neach case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be\r\nweighed.\" Parris v. Parris, 319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1995)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Husband contends the best interests of the child would be served by\r\ngranting him primary placement of R.B. In support of this contention,\r\nHusband asserts that while Wife had primary placement of the child, R.B. did\r\nnot have his own room to sleep in and often witnessed fights between Wife's\r\nbrother and Wife's father. In addition, Husband testified that when R.B. was\r\npicked up for Boy Scouts, he often lacked shoes, socks, and underwear.\r\nMoreover, Husband presented evidence of unsanitary conditions in the\r\nmarital home when Wife and R.B. lived there as an additional reason why the\r\nbest interests of the child would be served by granting primary placement of\r\nR.B. with Husband.\r\n\r\n      The family court properly considered this evidence and other testimony\r\non the strengths and weaknesses of each parent and weighed the totality of\r\ncircumstances in determining the child's best interests would be served by\r\nawarding custody to Wife. After hearing extensive testimony on the custody\r\nissue from the parties and several character witnesses, and after reviewing the\r\nguardian ad litem's report, the family court made in-depth findings to support\r\n\nits decision to award primary placement of the child to Wife. We find ample\r\nsupport in the record for these findings.\r\n\r\n       Initially, the family court found Wife has been the primary caretaker of\r\nR.B. and continued to do so since the parties separated and agreed to have\r\njoint custody of R.B. The family court also considered the spiritual aspect of\r\nthe child's life in noting Wife has \"carried the minor child to church and\r\nchurch activities since he was very young.\" Additionally, the family court\r\nnoted that although Wife lives with her parents, R.B. has a very close\r\nrelationship with the maternal grandparents and he has excellent living\r\naccommodations, including a separate bedroom.\r\n\r\n       In addition, the child's education is a proper factor for consideration in\r\ndetermining custody. See Glanton v. Glanton, 314 S.C. 58, 60, 443 S.E.2d\r\n810, 812 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"The education of a child is something that affects\r\nhis best interest.\"). The family court entertained testimony from Wife, R.B.'s\r\ntutor, and Husband's mother, who all recounted Wife's efforts to improve\r\nR.B.'s education. Based upon this testimony, the family court concluded\r\nR.B.'s learning disability required him to repeat the first grade. The family\r\ncourt further found Wife fully recognizes the scope of R.B.'s learning\r\ndisability and took the affirmative step to employ a tutor to help R.B.\r\nMoreover, the family court found Wife \"aided the tutor and has participated\r\nwith the remedial procedures for the child's improvement\" and noted R.B.'s\r\n\"current grades are exceptional for the Fall Semester of 2009.\" Wife's\r\napproach to the child's education, coupled with the child's improved\r\nperformance while in Wife's primary care, supports the family court's award\r\nof primary placement to Wife. Glanton, 314 S.C. at 60, 443 S.E.2d at 812.\r\n\r\n      The family court's findings show it properly considered the fitness of\r\neach parent and the relevant factors that would affect R.B.'s best interests in\r\nmaking its custody and placement determination. See Pirayesh v. Pirayesh,\r\n359 S.C. 284, 296, 596 S.E.2d 505, 512 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"When determining\r\nto whom custody shall be awarded, the court should consider all the\r\ncircumstances of the particular case and all relevant factors must be taken\r\n\ninto consideration.\"). Accordingly, the family court did not err in awarding\r\nprimary placement of R.B. with Wife.\r\n\r\n         b. Visitation Schedule\r\n\r\n       Next, Husband asserts the family court erred in failing to adopt the\r\nvisitation schedule set forth in the temporary order.2 We disagree.\r\n\r\n      As an initial matter, we note Husband abandoned this issue on appeal.\r\nIn Husband's brief, he fails to cite any supporting authority for his position,\r\nand all arguments are merely conclusory statements. See Wright v. Craft,\r\n372 S.C. 1, 20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding an issue listed\r\nin the statement of issues on appeal but not addressed in the brief is\r\nabandoned); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 99, 594 S.E.2d 485, 496 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2004) (holding when an issue is not argued within the body of the brief\r\nbut is only a short, conclusory statement, it is abandoned on appeal). We\r\naddress this issue, however, because \"procedural rules are subservient to the\r\ncourt's duty to zealously guard the rights of minors.\" Joiner ex rel. Rivas v.\r\nRivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000).\r\n\r\n      As with child custody, the welfare and best interests of the child are the\r\nprimary considerations in determining visitation. Woodall v. Woodall, 322\r\nS.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996). Similarly, visitation is addressed to\r\n2 Husband asserts the family court modified the visitation times in the final\r\norder contrary to the visitation schedule set forth in the temporary order\r\nwithout his consent. We take this opportunity to reiterate that temporary\r\nhearings are not de facto final hearings, and we adhere to the principle that\r\ntemporary orders must be without prejudice to the rights of the parties at the\r\nfinal hearing. See Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 527 n.6, 605 S.E.2d 572,\r\n575 n.6 (Ct. App. 2004). As this court aptly stated in Rimer, \"To assign\r\nweight to the amount of support awarded pendente lite or view the award as\r\nhaving any precedential value at the merits hearing or on appeal would\r\ndiscourage parties from amicably agreeing upon temporary support for fear\r\nthe slightest concession would prejudice their position at the final hearing.\"\r\nId.\r\n\nthe broad discretion of the family court and its decision will not be disturbed\r\non appeal absent abuse. Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 191, 531\r\nS.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\n       At the merits hearing, Husband wanted the same visitation schedule as\r\nset forth in the temporary consent order. Wife requested three changes to the\r\nvisitation schedule in the temporary consent order at the final hearing,\r\narguing the changes were in the best interests of the child. Wife asked the\r\nfamily court to alter the weekend visitation dates so R.B. could play with a\r\ncousin similar in age who has visitation with Wife's brother on those\r\nparticular weekends. In addition, Wife asked the family court to order the\r\nMonday evening visitation to conclude at 8 p.m. because 9 p.m. is R.B.'s\r\nusual bedtime and R.B. was getting home too late. Finally, Wife requested\r\nthe family court order the Christmas visitation schedule to allow R.B. to\r\nparticipate in her family's Christmas activities. The family court agreed with\r\nWife and concluded the welfare and best interests of R.B. were served in\r\nordering the changes. In doing so, the family court ordered the following\r\nvisitation schedule:\r\n\r\n            (1) Husband shall have three non-consecutive weeks\r\n               of visitation in the summer with the weeks running\r\n               from Sunday at 6pm until Sunday at 6pm and the\r\n               first week shall be the third week of June, the\r\n               second week being the first week of July and the\r\n               third week being the first week of August.\r\n            (2) Husband \t hall have Thanksgiving visitation\r\n                            s\r\n               starting when the child gets out of school and\r\n               going to Sunday at 6pm on even years and the\r\n               Mother having odd years.\r\n            (3) Husband shall always get visitation for the\r\n               weekend when Father's Day occurs and Wife shall\r\n               get visitation for the weekend when Mother's Day\r\n               occurs.\r\n\n           (4) Weekend \t   visitation will be switched with\r\n              Husband having two (2) consecutive weeks to\r\n              allow for this change.\r\n           (5) Husband shall have weekly visitation every\r\n              Monday evening from 5:00 p.m.-8:00 p.m. for boy\r\n              scouts or on any weekday evening that the boy\r\n              scouts meet and any other times the parties agree.\r\n           (6) Husband will have the child from the beginning\r\n              of Christmas vacation until 10:30 a.m. on\r\n              Christmas morning. Wife will have the child from\r\n              10:30 a.m. Christmas morning until school\r\n              resumes.\r\n\r\n       It is clear from our review of the record that Wife's requests were for\r\nthe benefit of R.B. and the family court considered the welfare and best\r\ninterests of the child in determining visitation. See Woodall, 322 S.C. at 12,\r\n471 S.E.2d at 158 (holding the welfare and best interests of the child are the\r\nprimary considerations in determining visitation). Moreover, we conclude\r\nthat Husband has failed to establish that the family court abused its\r\ndiscretion. Paparella, 340 S.C. at 191, 531 S.E.2d at 300. Accordingly, the\r\nfamily court did not err in entering an appropriate visitation schedule at the\r\nfinal hearing on the merits.\r\n\r\n        c. Child Support Payments\r\n\r\n      Husband also contends the family court erred in determining he is\r\nrequired to make child support payments through the clerk of court. We\r\nagree.In the instant case, the family court made the following pertinent\r\nfinding of fact:\r\n\r\n           I find that the respective incomes of the parties\r\n           remains virtually the same as when child support was\r\n           ordered in the Temporary Order and shall continue to\r\n\n            be paid in the amount of Four Hundred Thirty-Three\r\n            and 00/100 ($433.00) Dollars per month, together\r\n            with costs, to the Clerk of Court for Abbeville\r\n            County.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). However, this finding of fact is inconsistent with the\r\nfamily court's conclusion of law that Husband's child support payments \"will\r\ncontinue to be paid in the amount and method he currently pays.\" (emphasis\r\nadded). The testimony presented at trial by both Husband and Wife\r\nestablished Husband consistently made his payments directly to Wife.\r\nRegardless of the contradictory nature of the family court's order with regard\r\nto the child support payments, Wife states in her brief she has no objection to\r\nHusband directly depositing the payment into her account. Accordingly,\r\nHusband is required to make child support payments in the same amount as\r\npreviously ordered by the family court, but he is permitted to directly deposit\r\nthe payment into Wife's banking account, thereby avoiding any additional\r\ncosts assessed by the Clerk of Court for Abbeville County.\r\n\r\n    III. Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\n      Last, Husband argues the family court abused its discretion in awarding\r\n$8,000 in attorney's fees to Wife. Specifically, Husband argues the family\r\ncourt did not make the necessary findings of fact regarding each of the\r\nGlasscock3 factors. We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n      \"An issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal. In order to\r\npreserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n[family] court.\" In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732\r\n(2004). At trial, counsel for Wife and Husband both submitted affidavits for\r\n3 Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991),\r\nsets forth the following factors to be considered in determining the amount of\r\nattorney's fees to be awarded: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case;\r\n(2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) counsel's professional\r\nstanding; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results\r\nobtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services.\r\n\nattorney's fees incurred in the representation of their respective clients during\r\nthe course of litigation. Husband did not challenge Wife's fee affidavit at the\r\nhearing and, therefore, failed to procure a ruling from the family court on this\r\nissue. See Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d\r\n544, 544 (1970) (holding an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of\r\nthe case and requires affirmance); Smith v. Smith, 386 S.C. 251, 273, 687\r\nS.E.2d 720, 732 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating to preserve an issue for appellate\r\nreview, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the court).\r\n\r\n      While Husband failed to challenge the attorney's fees affidavit\r\npresented by Wife's counsel at trial, he did raise a general argument in a\r\nsubsequent Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion stating, \"the Court required\r\n[Husband] to pay large sums of money to [Wife], her attorney, and the\r\nguardian ad litem within 180 days when the record clearly establishes\r\nthrough expert testimony that [Husband] does not have the ability to borrow\r\nany money or to pay those sums within that time frame.\" Although Husband\r\nobjects to what he contends is an unreasonable period of time to pay, his\r\nargument is not based on a specific challenge to an award of attorney's fees.\r\nFurther, any request at the 59(e) stage of the proceedings was untimely\r\nbecause Husband could have raised this issue at trial. See S.C. Dep't of\r\nTransp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903,\r\n907 (2007) (\"[A]n issue may not be raised for the first time in a post-trial\r\nmotion.\"). Accordingly, we find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      In summary, we find the family court erred in dividing the marital\r\nestate and reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion. However, we affirm the family court's decision with regard to\r\nprimary placement of the minor child and the visitation schedule. In\r\naddition, the family court's ruling as to the method of child support payments\r\nis reversed. Because Husband failed to properly preserve the issue of\r\nattorney's fees, we affirm the family court's ruling on this issue. Accordingly,\r\nthe family court's order is\r\n\n   AFFIRMED IN PART,        REVERSED   IN   PART,   AND\r\nREMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\n   SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4983","title":"State v.

We hold that the\r\n\nticket officers issued to James Ramsey for CDV did not commence judicial\r\nproceedings. We affirm the dismissal of the charge.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nOn February 18, 2006, officers responded to a call from Ramsey's estranged wife\r\nand arrested him for burglary and CDV. The officers issued Ramsey a uniform\r\ntraffic ticket for the CDV. They did not seek an arrest warrant on that charge.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held a preliminary hearing on the burglary charge. Finding a lack\r\nof probable cause, the court dismissed the burglary and remanded the CDV to the\r\nmagistrate court. Ramsey then made a motion to dismiss the CDV for lack of\r\nprobable cause. The magistrate granted the motion, and the circuit court affirmed.\r\nThe supreme court reversed and remanded, holding magistrates may not conduct\r\npreliminary hearings in cases within their trial jurisdiction. State v. Ramsey, 381\r\nS.C. 375, 377-78, 673 S.E.2d 428, 429 (2009).\r\n\r\nOn remand, Ramsey made another motion to dismiss. He argued his case was not\r\nproperly before the magistrate court because service of the ticket on him did not\r\ncommence proceedings in that court. The magistrate granted the motion, holding\r\nservice of a uniform traffic ticket for CDV first offense does not commence\r\nproceedings in the magistrate court if an officer did not see the offense being\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court affirmed on a different ground. It held that with the exception of\r\noffenses listed in section 56-7-10 of the South Carolina Code, proceedings do not\r\nbegin in magistrate court until an arrest warrant is issued and served. Because\r\nCDV is not listed in that section and an arrest warrant was not issued for the\r\ncharge, the circuit court concluded the magistrate properly dismissed the case.\r\n\r\n      II.    Commencement of Proceedings in Magistrate Court\r\n\r\nSection 22-3-710 of the South Carolina Code (2007) provides \"[a]ll proceedings\r\nbefore magistrates in criminal cases shall be commenced on information under\r\noath, plainly and substantially setting forth the offense charged, upon which, and\r\nonly which, shall a warrant of arrest issue.\" Under this section, and subject to\r\nexceptions we will discuss, the State may not commence judicial proceedings in\r\nthe magistrate court without first obtaining an arrest warrant. See Bayly v. State,\r\n___ S.C. ___, ___, 724 S.E.2d 182, 184-85 (2012) (discussing section 56-7-10's\r\nelimination in limited circumstances of the requirement for an arrest warrant in\r\n\norder to commence judicial proceedings in the magistrate court); State v. Fennell,\r\n263 S.C. 216, 220, 209 S.E.2d 433, 434 (1974) (finding it necessary to have an\r\narrest warrant to commence judicial proceedings in the magistrate court unless an\r\nexception applied); State v. Praser, 173 S.C. 284, 286, 175 S.E. 551, 551 (1934)\r\n(affirming the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus on the basis that, under the\r\nprecursor to section 22-3-710, the municipal court had no power to hear a case as\r\nto which no arrest warrant was issued).\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the Legislature created an exception to the warrant requirement of section\r\n22-3-710. Under what is now codified as section 56-7-10, law enforcement\r\nofficers may use a uniform traffic ticket in arrests for \"traffic offenses\" and\r\noffenses listed in the section. S.C. Code Ann. § 56-7-10 (Supp. 2011). The section\r\ngoes on to provide: \"The service of the uniform traffic ticket shall vest all traffic,\r\nrecorders', and magistrates' courts with jurisdiction[1] to hear and to dispose of the\r\ncharge for which the ticket was issued and served.\" Id. Through these provisions,\r\nsection 56-7-10 \"eliminates the need for an arrest warrant and authorizes the use of\r\na uniform traffic ticket to notify an accused and commence judicial proceedings in\r\nthe magistrate court.\" Bayly, 724 S.E.2d at 184-85. Therefore, if the offense is a\r\ntraffic offense or is listed in section 56-7-10, an officer may make an arrest with a\r\nuniform traffic ticket, and the State may proceed to trial in the magistrate court\r\nwithout an arrest warrant. Id.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the Legislature enacted section 56-7-15, which provides that the uniform\r\ntraffic ticket \"may be used by law enforcement officers to arrest a person for an\r\noffense committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer if the punishment\r\nis within the jurisdiction[2] of magistrates court . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-7-\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The term \"jurisdiction\" in this section does not refer to a court's subject matter\r\njurisdiction, \"which is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the\r\ngeneral class to which the proceedings in question belong.\" State v. Gentry, 363\r\nS.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005). Rather, it refers to the fact that, as to\r\nappropriate charges, the section authorizes the use of a uniform traffic ticket to\r\nnotify an accused and commence judicial proceedings in the magistrate court.\r\n2In this section, \"jurisdiction\" refers to the subject matter jurisdiction of the\r\nmagistrate court. See Bayly, 724 S.E.2d at 186 (stating the enactment of section\r\n56-7-15 \"did not operate to increase the subject matter jurisdiction of the\r\nmagistrate court\").\r\n\n15(A) (Supp. 2011). This subsection \"specifically references section 56-7-10, to\r\nexpand the list of offenses for which a uniform traffic ticket may be used to arrest a\r\nperson\" and to commence proceedings in magistrate court. Bayly, 724 S.E.2d at\r\n186. Thus, if subsection 56-7-15(A) applies to an offense, the State may proceed\r\nto trial in the magistrate court using a uniform traffic ticket instead of an arrest\r\nwarrant. 724 S.E.2d at 186-87.\r\n\r\nUnder sections 56-7-10 and 56-7-15, therefore, there are three categories of\r\noffenses for which the State may use a uniform traffic ticket instead of an arrest\r\nwarrant to commence proceedings in the magistrate court: (1) traffic offenses; (2)\r\noffenses specifically listed in section 56-7-10; and (3) offenses within the subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction of the magistrate court that are committed in the presence of a\r\nlaw enforcement officer.\r\n\r\n      III.   Subsection 56-7-15(A) Does Not Apply to the Offense in this Case\r\n\r\nThe issue in this case is whether Ramsey's alleged offense fits within the third\r\ncategory. 3 In other words, because the State did not obtain an arrest warrant, it\r\nmay not proceed to trial in Ramsey's case unless we determine that despite the\r\nlanguage in subsection 56-7-15(A) limiting its application to offenses \"committed\r\nin the presence of a law enforcement officer,\" and despite the fact that no officer\r\nwas present when the CDV occurred, the State may use a uniform traffic ticket to\r\nformally charge Ramsey with CDV. We find the State did not properly commence\r\njudicial proceedings in this case because subsection 56-7-15(A) does not apply to\r\nRamsey's alleged offense.\r\n\r\nThe subsection does not apply because the offense was not committed in the\r\npresence of a law enforcement officer. Ramsey's estranged wife called 911 to\r\nreport that Ramsey had broken into her apartment. Ramsey is accused of injuring\r\nher hand in an effort to take the phone from her during the 911 call. As the State\r\nconcedes, no officer was present when any of this happened. The officers did not\r\narrive at Mrs. Ramsey's apartment until eleven minutes after she called 911.\r\nTherefore, the alleged offense does not fit into the third category of exceptions, and\r\nthe State cannot use the ticket to commence proceedings in the magistrate court.\r\nBecause the State never sought an arrest warrant, and because the use of a uniform\r\n\r\n3The magistrate court has subject matter jurisdiction over criminal domestic\r\nviolence, first offense. S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-20(B)(1) (Supp. 2011). The issue\r\nbefore us therefore involves only the \"committed in the presence\" requirement of\r\nsubsection 56-7-15(A).\r\n\ntraffic ticket to commence proceedings was not authorized under sections 56-7-10\r\nor 56-7-15, the magistrate could not hear the case.\r\n\r\n      IV.    The State's Arguments\r\n\r\nThe State makes several arguments in support of its position that the ticket served\r\non Ramsey did commence proceedings in the magistrate court. First, the State\r\nargues that the offense was \"freshly committed\" when the officers arrived, and that\r\na freshly committed offense was committed in the officer's presence. We agree the\r\noffense was freshly committed. We disagree, however, that a freshly committed\r\noffense is committed in an officer's presence.\r\n\r\nThe State's argument is based on a series of decisions in which our appellate courts\r\nheld that an officer may make a warrantless arrest for an offense not committed in\r\nthe officer's presence if the offense was \"freshly committed\" when the officer\r\narrived on the scene. For example, in State v. Martin, 275 S.C. 141, 143, 268\r\nS.E.2d 105, 106 (1980), the supreme court stated, \"while generally an officer\r\ncannot arrest, without a warrant, for a misdemeanor not committed in his presence,\r\nan officer can arrest for a misdemeanor when the facts and circumstances observed\r\nby the officer give him probable cause to believe that a crime has been freshly\r\ncommitted.\" 275 S.C. at 145-46, 268 S.E.2d at 107.\r\n\r\nRelying on Martin, the State argues an officer's observation of the aftermath of a\r\nfreshly committed offense satisfies the \"in the presence\" requirement of subsection\r\n56-7-15(A). The State is incorrect in arguing the reasoning of Martin applies to\r\nthis case. Martin actually illustrates that offenses committed in an officer's\r\npresence and \"freshly committed\" offenses are distinct concepts, such that an\r\noffense is \"freshly committed\" only if it is not committed \"in the presence of a law\r\nenforcement officer.\" The State's argument, however, equates these concepts.\r\nSuch a position is contrary to Martin, and to the Legislature's treatment of these\r\nconcepts in other statutes. See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-70(A)-(B) (Supp. 2011)\r\n(permitting an officer to arrest a suspect upon probable cause to believe the suspect\r\n\"is committing or has freshly committed\" a criminal domestic violence offense\r\n(emphasis added)); § 23-1-212(B)(3) (2007) (permitting a federal law enforcement\r\nofficer to enforce state criminal laws either when the crime is \"committed in the\r\nfederal law enforcement officer's presence or under circumstances indicating a\r\ncrime has been freshly committed\" (emphasis added)). Therefore, we reject the\r\nState's argument.\r\n\nSecond, the State argues the application of several rules of statutory construction\r\nindicates the Legislature intended that subsection 56-7-15(A) would authorize the\r\nuse of a uniform traffic ticket to commence judicial proceedings even when an\r\noffense was not committed in the officer's presence. We find the principle of\r\nstatutory construction that penal statutes are to be strictly construed against the\r\nState defeats the State's argument. See Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C.\r\n332, 342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283 (2011) (\"When a statute is penal in nature, it must\r\nbe strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant.\").\r\n\r\nThird, the State argues the supreme court already addressed the issue before us in\r\nthe first appeal of this case. We disagree. The first appeal involved only the\r\nquestion of whether the magistrate had the power to hold a probable cause hearing\r\non Ramsey's CDV charge. See Ramsey, 381 S.C. at 376, 673 S.E.2d at 428. We\r\nhave reviewed the briefs and record from Ramsey, and the applicability of\r\nsubsection 56-7-15(A) is not mentioned by either party or by the lower courts. We\r\nbelieve the supreme court's statement that Ramsey's \"CDV charge was within the\r\nmagistrate's jurisdiction,\" 381 S.C. at 377, 673 S.E.2d at 429, was a comment that\r\nthe magistrate court has subject matter jurisdiction over the type of offense with\r\nwhich Ramsey was charged, not a case-specific determination that the ticket served\r\non Ramsey commenced proceedings in the magistrate court.\r\n\r\nThe State's remaining arguments are not preserved, and therefore we do not\r\naddress them. See State v. Sheppard, 391 S.C. 415, 423, 706 S.E.2d 16, 20 (2011)\r\n(\"Our law is clear tha[t] an issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\").\r\n\r\n      V.     Conclusion\r\n\r\nSection 56-7-15(A) does not authorize the use of a uniform traffic ticket to\r\ncommence judicial proceedings in the magistrate court unless the offense charged\r\nwas \"committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer.\" Because officers\r\narrived on the scene after the alleged CDV ended, the service of the uniform traffic\r\nticket on Ramsey did not commence judicial proceedings, and the magistrate court\r\nproperly dismissed the charge. The decision of the circuit court to affirm the\r\nmagistrate court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4984","title":"State v.

His primary contention on appeal is\r\n\nthat the trial court erred in declining to charge the jury on criminal domestic\r\nviolence (CDV) as a lesser-included offense. We affirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nGolston and the victim lived together \"off and on\" for approximately five years.\r\nOn the morning of March 22, 2008, a neighbor found the victim lying on a\r\nmattress in her house. Her breathing was shallow and her face was so swollen that\r\nshe could not open her eyes. The neighbor called 911, and deputies and\r\nparamedics came to the victim's house. According to the deputies who responded\r\nto the scene, the victim told them Golston attacked her the previous night using his\r\nfists, a log, and a hatchet. The victim's adult son also came to her house. Her face\r\nwas so swollen that he did not recognize her. The son testified:\r\n\r\n             I went into the house, went to the back, and I saw my\r\n             momma laying there. That was my momma but that\r\n             wasn't my momma. I wasn't prepared for that. I worked\r\n             at Rocket Rescue1 for about two years, and I've seen\r\n             wrecks with fatalities. I've never seen anybody's face\r\n             swollen like that. If she hadn't talked, I wouldn't have\r\n             known that was my momma.\r\n\r\nThe paramedics drove the victim to a hospital, where doctors ordered a CAT scan\r\nand a blood test for internal trauma. Although the CAT scan revealed no bone\r\nfractures and the blood test results were normal, a nurse testified \"the doctor\r\ndocumented that she was so swollen he couldn't do the type of exam that he wanted\r\nto do to make sure that she could have vision.\" The victim left the hospital that\r\nnight with her children. Over the next few days, she continued to have difficulty\r\nbreathing and could not feed or bathe herself. The swelling continued to prevent\r\nher from opening both of her eyes. She was able to open her right eye after four or\r\nfive days, but she could not open her left eye for about a week and a half. When\r\nshe finally was able to open her eyes and doctors examined them, she began\r\nwearing glasses for the first time.\r\n\r\nGolston was indicted and tried for CDVHAN. At trial, the State and Golston\r\npresented conflicting accounts of the incident. The victim testified Golston came\r\n\r\n1It is not clear from the record what the son meant by \"Rocket Rescue,\" but it\r\nappears the phrase is a colloquialism for emergency medical services companies.\r\n\nhome between 11:00 p.m. and midnight, smelling of alcohol, and told her he\r\nshould beat her up for allowing another man inside \"our home\" earlier that day.2\r\nGolston hit her \"many, many, many times\" in the face with his fists. She managed\r\nto get outside to her car, but he pulled her out of the car before she could start it.\r\nAs she lay on the ground, Golston straddled her and continued beating her in the\r\nface. As he hit her, Golston said that she disrespected him by letting another man\r\ninto the house and that he should kill her. She thought she was going to die.\r\nGolston then raised a hatchet over the victim, brought it down slowly, and rubbed\r\nthe blade on her skin. While he rubbed the blade on her, he again said he should\r\nkill her. She begged him not to strike her with the hatchet. He raised the hatchet\r\nover his head, but then dropped it and walked away. The victim could not stand up\r\nand asked Golston for help. He started to pick her up, but then shoved her back to\r\nthe ground and left.\r\n\r\nGolston testified to a different version of events. According to his testimony, when\r\nhe arrived at the house, the victim met him outside and was furious. She said \"I'm\r\ngoing\" and began walking off. As she walked away, Golston followed her and\r\nsaid, \"Where you going? You ain't going nowhere.\" Without provocation, the\r\nvictim then turned around, jumped on him, and clawed his face with her\r\nfingernails, cutting his face. He testified, \"I slapped her, both sides of the face\"\r\nand \"she fell.\" He then went into the house, washed his face, and retrieved his\r\nhatchet. When he went back outside, she asked him for help getting up. He placed\r\nthe hatchet on her car, helped her walk back to the house, and left.\r\n\r\nGolston requested a jury charge on CDV as a lesser-included offense of\r\nCDVHAN.3 He also requested a charge on self-defense. The trial court found that\r\ndepending on whether the jury believed the State or Golston, he either was guilty\r\nof CDVHAN or acted in self-defense and thus was not guilty. The trial court\r\ntherefore charged the jury on self-defense but not on CDV. The jury found\r\nGolston guilty, and the trial court sentenced him to ten years in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The other man was a longtime friend of the victim. He and his wife had helped\r\nthe victim move furniture that day.\r\n3Golston also requested a charge on simple assault and battery, but does not\r\nchallenge on appeal the trial court's decision not to charge it.\r\n\n      II.    CDV as a Lesser-Included Offense of CDVHAN\r\n\r\nA person is guilty of CDV when the State proves he either \"cause[d] physical harm\r\nor injury to [his] own household member,\" or \"offer[ed] or attempt[ed] to cause\r\nphysical harm or injury to [his] own household member with apparent present\r\nability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-25-20(A), (B) (Supp. 2011). A person is guilty of CDVHAN when, in\r\naddition to proving CDV, the State proves one of the aggravating circumstances set\r\nforth in subsection 16-25-65(A) of the Code, such as that the defendant's conduct\r\n\"result[ed] in serious bodily injury to the victim.\" § 16-25-65(A)(1) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nIn most prosecutions for CDVHAN, there will be evidence the defendant\r\ncommitted acts which constitute only CDV in addition to acts which constitute\r\nCDVHAN. In this case, for example, Golston's statement to the victim \"you ain't\r\ngoing nowhere\" and his admitted \"slap[ping] her face\" could be found by a jury to\r\namount only to CDV and not CDVHAN. However, the mere existence of evidence\r\nthat Golston committed these acts in addition to other acts which could constitute\r\nCDVHAN, such as beating the victim with his fists so severely that her own son\r\ncould not recognize her and she could not open one of her eyes for ten days, does\r\nnot warrant a jury charge on simple CDV. Rather, to warrant a jury charge on the\r\nlesser offense, the evidence viewed as a whole must be such that the jury could\r\nconclude the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense instead of the indicted\r\noffense. State v. Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 428, 361 S.E.2d 329, 335 (1987) (\"A trial\r\njudge is required to charge the jury on a lesser included offense if there is evidence\r\nfrom which it could be inferred the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was\r\ncommitted.\"). In other words, the existence of evidence that Golston committed\r\nsimple CDV in addition to CDVHAN does not warrant the charge. There must be\r\nevidence from which the jury could conclude the defendant committed only the\r\nlesser offense. See State v. Brown, 269 S.C. 491, 495-96, 238 S.E.2d 174, 176\r\n(1977) (\"The trial judge committed no error in refusing to charge simple assault\r\nand battery since there was no evidence tending to show appellant was only guilty\r\nof the lesser offense.\").\r\n\r\nTherefore, the task of the trial court in deciding whether to charge the lesser\r\noffense, and of this court reviewing that decision on appeal, is to examine the\r\nrecord to determine if there is evidence upon which the jury could find the\r\n\ndefendant was guilty of the lesser offense, but not guilty of the greater offense.4 In\r\nthis case, the jury could have found Golston not guilty of any offense if it\r\ndetermined the State failed to prove he was the person who assaulted the victim, or\r\nfailed to disprove at least one element of self-defense.5 It is also possible the jury\r\ncould have determined Golston committed some act which constituted CDV.\r\nHowever, there is no evidence in the record that anyone else caused injury to the\r\nvictim. Therefore, if the State proved Golston committed CDV, then he was\r\nnecessarily the person whose attack caused all of the victim's injuries. There is no\r\nevidence in the record upon which the jury could have found that those injuries\r\nwere not \"serious bodily injur[ies]\" under subsection 16-25-65(A)(1). Under these\r\ncircumstances, it was not possible for the jury to find Golston guilty of CDV but\r\nnot guilty of CDVHAN.\r\n\r\nGolston makes several arguments in support of his position that the charge should\r\nhave been given. First, he argues simply that whether the victim's injuries were\r\n\"serious\" under subsection 16-25-65(A)(1) is a question of fact, and if the jury\r\nfound the injuries were not serious, he could be guilty only of CDV. In support of\r\nthis argument, Golston points out the phrase \"serious bodily injury\" is not defined\r\nin the statute,6 indicating the Legislature's intent that the question be decided by a\r\n\r\n4 In making this inquiry, we are mindful that Golston had no burden of proof.\r\nHowever, we are not permitted to speculate that the jury might not have believed\r\nsome of the evidence that was presented. See State v. Franks, 376 S.C. 621, 624,\r\n658 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 2008) (\"The mere contention that the jury might\r\naccept the State's evidence in part and reject it in part is insufficient to satisfy the\r\nrequirement that some evidence tend to show the defendant was guilty of only the\r\nlesser offense.\").\r\n5As to the State's burden to disprove self-defense, see State v. Bixby, 388 S.C. 528,\r\n553-54, 698 S.E.2d 572, 585-86 (2010) (stating self-defense consists of four\r\nelements, and when a defendant raises that defense, the State bears the burden of\r\ndisproving at least one of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt).\r\n6\"Serious bodily injury\" is defined in another section of the Code as \"a physical\r\ncondition which creates a substantial risk of death, serious personal disfigurement,\r\nor protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member or organ.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 23-31-400(A)(2) (2007). We do not decide whether that\r\ndefinition applies to subsection 16-25-65(A)(1). However, even if we decided it\r\ndid, we do not believe there is any evidence in the record that the victim's injuries\r\n\njury. We agree there will be many instances in which the question is one for the\r\njury. However, just as in situations where minor injuries cannot possibly be found\r\nby a jury to be serious, and therefore the defendant cannot be guilty of CDVHAN,\r\nwe find the victim's injuries in this case cannot possibly be found not to be serious.\r\nThe only evidence in the record is that the blows to the victim's face caused\r\nswelling so severe that her son could not recognize her, she had difficulty\r\nbreathing and feeding herself for several days, and she could not open one of her\r\neyes for ten days. The doctors were so concerned by the severity of the injuries to\r\nher face that they ordered a CAT scan and testing for internal trauma. The beating\r\ncaused such severe swelling that doctors were initially unable to examine her eyes,\r\nbut when they could, they found permanent injury in that she had to wear glasses\r\nfor the first time. We disagree with Golston that a jury could possibly find these\r\ninjuries were not serious.\r\n\r\nGolston also argues the jury could have found the State failed to prove two other\r\naggravating circumstances: \"an assault and battery which involves the use of a\r\ndeadly weapon\" under subsection 16-25-65(A)(1), and \"an assault . . . which would\r\nreasonably cause a person to fear imminent serious bodily injury or death\" under\r\nsubsection 16-25-65(A)(2). Additionally, as to the serious bodily injury\r\naggravating circumstance, Golston argues the victim did not suffer any broken\r\nbones, she did not permanently lose her eyesight, and there was no evidence she\r\nsustained cuts or required stitches. We find it unnecessary to address these\r\narguments because, as we have explained, the only evidence in the record is that\r\nthe injuries the victim did sustain were serious, and thus the State necessarily\r\nproved at least one aggravating circumstance—serious bodily injury. The fact that\r\nthere may be conflicting evidence as to other aggravating circumstances, or that\r\nthere may be other serious bodily injuries the victim did not sustain, does not affect\r\nthe existence of some serious bodily injury, and therefore the necessity that, on\r\nthese facts, Golston was either not guilty or guilty of CDVHAN.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the victim did not suffer\r\n\"serious bodily injury,\" it was not possible for the jury to find Golston guilty of\r\nCDV instead of CDVHAN. The trial court properly refused to charge CDV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not meet that definition, as she suffered temporary serious disfigurement to her\r\nface, protracted loss of the use of her eyes from the swelling, and permanent\r\nimpairment of vision.\r\n\n      III.   Other Issues\r\n\r\nGolston also argues the trial court erred in rejecting his challenge to the sufficiency\r\nof his indictment and in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the hatchet\r\ndeputies found in his house while executing a warrant for his arrest. We disagree\r\nand affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\nAs to the challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment: Evans v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n495, 508, 611 S.E.2d 510, 517 (2005) (stating the primary purposes of an\r\nindictment are to apprise the defendant \"of the elements of the offense and to allow\r\nhim to decide whether to plead guilty or stand trial, and to enable the circuit court\r\nto know what judgment to pronounce if the defendant is convicted\").\r\n\r\nAs to the motion to suppress: State v. Loftin, 276 S.C. 48, 51, 275 S.E.2d 575, 576\r\n(1981) (\"A valid arrest warrant implicitly grants police the limited authority to\r\nenter a suspect's residence 'when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.'\"\r\n(quoting Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980))); United States v. Green,\r\n599 F.3d 360, 375-76 (4th Cir. 2010) (\"Where law enforcement officers possess an\r\narrest warrant and probable cause to believe a suspect is in his home, the officers\r\nmay enter and search anywhere in that residence in which the suspect might be\r\nfound.\") (citing Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 332-33 (1990)); State v. Morris,\r\n395 S.C. 600, 605, 720 S.E.2d 468, 471 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating on appeal of the\r\ndenial of a motion to suppress, this court reviews a trial court's legal conclusions\r\nfor clear error and factual findings under the any-evidence standard).\r\n\r\n      IV.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find there is no evidence in the record upon which the jury could have found\r\nGolston committed CDV instead of CDVHAN, and therefore the trial court\r\nproperly refused to charge CDV as a lesser-included offense.

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nCranford's claim for benefits and medical treatment stems from an injury he\r\nsustained while working for Hutchinson. Hutchinson hired Cranford on June 26,\r\n2007, as a day laborer, to assist in assembling a steel building at one of\r\nHutchinson's project sites. On July 20, 2007, Cranford was working in a forklift\r\nbasket approximately ten feet above ground. Cranford testified the basket was\r\nlowered to the ground, and his co-worker climbed out of the basket. When\r\nCranford was raised back in the air, the basket began to tilt forcing Cranford to\r\njump out of the basket. Cranford sustained injuries to both hands, both arms, and\r\nhis back as a result of the fall.\r\n\r\nCranford was taken immediately to Conway Medical Center for treatment. Dr.\r\nMichael Ellis treated the lacerations on Cranford's arms and noted Cranford\r\ncomplained of mid-lumbar pain when he would sit upright. Dr. Ellis discharged\r\nCranford with instructions to refrain from \"heavy lifting or strenuous activity\" and\r\nto return the following week. At his follow-up visit, Dr. Ellis' notes reflect he\r\ninstructed Cranford to \"be taking it easy\" and to notify Dr. Ellis if he experienced\r\nany additional problems.\r\n\r\nCranford was out of work for three weeks, during which time Hutchinson paid him\r\n$265 per week in lieu of temporary disability benefits. When Cranford returned to\r\nwork on August 13, 2007, Hutchinson restricted him to light-duty activities, but\r\nthen Hutchinson terminated Cranford on August 31, 2007, for being unsafe on the\r\njob site. Hutchinson filed a Form 15 claiming Cranford was no longer entitled to\r\ntemporary compensation because Cranford had worked a minimum of fifteen days\r\nprior to his termination.\r\n\r\nAfter Hutchinson fired Cranford, he obtained employment with a greenhouse from\r\nearly September until November 21, 2007. While working at the greenhouse,\r\nCranford made deliveries, watered plants, and lifted fifty to sixty pound bags of\r\nfertilizer two to four times per day twice a week. He earned on average $163.96\r\nper week.\r\n\nCranford's complaints of back pain resurfaced following his brief employment with\r\nthe greenhouse. In response to his complaints of back pain, Hutchinson sent him\r\nto Doctor's Care on January 11, 2008. Doctor's Care restricted him from lifting\r\nmore than ten pounds and instructed him to return for a follow-up visit in one\r\nweek. Cranford returned ten weeks later on March 25, 2008. Doctor's Care then\r\nreferred him to an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. William Edwards.1\r\n\r\nCranford saw Dr. Edwards on May 15, 2008, with lower back complaints. Dr.\r\nEdwards' notes reflect that Cranford told him he had been out of work since his\r\ninitial injury. Dr. Edwards ordered an MRI on May 21, 2008, and Cranford\r\nreturned to Dr. Edwards on June 3, 2008. On June 3, 2008, Dr. Edwards\r\nconcluded Cranford had reached MMI with no evidence of permanent impairment.\r\nDr. Edwards noted Cranford could return to work with \"the use of good body\r\nmechanics and careful lifting techniques.\"\r\n\r\nUpon referral from Cranford's attorney, Cranford underwent a subsequent\r\nevaluation with Dr. Timothy Zgleszewski on July 22, 2008. Dr. Zgleszewski\r\ndiagnosed Cranford with sacroiliitis and opined to a reasonable degree of medical\r\ncertainty that Cranford was not at MMI and should remain out of work until further\r\ntesting and treatment were completed. Hutchinson refused to provide the treatment\r\nrecommended by Dr. Zgleszewski.\r\n\r\nAfter Cranford saw Dr. Edwards and Dr. Zgleszewski, he briefly worked at a\r\nmachinery plant as a machine operator from September 12, 2008 until November\r\n7, 2008. He testified this position did not require any heavy lifting responsibilities.\r\nCranford earned $469.98 per week as a machine operator before he was laid off by\r\nthe machinery plant.\r\n\r\nIn response to Hutchinson's refusal to provide additional medical treatment,\r\nCranford filed a Form 50 on January 15, 2009, in which he requested a hearing as\r\nwell as additional medical treatment for his back and arms and temporary disability\r\nbenefits. In response, Hutchinson timely filed a Form 51, admitting\r\nlaceration/disfigurement to the right and left arms and an injury to the back.\r\nHutchinson, however, maintained Cranford reached maximum medical\r\nimprovement (MMI) for all injuries and denied Cranford was entitled to temporary\r\ndisability benefits.\r\n\r\n1 Dr. Edwards' notes reflect that Cranford's mother also requested Doctor's Care\r\nrefer Cranford to Dr. Edwards for additional medical treatment.\r\n\nPrior to Cranford's hearing, he again returned to Dr. Zgleszewski on April 23,\r\n2009, with complaints of reoccurring lower back pain, occasional numbness in his\r\nhands, and problems with lifting and twisting. Dr. Zgleszewski opined Cranford\r\nsuffered a 10% impairment rating to his back and a 9% whole person impairment\r\nrating based on the scars on his arms.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner held a hearing on May 14, 2009. The commissioner\r\nsubsequently issued an order on September 28, 2009, awarding Cranford four\r\nweeks of compensation to his left arm and eight weeks of compensation to his right\r\narm for the disfigurement caused by his fall. The commissioner agreed with Dr.\r\nEdwards' conclusions that Cranford had suffered no permanent impairment to his\r\nback and consequently found a 0% disability to Cranford's back. In addition, the\r\nsingle commissioner found Cranford failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence that he was entitled to any temporary disability benefits or additional\r\nmedical treatment. Cranford appealed the single commissioner's order, and in a\r\nform order, the Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner in full. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial\r\nreview of workers' compensation decisions. Pierre v. Seaside Farms, Inc., 386\r\nS.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618 (2010). Under the APA, this court can reverse\r\nor modify the decision of the Appellate Panel when the substantial rights of the\r\nappellant have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law\r\nor is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\nconsidering the record as a whole. Transp. Ins. Co. & Flagstar Corp. v. S.C.\r\nSecond Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 427, 699 S.E.2d 687, 689-90 (2010).\r\n\r\nWhen the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate\r\nPanel are conclusive. Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 290, 599\r\nS.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004). In workers' compensation cases, the Appellate\r\nPanel is the ultimate finder of fact. Shealy v. Aiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535\r\nS.E.2d 438, 442 (2000). \"The final determination of witness credibility and the\r\nweight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.\" Frame v.\r\nResort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 528, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n(internal citation omitted). Accordingly, this court will not overturn a finding of\r\nfact by the Appellate Panel \"unless there is no reasonable probability that the facts\r\ncould be as related by a witness upon whose testimony the finding was based.\"\r\n\nLark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981) (internal\r\ncitation omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Temporary Disability Compensation\r\n\r\nCranford first claims the Appellate Panel erred in failing to order Hutchinson to\r\npay him temporary disability benefits. We agree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-120 of the South Carolina Code (1985) defines disability as the\r\n\"incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which an employee was receiving\r\nat the time of the injury in the same or some other employment.\" During the\r\nperiod of disability, an employer may pay temporary total or partial compensation,\r\nor salary in lieu of compensation, to the injured employee. See 25A S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Regs. 67-503(B) (Supp. 2011). Whether compensation is partial or total\r\ndepends on whether the employee is partially or totally incapacitated from the\r\ninjury. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 42-9-10, -20 (1985 & Supp. 2011), 25A S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Regs. 67-502(E), (F) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nTemporary disability benefits are triggered \"[w]hen an employee has been out of\r\nwork due to a reported work-related injury . . . for eight days[.]\" S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n42-9-260(A) (Supp. 2011). Once temporary disability payments have commenced,\r\nthese benefits \"may be terminated or suspended immediately at any time within the\r\none hundred fifty days if . . . the employee has returned to work; however, if the\r\nemployee does not remain at work for a minimum of fifteen days, temporary\r\ndisability payments must be resumed immediately[.]\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-\r\n260(B)(1) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\nWhen Hutchinson terminated Cranford's benefits, it claimed in its Form 15 that\r\nCranford was no longer entitled to compensation because he had been at work for\r\n\"at least 15 days and no temporary partial compensation was due.\" While Cranford\r\nwas at work for fifteen days prior to his termination, we disagree with Hutchinson's\r\nclaim that Cranford was no longer entitled to temporary compensation.\r\n\r\nWe find the case of Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 312 S.C. 250, 439 S.E.2d\r\n859 (Ct. App. 1993), aff'd as modified by Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317\r\nS.C. 306, 454 S.E.2d 320 (1996), is instructive. Grayson was employed with\r\nCarter Rhoad to lift and move furniture. Grayson, 312 S.C. at 252, 439 S.E.2d at\r\n860. In August 1990, he injured his back while working. Id. In December 1990,\r\n\nthe treating physician, Dr. Graziano, released him to return to work, although he\r\nadvised Grayson to be \"somewhat careful with lifting.\" Id. at 252-53, 439 S.E.2d\r\nat 860. Grayson returned to his job on December 17, 1990. Id. He testified that\r\nhe did his job the best he could, but was not able to do it as well as before his\r\ninjury, and that the work was causing him a lot of pain. Id. Three weeks later,\r\nCarter Rhoad terminated Grayson's employment. Id. Grayson claimed he was still\r\ndisabled and entitled to additional benefits. Id.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner found Grayson was in need of further medical treatment\r\nbut had not proven he was entitled to any additional temporary total disability\r\nbenefits. Id. The commissioner ordered Carter Rhoad to have Grayson evaluated\r\nby a neurologist and to provide any treatment the neurologist believed necessary.\r\nId. The commissioner also held that if Dr. Graziano or the neurologist excused\r\nGrayson from work, Carter Rhoad would have to pay temporary total disability\r\nbenefits during that time. Id.\r\n\r\nThe full commission affirmed the single commissioner's decision. Id. Grayson\r\npetitioned for judicial review. Id. Finding the decision was not supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence, the circuit court reversed and remanded for entry of an order\r\ncommencing temporary total benefits as of the date that Carter Rhoad fired\r\nGrayson, to run until further order of the commission. Id. Carter Rhoad appealed.\r\nId.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the court of appeals held the single commissioner's administrative\r\nfindings were \"clearly erroneous\" because they were based on a \"mistaken view of\r\nevidence.\" On writ of certoriari, the supreme court modified this court's opinion.\r\nSee Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, 454 S.E.2d 320 (1996).\r\nThe supreme court held that because Grayson was released with work restrictions,\r\nthere was in reality no evidence that Grayson's period of temporary total disability\r\never ended prior to his firing. Id. at 310, 454 S.E.2d at 322. Because Grayson's\r\nbenefits were never properly terminated in accordance with Regulation 67-504,2\r\nGrayson was entitled to have his temporary benefits reinstated. Id.\r\n\r\n2The relevant portion of Regs. 67-504 in effect at that time stated: \"When the\r\nclaimant reaches maximum medical improvement and the authorized health care\r\nprovider reports the claimant is able to return to work without restriction to the\r\nsame job or other suitable job, and such a job is provided by the employer, or the\r\nclaimant agrees he or she is able to return to work without restriction, the\r\nemployer's representative may suspend compensation benefits by complying with\r\nsection D below.\"\r\n\nLike Grayson, Cranford was injured while working for his employer and was paid\r\ntemporary compensation while out of work. Grayson was released to work with\r\nthe instructions to \"be somewhat careful with lifting.\" Similarly, Cranford's\r\ndischarge report from Conway Medical Center instructed Cranford to refrain from\r\n\"heavy lifting\" and \"strenuous activity.\" In addition, Dr. Ellis, the attending\r\nsurgeon at Conway Medical Center, instructed Cranford to \"take it easy.\" No other\r\nphysician treated Cranford prior to him returning to work; thus, as in Grayson,\r\nthere is no other evidence in the record Cranford was released to work without\r\nrestriction.\r\n\r\nBoth employers terminated their employees shortly after the employees returned to\r\nwork while the employees were still under work restrictions. Grayson was fired\r\nfor not having a driver's license and Cranford was fired for being unsafe on the job\r\nsite.3 Both terminations occurred approximately three weeks after returning to\r\nwork. Prior to the firing, Grayson signed a Form 17, agreeing he was able to return\r\nto work. Cranford, on the other hand, never signed a Form 17, but instead had his\r\nbenefits unilaterally terminated on the grounds that he had \"returned to work at\r\nleast 15 days and no temporary partial compensation [wa]s due.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Regulation 67-504 was amended in 1997, under the prior and amended\r\nversion, Hutchinson's firing of Cranford after the fifteen-day window would still\r\nrequire Hutchinson to pay temporary disability unless: (1) a physician determines\r\nCranford is able to \"return to work without restriction\";4 or (2) a physician\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Hutchinson terminated Cranford on August 31, 2007, seventeen days after\r\nreturning to work, for being unsafe on the job site. Cranford testified Hutchinson\r\nfired him because \"he was getting worried [about] me getting hurt in another\r\naccident, getting killed or dying of a heart attack.\" While Cranford argues in his\r\nbrief that Hutchinson's motivation for firing him was pretextual, the propriety of\r\nhis firing is not before this court.\r\n4Pursuant to 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-502(D) (Supp. 2011), \"return to work\r\nwithout restriction\" is defined as follows:\r\n             A statement of the authorized health care provider about\r\n             the capacity of the claimant to meet the demands of a job\r\n             and the conditions of employment. The determination\r\n             must be made when the claimant's physical condition is\r\n             static or is stabilized with or without medical treatment.\r\n\ndetermines Cranford has reached maximum medical improvement such that\r\npermanent disability benefits, as opposed to temporary benefits, should be awarded\r\nif warranted. See Smith v. S.C. Dep't. of Mental Health, 335 S.C. 396, 399, 517\r\nS.E.2d 694, 695-96 (1999) (\"Clearly, if an employee has reached MMI and\r\nremains disabled, then his injury is permanent. This is precisely the reason to\r\nterminate temporary benefits in favor of permanent benefits upon a finding of\r\nMMI.\").\r\n\r\nUnder both scenarios, Cranford was not released to \"return to work without\r\nrestriction\" until June 3, 2008, the date on which Dr. Edwards opined Cranford had\r\nreached MMI and concluded Cranford could return to work \"with the use of good\r\nbody mechanics and careful lifting techniques.\" Despite Cranford's argument that\r\nthe latter caveat was tantamount to continued work restrictions, we find Dr.\r\nEdwards' express approval of returning to work and finding of no permanent\r\nimpairment equates to \"returning to work without restriction.\" Accordingly, we\r\nconclude Hutchinson was required to pay Cranford temporary disability benefits\r\nfrom the day after his termination, September 1, 2007, until he achieved MMI and\r\nwas authorized to return to work without restriction on June 3, 2008. We remand\r\nCranford's entitlement to partial and/or total temporary disability as well as the\r\ncorresponding compensation to the Appellate Panel for computation.5\r\n\r\nII.   Maximum Medical Improvement\r\n\r\nNext, Cranford claims the Appellate Panel erred in affirming the single\r\ncommissioner's finding that he had reached MMI for his back and arms,\r\nparticularly when the single commissioner failed to explicitly find Cranford\r\nreached MMI. We agree in part.\r\n\r\n            The determination is appropriate when there are no\r\n            physical limitations on the claimant's ability to perform\r\n            the same or other suitable job as the claimant performed\r\n            before the injury.\r\n5Cranford also argues the Appellate Panel erred in failing to award him temporary\r\nbenefits because Hutchinson failed to properly commence and terminate Cranford's\r\nbenefits. Because we reverse and remand his entitlement to temporary\r\ncompensation based on the foregoing, we decline to address this argument. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address an issue when a\r\ndecision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\n\"Maximum medical improvement is a term used to indicate that a person has\r\nreached such a plateau that in the physician's opinion there is no further medical\r\ncare or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.\" O'Banner v.\r\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\n\"MMI is a factual determination left to the discretion of the [Appellate] [P]anel.\"\r\nGadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 224, 628 S.E.2d 262, 268 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nRegarding Cranford's back, the single commissioner did not make any explicit\r\nfindings about whether Cranford achieved MMI. However, the single\r\ncommissioner agreed with Dr. Edwards' 0% impairment rating and concluded that\r\nCranford had a 0% disability to his back. Additionally, the single commissioner\r\nconcluded as a matter of law that based on Dr. Edwards' testimony, \"no further\r\nmedical treatment will lessen [Cranford's] period of disability.\" In making these\r\nconclusions, the single commissioner, and ultimately the Appellate Panel,\r\nimplicitly held that Cranford had achieved MMI for his back. See O'Banner, 319\r\nS.C. at 28, 459 S.E.2d at 327 (\"Maximum medical improvement is a term used to\r\nindicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physician's opinion\r\nthere is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of\r\nimpairment.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is substantial evidence in the record to conclude Cranford\r\nattained MMI no later than June 3, 2008. Specifically, Cranford was able to\r\nmaintain two jobs after his injury, the first of which involved routine stooping,\r\nbending over, and lifting. Despite Cranford's testimony that he was limited in the\r\ntasks he could undertake, he also testified on the date of the hearing he was\r\nphysically capable of working \"full time at medium to light duty.\" In addition,\r\nCranford did not seek medical treatment for almost six months after his injury.\r\nWhen Cranford eventually sought medical treatment, he was instructed by Doctor's\r\nCare to follow up in one week, yet Cranford failed to return for another ten weeks.\r\nWhen Cranford did return, the X-Rays of his back were normal.\r\n\r\nBecause Cranford claimed continued back pain, Doctor's Care referred him to Dr.\r\nEdwards. After an MRI scan, Dr. Edwards noted a minimal disc protrusion at his\r\nL5-S1 disc, but he noted it did not likely have any clinical significance. Dr.\r\nEdwards also concluded Cranford had attained MMI and stated returning to work\r\nwas acceptable with \"the use of good body mechanics and careful lifting\r\ntechniques.\" Cranford claims Dr. Edwards' caveat and prescription of Flexeril for\r\nhis muscle spasms is evidence that Cranford has not reached MMI. To the\r\ncontrary, Dr. Edwards' report coupled with the thirty-day prescription of Flexeril\r\n\nconstitutes evidence from which the single commissioner could conclude the\r\nmedication would help to temporarily alleviate Cranford's remaining symptoms,\r\nbut his medical condition would not further improve. See O'Banner, 319 S.C. at\r\n28, 459 S.E.2d at 327 (disagreeing with claimant's assertion that doctor's\r\nprescription of medication after discharge was evidence claimant had not reached\r\nMMI because substantial evidence in record existed to show that medication\r\nhelped to temporarily alleviate claimant's remaining symptoms despite the fact that\r\nhis medical condition would not further improve).\r\n\r\nAs to Cranford's arms, the single commissioner never made a finding of MMI to\r\nhis arms. The single commissioner's only finding pertaining to Cranford's arms\r\nwas an award for disfigurement for his keloid scars in the amount of four weeks of\r\ncompensation for his left arm and eight weeks of compensation for his right arm.\r\nWe note a disfigurement award is generally not proper prior to a finding of MMI.\r\nSee Halks, 208 S.C. at 48, 36 S.E.2d at 855-56 (reversing award for disfigurement\r\nwhen claimant was receiving temporary total disability benefits because receipt of\r\ntemporary disability established he had not attained MMI, which was a prerequisite\r\nfor permanent disfigurement award). However, both parties stipulated to this\r\naward, and Cranford does not appeal the propriety of the disfigurement award.\r\nRegardless, the issue of disfigurement is separate from the issue of permanent\r\ndisability in the instant case.6 As such, an explicit finding for MMI is still\r\nnecessary because it is also relevant to Cranford's entitlement to permanent\r\ndisability. Thus, we remand for specific findings on this issue.\r\n\r\nIII.   Permanent Disability Benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n6 An employee may be entitled to both a disability and a disfigurement award when\r\nan injury is in the form of a keloid scar. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-30(23) (Supp.\r\n2011) (\"[P]roper and equitable benefits must be paid for serious permanent\r\ndisfigurement of the face, head, neck, or other area normally exposed in\r\nemployment, not to exceed fifty weeks. Where benefits are paid or payable for\r\ninjury to or loss of a particular member or organ under other provisions of this title,\r\nadditional benefits must not be paid under this item, except that disfigurement also\r\nincludes compensation for serious burn scars or keloid scars on the body resulting\r\nfrom injuries, in addition to any other compensation.\") (emphasis added); see\r\ngenerally Mason v. Woodside Mills, 225 S.C. 15, 21, 80 S.E.2d 344, 347-48 (1954)\r\n(finding employee was entitled to disability and disfigurement for work-related\r\naccident that caused not only loss of use to his arm but significant atrophy to his\r\narm resulting in disfigurement).\r\n\nNext, Cranford contends the Appellate Panel erred in failing to award him\r\npermanent partial disability benefits based on the injuries to his back, arms, and\r\nskin. We agree in part.\r\n\r\nIn the single commissioner's order, he concluded Cranford did not sustain any\r\npermanent partial disability to his back under section 42-9-30. In making this\r\nconclusion, the single commissioner considered Cranford's six-month delay in\r\nseeking medical treatment from Doctor's Care in addition to his failure to follow-\r\nup with Doctor's Care for ten weeks, despite instructions to return within one week\r\nof his initial visit.\r\n\r\nFurther, Dr. Edwards' medical opinion supports the single commissioner's and the\r\nAppellate Panel's conclusion. After being referred to Dr. Edwards, Cranford\r\nunderwent an MRI, which revealed no evidence of a fracture. Dr. Edwards found a\r\nminimal disc protrusion at L5-S1, but he concluded it was likely of no clinical\r\nsignificance. Dr. Edwards noted Cranford sustained a lumbar sprain and\r\naccordingly prescribed him one month of Flexeril to temporarily alleviate his\r\ndiscomfort. In approving the occasional use of Flexeril for a limited period of\r\ntime, he concluded Cranford was capable of returning to work with \"the use of\r\ngood body mechanics and careful lifting techniques.\" The single commissioner\r\nacknowledged Cranford's visit to Dr. Zgleszewski. Hutchinson claims the\r\nAppellate Panel afforded less weight to Dr. Zgleszewski's medical reports based on\r\nthe timing of Cranford's visits and the fact that his visits were at the behest of\r\nCranford's attorney. The nature and timing of Cranford's visits do not discredit Dr.\r\nZgleszewski's medical opinion. We find both parties presented credible conflicting\r\nmedical evidence. The single commissioner, and ultimately the Appellate Panel,\r\nhad the discretion to weigh the conflicting evidence in rendering its decision.\r\nThus, we defer to its findings on this issue. See Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores,\r\nInc., 318 S.C. 431, 435, 458 S.E.2d 76, 78 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"Where the medical\r\nevidence conflicts, the findings of fact of the [Appellate Panel] are conclusive.\").\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner, however, failed to make any conclusions on whether\r\nCranford sustained permanent disabilities to his skin or arms. Without specific\r\nfindings regarding whether Cranford suffered a permanent impairment to his arms\r\nand skin, we remand this issue to the Appellate Panel to make specific findings on\r\nCranford's impairment to his arms and skin based on the evidence, and\r\nconsequently, his entitlement to permanent partial disability benefits. See Baldwin\r\nv. James River Corp., 304 S.C. 485, 486, 405 S.E.2d 421, 422 (Ct. App. 1991)\r\n(finding that without specific and definite findings upon the evidence, this court\r\ncould not review the Appellate Panel's decision that a claimant sustained neither an\r\n\ninjury to his back nor a permanent disability to his right arm, particularly when\r\nthose were material facts in issue).\r\n\r\nIV.   Additional Medical Treatment\r\n\r\nFinally, Cranford contends the Appellate Panel erred in affirming the single\r\ncommissioner's finding that he was not entitled to additional medical treatment for\r\nhis back. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-15-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) provides for\r\n\"[m]edical, surgical, hospital and other treatment, including medical and surgical\r\nsupplies as may reasonably be required, for a period not exceeding ten weeks from\r\nthe date of an injury to effect a cure or give relief and for such additional time as in\r\nthe judgment of the Appellate Panel will tend to lessen the period of disability . . .\r\n.\" Pursuant to this section, an employer may be liable for a claimant's future\r\nmedical treatment if it tends to lessen the claimant's period of disability even if the\r\nclaimant has returned to work and has reached maximum medical improvement.\r\nDodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 583, 514 S.E.2d 593, 598\r\n(Ct. App. 1999); see also Scruggs v. Tuscarora Yarns, Inc., 294 S.C. 47, 50, 362\r\nS.E.2d 319, 321 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding substantial evidence supported a finding\r\nof maximum medical improvement despite the claimant continuing to receive\r\nphysical therapy); O'Banner, 319 S.C. at 28, 459 S.E.2d at 327 (finding claimant's\r\nreceipt of prescriptive medicines after he had reached maximum medical\r\nimprovement constituted substantial evidence from which the single commissioner\r\ncould conclude the medication helped to temporarily alleviate the claimant's\r\nremaining symptoms, but his medical condition would not further improve).\r\n\r\nThe relevant inquiry is not whether Cranford attained MMI for his back, but\r\nwhether additional medical treatment and medication will tend to lessen his period\r\nof disability. See generally Dodge, 334 S.C. at 581, 514 S.E.2d at 596 (finding\r\nwhether employee reached MMI was irrelevant to entitlement to permanent\r\ndisability benefits because \"'[m]aximum medical improvement' is a distinctly\r\ndifferent concept from 'disability.'\"). Again, because the medical evidence is\r\nconflicting on this issue, we must defer to the Appellate Panel. See Tiller v. Nat'l\r\nHealth Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999)\r\n(\"Where there is a conflict in the evidence, either by different witnesses or in the\r\ntestimony of the same witness, the findings of fact of the Commission are\r\nconclusive.\"). In Dr. Edwards' June 3, 2008 report, he diagnosed Cranford with a\r\nlumbar strain/sprain, but he concluded it was acceptable for Cranford to take an\r\noccasional Flexeril for muscle spasms and wrote Cranford a thirty-day prescription\r\n\nfor Flexeril. Because Dr. Edwards opined Cranford suffered no permanent\r\nimpairment, the single commissioner concluded Cranford sustained a 0% disability\r\nto his back. Although Dr. Zgleszewski documented muscle spasms on July 22,\r\n2008 and on April 23, 2009, and opined that additional treatment would alleviate\r\nCranford's pain, numbness, and spasms in his back, the Appellate Panel afforded\r\nmore weight to Dr. Edwards' testimony in determining further medical treatment\r\nwould not lessen Cranford's period of disability. See id. at 340, 513 S.E.2d at 846.\r\n(\"Expert medical testimony is designed to aid the Commission in coming to the\r\ncorrect conclusion; therefore, the Commission determines the weight and credit to\r\nbe given to the expert testimony.\"). Accordingly, we affirm the Appellate Panel on\r\nthis issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the Appellate Panel's decision to deny Cranford\r\ntemporary disability benefits and remand for a determination of the amount of\r\ntemporary compensation due to Cranford from the day after his termination,\r\nSeptember 1, 2007, until he achieved MMI and was authorized to return to work\r\nwithout restriction on June 3, 2008. We affirm the finding of MMI to Cranford's\r\nback but remand the issue of MMI for Cranford's arms to the Appellate Panel\r\nbased on its failure to rule on this issue. We affirm the Appellate Panel's\r\nconclusion that Cranford is not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits for\r\nhis back but remand the issue of permanent disability for his arms and skin to the\r\nAppellate Panel based on the single commissioner's and Appellate Panel's failure\r\nto rule on these issues. Lastly, we affirm the Appellate Panel's conclusion that\r\nCranford was not entitled to additional medical treatment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Appellate Panel's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4985","title":"Boyd v.

We affirm.\r\n\n                      FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nSelectQuote is an insurance broker that offers consumer quotes and comparison\r\ninformation from more than a dozen insurance carriers.1 On August 19, 2007,\r\nSelectQuote sent Boyd a solicitation to replace his existing Mutual of Omaha life\r\ninsurance policy. Thereafter, Boyd learned his monthly premium with Mutual of\r\nOmaha would increase from $336.42 to $1,301.63 on November 18, 2007.\r\n\r\nOn November 14, 2007, Boyd contacted SelectQuote to inquire about the\r\ninsurance rates listed in its solicitation. Boyd spoke with SelectQuote Account\r\nManager Elizabeth Grissom, who conducted a phone interview, wherein she\r\nobtained Boyd's medical history. During the phone interview, Boyd told Grissom\r\nthat he was in excellent health; however, he admitted he was a smoker, and Boyd\r\nacknowledged he would be getting the smoker's rate. Based on the information\r\nBoyd provided, Grissom compared premium quotes from multiple insurance\r\ncompanies; Liberty Life offered the lowest premium quote at a rate of $406.17 a\r\nmonth. Boyd verbally accepted the Liberty Life premium rate, subject to a medical\r\nexamination and underwriting approval.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated November 15, 2007, SelectQuote confirmed the $406.17 monthly\r\npremium quoted by Grissom. The letter identified Boyd's underwriting\r\nclassification as \"Preferred Tobacco.\"2 Further, the letter explained \"[i]f [the]\r\nmonthly plan is selected [Liberty Life] will set up an automatic payment plan.\"\r\nAdditionally, SelectQuote emailed Boyd a checklist to help him complete Liberty\r\nLife's insurance application, which instructed him (1) to select automatic bank\r\ndraft as the form of payment; (2) to complete the premium authorization card; and\r\n(3) to provide a voided check imprinted with his name and address.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2007, Boyd submitted to a medical exam. He gave the\r\ncompleted life insurance application to the nurse performing the medical exam on\r\nbehalf of Liberty Life. The completed application included Boyd's authorization to\r\ndraft his checking account and a copy of a blank, voided check.\r\n\r\nDue to blood pressure problems revealed in Boyd's medical records, Liberty Life\r\napproved Boyd's application for the underwriting classification, \"Smoker Non-\r\nPreferred.\" On January 11, 2008, Grissom informed Boyd that Liberty Life had\r\n\r\n1 SelectQuote is not an insurance company or licensed to issue contracts of \n\r\ninsurance in South Carolina or elsewhere. \n\r\n2 \"Preferred Tobacco\" refers to a smoker in excellent health. \n\r\n\napproved his application at an adjusted premium rate of $417.73. Boyd verbally\r\naccepted the adjusted quote. He then asked Grissom if the policy with Liberty Life\r\nwas effective as of that day. She responded: \"[O]nce I hit the offer button, it goes\r\ninto issue status. You are issued, you are done . . . .\" After this representation,\r\nBoyd asked Grissom to fax him a letter \"indicating that this policy with Liberty is\r\neffective upon my acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 2008, Grissom sent a fax to Boyd stating his application for life\r\ninsurance had been \"approved\" by Liberty Life and the policy \"will be issued and\r\nforwarded to you soon.\" On January 15, 2008, Boyd called Grissom and explained\r\nthat the language in the fax did not give him the satisfaction necessary for him to\r\ncancel his existing policy. Thereafter, Grissom assured Boyd he had \"double\r\ncoverage\" until he cancelled his policy with Mutual of Omaha. However, Grissom\r\nadvised him to wait to cancel the Mutual of Omaha policy until he had physically\r\nreceived the Liberty Life policy.\r\n\r\nDuring the January 15, 2008 phone call, Boyd asked Grissom when the first\r\npremium would be drafted from his bank account. Grissom replied: \"[O]nce we've\r\nsubmitted it, it really is dependent upon the bank.\" Boyd expressed his hesitancy\r\nto cancel the Mutual of Omaha policy explaining, \"I know that no insurance is in\r\neffect until [the] premium has been paid[.]\" Boyd further noted: \"[I]t's not a\r\nbinding contract until money is exchanged . . . but once they receive a check in\r\ntheir hands and it's credited, then - - then it's in force, not before.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 30, 2008, Boyd informed SelectQuote that he had not\r\nyet received the policy from Liberty Life. Subsequently, SelectQuote investigated\r\nthe matter and determined that Grissom, through a clerical error, had quoted Boyd\r\nthe incorrect premium amount. When calculating Boyd's adjusted premium in the\r\ncomputer system, Grissom inadvertently had selected \"Non-Tobacco\" from the\r\npull-down menu instead of \"Tobacco.\" As a result, she had calculated the monthly\r\npremium based on the underwriting class \"Non-Smoker/Non-Preferred Table B\" in\r\nthe amount of $417.73, instead of \"Smoker/Non-Preferred Table B\" in the amount\r\nof $1,037.90.3\r\n\r\n\r\n3The quote history can be summarized as follows:\r\n     Date                Amount/Month       Risk/Classification/Table\r\n1.   Nov. 14, 2007       $    406.17        Smoker/Preferred (excellent health)\r\n2.   Jan. 11, 2008       $    417.73        Non-Smoker/Non-Preferred/Table 2\r\n3.   Jan. 30, 2008       $ 1,037.90         Smoker/Non-Preferred/Table 2\r\n\nThat afternoon, Sales Supervisor Chris Smith of SelectQuote called Boyd and\r\ninformed him of the clerical error. Smith quoted Boyd the correct monthly\r\npremium rate of $1,037.90. Boyd responded, \"this is absolutely totally\r\nunacceptable.\" He further stated: \"I am not going to pay 13 or $1,400 a month\r\nwith Liberty Mutual.\" Boyd informed Smith that he would take this issue to his\r\nlawyer and instructed Smith, \"you are not going to do anything without me talking\r\nto my lawyer.\" On May 16, 2008, Boyd accepted a ten-year, $500,000 term-life\r\ninsurance policy from Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company with a\r\nmonthly premium of $916.13.\r\n\r\nBoyd commenced this action on November 26, 2008, alleging breach of contract,\r\nbad faith refusal to pay benefits, and negligent misrepresentation. Boyd sought\r\ndamages and attorney's fees. Liberty Life and SelectQuote filed a counterclaim\r\nseeking a declaratory judgment to determine whether a contractual relationship\r\nexisted between Boyd and Liberty Life. All parties filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment. The parties agreed that no genuine issue of material fact was\r\nin dispute and asked the judge to decide the issue as a matter of law. Both cross-\r\nmotions for summary judgment were heard on June 3, 2010. On June 17, 2010, the\r\ncircuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty Life and SelectQuote,\r\nfinding that no valuable consideration existed between Boyd and Liberty Life\r\nbecause Boyd had not paid the insurance premium. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment, an appellate\r\ncourt applies the same standard of review applied by the trial court. Russell v.\r\nWachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 332 (2003). When an\r\nappeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to review\r\nwhether the trial court properly applied the law to those facts. In re Estate of\r\nBoynton, 355 S.C. 299, 301, 584 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 2003); WDW Props. v.\r\nCity of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000). In such cases, the\r\nappellate court owes no particular deference to the trial court's legal conclusions.\r\nBoynton, 355 S.C. at 301-02, 584 S.E.2d at 155; J.K. Constr., Inc. v. W. Carolina\r\nReg'l Sewer Auth., 336 S.C. 162, 166, 519 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1999).\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue Boyd raises on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in finding no\r\nvaluable consideration existed to form a contract for life insurance because he had\r\nnot paid the insurance premium. Boyd contends the tender of a voided check and\r\n\nwritten authorization to draft his checking account constituted sufficient\r\nconsideration to form a contract for life insurance. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Valuable consideration for a contract may consist of some forbearance given or\r\ndetriment suffered.\" Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 304, 468\r\nS.E.2d 292, 300 (1996) (citation omitted). A \"premium\" is defined as \"payment\r\ngiven in consideration of a contract of insurance.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 38-1-20(46)\r\n(Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). \"Laypersons who pay their premium at the time\r\nan application for insurance is filed are justified in assuming that payment will\r\nbring immediate protection.\" Poston v. Nat'l Fid. Life Ins. Co., 303 S.C. 182, 186,\r\n399 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1990); see also Crossley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n307 S.C. 354, 357, 415 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1992).\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, in the absence of an express or implied agreement to the\r\ncontrary, a check does not constitute payment unless it produces payment in cash,\r\nthe presumption being that the check is accepted on condition that it be paid.\"\r\nBurns v. Prudence Life Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 515, 520, 134 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1964)\r\n(citations omitted); see also Elliott v. Snyder, 246 S.C. 186, 190, 143 S.E.2d 374,\r\n375 (1965) (stating when a check is an accepted method of payment, \"the giving of\r\na check is not, in the absence of an express or implied agreement to that effect, a\r\npayment in discharge of the debt\"); Holladay v. S.C. Power Co., 169 S.C. 241,\r\n243, 168 S.E. 691, 691 (1933) (\"This court has repeatedly, and recently, held that a\r\ncheck does not constitute payment, unless it produces payment in cash.\"). \"The\r\nforegoing principles are equally applicable to the payment of insurance premiums,\r\nand ordinarily the taking of a check for an insurance premium is conditional upon\r\npayment of the check upon presentation.\" Burns, 243 S.C. at 520, 134 S.E.2d at\r\n771; see also McCormick v. State Capital Life Ins. Co., 253 S.C. 544, 550, 172\r\nS.E.2d 308, 311 (1970) (holding insurance policy was \"never of any force or effect\r\nand afforded the applicant no coverage\" because check given for payment of first\r\nmonthly premium was never paid). \"In the usual instance, acceptance of a check\r\nby the insurer is considered to be conditional only, and the burden rests on the\r\ninsured to see that the check is honored when presented.\" Burns, 243 S.C at 520-\r\n21, 134 S.E.2d at 771.\r\n\r\n             The effect of this rule is that if the check is paid when\r\n             presented, the payment generally relates back to the time\r\n             when the check was delivered to the payee, thereby\r\n             benefitting the drawer, by preventing the payee (here the\r\n             insurer) from being able to hold the check without\r\n             depositing or cashing it for an unreasonable time-beyond\r\n\n             the due date for the payment of the premium, for\r\n             instance-and then asserting that the payment was late and\r\n             that, therefore, the policy lapsed.\r\n\r\n16 Williston on Contracts § 49:76 (4th ed. 2010).\r\n\r\nBoyd selected to pay the insurance premium on a monthly basis; therefore, he was\r\nrequired to pay by automatic bank draft. Boyd submitted a voided check and\r\nauthorization to draft his checking account in compliance with the insurance\r\napplication's instructions. Thereafter, Liberty Life approved Boyd's insurance\r\napplication. However, the record contains no evidence that Liberty Life's approval\r\nof Boyd's insurance application constituted an agreement by Liberty Life to accept\r\nthe tender of the voided check and authorization to draft his checking account as\r\nabsolute payment of the premium. See Burns, 243 S.C. at 520, 134 S.E.2d at 771\r\n(\"[I]n the absence of an express or implied agreement to the contrary, a check does\r\nnot constitute payment unless it produces payment in cash.\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, Boyd submitted the voided check and bank draft authorization as a part\r\nof the application process two months before the premium amount was finalized.\r\nAs a result, neither the voided check nor the authorization to draft Boyd's checking\r\naccount specified the amount of the premium. See Going v. Mutual Benefit Life\r\nIns. Co., 58 S.C. 201, 209, 36 S.E. 556, 558 (1900) (holding an insurance policy\r\nrequiring payment of the first premium during the lifetime of the insured was\r\neffective upon tender of the amount of the premium); see also Burns, 243 S.C. at\r\n520, 134 S.E.2d at 771 (\"The mere giving or sending of a worthless check to the\r\ninsurer does not effect the payment of a premium.\" (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted)). Furthermore, when SelectQuote informed Boyd of the correct adjusted\r\npremium quote of $1,037.90, Boyd refused to pay that amount.4 Accordingly, we\r\n\r\n4 Boyd also argues Grissom's misquote of $417.73 is binding on Liberty Life\r\nbecause SelectQuote acted as an agent for Liberty Life by communicating the\r\namount of the premium. We find this argument is without merit. Communicating\r\na premium amount to the prospective insured does not convert an insurance broker\r\ninto an insurance agent. See S.C. Code Ann. § 38-43-10(5) (Supp. 2011) (defining\r\nan insurance agent as a person who \"receives, collects, or transmits any premium\r\nof insurance\"). Additionally, Liberty Life did not approve Boyd for the \"Non-\r\nSmoker\" rate of $417.73 mistakenly quoted by Grissom. See Hiott v. Guaranty\r\nNat'l Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 522, 530, 496 S.E.2d 417, 422 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating an\r\ninsurance broker cannot be converted into an agent of the insurer \"without\r\nevidence creating an inference that he was acting at the 'instance or request' of the\r\n\nfind Boyd's submission of a blank, voided check and authorization to draft his\r\nchecking account pursuant to the application instructions merely established a\r\nmethod of payment, i.e., automatic bank draft, but was not the actual payment\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, Liberty Life neither accepted nor drafted any funds from Boyd's\r\nchecking account as payment of the premium. Even though Boyd authorized\r\nLiberty Life to draft the premium amounts from his checking account, he was still\r\nobligated to pay the premium to establish sufficient consideration for an insurance\r\ncontract. See Burns, 243 S.C. at 520, 134 S.E.2d at 771. \"The fact that the insured\r\nauthorizes his or her bank to deduct the amount of the premium from his or her\r\naccount does not satisfy the insured's obligations where no payment was actually\r\nmade by the bank to the insurer.\" 5 Holmes' Appleman on Insurance § 24.2 (2d ed.\r\n1998); see also Haupt v. Midland Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 567 So. 2d 319, 1321 (Ala.\r\n1990) (holding appellant's choice of the automatic withdrawal method of payment\r\ndid not relieve him of his duty to pay the premium). Because Boyd did not\r\nactually pay the premium, we hold there was not sufficient consideration to form a\r\ncontract for life insurance between Boyd and Liberty Life.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany\" (citing Allstate Ins.

As a\r\nresult, Purchasers executed a Personal Credit Application Form and requested\r\ncredit of $5,000 for the purpose of buying bricks, mortar, and sand from Seller.\r\n\r\nSeller's Personal Credit Application Form stated that if Seller approved Purchasers'\r\nCredit Application, Seller retained \"the right not to extend credit to Purchaser at\r\nany time, particularly if the account is not paid in full each month.\" Regarding\r\nPurchasers' payment obligations and Seller's collection rights upon Purchasers'\r\ndefault, the Credit Application specified that [1] payment was due in full within\r\nthirty days of Seller's invoice; [2] should payment in full not be made within thirty\r\ndays, the account would be in default and would accrue finance charges; and [3] if\r\nSeller was required to exercise collection efforts, Purchasers were responsible for\r\npaying all of Seller's attorney's fees, costs, and expenses. The Credit Application\r\nstated:      [1] Purchaser hereby agrees and promises to pay [Seller]\r\n             for all services and materials purchased from [Seller],\r\n             now or in the future, on this account. Purchaser\r\n             understands that payments are due in full within thirty\r\n             (30) days of the date of [Seller's] invoice. [2] Should\r\n             payments not be made within thirty (30) days, the\r\n             account will be considered past-due and in default, and\r\n             shall accrue finance charges of 18% per annum from the\r\n             first day the account is past due, until payment is made in\r\n             full. Purchaser agrees to pay these finance charges. [3]\r\n             Purchaser also agrees to pay all [Seller's] attorney[']s\r\n             fees, costs[,] and expenses. Each of the undersigned\r\n             [Purchasers] agrees to pay court costs, and all other costs\r\n             of collection allowed by law.\r\n\r\nPurchasers also signed a \"Guaranty Agreement,\" in which they agreed: \"In the\r\nevent this account is placed in the hands of an attorney or attorneys for collection\r\nor suit instituted to collect some or any portion thereof, I, and/or we agree and\r\npromise to pay all [Seller's] attorneys' fees, costs[,] and expenses.\"\r\n\r\nSeller approved Purchasers' Credit Application and extended a $5,000 \"line of\r\ncredit\" to Purchasers. From August 2005 through February 2006, Seller delivered\r\nbricks, sand, and mortar to Purchasers' construction site. Seller sent Purchasers an\r\n\ninvoice following each delivery; however, Purchasers failed to make payment. On\r\nFebruary 25, 2006, Seller sent Purchasers an invoice showing a balance due of\r\n$23,780.80, of which $13,685.09 was more than ninety days past due. Purchasers\r\ntold Seller that they would pay their account in full at closing.\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 2006, Purchasers closed on the loan for their new home; however,\r\nthey made no payment to Seller. Moreover, Purchasers attested on their title\r\ninsurance application: \"There are no unpaid bills or claims for labor or services\r\nperformed or material furnished or delivered during the last twelve months for\r\nalterations, repair work, or new construction on the above-described property.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 2007, Seller filed an action seeking payment of Purchasers'\r\naccount, plus interest, attorney's fees, costs, and expenses. In June 2010, following\r\na four-day trial, the jury awarded Seller actual damages of $49,856.46, which\r\nincluded the balance due on Purchasers' account and finance charges. Seller then\r\nmoved for attorney's fees, costs, and expenses, pursuant to the terms of Purchasers'\r\nCredit Application. Seller additionally filed an affidavit of attorney's fees,\r\nexpenses, and costs. Purchasers moved for a directed verdict on the issue of\r\nattorney's fees, claiming their agreement with Seller established a consumer credit\r\nsale, pursuant to section 37-2-104 of the South Carolina Code (2002). As a result,\r\nPurchasers contended the attorney's fees provisions of the Credit Application and\r\nGuaranty Agreement were void ab initio, pursuant to section 37-2-413(1) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2002), which limits attorney's fees with respect to consumer\r\ncredit sales and consumer leases.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 2010, the circuit court issued an order denying Purchasers'\r\nmotion for a directed verdict and awarded Seller attorney's fees of $51,560, and\r\nexpenses and costs of $8,295.31, for a total award of $59,855.31. This appeal\r\nfollowed.                       LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFirst, Purchasers contend that each of their transactions is properly classified as a\r\n\"consumer credit sale,\" as defined in section 37-2-104 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2002). Next, because section 37-2-413(1) of the South Carolina Code (2002)\r\nlimits attorney's fees related to consumer credit sales and consumer leases,\r\nPurchasers maintain the provisions regarding attorney's fees in the Credit\r\nApplication and Guaranty Agreement were \"void ab initio.\" The circuit court\r\nconcluded that the Credit Application did not establish a consumer credit sale, and,\r\ntherefore, section 37-2-413 did not apply. We agree.\r\n\nA \"consumer credit sale\" is defined as:\r\n\r\n             [A] sale of goods, services, or an interest in land in which\r\n\r\n             (a) Credit is granted by a person who regularly engages\r\n             as a seller in credit transactions of the same kind,\r\n\r\n             (b) The buyer is a person other than an organization,\r\n\r\n             (c) The goods, services, or interest in land are purchased\r\n             primarily for a personal, family or household purpose,\r\n\r\n             (d) Either the debt is payable in installments or a credit\r\n             service charge is made, and\r\n\r\n             (e) With respect to a sale of goods or services, the\r\n             amount financed does not exceed twenty-five thousand\r\n             dollars.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 37-2-104(1) (2002).\r\n\r\n\"The court should give words their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to\r\nsubtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.\" Auto\r\nOwners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 609, 663 S.E.2d 484, 488 (2008).\r\nPurchasers' argument for establishing a consumer credit sale transaction fails with\r\nthe analysis of § 37-2-104(1)(d) — payment of debt. In a consumer credit sale,\r\n\"either the debt is payable [1] in installments or [2] a credit service charge is\r\nmade.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 37-2-104(1)(d) (2002). Seller asserts that its Credit\r\nApplication authorized neither method of debt payment. The circuit court found\r\nthat the \"credit service charge,\" as defined in section 37-2-104(1)(d), was not\r\nequivalent to the payment of finance charges precipitated by default, as required by\r\nthe Credit Application. Furthermore, because the outstanding debt was required to\r\nbe paid in full within thirty days of Seller's invoice, the circuit court found the debt\r\nwas not eligible to be paid \"in installments.\"\r\n\r\nWe compared the definition of a \"credit service charge,\" under the South Carolina\r\nConsumer Protection Code, with the express terms of the Credit Application. We\r\nagree with the circuit court's determination that the parties' transactions cannot be\r\nclassified as consumer credit sales, as contemplated by section 37-2-104 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2002). The Consumer Protection Code defines a \"credit\r\nservice charge\" as follows:\r\n\n            \"Credit service charge\" means the sum of (1) all charges\r\n            payable directly or indirectly by the buyer and imposed\r\n            directly or indirectly by the seller as an incident to the\r\n            extension of credit, including any of the following types\r\n            of charges which are applicable: time price differential,\r\n            service, carrying or other charge, however denominated,\r\n            premium or other charge for any guarantee or insurance\r\n            protecting the seller against the buyer's default or other\r\n            credit loss; and, except as otherwise provided in this\r\n            section, (2) charges incurred for investigating the\r\n            collateral or creditworthiness of the buyer or for\r\n            commissions or brokerage for obtaining the credit,\r\n            irrespective of the person to whom the charges are paid\r\n            or payable, unless the seller had no notice of the charges\r\n            when the credit was granted. The term does not include\r\n            charges as a result of default, additional charges (§ 37-\r\n            2-202), delinquency charges (§ 37-2-203), deferral\r\n            charges (§ 37-2-204), or in a consumer credit sale which\r\n            is secured in whole or in part by a first or junior lien or\r\n            real estate, charges incurred for appraising the real estate\r\n            that is collateral for the credit sale, if not paid to the\r\n            creditor or a person related to the creditor.\r\n\r\nS.C. Ann. Code § 37-2-109 (2002) (emphases added).\r\n\r\nThe applicable provision of the Credit Application states:\r\n\r\n            Purchaser hereby agrees and promises to pay [Seller] for\r\n            all services and materials purchased from [Seller], now or\r\n            in the future, on this account. Purchaser understands\r\n            that payments are due in full within thirty (30) days of the\r\n            date of [Seller's] invoice. Should payments not be made\r\n            within thirty (30) days, the account shall be considered\r\n            past due and in default, and shall accrue finance charges\r\n            of 18% per annum from the first day the account is past\r\n            due until payment is made in full.\r\n\r\n(emphases added).\r\n\r\nBased upon the comparison between the language of section 37-2-109, defining a\r\ncredit service charge, and the Credit Application, which provides for additional\r\n\ncharges upon Purchasers' default, we find that the finance charges imposed by the\r\nCredit Application do not constitute a credit service charge. In conclusion, the\r\nCredit Application did not establish a method of payment of debt that involved\r\neither installment payments or credit service charges; rather, upon Purchasers'\r\ndefault, the Credit Application provided for the accrual of finance charges. See\r\nEllis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994) (citation omitted)\r\n(\"When the language of a contract is plain and capable of legal construction, that\r\nlanguage alone determines the instrument's force and effect.\"). Here, the plain\r\nlanguage of the Credit Application and Guaranty Agreement requires Purchasers to\r\npay Seller's attorney's fees, costs, and expenses. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit\r\ncourt's determination that the parties' agreement did not meet the test of a\r\nconsumer credit sale, and Purchasers are bound by the terms of the agreements\r\nthey executed.1                    CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 On appeal, Purchasers contend \"there was no evidence that the [attorney's] fees\r\nwere incurred.\" Seller contends this issue was raised for the first time in\r\nPurchasers' brief to the Court of Appeals, and, therefore, it is not preserved for\r\nappellate review. We agree. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497\r\nS.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (citation omitted) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be\r\nraised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\nthe trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4987","title":"Carolinas Recycling Group v.

Claimant was released to\r\nfull-time work with no restrictions, effective May 5, 2001, but he still continued to\r\nexperience pain. In May 2002, Claimant was assigned a 9% lumbar spine\r\nimpairment rating by Dr. Ross Lynch of Midlands Orthopaedics. On September\r\n25, 2002, at the request of the previous insurance carrier, Claimant went to Dr.\r\nWilliam Felmly of the Moore Orthopaedic Clinic for a second opinion. Dr.\r\nFelmly's medical report indicated Claimant's pain did not occur daily, lasted for\r\napproximately ten to fifteen minutes when it did occur, did not restrict him on the\r\njob, and did not pose any other limitations. Dr. Felmly opined there was no\r\n\"evidence [] to suggest anything that would support an impairment of 8 to 10% of\r\nthe lumbar spine in this gentleman's function\" and noted Claimant reached\r\nmaximum medical improvement (MMI) from the January 2001 injury. Dr. Felmly\r\ncleared Claimant to return to regular duty work and noted he did not observe \"any\r\ngross clinical evidence\" to suggest difficulties or to require an impairment rating.\r\n\r\nClaimant sustained another, non-work related lumbar strain in October 2002 after\r\nhe stood up from a bent position (the October 2002 injury). After the October\r\n2002 injury, Claimant's lumbar spine MRI showed \"mild anterior spondylitic\r\nchanges\" at L2-3. On December 30, 2003, Dr. Leonard Forrest of the Southeastern\r\nSpine Institute performed an independent medical evaluation and assigned a\r\nminimum 15% permanent lumbar spine impairment. Dr. Forrest opined the disc\r\nbulges at L4-5 and L5-S1 were likely caused by the January 2001 injury.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 2004, Claimant sustained a second work-related injury when the truck\r\nhe was driving overturned (the June 2004 injury). Following the accident,\r\nClaimant was admitted to the Regional Medical Center where he was diagnosed\r\nwith an anterior compression fracture at L-4. As a follow-up, Claimant visited\r\nSoutheastern Spine Institute where he was treated by Dr. Steven Poletti. Dr.\r\nPoletti determined that as a result of the January 2001 accident, Claimant sustained\r\nruptured and/or bulging discs at L4-5 and L5-S1. Dr. Poletti subsequently\r\nassigned Claimant a 10% impairment rating.\r\n\nThe orders of the single commissioner and the Appellate Panel both found\r\nClaimant's June 2004 injury to his back was caused by the truck accident alone,\r\nand his preexisting condition was not aggravated by or combined with the June\r\n2004 injury to create substantially greater medical costs and disability. In a form\r\norder, the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel in full. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard\r\nfor judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel of the Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission. Fredrick v. Wellman, Inc., 385 S.C. 8, 15-16, 682\r\nS.E.2d 516, 519 (Ct. App. 2009); see Lark v. Bi–Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35,\r\n276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Under the scope of review established in the APA,\r\nthis court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the\r\nweight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse or modify the\r\nAppellate Panel's decision if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced\r\nbecause the decision is affected by an error of law or is \"clearly erroneous in view\r\nof the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.\" See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010); Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C.\r\n271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004). Our supreme court has defined\r\nsubstantial evidence as evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would\r\nallow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion the Appellate Panel reached.\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306. \"[T]he possibility of drawing two\r\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\r\nagency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\" Palmetto\r\nAlliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696\r\n(1984).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Carrier argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law by holding it is not entitled to\r\nreimbursement from the Fund. Specifically, Carrier contends the Appellate Panel's\r\ndecision is not supported by substantial evidence. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe legislative purpose of the Fund is to \"encourage the employment of disabled or\r\nhandicapped persons without penalizing an employer with greater liability if the\r\nemployee is injured because of his preexisting condition.\" Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.\r\nS.C. Second Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 516, 518, 458 S.E.2d 550, 551 (1995).\r\n\nReimbursement from the Fund is controlled by section 42-9-400 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (1985 & Supp. 2005), which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n             (a) If an employee who has a permanent physical\r\n             impairment . . . incurs a subsequent disability from injury\r\n             by accident arising out of and in the course of his\r\n             employment, resulting in compensation and medical\r\n             payments liability or either, for disability that is\r\n             substantially greater, by reason of the combined effects of\r\n             the preexisting impairment and subsequent injury or by\r\n             reason of the aggravation of the preexisting impairment,\r\n             than that which would have resulted from the subsequent\r\n             injury alone, . . . such employer or his insurance carrier\r\n             shall be reimbursed from the Second Injury Fund as\r\n             created by [S.C. Code Ann. §] 42-7-310 for\r\n             compensation and medical benefits . . . .\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n             (d) As used in this section, \"permanent physical\r\n             impairment\" means any permanent condition, whether\r\n             congenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness\r\n             as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining\r\n             employment or to obtaining reemployment if the\r\n             employee should become unemployed.1\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400 (1985 & Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel found, inter alia, (1) Claimant had a back injury and arthritis\r\nprior to his June 2004 injury, (2) Claimant's preexisting condition was a hindrance\r\nto employment, (3) the June 2004 injury did not combine with or aggravate the\r\n\r\n1 Section 42-9-400(a) was later amended to refer to a \"disability that is\r\nsubstantially greater and is caused by aggravation of the preexisting impairment\r\nthan that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone,\" and it has\r\nomitted the \"combined effects\" language. Act No. 111, Pt. II, § 3, 2007 S.C. Acts\r\n599 (emphasis added). However, this change is applicable only to injuries that\r\noccur on or after July 1, 2007, and the parties do not argue the new version applies\r\nhere.\r\n\npreexisting condition so as to increase the disability or medical costs, and (4) the\r\nCarrier failed to meet its burden of establishing all necessary elements for partial\r\nreimbursement pursuant to section 42-9-400.\r\n\r\nThe central issue is whether substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's\r\nfinding that Claimant's June 2004 injury did not combine with or aggravate his\r\npreexisting condition. We conclude the only reasonable inference to be drawn\r\nfrom the substantial evidence in the record is that Claimant's preexisting condition\r\nwas a hindrance to his employment and that he sustained a subsequent work-\r\nrelated injury that combined with or aggravated the preexisting condition to cause\r\n\"substantially greater\" disability and medical costs than would have been caused\r\nby the subsequent injury alone. Accordingly, we find the Appellate Panel's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous in view of the\r\nreliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\r\n\r\nIn deciding that the June 2004 injury did not combine with or aggravate the\r\npreexisting condition from his January 2001 injury, the Appellate Panel relied\r\nexclusively upon an evaluation by a non-treating physician who only met with the\r\nClaimant on one occasion. Dr. Felmly's September 2002 evaluation opined\r\nClaimant has a normal functioning lumbar spine and that there was no \"clinical\r\nevidence\" to support an impairment rating following Claimant's January 2001\r\ninjury. However, it is important to note Dr. Felmly never treated Claimant\r\nfollowing his October 2002 or June 2004 injury to assess his condition or opine\r\nwhether either of his two preexisting conditions combined with or exacerbated the\r\nJune 2004 injury. Moreover, the Fund failed to present any expert testimony from\r\na physician who evaluated the Claimant after his October 2002 or June 2004\r\ninjuries to discredit the overwhelming medical testimony and evidence Carrier\r\npresented to the Appellate Panel. Therefore, we find the Appellate Panel's decision\r\nis not supported by substantial evidence. See Hill v. Eagle Motor Lines, 373 S.C.\r\n422, 436, 645 S.E.2d 424, 431 (2007) (\"Substantial evidence is that evidence\r\nwhich, in considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to\r\nreach the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.\").\r\n\r\nThe record is, however, replete with expert medical testimony concluding\r\nClaimant's preexisting condition combined with or aggravated his subsequent\r\ninjury to cause \"substantially greater\" disability than would have been caused by\r\nthe June 2004 injury alone.\r\n\nCarrier presented the evaluations of several physicians who treated Claimant after\r\nthe January 2001, October 2002, and June 2004 injuries. Moreover, these\r\nevaluations were accompanied by diagnostic imaging supporting their respective\r\nmedical opinions. Carrier submitted Dr. Lynch's evaluation, which assigned a 9%\r\nimpairment rating to Claimant's back in May 2002 as a result of Claimant's January\r\n2001 injury. In addition, Carrier presented the report of Dr. Forrest who assigned a\r\nminimum 15% permanent impairment rating to Claimant's lumbar spine following\r\nhis October 2002 injury and stated Claimant's disc bulges were \"likely caused\" by\r\nthe January 2001 injury. Dr. Forrest's assessment was confirmed by a subsequent\r\nMRI, which revealed \"degenerative changes at L2-3 which, at a minimum, was\r\naggravated by that [January 21, 2001] incident.\" Finally, Carrier highlights Dr.\r\nPoletti's medical reports linking the injuries from the two work-related accidents\r\nand concluded \"that [the] compression fracture combined with the degenerative\r\npre-existing changes at the L4, L5 level made the impairment and disability from\r\nthe compression fracture worse than they would have been if he didn't have his\r\ndegenerative changes from his pre-existing back injury.\" (emphasis added).\r\nAdditionally, Dr. Poletti noted the impairment and medical costs related to the\r\nJune 2004 accident were substantially higher because of Claimant's preexisting\r\ncondition. In sum, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the substantial\r\nevidence in the record is that Carrier is entitled to partial reimbursement from the\r\nFund. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619,\r\n611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding an appellate court can reverse or\r\nmodify the Appellate Panel's decision if the decision is \"clearly erroneous in view\r\nof the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWhen the entire record is reviewed and considered, we hold the circuit court's\r\norder affirming the Appellate Panel's order finding Carrier was not entitled to\r\npartial reimbursement from the Fund was not based upon reliable, probative, and\r\nsubstantial evidence and was, therefore, clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the order\r\nof the circuit court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4989","title":"Lambries v.

We reverse.                FACTS\r\n\r\n      Lambries filed suit against the Council contending its practice of\r\namending its agenda during regularly scheduled meetings violated FOIA.\r\nThe circuit court concluded specific language in section 30-4-80 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2007) indicated no agenda was required for regularly\r\nscheduled meetings and the amendments to the agenda were made in open\r\npublic sessions in accordance with the Council's procedures so the action did\r\nnot violate FOIA.1 This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      \"Statutory interpretation is a question of law.\" Hopper v. Terry Hunt\r\nConstr., 373 S.C. 475, 479, 646 S.E.2d 162, 165 (Ct. App. 2007). This court\r\nmay decide matters of law with no particular deference to the circuit court.\r\nPressley v. REA Constr. Co., 374 S.C. 283, 287-88, 648 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2007).                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n     Lambries argues the circuit court's interpretation of section 30-4-80 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (2007) was erroneous because it undercuts the\r\npurpose of FOIA to inform the public about business to be addressed at\r\nmeetings of public bodies. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n1Lambries initially requested that certain acts of the Council be declared null\r\nand void, but he abandoned those claims and seeks only an interpretation of\r\nFOIA that will prevent the Council from amending its agenda during\r\nmeetings in the future.\r\n\n     Section 30-4-80 provides:\r\n          (a) All public bodies, except as provided in\r\n          subsections (b) and (c) of this section, must give\r\n          written public notice of their regular meetings at the\r\n          beginning of each calendar year. The notice must\r\n          include the dates, times, and places of such meetings.\r\n          Agenda, if any, for regularly scheduled meetings\r\n          must be posted on a bulletin board at the office or\r\n          meeting place of the public body at least twenty-four\r\n          hours prior to such meetings. All public bodies must\r\n          post on such bulletin board public notice for any\r\n          called, special, or rescheduled meetings. Such notice\r\n          must be posted as early as is practicable but not later\r\n          than twenty-four hours before the meeting. The\r\n          notice must include the agenda, date, time, and place\r\n          of the meeting. This requirement does not apply to\r\n          emergency meetings of public bodies.\r\n\r\n          ....\r\n\r\n          (d) Written public notice must include but need not\r\n          be limited to posting a copy of the notice at the\r\n          principal office of the public body holding the\r\n          meeting or, if no such office exists, at the building in\r\n          which the meeting is to be held.\r\n\r\n          (e) All public bodies shall notify persons or\r\n          organizations, local news media, or such other news\r\n          media as may request notification of the times, dates,\r\n          places, and agenda of all public meetings, whether\r\n          scheduled, rescheduled, or called, and the efforts\r\n          made to comply with this requirement must be noted\r\n          in the minutes of the meetings.\r\n\r\n     Section 30-4-15 of the South Carolina Code (2007) discusses the\r\npurpose of FOIA.\r\n\n            The General Assembly finds that it is vital in a\r\n            democratic society that public business be performed\r\n            in an open and public manner so that citizens shall be\r\n            advised of the performance of public officials and of\r\n            the decisions that are reached in public activity and in\r\n            the formulation of public policy. Toward this end,\r\n            provisions of this chapter must be construed so as to\r\n            make it possible for citizens, or their representatives,\r\n            to learn and report fully the activities of their public\r\n            officials at a minimum cost or delay to the persons\r\n            seeking access to public documents or meetings.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n        The circuit court determined the \"if any\" language in section 30-40-\r\n80(a) means that nothing requires Council to have an agenda for a regularly\r\nscheduled meeting. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the\r\nrequirement that agendas be posted twenty-four hours prior to a meeting.\r\nApplying such a construction, Council could circumvent the notice\r\nrequirement by simply not preparing a formal agenda and then discussing\r\nmatters on an ad hoc basis at the meeting. Such conduct would not be in\r\nkeeping with the purpose of FOIA, and we will not construe a statute in a\r\nway that defeats the legislative intent. See Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical\r\nTherapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606 (2006) (\"A statute\r\nas a whole must receive [a] practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation\r\nconsonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.\"); Kiriakides v.\r\nUnited Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366\r\n(1994) (stating courts will reject the ordinary meaning of words if accepting\r\nsuch an interpretation of a statute leads to an absurd result that would defeat\r\nthe plain legislative intention.); id. (\"If possible, the court will construe the\r\nstatute so as to escape the absurdity and carry the intention into effect.\").\r\nAdditionally, if as Council argues no agenda is required because regularly\r\nscheduled meetings are open to the public, then the publication requirement\r\nwhen there is an agenda is superfluous. Meetings with or without an agenda\r\nare equally open to the public.\r\n\n       However, if \"agenda\"2 is not viewed narrowly as only a formally\r\nprepared piece of paper but instead represents the impactful actions and\r\nbusiness the paper memorializes, the statute can be read harmoniously. Then,\r\nthe \"if any\" language simply recognizes that regularly scheduled meetings of\r\npublic bodies may occur during which no formal action or discussion is to\r\ntake place. If so, there is no agenda and no requirement for publication of a\r\nblank piece of paper.\r\n\r\n      The remainder of subsection (a) requires publication of the agenda for\r\nany called or special meeting. By implication, a called or special meeting\r\nwould only occur if an item required formal discussion or action. This\r\ninterpretation of the statute gives logical effect and meaning to each part of\r\nthe statute and is in accord with the purpose of FOIA to notify the public of\r\nthe activities of public bodies.\r\n\r\n       The remaining question is whether a published agenda for a regularly\r\nscheduled meeting can be amended during the meeting without violating\r\nFOIA. This is a close question, because no provision appears to prohibit such\r\naction. However, to allow an amendment of the agenda regarding substantive\r\npublic matters undercuts the purpose of the notice requirement in section 30-\r\n4-80. A narrow construction of FOIA may support the position that so long\r\nas regularly scheduled meetings are open to the public, they are conducted in\r\ncompliance with FOIA. However, such a construction would be inconsonant\r\nwith the agenda notice requirement for regularly scheduled meetings and\r\nwould go against the instruction that FOIA is to be liberally construed. See\r\nN.Y. Times Co. v. Spartanburg Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 374 S.C. 307, 311,\r\n649 S.E.2d 28, 30 (2007) (stating FOIA is a statute remedial in nature and\r\nmust be liberally construed to carry out the purpose mandated by the\r\nlegislature); Evening Post Publ'g Co. v. City of N. Charleston, 363 S.C. 452,\r\n457, 611 S.E.2d 496, 499 (2005) (holding FOIA exemptions are to be\r\nnarrowly construed to fulfill the purpose of FOIA to guarantee the public\r\nreasonable access to certain activities of government).\r\n\r\n        While Lambries does not argue Council's deeds have been done with\r\nill intent, permitting the amendments to the agenda during a regularly\r\n\r\n2   Agenda is not defined in FOIA.\r\n\nscheduled meeting is a practice that could be abused and violates the spirit of\r\nFOIA. A South Carolina Attorney General opinion, while not authoritative,\r\neloquently describes the ideal conduct for meeting the obligations set forth\r\nunder FOIA. Public bodies are encouraged to take all steps\r\n            necessary to comply with both the letter and the spirit\r\n            of the Act, to carry out the express purpose of\r\n            keeping the public informed about the performance\r\n            of their public officials and the conduct of public\r\n            business. If any doubt exists as to action to be taken,\r\n            the doubt should be resolved in a manner designed to\r\n            promote openness and greater notice to the public.\r\n\r\n1989 S.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 89-111, 1989 WL 406201 (October 11, 1989).\r\n\r\n       We recognize our decision may be inconvenient in some instances, but\r\nthe purpose of FOIA is best served by prohibiting public bodies governed by\r\nFOIA from amending their agendas during meetings. Therefore, the ruling of\r\nthe circuit court is\r\n\r\n      REVERSED.\r\n\r\n      GEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n      PIEPER, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n      PIEPER, J., dissenting:\r\n\r\n      I respectfully dissent. The majority opinion is well-reasoned and\r\ncompelling. However, I am reluctant to reverse the denial of temporary\r\ninjunctive relief by the trial court because the statute is completely silent as to\r\nwhether a public body can amend an agenda that is not required for a\r\nregularly scheduled meeting. \"A statute as a whole must receive practical,\r\nreasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and\r\npolicy of lawmakers.\" Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370\r\nS.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606 (2006). \"[I]t is vital in a democratic\r\n\nsociety that public business be performed in an open and public manner so\r\nthat citizens shall be advised of the performance of public officials and of the\r\ndecisions that are reached in public activity . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-15\r\n(2007). FOIA must be construed to make it possible for citizens to learn and\r\nreport fully the activities of public officials. Id. Section 30-4-80 of the South\r\nCarolina Code provides the following:\r\n\r\n            (a) All public bodies, except as provided in\r\n                subsections (b) and (c) of this section, must give\r\n                written public notice of their regular meetings at\r\n                the beginning of each calendar year. The notice\r\n                must include the dates, times, and places of such\r\n                meetings. Agenda, if any, for regularly\r\n                scheduled meetings must be posted on a bulletin\r\n                board at the office or meeting place of the public\r\n                body at least twenty-four hours prior to such\r\n                meetings. All public bodies must post on such\r\n                bulletin board public notice for any called,\r\n                special, or rescheduled meetings. Such notice\r\n                must be posted as early as is practicable but not\r\n                later than twenty-four hours before the meeting.\r\n                The notice must include the agenda, date, time,\r\n                and place of the meeting. This requirement does\r\n                not apply to emergency meetings of public\r\n                bodies.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-80 (2007).\r\n\r\n      Section 30-4-80 is completely silent as to whether an amendment to a\r\npublished agenda for a regularly scheduled meeting is permitted. What is\r\nclear is that an agenda is not required for a regularly scheduled meeting, as\r\nindicated by the \"if any\" language in the statute. See S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-\r\n80 (2007) (\"Agenda, if any, for regularly scheduled meetings . . . .\").\r\nBecause an agenda is not required for a regularly scheduled meeting, it is\r\ndifficult to conclude that the statute's silence clearly demonstrates legislative\r\nintent to prohibit a public body from amending a discretionary agenda.\r\nAdditionally, Council's amendment of the agenda did not violate FOIA's\r\n\npurpose of providing the public access to a public body's actions behind\r\nclosed doors. Council's amendment of the agenda did not infringe on\r\nLambries' ability to learn and report fully on the activities of the public\r\nofficials. While the public was not informed of the amendment to the\r\nagenda, the meeting was performed in an open and public manner, and the\r\npublic was advised of both the meeting and the decisions reached at the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, because a FOIA violation can be criminal in nature, the law\r\nshould be clear as to what is proscribed; otherwise, unintended prosecutions\r\ncould be threatened. See S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-110 (2007) (\"Any person or\r\ngroup of persons who willfully violates the provisions of this chapter shall be\r\ndeemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more\r\nthan one hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days for the\r\nfirst offense . . . .\"). Until the legislature resolves this issue, I would not\r\njudicially impose requirements that would have the effect of creating new and\r\npotentially unintended criminal liability. Furthermore, in light of the\r\nadmitted lack of legislative clarity on this issue, I would alternatively affirm\r\nthe trial court's denial of Lambries' temporary injunction, as the decision to\r\ngrant or deny an injunction is within the discretion of the trial court. See\r\nStrategic Res. Co. v. BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540, 544, 627 S.E.2d 687,\r\n689 (2006) (\"An order granting or denying an injunction is reviewed for\r\nabuse of discretion.\"). Based on the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the\r\norder of the trial court.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4990","title":"State v.

Heller appeals, asserting the trial\r\ncourt erred in (1) allowing him to be impeached with his prior drug convictions\r\npursuant to Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, because the probative value of his drug\r\nconvictions substantially outweighed their unduly prejudicial effect, (2) refusing to\r\ndeclare a mistrial where a witness made reference to Heller being on parole, and\r\n\n(3) refusing to grant an in camera hearing on the admissibility of a witness's voice\r\nidentification of Heller. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of August 25, 2006, a paramedic, responding to an\r\nunknown medical complaint at a trailer park, found Gustavo Guzman-Hernandez,\r\nknown as \"Chino,\" lying in the roadway.1 As the paramedic approached, he\r\nencountered another man, who could not communicate in English. This person\r\npointed to a trailer with an open door. The paramedic pronounced Chino dead and\r\nleft the scene to wait on law enforcement to advise that the scene was secure.\r\nAfter Officer Clark arrived and entered the trailer, he heard moaning and then\r\nfound Mary Deanna Chavis (Mary) inside the trailer.\r\n\r\nMary was grievously wounded, with multiple lacerations and evisceration of her\r\nbowel. The attack on Mary was so brutal, medical personnel did not expect her to\r\nlive. She had multiple stab wounds to her face, chest, neck, head and hands, with a\r\nlaceration to her left lower quadrant in which the muscle had been completely\r\ntransected and her intestines were protruding from her abdomen. However, after\r\nmultiple surgeries, Mary did survive her wounds. An autopsy on Chino likewise\r\nrevealed he suffered from numerous stab wounds, including four to his face,\r\ndefensive wounds to his hand, a deep wound to his left shoulder, and a fatal,\r\nslashing stab wound to the right side of his chest which penetrated his heart. The\r\npathologist opined a single-edged weapon, such as a knife, caused Chino's injuries,\r\nand stated that a pocketknife is usually used in cases such as this. He determined\r\nthe blade would likely have been three to four inches long but could have been\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe State presented the testimony of Billie Joe Risinger, known as \"Tracy,\" who\r\nwas present at Mary's trailer on the night of the stabbings. Tracy, who admitted\r\nshe was addicted to crack cocaine, stated that on August 25, 2006, she saw Mary\r\nsitting with some other friends in Mary's front yard. Tracy testified that they all\r\nhad the same addiction, and she called one of their drug suppliers, Kevin Nails,\r\nwho came over and \"served them.\" Tracy said she then left in a car with Kevin,\r\nalong with a man named Devon and the defendant, Christopher Heller, who she\r\nhad never seen before that night. Kevin \"serve[d] somebody else some drugs\" and\r\nthe group returned to Mary's trailer, where they found Mary and Chino. After\r\n\r\n1 Gustavo also had nicknames of \"Mechanic\" and \"Mechanico,\" but was primarily\r\nreferred to throughout the testimony as \"Chino.\"\r\n\nTracy engaged in sexual intercourse with Devon, Kevin and Devon left the trailer,\r\nleaving Heller with Tracy, Mary, and Chino at the trailer. The entire group\r\nsmoked some crack, and Heller began acting strangely, removing and then putting\r\nback on his shoes and shirt. Heller also attempted to follow Tracy when she tried\r\nto leave, making Tracy feel uncomfortable. Because of his behavior, Mary politely\r\ntold Heller he had to leave. Heller initially left the trailer, but then knocked on the\r\ndoor three to five minutes later. At this point, Chino left to get a phone so they\r\ncould contact Kevin to come get Heller. With only Mary and Tracy left in the\r\nhouse, they heard a knock at the door. Over trial counsel's objection, Tracy\r\nidentified the voice she heard at the time of the knocking as belonging to Heller.\r\nWhen she heard his voice, she told Mary not to open the door, but Mary told Tracy\r\nto just shut the bedroom door, as Tracy was in the bedroom at the time. Tracy\r\nheard a lot of banging and screaming, and heard Mary screaming for her life, so\r\nshe locked the door and hid under the bed. Eventually, Tracy heard Mary say that\r\nshe was dying and her \"guts [were] hanging out.\" After Tracy asked where the\r\nman was, and Mary responded that she did not know, Tracy opened the door and\r\nfled from the trailer. When she got outside, she saw Chino, face down in the street.\r\nTracy began knocking on trailer doors to obtain a phone to call for help, but then\r\nsaw Kevin ride by in his car. She flagged down Kevin and told him his \"cousin\r\nhad went crazy, and he was trying to kill everybody.\" Kevin took Tracy to another\r\nlocation, where she called her mother, who then picked up Tracy and took Tracy\r\nback to her house. The next day, law enforcement contacted Tracy about the\r\nmatter, and Tracy told them what occurred, with the exception of naming Kevin.\r\nThe following day, however, she told law enforcement about Kevin and helped\r\nidentify him. Thereafter, on August 29, Tracy helped develop a composite picture\r\nof a man's face, as well as of tattoos she observed on his body.2 On August 30, she\r\nidentified Heller in a photographic line-up.\r\n\r\nThe State additionally presented the testimony of Kevin. Kevin stated that in\r\nAugust 2006, his cousin, Heller, was staying with Kevin's family in Lexington\r\nbecause Heller was supposed to go with Kevin's mother and grandmother to\r\n\r\n2 Tracy testified she could not remember exactly where on his body she had seen\r\nthe tattoos, but she was sure there was one that said \"made man,\" and a tattoo that\r\nhad dollar signs, and she thought there may be one of an eye. One of the\r\ninvestigators testified that he viewed tattoos on Heller's body, that Heller had\r\n\"made man\" under his chest area, and on his arms he had around \"three money\r\nsigns\" and underneath that \"my eyes only,\" with the word \"eyes\" being depicted by\r\nthe drawing of an eye and an apostrophe \"s.\" Heller also acknowledged that he had\r\ntattoos of two dollar signs on his left arm and \"made man\" across his chest.\r\n\nCherokee, North Carolina for the weekend. On August 25, at around 3:00 a.m.,\r\nKevin, Heller, and Devon went to Mary's trailer, where they saw Mary, Tracy, and\r\n\"the Mechanic\" (Chino). Kevin, Devon, Tracy, Mary, and \"the Mechanic\" started\r\nsmoking drugs. Devon and Tracy went into a bedroom to engage in sexual\r\nintercourse, and after they came out, Heller and Tracy went into the bedroom. At\r\nthat time, Kevin received a phone call and needed to leave Mary's house. Devon\r\nwent with Kevin, and when Kevin called Heller to go with them, Heller became\r\nupset because he wanted to have sex with Tracy. Kevin then told Heller to just\r\nstay with Tracy, and he would return to pick up Heller. Kevin and Devon then left.\r\nSometime later, after dropping Devon off somewhere, Kevin drove back to Mary's\r\ntrailer to get Heller. When he honked his horn but got no response, he left Mary's\r\nhome, and then saw Tracy at the top of the hill. Tracy then jumped in his car\r\nstating, \"Your boy, your boy snapped.\" When Kevin asked Tracy where Heller\r\nwas, she told him that she did not know, and that Heller had left. Kevin dropped\r\nTracy off at another trailer park and then phoned his mother, who joined him to\r\ndrive around looking for Heller. When they reached Tracy's trailer and observed\r\nthe blue lights, Kevin panicked and continued driving. They tried to find Heller,\r\nbut to no avail. Later that same day, around 9:30 p.m., Kevin received a call from\r\nHeller. Kevin drove to pick up Heller, and they then met Kevin's mother at a\r\nBurger King. Kevin's mother took Heller to Lexington, and then she drove him to\r\nBaxley, Georgia the next day.\r\n\r\nMary Chavis also took the stand and testified to the circumstances surrounding the\r\nstabbings that night. According to Mary, in the early morning hours of August 25,\r\n2006, she and Chino saw Tracy riding in a car with Kevin, who Mary knew, and\r\ntwo other men, who Mary did not know. Tracy asked to go in Mary's house, so\r\nMary gave her the key. Mary told Tracy she and Chino were going to the store,\r\nand instructed her to put the key back in a flower pot. When Mary and Chino\r\nreturned to her home, the people were still in her home, which made Mary\r\nuncomfortable, so she and Chino left. When Mary and Chino returned to her home\r\nthe second time, the car the men had been riding in was no longer there, so they\r\nwalked inside and went to Mary's room and started playing cards. Mary stated\r\nthey did not see or hear anyone in the house at that time, but then heard someone\r\narguing. When Mary opened her door, she found Tracy and Heller arguing in her\r\nliving room. Mary asked what the problem was, and Heller claimed Tracy stole $7\r\nfrom him, and that \"he had put all of his stuff on the crack pipe and [Tracy]\r\nwouldn't let him have any.\" Mary asked Tracy to give Heller the pipe, but she\r\nrefused. Mary then gave Heller $20 and smoked a piece of crack with him and told\r\nHeller to leave Tracy alone, explaining she had paid Heller an extra $13 so there\r\nwould not be any trouble. While sitting in Mary's bedroom, Heller began taking\r\n\noff his shirt and shoes. When Mary asked him what he was doing and Heller did\r\nnot answer, Mary told him he needed to put his clothes on and that he would have\r\nto leave her house. Heller got dressed, but told Mary he had nowhere to go. Mary\r\ntold him to walk across the street and talk to someone over there, as the man across\r\nthe street had a phone. She then watched Heller from her window as he walked to\r\nthe home and knocked on the door. When no one answered, she observed Heller\r\nwalk back to her home. Heller knocked on her door and stated that he had\r\nnowhere to go and did not know anyone around there. At this point, Mary asked\r\nChino to let Heller use his phone to call Kevin for a ride, and Chino and Heller\r\nthen left Mary's trailer. Mary and Tracy were in Mary's bedroom, waiting for\r\nChino to return, when there was another knock at the door. Because she thought it\r\nwas Chino, Mary opened the door without looking to see who it was. Heller was\r\nstanding at the door, and when he tried to come inside, Mary put her hand on his\r\nchest and asked him, \"What is the problem? What's up?\" By the time she got\r\nthese words out, Heller said something and started stabbing her. Mary stated she\r\nfought Heller as long as she could with her hands, but then could fight no longer.\r\nShe yelled for Tracy to help her, but Tracy wanted to know who was out there, to\r\nwhich Mary responded that it was \"the same man from before.\" Mary decided to\r\nback up so she could try to kick Heller, but as she did so, he stabbed her in her\r\nstomach with the knife. The more she kicked Heller, the more her intestines would\r\ncome out, so she eventually curled up into a ball on the couch, where Heller\r\ncontinued to stab her. Eventually, Heller stopped stabbing her and ran out the\r\ndoor. Mary then got up from the couch and went to her bedroom door, begging\r\nTracy to pack her wounds before she bled to death, but Tracy would not open the\r\ndoor. Mary slid down the wall and yelled for help, but had to stop when she saw\r\nthat this action increased her bleeding. Tracy finally opened the door, and jumped\r\nover Mary and ran out the front door. At some point, both Chino and Heller came\r\nback inside the trailer. Mary testified that Heller had taken off his shirt, and he sat\r\non the couch where he had been stabbing Mary. Chino ran in the trailer and \"bent\r\nover to get the guy and something happened.\" Mary saw a movement, saw arms\r\nmove, and then saw Chino run out the door with Heller running behind him. Mary\r\nthen drifted in and out of consciousness, but remembered the police and EMS\r\narriving, whereupon she was transported to the hospital. A sketch artist visited\r\nMary in the hospital on August 28, 2006, and drew a composite of the person Mary\r\ndescribed as her attacker. On August 30, investigators also visited her in the\r\nhospital and showed her a photographic line-up, from which Mary identified\r\nHeller. Mary also made an in-court identification of Heller as the person who\r\nattacked her in her home. She testified \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\" that Heller\r\nwas her attacker.\r\n\nAfter Heller was developed as a suspect, investigators from South Carolina\r\ntraveled to Baxley, Georgia, where a search warrant was executed on the residence\r\nwhere Heller resided. Heller later turned himself in at the Appling County\r\nSheriff's Department, where he gave the South Carolina authorities a statement\r\nimplicating himself in the matter. Specifically, when asked what had occurred in\r\nColumbia, South Carolina around 4:00 a.m. on August 25, 2006, Heller stated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      My cousin Kevin Nails and another black male left the Oasis club. My\r\n      cousin stopped in the roadway to pick up and (sic) little white girl that\r\n      was walking. Kevin dropped the girl and I off at (sic) trailer. Inside\r\n      the trailer was a white lady and a Mexican man. The lady let us in.\r\n      Once inside the white girl that Kevin picked up and I went into a\r\n      bedroom and started smoking crack. I went outside for a few minutes\r\n      and when I came back inside the lady that lived there told me I had to\r\n      go. I told her I was waiting on Kevin to come back and pick me up. I\r\n      just started stabbing the people.\r\n\r\nAsked where he had obtained the knife, Heller replied, \"It was mine; it was a fold\r\nup knife. It had a brown handle. The blade was about 2 or 3 inches long.\" When\r\nasked who he started stabbing first, Heller stated, \"The lady, the man jumped on\r\nmy back inside the trailer.\" Heller further indicated, after stabbing the lady and\r\nman, he ran and found an old empty trailer and hid there until around dark. He\r\nasked a lady if he could use her phone to call someone to pick him up, and he\r\ncalled Kevin. He stayed at the lady's house until Kevin arrived, and Kevin called\r\n\"mother, Carolyn Robinson,\" who met them on the interstate. Kevin's mother took\r\nHeller to his mother's home in Georgia. Heller stated he threw the knife\r\nsomewhere after leaving the girls' trailer. He also indicated he was in Columbia\r\nfor the purpose of going to the casino in Cherokee, North Carolina with Kevin and\r\nhis aunt, Carolyn Robinson. The investigators testified they did not make any\r\npromises or threaten, coerce, or force Heller to give his statement, nor did they\r\nmake any sort of threats or promises concerning Heller's family members.\r\n\r\nOnce the investigators returned to Richland County with Heller, they drove to the\r\narea of Mary's trailer park, where Heller pointed out a small, abandoned trailer he\r\nclaimed to have stayed in between the time of the incident and going to call Kevin.\r\nHeller was also asked to show them the area where he threw the knife. The\r\ninvestigators then drove Heller to the Sheriff's Department. A few days later, one\r\nof the investigators took Heller back to the trailer park area, where Heller gave\r\n\nmore information to narrow down where he threw the knife. However, the\r\nauthorities were never able to locate the knife.\r\n\r\nHeller presented the testimony of his mother, Loranda, and himself in his defense.\r\nLoranda testified to the circumstances surrounding the execution of the search\r\nwarrant in Baxley, Georgia, and the officers taking her and Heller's friend, Jena, to\r\nthe sheriff's department. Specifically, Loranda stated that the officers pointed a\r\ngun at her; she had a heart condition that included a heart attack; they transported\r\nher and Jena to headquarters; the Appling County Sheriff read her rights to her; she\r\ninformed him she desired an attorney; she was then put inside a holding cell; and\r\nthe Sheriff told her both Georgia and South Carolina were going to charge her with\r\naiding and abetting. Loranda testified she was released after seeing her son in the\r\ncourtroom, and no one ever said anything else to her about any charges related to\r\nthis incident.\r\n\r\nHeller testified in his own defense. He acknowledged he was with Kevin and\r\nDevon on August 25, when Kevin picked up a white girl who had called him.\r\nThey then went to Mary's, where Devon went into a back room with Tracy. After\r\nthat, Heller stated he went back there with Tracy and smoked crack. Tracy started\r\narguing with him about drugs, and though Heller was not mad or hostile, \"the lady\"\r\ntold him he should leave and informed him he should go across the street to use a\r\nman's phone. Heller claims he then left without argument, but the man across the\r\nstreet would not allow him to use the phone. According to Heller, he then walked\r\nto a store and used a pay phone to call his cousin, but the call was dropped. Heller\r\nthen went to an abandoned trailer and stayed there \"until [his] high went down.\"\r\nHeller acknowledged he was drinking, smoking crack, and smoking weed that\r\nnight. Once he \"calmed down,\" some twelve to thirteen hours later, he borrowed a\r\nphone from a lady and called Kevin again. Kevin picked him up and took him to a\r\nstore where they met up with Heller's aunt. He stayed at his aunt's house that\r\nnight, and the next day she took him home to Baxley, Georgia. While in Georgia,\r\nHeller found out his mother had been taken downtown. Concerned about his\r\nmother's heart condition, he went to the local Sheriff's Department, where he was\r\ntold he was a suspect. Heller claimed the South Carolina investigators told him\r\nthey were charging his mother with aiding and abetting, and the only way they\r\nwould release her and his girlfriend was if Heller \"[took] these charges.\" Heller\r\nclaimed he signed a paper they presented to him, and the investigators then read\r\nhim his rights. One of the investigators then pulled out a laptop and started typing\r\na statement.\r\n\nHeller denied stabbing or killing anyone on the night in question. He admitted\r\ngoing to Mary's trailer with Kevin and Devon after picking up Tracy and smoking\r\ncrack with Tracy, but denied smoking crack with Mary. He acknowledged that\r\nKevin received a call and Kevin and Devon left, but he wanted to stay to have sex\r\nwith Tracy. Heller agreed that he was there at the trailer with Mary, Tracy and\r\nChino; he went into the back bedroom and smoked crack with Tracy; he argued\r\nwith Tracy; Mary told him to leave because she did not like the arguing; he went\r\nacross the street to use a phone, but the person would not let him; and he ended up\r\nstaying in an abandoned trailer all night and through the daylight hours until about\r\n9:30 p.m., when he finally saw Kevin.\r\n\r\nHeller disavowed parts of the statement he signed. Specifically, he acknowledged\r\nthe parts of the statement indicating he went to a trailer, they picked up a girl, and\r\nhe and the girl got into a little argument whereupon he was asked to leave. He also\r\ntestified he indicated in his statement that he went into a bedroom with the white\r\ngirl Kevin had picked up and they started smoking crack, and when the lady that\r\nlived there told him he had to leave, he told her he was waiting for Kevin \"to come\r\nback and pick him up.\" However, he claimed he told the investigators he did not\r\nknow anything about a knife, acknowledging only that he had a little key-chain\r\npocketknife. Heller denied stating that \"a white lady and a Mexican man\" were\r\ninside the trailer,\" that the lady let him inside, and that he \"just started stabbing\r\npeople.\" He further denied ever saying anything regarding who he stabbed first,\r\nwhat he did after stabbing the lady and the man, and what happened to the knife.\r\nHeller also testified, when they got back to South Carolina, he showed the\r\ninvestigators the abandoned trailer in which he stayed, but claimed when they\r\nasked where he threw the knife, he told them he did not know anything about a\r\nknife. He further testified that he was not given the statement to read over it until\r\nhe was back in South Carolina, and though he was read and he signed his waiver of\r\nrights, he did so because he did not have a choice.\r\n\r\nFollowing submission of the case to the jury, Heller was convicted of the murder\r\nof Chino, as well as ABWIK in regard to Mary. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.     Whether the court erred by allowing impeachment of Heller with his prior\r\ndrug convictions pursuant to rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, because the probative value of\r\nthese drug and drug dealing convictions was substantially outweighed by their\r\nunduly prejudicial effect, particularly where the solicitor admitted the nature of the\r\nconvictions made them relevant to whether the jury believed Heller that the police\r\n\nwere lying and coerced his statement, since this impermissibly invited the jury to\r\nfind Heller was acting in character in this case with his past drug convictions.\r\n\r\n2.     Whether the court erred by refusing to declare a mistrial where witness\r\nKevin Nails testified, in response to the solicitor's question about where Heller was\r\ngoing after he left South Carolina, that Heller had to get back to Georgia because\r\nhe was on \"parole leave,\" since defense counsel made a pretrial motion to exclude\r\nthis evidence, and he correctly argued a curative instruction was not going to solve\r\nthe prejudice.\r\n\r\n3.     Whether the court erred by refusing to grant defense counsel an in camera\r\nhearing on the proper foundation being laid for witness Tracy Risinger's voice\r\nidentification of Heller as the man who knocked on the door and spoke\r\nimmediately before the murder because a proper foundation for Risinger's voice\r\nidentification evidence was never established for this extraordinarily prejudicial\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Impeachment with prior drug convictions\r\n\r\nPrior to Heller taking the stand, the solicitor argued she should be allowed to\r\nimpeach Heller with five previous convictions, should Heller decide to testify. She\r\nstated Heller had a 1999 conviction for possession with intent to distribute (PWID)\r\nmarijuana, and he pled guilty to four other drug charges on the same date in 2001,\r\nincluding another PWID marijuana, two counts of \"manufacture, sell, dispense\r\ndistribute with intent to distribute\" charges, and one count of drug trafficking\r\nwithin 1,000 feet of a park, recreation facility or public housing. Trial counsel\r\nobjected, arguing under Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, these convictions were subject to a\r\nRule 403, SCRE, analysis, and because evidence showing Heller was a drug dealer\r\nwas very prejudicial and there was no probative value to the charges, the prejudice\r\noutweighed the probative value, and the State was offering these convictions\r\nstrictly as propensity evidence. The trial court denied the motion, finding the\r\nconvictions admissible.\r\n\r\nWhen Heller took the stand, he acknowledged in direct examination that he had\r\nbeen convicted of marijuana and cocaine charges and drug dealing. On cross-\r\nexamination, Heller agreed he was convicted of PWID marijuana on April 8, 1999,\r\nand the other specific drug charges of PWID marijuana, two counts of\r\nmanufacturing, selling, dispensing, and distributing with intent to distribute, and\r\n\none count of drug trafficking within 1,000 feet of a park, recreation facility, or\r\npublic housing on August 3, 2001.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Heller argues Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, allows a defendant to be\r\nimpeached with a crime punishable by a sentence in excess of one year if the court,\r\nsubject to a Rule 403, SCRE, determination,3 finds the probative value outweighs\r\nits prejudicial effect, and only if the convictions are for crimes of dishonesty or\r\nfalse statements are such prior convictions automatically admissible under Rule\r\n609(a)(2), SCRE. Heller contends the solicitor desired to impeach him with drug\r\ncrimes so the jury would believe he was acting consistently with his past character\r\nat the time of the incident. He argues violations of narcotic drug laws are\r\ngenerally not probative of truthfulness, and it is improper to admit prior criminal\r\nconvictions as impeachment evidence to show a defendant acted in conformity\r\nwith his prior record.\r\n\r\nRule 609(a), SCRE, provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,\r\n\r\n             (1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has\r\n             been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to\r\n             Rule 403, if the crime was punishable by death or\r\n             imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under\r\n             which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an\r\n             accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be\r\n             admitted if the court determines that the probative value\r\n             of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect\r\n             to the accused; and\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The State points out that a Rule 403 balancing test is applied when a conviction is\r\noffered to impeach a witness who is not the defendant, and Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE\r\nprovides its own balancing test in the case of impeaching a defendant, which is\r\nsimply that the probative value of admitting such evidence outweighs its\r\nprejudicial effect to the accused. Thus, the State contends Heller has, both at trial\r\nand on appeal, objected \"under the wrong rule.\" At any rate, the State contends the\r\ntrial court committed no error in denying Heller's motion, whether applying the\r\nRule 403, SCRE analysis, which requires evidence to be excluded if its probative\r\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice, or the\r\nappropriate standard under Rule 609(a)(1).\r\n\n             (2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a\r\n             crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false\r\n             statement, regardless of the punishment.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has approved consideration of the following five factors, along\r\nwith any other relevant factors, when weighing the probative value for\r\nimpeachment of prior convictions against the prejudice to the accused: (1) the\r\nimpeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the point in time of the conviction and\r\nthe witness's subsequent history; (3) the similarity between the past crime and the\r\ncharged crime; (4) the importance of the defendant's testimony; and (5) the\r\ncentrality of the credibility issue. State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 627, 525 S.E.2d 246,\r\n248 (2000); State v. Howard, 384 S.C. 212, 221, 682 S.E.2d 42, 47 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). This court has noted a preference for an on-the-record Colf balancing test\r\nby the trial court under Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE. See State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522,\r\n530, 556 S.E.2d 706, 710 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"While Colf involved the admission of\r\nprior convictions more than ten years old under Rule 609(b), SCRE, this court has\r\nimplicitly recognized the value of these factors in making such a determination\r\nunder Rule 609(a)(1), and urged the trial bench to not only articulate its ruling, but\r\nalso provide the basis for it, thereby clearly and easily informing the appellate\r\ncourts that a meaningful balancing of the probative value and the prejudicial effect\r\nhas taken place as required by Rule 609(a)(1).\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nMeaningful appellate review is best achieved when the trial court articulates its\r\nruling and the basis for it, when balancing the probative value of a prior conviction\r\nunder Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, against the prejudicial effect. State v. Elmore, 368\r\nS.C. 230, 239, 628 S.E.2d 271, 275 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nHere, the trial court simply denied Heller's motion to exclude the prior convictions\r\nwithout performing an on-the-record Colf analysis. However, any error in a trial\r\ncourt's failure to conduct the proper balancing test under Rule 609, SCRE, may be\r\nconsidered harmless. State v. Williams, 380 S.C. 336, 344, 669 S.E.2d 640, 644\r\n(Ct. App. 2008). In order for an appellate court to reverse a case based on\r\nerroneous admission of prior convictions, prejudice must be shown. State v.\r\nYoung, 378 S.C. 101, 107, 661 S.E.2d 387, 390 (2008). \"Generally, appellate\r\ncourts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the\r\nresult.\" State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 212, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006).\r\n\r\n             A harmless error analysis is contextual and specific to the\r\n             circumstances of the case: \"No definite rule of law\r\n             governs [a finding of harmless error]; rather the\r\n             materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be\r\n\n             determined from its relationship to the entire case. Error\r\n             is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected\r\n             the result of the trial.\"\r\n\r\nState v. Byers, 392 S.C. 438, 447-48, 710 S.E.2d 55, 60 (2011) (quoting State v.\r\nReeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990)). Further, \"[i]t is well\r\nsettled that the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely\r\ncumulative to other evidence.\" State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d\r\n611, 613 (1983).\r\n\r\nHere, Mary positively identified Heller in a photographic line-up and thereafter\r\nmade an in-court identification of Heller as the man she evicted from her home and\r\nwho then returned and stabbed both her and Chino. Additionally, Tracy picked\r\nHeller from a photographic line-up and also identified Heller in court as the man\r\nMary evicted from her home, who thereafter returned and whose voice she heard\r\nduring a knock on the door, immediately after which she heard Mary being brutally\r\nattacked. Heller's cousin, Kevin, also identified Heller as the individual he left at\r\nMary's trailer with Mary, Tracy, and Chino prior to the attack, as the person who\r\nTracy indicated to him had \"snapped\" and as the person who called him the next\r\nevening needing a ride from the area near the crime scene. Finally, Heller\r\nadmitted in his statement that he and \"a white girl\" were dropped off at a trailer by\r\nKevin, there was \"a white lady and a Mexican man\" inside the trailer, that the lady\r\nwho lived there told him he had to leave the trailer, and he started stabbing people\r\nupon his return. Thus, there was overwhelming evidence presented of Heller's\r\nguilt. Further, an abundance of evidence was presented concerning Heller's\r\nparticipation in illegal drug activity such that the admission of Heller's prior drug\r\nconvictions was cumulative to the other evidence. Tracy testified that Heller\r\naccompanied Kevin when Kevin \"served\" them drugs on the night in question, and\r\nthat Heller smoked crack with them that night. Mary also confirmed that Heller\r\nparticipated in smoking crack that night and further indicated that she paid Heller\r\nfor the drugs after Heller and Tracy argued over drugs and money. Accordingly,\r\neven if we assumed error in the admission of Heller's prior drug convictions, any\r\nsuch error was insubstantial and could not reasonably have affected the result of\r\nthe trial. Thus, Heller can show no prejudice, and any error in admission of the\r\ndrug convictions was harmless. See State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609 S.E.2d\r\n520, 524 (2005) (finding the introduction of prior convictions was not prejudicial\r\nwhere other evidence was admitted concerning defendant's possible guilt relating\r\nto other crimes, and because there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt\r\nin the matter, the introduction of his prior convictions could not have reasonably\r\naffected the outcome of the trial such that any error was harmless).\r\n\nB.    Mention of \"parole leave\"\r\n\r\nDuring Kevin's direct examination concerning Heller's whereabouts that night,\r\nKevin explained that he called his mother after he picked up Heller, they met his\r\nmother at a Burger King, and Heller got in the van with Kevin's mother to go to\r\nLexington for the night. The following colloquy then occurred:\r\n\r\n             A: I think they left like either a day - - I think a day after\r\n             she picked him up from me.\r\n             Q: Okay. They leave to go where?\r\n             A: To Baxley.\r\n             Q: Back to Baxley - -\r\n             A: Yes.\r\n             Q: - - Georgia?\r\n             A: Because he was here on like a parole leave. He had a\r\n             certain amount of time until he had to be back.\r\n\r\nAt this point, trial counsel objected and moved to strike. The trial court sustained\r\nthe objection and instructed the jury to \"[d]isregard his comment about the parole.\"\r\nThe solicitor finished examining Kevin, at which point the trial court decided to\r\ntake a fifteen minute break. After the jury left the courtroom, trial counsel asked to\r\nput a matter on the record and moved for a mistrial based upon Kevin's mention\r\nthat Heller was on parole. Counsel argued he had filed a pretrial motion so\r\nwitnesses would be instructed not to bring up Heller's parole.4 He further argued\r\nthe court's curative instruction, striking the matter from the record, was an\r\ninsufficient remedy. The court noted that the statement was \"just spontaneous\" and\r\nKevin had \"just blurted it out.\" The solicitor agreed, asserting the statement was\r\nnonresponsive to her question. The solicitor further argued \"it was a small\r\ncomment\" and the court had instructed the jury to disregard it. The trial court\r\ndenied Heller's motion for mistrial.\r\n\r\nHeller argues the mention of him being on parole clearly showed he had a prior\r\ncriminal record. He asserts that admission of evidence implying a defendant has a\r\nprior criminal record is reversible error, and the trial court's instruction to the jury\r\nto disregard the reference to parole was insufficient to cure the prejudice. Heller\r\nfurther contends this situation should not be considered one where there is a vague\r\n\r\n4No such motion is included in the record, nor does the transcript show such a\r\nmotion was ever addressed by the trial court.\r\n\nreference to a defendant's prior criminal record such that it would not justify a\r\nmistrial because, here, the solicitor knew she was going to attempt to impeach him\r\nwith his prior drug convictions at the time she argued against the mistrial motion.\r\nConsequently, it was not a vague and isolated reference. Accordingly, Heller\r\ncontends the trial court erred by refusing to declare a mistrial.\r\n\r\nWhere a defendant receives the relief requested from the trial court, there is no\r\nissue for the appellate court to decide. State v. Parris, 387 S.C. 460, 465, 692\r\nS.E.2d 207, 209 (Ct. App. 2010). \"No issue is preserved for appellate review if the\r\nobjecting party accepts the judge's ruling and does not contemporaneously make an\r\nadditional objection to the sufficiency of the curative charge or move for a\r\nmistrial.\" State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1996)\r\n(emphasis added). Although Heller subsequently moved for a mistrial, he initially\r\naccepted the trial court's ruling wherein the trial court sustained his objection and\r\ngranted his requested relief of striking the offending testimony. Because he\r\naccepted the ruling and did not contemporaneously move for a mistrial or object to\r\nthe sufficiency of the court's curative instruction, this issue is not preserved for our\r\nreview. Further, though Heller did move for a mistrial and argue the curative\r\ninstruction was insufficient immediately following conclusion of the State's direct\r\nexamination of Kevin, this is insufficient to qualify for a contemporaneous\r\nobjection. See State v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 171-72, 682 S.E.2d 19, 32-33 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009) (wherein this court found unpreserved Simmons' appellate argument\r\nthat the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial in response to\r\ntestimony of a witness referencing the robber as \"the defendant,\" where Simmons\r\nfailed to make a timely objection in response to the witness's statement, instead\r\nwaiting until after the witness finished testifying before he objected and requested\r\na mistrial).\r\n\r\nC.     In camera hearing on voice identification\r\n\r\nDuring direct examination, Tracy testified concerning the events leading up to the\r\nstabbing of Mary. Specifically, in regard to what occurred after Kevin and Devon\r\ndeparted, leaving Tracy, Mary, Chino, and Heller at the trailer, Tracy stated that\r\nthe remaining group smoked crack. According to Tracy, Heller was acting\r\nstrangely, prompting Mary to ask him to leave. Tracy stated that Heller \"gave\r\n[her] the creeps,\" and \"he tried to follow [her] out.\" Heller initially complied with\r\nMary's request and left the trailer, but returned three to five minutes later.\r\nThereafter, Chino left to get a phone, as Mary and Tracy wanted Kevin to come\r\npick up Heller. Only Tracy and Mary remained at the trailer at that time. When\r\nasked what she and Mary were doing, Tracy testified, \"Well, we were trying to sit\r\n\ndown and have a conversation, but somebody knocked on the door. It was him. I\r\nheard his voice.\" Trial counsel objected to Tracy's identification of the voice and\r\nmoved to strike the testimony, arguing her identification based on the voice had\r\nnever been addressed before and was not brought up in pretrial hearings. At this\r\npoint, a bench conference was held off the record, and the trial court thereafter\r\nsustained trial counsel's objection. When Tracy's testimony resumed before the\r\njury, the solicitor questioned her concerning her opportunity to talk with Heller and\r\nhear his voice on the night of the incident. Tracy testified that she talked with\r\nHeller \"a little\" that night; heard his voice; described it as raspy and deep; and\r\nstated she could recognize his voice if she heard it again. The following colloquy\r\nthen occurred:\r\n\r\n             Q: So that night when someone came and knocked on\r\n             the door, did the person say anything.\r\n             A: I don't know what exactly he said. I just heard - - I\r\n             just heard her saying, \"No, no,\" and I heard him say\r\n             something, and then I heard a whole lot of noise - -\r\n             Q: Like - -\r\n             A: - - like banging, like (indicating).\r\n             Q: Did the voice belong to a man or a woman?\r\n             A: A man.\r\n             Q: And could you identify that voice?\r\n             A: Yes.\r\n             Q: And who was that voice belonging to? \n\r\n             [Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. \n\r\n             [The Court]: Overruled. Go ahead. \n\r\n             A: I would say him.\r\n             Q: The defendant?\r\n             A: Uh-huh, without a doubt.\r\n\r\nWhen Tracy heard that voice, she told Mary not to open the door, but Mary told\r\nher to just shut the bedroom door. When Tracy heard banging and screaming, she\r\nthen locked the door and hid under the bed. Tracy thereafter made an in-court\r\nidentification of Heller as the man she heard come into the trailer while she was in\r\nthe bedroom. During cross-examination, trial counsel questioned Tracy\r\nextensively regarding her failure to mention anything about hearing a voice at the\r\nfront door that night in either her statement to police or in her pretrial testimony.\r\nTracy acknowledged she did not see the attack, but stated she heard it. She also\r\nnoted Mary had kicked Heller out only three minutes before the knock on the door,\r\nand questioned, \"Who else would it have been?\"\r\n\nSometime thereafter, trial counsel stated he wanted to place on the record that,\r\nduring the bench conference, he had requested an in camera hearing, in the vein of\r\na Neil v. Biggers hearing, to cross-examine Tracy on her voice identification\r\noutside the presence of the jury. The trial court acknowledged that a request had\r\nbeen made for an in camera hearing, which the court denied. The court noted it\r\nhad initially sustained the objection to the testimony, but allowed the prosecution\r\nthe opportunity to lay the foundation for Tracy's voice identification. Once the\r\nfoundation was properly laid and an objection was made, the court overruled the\r\nobjection. At the close of the State's case, trial counsel renewed his previous\r\nobjections and motions, specifically noting he had requested an in camera hearing\r\nregarding Tracy's voice identification \"[a]ccording to Neil v. Biggers.\"\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Heller argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for an\r\nin camera hearing on the admissibility of Tracy's voice identification testimony.\r\nHe asserts Tracy was improperly allowed to give this testimony because there was\r\ninsufficient foundation for it, and because South Carolina law concerning the\r\nadmission of voice identification evidence indicates a trial judge should establish\r\nsome foundation for the admissibility of such evidence. He contends Tracy's voice\r\nidentification was \"very suspect,\" noting Tracy first met Heller on the night of the\r\nincident, and she \"was in another room.\" Thus, Heller maintains the trial court\r\nshould have allowed an in camera hearing to determine if there was a proper\r\nfoundation for Tracy's voice identification. Heller additionally cites the California\r\ncase of People v. Clark, 833 P.2d 561 (1992), for the proposition that the trial court\r\nerred in failing to hold an in camera hearing on the voice identification evidence.\r\n\r\nWe find no merit to this issue. In Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972), the United\r\nStates Supreme Court addressed whether a show-up identification was so\r\nsuggestive that it violated the defendant's right to due process. Id. at 196-201. In\r\nState v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 600 S.E.2d 523 (2004), our supreme court noted\r\n\"[t]he United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry5 to\r\n\r\n5 Under this inquiry, the court must first determine whether the identification\r\nprocess was unduly suggestive and, next, must determine whether the out-of-court\r\nidentification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of\r\nmisidentification existed. State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447\r\n(2000). Only if the procedure was suggestive need the court consider whether\r\nthere was a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Id. at 287, 540\r\nS.E.2d at 447-48.\r\n\ndetermine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.\" Id. at 81, 600 S.E.2d\r\nat 526 (citing Biggers) (emphasis added). Our courts now consistently recognize\r\nthe general rule that a trial court must, when identification of a defendant is an\r\nissue, hold an in camera hearing \"when the State offers a witness whose testimony\r\nidentifies the defendant as the person who committed the crime, and the defendant\r\nchallenges the in-court identification as being tainted by a previous, illegal\r\nidentification or confrontation.\" State v. Miller, 359 S.C. 589, 596, 598 S.E.2d\r\n297, 301 (Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis added), aff'd, 367 S.C. 329, 626 S.E.2d 328\r\n(2006). Our courts have refused, however, to extend the requirements of a Biggers\r\nhearing to protect criminal defendants against identifications that occur for the first\r\ntime in court, without a pretrial identification. State v. Lewis, 363 S.C. 37, 42-43,\r\n609 S.E.2d 515, 517-18 (2005).\r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, it is undisputed that Tracy's voice identification occurred for\r\nthe first time in court. Heller did not challenge the voice identification by Tracy as\r\nbeing suggestive or in any way tainted by a previous, illegal identification or\r\nconfrontation. Thus, a Biggers hearing was not warranted in this case.6 Further,\r\nHeller fails to point to any authority that requires an in camera hearing to address\r\nwhether a proper foundation exists for testimony concerning an in-court, first time,\r\nvoice identification.7 Additionally, the record clearly shows the trial court initially\r\nsustained Heller's objection to Tracy's in-court voice identification, and only after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6Heller's reliance on the California Supreme Court case of People v. Clark, for the\r\nproposition that the trial court erred in failing to hold an in camera hearing on the\r\nvoice identification evidence, is equally misplaced, as that case involved an in\r\ncamera hearing wherein a voice identification was challenged as impermissibly\r\nsuggestive based upon an inherently suggestive single-voice lineup in an out of\r\ncourt proceeding.\r\n7 Rule 104(c), SCRE, provides that \"[h]earings on the admissibility of . . . pretrial\r\nidentifications of an accused shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of\r\nthe jury,\" and \"[h]earings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when\r\nthe interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness and so requests.\"\r\nHowever, Heller has not cited this rule, either at trial or on appeal, and additionally\r\nhas presented no argument whatsoever that \"the interests of justice require\" an in\r\ncamera hearing on the matter.\r\n\nthe solicitor laid a proper foundation did the trial court allow the voice\r\nidentification into evidence.8 Accordingly, we find no error.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find, although the trial court failed to make an on-the-\r\nrecord Colf analysis, any possible error in the admission of Heller's prior\r\nconvictions was harmless nonetheless. Additionally, the issue concerning the\r\nmention of Heller being on \"parole leave\" by the witness is not preserved for our\r\nreview. Finally, we hold a Biggers hearing was not required on the voice\r\nidentification because Heller did not challenge the voice identification as being\r\nbased upon an inherently suggestive out of court proceeding, and a proper\r\nfoundation was laid for the admission of the testimony.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 We note that Heller did not specifically challenge the foundation for the voice\r\nidentification as inadequate at trial, but simply argued that he was entitled to an in\r\ncamera hearing to cross-examine Tracy on the voice identification. At any rate, we\r\nbelieve a sufficient foundation was laid, as Tracy testified concerning her\r\nopportunity to hear Heller's voice earlier that night, she gave a description of his\r\nvoice as being raspy and deep, and she confirmed she could recognize his voice if\r\nshe heard it again.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4991","title":"Clary v.

Clary and TUG Properties, LLC (TUG) instituted this action\r\nagainst Clifton David Borrell for breach of contract and quantum meruit, wherein\r\n\nClary and TUG asserted Borrell breached the TUG operating agreement entered\r\ninto by Clary and Borrell. From an order of the trial court granting Borrell\r\nsummary judgment on both claims, Clary appeals the grant of summary judgment\r\non the breach of contract cause of action. Specifically, Clary contends the court\r\nerred in (1) finding there was no genuine issue of material fact in controversy, as\r\nClary provided evidence Borrell signed a statement promising to pay TUG's debts\r\nand personally guaranteed TUG loans and (2) determining Borrell's personal\r\nguarantee for TUG's loans did not constitute additional capital contributions. We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 2004, Clary and Borrell entered into an operating agreement to\r\nform a limited liability company, TUG, with Clary and Borrell each initially\r\ncontributing around $70,000 for a fifty percent ownership in TUG.1 Clary and\r\nBorrell agree that the operating agreement controls the rights and obligations of\r\nClary and Borrell as the members of TUG, and is a valid contract between the two.\r\nThe operating agreement provided the stated purpose of the company was to buy\r\nand sell residential real estate. Article IV of the operating agreement includes the\r\nfollowing pertinent provisions:\r\n\r\n      4.1    Initial contributions.\r\n\r\n             Each initial member shall make the Capital Contribution\r\n      described for that Member on Exhibit A at the time and on the terms\r\n      specified on Exhibit A and shall make such additional capital\r\n      contributions as may be required of Members from time to time . . . .\r\n\r\n      4.2    Subsequent contributions.\r\n\r\n             Without creating any rights in favor of any third parties, each\r\n      member shall contribute to the Company, in cash, on or before the\r\n      date specified as hereinafter described that Member's pro rata share of\r\n      all monies that in the judgment of a Required Interest, is necessary to\r\n      enable the Company to cause the assets of the Company to be\r\n\r\n1Clary's affidavit states each party initially invested $70,000, while Borrell\r\nmaintains in his brief that he made an initial contribution of $71,000, pointing to a\r\ngeneral journal account ledger from TUG indicating a balance forward of $71,000\r\nin Borrell's capital account as of September 30, 2004.\r\n\n      properly operated and maintained and to discharge its costs, expenses,\r\n      obligations, and liabilities. A Required Interest shall determine and\r\n      notify each Member of the need for Capital Contributions pursuant to\r\n      this Section 4.2 when appropriate, which notice must include a\r\n      statement in reasonable detail of the proposed uses of the Capital\r\n      Contributions and a date . . . before which the Capital Contributions\r\n      must be made.\r\n\r\n      4.3    Failure to contribute.\r\n\r\n      A.      If a Member does not contribute by the time required all or any\r\n      portion of a Capital Contribution that Member is required to make as\r\n      provided by this Operating Agreement, the Company may exercise,\r\n      on notice to that Member (the \"Delinquent Member\"), one or more of\r\n      the following remedies:\r\n\r\n             (2) permitting the other Members on a pro rata basis or in such\r\n      other percentages as they may agree (the \"Lending Member,\" whether\r\n      one or more), to advance the portion of the Delinquent Members\r\n      Capital Contribution that is in default, with the following results:\r\n\r\n                   (a) the sum advanced constitutes a loan from the\r\n      Lending Member to the Delinquent Member and a Capital\r\n      Contribution of that sum to the Company by the Delinquent Member\r\n      pursuant to the applicable provisions of this operating agreement.\r\n\r\n      4.5    Advanced by Members.\r\n\r\n             If the Company does not have sufficient cash to pay its\r\n      obligations, any Member(s) that may agree to do so may advance all\r\n      or part of the needed funds to or on behalf of the Company. An\r\n      advance described in this section constitutes a loan from the Member\r\n      to the Company, . . . and is not a Capital Contribution.\r\n\r\nArticle I of the operating agreement includes the following pertinent definitions:\r\n\r\n      \"Capital Contribution\" means any contribution by a Member to the\r\n      capital of the Company.\r\n\n      \"Company\" means TUG PROPERTIES, LLC, a South Carolina\r\n      Limited Liability Company.\r\n\r\n      \"Delinquent Member\" means a Member who does not contribute by\r\n      the time required all or any portion of a Capital Contribution that\r\n      Member is required to make as provided in this Operating Agreement.\r\n\r\n      \"Lending Member\" means those Members, whether one or more,\r\n      who advance the portion of the Delinquent Member's Capital\r\n      Contribution that is in default.\r\n\r\n      \"Required Interest\" means One Hundred Percent (100%) percent\r\n      (sic) of all Members.\r\n\r\nArticle V, dealing with allocations and distributions, includes a provision as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      5.1 Allocations of net profits and losses from operations.\r\n\r\n             Except as may be required by § 704(c) of the Code, and\r\n      Sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 of this Article V, Net Profits, Net Losses,\r\n      items of loss of deduction and tax credit and items of income and gain\r\n      shall be apportioned among the Members as follows:\r\n\r\n             Clifton David Borrell                    50%\r\n\r\n             Jeffrey S. Clary                         50%\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the operating agreement provides under Section 3.7 of Article III\r\nthat, in regard to liability to third parties, \"Except as otherwise expressly agreed in\r\nwriting, no Member shall be liable for the debts, obligations or liabilities of the\r\nCompany, including under a judgment decree or order of a court.\"\r\n\r\nBy agreement of the parties, Clary managed the day-to-day operations of TUG,\r\nwhile Borrell had no control over such matters and acted more as a \"silent partner.\"\r\nAccording to Clary, in early 2006, he and Borrell mutually agreed to suspend\r\noperations due to the unprofitable nature and lack of capital to continue operations.\r\n\r\nIn December 2008, Clary and TUG filed this action against Borrell for breach of\r\ncontract and quantum meruit, citing Article IV, Section 5.1 of the operating\r\n\nagreement, and alleging that Borrell and Clary contributed equally to TUG for a\r\ntime, but Borrell thereafter refused to provide a fifty percent contribution as\r\nrequired by the operating agreement, causing Clary to expend his own financial\r\nresources in a greater percentage to make up for Borrell's shortfall in contributions.\r\nClary further alleged that TUG had certain outstanding obligations, that Clary and\r\nBorrell were to share equally in the profits and losses of TUG under the agreement,\r\nand though Clary made demands of Borrell to pay his equitable share of expenses\r\nand losses, Borrell refused. In addition to the net sum difference between the\r\namount Clary had contributed and the amount Borrell had contributed, as well as a\r\nfifty percent contribution for the current obligations of TUG, Clary and TUG\r\nsought punitive damages from Borrell as a deterrence of similar conduct in the\r\nfuture. Borrell answered, generally denying the allegations of the complaint and\r\nraising various counterclaims.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Borrell filed a motion for summary judgment, basing his motion on the\r\nground that Article V of the operating agreement, relied upon by Clary and TUG,\r\nonly determined how gains and losses would be apportioned between the members\r\nfor tax purposes and did not require Borrell to maintain 50% contributions to TUG\r\nto match that made by Borrell. Additionally, Borrell maintained he complied with\r\nArticle IV, Section 4.1 of the operating agreement by making the required initial\r\ncontribution to TUG and that any subsequent contributions to TUG were governed\r\nby Article IV, Section 4.2, which would have required Borrell's vote and\r\nagreement as a prerequisite to mandatory contributions of the members, which\r\nnever occurred. Thus, any additional contributions Clary made to TUG would be\r\nloans to and liabilities of TUG and would be owed by TUG, not Borrell, to Clary.\r\nFurther, Borrell noted Section 3.7 of the operating agreement provided that no\r\nmember was liable for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of TUG, so the\r\nobligations of TUG remained with TUG, and were not obligations of the individual\r\nmembers. Borrell therefore maintained he was entitled to summary judgment, as\r\nClary and TUG could present no evidence that he breached the operating\r\nagreement. Borrell also argued TUG was not a proper party to litigate this matter\r\nagainst Borrell, because Borrell and Clary are each fifty percent owners, and a vote\r\nfrom them regarding TUG's litigation against Borrell would be deadlocked.\r\nBorrell also asserted the action for quantum meruit was not proper, as the parties\r\nagreed they were governed by the operating agreement, and quantum meruit is an\r\nequitable remedy available only when there is no contract. Lastly, Borrell\r\ncontended the demand for punitive damages should be struck, because punitive\r\ndamages are not available in a breach of contract cause of action, or in the\r\nalternative under contract theory of quantum meruit. Borrell supported his motion\r\nwith his affidavit, wherein he stated he complied with Article IV, Section 4.1 of the\r\n\noperating agreement by making his initial required capital contribution, and he\r\n\"never voted, authorized, consented or agreed to subsequent contributions, which is\r\nrequired by the express terms of Article IV, Section 4.2\" of the operating\r\nagreement, nor did he waive his right to such.\r\n\r\nIn response, Clary asserted that, after he and Borrell determined they needed to\r\nclose down the business, Borrell agreed to make a \"final subsequent contribution to\r\nzero out the company.\" However, when Clary and the accountants attempted to\r\nsend Borrell records to show the need for subsequent capital contributions to make\r\nthis happen, Borrell did not want to pay anymore. Clary maintained that both he\r\nand Borrell had made subsequent contributions to TUG after their initial capital\r\ncontributions, but once the decision was made to close the business, Borrell failed\r\nto make any subsequent contributions. Contrary to Borrell's assertion, Clary\r\nargued he could show Borrell did in fact make contributions to TUG beyond his\r\ninitial contribution during the course of the business, and submitted his affidavit,\r\naverring the same. Clary maintained that in May 2005, Borrell contributed\r\n$10,000 for the purchase of certain property on Ramsgate Drive in Augusta,\r\nGeorgia. He further asserted Borrell loaned his creditworthiness on behalf of TUG\r\nto several loans for purchases of property, ostensibly presenting copies of notes\r\nreferencing Borrell's personal guarantee of loans for the Ramsgate Drive property,\r\nas well as for Calvary Drive and Wrightsboro Drive in Augusta, Georgia.\r\nAdditionally, Clary submitted a handwritten statement, allegedly signed by Borrell\r\non September 22, 2006, which Clary asserted constituted Borrell's \"vote or blanket\r\nacquiescence in and for payment of debts so as to comply with Section 4.2 of\r\nArticle IV\" of the operating agreement. Clary noted that Section 4.3 of the\r\noperating agreement provided that if a member did not contribute his capital\r\ncontribution within the required time, and another member advanced the\r\ndelinquent member's portion, the sum advanced constituted a loan from the lending\r\nmember to the delinquent member. Clary reasoned, because he averred in his\r\naffidavit that Borrell was given notice of all meetings but failed to attend the same,\r\nBorrell's September 22 handwritten statement gave Clary authority to wind-down\r\nthe affairs of TUG and amounted to Borrell's promise to pay Clary for his share of\r\nmonies advanced by Clary toward the winding down cost.\r\n\r\nBorrell countered that Clary and TUG produced nothing through discovery that\r\nwould indicate Borrell voted to approve subsequent capital contributions, waived\r\nhis right to do the same, or actually made subsequent capital contributions. Borrell\r\nargued the only specific subsequent capital contribution Clary alleged was that\r\nBorrell contributed $10,000 for the purchase of the Ramsgate property, but the\r\nonly documentation Clary submitted to support this claim did not show Borrell\r\n\ncontributed this money as a capital contribution, and the document attached by\r\nClary showed, to the contrary, that it was classified as a loan. As to the documents\r\nsubmitted by Clary concerning Borrell acting as a personal guarantor of loans,\r\nBorrell argued a personal guaranty does not qualify as capital contributed to TUG,\r\nas it added no value to TUG and there was no accounting for the personal\r\nguarantee in the TUG capital account for Borrell. Additionally, any personal\r\nguaranty would be a liability of Borrell, not TUG, and therefore could not\r\nconstitute capital contributions as defined by the operating agreement. Finally, in\r\nregard to the handwritten document relied upon by Clary, which appeared to be\r\nsigned by Borrell and stated, \"Jeff, when the accounts are settled if I owe you I will\r\npay you,\" Borrell maintained no reasonable interpretation of the document\r\nindicated Borrell would pay any debts of TUG, and any money Clary paid to settle\r\nthe debts of TUG would constitute a loan, as there was no vote or agreement by\r\nBorrell to make a subsequent capital contribution to TUG. Borrell additionally\r\nnoted that the purported handwritten statement from him included a condition\r\nprecedent, such that performance was expressly conditioned upon him owing\r\nmoney to Clary. In summary, Borrell maintained Clary produced no evidence to\r\ndisavow Borrell's position that no consensus was ever reached regarding additional\r\ncapital contributions as required by Section 4.2 of Article IV of the operating\r\nagreement, and any money allegedly advanced by Clary to TUG was nothing more\r\nthan a loan to TUG by Clary.\r\n\r\nThe trial court issued an order granting Borrell's motion for summary judgment.\r\nThe court found Clary and TUG (1) provided no evidence any decision was made\r\nby one hundred percent of the members regarding the need for additional capital as\r\nrequired by Article IV, Section 4.2 of the operating agreement, (2) provided no\r\nevidence to refute the language of Article IV, Section 4.5 of the operating\r\nagreement that would entitle a member who advanced funds to recover those funds\r\nas a loan, (3) provided no evidence to refute language in the operating agreement\r\nthat members are not entitled to recover capital contributions, and (4) provided no\r\nevidence that Borrell's personal guaranties for properties purchased by TUG\r\nconstituted subsequent capital contributions. The trial court, therefore, determined\r\nthat Borrell was entitled to summary judgment on this issue. Additionally, the trial\r\ncourt found Borrell was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on the\r\npunitive damages claim, that quantum meruit was not available to Clary and TUG,\r\nand there was no evidence TUG was a proper plaintiff, as there was no legal basis\r\nfor joining the company. The trial court, therefore, found there were no genuine\r\nissues of material fact, that Clary and TUG raised no issues to contravene the\r\nlanguage of the TUG operating agreement, and Borrell was entitled to summary\r\n\njudgment. Clary, alone, now appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment\r\nto Borrell on Clary's breach of contract action.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.     Whether the trial court erred in finding there was no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact in this controversy where evidence was presented that Borrell signed\r\na statement promising to pay TUG's debts and had personally guaranteed TUG's\r\nloans.\r\n\r\n2.    Whether the trial court erred in determining Borrell's personal guarantee for\r\nTUG's loans did not constitute additional capital contributions.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do\r\nnot require the services of a fact finder.\" Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580\r\nS.E.2d 433, 438 (2003) (quoting George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d\r\n868, 874 (2001)). Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\r\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\r\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP. \"A court considering summary judgment neither makes factual\r\ndeterminations nor considers the merits of competing testimony; however,\r\nsummary judgment is completely appropriate when a properly supported motion\r\nsets forth facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.\"\r\nDavid v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2006).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nClary contends the trial court erred in finding there was no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact where evidence was presented that Borrell signed a statement\r\npromising to pay TUG's debts and Borrell had personally guaranteed TUG's loans.\r\nHe argues the September 22, 2006 handwritten note by Borrell was a promise to\r\npay his share of the debts, which constituted his vote for additional capital\r\ncontributions so as to comply with Article IV, Section 4.2 of the operating\r\nagreement. In the alternative, Clary contends this statement \"is a blanket\r\nacquiescence in and for payment of the debts,\" and is Borrell's promise to pay,\r\nwhich is a contract in and of itself that has been breached. Clary additionally\r\nasserts he showed Borrell contributed more than the initial capital contribution to\r\n\nTUG through his affidavit, wherein he stated additional capital was contributed by\r\nboth parties and debt was secured in the name of both parties to purchase\r\nproperties and fund TUG's operations along with documents he presented showing\r\nBorrell personally guaranteed loans on behalf of TUG, obtained personal loans,\r\nand assumed a debt of TUG. Finally, Clary contends because limited discovery\r\noccurred at the time Borrell sought summary judgment, and Clary's present counsel\r\nhad only been involved in the matter for several days, his counsel did not have an\r\nopportunity to undertake adequate discovery to \"ferret out further information\r\nnecessary\" to properly represent his client.\r\n\r\nThe operating agreement of a limited liability company is a binding contract that\r\ngoverns the relations among the members, managers, and the company. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 33-44-103(a) (2006) (stipulating, except as otherwise provided, \"all\r\nmembers of a limited liability company may enter into an operating agreement . . .\r\nto regulate the affairs of the company and the conduct of its business, and to\r\ngovern relations among the members, managers, and company\"). Generally,\r\noperating agreements are superior to statutory authority where they are in place\r\nand address a matter, inasmuch as it is only when an operating agreement is silent\r\nas to some matter that statutory law will apply. See id. (\"To the extent the\r\noperating agreement does not otherwise provide, this chapter governs relations\r\namong the members, managers, and company.\")\r\n\r\nArticle IV, Section 4.2 of the TUG operating agreement, concerning subsequent\r\ncontributions beyond the required initial contributions, expressly provides that\r\neach member shall contribute to TUG, in cash, on or before a specified date that\r\nmember's pro rata share of all monies that in the judgment of a \"Required Interest,\"\r\nis necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of TUG, and for discharge\r\nof costs, expenses, obligations, and liabilities of TUG. This section further\r\nmandates that a \"Required Interest\" determine and notify each member of the need\r\nfor a capital contribution, and that the notice given include a statement in\r\nreasonable detail of the proposed uses of the capital contributions and a date before\r\nwhich the Capital Contributions must be made. The operating agreement further\r\ndefines \"Required Interest\" as one hundred percent of all members. Thus, in order\r\nfor Borrell to be required to make a subsequent contribution pursuant to the\r\noperating agreement, he, along with Clary, as one hundred percent of the members\r\nof TUG, must have made a determination that a cash contribution was necessary,\r\nand Borrell, as a member, must have been notified of the need for the subsequent\r\ncapital contribution, with such notice including \"a statement in reasonable detail of\r\nthe proposed uses of the Capital Contributions and a date . . . before which the\r\nCapital Contributions must be made.\"\r\n\nWe find no merit to Clary's argument that the September 22, 2006 handwritten\r\nstatement by Borrell constituted his vote for additional capital contributions so as\r\nto comply with Article IV, Section 4.2 of the operating agreement. This note,\r\npurportedly signed by Borrell, is addressed to \"Jeff\" and states, \"When the\r\naccounts are settled if I owe you money I will pay you.\" This handwritten note\r\nfails to comply with the requirements of section 4.2 of the operating agreement, as\r\n(1) there is no indication that Borrell and Clary agreed that it was necessary to\r\nmake a subsequent capital contribution, (2) there is nothing to show that Borrell\r\nwas notified of the need for a subsequent capital contribution or the date by which\r\nit must be made, and (3) there is no statement whatsoever detailing the proposed\r\nuses of any necessary capital contribution. As to Clary's alternative assertion that\r\nthis note constitutes \"a blanket acquiescence in and for payment of the debts,\"\r\nthereby qualifying as a contract in and of itself that has been breached, this\r\nargument was never raised to nor ruled on by the trial court and therefore is not\r\npreserved for review. See Pikaart v. A & A Taxi, Inc., 393 S.C. 312, 324, 713\r\nS.E.2d 267, 273 (2011) (\"A matter may not be presented for the first time on\r\nappeal; rather, it must have been both raised to and ruled upon by the court\r\nbelow.\"); Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It\r\nis axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\").\r\n\r\nWe likewise assign no importance to Clary's contention that his affidavit, along\r\nwith certain documents he presented, showed Borrell personally guaranteed loans\r\non behalf of TUG, obtained personal loans, and assumed a debt of TUG, thereby\r\nshowing Borrell contributed more than the initial capital contribution to TUG, as\r\nwe find they have no effect on this matter. Even if we were to assume the\r\ndocuments submitted by Clary in this regard were sufficient to enable the court to\r\ndetermine they represent the claimed actions by Borrell, such would not qualify as\r\nmandatory subsequent capital contributions pursuant to section 4.2 of the operating\r\nagreement. First, there is no evidence to suggest that any loans obtained or\r\nassumptions of debt by Borrell on behalf of TUG met the specifications of section\r\n4.2 regarding the necessary determination by one hundred percent of the members,\r\nnotice, and a detailed statement of proposed use. More importantly, however, we\r\nfail to discern how previous contributions by Borrell have any effect on Clary's\r\nallegation that Borrell failed to make subsequent capital contributions in\r\ncompliance with Article IV, Section 4.2 of the operating agreement. As noted,\r\nsummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact.\r\nClary's entire case rests upon his assertion that Borrell failed to make equal\r\n\ncontributions to TUG as Clary made and failed to make additional contributions to\r\ncover TUG's debts, thereby breaching the operating agreement. Thus, it is only\r\nthose contributions beyond what Borrell has already made that Clary seeks from\r\nBorrell. Further, whether Borrell may have made some voluntary contributions to\r\nTUG beyond what was required pursuant to the operating agreement is of no\r\nconcern in determining whether Borrell was thereafter required to make\r\nsubsequent capital contributions pursuant to section 4.2 of Article IV.2 See\r\nMcCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting our\r\nappellate courts recognize an overriding rule which says: \"whatever doesn't make\r\nany difference, doesn't matter\"). Here, there is simply no evidence whatsoever that\r\n(1) Borrell and Clary ever agreed it was necessary to require the members to make\r\na subsequent capital contribution, (2) that Borrell, as a member, was ever notified\r\nof the necessity of a subsequent capital contribution, or (3) that any statement\r\ndetailing the proposed use of a subsequent capital contribution and the date before\r\nwhich such contribution should be made was ever provided to Borrell as a\r\nmember, so as to meet the requirements of section 4.2 such that Borrell could be\r\nheld responsible for subsequent capital contributions.\r\n\r\nAs to Clary's contention that his attorney did not have an opportunity to undertake\r\nadequate discovery, this argument is not preserved for our review. Pikaart, 393\r\nS.C. at 324, 713 S.E.2d at 273 (noting a matter must have been both raised to and\r\nruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review).3\r\n\r\nClary next contends the trial court erred in determining that Borrell's personal\r\nguarantee for TUG's loans did not constitute additional capital contributions. He\r\nargues Borrell was \"clearly providing additional capital to [TUG] by taking on an\r\nobligation or promissory note for the organization\" and providing such a service\r\n\r\n2 Indeed, Article IV, Section 4.5 of the operating agreement expressly provides that\r\na member may advance funds on behalf of TUG when TUG does not have\r\nsufficient funds to pay its obligations, and such advance would then constitute a\r\nloan from the member to TUG, and \"not a Capital Contribution.\"\r\n3 Counsel for Clary noted at the outset of the hearing that he had filed a motion for\r\ncontinuance \"to get up to speed,\" but stated he did not \"think the facts [were] going\r\nto change from today until a later date,\" and did not object to the trial court going\r\nforward with the hearing. The trial court specifically recognized Clary's attorney\r\nhad only been hired in the week before the summary judgment hearing, and\r\nallowed counsel additional time to review documents and supplement the record\r\nwith written memorandum. Clary's counsel interposed no objection to this.\r\n\nqualifies as a capital contribution pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 33-42-810. As\r\nnoted above, we fail to see how evidence of any past voluntary contributions by\r\nBorrell are of any importance in determining this matter. Even assuming arguendo\r\nthat Borrell's personal guarantees on behalf of TUG could qualify as \"capital\r\ncontributions,\" Clary has failed to present any evidence that the contributions for\r\nwhich he seeks reimbursement were required pursuant to the terms of the operating\r\nagreement, i.e. section 4.2. Because our analysis under the first issue is\r\ndispositive, we need not address this issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\nGeorgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\nappellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue\r\nis dispositive).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order granting Borrell summary judgment is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I concur in the result reached by the majority. However,\r\nI would resolve this appeal summarily under Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR. See In re\r\nMemorandum Decisions by Court of Appeals, 322 S.C. 53, 55, 471 S.E.2d 456,\r\n457 (1993) (finding this court may resolve appeals using memorandum opinions\r\nthat give the court's reasons for deciding each issue raised on appeal). The first\r\nissue on appeal is whether the handwritten September 22, 2006 note signed by\r\nBorrell obligated him to make additional capital contributions. There is no\r\nevidence in the record to support a conclusion that it did, and no further analysis is\r\nrequired. First, the note is written to \"Jeff,\" not to the LLC. Second, the note does\r\nnot mention the LLC or any obligation to the LLC. Finally, there is no evidence in\r\nthe record the LLC voted as provided in its operating agreement to require any\r\ncapital contribution from its members after the initial contribution. As the majority\r\npoints out, we need not address the second issue on appeal.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4958","title":"State v.

Jenkins argues the trial court erred in denying his\r\nmotion to suppress DNA test results because the affidavit offered in support\r\nof the search warrant for samples of his DNA did not meet the constitutional\r\nand statutory requirements for issuance of the warrant. We agree. We\r\nremand the case to the trial court for a factual determination of whether the\r\ninevitable discovery doctrine precludes application of the exclusionary rule in\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\n      I.    Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\n      The victim testified that on the evening of April 5, 2006, she came\r\nhome from work, drank several beers, ordered a pizza, and fell asleep on her\r\ncouch. She awoke approximately two hours later to a knock at the door. The\r\nvictim recognized the man at her door as \"Black,\" a man she sometimes saw\r\nat a neighborhood grocery store called Jabbers. Black frequently hung\r\naround outside Jabbers, and she occasionally said hello to him.\r\n\r\n      According to the victim, she answered the door, and Black asked if she\r\nwanted to get a beer with him. After the victim declined, Black asked her to\r\nput away her two dogs. She put away the dogs, and Black entered her house.\r\nThe two of them sat on the victim's couch while Black smoked a cigarette,\r\nusing a glass candle holder as an ashtray. Black then demanded she show\r\nhim her genitals or else he would kill her. A struggle ensued in which Black\r\nhit the victim in the head and face multiple times with the candle holder,\r\nremoved her pants and underwear, and raped her. Black told the victim\r\n\"don't tell anyone or I will kill you,\" and left.\r\n\r\n      The victim explained that because she could not find her cordless\r\nphone, she ran down the street looking for help. Near Jabbers, the victim\r\nencountered a woman who asked her what happened. At that moment, Black\r\napproached the victim, took her by the arm, and guided her to a hose so she\r\ncould wash blood off of her face. Black then handed the victim her cordless\r\nphone. She ran home and called 911.\r\n\n      When the police arrived at the victim's house, she described the\r\nincident and gave them the name \"Black.\" Within thirty minutes, police\r\nlocated Jenkins in an abandoned building across the street from Jabbers. The\r\npolice brought the victim to the store parking lot, where she identified\r\nJenkins as the man who raped her. After the victim identified Jenkins, she\r\nunderwent a rape examination. The nurse who performed the examination\r\nobserved a large amount of fluid in the victim's vagina, and she took evidence\r\nswabs of the victim's vagina and other parts of her body.\r\n\r\n      The next day, the police sought a search warrant for samples of Jenkins'\r\nblood and hair. A detective who responded to the victim's 911 call prepared\r\nthe affidavit in support of the warrant. In the affidavit, the detective wrote\r\nonly the following:\r\n\r\n           On 4-5-06 at approx. 2230hrs while at [victim's\r\n           address], the subject Daniel Jerome Jenkins (BM, dob\r\n           6-17-60) did enter the victim's residence and\r\n           threatened to kill her if she did not comply with his\r\n           demands to perform oral sex on her. The victim\r\n           attempted to fight the subject, however he\r\n           overpowered her by striking her in and about her face\r\n           using a glass candle holder. The subject then\r\n           penetrated the victim's vagina with his tongue and\r\n           penis. The DNA samples of blood, head hair, and\r\n           pubic hair will be retrieved from the subject by a\r\n           trained medical personnel in a medical facility. This\r\n           collection of these sample [sic] will be conducted in a\r\n           noninvasive manner.\r\n\r\nThe detective did not supplement the affidavit with oral testimony. The\r\nmagistrate read the affidavit and signed the warrant. The police executed the\r\nwarrant, obtaining blood and hair samples from Jenkins.\r\n\r\n     SLED analyzed Jenkins' samples and the swabs taken from the victim.\r\nA SLED forensic DNA analyst found semen on several swabs, including the\r\nvaginal swab. The analyst developed a DNA profile from the vaginal swab\r\nand compared it to a DNA profile developed from Jenkins' samples. The\r\n\nprofiles matched, with a one-in-8.6 quintillion1 chance the semen came from\r\nan unrelated person.\r\n\r\n      At trial, the victim testified in the detail set out above that Jenkins\r\nraped her. Later in the trial, the State called the DNA analyst to testify to the\r\nresults of the DNA comparison. After the trial court found the warrant was\r\nvalid and denied Jenkins' motion to suppress, the witness testified to the\r\nresults of the comparison and its degree of certainty.\r\n\r\n      The jury found Jenkins guilty. Because he had prior convictions for\r\ncriminal sexual conduct in the first degree and carjacking, both \"most serious\r\noffense[s]\" under section 17-25-45(C)(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2011), the trial court imposed a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no\r\npossibility of parole. See S.C. Code Ann. § 17-25-45(A)(1)(a) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n      II.   The Validity of the Search Warrant\r\n\r\n      A search warrant allowing the government to obtain evidence from a\r\nsuspect's body is a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment and,\r\ntherefore, must comply with constitutional and statutory requirements. State\r\nv. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 53, 625 S.E.2d 216, 222 (2006). To secure a warrant\r\nfor the acquisition of such evidence, the State must establish the following\r\nelements: (1) probable cause to believe the suspect committed the crime; (2)\r\na clear indication that relevant evidence will be found; and (3) the method\r\nused to secure it is safe and reliable. 367 S.C. at 53-54, 625 S.E.2d at 223\r\n(quoting In re Snyder, 308 S.C. 192, 195, 417 S.E.2d 572, 574 (1992) (per\r\ncuriam)); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 17-13-140 (2003). The magistrate must\r\nalso consider the seriousness of the crime and the importance of the evidence\r\nto the investigation, weighing \"'the necessity for acquiring involuntary\r\nnontestimonial identification evidence against constitutional safeguards\r\nprohibiting unreasonable bodily intrusions, searches, and seizures.'\" Baccus,\r\n367 S.C. at 54, 625 S.E.2d at 223 (quoting Snyder, 308 S.C. at 195, 417\r\nS.E.2d at 574).\r\n\r\n1 The number representing one quintillion is a one followed by eighteen\r\nzeros. Webster's New World College Dictionary 1178 (4th ed. 2008).\r\n\n       We find the affidavit, which was the only information presented to the\r\nmagistrate in support of the warrant application, does not meet the\r\nrequirements of Baccus. See State v. Arnold, 319 S.C. 256, 259, 460 S.E.2d\r\n403, 405 (Ct. App. 1995) (per curiam) (stating a court reviewing the validity\r\nof a warrant may consider only information presented to the magistrate who\r\nissued the warrant). In particular, we find the affidavit does not demonstrate\r\nthat the police had probable cause to believe that Jenkins raped the victim or\r\nthat Jenkins' DNA was relevant to the investigation. Therefore, we hold the\r\ntrial court erred in finding the warrant was valid.\r\n\r\n            A.    Probable Cause that Jenkins Committed the Crime\r\n\r\n       A probable cause determination requires a magistrate to \"'make a\r\npractical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set\r\nforth in the affidavit before her, including the \"veracity\" and \"basis of\r\nknowledge\" of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair\r\nprobability that . . . evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.'\"\r\nState v. Herring, 387 S.C. 201, 212, 692 S.E.2d 490, 495-96 (2009) (quoting\r\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)). On review, our duty is to ensure\r\nthat the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause\r\nexisted. 387 S.C. at 212, 692 S.E.2d at 495; see also State v. Weston, 329\r\nS.C. 287, 290, 494 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1997) (stating a reviewing court should\r\ngive great deference to a magistrate's determination of probable cause).\r\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we find the affidavit in this\r\ncase did not provide the magistrate a substantial basis for concluding there\r\nwas probable cause that Jenkins committed the crime.\r\n\r\n      First, the affidavit must set forth facts as to why the police believe the\r\nsuspect whose DNA is sought is the person who committed the crime. See\r\nState v. Smith, 301 S.C. 371, 373, 392 S.E.2d 182, 183 (1990) (finding an\r\naffidavit defective because it \"sets forth no facts as to why police believed\r\nSmith\" committed the robbery). Applying that requirement in Baccus, our\r\nsupreme court found the affidavit defective and therefore found there was an\r\ninsufficient basis for a finding of probable cause. 367 S.C. at 52, 625 S.E.2d\r\nat 222. The court stated: \"This affidavit fails to set forth any facts as to why\r\npolice believed Appellant committed the crime. The language in the affidavit\r\n\nlacks [specificity] and contains conclusory statements. Given the totality of\r\nthe circumstances, we conclude the issuing magistrate did not have a\r\nsubstantial basis to find probable cause.\" Id. Similarly, the affidavit in this\r\ncase lacks specificity and contains nothing more than conclusory statements.\r\n\"The affidavit must set forth particular facts and circumstances underlying\r\nthe existence of probable cause to allow the magistrate to make an\r\nindependent evaluation of the matter.\" 367 S.C. at 50-51, 625 S.E.2d at\r\n221 (citing Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 165 (1978)). The affidavit in\r\nthis case fails to meet the requirement of showing why the police believed\r\nJenkins committed the crime.\r\n\r\n       Second, the affidavit does not set forth the source of the facts alleged in\r\nit. In Smith, the defendant sought to suppress a knife seized from his hotel\r\nroom that was allegedly used in a robbery. 301 S.C. at 372, 392 S.E.2d at\r\n183. The affidavit supporting the search warrant stated that the defendant\r\ncommitted the robbery, he had been staying in the hotel room, \"and there is\r\nevery reason to believe the weapon and clothes used in the robbery will be\r\nlocated in the room.\" Id. The affidavit also stated \"[t]his information was\r\nconfirmed in person by Sgt. Sherman . . . .\" Id. Our supreme court found the\r\naffidavit \"defective on its face,\" in part because \"[a]lthough the record reveals\r\nthat police relied upon information from an informant, there is no indication\r\nthat this fact was made known to the magistrate . . . .\" 301 S.C. at 373, 392\r\nS.E.2d at 183. Similarly, the affidavit in this case is defective because it\r\ncontains no indication as to where the detective obtained the information.\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, the State argues that because this case involves a sex\r\ncrime, the magistrate could reasonably have inferred the victim was the\r\nsource of the information. We disagree. The law does not allow the State to\r\njustify a bodily intrusion on the possibility that a magistrate made a correct\r\ninference as to the source of the information in the affidavit. Rather, \"[m]ere\r\nconclusory statements which give the magistrate no basis to make a judgment\r\nregarding probable cause are insufficient.\" Smith, 301 S.C. at 373, 392\r\nS.E.2d at 183. Moreover, the complete absence of a source for any of the\r\ninformation makes a variety of scenarios possible. For example, the detective\r\ncould have pieced together the information from other officers, the victim's\r\nneighbors, or even an anonymous tip. This is precisely what the law forbids\r\na magistrate from doing. The magistrate's \"'action cannot be a mere\r\n\nratification of the bare conclusions of others.'\" Id. (quoting Gates, 462 U.S.\r\nat 239).\r\n\r\n      Third, the affidavit does not contain even a conclusory assertion that\r\nthe information or its source is reliable. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238 (stating\r\nthe circumstances a magistrate must consider include the \"veracity\" of the\r\npersons supplying the information on which the warrant is based). \"Without\r\nany information concerning the reliability of the informant, the inferences\r\nfrom the facts which lead to the complaint will be drawn not by a neutral and\r\ndetached magistrate, as the Constitution requires, but instead, by a police\r\nofficer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime . . .\r\n.\" State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 248, 395 S.E.2d 167, 169 (1990) (citation\r\nand quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n      Viewing these deficiencies together and considering the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, we find the police did not provide the magistrate a substantial\r\nbasis on which to find probable cause to believe Jenkins committed this\r\ncrime.      B.    Clear Indication that Jenkins' Samples Are Relevant\r\n\r\n       The information presented to a magistrate to obtain a warrant for bodily\r\nintrusion must contain \"a clear indication that relevant evidence will be\r\nfound.\" Baccus, 367 S.C. at 53-54, 625 S.E.2d at 223. The trial court stated:\r\n\"Clearly DNA or genetic material is . . . evidence relevant to the question of\r\nthe suspect's guilt on the crime of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.\"\r\nHowever, this statement is true only if the police have DNA from the victim\r\nor the crime scene to which they can compare the suspect's DNA.\r\nAccordingly, to show that a suspect's DNA is relevant under the second\r\nelement of Baccus, the State must show there is other DNA evidence in the\r\ncase to which it can be compared, or in some other manner clearly indicate\r\nthe relevance of the DNA sought.\r\n\r\n      The affidavit in this case does not contain any indication as to whether\r\nthe police had other DNA evidence to which Jenkins' DNA profile could be\r\n\ncompared.2 Cf. State v. Chisholm, 395 S.C. 259, 266-68, 717 S.E.2d 614,\r\n617-18 (Ct. App. 2011) (affirming an order requiring defendant to provide a\r\nDNA sample where the State presented evidence to the magistrate that the\r\nvictim's clothing contained the DNA of an unidentified male); State v.\r\nSanders, 388 S.C. 292, 298, 696 S.E.2d 592, 595 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding the\r\nsecond Baccus element met because the State showed it could compare\r\ndefendant's blood sample to blood found on a victim's shirt); State v.\r\nSimmons, 384 S.C. 145, 176, 682 S.E.2d 19, 35-36 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n(affirming an order requiring defendant to provide a palm print because it\r\ncould be compared to a palm print lifted from the car he was accused of\r\nstealing). Thus, the affidavit failed to clearly indicate the relevance of\r\nJenkins' DNA.\r\n\r\n      III. Whether the Trial Court's Error Was Harmless\r\n\r\n      The State argues any error in admitting the DNA comparison results\r\nwas harmless in light of other evidence of Jenkins' guilt. \"To deem an error\r\nharmless, this court must determine 'beyond a reasonable doubt the error\r\ncomplained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.'\" State v. Fonseca,\r\n383 S.C. 640, 650, 681 S.E.2d 1, 6 (Ct. App. 2009) (quoting Taylor v. State,\r\n312 S.C. 179, 181, 439 S.E.2d 820, 821 (1993)), aff'd, 393 S.C. 229, 711\r\nS.E.2d 906 (2011); see also Baccus, 367 S.C. at 55, 625 S.E.2d at\r\n223 (\"When guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no\r\nother rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside a\r\nconviction for insubstantial errors not affecting the result.\"). In Baccus, the\r\nsupreme court found the trial court's error in admitting the DNA to be\r\nharmless. 367 S.C. at 56, 625 S.E.2d at 224. As the court indicated,\r\nhowever, the other evidence in the case conclusively proved the defendant\r\nguilty.           The State presented the testimony of [the\r\n            victim's friend] who overheard Appellant tell the\r\n            victim he was going to kill her and who overheard a\r\n\r\n2The detective who prepared the affidavit admitted that when she prepared it,\r\nshe did not know the results of the victim's rape examination.\r\n\n            pop and clicking sound. Additionally, the State\r\n            presented evidence that Appellant's fingerprints\r\n            matched fingerprints on the window sill of the broken\r\n            window in the victim's bedroom. Also, [a DNA\r\n            analyst] testified the blood sample collected from\r\n            Appellant on the night of his arrest matched the blood\r\n            found on the swabs and cuttings from the door, blind,\r\n            and sheet in the victim's house. Therefore, the blood\r\n            evidence drawn pursuant to the court order which\r\n            should have been excluded was cumulative.\r\n\r\n367 S.C. at 55, 625 S.E.2d at 223-24.\r\n\r\n      In Baccus, the DNA match to the defendant would have been in\r\nevidence regardless of the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress. The\r\nadmissible DNA evidence, combined with the friend's testimony she heard a\r\ngunshot immediately after she heard the defendant tell the victim he was\r\ngoing to kill her, \"conclusively\" proved the defendant guilty and left no\r\nrational conclusion but that he was guilty of murder. 367 S.C. at 55-56, 625\r\nS.E.2d at 224. Without the DNA in this case, on the other hand, the State\r\nwould have been forced to rely heavily on the credibility of the victim.\r\nJenkins' fingerprint in the victim's home proved he was there, the presence of\r\nfluids in her body proved someone had sex with her, and the facial injuries\r\nproved someone violently assaulted her. However, removing the DNA\r\nleaves only the victim's credibility to prove two key facts necessary for a\r\nconviction: that Jenkins was the person who had sex with her,3 and that the\r\n\r\n3 The State suggests that Jenkins argued the sex was consensual and thus\r\nconceded he had sex with the victim. We disagree. Jenkins' counsel cross-\r\nexamined witnesses to elicit evidence that many of the victim's injuries were\r\nconsistent with consensual sex, argued this evidence to the jury, argued that\r\n\"all [the DNA] can do is tell you they had sex,\" and further argued several\r\npoints supporting an inference the sex was consensual. We do not believe\r\nthis rises to a concession. Rather, counsel is entitled to argue to the jury that\r\nthe State has failed to prove an essential element of the crime—the sex was\r\nnot consensual—without conceding the occurrence of sex.\r\n\nsex was not consensual. See State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 480, 716 S.E.2d\r\n91, 95 (2011) (stating \"[b]ecause the [victim]'s credibility was the most\r\ncritical determination of this case, we find the admission of the written\r\nreports was not harmless\"), reh'g denied, (Oct. 19, 2011); 394 S.C. at 482,\r\n716 S.E.2d at 96 (Kittredge, J., concurring) (stating \"it may be a rare\r\noccurrence for the State to prove harmless error . . . in these circumstances\").4\r\nWe cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that the DNA comparison results\r\nin this case, which the DNA analyst testified had a one-in-8.6 quintillion\r\nlikelihood of error, did not contribute to or affect the verdict.5\r\n\r\n      IV.   Inevitable Discovery of Jenkins' DNA\r\n\r\n      As an additional sustaining ground, the State argues that even if the\r\nsearch was illegal because of the defective affidavit, the DNA evidence was\r\nadmissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. The inevitable discovery\r\ndoctrine is an exception to the exclusionary rule which requires the State to\r\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that the same evidence seized\r\nunlawfully would have been discovered inevitably by lawful means. See\r\nState v. Brown, 389 S.C. 473, 483, 698 S.E.2d 811, 816 (Ct. App. 2010), cert.\r\ngranted, (Dec. 15, 2011); see also Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 447 (1984)\r\n(holding evidence may be admitted despite a violation of the Fourth\r\nAmendment \"if the government can prove that the evidence would have been\r\nobtained inevitably and, therefore, would have been admitted regardless of\r\n\r\n4 Our finding that the error was not harmless is based on our analysis of the\r\nfacts of this individual case, not based on any categorical rule. See Jennings,\r\n394 S.C. at 482, 716 S.E.2d at 95-96 (Kittredge, J., concurring), and 394 S.C.\r\nat 483, 716 S.E.2d at 96 (Toal, C.J., dissenting) (collectively overruling Jolly\r\nv. State, 314 S.C. 17, 443 S.E.2d 566 (1994), to the extent Jolly imposes a\r\ncategorical or per se rule regarding harmless error).\r\n5We acknowledge the DNA evidence does not bear directly on the question\r\nof whether the sex was consensual. However, the DNA corroborated the\r\nvictim's testimony that it was Jenkins who had sex with her. Because the\r\nDNA bolstered her credibility on this important point, we cannot say the\r\nDNA did not contribute to her credibility as to whether the sex was\r\nconsensual.\r\n\nany overreaching by the police\"). When the doctrine applies, the evidence\r\nwill not be suppressed despite the fact it was obtained pursuant to an illegal\r\nsearch. Brown, 389 S.C. at 483, 698 S.E.2d at 816.\r\n\r\n      The State first argues that because probable cause did in fact exist, the\r\ninevitable discovery doctrine applies. We disagree. While the police could\r\nhave presented evidence to the magistrate sufficient to establish probable\r\ncause, that does not satisfy the requirement that the State prove it would\r\ninevitably have discovered Jenkins' DNA. As the Fourth Circuit has stated:\r\n\"The inevitable discovery doctrine cannot rescue evidence obtained via an\r\nunlawful search simply because probable cause existed to obtain a warrant\r\nwhen the government presents no evidence that the police would have\r\nobtained a warrant.       Any other rule would emasculate the Fourth\r\nAmendment.\" United States v. Allen, 159 F.3d 832, 842 (4th Cir. 1998).6\r\n\r\n      The State also argues that discovery of Jenkins' DNA was inevitable\r\nbecause the State DNA Identification Record Database Act required that\r\nJenkins' DNA be tested for inclusion in the State DNA database. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 23-3-610 (2007) (establishing State DNA database); § 23-3-\r\n620(A) (Supp. 2011) (providing a person arrested for a felony must provide a\r\nDNA sample); § 23-3-620(B) (Supp. 2011) (providing a prisoner may not be\r\nreleased until he provides a DNA sample); § 23-3-640 (2007) (requiring all\r\nDNA samples taken pursuant to the Act be submitted to SLED for testing and\r\nsecure storage); § 23-3-650(A) (Supp. 2011) (permitting SLED to make\r\nsamples available to local law enforcement and solicitor's offices \"in\r\nfurtherance of an official investigation of a criminal offense\"). The State\r\ncontends on appeal that Jenkins was tested pursuant to the Act because of his\r\nprior conviction and imprisonment for criminal sexual conduct, and his DNA\r\nprofile is included in the State DNA database. However, because the trial\r\n\r\n6 Allen involved a situation where the police never sought a warrant in the\r\nfirst place. See 159 F.3d at 834-37. The difference between that situation\r\nand this case, where the police obtained a defective warrant, is immaterial as\r\nto the inevitable discovery doctrine. In both situations, allowing the doctrine\r\nto excuse the requirement of a valid warrant simply because the State can\r\nlater establish that probable cause existed would render the Fourth\r\nAmendment meaningless.\r\n\ncourt ruled the search was legal, the State never had an opportunity to present\r\nevidence to prove its contention.7\r\n\r\n       The purpose of the exclusionary rule \"'is to deter—to compel respect\r\nfor the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way—by\r\nremoving the incentive to disregard it.'\" State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541, 560-\r\n61, 216 S.E.2d 501, 511 (1975) (quoting Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S.\r\n206, 217 (1960)). However, the exclusionary rule was not designed to apply\r\nto every violation of the Fourth Amendment. See Weston, 329 S.C. at 293,\r\n494 S.E.2d at 804 (\"Suppression is appropriate in only a few situations . . .\r\n.\"); State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 113, 352 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1987)\r\n(\"Exclusion of evidence is not the only means available to insure that\r\nwarrants are properly issued.\" (citing Sachs, 264 S.C. at 556, 216 S.E.2d at\r\n509)). In Sachs, our supreme court observed \"[t]he exclusionary rule is harsh\r\nmedicine,\" and \"[e]xclusion should be applied only where deterrence is\r\nclearly subserved.\" 264 S.C. at 566, 216 S.E.2d at 514. When the State has\r\nmet its burden of proving it inevitably would have discovered the evidence,\r\nthe \"deterrence\" purpose of the exclusionary rule is not \"clearly subserved,\"\r\nid., and \"'there is no rational basis to keep that evidence from the jury in order\r\n\r\n7 The State's petition for rehearing includes an uncertified copy of a printout\r\nfrom SLED indicating the State DNA database contains Jenkins' DNA\r\nprofile. The printout has not been authenticated under Rule 901(a), SCRE, is\r\nnot part of the record on appeal, and contains no indication a DNA expert\r\ncould actually use the profile. The State's contention that the printout proves\r\nits inevitable discovery claim misses the point of the inevitable discovery\r\ndoctrine. The issue as to inevitable discovery is not whether a state agency\r\nseparate from the prosecutor has Jenkins' profile in its database. Rather, the\r\ndoctrine places on the State the burden of proving that the law enforcement\r\nagencies investigating or the solicitor's office prosecuting Jenkins inevitably\r\nwould have obtained Jenkins' genetic profile from this database and that the\r\nlawfully-obtained profile could be compared to the profile developed from\r\nthe semen found in the victim. Standing alone, the printout establishes only\r\nthat the solicitor's office or investigating agency might have obtained the\r\nprofile from the State DNA database. The inevitable discovery doctrine\r\nrequires the State to establish it inevitably would have obtained it and could\r\nhave used it.\r\n\nto ensure the fairness of the trial proceedings.'\" State v. Spears, 393 S.C. 466,\r\n482, 713 S.E.2d 324, 332 (Ct. App. 2011) (quoting Nix, 467 U.S. at 447).\r\nTherefore, the inevitable discovery doctrine represents an important policy\r\ndetermination that the \"harsh medicine\" of excluding probative evidence\r\nshould be avoided when doing so does not advance the objectives of the\r\nexclusionary rule by deterring violation of constitutional rights. See James v.\r\nIllinois, 493 U.S. 307, 312 (1990) (noting the basis of exceptions to the\r\nexclusionary rule includes \"the likelihood that admissibility of such evidence\r\nwould encourage police misconduct\").\r\n\r\n       In this particular case, we find it appropriate to remand to the trial court\r\nfor an evidentiary hearing as to whether the inevitable discovery doctrine\r\napplies. The issue is presented to us on appeal from the trial court's denial of\r\nJenkins' suppression motion on the basis that the search was legal. Therefore,\r\nthe State did not need to present evidence in support of the inevitable\r\ndiscovery doctrine to proceed with the trial. While it would have been\r\npossible for the State to make a record on this issue, doing so would have\r\nbeen impractical. As our supreme court has explained: \"It would be\r\ninefficient and pointless to require a respondent to return to the judge and ask\r\nfor a ruling on other arguments . . . . It also could violate the principle that a\r\ncourt usually should refrain from deciding unnecessary questions.\" I'On,\r\nL.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723\r\n(2000). Given the important policy considerations behind the exclusionary\r\nrule and the inevitable discovery doctrine, we believe the determination of\r\nwhether the illegally seized evidence of Jenkins' DNA must be suppressed\r\nshould not be made by this court on a blank record. Rather, the\r\ndetermination should be made first by the trial court after an evidentiary\r\nhearing.8 If the trial court determines on remand that the inevitable discovery\r\n\r\n8 The appellate courts of South Carolina have addressed the inevitable\r\ndiscovery doctrine in only three published decisions. In two of the cases, the\r\nfactual record before the appellate court was sufficient to enable the court to\r\ndetermine whether the State met its burden of proof. Compare Spears, 393\r\nS.C. at 481, 713 S.E.2d at 332 (reviewing the trial court's ruling that the State\r\nmet its burden of proving inevitable discovery), and State v. McCord, 349\r\nS.C. 477, 485 n.2, 562 S.E.2d 689, 693 n.2 (Ct. App. 2002) (noting the police\r\nwould have inevitably discovered defendant's blood because they had a\r\n\ndoctrine applies, the conviction must be affirmed. If the trial court\r\ndetermines the doctrine does not apply, the illegally seized evidence must be\r\nsuppressed, and Jenkins must receive a new trial.\r\n      V.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n      The Fords own a residence on Hilton Head Island. It is their legal\r\nresidence and domicile. They purchased the property in 2003 and built their\r\nhouse on it in 2005. Initially, they lived in their home the entire year and\r\nnever rented it out to others.\r\n\r\n       During the summer of 2008, the Fords leased their home for ninety-one\r\ndays. They paid accommodations taxes on their rental income. While their\r\nhome was leased, they lived in a rented apartment in Sea Pines. The Fords'\r\ndrivers' licenses, voter registration cards, tax bills and returns, and utility bills\r\nall show the address of the subject property as their legal residence, and they\r\nhave never claimed any other address as their legal residence or domicile\r\nduring the time in question. In 2008, they earned $76,500 from the rental of\r\ntheir residence.\r\n\r\n       In August 2008, the Assessor received an anonymous letter stating the\r\nFords, though \"claiming the house as their permanent residence, and being\r\ntaxed at the 4% rate,\" \"are not in residence and are renting the house out on\r\nthe weekly rental market during the summer weeks for income purposes.\"\r\nBased on this information, the Assessor sought further information from the\r\nFords, who advised (1) the subject property was their \"personal home,\" (2)\r\nthey rented the property for a few weeks in the summer, and (3) they lived\r\nthere for the rest of the year. They also directed the Assessor to an internet\r\nsite for specific information about the rental periods and terms.\r\n\r\n      After reviewing the matter, the Assessor sent the Fords a letter\r\ninforming them that their application for the four-percent assessment ratio\r\nwas denied for tax year 2008 because their property was rented for more than\r\nfourteen calendar days during the tax year. The Fords appealed the\r\n\nAssessor's decision to the Beaufort County Tax Equalization Board. The\r\nBoard held a conference on the matter and affirmed the Assessor's decision.\r\n\r\n      The Fords then initiated this action in the ALC for a contested case\r\nhearing. The ALC held a hearing in the matter and issued an order affirming\r\nthe ruling of the Board, holding (1) the Fords' home was ineligible for the\r\nfour-percent assessment ratio for 2008 because it was rented for more than\r\nfourteen days during that year and (2) the sole statutory exception to the\r\ngeneral rule that rental property does not qualify for the four-percent\r\nassessment ratio did not apply in this case. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                                    ISSUE\r\n\r\n      Did the ALC err in upholding the Assessor's decision to deny the Fords'\r\napplication for the four-percent property tax ratio for their home?\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       Tax appeals to the ALC are subject to the Administrative Procedures\r\nAct, and an appellate court is to review the ALC's decision for errors of law.\r\nCFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty. Assessor, 395 S.C. 67, 73-74, 716 S.E.2d\r\n877, 880-81 (2011). \"Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of\r\nlaw, which we are free to decide without any deference to the court below.\"\r\nId. at 74, 716 S.E.2d at 881. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      The primary focus of this appeal is section 12-43-220(c) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2011),1 which governs the eligibility of a legal\r\nresidence to be taxed on an assessment ratio equal to four percent of the fair\r\nmarket value of the property. A legal residence that is not eligible to be taxed\r\nat this ratio is generally taxed based on an assessment ratio equal to six\r\n\r\n1 Section 12-43-220 has been amended twice since this matter began;\r\nhowever, paragraph (c) was not affected by the changes.\r\n\npercent of its fair market value. S.C. Code Ann. § 12-43-220(e) (Supp.\r\n2011).Section 12-43-220(c)(1) provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n            The legal residence and not more than five acres\r\n            contiguous thereto, when owned totally or in part in\r\n            fee or by life estate and occupied by the owner of the\r\n            interest, and additional dwellings located on the same\r\n            property and occupied by immediate family members\r\n            of the owner of the interest, are taxed on an\r\n            assessment equal to four percent of the fair market\r\n            value of the property. . . . When the legal residence is\r\n            located on leased or rented property and the residence\r\n            is owned and occupied by the owner of a residence\r\n            on leased property, even though at the end of the\r\n            lease period the lessor becomes the owner of the\r\n            residence, the assessment for the residence is at the\r\n            same ratio as provided in this item. If the lessee of\r\n            property upon which he has located his legal\r\n            residence is liable for taxes on the leased property,\r\n            then the property upon which he is liable for taxes,\r\n            not to exceed five acres contiguous to his legal\r\n            residence, must be assessed at the same ratio\r\n            provided in this item. If this property has located on\r\n            it any rented mobile homes or residences which are\r\n            rented or any business for profit, this four percent\r\n            value does not apply to those businesses or rental\r\n            properties. For purposes of the assessment ratio\r\n            allowed pursuant to this item, a residence does not\r\n            qualify as a legal residence unless the residence is\r\n            determined to be the domicile of the owner-applicant.\r\n\r\n       The ALC held that under section 12-43-220(c)(1), the four-percent\r\nratio generally would not be applied to an owner-occupied legal residence if\r\nthat residence is rented for profit during the applicable tax year. In reaching\r\n\nthis conclusion, the ALC emphasized the use of the language \"any . . .\r\nresidences which are rented\" and interpreted this phrase to include a\r\ntaxpayer's legal residence.\r\n\r\n       The Fords first take issue with the ALC's rejection of their argument\r\nabout the significance of the term \"this property,\" which is used in the next-\r\nto-last sentence of section 12-43-220(c)(1). The sentence reads as follows:\r\n\"If this property has located on it any rented mobile homes or residences\r\nwhich are rented or any business for profit, this four percent value does not\r\napply to those businesses or rental properties.\" (emphases added). Whereas\r\nthe Fords argue \"this property\" includes only certain property contiguous to\r\nthe legal residence and not the property on which the legal residence is\r\nlocated, the Assessor and the ALC maintain otherwise. We agree with the\r\nAssessor and the ALC.\r\n\r\n       In the first sentence of the above-quoted passage, it is apparent that the\r\nfour-percent assessment \"of the fair market value of the property\" is a\r\npercentage of the value of the property on which the legal residence is located\r\nplus the same percentage of the value of limited surrounding acreage.\r\nFurthermore, in the sentence immediately preceding the sentence at issue\r\nhere, \"the property\" upon which a lessee is liable for taxes obviously includes\r\nthe property on which lessee's legal residence is located, as well as\r\ncontiguous property not to exceed a total of five acres. We therefore agree\r\nwith the ALC that the phrase \"this property\" in the next-to-last sentence in\r\nsection 12-43-220(c)(1) includes the property on which the legal residence of\r\nan owner-occupant is located and that a legal residence of an owner-occupant\r\nis therefore subject to the six-percent assessment ratio if it is one of \"any\r\nresidences which are rented\" and located on \"this property.\"                 See\r\nMcClanahan v. Richland Cnty. Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240,\r\n242 (2002) (\"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that\r\nlegislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\nlanguage used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended\r\npurpose of the statute.\"); Russo v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 455,\r\n458, 513 S.E.2d 127, 128 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"In statutory construction,\r\nlegislative intent prevails where it can be reasonably ascertained from the\r\nplain meaning of the statutory language.\").\r\n\n      The Fords further argue they are entitled to the four-percent assessment\r\nratio pursuant to the first sentence in section 12-43-220(c)(1) because the\r\nsubject property is their legal residence and they have satisfied the\r\nrequirements of section 12-43-220(c)(2), which lists what a taxpayer must do\r\nin order to receive the four-percent assessment ratio for an owner-occupied\r\nresidence.2 We disagree. Although a taxpayer may be entitled to have\r\nproperty taxed at the four-percent assessment ratio based on a showing that\r\nthe property for which the lower assessment ratio is sought has been that\r\ntaxpayer's legal residence for some part of the tax year, the right to be taxed\r\nat the lower rate is subject to qualifications within the same statute. See\r\nDuvall v. S.C. Budget & Control Bd., 377 S.C. 36, 42, 559 S.E.2d 125, 127\r\n(2008) (\"When construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a\r\nwhole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory law must be\r\nconstrued together and each one given effect.\"). Here, the legislature\r\nintended to grant the preferred assessment ratio only to those owner-\r\noccupants who limit the use of their legal residences to statutorily defined\r\nparameters.\r\n\r\n       The Fords also contend the ALC erroneously interpreted section 12-\r\n43-220(c)(7) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) to be the sole\r\nexception to the rule disqualifying an owner-occupant from receiving the\r\nfour-percent assessment ratio for a legal residence that is rented for profit\r\nduring the tax year. Specifically, they contend subsection (c)(7) is only a\r\n\"safe-harbor\" and their failure to meet the requirements in this subsection\r\nshould not prevent them from receiving the preferred assessment ratio. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n2  Under section 12-43-220(c)(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011),\r\n\"[t]o qualify for the special property tax assessment ratio . . . , the owner-\r\noccupant must have actually owned and occupied the residence as his legal\r\nresidence and been domiciled at that address for some period during the\r\napplicable tax year.\" This section further provides that \"[a] residence which\r\nhas been qualified as a legal residence for any part of the year is entitled to\r\nthe four-percent assessment provided in this item for the entire year . . . .\"\r\n\n      Section 12-43-220(c)(7) provides as follows:\r\n\r\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the\r\n            owner-occupant of a legal residence is not\r\n            disqualified from receiving the four percent\r\n            assessment ratio allowed by this item if the taxpayer's\r\n            residence meets the requirements of Internal Revenue\r\n            Code Section 280A(g) . . . and the taxpayer otherwise\r\n            is eligible to receive the four percent assessment\r\n            ratio.\r\n\r\nInternal Revenue Code section 280A(g), to which section 12-43-220(c)(7)\r\nrefers, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n            (g) Special rule for certain rental use.—\r\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this section\r\n            . . . , if a dwelling unit is used during the taxable year\r\n            by the taxpayer as a residence and such dwelling unit\r\n            is actually rented for less than 15 days during the\r\n            taxable year, then—\r\n\r\n            (1) no deduction otherwise allowable under this\r\n            chapter because of the rental use of such dwelling\r\n            unit shall be allowed, and\r\n\r\n            (2) the income derived from such use for the taxable\r\n            year shall not be included in the gross income of such\r\n            taxpayer under section 61.\r\n\r\n      The ALC reasoned that because (1) a statute providing that \"a thing\r\nshall be done in a certain way carries with it an implied prohibition against\r\ndoing that thing in another way\" and (2) a court should interpret a particular\r\nprovision in conjunction with the whole statute and the policy of the law\r\nrather than in isolation, it follows that the legislature intended for section 12-\r\n43-220(c)(7) to state the sole exception under which a legal residence that is\r\nrented during the tax year can receive the four-percent assessment ratio. We\r\n\nagree with the ALC's analysis. Under section 12-43-220(c)(1), the Fords\r\ncannot claim the four-percent assessment ratio for their home, and there are\r\nno other statutory criteria under which the disqualification would be waived.3\r\n\r\n       Finally, the Fords complain the ALC erroneously treated the four-\r\npercent assessment ratio as an exemption or deduction and construed it\r\nagainst them based on this allegedly incorrect characterization. They assert\r\nthe ALC did not cite any authority for the proposition that property tax\r\nassessment ratios are characterized as exemptions or deductions or that any\r\nambiguities in a tax classification statute should be construed against the\r\ntaxpayer. We disagree. The South Carolina Supreme Court has recently held\r\nthat section 12-43-220 is a tax exemption statute. See CFRE, 395 S.C. at 74,\r\n716 S.E.2d at 881 (implying section 12-43-220(c)(1) provides a statutory tax\r\nexemption and referencing \"our policy of strictly construing tax exemption\r\nstatutes against the taxpayer\"). We therefore hold the ALC correctly\r\nconstrued any uncertainty in the statute against the Fords.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We agree with the ALC's interpretation of section 12-43-220(c) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code and affirm the decision to deny the Fords' application\r\nfor a four-percent assessment ratio on their home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 In support of their position, the Fords cite an order in a case involving\r\ndifferent parties in which the ALC held the waiver of disqualification in\r\nsection 12-43-220(c)(7) was only a safe harbor provision. Although this\r\ncourt affirmed the ALC, it did so in an unpublished opinion. Neither the\r\nALC order nor this court's unpublished opinion is binding authority, and the\r\nALC in this case was not compelled to follow either decision. See Rule\r\n268(d)(2), SCACR (\"Memorandum opinions and unpublished orders have no\r\nprecedential value and should not be cited except in proceedings in which\r\nthey are directly involved.\"); 21 C.J.S. Courts § 212 (2006) (\"Trial or inferior\r\ncourt decisions are not precedents binding other courts, including appellate\r\ncourts or other judges of the same trial court.\").\r\n\nAFFIRMED.       \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4993","title":"Rice-Marko v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAppellants owned in excess of 400,000 shares of Respondent Wachovia\r\nCorporation (Wachovia) stock before Wachovia was acquired by Respondent\r\nWells Fargo & Company on December 31, 2008. Respondents G. Kennedy\r\nThompson, Thomas J. Wurtz, Donald K. Truslow, and Robert K. Steel\r\n(collectively, Individual Respondents) served as officers of Wachovia at various\r\npoints from July 2006 through 2008.1 Respondent Thomas L. Clymer was an\r\nofficer and agent of Wachovia in Charleston, South Carolina, where Appellants\r\nwere residents.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 2009, Appellants filed a complaint alleging Respondents'\r\nmisrepresentations and/or non-disclosures regarding the financial stability and\r\nperformance of Wachovia from July 2006 through 2008 caused Appellants to\r\nrefrain from selling their shares of Wachovia stock. Appellants alleged these\r\nmisrepresentations and non-disclosures caused them to \"lose millions of dollars in\r\nthe value of stock they held in Wachovia.\" According to Appellants, but for\r\nRespondents' false representations, they would have sold all of their Wachovia\r\nstock in July 2007 when the stock value was between $49.00 and $51.00 per share.\r\nAppellants maintained they continued to receive assurances from Respondents in\r\n2008 that Wachovia was financially stable and well-collateralized despite the fact\r\nthat Wachovia's stock price continued to fall. Appellants alleged that in August\r\n2008, when Wachovia's stock price was $16.49 per share, they again decided to\r\nforgo plans to sell their Wachovia stock after receiving e-mails and documents\r\n                                                            \r\n1G. Kennedy Thompson served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President of\r\nWachovia from December 1999 through June 2, 2008. Thomas J. Wurtz served as\r\nChief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President of Wachovia. Donald\r\nK. Truslow served as Chief Risk Officer for Wachovia until August 2008. Robert\r\nK. Steel was chairman of the board, CEO, and President of Wachovia from July 9,\r\n2008 through December 31, 2008.\r\n \r\n \r\n\nfrom Clymer reassuring Appellants that their investment was secure. On\r\nDecember 30 and 31, 2008, Appellant Deborah Rice-Marko sold all of her\r\nWachovia stock after the stock price had fallen below $1.00 per share.\r\n\r\nIn their complaint, Appellants asserted causes of action for fraud and fraudulent\r\nconcealment, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive\r\nfraud, breach of duties as corporate officers, negligence and gross negligence, and\r\nviolation of the South Carolina Securities Act of 2005. Appellants' allegations\r\nprimarily concerned Wachovia's 2006 acquisition of Golden West Financial\r\nCorporation, a California-based bank and mortgage lender with a large portfolio of\r\nadjustable-rate mortgages, and Wachovia's subsequent disclosures concerning\r\nthese mortgage loans. The complaint alleged Wachovia and the Individual\r\nRespondents, faced with a rapidly deteriorating housing market and a strained\r\nmortgage system, concealed information regarding underwriting standards,\r\ncollateral quality, and necessary reserves for these loans. Appellants cited\r\nnumerous allegedly false public SEC filings, press releases, and earnings calls\r\nmade by Wachovia between October 2006 and September 2008. Appellants\r\nmaintained the Individual Respondents engineered, approved, and disseminated\r\nthese misstatements. Appellants also alleged Clymer participated in the scheme\r\nthrough direct communications with Appellants.\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 2009, Respondents moved to dismiss Appellants' complaint\r\npursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure. The case was referred to the business court in January 2010, and a\r\nhearing was held on Respondents' motion on April 13, 2010.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2010, the circuit court granted Respondents' motion to dismiss,\r\nholding: (1) Appellants' claims were derivative; (2) Appellants did not allege a\r\nseparate and distinct injury; and (3) Respondents did not owe Appellants a special\r\nduty. Specifically, the circuit court, citing South Carolina and North Carolina law,\r\nheld Appellants did not have standing to bring direct claims against Wachovia or\r\nits officers and directors for \"wrongs that diminish the value of their shares\" of the\r\ncorporation. The court noted that \"because the injuries felt by [Appellants] were\r\nsuffered equally by all Wachovia shareholders, [Appellants] cannot bring a direct\r\naction to recover their proportion of the corporation's losses.\" With respect to\r\nClymer, the circuit court requested additional briefing. On August 3, 2010, the\r\ncircuit court denied Appellants' motion to alter or amend. On August 19, 2010, the\r\ncircuit court also dismissed Appellants' claims against Clymer. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the\r\nappellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court.\" Cricket\r\nCove Ventures, LLC v. Gilland, 390 S.C. 312, 321, 701 S.E.2d 39, 44 (Ct. App.\r\n2010). \"In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state\r\nfacts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial court must base its ruling\r\nsolely on allegations set forth in the complaint.\" Id. \"If the facts and inferences\r\ndrawn from the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to\r\nthe plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant of a\r\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.\" Id. \"In deciding\r\nwhether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court\r\nmust consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nplaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFiduciary and Special Duties\r\n\r\nFirst on appeal, Appellants argue they are entitled to pursue direct claims against\r\nRespondents because Respondents owed them fiduciary and special duties. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court determined Appellants lacked standing under both South Carolina\r\nand North Carolina law to bring direct claims against Respondents. The court did\r\nnot resolve the choice of law issue, noting both North Carolina and South Carolina\r\nfollow the same \"'well-established general rule' that shareholders do not have\r\nstanding to bring direct claims for wrongs that diminish the value of their shares in\r\na corporation.\" See Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 658, 488\r\nS.E.2d 215, 219 (N.C. 1997) (\"The well-established general rule is that\r\nshareholders cannot pursue individual causes of action against third parties for\r\nwrongs or injuries to the corporation that result in the diminution or destruction of\r\nthe value of their stock.\"); see also Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 51, 557 S.E.2d\r\n676, 685 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding individuals may not sue corporate directors or\r\nofficers for losses suffered by the corporation).\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina does not recognize a fiduciary duty between the officers and\r\ndirectors of a corporation and that corporation's shareholders. See N.C. Gen. Stat.\r\n§ 55-8-30 (2011). However, the North Carolina Supreme Court has held\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\n                             a shareholder may maintain an individual action against a\r\n                             third party for an injury that directly affects the\r\n                             shareholder, even if the corporation also has a cause of\r\n                             action arising from the same wrong, if the shareholder\r\n                             can show that the wrongdoer owed him a special duty or\r\n                             that the injury suffered by the shareholder is separate and\r\n                             distinct from the injury sustained by the other\r\n                             shareholders or the corporation itself.\r\n\r\nBarger, 346 N.C. at 658-59, 488 S.E.2d at 219. Although South Carolina\r\nrecognizes a duty between officers and directors of a corporation and that\r\ncorporation's shareholders2, this court has held that the fiduciary obligation of\r\ndominant or controlling stockholders or directors is ordinarily enforceable through\r\na stockholder's derivative action. See Brown, 348 S.C. at 49, 557 S.E.2d at 684.\r\n\"A shareholder may maintain an individual action only if his loss is separate and\r\ndistinct from that of the corporation.\" Id. \"An individual action is also allowed if\r\nthe alleged wrongdoers owe a fiduciary relationship to the stockholder and full\r\nrelief to the stockholder cannot be had through a recovery by the corporation.\" Id.\r\nat 50, 557 S.E.2d at 685.\r\n\r\nAppellants argue Respondents owed Appellants both a fiduciary and a special duty\r\nto accurately portray the financial condition of Wachovia. Appellants maintain\r\nthey relied on Respondents' representations due to Respondents' controlling\r\npositions and their peculiar and superior knowledge of Wachovia's financial\r\ncondition. Respondents argue Appellants' claims are derivative because\r\nAppellants only seek to recover for alleged breaches of duties Respondents owed\r\nWachovia and its shareholders, not any individual duty owed uniquely to\r\nAppellants.\r\n\r\nWe find Appellants cannot proceed with their lawsuit as individual shareholders\r\nunder the \"special duty\" exception to the general rule outlined in Barger. Here,\r\nAppellants have failed to allege any facts from which it may be inferred that\r\nRespondents owed Appellants a duty that was personal to Appellants and distinct\r\nfrom the duty Respondents owed Wachovia and its shareholders. In their\r\ncomplaint, Appellants specifically alleged the Individual Respondents \"set on a\r\n                                                            \r\n2 See S.C. Code Ann. § 33-8-300(a)(1)-(3) (2006) (requiring a corporate director to\r\nperform his duties in good faith, with the care of an ordinarily prudent person in a\r\nlike position, and in a manner he believes to be in the best interests of the\r\ncorporation).\r\n \r\n \r\n\ncourse of action to supply misrepresentations and misinformation regarding the\r\nfinancial strength, stability and liquidity of [Wachovia] as an ongoing banking\r\ncompany and to conceal the truth from [Appellants] and the investing public.\"\r\nAppellants alleged \"the Individual [Respondents], because of their positions of\r\ncontrol and authority as officers and/or directors of the Company, owed a\r\nfiduciary duty to [Appellants] to disclose and communicate truthful and accurate\r\ninformation about the financial condition and performance of the Company.\"\r\n(emphasis added) Because Appellants did not allege breaches of any duties owed\r\nto them individually, they cannot bring direct claims for their stock losses.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Appellants did not allege Clymer owed them a fiduciary or special\r\nduty or communicated with them in any way other than in their role as\r\nstockholders. In fact, in their complaint, Appellants omitted Clymer from many of\r\nthe allegations involving the Individual Respondents and from their breach of\r\nfiduciary duty claim. Instead, Appellants maintained Clymer owed them a special\r\nduty because he communicated with them directly. We find Clymer's direct\r\ncommunications with Appellants as stockholders did not give rise to a special duty.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court did not err in finding Respondents did not owe\r\nAppellants a special duty.\r\n\r\nSeparate and Distinct Injury\r\n\r\nAppellants argue they are entitled to pursue direct claims against the Respondents\r\nbecause the losses they suffered were separate and distinct from the losses to\r\nWachovia as a whole. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Barger, the North Carolina Supreme Court held\r\n\r\n            a shareholder may maintain an individual action against a\r\n            third party for an injury that directly affects the\r\n            shareholder, even if the corporation also has a cause of\r\n            action arising from the same wrong, if the shareholder\r\n            can show that the wrongdoer owed him a special duty or\r\n            that the injury suffered by the shareholder is separate and\r\n            distinct from the injury sustained by the other\r\n            shareholders or the corporation itself.\r\n\r\n346 N.C. at 658-59, 488 S.E.2d at 219.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\nHere, the circuit court determined Appellants did not suffer a separate and distinct\r\ninjury, noting that according to Appellants' complaint, Respondents lied to\r\nWachovia's other shareholders, financial markets, and the investing public at large.\r\nAppellants maintain their damages fall within the separate and distinct exception\r\nbecause the losses they suffered were not shared equally with all Wachovia\r\nshareholders. Appellants argue their claims are based on specific\r\nmisrepresentations which induced their reliance, and are not based on any\r\ncorporate mismanagement resulting in lower stock values and causing injury to all\r\nstockholders. Respondents argue Appellants failed to allege any injury not shared\r\nby their fellow Wachovia shareholders. Respondents contend damages based on\r\nthe decline in Wachovia's share price can only be brought derivatively.\r\n\r\nWe find Appellants cannot proceed with their lawsuit under the second exception\r\nto the general rule in Barger because they have not alleged a separate and distinct\r\ninjury to themselves as shareholders. Appellants alleged damages based on the\r\ndecline in Wachovia's stock price. Pursuant to Barger, such a claim can only be\r\nbrought derivatively. The Barger court held \"[a]n injury is peculiar or personal to\r\nthe shareholder if a legal basis exists to support plaintiffs' allegations of an\r\nindividual loss, separate and distinct from any damage suffered by the\r\ncorporation.\" Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220 (internal citations\r\nomitted). In Barger, the court found the only injury alleged by the shareholders\r\nwas the diminution in value of their shares as the result of the corporation's\r\nnegligent or fraudulent misrepresentations of its financial status. Id. The Barger\r\ncourt held the diminution of the value of their stock is precisely the same injury\r\nsuffered by the corporation itself, and therefore, the shareholders' claims were\r\nderivative. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, Appellants maintained in their complaint that they were deceived as part of a\r\nlarger scheme to defraud Wachovia stockholders. Specifically, Appellants alleged\r\nWachovia \"engaged in concerted actions to conceal the truth and issue reassuring\r\nmisrepresentations to financial markets and [Appellants]\" and the Individual\r\nRespondents supplied the misrepresentations to the \"investing public.\" Because\r\nAppellants failed to allege any injury separate and distinct from the injuries\r\nsuffered by other Wachovia stockholders, we affirm the circuit court.\r\n\r\nWe note the North Carolina Court of Appeals recently dismissed a complaint of\r\nseven Wachovia stockholders which contained factual allegations and legal claims\r\nsimilar to those of Appellants in this case. In Estate of Browne v. Thompson, 2012\r\nWL 1083130 (N.C. App. 2012), the North Carolina Court of Appeals determined\r\nthe special duty and separate and distinct exceptions outlined in Barger did not\r\n \r\n \r\n\napply to plaintiffs' claims. As in this case, the North Carolina plaintiffs alleged\r\nWachovia's officers and directors participated in a fraudulent scheme to deceive\r\nplaintiffs and the public as to Wachovia's financial stability. 2012 WL 1083130 at\r\n1. Plaintiffs alleged they relied on Wachovia's misrepresentations in deciding not\r\nto sell their Wachovia stock. Id. The North Carolina court found plaintiffs failed\r\nto allege any facts indicating defendants owed them special duty or that they\r\nsuffered an injury separate and distinct from that of other stockholders. Id. at 2.\r\n\r\nLaw from other jurisdictions\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in applying North Carolina, Delaware and\r\nGeorgia law instead of South Carolina law. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court found both South Carolina and North Carolina law generally\r\nprohibit stockholders from bringing direct claims for wrongs that diminish the\r\nvalue of their shares in a corporation. Appellants contend that although the result\r\nwould be the same regardless of whether South Carolina or North Carolina law is\r\napplied, the circuit court erred in applying the law of states other than South\r\nCarolina in determining whether Appellants stated a claim for relief. We find the\r\ncircuit court did not err. As discussed above, Appellants failed to allege any facts\r\nsupporting the \"separate and distinct injury\" and \"special duty\" exceptions to the\r\ngeneral rule prohibiting direct claims for stock losses.\r\n\r\nWe further find the circuit court did not err in referencing Georgia and Delaware\r\ncase law. The circuit court did not cite cases from these jurisdictions as binding\r\nprecedent, but rather referenced them as persuasive authority. Appellants\r\nspecifically argue the circuit court erred in relying on Holmes v. Grubman, 286 Ga.\r\n636, 691 S.E.2d 196 (Ga. 2010) in dismissing Clymer. We disagree. In its order,\r\nthe circuit court noted Holmes was cited in Appellants' brief, but determined\r\nHolmes did not support Appellants' claims. The circuit court found Holmes did not\r\ninvolve a shareholder suit against a corporation, and therefore, it was \"readily\r\ndistinguishable\" from the present case. Accordingly, the circuit court did not find\r\nHolmes was \"binding precedent\" as alleged by Appellants.\r\n\r\nHolder Claims\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that although neither the South Carolina nor the North Carolina\r\ncourts have ruled on the issue of whether corporate officers and directors may be\r\nheld personally liable in a direct action for fraud and misrepresentation for\r\ninducing shareholders not to sell their stock, other jurisdictions have considered\r\n \r\n \r\n\nsuch holder claims and found plaintiffs may proceed with their claims against\r\ncorporate officers. Appellants contend their holder claim justifies reversal of the\r\ncircuit court's granting of Respondents' motion to dismiss. We disagree.\r\nAppellants have failed to cite any South Carolina case law recognizing holder\r\nclaims. In addition, the North Carolina Court of Appeals recently affirmed the trial\r\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' holder claims in Estate of Brown, noting its research\r\ndid not reveal a single North Carolina case recognizing holder claims. 2012 WL\r\n1083130 at 3.\r\n\r\nClymer\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in finding Appellants failed to allege\r\nreasonable reliance on Clymer's misrepresentations. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court determined Appellants did not have standing to sue Clymer\r\ndirectly for the decrease in value of their Wachovia stock. The court found\r\nAppellants failed to plead facts giving rise to either the special duty or the separate\r\nand distinct injury exceptions to the general rule prohibiting individual stockholder\r\nactions for derivative injuries.\r\n\r\nAppellants allege Clymer directly advised them that \"Wachovia was stable, had\r\nadequate loan reserves, and that there was not another shoe to drop.\" They further\r\nallege Clymer provided them with the \"Wachovia: The Fundamentals\"\r\nmemorandum, which touted Wachovia as a \"strong and stable company on solid\r\nfooting.\" Appellants contend they relied on these direct communications with\r\nClymer in reversing their decision to sell their Wachovia stock. Respondents argue\r\nAppellants' claims against Clymer were dismissed as derivative and not, as the\r\nAppellants argue, because the circuit did not accept Appellants allegations of\r\nreliance. Respondents contend the circuit court properly dismissed Clymer\r\nbecause Appellants failed to allege he owed them a special duty or caused them an\r\ninjury separate and distinct from other Wachovia shareholders.\r\n\r\nWe do not agree with Appellants' allegation that the circuit court dismissed Clymer\r\nbecause Appellants failed to allege reasonable reliance on Clymer's\r\nmisrepresentations. We find the circuit court properly determined Appellants'\r\nclaims against Clymer were derivative and not subject to either of the exceptions to\r\nthe rule prohibiting stockholder actions for derivative injuries. As the circuit court\r\nnoted, Appellants did not allege Clymer owed them a fiduciary duty or that he had\r\nany particular contractual responsibility or obligation to them. Appellants further\r\nfailed to allege Clymer owed them a special duty by stepping outside the\r\n \r\n \r\n\nrelationship between shareholder and corporation. We do not believe Appellants'\r\nassertion that Clymer's direct communications in forwarding the \"Fundamentals\"\r\nmemorandum and telling Appellants that Wachovia was a \"stable\" corporation\r\ncreated a special duty.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Appellants have not alleged a separate and distinct injury. As the\r\ncircuit court correctly noted, Appellants did not allege Clymer provided them with\r\nany information that was materially different from the information Wachovia was\r\nallegedly providing to other stockholders. The nature of Appellants' injury was a\r\ndecline in Wachovia's stock price. This injury was suffered by all of Wachovia's\r\nstockholders, and therefore, Appellants' claims were derivative. Accordingly, the\r\ncircuit court did not err in dismissing Clymer.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's granting of Respondents'\r\nmotion to dismiss.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4994","title":"State v.

Meggett argues the trial court\r\nerred in (1) denying his motion for a continuance; (2) denying his motion for a\r\nmistrial and request for a curative instruction; and (3) denying his motion for a\r\ndirected verdict as to the first-degree burglary charge. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nMeggett and the Victim met in Charleston County in 2008. The two saw each\r\nother every few months. Meggett loaned Victim $200 to pay her bills and gave her\r\nrides to job interviews. Victim and Meggett had consensual sex in August 2008.\r\nVictim left Charleston in 2008 and returned in January 2009 to attend school.\r\nAccording to Victim, in the early morning hours of January 13, 2009, she woke up\r\nand saw Meggett sitting on the edge of her bed. Victim had not spoken to Meggett\r\nin a month and, according to Victim, he did not have permission to be in her home.\r\nThe doors to Victim's home were not locked. According to Victim, Meggett asked\r\nher about the $200 she borrowed and Victim told him she would pay him at the\r\nend of the week. Meggett then moved towards the Victim and told her he was\r\ngoing to \"take the down payment now.\" According to Victim, Meggett then\r\ngrabbed her neck, held her against the wall, and attempted to remove her pants.\r\nVictim claimed she and Meggett struggled and she yelled for him to stop. Victim\r\nclaimed Meggett choked her and then sexually assaulted her.\r\n\r\nAfter Meggett left Victim's home, Victim drove herself to the hospital. Victim\r\ninformed emergency room physician Dr. Joseph Bianco that she had been sexually\r\nassaulted and complained of pain in her arm and jaw. Dr. Bianco noted bruises on\r\nVictim's arm and jaw.1 The North Charleston Police Department was notified and\r\ntwo officers were dispatched to the hospital. Officer Robert Gooding and Sergeant\r\nEric Jourdan met with Victim and she reported the details of the assault. While\r\nspeaking with the officers, Victim received a phone call from Meggett. According\r\nto Victim, Meggett tried to convince her to leave the hospital and asked her if she\r\nwas going to tell the doctors what happened. Meggett then asked if he could come\r\nto the hospital to see Victim and she agreed. Upon his arrival, Meggett was\r\narrested by Officer Gooding.\r\n\r\nVictim was subsequently taken to MUSC Women's Center for a sexual assault\r\nexamination. Nurse Faye LeBoeuf performed a pelvic exam and discovered a\r\nsmall abrasion in Victim's vagina which likely had occurred within twenty-four to\r\nseventy-two hours of the exam. According to LeBoeuf, Victim's injury could have\r\nresulted from either consensual or non-consensual intercourse. LeBoeuf found no\r\nother bruising, redness, swelling, lacerations, or tears on Victim.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1 North Charleston Police Detective Randy Gray met with Victim the day after the\r\nincident and observed \"prominent dark bruising\" on Victim's neck.\r\n\nOfficers retrieved a comforter and blanket from Victim's bed, as well as a DNA\r\nsample from Meggett. South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) DNA\r\nanalyst Jennifer Clayton examined the Victim's comforter and determined Meggett\r\nwas the major DNA contributor in two of the comforter samples and the only DNA\r\ncontributor in the third sample. Clayton also determined Victim was excluded as a\r\ncontributor in the samples and found the presence of an unknown contributor in the\r\nsecond sample. Additionally, Clayton analyzed the semen from Victim's vaginal\r\nsample and was unable to develop a DNA profile from Meggett in that sample.\r\n\r\nMeggett was indicted by the Charleston County grand jury for first-degree burglary\r\nand first-degree CSC. A jury trial was held November 8-10, 2010. At the outset of\r\ntrial, Meggett moved for a continuance. Defense counsel stated the parties agreed\r\nMeggett and Victim had consensual sex on one prior occasion but they disagreed\r\nas to whether the consensual sex was a single incident or a repeated event.\r\nDefense counsel asserted Meggett, on the morning of trial, raised the issue of\r\nhaving a comforter from his nephew's bed in his sister's home tested for DNA\r\nevidence based on Meggett's claim he had consensual sex with Victim in the bed in\r\nthe months leading up to the incident. Defense counsel asserted the comforter was\r\nin storage and would be critical to the credibility of Victim if the evidence was\r\nthere. In rebuttal, the State argued the motion should be denied because (1) two\r\nyears had elapsed since the incident; (2) Meggett had notice of the trial; and (3)\r\nMeggett failed to raise the issue until the morning of trial. The trial court denied\r\nthe continuance motion, finding (1) the case was on the trial docket; (2) the\r\nincident occurred in January 2009; (3) it was speculative as to whether there may\r\nbe something on the comforter; and (4) the comforter had no direct connection to\r\nthe case other than to Victim and Meggett's prior sexual relationship.\r\n\r\nDuring opening arguments, defense counsel argued to the jury that \"[V]ictim and\r\n[Meggett] struck a sort of less than desirable but informal arrangement. They\r\nbegan to sleep together, and [Meggett] would forgive her debt, and it happened\r\nmore than once.\" Defense counsel stated \"[Victim and Meggett] had sex, and\r\n[Victim] thought that squared their debt, and [Meggett] didn't, and that's it.\"\r\nDefense counsel told jurors Meggett \"shoved\" and \"pushed\" Victim and his\r\nbehavior was \"wrong.\" As the trial continued, Victim and other witnesses testified\r\nabout the sexual assault and resulting law enforcement investigation.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the State's case, Meggett moved for a directed verdict. Defense\r\ncounsel asserted \"there's a decent argument to be made for the burglary,\" and\r\nfurther argued \"[t]he Victim testifies that when he comes in he's asking for the\r\nmoney that . . . she owes him. That would be all I have to say in that respect.\" The\r\n\ntrial court denied Meggett's directed verdict motion, finding evidence had been\r\npresented as to each element of the indicted offenses. Following the trial court's\r\nruling, Meggett did not testify, did not offer any other testimony, and rested his\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, during closing arguments, defense counsel asserted Victim was\r\nliving in poor conditions and \"desperate times call[ed] for desperate measures.\"\r\nDuring the State's closing argument, the solicitor stated\r\n\r\n                             In case after case involving CSC, there is one singular\r\n                             tactic that is employed by the defense, and I don't fault\r\n                             [defense counsel] for . . . doing it, but recognize it, and\r\n                             that is attack the victim. Attack the victim, call into\r\n                             question - and its fine that [defense counsel] stands up\r\n                             here and goes I don't mean to say anything. He - that's\r\n                             precisely what he means. Her history of medication, the\r\n                             fact that she's poor, the fact that she lives in a house that\r\n                             doesn't really look like a middle class home. Calls her\r\n                             unstable, calls her a liar. In opening statement he\r\n                             implied, although there's no evidence of this, that\r\n                             somehow she's a prostitute, smear -\r\n\r\nDefense counsel objected and argued the solicitor's statement amounted to burden\r\nshifting. Following closing arguments and the jury charge2, the trial court heard\r\ndefense counsel's objection. Defense counsel argued he did not use the word\r\n\"prostitute\" to describe Victim and claimed the solicitor's comment on the\r\ndefense's failure to present evidence was burden shifting. Defense counsel then\r\nmoved for a mistrial, moved for a curative instruction, and objected to the curative\r\ninstruction given.3 The trial court denied Meggett's mistrial motion and request for\r\na curative instruction. The trial court determined the State's comments did not shift\r\nthe burden of proof and the jury had twice been instructed that the statements of\r\ncounsel during arguments were not to be considered as evidence. Subsequently,\r\nthe jury found Meggett guilty of first-degree burglary and first-degree CSC.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n2 In its charge to the jury, the trial court instructed the jury a defendant is not\r\nrequired to prove his innocence; the State has the burden of proving guilt beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt; and Meggett's decision not to testify cannot be used against him.\r\n3 It appears defense counsel considered the trial court's jury charge to be a curative\r\ninstruction.\r\n\nMeggett was sentenced to concurrent terms of thirty years imprisonment for each\r\noffense. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n   1. Did the trial court err in denying Meggett's motion for a continuance?\r\n\r\n   2. Did the trial court err in denying Meggett's motion for a mistrial and request\r\n      for a curative instruction?\r\n\r\n   3. Did the trial court err in denying Meggett's motion for a directed verdict as\r\n      to the first-degree burglary charge?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMotion for Continuance\r\n\r\nMeggett argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance.\r\nSpecifically, Meggett maintains if he had been allowed time to have the comforter\r\nfrom his sister's home tested for Victim's DNA he could have produced critical\r\nevidence to discredit Victim's testimony regarding their relationship and prior\r\nsexual encounters. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe denial of a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt and will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion resulting\r\nin prejudice. State v. Smith, 387 S.C. 619, 622, 693 S.E.2d 415, 417 (Ct. App.\r\n2010). \"An abuse of discretion arises from an error of law or a factual conclusion\r\nthat is without evidentiary support.\" State v. Geer, 391 S.C. 179, 189, 705 S.E.2d\r\n441, 447 (Ct. App. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nWe do not believe the trial court abused its discretion in denying Meggett's motion\r\nfor a continuance.\r\n\r\n             When a motion for a continuance is based upon the\r\n             contention that counsel for the defendant has not had\r\n             time to prepare his case its denial by the trial court has\r\n             rarely been disturbed on appeal. It is axiomatic that\r\n             determination of such motions must depend upon the\r\n             particular facts and circumstances of each case.\r\n\nState v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, 454-55, 385 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1989) (quoting State v.\r\nMotley, 251 S.C. 568, 572, 164 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1968)). \"Further, a party cannot\r\ncomplain of an error which his own conduct has induced.\" Id. at 455, 385 S.E.2d\r\nat 829 (citing State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 399 (1984)).\r\nHere, nearly two years after he was arrested and seven months after he was notified\r\nthe case would be placed on the trial docket, Meggett moved for a continuance to\r\ntest the comforter. Meggett had a significant period of time to obtain the testing\r\nand his failure to do so was a result of his own inaction and not a lack of\r\npreparation time.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Meggett failed to offer any evidence or testimony to support his\r\nclaim that probative evidence might be on the comforter. Meggett failed to offer\r\nany evidence to prove the comforter was put in storage shortly after he slept on it.\r\nAdditionally, there was no evidence presented to show the comforter was not\r\nwashed or cleaned in the two years prior to trial or that it was not used by anyone\r\nelse. Accordingly, based on Meggett's inaction in attempting to obtain the\r\ncomforter prior to requesting a continuance and the lack of evidence supporting\r\nMeggett's contention that the comforter still contained important evidence, we find\r\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Meggett's continuance motion.\r\n\r\nMotion for Mistrial\r\n\r\nMeggett argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and request\r\nfor a curative instruction. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting\r\nto an error of law.\" State v. Bantan, 387 S.C. 412, 417, 692 S.E.2d 201, 203 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010). \"The granting of a motion for mistrial is an extreme measure that\r\nshould be taken only when the incident is so grievous the prejudicial effect can be\r\nremoved in no other way.\" Id. \"A mistrial should be granted only when absolutely\r\nnecessary and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice to be\r\nentitled to a mistrial.\" Id.\r\n\r\nMeggett contends the solicitor improperly commented on his right to remain silent\r\nin his closing argument. As previously noted, during the State's closing argument,\r\nthe solicitor stated\r\n\n             In case after case involving CSC, there is one singular\r\n             tactic that is employed by the defense, and I don't fault\r\n             [defense counsel] for . . . doing it, but recognize it, and\r\n             that is attack the victim. Attack the victim, call into\r\n             question - and it's fine that [defense counsel] stands up\r\n             here and goes I don't mean to say anything. He - that's\r\n             precisely what he means. Her history of medication, the\r\n             fact that she's poor, the fact that she lives in a house that\r\n             doesn't really look like a middle class home. Calls her\r\n             unstable, calls her a liar. In opening statement he\r\n             implied, although there's no evidence of this, that\r\n             somehow she's a prostitute, smear -\r\n\r\nCiting Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976), Meggett argues the solicitor's comment\r\nviolated the principle that the accused has the right to remain silent and the\r\nexercise of that right cannot be used against him. Meggett also contends the\r\nsolicitor improperly commented on Meggett's failure to present a defense. See\r\nMcFadden v. State, 342 S.C. 637, 640, 539 S.E.2d 391, 393 (2000) (holding a\r\nsolicitor must not comment, either directly or indirectly, on a defendant's silence,\r\nfailure to testify, or failure to present a defense).\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Meggett's mistrial\r\nmotion. The solicitor's statement that there was no evidence Victim was a\r\nprostitute was a comment on the evidence, or lack thereof, presented during trial.\r\nThe solicitor's comment did not improperly shift the burden of proof or suggest\r\nthat Meggett's guilt could be inferred from his failure to testify or present a\r\ndefense. The comment was made in reply to allegations defense counsel made in\r\nhis opening and closing arguments that Meggett and Victim were involved in a\r\nsex-for-money arrangement. During opening arguments, defense counsel argued\r\nto the jury that \"[V]ictim and [Meggett] struck a sort of less than desirable but\r\ninformal arrangement. They began to sleep together, and [Meggett] would forgive\r\nher debt, and it happened more than once.\" In his closing argument, defense\r\ncounsel asserted Victim was living in poor conditions and stated \"desperate times\r\ncall for desperate measures.\"\r\n\r\nThe solicitor did not state that Meggett failed to present any evidence or a defense.\r\nFurthermore, the solicitor did not suggest to the jury that an adverse inference\r\nshould be drawn against Meggett based on his failure to present evidence or testify.\r\nThe solicitor only commented on the lack of evidence presented to support the\r\ninference that Victim was a prostitute. The solicitor's remark was not improper as\r\n\nit was made to urge the jury to avoid drawing an inference not supported by the\r\nrecord. See State v. Liberte, 336 S.C. 648, 653, 521 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App.\r\n1999) (holding a solicitor is entitled to call into question the credibility of a\r\ndefense). Additionally, because we find the solicitor's comment was not improper,\r\nwe further find the trial court did not err in denying Meggett's motion for a curative\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nMeggett also argues on appeal that the solicitor's closing statement was improper\r\nbecause it injected extraneous facts and opinions into the case and appealed to the\r\njury's emotions. Because Meggett failed to raise these arguments to the trial court,\r\nthey are not preserved for our review. See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587\r\nS.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (holding an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\nMotion for Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nMeggett argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict as\r\nto the first-degree burglary charge. Specifically, Meggett contends there was no\r\nevidence he intended to commit a crime at the time he entered Victim's home. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the State, and if there is any direct evidence\r\nor any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\nthe accused, an appellate court must find that the case was properly submitted to\r\nthe jury.\" State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998).\r\n\r\nFirst-degree burglary is a statutory offense in South Carolina that is defined as\r\nfollows: \"A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a\r\ndwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling,\" and\r\nany one of several enumerated aggravating circumstances exists. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 16-11-311(A) (2003). Aggravating circumstances include entering or remaining\r\nin the dwelling at night and causing physical injury to a person not participating in\r\nthe crime. S.C. Code Ann. § 16-11-311(A)(1)(b), (3) (2003).\r\n\r\nCiting State v. Haney, 257 S.C. 89, 92, 184 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1971), Meggett\r\nargues \"inconsistent circumstances\" indicating he had a different intent or motive\r\nfor entering Victim's home other than that inferred from the crime committed are\r\npresent after his entry into Victim's home. Meggett contends the inconsistent\r\ncircumstances include: (1) he arrived at Victim's home at an unknown time\r\n\nbetween 6:00 p.m. and 12:45 a.m.; (2) he entered the unlocked doors of the house\r\nof his friend; (3) he waited for an undetermined amount of time for Victim to wake\r\nup; and (4) the first thing that happened after Victim woke up was not a rape but a\r\nconversation about the money Victim owed Meggett. According to Meggett, these\r\nspecific circumstances are inconsistent with an inference that he intended to\r\ncommit CSC the moment he crossed the threshold of Victim's home.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in denying Meggett's motion for a directed\r\nverdict as to the burglary charge. Substantial evidence was presented from which\r\nthe jury could reasonably conclude Meggett possessed the intent to commit a crime\r\nat the time he entered Victim's home. Our supreme court has examined criminal\r\nintent:      The question of the intent with which an act is done is\r\n             one of fact and is ordinarily for jury determination except\r\n             in extreme cases where there is no evidence thereon. The\r\n             intent with which an act is done denotes a state of mind,\r\n             and can be proved only by expressions or conduct,\r\n             considered in the light of the given circumstances. Intent\r\n             is seldom susceptible to proof by direct evidence and\r\n             must ordinarily be proven by circumstantial evidence,\r\n             that is, by facts and circumstances from which intent may\r\n             be inferred.\r\n\r\nState v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295, 299, 185 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971) (citing State v.\r\nJohnson, 84 S.C. 45, 65 S.E. 1023 (1909). Thus, whether a defendant possessed\r\nthe requisite intent at the time the crime was committed is typically a question for\r\njury determination because, without a statement of intent by the defendant, proof\r\nof intent must be determined by inferences from conduct. See Haney, 257 S.C. at\r\n91, 184 S.E.2d at 345. In determining whether a defendant possessed the\r\nnecessary criminal intent in a burglary case, a defendant's actions after he entered a\r\ndwelling can constitute evidence of his intent at the time of his unlawful entry.\r\nState v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000). In Pinckney,\r\nour supreme court explained this principle:\r\n\r\n             For example, if a defendant entered a house and\r\n             committed criminal sexual conduct (CSC), the jury could\r\n             find him guilty of burglary even though there may not\r\n             have been any specific evidence that at the time he\r\n             entered the house he intended to commit CSC. His\r\n\n             actions after entering the house (i.e. the commission of\r\n             the CSC) would be evidence of his reason for entering\r\n             the house and would at least support the denial of a\r\n             directed verdict motion. See e.g. State v. Faircloth, 297\r\n             N.C. 388, 255 S.E.2d 366 (1979) (citing State v. Tippett,\r\n             270 N.C. 588, 155 S.E.2d 269 (1967) (\"The intent with\r\n             which an accused broke and entered may be found by the\r\n             jury from evidence as to what he did within the house.\")).\r\n\r\nPinckney, 339 S.C. at 349-50, 529 S.E.2d at 527-28.\r\n\r\nHere, Meggett entered Victim's home at night without permission. Moments after\r\nVictim woke up Meggett briefly brought up the outstanding debt and then sexually\r\nassaulted her. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we\r\nbelieve Meggett's actions after entering Victim's home supported a reasonable\r\ninference that Meggett possessed the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry.\r\nAccordingly, the question of Meggett's criminal intent was for the jury to decide,\r\nand therefore, we affirm the trial court's denial of Meggett's motion for a directed\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4996","title":"State v.

Incident and Investigation\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of March 27, 2007, Sheldon Frasier parked his car in a North\r\nCharleston neighborhood next to Jamol Greene's truck, and the men conversed\r\nwith a mutual friend. Frasier's fiancée, Kimberly Bates, remained in the car. Soon\r\nafter Frasier and Bates arrived, a burgundy Cutlass pulled in behind the vehicles,\r\nand the driver got out. After arguing briefly with Frasier, the man produced a gun\r\nand began firing at Frasier. Bates briefly exited the car and confronted the\r\ngunman, giving Frasier the opportunity to run away. After Bates retreated, the\r\ngunman returned to the Cutlass and drove away.\r\n\r\nBates located Frasier at a home not far away. One of the bullets had pierced his\r\nneck and severed his carotid artery. Alive but bleeding profusely, Frasier denied\r\nknowing who had shot him. He died four days later.\r\n\r\nBates described the gunman to police, and as a result, on the day of the shooting,\r\nthe police presented her with a photographic lineup. However, she did not\r\nrecognize any of the men in the lineup.\r\n\r\nShortly after the incident, the police located the burgundy Cutlass not far from the\r\nscene of the shooting. Inside it, they found a business card advertising automobile\r\ndetailing by \"Nitty.\" The next day, the police learned Stephens used the nickname\r\n\"Nitty\" and presented Bates with a second photographic lineup. She identified\r\nStephens as the gunman.\r\n\r\nThe police also determined the Cutlass belonged to Greene, who provided a written\r\nstatement. Greene indicated Stephens had taken the Cutlass to wash it and\r\nidentified him as the gunman. Stephens was indicted and tried for murder.\r\n\r\nII.   Motion to Suppress\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Stephens moved to suppress Bates's identification of him in the\r\nsecond photographic lineup, arguing (1) the lineup consisted of only six\r\nphotographs; (2) the images, which were photocopies of photographs, were in\r\nblack and white and of poor quality; and (3) Bates's identification was unreliable\r\n\nbecause she viewed the gunman and the lineup during a time of very high\r\nemotional stress.\r\n\r\nThe State presented the testimony of Detective Keith Elmore, who had led the\r\ninvestigation of Frasier's shooting. He stated that after he learned Stephens used\r\nthe nickname \"Nitty,\" he asked the jail to prepare a six-photograph lineup\r\nincluding Stephens. The only identifying features Detective Elmore provided with\r\nthis request were Stephens's name and date of birth. The day after the shooting,\r\nDetective Elmore showed Bates the lineup with these instructions: \"I am just\r\ngoing to show it to you and if you see anybody pertaining to this case, whether\r\nthey were the witness, [or] had anything to do with the investigation[,] . . . circle it,\r\nsign it and tell me what their involvement was.\" Detective Elmore testified that\r\nafter Bates looked over the photographs, she pointed to Stephens and told\r\nDetective Elmore \"that's the person who shot\" Frasier. Bates circled Stephens's\r\nphotograph and signed and dated the page.\r\n\r\nBates also testified. She recalled sitting inside the car when she first saw the\r\ngunman chasing Frasier. She looked at the man for approximately ten seconds.\r\nWhen she exited the car to confront him, she looked at the gunman face to face\r\nfrom a distance of eight to ten feet for approximately five seconds. Bates stated\r\nshe did not recognize anyone in the first photographic lineup. With regard to the\r\nsecond photographic lineup, Bates described Detective Elmore handing her\r\nphotographs of six African-American men of the same approximate age and build\r\nand asking if she could identify the person who shot Frasier. Bates identified\r\nStephens as the gunman. He was the only person she identified.\r\n\r\nThe trial court denied Stephens's motion, finding \"there [was] really nothing\r\nsuggestive about the lineup\" because each of the men had \"similar features[ and]\r\nvery similar eye structure.\" In addition, the trial court observed that, while Bates\r\nwas in a very emotional state when she identified Stephens, her testimony that she\r\ndid not recognize any of the men in the first lineup suggested she made her\r\nidentification with care.\r\n\r\nIII.   Trial\r\n\r\nWhen the trial court admitted the second photographic lineup into evidence,\r\nStephens objected on the same grounds. In an off-the-record conference, he added\r\nhis contention that the \"mug shot\" itself suggested he had a prior criminal history.\r\n\nBates's trial testimony included the events surrounding the shooting and her\r\ndescriptions to the police of the Cutlass and the gunman. After relating her\r\nexperiences with the two photographic lineups, she identified Stephens as the man\r\nshe had picked out of the second lineup and the man who shot Frasier.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Charles Moore, Greene's brother, testified he was at home asleep on\r\nthe day of the shooting. Between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon, Stephens stopped\r\nby and announced he was going to wash the Cutlass. Moore recalled Stephens\r\nstayed and talked for five to ten minutes, left in the Cutlass for another five to ten\r\nminutes, and then returned to pick up a red Grand Am.\r\n\r\nIn his defense, Stephens first presented an expert witness who testified to the\r\nfallibility of human memory in eyewitness identifications. He also presented\r\nAmber Moore, sister of Greene and Moore. Amber testified she arrived home\r\nfrom school at about 3:30 p.m. on the day of the shooting and \"went straight to\r\nsleep.\" She remembered being awoken by a commotion outside and being escorted\r\nout of the house. However, her memory faltered when Stephens examined her\r\nabout a statement she gave police on the day of the shooting, indicating the Cutlass\r\nwas parked in the driveway as late as 4:00 p.m. that day.\r\n\r\nThe jury found Stephens guilty of murder, and he received a sentence of forty\r\nyears' imprisonment. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound\r\nby the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous. State v. Wilson,\r\n345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). The admission or exclusion of\r\nevidence is a matter within the trial court's sound discretion, and an appellate court\r\nmay disturb a ruling admitting or excluding evidence only upon a showing of a\r\nmanifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice. State v. Gillian,\r\n373 S.C. 601, 613, 646 S.E.2d 872, 878 (2007). \"An abuse of discretion occurs\r\nwhen the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\ncontrolled by an error of law.\" State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262,\r\n265 (2006).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\nStephens asserts the trial court erred in admitting the second photographic lineup\r\nbecause the unfairly prejudicial effect of the lineup significantly outweighed any\r\nprobative value. In particular, he argues the unfair prejudice arose from the danger\r\nthat the jury would conclude the police had his \"mug shot\" from a prior arrest. We\r\ndisagree.    A trial judge's decision regarding the comparative\r\n             probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should\r\n             be reversed only in \"exceptional circumstances.\" We\r\n             review a trial court's decision regarding Rule 403\r\n             pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are\r\n             obligated to give great deference to the trial court's\r\n             judgment. A trial judge's balancing decision under Rule\r\n             403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate\r\n             court believes it would have decided the matter otherwise\r\n             because of a differing view of the highly subjective\r\n             factors of the probative value or the prejudice presented\r\n             by the evidence. If judicial self-restraint is ever\r\n             desirable, it is when a Rule 403 analysis of a trial court is\r\n             reviewed by an appellate tribunal.\r\n\r\nState v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 357-58, 543 S.E.2d 586, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n(citations omitted), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93,\r\n107, 610 S.E.2d 494, 502 (2005).\r\n\r\n\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues,\r\nor misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or\r\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Rule 403, SCRE. \"Unfair\r\nprejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.\"\r\nState v. Lyles, 379 S.C. 328, 338, 665 S.E.2d 201, 206 (Ct. App. 2008) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). A court weighing the prejudicial effect of evidence\r\nagainst its probative value must base its determination upon the entire record and\r\nupon the particular facts of the case before it. Id.\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err in admitting the photographic lineup. At trial, Bates and\r\nDetective Elmore testified Bates identified Stephens as the gunman when she\r\nviewed the second photographic lineup the police provided her. Stephens argues\r\nthat the unfair prejudice of admitting the \"mug shot\" photograph substantially\r\n\noutweighs its probative value. He also argues that, coupled with Bates's in-court\r\nidentification of him, the introduction of the photographic lineup at trial was\r\nneedlessly cumulative. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe central theme of Stephens's defense was discrediting Bates's identification of\r\nhim in the second photographic lineup. In a pretrial motion, Stephens argued to\r\nsuppress the lineup because Bates's identification was unreliable and unduly\r\nsuggestive. During the State's case-in-chief, Stephens cross-examined Bates and\r\nDetective Elmore extensively concerning the content of the lineup and how the\r\ndetective presented it to Bates. In his defense, Stephens presented only two\r\nwitnesses. One of them was an expert who opined that stress and other factors\r\nsurrounding a crime can further compromise an already imperfect human memory,\r\nresulting in misidentification. Finally, in his closing argument, Stephens\r\ncapitalized on Bates's emotional distress and distraction at the time of the shooting,\r\nquestioned whether she accurately counted the number of shots fired, and criticized\r\nthe manner in which the photographs were presented to her.\r\n\r\nThroughout the trial, Stephens consistently attacked the reliability of Bates's\r\nidentification of him in the lineup. By doing so, he made the photographic lineup\r\nfar more important than it might otherwise have been, thereby increasing its\r\nprobative value. Only by viewing the actual lineup could the jury determine for\r\nitself whether the allegedly poor picture quality or the six-photograph format likely\r\ninfluenced Bates's identification. Before the trial court and this court, however,\r\nStephens failed to demonstrate the admission of the lineup caused him unfair\r\nprejudice that outweighed the lineup's probative value. The increased probative\r\nvalue resulting from Stephens's attacks on the reliability of Bates's identification\r\nalso means the photos were not \"needlessly\" cumulative. Accordingly, the trial\r\ncourt did not err in admitting it.\r\n\r\nStephens's remaining argument, that his \"mug shot\" in the photographic lineup\r\nimplied he had a prior criminal record, is unpersuasive on its face. Our appellate\r\ncourts have affirmed the admission of photographic lineups that were more\r\nsuggestive of a prior criminal record than the one in this case. See, e.g., State v.\r\nDenson, 269 S.C. 407, 412-13, 237 S.E.2d 761, 764 (1977) (finding no error in\r\nadmitting photographic lineup despite the fact photographs included placards that\r\nwere taped over to conceal arrest information); State v. Robinson, 274 S.C. 198,\r\n199-200, 262 S.E.2d 729, 730 (1980) (affirming admission of photographic lineup\r\ncomprised of full frontal, profile, and frontal head-and-shoulders images with\r\nwritten information blacked out); State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 338-39, 422 S.E.2d\r\n\n133, 141 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348,\r\n352 n.5, 520 S.E.2d 614, 616 n.5 (1999) (affirming admission of photographic\r\nlineup using mug shots with identifying information masked). The photographic\r\nlineup in the instant case is most similar to the lineup in State v. Ford, 334 S.C.\r\n444, 450 n.3, 513 S.E.2d 385, 388 n.3 (Ct. App. 1999), the admissibility of which\r\nwas affirmed because each photograph showed only the subject's head and neck\r\nbut no placard or clothing. Each image in Stephens's photographic lineup shows a\r\nsubject's head and neck against a blank background and bears no identifying marks\r\nas to date, location, agency, or purpose of the photograph. Each subject is wearing\r\nstreet clothes. The photographs at issue here could have come from driver's\r\nlicenses, employee identification badges, or other sources. Accordingly, the trial\r\ncourt did not err in finding Stephens's photograph did not imply Stephens had a\r\nprior criminal record.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find that, at trial, Stephens adopted a strategy of attacking the reliability of\r\nBates's identification of him in the second photographic lineup and that his strategy\r\ngreatly increased the probative value of the second photographic lineup.\r\nFurthermore, we find Stephens has not demonstrated any prejudice that outweighs\r\nthis probative value. Finally, we find nothing in Stephens's photograph implied he\r\nhad a prior criminal record. Accordingly, the trial court's decision to admit the\r\nsecond photographic lineup is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
