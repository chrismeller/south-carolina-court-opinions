James, Jr., both of \r\n  Sumter; for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Esau Heyward brought a civil \r\n  action against Samuel Christmas, a South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper, alleging \r\n  causes of action for negligence, assault and battery, and violation of 42 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1983 by using excessive force in arresting Heyward.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  Christmas a directed verdict.Â  Heyward appeals, arguing that (1) the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting Christmas a directed verdict; and (2) the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding Christmas was entitled to qualified immunity.Â  We reverse and \r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n On February 16, 1996, Heyward worked until 5:00 p.m., changed clothes, \r\n  and then went to a bar called Scottyâ€™s Shop in Pinewood, South Carolina. Heyward \r\n  drank a few beers and then asked Ronald Brunson to give him a ride home around \r\n  8:30 to 9:00 p.m.Â  Brunson left Scottyâ€™s with Heyward, and sometime during the \r\n  drive, shots were exchanged between Brunson and a Pinewood police officer.Â  \r\n  A high-speed chase ensued, and Christmas and Trooper Raffield, another highway \r\n  patrol trooper, joined the chase.Â  Brunson eventually stopped the car and surrendered \r\n  to the police.Â  Heyward remained in the car.Â  With his gun drawn, Christmas \r\n  instructed Heyward to get out of the car and raise his hands.Â  Heyward did not \r\n  comply.Â  With his gun still drawn, Christmas went to the driverâ€™s side of the \r\n  vehicle while the other two officers approached Heyward from the passenger side.Â  \r\n  From the driverâ€™s side door, Christmas reached over, grabbed Heyward, and dragged \r\n  him from the car.Â  As he was pulling Heyward from the vehicle, Christmasâ€™ drawn \r\n  gun discharged and Heyward was shot in the right leg.Â  The officers did not \r\n  find a gun in Heywardâ€™s hands.Â  \r\nHeyward filed the underlying civil action against Christmas, alleging causes \r\n  of action for negligence, assault and battery, and using excessive force in \r\n  arresting Heyward in violation of 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  Christmas moved for summary \r\n  judgment on the negligence claim, and the circuit court granted it.Â  Prior to \r\n  trial, Heyward agreed to dismiss the assault and battery claim.Â  The only issue \r\n  to go to trial was whether Christmas had used excessive force in arresting Heyward \r\n  in violation of Â§ 1983.\r\n The first witness for Heyward was Christmas.Â  Christmas admitted \r\n  the sirens from the three police cars would have made any audible instructions \r\n  to Heyward difficult to hear.Â  Christmas testified that Heywardâ€™s empty hands \r\n  came up when Christmas grabbed for him.Â  Christmas stated that Heyward did not \r\n  resist, but his weight of 120 pounds caused Christmas to stumble while pulling \r\n  Heyward out of the car.Â  Christmas was wearing gloves at the time, and when \r\n  Heywardâ€™s weight shifted, Christmas maintained that he regripped the gun and \r\n  the gun discharged.Â  Christmas kept his gun drawn because his brand new holster \r\n  had not been broken in, which made the holster stick and difficult to pull the \r\n  gun out.Â  Christmas acknowledged the normal procedure was for the officer to \r\n  stay in a protective position while ordering occupants of a car to exit one \r\n  at a time.Â  Christmas affirmed that he did not intentionally shoot Heyward.\r\nHeyward called Rick Johnson as an expert in the field of law enforcement.Â  \r\n  Johnson regarded Christmasâ€™ actions as unreasonable.Â  Johnson contended that \r\n  Christmas placed himself in jeopardy by approaching the vehicle immediately \r\n  upon the stop before taking time to assess the situation.Â  Johnson opined that \r\n  Christmas placed the other officersâ€™ lives in jeopardy by approaching and entering \r\n  the vehicle with his weapon drawn and by pulling Heyward across to the driverâ€™s \r\n  seat with one hand when the other officers were standing outside the passenger \r\n  door.Â  According to Johnson, the more reasonable approach would have been to \r\n  get in a protected position and use the police carâ€™s public announcement system \r\n  to give verbal commands to the occupant of the car.\r\nHeyward testified at trial regarding the shooting.Â  According to Heyward, \r\n  he paid Brunson five dollars to drive him home from the bar.Â  As the two began \r\n  traveling away from the bar, a police car pulled in behind them.Â  Brunson began \r\n  shooting at the police car, stating that the police were â€œmessing with him.â€Â  \r\n  Heyward asked Brunson to let him out of the vehicle, but Brunson continued to \r\n  drive.Â  When the car eventually stopped, Heyward asserted there was a lot of \r\n  noise coming from the police sirens.Â  Heyward claimed that he sat with his hands \r\n  in his lap, still buckled in his seatbelt, after the car stopped because he \r\n  panicked.Â  Heyward heard an officer yell for him to â€œhold it,â€ and to hold his \r\n  hands up. Â Heyward professed he cooperated by putting his hands up and then \r\n  recalled being pulled out of the driverâ€™s side of the car.Â  The next thing he \r\n  heard was the gun discharging.Â  Heyward said that he never had the chance to \r\n  unlatch his seatbelt prior to being hauled from the car.\r\nAfter Heywardâ€™s presentation of evidence, Christmas moved for a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  The circuit court reserved the ruling until all the evidence had been presented.\r\nTerry Proctor testified that he was on duty at the sheriffâ€™s office and was \r\n  patrolling the road on the evening of the shooting when he heard the radio call \r\n  around midnight that shots had been fired upon a Pinewood police officer in \r\n  pursuit of a car.\r\nCaptain David E. Florence attested that he was on duty at \r\n  the Sumter County Sheriffâ€™s Office when he heard the radio call regarding the \r\n  shots fired on the Pinewood police officer.Â  Florence went to the area to try \r\n  to intercept the suspect vehicle.Â  Florence pulled his vehicle in front of the \r\n  suspect vehicle and forced Brunson to stop.Â  Florence established that he and \r\n  several other officers yelled at the occupants to put their hands in the air \r\n  and exit the car.Â  Although Brunson, the driver, exited the vehicle, the passenger \r\n  did not show his hands orÂ  comply with any commands.Â  Florence approached the \r\n  passenger side of the car, and Lieutenant Bradford opened the passenger door \r\n  to try to get Heyward out of the car.Â  At that moment, Christmas went inside \r\n  the car and grabbed Heyward from the driverâ€™s side.\r\nLieutenant Anthony Bradford asserted that after the vehicle \r\n  was stopped, he walked over to the passenger side.\r\nChristmas averred that when he approached the vehicle, the \r\n  driverâ€™s side door was left open from the driverâ€™s exit.Â  He believed he had \r\n  a better view of inside the car than anyone else and could see the suspect, \r\n  Heyward, in the car.\r\nRelying on Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), \r\n  and Roy v. Inhabitants of City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691 (1st \r\n  Cir. 1994), the circuit court granted the motion for a directed verdict on the \r\n  Â§ 1983 action, finding no Fourth Amendment violation based on the objective \r\n  reasonableness standard and on qualified immunity.Â  The court found the gun \r\n  discharged accidentally, and thus the court would not consider the gun at all.Â  \r\n  The court based its decision on whether the actual seizure was unreasonable.Â  \r\n  The court found that it was not unreasonable under the circumstances for Christmas \r\n  to pull Heyward out of the car by dragging him across the driverâ€™s seat.Â  The \r\n  circuit court held that it would not consider Christmasâ€™ deviation from his \r\n  training in the directed verdict motion.Â  Heyward appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing an order granting a directed verdict, \r\n  the appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences from the \r\n  evidence in a light most favorable to the party against whom the directed verdict \r\n  was granted.Â  Carson v. Adgar, 326 S.C. 212, 216, 486 S.E.2d 3, 5 (1997); \r\n  Adams v. G.J. Creel and Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, \r\n  85 (1995).Â  If the evidence is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, \r\n  a jury issue is created and â€œthe court may not grant a directed verdict.â€Â  Hunley \r\n  v. Gibson, 313 S.C. 350, 351, 437 S.E.2d 554, 555 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting a directed \r\n  verdict to Christmas on the ground that his conduct was objectively reasonable?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting a directed verdict on \r\n  the ground that Christmas was entitled to qualified immunity?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Objectively Reasonable Standard\r\nHeyward first argues the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  a directed verdict based on the finding that Christmasâ€™ actions were â€œobjectively \r\n  reasonable.â€Â  We agree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects \r\n  citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  Congress \r\n  enacted 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 to allow citizens a private cause of action against \r\n  state actors who deprive them of a constitutional right.Â  Section 1983 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n[Anyone] who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \r\n  custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, \r\n  or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person \r\n  within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, \r\n  or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party \r\n  injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for \r\n  redress. . . .Â Â  \r\n\r\n42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 (1996).Â  \r\nHeyward argues he was entitled to redress under \r\n  Â§ 1983 because Christmas violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using unreasonable \r\n  force in arresting him.Â  â€œBecause the Fourth Amendment provides an explicit \r\n  textual source of constitutional protection against [excessive force], that \r\n  Amendment, not the more generalized notion of â€˜substantive due process,â€™ must \r\n  be the guide for analyzing these claims.â€Â  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. \r\n  386, 395 (1989).Â  Thus, a claim that a police officer has used excessive force \r\n  during a seizure of a person must be evaluated under the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s \r\n  objective reasonableness standard.Â  Graham, 490 U.S. at 388; Threlkeld \r\n  v. White Castle Systems, Inc., 201 F.Supp.2d 834, 840 (N.D.Ill. 2002).Â  \r\n  â€œDetermining whether the force used to effect a particular seizure is â€˜reasonableâ€™ \r\n  under the Fourth Amendment requires careful balancing of â€œâ€˜the nature and quality \r\n  of the intrusion on the individualâ€™s Fourth Amendment interestsâ€™â€ against the \r\n  countervailing governmental interests at stake.â€Â  Graham, 490 U.S. at \r\n  396; accord Jackson v. City of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 651 (9th \r\n  Cir. 2001) (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 396).Â  Although the Fourth Amendment \r\n  recognizes that police have the right to use some force in making an arrest, \r\n  courts must look to the totality of the circumstances and determine whether \r\n  the use of force was â€œreasonableâ€ from the perspective of a reasonable officer \r\n  in the same situation.Â  Graham, 490 U.S. at 396; Jensen v. City of \r\n  Oxnard, 145 F.3d 1078, 1086 (9th Cir. 1998); Wicker v. City \r\n  of Galveston, 944 F.Supp. 553, 558 (S.D.Tex. 1996).Â  Factors to consider \r\n  in determining reasonableness are â€œthe facts and circumstances of each particular \r\n  case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses \r\n  an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he \r\n  is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.â€Â  Graham, \r\n  490 U.S. at 396.\r\n\r\n[T]he question is whether the officersâ€™ actions are â€œobjectively \r\n  reasonableâ€ in light of the facts and circumstancesÂ  confronting them, without \r\n  regard to their underlying intent or motivation. . . . An officerâ€™s evil intentions \r\n  will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable \r\n  use of force; nor will an officerâ€™s good intentions make an objectively unreasonable \r\n  use of force constitutional.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 397; accord Jensen, \r\n  145 F.3d at 1086; Anderson v. Branen, 17 F.3d 552, 559 (2nd \r\n  Cir. 1994).Â  \r\nBecause the intent of the officer is irrelevant \r\n  in the overall analysis of whether the officerâ€™s actions were â€œobjectively reasonable,â€ \r\n  whether a gun discharges accidentally is of no consequence.Â  A court must instead \r\n  determine whether the use of the gun was objectively reasonable in light of \r\n  the surrounding circumstances.Â  See Graham, 490 U.S. at 396 (court \r\n  must consider whether police officerâ€™s use of force was reasonable under the \r\n  circumstances); Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 598-99 (1989) \r\n  (it is not practicable to conduct an inquiry into subjective intent; it is enough \r\n  for a seizure that â€œa person be stopped by the very instrumentality set in motion \r\n  or put in place in order to achieve that resultâ€).\r\nThe circuit court in the underlying case relied \r\n  heavily upon Roy v. Inhabitants of City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691 (1st \r\n  Cir. 1994).Â  In Roy, two police officers watched as a third officer attempted \r\n  to serve the intoxicated Roy with a summons outside his home.Â  Roy refused the \r\n  summons, became angry, entered his home, and returned outside with two steak \r\n  knives, which he swung about while advancing upon the officers.Â  After unsuccessfully \r\n  attempting to get Roy to drop the knives, Roy lunged at an officer who shot \r\n  Roy twice.Â  The First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of summary judgment to the officer, finding that â€œin our view a jury could not \r\n  find that his conduct was so deficient that no reasonable officer could have \r\n  made the same choice as [the officer] â€“ in circumstances that were assuredly \r\n  â€˜tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving. . . .â€™â€Â  Roy, 42 F.3d at 695 \r\n  (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 397).Â  \r\nRoy is factually distinguishable from the present \r\n  case.Â  Whereas Roy was proceeding upon the officers while flailing about two \r\n  steak knives, Christmas approached a motionless Heyward with his gun drawn from \r\n  the driverâ€™s side of the vehicle.Â  Although Heyward eventually raised his hands, \r\n  Christmas continued to point his weapon at Heyward.Â  Despite the fact that other \r\n  officers were attempting to remove Heyward from the passenger side of the car, \r\n  Christmas grabbed Heyward, who was still wearing a seatbelt, with one hand and \r\n  lugged him across the seat of the car while still pointing his firearm with \r\n  the other hand.Â  Christmas, as a result, was also pointing the firearm at the \r\n  other officers.Â  \r\nApplying the Graham factors to the present case, \r\n  the original crime of shooting at a police officer was serious and the officers \r\n  were not initially sure which suspect in the car was the shooter.Â  However, \r\n  Heyward posed no immediate threat to the police officers when he was removed \r\n  from the vehicle because he complied with the officersâ€™ requests to make his \r\n  hands visible just prior to Christmasâ€™ seizure of him.Â  Moreover, he was not \r\n  actively resisting arrest or trying to flee.Â  \r\nFurther, the circuit court erred by refusing to consider \r\n  the other circumstances in determining whether Christmasâ€™ actions were objectively \r\n  reasonable.Â  The circuit court specifically refused to consider the use of the \r\n  weapon in effectuating the seizure of Heyward because it found the resulting \r\n  shot accidental.Â  In addition, it does not appear the circuit court considered \r\n  the other officers within the line of fire or Heywardâ€™s act of surrender by \r\n  putting his hands up prior to Christmasâ€™ actions.Â  An expert testified that \r\n  Christmasâ€™ actions were not reasonable under the circumstances.Â  Viewing the \r\n  totality of the circumstances, there was some evidence that Christmasâ€™ actions \r\n  could be considered objectively unreasonable.Â  Thus, reviewing the evidence \r\n  in this case in the light most favorable to Heyward, we find the evidence was \r\n  capable of more than one interpretation and the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  a directed verdict.\r\nII. QUALIFIED \r\n  IMMUNITY\r\nHeyward argues the circuit court erred in directing a verdict \r\n  for Christmas on the grounds that he was entitled to qualified immunity.Â  We \r\n  agree. \r\nWhile Â§ 1983 provides individuals with a method of seeking \r\n  monetary compensation against state actors who deprive them of a constitutional \r\n  right, state actors are given some protection.Â  Government officials â€œperforming \r\n  discretionary functions generally are granted a qualified immunity and are â€˜shielded \r\n  from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly \r\n  established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person \r\n  would have known.â€™â€Â  Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999) (citing \r\n  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)); see also Todd v. \r\n  Smith, 305 S.C. 227, 238, 407 S.E.2d 644, 650 (1991) (quoting Harlow).Â  \r\n  â€œ[T]he first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been \r\n  violated on the facts alleged; second, assuming the violation is established, \r\n  the question whether the right was clearly established must be considered on \r\n  a more specific level. . . .â€Â  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001).Â  \r\n  â€œThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly \r\n  established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct \r\n  was unlawful in the situation he confronted.â€Â  Id. at 202 (citing Wilson, \r\n  526 U.S. at 615). \r\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has summarized this \r\n  test as follows:\r\n\r\nRuling on a defense of qualified immunity therefore requires \r\n  (1) identification of the specific right allegedly violated; (2) determining \r\n  whether at the time of the alleged violation the right was clearly established; \r\n  and (3) if so, then determining whether a reasonable person in the officer's \r\n  position would have known that doing what he did would violate that right. The \r\n  first two of these present pure questions of law for the courts.Â  Harlow, \r\n  457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738.Â  The third, which involves application of \r\n  Harlowâ€™s objective test to the particular conduct at issue, may require \r\n  factual determinations respecting disputed aspects of that conduct.Â  Anderson \r\n  v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 646 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3042 n. 6 (1987).\r\n\r\nPritchett v. Alford, 973 F.2d 307, 312 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1992).\r\nAt the end of the trial, the circuit court announced an \r\n  inclination to grant Christmas a directed verdict based on â€œboth the objective \r\n  reasonable standards on the Fourth Amendment test and qualified immunity.â€Â  \r\n  However, throughout the directed verdict arguments with counsel, the circuit \r\n  court only discussed the objective reasonable standard.Â  The circuit court did \r\n  not discuss why, based on the facts presented, it found Christmas was entitled \r\n  to qualified immunity.Â  It does not appear from the record that the circuit \r\n  court performed a qualified immunity evaluation.Â  \r\nNevertheless, it appears that Heyward presented evidence \r\n  that would create a question of fact regarding qualified immunity.Â  Heyward \r\n  was entitled under the Fourth Amendment to be free from seizures effectuated \r\n  by the use of excessive force.Â  This right was clearly established at the time \r\n  Christmas approached the motionless Heyward with his gun drawn.Â  Finally, some \r\n  evidence was presented that a reasonable officer would not have approached Heyward \r\n  in the manner that Christmas did.Â  The expert testimony at trial at least created \r\n  a question of fact regarding the reasonableness of Christmasâ€™ actions.Â  Because \r\n  the circuit court failed to make a reasoned evaluation of whether Christmas \r\n  was entitled to qualified immunity and Heyward presented evidence which could \r\n  lead to more than one inference regarding Christmasâ€™ entitlement to qualified \r\n  immunity, the circuit court erred in granting Christmas a directed verdict based \r\n  on qualified immunity.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a directed \r\n  verdict to Christmas is \r\nREVERSED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR TRIAL.\r\nCONNOR and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3563","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Tara S. Taggart, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.:Â  The Circuit Court found Victor Wyatt Missouri \r\n  had â€œstandingâ€ to challenge the drug evidence introduced against him based on \r\n  a violation of the Fourth Amendment.Â  The State appeals, arguing Missouri did \r\n  not have â€œstandingâ€ to challenge the drug evidence.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn early 1995, Greenville detectives were investigating \r\n  a crack cocaine ring.Â  On February 3, 1995, the police obtained a warrant to \r\n  search the apartment of Curtis Sibert for cocaine.Â  When the police executed \r\n  the search warrant, they found Missouri in the kitchen standing over a sink, \r\n  facing a set of triple beam scales.Â  The police discovered a quantity of cooked, \r\n  crack cocaine inside the sink.Â  Missouri was arrested and charged with trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine.\r\nAt trial, the lead detective admitted he lied in the affidavit issued \r\n  in support of the search warrant.Â  Further, according to Missouri, the affidavit \r\n  omitted exculpatory information.Â  The Circuit Court denied Missouriâ€™s motion \r\n  to suppress the evidence obtained in the search.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed \r\n  the Circuit Court, ruling the omitted information was necessary for the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  finding of probable cause.Â  This Court remanded the matter for a hearing to \r\n  determine whether Missouri had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment.Â  \r\n  State v. Missouri, 97-UP-448 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 15, 1997).Â  \r\n  The Supreme Court affirmed.Â  State v. Missouri, 337 S.C. 548, 524 S.E.2d \r\n  394 (1999).\r\nA hearing was held before the Circuit Court on \r\n  remand to determine whether Missouri had a reasonable expectation of privacy \r\n  in the apartment.Â  Sibert, Missouriâ€™s best friend, testified that in 1994 and \r\n  1995, Missouri was an occasional overnight guest at Sibertâ€™s apartment â€œwhenever \r\n  [Missouri] got to arguing with his wife,â€ whenever Sibertâ€™s wife would leave \r\n  for the weekend, and whenever Missouri and Sibert would sneak away to â€œgo partying.â€Â  \r\n  Sibert stated that Missouri kept a change of clothing at Sibertâ€™s apartment \r\n  so Missouri could â€œgo partyingâ€ with Sibert without Missouriâ€™s â€œwifeâ€ finding \r\n  out.Â  Missouri would stay in Sibertâ€™s sonâ€™s room whenever he spent the night.\r\nOn certain occasions, Sibert would give Missouri \r\n  a key to the apartment.Â  Sibert declared that Missouri had a key to the apartment \r\n  at the time of Missouriâ€™s arrest.Â  According to Sibert, Missouri went to the \r\n  apartment as a friend, not as a business associate, when Sibert was not there.Â Â  \r\n  Sibert left Missouri in control of the apartment when he was gone, with the \r\n  ability to let people come and go as Missouri saw fit.Â  Because Sibertâ€™s wife \r\n  was trying to â€œkickâ€ her drug addiction, Sibert testified that he would not \r\n  have left Missouri in his apartment the day the search warrant was executed \r\n  if he had known Missouri intended to mix the drugs there.\r\nSibert admitted on cross-examination that he returned \r\n  to his apartment at 1:00 a.m. the night before the search warrant was executed \r\n  and Missouri was not staying there.Â  He did not recall the exact date when Missouri \r\n  last spent the night at his apartment.Â  Sibert professed he was not in the drug \r\n  business and that he had no idea what Missouri was planning to do in his apartment \r\n  when he left Missouri there the day the search warrant was executed.\r\nSibertâ€™s wife testified Missouri had a key to the apartment, he left a change \r\n  of clothing there, and he had control of the apartment when she and Sibert were \r\n  gone.\r\nAt the hearing, Missouri stated he was close friends with Sibert \r\n  and had known him for many years.Â  He occasionally spent the night at Sibertâ€™s \r\n  apartment.Â  Missouri declared that he was free to come and go from Sibertâ€™s \r\n  apartment and would sometimes use the key Sibert had given him.Â  Although Missouri \r\n  had his own residence a few miles from Sibertâ€™s apartment, Missouri would stay \r\n  at the apartment whenever he was arguing with his fiancÃ©e or whenever he wanted \r\n  to get out of the house.Â  Missouri stayed in Sibertâ€™s sonâ€™s room and he kept \r\n  a change of clothes there.Â  However, Missouri admitted that he did not spend \r\n  the night at Sibertâ€™s apartment the night before the search warrant was executed.Â  \r\n  Missouri denied that he and Sibert had a business relationship regarding drug \r\n  trafficking. \r\nThe State presented the testimony of Detective Eric Cureton, the officer responsible \r\n  for the false statements in the affidavit supporting the search warrant.Â  Cureton \r\n  was conducting surveillance on Sibertâ€™s apartment the day the warrant was executed.Â  \r\n  On that day, he observed Missouri enter the apartment between 2:30 and 3:00 \r\n  p.m. and did not see any other person enter or exit the apartment.Â  The search \r\n  warrant was executed between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m., after Sibert called the confidential \r\n  informant to inform him that it was time to â€œcome and get it.â€\r\nCureton monitored Sibert and his wife purchasing baking soda at different locations \r\n  around town earlier that day.Â  Baking soda is used to aid in the cooking process, \r\n  which turns cocaine into crack cocaine.Â  Upon executing the warrant, \r\n  Cureton discovered Missouri in the kitchen standing over several dishes of cooling \r\n  crack cocaine.Â  Sibert and his wife were sitting on the couch with the television \r\n  on.Â  The police examined Missouriâ€™s key chain.Â  It held three keys: one to Missouriâ€™s \r\n  residence, and two keys to two cars.Â  The key chain did not contain a key to \r\n  Sibertâ€™s apartment.Â  In the kitchen, Cureton recovered a black bag belonging \r\n  to Missouri and containing scales and packaging paper.Â  No other items belonging \r\n  to Missouri were found in the apartment. \r\nOn cross-examination, Cureton professed he was â€œconfusedâ€ and an \r\n  inexperienced police officer when he drafted the original affidavit in support \r\n  of the search warrant.Â  Cureton admitted he was not familiar with Missouriâ€™s \r\n  clothes and did not know whether Missouriâ€™s clothes were in Sibertâ€™s apartment.Â  \r\n  Although Cureton checked the keys on Missouriâ€™s key ring, he returned the keys \r\n  to Missouri after he was booked.Â  Cureton was not aware of the friendship between \r\n  Missouri and the Siberts.\r\n Detective James Bradley testified that, upon executing the search \r\n  warrant, he found Missouri in the kitchen with cooked crack cocaine.Â  Bradley \r\n  did not find any items in the apartment belonging to Missouri.Â  When Missouri \r\n  was searched, â€œsome keysâ€ were â€œtaken off of him.â€Â  The keys went to a van, \r\n  another car, and Missouriâ€™s residence.\r\n Missouri testified in reply regarding the keys.Â  He stated he had \r\n  more than three keys on his key chain. \r\nThe Circuit Court determined that Missouri and Sibert were close, \r\n  long-time friends and Missouri visited Sibert frequently at Sibertâ€™s apartment.Â  \r\n  Missouri sometimes spent the night at Sibertâ€™s, but did not live with Sibert.Â  \r\n  The court found Missouri had access to the apartment, on some occasions had \r\n  a key to the apartment, and was free to come and go as he pleased from the apartment.Â  \r\n  Further, the court noted the Siberts did not charge Missouri to stay at their \r\n  apartment, he kept a change of clothes there, and Missouri used the apartment \r\n  as a place to â€œâ€˜get away.â€™â€Â  The court specifically found Missouri did not spend \r\n  the night at the apartment the evening prior to the execution of the search \r\n  warrant.Â  Finally, the court concluded that, on the day the search warrant was \r\n  issued, the police began surveillance of the Sibertsâ€™ apartment at 7:00 a.m.; \r\n  Missouri arrived between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m.; the Siberts left Missouri at their \r\n  apartment while they went shopping; the search warrant was executed between \r\n  9:30 and 10:00 p.m.; and the officers discovered Missouri in the kitchen with \r\n  crack cocaine and the Siberts in another room.\r\n Based on the factual findings, the Circuit Court held that Missouri \r\n  had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment and he would \r\n  therefore be able to challenge the search under the Fourth Amendment. \r\n  [1] \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  \r\n  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Cutter, \r\n  261 S.C. 140, 199 S.E.2d 61 (1973).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, \r\n  338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).\r\nOur Supreme Court articulated the proper standard of review in regard \r\n  to a Fourth Amendment issue relating to search and seizure:\r\n\r\nAs a threshold matter, we must determine the appropriate \r\n  standard of review to apply in considering the trial courtâ€™s ruling below. . \r\n  . . The test for making this determination entails an inquiry into the totality \r\n  of the circumstances. . . . .\r\n. . . .\r\nTherefore, we will review the trial courtâ€™s ruling like \r\n  any other factual finding and reverse if there is clear error.Â  We will affirm \r\n  if there is any evidence to support the ruling.\r\n\r\nState v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 65-66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 665-66 (2000).Â  \r\n  We find the Brockman standard of review is controlling.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution elucidates:\r\n\r\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \r\n  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be \r\n  violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by \r\n  oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and \r\n  the persons or things to be seized.\r\n\r\nU.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  The South Carolina Constitution provides similar protection \r\n  against unlawful searches and seizures.Â  See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  \r\n  Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in both \r\n  state and federal court.Â  See Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. \r\n  1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 \r\n  S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914); State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 \r\n  S.E.2d 837 (2001); State v. Austin, 306 S.C. 9, 409 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991).\r\nFourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional \r\n  rights, may not be vicariously asserted.Â  See Alderman v. United States, \r\n  394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969); Rakas v. Illinois, \r\n  439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978).Â  Thus, a person seeking to \r\n  have evidence suppressed based upon a Fourth Amendment violation â€œmust establish \r\n  that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violatedâ€ by the search and seizure.Â  \r\n  State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 114-15, 352 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1987) (citing \r\n  United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 \r\n  (1980)); see also Rakas, 439 U.S. at 138, 99 S.Ct. at 428, \r\n  58 L.Ed.2d at 398 (â€œâ€˜rights assured by the Fourth Amendment are personal rights, \r\n  [which] . . . may be enforced by exclusion of evidence only at the instance \r\n  of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizureâ€™â€).\r\nIt is not necessary for a defendant to be an owner of a property in order to \r\n  claim Fourth Amendment rights.Â  State v. Daniels, 252 S.C. 591, 167 S.E.2d \r\n  621 (1969).Â  However, a defendant seeking to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment \r\n  grounds bears the burden of proving he had a reasonable expectation of privacy \r\n  in the area searched or the item seized.Â  United States v. Rusher, 966 \r\n  F.2d 868 (4th Cir. 1992) (citing Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, 100 \r\n  S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980)); McKnight, 291 S.C. at 115, 352 S.E.2d \r\n  at 473.Â  â€œA subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate if it is one that \r\n  society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.â€Â  Minnesota v. Olson, \r\n  495 U.S. 91, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 1687, 109 L.Ed.2d 85, 92 (1990) (internal \r\n  quotations omitted).\r\nIn determining whether a particular defendant may challenge a search and seizure, \r\n  the United States Supreme Court has indicated a preference for an analysis focusing \r\n  on â€œthe extent of a particular defendantâ€™s rights under the Fourth Amendment, \r\n  rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined concept \r\n  of standing.â€Â  Rakas, 439 U.S. at 139, 99 S.Ct. at 428, 58 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  398; see also State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 76-77, 276 S.E.2d 163, \r\n  165 (1981) (â€œthe United States Supreme Court has recently shifted away from \r\n  a â€˜standingâ€™ approach to an inquiry focusing directly on the substantive issue \r\n  of whether the claimant possessed a â€˜legitimate expectation of privacyâ€™ in the \r\n  area searched.â€).\r\nWhether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a \r\n  particular premises depends on the status of the defendant.Â  The Fourth Amendment \r\n  offers more protection to an overnight guest than to one who is merely a casual \r\n  guest or conducting a business transaction.Â  In Minnesota v. Olson, 495 \r\n  U.S. 91, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990), police entered a residence, \r\n  without a warrant, to apprehend an overnight guest who was a suspect in a murder \r\n  and robbery.Â  The Supreme Court found the defendantâ€™s status as an overnight \r\n  guest alone was â€œenough to show that he had an expectation of privacy in the \r\n  home that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.â€Â  Olson, 495 \r\n  U.S. at 96-97, 110 S.Ct. at 1688, 109 L.Ed.2d at 93.\r\nBy contrast, in Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 119 S.Ct. \r\n  469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998), two defendants were in the apartment of the lessee \r\n  for the sole purpose of packaging cocaine.Â  The two defendants paid the lessee \r\n  of the apartment one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine for the two and one-half \r\n  hours they used the apartment.Â  There was no indication that the two defendants \r\n  had a prior relationship with the lessee of the apartment.Â  The Supreme Court \r\n  held that, unlike the overnight guest in Olson, the two defendants in \r\n  Carter had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment because \r\n  they were guests â€œsimply permitted on the premisesâ€ and were present solely \r\n  for a business transaction.Â  Carter, 525 U.S. at 91, 119 S.Ct. at 474, \r\n  142 L.Ed.2d at 381.\r\nThe facts in the present case are more akin to those found in Carter.Â  \r\n  Missouri clearly had a long relationship with Sibert and had periodically been \r\n  an overnight guest in Sibertâ€™s apartment with the occasional use of a key to \r\n  the apartment.Â  When Missouri spent the night with Sibert, he was free to come \r\n  and go as he pleased.Â  However, Missouri was not an overnight guest the evening \r\n  before the search warrant was executed.Â  Moreover, he had only been present \r\n  at Sibertâ€™s apartment for a few hours.Â  Despite Missouriâ€™s testimony that he \r\n  kept clothes in the apartment and that he had a key, neither his clothes nor \r\n  a key was found.Â  The major purpose of Missouriâ€™s presence was to cook cocaine \r\n  into crack cocaine.\r\nWe find Missouriâ€™s occasional status as an overnight guest did not extend to \r\n  this instance where he was merely a permittee on the premises.Â  Further, as \r\n  he was assisting Sibert with the manufacture of crack cocaine, Missouriâ€™s main \r\n  purpose for being on the premises was for â€œbusinessâ€ reasons.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Missouri had no reasonable expectation of privacy.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  he did not have â€œstandingâ€ to assert a violation of the Fourth Amendment.Â  \r\n  We rule that, at the time the search warrant was executed, Missouri was merely \r\n  a permitted guest conducting business, not an overnight guest entitled to Fourth \r\n  Amendment protection.Â  We REVERSE the Circuit Courtâ€™s finding that Missouri \r\n  had â€œstandingâ€ to assert a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\r\n REVERSED.\r\n STILWELL, J., concurs.\r\nCONNOR, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n Connor, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent \r\n  and would affirm the trial judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  I believe Missouri had a legitimate \r\n  expectation of privacy in the Sibertsâ€™ apartment.Â Â  \r\nAs noted by the majority, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on this issue can only be \r\n  reversed if there is clear error. If any evidence supports the ruling, it will \r\n  be affirmed.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 65-66, 528 S.E.2d 661, \r\n  665-66 (2000); State v. Williams, Op. No. 3550 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. \r\n  9, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32 at 66).\r\nThe majority opinion outlines the numerous findings \r\n  of fact made by the trial judge. After observing all of the witnesses, the trial \r\n  judge found Missouri had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises \r\n  searched.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge specifically found that Missouri and \r\n  Curtis Sibert were â€œgood friendsâ€ and had grown up together, and that Missouri \r\n  frequently visited the Sibertsâ€™ apartment, sometimes spending the night. Moreover, \r\n  he found that Missouri on â€œsome occasionsâ€ had a key to the apartment and kept \r\n  a change of clothes there.Â  He also found the Siberts did not charge Missouri \r\n  to use the apartment.Â  \r\nHowever, the majority makes its own findings of fact, \r\n  some contrary to those made by the trial judge.Â  The majority characterizes \r\n  Missouriâ€™s relationship with the Siberts as that of an â€œoccasionalâ€ or â€œperiodicalâ€ \r\n  overnight guest.Â  Furthermore, the majority finds â€œneither [Missouriâ€™s] clothes \r\n  nor a key was foundâ€ in the apartment.Â  It also states the main purpose of Missouriâ€™s \r\n  presence at the apartment was for â€œbusinessâ€ reasons. \r\nThe United States Supreme Court, in Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91 \r\n  (1990), held an overnight guest had a reasonable expectation of privacy. [2] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn the other hand, in Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83 (1998), the Court \r\n  addressed â€œthe issue of whether a person present in anotherâ€™s home for a â€˜purely \r\n  commercial . . . transaction,â€™ for only a â€˜relatively short period of time,â€™ \r\n  and having no â€˜previous relationship withâ€™ the householder, could claim the \r\n  Fourth Amendmentâ€™s protections.â€Â  Morton v. United States, 734 A.2d 178, \r\n  180 (D.C. 1999) (quoting Carter, 525 U.S. at 91).Â  The Court said such \r\n  person did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. \r\nIn Carter, the Court held there was nothing â€œsimilar to the overnight \r\n  guest relationship in Olson to suggest a degree of acceptance into the \r\n  household.â€Â  Carter, 525 U.S. at 90.Â  TheÂ  Court further stated: â€œIf \r\n  we regard the overnight guest in Minnesota v. Olson as typifying those \r\n  who may claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment in the home of another, \r\n  and one merely â€˜legitimately on the premisesâ€™ as typifying those who may not \r\n  do so, the present case is obviously somewhere in between.â€Â  Carter, \r\n  525 U.S. at 91. [3] Â Â Â  \r\nI believe this case is more like Olson than \r\n  Carter.Â  In Carter there was â€œno suggestion that [the defendants] \r\n  had a previous relationship with [the householder], or that there was any other \r\n  purpose to their visit.â€Â  Carter, 525 U.S. at 90.Â  In this case Missouri \r\n  and Sibert were good friends, and Missouri had visited the apartment on a frequent \r\n  basis, sometimes spending the night. Missouri was free to come and go as he \r\n  pleased and paid nothing to use the apartment.Â  Missouri had a change of clothes \r\n  at the apartment and on some occasions had a key.Â  He used the apartment as \r\n  a place to â€œget awayâ€ and as a place to â€œfind comfort.â€Â  On the day the warrant \r\n  was executed, Missouri had been at the apartment for approximately seven hours. \r\n  Additionally, when left alone at the apartment, Missouri could control who came \r\n  and entered the apartment.Â Â  \r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact support his ruling \r\n  that Missouri had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the apartment.Â  This \r\n  ruling is clearly supported by the evidence. Therefore the trial judge should \r\n  be affirmed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The court used the term â€œstanding.â€Â  The United States Supreme Court has indicated \r\n    a preference for an evaluation of the substantive Fourth Amendment right.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, we will interchange this term for â€œstandingâ€ throughout this \r\n    opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â Â  In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized \r\n    the facts of Olson were similar to those in Jones v. United States, \r\n    362 U.S. 257 (1960).Â  Olson, 495 U.S. at 97.Â  Jones is likewise \r\n    instructive in the present case.Â  The defendant in Jones sought to \r\n    challenge a search warrant after being arrested in a friendâ€™s apartment.Â  \r\n    Jones testified that â€œthe apartment belonged to a friend . . . who had given \r\n    him the use of it, and a key, with which [Jones] had admitted himself on the \r\n    day of the arrest.â€Â  Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 259 (1960), \r\n    overruled in part by United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83 \r\n    (1980) (rejecting the â€œautomatic standingâ€ rule based on possession of seized \r\n    goods established in Jones).Â  Jones also testified he had clothing \r\n    in the apartment, â€œthat his home was elsewhere, that he paid nothing for the \r\n    use of the apartment, that [his friend] had let him use it â€˜as a friend,â€™ \r\n    [and] that he had slept there â€˜maybe a night[.]â€™â€Â  Id.Â  The Court ruled \r\n    Jones could challenge the search because he was â€œlegitimately on [the] premises.â€Â  \r\n    Although this particular standard has been repudiated, the Court stated it \r\n    did â€œnot question the conclusion in Jones that the defendant in that \r\n    case suffered a violation of his personal Fourth Amendment rights if the search \r\n    in question was unlawful.â€Â  Rakas v.

(Daisy) appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the Administrative \r\n  Law Judgeâ€™s (ALJâ€™s) order upholding the South Carolina Department of Transportationâ€™s \r\n  (SCDOTâ€™s) revocation of two permits for outdoor advertising signs.Â  We affirm. \r\n   [1] \r\nFACT AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDaisy applied for permits for \r\n  two outdoor advertising signs to be located along I-26 in Spartanburg County \r\n  in November of 1998.Â  As the signs were to be located in an area without zoning, \r\n  Daisy was required to identify a qualifying business within 600 feet of the \r\n  sign sites.Â  The applications listed Quick Response Fire Systems as the qualifying \r\n  business.Â  On March 31, 1999, SCDOT informed Daisy that the applications had \r\n  been approved.\r\nIn May of 1999, Quick Response \r\n  ceased its operations at this location.Â  By August of 1999, it had vacated the \r\n  location, the power had been disconnected, and a â€œFor Leaseâ€ sign had been placed \r\n  in front of the building.Â  In November of 1999, SCDOT informed Daisy that it \r\n  was canceling the permits for the signs.\r\nDaisy appealed to the ALJ.Â  The \r\n  ALJ found SCDOT had established by prima facie evidence that Quick Responseâ€™s \r\n  activities at the location were a sham as defined in 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. \r\n  63-342 (U) (Supp. 2001).Â  He then found Daisy failed to overcome SCDOTâ€™s prima \r\n  facie case that Quick Response was primarily situated at this location to qualify \r\n  the sign site and failed to establish that there was any meaningful business \r\n  conducted at Quick Response for the requisite one-year period after the approval \r\n  of the applications.Â  Daisy appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the \r\n  ALJ.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review for a court reviewing the decision \r\n  of an ALJ is set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (D) (Supp. 2001) of the \r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA).Â  The court may not substitute its judgment \r\n  for that of the ALJ on questions of fact when those facts are supported by substantial \r\n  evidence.Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000).Â  \r\n  Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that, considering the record as a \r\n  whole, a reasonable mind would accept to support the ALJâ€™s decision.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  It exists when, if the case were presented to a jury, the court would refuse \r\n  to direct a verdict because the evidence raises questions of fact for the jury.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence, \r\n  but is something less than the weight of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does \r\n  not prevent a court from concluding that substantial evidence supports the ALJâ€™s \r\n  finding.Â  Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDaisy argues the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order should be reversed because the ALJ erred in upholding SCDOTâ€™s revocation \r\n  of the sign permits.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the Highway Advertising Control Act, \r\n  the General Assembly acknowledged that outdoor advertising is â€œa business which \r\n  must be allowed to exist and operate where other business and commercial activities \r\n  are conducted and that a reasonable use of property for outdoor advertising \r\n  to the traveling public is desirable.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-130 (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n  However, the General Assembly also recognized that the erection and maintenance \r\n  of outdoor advertising signs adjacent to the interstate and federal-aid primary \r\n  systems must be regulated.Â  Id.Â  Thus, it granted SCDOT the authority \r\n  to issue permits for the erection and maintenance of the signs and to promulgate \r\n  regulations governing the issuance of the permits.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-150(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2001). \r\nGenerally, the Highway Advertising Control \r\n  Act limits the placement of commercial outdoor advertising signs to zoned industrial \r\n  areas, zoned commercial areas, unzoned commercial areas, or unzoned industrial \r\n  areas.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-140(7) &amp; (8) (Supp. 2001).Â  An unzoned commercial \r\n  or industrial area is defined as â€œthe land occupied by the regularly used building, \r\n  parking lot, and storage and processing area of a commercial, business, or industrial \r\n  activity and land within six hundred feet of it on both sides of the highway.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-120 (4) (Supp. 2001).Â  Such an area does not include \r\n  an area occupied by â€œsham activities.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-342(FF)(4) \r\n  (Supp. 2001).Â  A sham activity is defined as:\r\n\r\nany activity that is seemingly \r\n  a commercial or industrial activity but which was created primarily or exclusively \r\n  to qualify an area as an unzoned commercial or industrial area and which does \r\n  not conduct any meaningful business at the activity site.Â  Failure of an activity \r\n  to maintain the standards set forth under the definition of transient and temporary \r\n  [2]  within one year after a sign permit was issued based on the activity \r\n  qualifying the sign site as an unzoned commercial or industrial area shall be \r\n  prima facie evidence that the activity was a sham.\r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-342(U) \r\n  (Supp. 2001).Â  Â  If an activity is subsequently determined to be a sham activity, \r\n  the sign permitted under this activity shall be illegal and must be removed \r\n  at the sign ownerâ€™s or landownerâ€™s expense.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-344(G) \r\n  (Supp. 2001).\r\nDaisy acknowledges in its brief that Quick Response ceased its operations \r\n  less than one year after the permit approval, and thus, SCDOT established a \r\n  prima facie case that Quick Response was a sham activity.Â  Once a party establishes \r\n  a prima facie case, the burden of proof shifts to the opposing party.Â  Hadfield \r\n  v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88, 538 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The ALJ found \r\n  Daisy had failed to overcome SCDOTâ€™s prima facie case that Quick Response was \r\n  a sham activity.Â  We reject Daisyâ€™s contention that the ALJ improperly shifted \r\n  the burden of proof to Daisy.Â  Furthermore, we find substantial evidence in \r\n  the record supports the ALJâ€™s finding that Daisy failed to overcome SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  prima facie case that Quick Response was primarily situated at this location \r\n  to qualify the sign sites as an unzoned commercial area.\r\nPursuant to Regulation 63-342(U), Daisy had the burden of coming forward \r\n  with evidence to show (1) Quick Response was not created primarily or exclusively \r\n  to qualify the location for an outdoor advertising sign, and (2) it conducted \r\n  meaningful activity at the site.Â  Daisy asserts it met this burden by presenting \r\n  evidence that Quick Response was a viable business conducting meaningful business \r\n  for more than a year before the approval of the sign permits.Â  The issue is \r\n  not whether Quick Response was a legitimate business, but rather whether its \r\n  activities at the site were created primarily or exclusively to qualify the \r\n  site for placement of the signs.\r\nDaisy, whose primary business is outdoor advertising, owns the buildings \r\n  Quick Response occupied on the site.Â  Daisy and Quick Response entered into \r\n  the lease on April 23, 1998.Â  The terms of the lease were very favorable towards \r\n  Quick Response.Â  The rent was only $400.00 a month compared to $1,600.00 a month \r\n  Quick Response paid at its former location.Â  Daisy continued to pay the electric \r\n  bills for the site until October 19, 1998, when the electricity was connected \r\n  in Quick Responseâ€™s name.Â  Quick Response did not reimburse Daisy until eight \r\n  months later for all of the bills it had paid from April to October.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is no \r\n  dispute that Quick Response conducted its normal business activities at the \r\n  site from April of 1998 until May of 1999.Â  However, Spartanburg County never \r\n  issued a certificate of occupancy for the building on the site.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  no business could legally occupy the structure.Â  SCDOTâ€™s Director of Outdoor \r\n  Advertising testified that in addition to the closing of the business within \r\n  one year of the permit, SCDOT considered the fact that Quick Response did not \r\n  have a permit to occupy the building in determining that no meaningful business \r\n  occurred at the location.\r\nWe next consider whether Quick Response conducted meaningful business \r\n  at the location.Â  The ALJ held, â€œ[T]he issue is not whether the qualifying business \r\n  was operational prior to the submittal of outdoor advertising permit applications \r\n  to SCDOT but rather whether it â€˜maintainedâ€™ meaningful operation after the permit \r\n  was approved in order to provide evidence of a commercial area.â€Â  Daisy asserts \r\n  the ALJ improperly held that the time period for measuring whether a qualifying \r\n  business is conducting meaningful business continues for a period of one year \r\n  after approval of the permit.Â  It asserts that the operative time in which the \r\n  business must be evaluated is at the time of the application or during the initial \r\n  investigation surrounding the issuance of the permits.\r\nâ€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair \r\n  interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  \r\n  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998); see also Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. \r\n  1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997) (stating courts should consider not merely the language \r\n  of the particular clause being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction \r\n  with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law).Â  â€œThe construction \r\n  of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded \r\n  the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling \r\n  reasons.â€Â  Dunton v. South Carolina Bd. of Examiners in Optometry, 291 \r\n  S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987).Â  Furthermore, an agencyâ€™s interpretation \r\n  of its own regulation deserves considerable deference.Â  Leventis v. S.C. \r\n  Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 340 S.C. 118, 530 S.E.2d 643 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000).\r\nSCDOT considers the year following the issuance of the permit in determining \r\n  whether meaningful activities occur at a qualifying business.Â  In promulgating \r\n  Regulation 63-342(U), SCDOT obviously intended for the entire one-year period \r\n  following the issuance of the permit to be considered in its evaluation as the \r\n  failure of the business to maintain the business for that year constitutes prima \r\n  facie evidence that the activity is a sham.Â  This interpretation is consistent \r\n  with the Highway Advertising Control Actâ€™s requirement that outdoor advertising \r\n  signs be limited to unzoned areas of commercial activity.Â  It furthers the purpose \r\n  of the act, which, in part, is to prevent distraction of operators of motor \r\n  vehicles, promote the safety, convenience, and enjoyment of travel on highways \r\n  within this State, and preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty and aesthetic \r\n  features of highways and adjacent areas.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-150 (Supp. \r\n  2001).Â  SCDOTâ€™s Director of Outdoor Advertising explained that if SCDOT did \r\n  not effectively regulate the activities it permitted as commercial activities, \r\n  the Federal Highway Administration could penalize the state by withholding up \r\n  to ten percent of the stateâ€™s federal highway funds.Â  Accordingly, we find no \r\n  error in the ALJâ€™s interpretation of the regulation.\r\nConsidering the record as a whole and the purpose of the Act and regulations, \r\n  we find substantial evidence supports the ALJâ€™s determination that Daisy did \r\n  not establish Quick Response conducted meaningful business at the location.Â  \r\n  Thus, we hold the ALJ did not err in ruling that Quick Response was a sham activity \r\n  under the Highway Advertising Control Act, requiring cancellation of the outdoor \r\n  advertising permits and removal of the sign structures.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Transient or temporary activities are defined as activities that \r\n    do not have:\r\n  \r\n  (1)Â  at \r\n    least one employee attendant at the activity site, performing meaningful work \r\n    and available to the public for at least thirty-six (36) hours per week on \r\n    at least four (4) days per week for at least forty-eight (48) weeks per year;\r\n  (2)Â  electricity, telephone, \r\n    running water, indoor restroom, permanent flooring other than dirt, gravel, \r\n    sand, etc; adequate heating; and\r\n  (3)Â  the activity, or a \r\n    major portion of it, conducted from a permanent building constructed principally \r\n    of brick, concrete block, stone, concrete, metal, or wood or some combination \r\n    of these materials or from a mobile home or trailer which the applicant can \r\n    prove is considered part of the real estate and taxed accordingly.\r\n  \r\n  25A S.C.

C. Buddy Nicholson, Jr., Circuit \r\n  Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3565\r\nHeard September 10, 2002 â€“ Filed November \r\n  12, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAndrew F. Lindemann and William H. Davidson, II, both of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nSammyÂ  Diamaduros, of Union; Suzanne E. Coe, of Atlanta; for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This case arises out of the death of a motorist who was \r\n  struck and killed by a suspect fleeing from a high-speed police pursuit.Â  Ronald \r\n  Clark, as personal representative of the estate of his daughter, Amy Clark, \r\n  sued the South Carolina Department of Public Safety (the Department) and Charles \r\n  Clyde Johnson, the suspect, after Amy was fatally injured when Johnson crossed \r\n  the center line and struck her vehicle.Â  Clark alleged the Departmentâ€™s employees \r\n  failed to properly supervise the pursuit and to terminate it before the fatal \r\n  accident.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Clark against both the Department \r\n  and Johnson.Â  The Department appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early morning hours of April 5, 1997, state trooper Greg Bradley \r\n  of the South Carolina Highway Patrol observed a van driven by Johnson traveling \r\n  57 m.p.h. in an area with a posted speed limit of 45 m.p.h.Â  Johnson, who was \r\n  under the influence of drugs and alcohol, was driving erratically and not using \r\n  his turn signals.Â  Bradley activated his blue lights and siren and attempted \r\n  to stop the van, but Johnson refused to stop.Â  Bradley called in the vanâ€™s license \r\n  plate number to dispatchers and advised he was commencing pursuit.Â  \r\nJohnson made several turns, disregarded a stop sign, and eventually \r\n  stopped in a gravel parking lot.Â  As Bradley exited his vehicle and approached \r\n  the back of the van, Johnson suddenly put the van into reverse and tried to \r\n  run over him.Â  Johnson hurriedly drove off, throwing gravel into the air.Â  Bradley \r\n  advised the dispatchers that he had almost been hit, and he resumed the pursuit. \r\n  Â Bradley saw Johnson run off the left side of the road and spin around while \r\n  traveling at a high rate of speed.Â  Bradley radioed that he believed Johnson \r\n  was going to wreck the vehicle.Â  \r\nTrooper Thomas Justice joined the pursuit and attempted to slow the \r\n  van down by pulling in front of it.Â  Johnson went around him by driving into \r\n  the opposing lane of traffic.Â  It was approximately 1:30 a.m. and there was \r\n  no traffic at that time.Â  Bradley continued following Johnson, and Justice fell \r\n  into position behind Bradley.Â  As the secondary officer involved in the pursuit, \r\n  Justice took over most of the radio communications so Bradley could focus on \r\n  the pursuit.Â Â Â  \r\nAround the time Justice joined the pursuit, dispatchers notified the troopers \r\n  that the van had been reported stolen.Â  Bradley observed light traffic as they \r\n  drove through a straight portion of the road.Â  Bradley attempted to pass Johnson \r\n  on the left and get in front of the van in order to slow it down, but Johnson \r\n  tried to run him off the road.Â  As they approached an intersection, Johnson \r\n  ran a red light and almost â€œT-boned,â€ or broadsided, another car.Â  The troopers \r\n  slowed down to safely clear the intersection.Â  The troopers traveled at speeds \r\n  of 80 and 85 m.p.h. in their attempt to catch Johnson.Â  \r\nAs Johnson proceeded toward the North Carolina border, then only five or six \r\n  miles away, he came upon a pickup truck.Â  Johnson tried to pass the truck on \r\n  the right using the emergency lane, but the truck also pulled to the right.Â  \r\n  Johnson immediately jerked the van to the left, crossed the center line, and \r\n  crashed head-on into a vehicle driven by Amy Clark.Â  The van became airborne \r\n  before crashing into some nearby woods and catching on fire.Â  The troopersâ€™ \r\n  cars did not make contact with the other vehicles.Â  The entire chase occurred \r\n  over an area of approximately eight miles and lasted from six to eight minutes.Â  \r\n\r\nAmy died at the scene.  [1] Â  \r\nSergeant John Vaughn was the district supervisor on \r\n  call that night.Â  Vaughn called in and inquired whether a supervisor was needed \r\n  when he heard Bradley tell the dispatchers he was initiating a pursuit.Â  Vaughn \r\n  could not recall, however, whether he had actually monitored any portion of \r\n  the\r\n  pursuit.Â  Trooper Lonnie Plyler, the supervisor for the second shift, [2]  did not monitor the pursuit because he was \r\n  handling the administration of a breathalyzer examination.Â  Plyler was unaware \r\n  who the third-shift supervisor was for that evening, but Plyler did go to the \r\n  scene of the accident after Justice radioed for a supervisor.Â  \r\nClark brought this action under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act \r\n  against the Department and Johnson for the death of his daughter.Â  Johnson went \r\n  into default and was unable to contest his liability.Â  At trial, the jury returned \r\n  a verdict for Clark for $3.75 million in total damages against both Johnson \r\n  and the Department on his wrongful death claim.Â  The jury apportioned 80 per \r\n  cent fault to Johnson and 20 per cent to the Department, resulting in a verdict \r\n  against Johnson for $3.0 million and against the Department for $750,000.Â  The \r\n  trial court reduced the verdict against the Department to $250,000 in accordance \r\n  with the limit imposed by the Tort Claims Act. [3] Â  \r\nAlthough it is not clear from the transcript, at some point the jury \r\n  submitted a note regarding its verdict, which reads as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nThe Vehicle [and] Foot Pursuit Policy of SCDPS \r\n  [the Department] dictates supervision of all pursuits.Â  During this pursuit \r\n  no supervisors were present or notified until after the pursuit was ended.Â  \r\n  It is our decision that this designates gross neglect on the behalf of SCDPS.\r\n\r\nThe Department thereafter moved for JNOV, new trial absolute, and \r\n  new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial court denied the \r\n  motions.Â  The Department appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Denial of DV and JNOV Motions\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Department first contends Clark was unable to sustain his burden \r\n  of proof regarding its liability for Amyâ€™s death.Â  Specifically, the Department \r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict and \r\n  for JNOV because Clark failed to demonstrate Bradley was grossly negligent in \r\n  initiating, continuing, or failing to terminate the pursuit of Johnson.Â  The \r\n  Department also asserts the juryâ€™s note constituted a special verdict indicating \r\n  the jury did not find the trooper was grossly negligent, and there could be \r\n  no â€œderivativeâ€ or â€œcumulativeâ€ liability by the supervisor in the absence of \r\n  gross negligence by the trooper.Â  The Department argues it is, therefore, entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.\r\n The Tort Claims Act renders state agencies and governmental entities \r\n  â€œliable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private \r\n  individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitationsâ€ and exemptions \r\n  contained within the Act. [4] \r\n In addition to the Tort Claims Act, section 56-5-760 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code addresses the civil liability of operators of authorized emergency \r\n  vehicles.Â  This statute authorizes police officers using a vehicle equipped \r\n  with a siren and flashing light to exceed the maximum speed limit and to disregard \r\n  certain traffic regulations during a police pursuit. \r\n  [5] Â  The statute further provides, however, that these provisions â€œdo not \r\n  relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive \r\n  with due regard for the safety of all persons.â€ \r\n  [6] Â  \r\nAt trial, the parties agreed the applicable standard for liability \r\n  in this case was gross negligence, and the trial court charged the jury that \r\n  it was to determine whether the defendantsâ€™ gross negligence proximately caused \r\n  injury to the plaintiff. [7] Â  \r\n  Because no issue is raised on appeal regarding the standard for culpability, \r\n  it becomes the law of the case and we will, therefore, apply the gross negligence \r\n  standard agreed to by the parties. \r\n  [8]  Â  \r\nGross negligence has been defined a number of ways.Â  Our supreme court recently \r\n  stated â€œ[g]ross negligence is the intentional, conscious failure to do something \r\n  which is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that \r\n  one ought not to do.â€ [9] Â  â€œIt is the failure to exercise \r\n  even the slightest care.â€ [10] Â  It has also been defined as â€œthe absence of care that is \r\n  necessary under the circumstances.â€ [11] \r\nThe existence of gross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question \r\n  of both law and fact. [12] Â  \r\n  â€œWhen the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, it is solely a question \r\n  of law for the court[;] otherwise it is an issue best resolved by the jury.â€ [13] Â  \r\n  â€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required \r\n  to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom \r\n  in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the \r\n  motions where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference \r\n  is in doubt.â€ [14] Â  â€œThe trial court can only be reversed by \r\n  this Court when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.â€ \r\n  [15] Â  \r\nAs noted above, the jury submitted a statement at trial regarding \r\n  its verdict.Â  The statement suggested the jury found the Department grossly \r\n  negligent because of the failure of supervisors to monitor the pursuit and the \r\n  failure to call it off.Â  In its brief, the Department argues the statement served \r\n  the same purpose as a special verdict.Â  The Department also argues the trial \r\n  court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict and JNOV because the \r\n  allegations regarding the lack of supervision only gave rise to â€œderivativeâ€ \r\n  or â€œcumulativeâ€ liability and do not independently support the juryâ€™s verdict \r\n  in the absence of gross negligence by the trooper.\r\nWe hold, however, the note did not transform the verdict into a special verdict \r\n  and there was evidence to warrant submission of the question of the Departmentâ€™s \r\n  liability to the jury.Â  The statement does not exclude a finding of gross negligence \r\n  on the part of Bradley and does not constitute part of the verdict.Â  The transcript \r\n  indicates the trial court made no mention of the note in publishing the verdict, \r\n  nor did it otherwise treat the note as part of the verdict.Â  As such, we find \r\n  the note was not a special verdict that limited the ground for the juryâ€™s finding \r\n  to the acts and omissions of the Departmentâ€™s supervisors.Â  \r\nMoreover, although the Department attempts to base its lack of liability solely \r\n  on the actions of the trooper, the issue in this case is whether there was any \r\n  evidence of gross negligence by the Department, through the acts and omissions \r\n  of its employees, which consists of both the troopers and the supervisors.Â  \r\n  We agree with the trial court that the liability of the supervisors referred \r\n  to in this case is distinguishable from cases alleging vicarious liability on \r\n  the part of a supervisor.Â  Rather, there were two sets of duties involved.Â  \r\n  First, the trooper, as the pursuing officer, had a â€œduty to drive with due regard \r\n  for the safety of all persons.â€ \r\n  [16] Â  Clarkâ€™s expert in high-speed police chases, Samuel Killman, testified \r\n  the standard for a pursuing trooper is that he must continue to evaluate the \r\n  need to apprehend the suspect versus the danger of the pursuit to the publicâ€™s \r\n  safety and try to balance those competing concerns.Â  Secondly, Killman testified \r\n  the supervisors at the Department had an independent duty to monitor the acts \r\n  of the troopers and take any actions deemed appropriate, including termination \r\n  of the chase.Â  He based this duty on both the Departmentâ€™s own internal policy \r\n  and on general standards of conduct recognized by law enforcement agencies, \r\n  primarily the latter.Â  \r\nThe evidence in the light most favorable to Clark shows Killman testified the \r\n  pursuit should have been called off after it was obvious Johnson was willing \r\n  to do whatever it took to get away.Â  Killman stated that, after Johnson attempted \r\n  to run Bradley off the road and then almost â€œT-bonedâ€ a car at an intersection, \r\n  Bradley should have called off the pursuit in the interest of public safety.Â  \r\n  At the time of the fatal crash, Johnson was only five or six miles from the \r\n  North Carolina border, at which point South Carolina authorities would have \r\n  had to terminate the pursuit anyway.Â  The heightened dangerousness of the pursuit \r\n  is particularly evidenced by the fact that Bradley himself admittedly notified \r\n  dispatchers at one point that he believed a crash was imminent. [17] Â  Although Killman indicated it was an â€œerror in judgmentâ€ \r\n  not to call off the pursuit, we believe the foregoing is some evidence from \r\n  which a jury could determine Bradley should have called off the pursuit and \r\n  was grossly negligent in failing to do so.Â  Also, Killman testified that, in \r\n  accordance with general police standards, a supervisor should always monitor \r\n  a pursuit and provide an independent assessment of its continued viability.Â  \r\n  There was no evidence a supervisor did this. \r\nWe hold the question of whether the troopers and the supervisors at the Department \r\n  performed their respective duties or whether there was an â€œabsence of care that \r\n  is necessary under the circumstancesâ€ [18]  was a matter singularly for the jury to consider as the trier \r\n  of fact. \r\nII.Â  Immunity Under Section 15-78-60(5) for Discretionary Acts\r\nThe Department next asserts Bradleyâ€™s conduct was subject to absolute \r\n  discretionary immunity under section 15-78-60(5) of the Tort Claims Act.Â  This \r\n  section provides a governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:\r\n\r\nthe exercise of discretion or judgment by the governmental \r\n  entity or employee or the performance or failure to perform any act or service \r\n  which is in the discretion or judgment of the governmental entity or employee \r\n  . . . . [19] \r\n\r\nâ€œThe burden of establishing a limitation upon liability or an exception to \r\n  the waiver of immunity is upon the governmental entity asserting it as an affirmative \r\n  defense.â€ [20] Â  \r\nâ€œTo establish discretionary immunity, the governmental entity must prove that \r\n  the governmental employees, faced with alternatives, actually weighed competing \r\n  considerations and made a conscious choice.â€ [21] Â  â€œFurthermore, â€˜the governmental entity must \r\n  show that in weighing the competing considerations and alternatives, it utilized \r\n  accepted professional standards appropriate to resolve the issue before them.â€™â€ [22] Â  â€œThis standard is inherently factual.â€ \r\n  [23] Â  \r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict motion, this court should review \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Clark to see if the evidence yields \r\n  more than one reasonable inference and the trial court properly submitted the \r\n  case to the jury. [24]  Â That \r\n  is, we would consider whether there was an issue of fact as to whether (1) the \r\n  Departmentâ€™s employees actually weighed competing considerations and made a \r\n  conscious choice to continue the pursuit, and (2) whether the Department established \r\n  that, in weighing these alternatives, it applied accepted professional standards. \r\n  [25] \r\nClark presented the testimony of his expert in high-speed chases, Samuel Killman, \r\n  that the Departmentâ€™s employees did not properly balance the competing considerations \r\n  of capturing a fleeing suspect versus maintaining the publicâ€™s safety and that \r\n  they disregarded appropriate standards in failing to terminate the pursuit.Â  \r\n  The Department attempted to rebut this evidence with Bradleyâ€™s testimony that \r\n  he did weigh these competing concerns.Â  This created a question of fact that \r\n  could not be resolved by the trial court.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court \r\n  properly denied the Departmentâ€™s motions for judgment as a matter of law on \r\n  the ground of discretionary immunity.Â  \r\nMoreover, we question whether the discretionary immunity provision is applicable \r\n  to this case in any event.Â  Some jurisdictions determine whether an act is discretionary \r\n  by considering if it can best be described as planning or operational. \r\n  [26] Â  In this case, we believe the function of the Departmentâ€™s employees \r\n  in carrying out a general pursuit policy is operational in nature and is not \r\n  the type of discretionary act contemplated in the Tort Claims Act.Â  The fact \r\n  that the employees had to make decisions or exercise some judgment in their \r\n  activities is not determinative. [27] Â  To read the exception that broadly would encompass virtually \r\n  all traffic stops made by the Departmentâ€™s employees, as they all involve some \r\n  degree of decision-making, but they are not the type of discretionary act envisioned \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act. [28] \r\n  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Immunity Under Section 15-78-60(4) for the Failure\r\nto Enforce \r\n  Written Policies\r\nThe Department next alleges it was entitled to absolute immunity \r\n  as a matter of law under section 15-78-60(4) of the Tort Claims Act.Â  In the \r\n  alternative, the Department argues it is entitled to a new trial because the \r\n  court allegedly refused to charge this immunity provision after Clarkâ€™s counsel \r\n  raised purported violations of the Departmentâ€™s Pursuit Policy during closing \r\n  argument.Â  \r\nSection 15-78-60(4) provides a governmental entity \r\n  is not liable for losses resulting from the\r\n\r\nadoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure \r\n  to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited \r\n  to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or written \r\n  policies . . . .  [29] \r\n\r\nIn 1996, the Department adopted \r\n  the South Carolina Department of Public Safety Policy Directive, Vehicle and \r\n  Foot Pursuit Policy, which addresses the duties of troopers and their supervisors.Â  \r\n  The Pursuit Policy requires a supervisor to monitor all pursuits and states \r\n  in relevant part:Â  â€œThe supervisor will continuously evaluate pursuit and will \r\n  order termination of the pursuit when it appears to constitute an unreasonable \r\n  risk.â€Â  \r\nCiting section 15-78-60(4), the Department asserts it is immune from \r\n  liability for failing to enforce any written policy, in this case, the Pursuit \r\n  Policyâ€™s guideline that a supervisor monitor all pursuits.\r\nIn denying the Departmentâ€™s directed verdict motion at the end of \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s case, the trial court found the Department was not entitled \r\n  to absolute immunity under section 15-78-60(4) for the failure to enforce any \r\n  law or written policy, stating, â€œI donâ€™t think it was a policy violation.Â  I \r\n  think it was a violation of the standard of care that they are supposed to provide \r\n  to the public.â€Â  \r\nWe hold the trial court properly refused to grant the Department judgment as \r\n  a matter of law because the actions of the Department do not fall within the \r\n  parameters of section 15-78-60(4).Â  As noted by Clark, the Pursuit Policy was \r\n  merely a statement of generally accepted law enforcement guidelines.Â  This broad \r\n  provision is not the kind of written policy that should be afforded the protection \r\n  of absolute immunity under the Tort Claims Act. [30] Â Â Â  \r\nThe duty of the supervisor to monitor the pursuit was testified to as the standard \r\n  of care without reference to the policy adopted by the Department.Â  The Department \r\n  asserted, and Clark expressly agreed, that this internal policy did not equate \r\n  to a legal standard of care for the Departmentâ€™s supervisors.Â  The policy mirrors \r\n  the accepted standard of care for supervisors during a pursuit.Â  The mere fact \r\n  that the Department enacted a policy does not protect it from having to meet \r\n  a standard of care that exists whether the policy was enacted or not.Â  The underlying \r\n  action is not brought as a violation of the Departmentâ€™s policy, but as a violation \r\n  of the recognized duty of care that supervisors owe during the monitoring of \r\n  a high-speed pursuit.\r\nTo the extent the Department appears to challenge the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  failure to charge the jury on this immunity provision, we find this issue is \r\n  not preserved.Â  In the order denying the Departmentâ€™s post-trial motions, the \r\n  trial court specifically noted that the Department never objected to its failure \r\n  to charge section 15-78-60(4). [31] \r\n  Â  \r\nIV.Â  Jury Instruction Regarding Standard of Care\r\nThe Department next contends the trial court erred in failing to \r\n  charge the jury on the legal duty or standard of care owed by law enforcement \r\n  officers with respect to police pursuits.Â  The Department asserts the trial \r\n  court instead permitted the jury to determine the standard of care to be applied \r\n  based upon the testimony of expert witnesses.Â  We do not read the courtâ€™s charge \r\n  that way.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s charge did not allow the jury to determine the law.Â  Rather, \r\n  the court charged the jury on general principles of negligence law.Â  Further, \r\n  the Department did not clearly and specifically request a jury instruction regarding \r\n  the existence and nature of any alleged duty by its supervisors to monitor all \r\n  police pursuits.Â  Thus, we find no reversible error in this regard. [32] Â  \r\nV.Â  New Trial Absolute\r\nThe Department asserts it is entitled to a new trial absolute because \r\n  the verdict is excessive and shockingly disproportionate to the damages sustained \r\n  so as to indicate that the jury acted out of passion, caprice, prejudice, or \r\n  other improper considerations.Â  \r\n A motion for new trial nisi remittitur asks the \r\n  trial court in its discretion to reduce the verdict because it is â€œmerely excessive,â€ \r\n  although not motivated by considerations such as passion, caprice, or prejudice. [33] Â  In contrast, if the amount of the verdict \r\n  is â€œgrossly excessive,â€ so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, \r\n  or some other influence outside the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new \r\n  trial absolute, rather than a new trial nisi remittitur. \r\n  [34] Â  \r\nThe juryâ€™s determination of damages is entitled to substantial deference. [35] Â  The denial of a new trial motion is within the discretion \r\n  of the trial court and, absent an abuse of discretion, it will not be reversed \r\n  on appeal. [36] Â  \r\nSection 15-51-20 provides a wrongful death action may be brought \r\n  for the benefit of the statutory beneficiaries, in this case, the parents. \r\n  [37] Â  â€œDamages recoverable for wrongful death are the damages sustained \r\n  by the statutory beneficiaries resulting from the death of the decedent, including \r\n  pecuniary loss, mental shock and suffering, wounded feelings, grief, sorrow, \r\n  and loss of society and companionship.â€ \r\n  [38] Â  \r\nThe jury awarded Clark a verdict of $3.75 million in total damages \r\n  against Johnson and the Department on his wrongful death claim.Â  The jury apportioned \r\n  80 per cent fault to Johnson and 20 per cent fault to the Department, resulting \r\n  in verdicts against Johnson for $3.0 million and against the Department for \r\n  $750,000.Â  The trial court reduced the verdict against the Department to $250,000 \r\n  as required by the Tort Claims Act.Â  \r\nIn Lucht v. Youngblood, \r\n  [39]  our supreme court observed that losses to parents for the untimely \r\n  death of a child â€œare intangibles, the value of which cannot be determined by \r\n  any fixed yardstick.â€ [40] Â  The â€œloss to the beneficiaries must be estimated by the jury \r\n  in the exercise of their sound judgment under all the facts and circumstances \r\n  of the case.â€ [41] Â  \r\nIn Knoke v. South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and \r\n  Tourism, [42]  the court \r\n  concluded a wrongful death verdict of $3.0 million for the death of a twelve-year-old \r\n  child was not an excessive verdict.Â  The court stated:Â  â€œAlthough there was \r\n  no evidence of pecuniary loss introduced at trial, both parents testified to \r\n  their grief, shock, and sense of loss.Â  In the absence of pecuniary loss, the \r\n  $3,000,000 verdict was to compensate Jeremyâ€™s parents for these intangible damages \r\n  which, as previously noted by this Court, cannot be determined by any fixed \r\n  measure.â€ [43]   \r\nGiven the nature of the loss endured by Clark, and the necessarily nonpecuniary \r\n  elements involved, we are not persuaded the verdict was the result of passion \r\n  or other improper motive, nor is it so excessive as to shock the conscience.Â  \r\n  Consequently, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining \r\n  to grant a new trial. [44] Â  \r\nVI.Â  More Detailed Order \r\nThe Department finally alleges â€œ[t]he trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to issue an order setting forth in reasonable detail the legal analysis supporting \r\n  its denial of [its] post-trial motions.â€Â  \r\nCiting Bowen v. Lee Process Systems Co., [45]  the Department states it is â€œrais[ing] this \r\n  issue in the event this Court finds that it cannot properly review the denial \r\n  of the post-trial motions without knowing the trial courtâ€™s reasoning for its \r\n  rulings.â€Â  \r\nIn Bowen, the trial court granted summary judgment to the \r\n  defendants, but failed to state on which of several asserted grounds it was \r\n  relying.Â  We vacated the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case to \r\n  the trial court to enter an order identifying the material facts it found undisputed \r\n  and the grounds for its decision as they were not discernable on appeal.\r\nWe conclude Bowen is distinguishable from the current appeal.Â  The trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order denying the Departmentâ€™s post-trial motions is sufficient as the \r\n  courtâ€™s reasoning for the denial can be determined from the record on appeal.Â  \r\n  Further, there is no blanket requirement that the trial court set forth a separate \r\n  explanation on all of its rulings on post-trial motions. [46] Â  \r\nAccordingly, the judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHOWARD AND SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Johnson pled guilty in September 1997 to charges of felony DUI causing \r\n    death, failure to stop for a blue light resulting in death, felony DUI causing \r\n    great bodily injury, assault with intent to kill, and possession of a stolen \r\n    vehicle. Â It was stipulated at trial that Johnson registered a .244 on a blood \r\n    alcohol test and also tested positive for marijuana and cocaine.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] Â  The accident occurred during the third shift.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  The Tort Claims Act was subsequently amended to increase the limitation \r\n    on liability to $300,000 per person because of loss arising from a single \r\n    occurrence.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120(a)(1) (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-760(A)-(C) (1991).\r\n\r\n \r\n  [6]&nbsp; Id. Â§ 56-5-760(D).\r\n\r\n \r\n  [7]&nbsp;\r\n  Section 56-5-760(D) imposes upon emergency vehicle operators â€œthe duty \r\n    to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons.â€Â  Id. (emphasis \r\n    added).Â  Prior to its amendment in 1990, however, the former version stated \r\n    its provisions â€œshall not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle \r\n    from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons nor \r\n    shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless \r\n    disregard for the safety of others.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-760(d) (Supp. \r\n    1989) (emphasis added); see Act No. 149, Â§ 3, 1990 S.C. Acts 312.Â  \r\n    Case law interpreting this former version applied a â€œreckless conductâ€ standard.Â  \r\n    See, e.g., Jones v. Way, 278 S.C. 295, 294 S.E.2d 432 (1982).Â  \r\n    We note that, in stating a gross negligence standard applied, trial counsel \r\n    referred to the statuteâ€™s language regarding reckless conduct, but the 1990 \r\n    amendment deleted the reference to reckless acts.Â  Upon reviewing the statute, \r\n    the trial court opined whether it reduced the burden from gross negligence \r\n    to ordinary negligence, but no issue was pursued by counsel in this regard.Â  \r\n    There is some divergence among the jurisdictions as to whether â€œthe duty to \r\n    drive with due regard for the safety of all personsâ€ imposes an ordinary negligence \r\n    standard, a reckless conduct standard, or something in between.Â  See, e.g., \r\n    City of Amarillo v. Martin, 971 S.W.2d 426, 428-30 (Tex. 1998) (interpreting \r\n    a Texas statute, similar to South Carolinaâ€™s pre-1990 version, which stated \r\n    drivers of emergency vehicles had a duty to exercise â€œdue regard for the safety \r\n    of all personsâ€ but were not exempted from liability for â€œthe consequences \r\n    of [their] reckless disregard for the safety of othersâ€ and holding it imposed \r\n    liability only for the reckless operation of an emergency vehicle, rather \r\n    than for mere negligence).Â  We further note the jury was not charged on any \r\n    immunity provision under the Tort Claims Act containing a gross negligence \r\n    standard.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8] Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, \r\n    327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling becomes \r\n    the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal); \r\n    cf. Kolster v. City of El Paso, 972 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. 1998) (observing \r\n    the trial court erroneously determined that ordinary negligence, rather than \r\n    recklessness, was the proper standard under a Texas statute addressing the \r\n    liability of emergency vehicle operators for accidents where the statute provided \r\n    drivers were not exempted for â€œrecklessâ€ conduct; the appellate court stated \r\n    it would, nevertheless, apply a simple negligence standard on appeal because \r\n    that was the standard submitted to the jury and the City did not preserve \r\n    any issue as to the proper standard of culpability).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9] Â  Faile v.

Maybank appeals his convictions for possession of crack \r\n  cocaine, possession of cocaine, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer \r\n  while resisting arrest.Â  He argues the trial court erred in failing to suppress \r\n  evidence obtained pursuant to a warrantless search of his motel room because \r\n  the police went to his room as a result of an invalid traffic stop of his vehicle.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn August \r\n  1999, Detective Christopher Arakas observed a vehicle with a temporary license \r\n  tag being driven along Highway 501 in Myrtle Beach.Â  Based solely on the presence \r\n  of the temporary tag, Arakas stopped the vehicle and spoke with the driver, \r\n  an unlicensed fourteen-year-old male (â€œthe youthâ€).Â  As a result of this conversation, \r\n  Arakas discovered Maybank was the owner of the vehicle and had allowed the youth \r\n  to drive it.Â  Intending to charge Maybank with allowing a fourteen year old \r\n  to drive his vehicle, Arakas and Officer Joliff drove the youth to the motel \r\n  where Maybank was staying.\r\nThe youth \r\n  knocked on the motel room door, Maybank answered â€œyeah?â€, and the youth opened \r\n  the door.Â  Arakas and Joliff saw Maybank and a woman lying in bed and marijuana \r\n  lying on a table.Â  The officers identified themselves as police and told Maybank \r\n  they wished to come in and speak with him about letting the youth drive his \r\n  vehicle. Â Maybank gave the officers permission to enter.\r\nAs Maybank \r\n  stood up from the bed, he grabbed something off the nightstand.Â  Arakas asked \r\n  Maybank if the officers could see what he had picked up.Â  Maybank opened his \r\n  hand revealing a tissue-wrapped, plastic bag containing crack cocaine.\r\nAfter \r\n  the officers told Maybank he was under arrest, he shoved Joliff aside and ran \r\n  through the motel room doorway attempting to escape.Â  As the two officers tried \r\n  to apprehend him, Maybank engaged in several brief fights with each of them.Â  \r\n  Maybank was eventually captured by backup officers, arrested, and later indicted \r\n  for trafficking crack cocaine, possession of cocaine, and two counts of assaulting \r\n  a police officer while resisting arrest.\r\nPrior \r\n  to trial, Maybank moved to suppress the illegal drugs found in the motel room.Â  \r\n  He argued because the officers would not have discovered the drugs but for the \r\n  initial stop of his vehicle, the drugs should be suppressed.Â  The State argued \r\n  the drugs should be admitted into evidence because Maybank had no standing to \r\n  challenge the stop, and in the alternative, a sufficient break existed in the \r\n  causal connection between the improper stop and the discovery of the drugs.\r\nBased \r\n  on testimony presented at the suppression hearing, the trial court determined \r\n  the initial stop of Maybankâ€™s vehicle was invalid, \r\n  [1]  but found the improper stop did not infect the subsequent discovery \r\n  of the illegal drugs in Maybankâ€™s motel room.Â  Furthermore, the trial court \r\n  determined Maybank consented to the officersâ€™ request to enter his room.Â  Thus, \r\n  the trial court denied Maybankâ€™s motion to suppress, and the jury convicted \r\n  Maybank of possession of crack cocaine, possession of powder cocaine, resisting \r\n  arrest, and assaulting a police officer while resisting arrest.Â  Maybank appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Initial Traffic Stop\r\nMaybank \r\n  asserts the initial traffic stop of his vehicle violated his Fourth Amendment \r\n  rights even though he was not present during the stop.Â  Therefore, he argues \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to suppress drugs found in his motel room as \r\n  a result of information obtained during that stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, \r\n  we note, both Maybank and the State incorrectly couch their arguments in terms \r\n  of whether Maybank has standing to assert the officersâ€™ conduct violated his \r\n  reasonable expectation of privacy in his vehicle.Â  However, the boundaries of \r\n  the Fourth Amendment are not â€œdefined exclusively by rights of privacy.â€  [2] Â  Soldal v. Cook County, \r\n  506 U.S. 56, 65-66 (1992).\r\nThe \r\n  question before this Court is neither whether Maybank has standing, nor whether \r\n  his reasonable expectation of privacy was violated.Â  Rather, we must evaluate \r\n  the substantive issue [3]  of \r\n  whether Maybank suffered a meaningful interference with a sufficient possessory \r\n  interest in his vehicle.\r\nA.Â  Meaningful \r\n  Interference\r\nâ€œA â€˜seizureâ€™ \r\n  of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individualâ€™s \r\n  possessory interests in that property.â€Â  United States v. Jacobsen, 466 \r\n  U.S. 109, 133 (1984).Â  For Fourth Amendment purposes, the traffic stop of a \r\n  vehicle is a seizure.Â  See State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 192-93, \r\n  519 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1999).Â  In addition, the â€œ[t]emporary detention of individuals \r\n  during the stop of an automobile . . . constitutes [a] â€˜seizureâ€™ of persons \r\n  within the meaning of [the] Fourth Amendment.â€Â  Whren v. United States, \r\n  517 U.S. 806, 809-10 (1996).Â  Therefore, when the officers stopped Maybankâ€™s \r\n  vehicle, they clearly interfered with some individualâ€™s possessory interest \r\n  in that vehicle.\r\nB.Â  Sufficient \r\n  Possessory Interest\r\nMeaningful \r\n  interference with an individualâ€™s possessory interest is only the first step \r\n  in the analysis.Â  For Maybankâ€™s argument to have merit, this Court must find \r\n  the officersâ€™ traffic stop interfered with his possessory interest in \r\n  that vehicle.Â  We hold it did not.\r\nIn United \r\n  States v. Powell, 929 F.2d 1190, 1191 (7th Cir. 1991), police officers stopped \r\n  a truck traveling along a public highway because the driver failed to use a \r\n  blinker when entering the flow of traffic.Â  The driver informed the officer \r\n  the truck belonged to Powell, who had hired the driver to deliver the truck \r\n  to him.Â  A subsequent search of the camper shell attached to the truck revealed \r\n  several bundles of marijuana.Â  Id.Â  The driver assisted law enforcement \r\n  officials by leading them to Powell.Â  The police arrested Powell on drug charges.Â  \r\n  At Powellâ€™s subsequent trial, he attempted to suppress the drugs discovered \r\n  as a result of the traffic stop.Â  Id. at 1192.\r\nThe Seventh \r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals determined the initial stop of the truck was invalid.Â  \r\n  Id. at 1993-94.Â  However, the court went on to evaluate whether the police \r\n  violated Powellâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully seizing the truck.Â  \r\n  Id. at 1194-96.Â  The court reasoned the interests implicated by a vehicle \r\n  stop are a motoristâ€™s right to be free from random, unauthorized seizures and \r\n  to avoid the considerable anxiety these stops create.Â  The court noted further \r\n  â€œ[b]oth these interests are personal to the driver and passengers in the car \r\n  stopped.â€Â  Id. at 1195.Â  The court ruled the â€œpersonal nature of the \r\n  interests implicated by a vehicle stop persuade us that a vehicle owner who \r\n  is not in his car at the time it is stopped [cannot normally] . . . object to \r\n  the stop.â€Â  Id.\r\nThus, \r\n  although Powell owned the vehicle, the court determined ownership alone was \r\n  insufficient to substantiate the argument that the officersâ€™ brief seizure of \r\n  his vehicle meaningfully interfered with his possessory interest in that vehicle.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the court held his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.Â  Id. \r\n  at 1196.\r\nSimilar \r\n  to the defendantâ€™s assertion in Powell, Maybank argues the initial stop \r\n  of his vehicle violated his Fourth Amendment rights even though he was not present \r\n  during the stop.Â  However, we find the Seventh Circuitâ€™s decision in Powell \r\n  persuasive in both its reasoning and result.Â  We hold Maybankâ€™s ownership of \r\n  the vehicle, without more, does not substantiate the argument he retained a \r\n  sufficient possessory interest to object to the temporary seizure of his vehicle \r\n  during a traffic stop.Â  Cf. Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, \r\n  106 (1980) (holding mere ownership of property seized as a result of an unlawful \r\n  search is insufficient to permit defendant to assert a Fourth Amendment violation); \r\n  Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 171-72 (1969) (â€œ[The] suppression \r\n  of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only \r\n  by those whose rights were violated by the search itself, not by those who are \r\n  aggrieved solely by the introduction of damaging evidence.â€).\r\nMoreover, \r\n  because Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights, Maybank cannot vicariously \r\n  assert any claims the youth may have that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment \r\n  rights by stopping the vehicle without reasonable suspicion to believe a crime \r\n  had been or was being committed.Â  See Alderman, 394 U.S. at 174 \r\n  (holding Fourth Amendment rights are â€œpersonal rights which, like some other \r\n  constitutional rights, may not be vicariously assertedâ€); Simmons v. United \r\n  States, 390 U.S. 377, 389 (1968) (holding â€œrights assured by the Fourth \r\n  Amendment are personal rights, [which] . . . may be enforced by exclusion of \r\n  evidence only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the \r\n  search and seizureâ€). [4] \r\nII.Â  Consent to Enter Motel Room\r\nMaybank \r\n  next asserts the officers did not obtain consent to enter his motel room.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen \r\n  contested by contradicting testimony, consent is an issue of credibility to \r\n  be determined by the trial court.Â  State v. Dorce, 320 S.C. 480, 482, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 772, 773 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Furthermore, this Court is bound by the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they lack evidentiary support or are clearly \r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); \r\n  see also State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, 199 S.E.2d 61, 65 \r\n  (1973) (holding the appellate court sits to review errors of law in criminal \r\n  cases).\r\nDuring the hearing \r\n  on Maybankâ€™s motion to suppress, the trial court heard testimony from two police \r\n  officers alleging Maybank consented to their entry.Â  The trial court also heard \r\n  testimony from Maybank alleging he did not consent to the officersâ€™ entry.Â  \r\n  After hearing all the testimony, and weighing the credibility of the witnesses, \r\n  the trial court found Maybank consented to the officersâ€™ request to enter his \r\n  motel room.Â  Because the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by sufficient evidence \r\n  in the record, we find no error.\r\nIII.Â  Resisting \r\n  Arrest\r\nMaybank next asserts \r\n  he was permitted to resist the officersâ€™ attempt to arrest him because the arrest \r\n  was unlawful.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo determine whether \r\n  Maybank could have lawfully resisted arrest, this Court must consider\r\n\r\nwhether, at the \r\n  moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make itâ€”whether \r\n  at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which \r\n  they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent \r\n  man in believing [Maybank] had committed or was committing an offense.\r\n\r\nBeck v. Ohio, \r\n  379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964); see also State v. Robinson, 335 S.C. 620, \r\n  634, 518 S.E.2d 269, 276 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œWhether probable cause exists depends \r\n  upon the totality of the circumstances surrounding the information at the officers \r\n  [sic] disposal.â€).Â  The trial court determined the officers had probable cause \r\n  to arrest Maybank.Â  Given the totality of the circumstances surrounding his \r\n  arrest, we agree.\r\nWhen the officers \r\n  looked into Maybankâ€™s motel room, they observed marijuana lying in plain view \r\n  on a table.Â  Furthermore, when Maybank opened his hand, the officers saw crack \r\n  cocaine.Â  Therefore, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable \r\n  cause to believe Maybank â€œhad committed or was committing an offense.â€ [5] Â  See Beck, 379 U.S. at 91.Â  Because \r\n  the basis for Maybankâ€™s arrest was lawful, Maybank was not permitted to resist. [6] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing \r\n  reasons, we hold the trial court properly denied Maybankâ€™s motion to suppress.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Maybankâ€™s convictions for possession of crack cocaine, possession \r\n  of cocaine, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer while resisting \r\n  arrest are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, \r\n  C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Neither party to this appeal challenges the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n    that the initial stop of Maybankâ€™s vehicle was invalid.Â  See State \r\n    v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 202-03, 539 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding \r\n    the presence of a temporary tag on a vehicle is insufficient to provide reasonable \r\n    suspicion to perform a traffic stop).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  If our decision rested on whether Maybankâ€™s reasonable expectation \r\n    of privacy was violated, the analysis would end by stating that because Maybank \r\n    allowed his vehicle to be driven in plain view on a public street, the officersâ€™ \r\n    conduct did not implicate Fourth Amendment protections.Â  See Payton \r\n    v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586-87 (1980) (holding when officers are in \r\n    a public place, not protected by the Fourth Amendment, information gained \r\n    as a result of their presence does not implicate a defendantâ€™s reasonable \r\n    expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment); Katz v. United States, \r\n    389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967) (â€œWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public . \r\n    . . is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 139 (1978) (holding \r\n    courts must base their analysis on â€œthe extent of a particular defendantâ€™s \r\n    rights under the Fourth Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate, \r\n    but invariably intertwined concept of standingâ€); cf. State v. Hiott, \r\n    276 S.C. 72, 76-77, 276 S.E.2d 163, 165 (1981) (â€œ[T]he United States Supreme \r\n    Court has recently shifted away from a â€˜standingâ€™ approach to an inquiry focusing \r\n    directly on the substantive issue of whether the claimant possessed â€˜a legitimate \r\n    expectation of privacyâ€™ in the area searched.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Because we hold Maybank may not assert a substantive violation of \r\n    his Fourth Amendment rights occurred, we need not address whether a sufficient \r\n    break existed in the causal connection between the invalid stop and the discovery \r\n    of the drugs to warrant their admission into evidence.Â  See State \r\n    v.

We agree and reverse. \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 1998, Carlos Parson and his friend Ebay \r\n  Moore were on their way to a nearby store in York to buy beer. \r\n  (1) As they approached California Street, where \"a lot of young men\" \r\n  were hanging out, Parson noticed a black truck pull up and stop. Moore, recognizing \r\n  Rodney Smith, approached the vehicle. When Parson also approached, Moore introduced \r\n  Smith, whom Parson did not know, as \"Tee Top.\" \r\n\r\nParson then told Moore he was ready to go on to the store.  At that, Smith got out of the truck and said to Parson:  \"You don't\r\nknow me like that to be talking to me like that.\"  Although Parson denied having said anything to Smith, Smith \"raised his hand\"\r\nand said \"Man, I'm tired of these fake-ass niggers trying to handle me any kind of way.\"  The next thing Parson knew, Smith\r\nstepped up and hit him.  \r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter, Tori Rawlinson, whom Parson did know, also struck  him.  Parson fell to the ground.  Although he tried to\r\nget up, Smith and Rawlinson continued to beat him.  At that point, Lavonne Hanna, Smith's girlfriend who was not known to\r\nParson, got out of the truck and stabbed Parson several times, leaving a seventeen-inch laceration across Parson's stomach and a\r\ngash on his eyeball that nearly blinded him.  Parson did not see the weapon, which was never identified or recovered.  As the\r\npolice arrived at the scene, they passed a black truck headed in the opposite direction with three occupants; both officers\r\nidentified Hanna as the driver and one officer identified Rawlinson as one of the passengers.  \r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1998, a York County grand jury indicted \r\n  Rawlinson, Hanna, and Smith on charges of assault and battery with intent to \r\n  kill (ABIK) and lynching, second degree; Hanna was also indicted for possession \r\n  of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. In a joint trial, held \r\n  February 8, 1999, a jury convicted all three defendants of second degree lynching \r\n  and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) as a lesser \r\n  included offense of ABIK. The jury also convicted Hanna on the weapon possession \r\n  charge. Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Smith to twelve years imprisonment \r\n  for lynching and ten years concurrent for ABHAN; both were consecutive to a \r\n  sentence Smith already was serving for a parole violation. The court also imposed \r\n  joint restitution totaling $31,000 on all three defendants. \r\n\r\nPursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) \r\n  and State v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), Smith's appellate \r\n  counsel filed a brief along with a petition to be relieved, stating her examination \r\n  of the record indicated the appeal was without merit. Following our Anders \r\n  review, this Court ordered the parties to brief the following issue: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Whether the trial court erred in refusing to grant Appellant's \r\n    motion for directed verdict as to Second Degree Lynching, where the State \r\n    failed to prove the defendants acted for the premeditated purpose and with \r\n    the premeditated intent to commit an act of violence upon the person of another, \r\n    an essential element of the crime. \r\n\r\n\r\nThus, the sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to direct a verdict on the charge of second degree lynching. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nIn considering a motion for directed verdict in a criminal \r\n  case, all evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State. State \r\n  v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001); State v. Fennell, \r\n  340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000). The trial court is \"concerned with the \r\n  existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight.\" State v. Pinckney, \r\n  339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000). Thus, if the State presents direct \r\n  or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove guilt, or \r\n  from which guilt can be logically deduced, the directed verdict motion is properly \r\n  denied. State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001). On the \r\n  other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails \r\n  to produce evidence of the offense charged. State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. \r\n  316, 555 S.E.2d 402 (2001); McHoney, 344 S.C. at 97, 544 S.E.2d at 36. \r\n  \r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nSmith argues the trial court should have granted his motion \r\n  for directed verdict because the State failed to present evidence that he and \r\n  his co-defendants assembled with the common purpose \r\n  and intent of committing an act of violence against Parson. We agree.\r\n\r\nSecond degree lynching, a felony, is defined as \"[a]ny act \r\n  of violence inflicted by a mob upon the body of another person and from which \r\n  death does not result . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-220 (1985); see Knox \r\n  v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000). \"Mob\" is further defined as \r\n  \"the assemblage of two or more persons, without color or authority of law, for \r\n  the premeditated purpose and with the premeditated intent of committing \r\n  an act of violence upon the person of another.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-230 (1985) \r\n  (emphasis added); Knox, 340 S.C. at 84, 530 S.E.2d at 888. Although \"[t]he \r\n  common intent to do violence\" may be formed before or during the assemblage, \r\n  State v. Barksdale, 311 S.C. 210, 214, 428 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. \r\n  1993), to sustain a conviction for lynching the State must produce at least \r\n  some evidence of premeditation. See Â§ 16-3-230; Barksdale, 311 \r\n  S.C. at 214, 428 S.E.2d at 501 (\"The State is required to prove every element \r\n  of the crime for which an accused is charged.\"). \r\n\r\nPremeditation connotes \"willful deliberation and planning\" \r\n  or \"conscious consideration\" preceding a particular act. Black's Law Dictionary \r\n  1199 (7th ed. 1999); see also Webster's New World College Dictionary  \r\n  1134 (4th ed. 1999) (defining legal definition of premeditation as \"a degree \r\n  of planning and forethought sufficient to show intent to commit an act\"). By \r\n  definition then, the premeditated purpose and intent underlying a charge of \r\n  lynching cannot be spontaneous. \r\n\r\nAt trial, the State called three witnesses who testified \r\n  to the assault on Parson: Parson himself; Tina Hughes, an eyewitness; and Lavonne \r\n  Hanna, Smith's girlfriend and co-defendant. Parson's testimony revealed he was \r\n  talking to Moore when Smith inexplicably said \"You don't know me like that . \r\n  . . \" and began hitting him. According to Parson, after Smith struck him he \r\n  saw \"Tori Rawlinson come across and hit me\" and he fell to the ground. When \r\n  Parson attempted to get up, Hanna, who had exited the truck, raised her hand \r\n  and cut him. \r\n\r\nHughes essentially confirmed Parson's account, testifying \r\n  that after Parson \"mumbled something,\" Smith made the \"you don't know me\" remark, \r\n  got out of the truck, and hit Parson in the mouth. Hughes further testified \r\n  Rawlinson then \"came in and hit [Parson] in the back of the head. And when [Parson] \r\n  had fell, that's when [Hanna] came with the blade and started cutting him.\" \r\n  Although Hanna testified she and Smith struck Parson in self-defense, she also \r\n  stated Parson initially approached Smith and asked if he was interested in buying \r\n  some crack or \"weed.\" In Hanna's account, that was when Smith replied: \"Man, \r\n  you don't even know me like that to ask me something like that.\"\r\n\r\nThus, all of the testimonial evidence presented by the State \r\n  indicated Smith became upset at something Parson said, jumped out of the truck, \r\n  and hit him. Moreover, it was undisputed Rawlinson came over from across \r\n  the street and hit Parson in the back of the head; he neither arrived with \r\n  Smith and Hanna nor was with them when the incident began. Finally, the evidence \r\n  showed that as Smith and Rawlinson independently attacked Parson, Hanna exited \r\n  the truck and cut Parson with an unknown weapon. In other words, the combined \r\n  testimony evinced an impulsive attack on Parson by Smith that Rawlinson and \r\n  Hanna later joined. \r\n\r\nThese facts distinguish this case from Barksdale, supra, \r\n  in which this Court upheld several convictions for first degree lynching following \r\n  an altercation outside a nightclub. In Barksdale, the defendants were \r\n  involved in a verbal confrontation in which the victim intervened. Afterward, \r\n  \"[a]lthough the [defendants] started to leave, they decided to return and \r\n  fight with [the victim].\" Barksdale, 311 S.C. at 212, 428 S.E.2d \r\n  at 499 (emphasis added). The defendants then took turns assaulting the victim, \r\n  and the victim later died from his injuries. On appeal, the State successfully \r\n  argued that the defendants' intent in assembling was transformed from a lawful \r\n  purpose to an unlawful one as \"evidenced by the fact [they] returned to \r\n  the club with the expressed purpose and intent to commit an act \r\n  of violence upon the victim.\" Id. at 215, 428 S.E.2d at 501 (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n\r\nWhile we agree the State may demonstrate the intent element \r\n  in a lynching case through \"positive\" testimonial evidence or circumstantial \r\n  inferences, id. at 214, 428 S.E.2d at 500, the record before us is devoid \r\n  of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, tending to prove Smith, Hanna, and \r\n  Rawlinson acted with the premeditated purpose and intent required to sustain \r\n  a conviction. Accordingly, as Smith and his co-defendants did not constitute \r\n  a \"mob\" within the meaning of the lynching statute, Smith's conviction for second \r\n  degree lynching is \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Upon examination at the hospital, \r\n  Parson registered a blood alcohol content of .23 percent. A trial expert testified \r\n  that level of intoxication would render someone of Parson's size significantly \r\n  impaired. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3568","title":"Hopkins v.

Hopkins appeals a circuit court order dismissing this action \r\n  based on his alleged failure to mediate the matter as required by a prior court \r\n  order.Â  Hopkins asserts the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal was error because (1) \r\n  this action was filed prior to the effective date of the rules for mediation \r\n  and arbitration established by the South Carolina Supreme Court, and (2) he \r\n  was not given proper notice of the motion to dismiss.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action arises out of Hopkinsâ€™s \r\n  purchase of a home in the Vintage Place Development (Phase II) in Florence County.Â  \r\n  The home was constructed by Robert F. Harrell, Jr., the general contractor, \r\n  and a subcontractor, Miles Heating and Air Conditioning.Â  In March 1996, Hopkins \r\n  brought this action against both Harrell and Miles alleging the home was improperly \r\n  constructed.Â  \r\nBy letter dated May 18, 1998, \r\n  Harrellâ€™s counsel notified Hopkins that this action was included on a list of \r\n  cases to be tried that week and that â€œ[w]e appeared Monday morning before Judge \r\n  Breeden and he has ordered this matter to mediation.â€Â  Counsel noted, â€œApparently \r\n  what happened is that the mediator was appointed on the declaratory judgment \r\n  case but never was appointed on this matter.â€Â  Counsel asked Hopkins to sign \r\n  an enclosed stipulation of mediator selection form naming Karl Folkens as the \r\n  mediator or to submit the names of two or three other potential mediators.Â  \r\n  \r\nUpon receiving no response, Harrellâ€™s \r\n  counsel sent a second letter to Hopkins on July 8, 1998 reminding him of Judge \r\n  Breedenâ€™s order requiring mediation and advising him that he had not received \r\n  the stipulation form selecting a mediator.Â  Harrellâ€™s counsel thereafter sent \r\n  Hopkins similar letters on July 30, 1998 and again on August 25, 1998 reminding \r\n  him of the mediation order and requesting a response.Â \r\nOn September 18, 1998, Harrell \r\n  filed a motion to dismiss the action based on Hopkinsâ€™s failure to comply with \r\n  the order requiring mediation.Â  On October 6, 1998, Judge James Brogdon held \r\n  a hearing on Harrellâ€™s motion to dismiss that was attended by both Hopkins and \r\n  Harrell. [1] Â  Judge Brogdon issued \r\n  an order on November 9, 1998, stating:Â  â€œAfter hearing from all parties and \r\n  [reviewing] the clerkâ€™s file, it appears to this court that the mediation previously \r\n  ordered by [Judge Breeden] has not been carried out by the parties.â€Â  Judge \r\n  Brogdon noted that Hopkins had failed to respond to requests for discovery and \r\n  that discovery should be completed before meaningful mediation could occur.Â  \r\n  Judge Brogdon ordered the matter to be scheduled for mediation before Karl Folkens \r\n  within thirty days of completing discovery, and provided if Hopkins failed to \r\n  abide by the terms of this order, the matter would be dismissed.\r\nOn December 3, 1998, Harrellâ€™s \r\n  counsel discovered the designated mediator, Karl Folkens, might have a conflict \r\n  of interest because he had represented Hopkins in a real estate transaction, \r\n  and he informed Hopkins, Folkens, and Judge Brogdon of the conflict.Â  On March \r\n  9, 1999, Harrellâ€™s counsel wrote to Hopkins to inform him that he had appeared \r\n  at a roster meeting before Judge Floyd and had advised the court that the matter \r\n  had not been mediated because of the conflict.Â  Judge Floyd directed the clerk \r\n  of court to assign a mediator.Â  \r\nEventually another mediator was \r\n  assigned, and the case was scheduled for mediation on June 25, 1999.Â  This date \r\n  was rescheduled to July 15, 1999 and notice was sent to all parties on June \r\n  10th.Â  Hopkins failed to appear at the mediation meeting on July 15th and did \r\n  not provide notice to either the mediator or Harrell that he would not be in \r\n  attendance.Â  On July 20, 1999, Harrell filed another motion to dismiss based \r\n  on Hopkinsâ€™s failure to comply with Judge Brodgonâ€™s order of November 9, 1998 \r\n  regarding discovery and mediation.Â  The same day, Harrellâ€™s counsel filed a \r\n  certificate of mailing with the circuit court verifying the motion had been \r\n  mailed to Hopkins on that date.Â  \r\nA hearing on Harrellâ€™s motion \r\n  to dismiss was held by Judge Brogdon.Â  Hopkins appeared at the hearing and argued \r\n  the motion should not be heard because he allegedly did not receive notice of \r\n  the motion.Â  Hopkins further argued the action should not be dismissed because \r\n  he did not intentionally fail to attend the mediation on July 15, 1999.Â  Hopkins \r\n  informed the court that he had been on vacation and the envelope containing \r\n  the notice had been mistakenly placed inside a magazine.Â  Hopkins maintained \r\n  he did not find the notice of the mediation meeting until some three hours after \r\n  the mediation was scheduled.Â  \r\nOn September 9, 1999, Judge Brogdon \r\n  filed an order dismissing the case with prejudice.Â  The court concluded Hopkins \r\n  had failed to comply with the November 9, 1998 order directing the parties to \r\n  complete discovery and schedule mediation.Â  The court noted the case had been \r\n  pending since 1996 and Hopkins had made no effort to arrange mediation, nor \r\n  had he responded to any attempts by Harrell to schedule the mediation.Â  Hopkins \r\n  appeals from the dismissal order.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nHopkins first asserts the circuit \r\n  court erred in dismissing this action because it did not have the authority \r\n  to order the parties to engage in mediation.Â  He contends the action was filed \r\n  on March 8, 1996 and therefore was not subject to the mandatory Circuit Court \r\n  Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules established by the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court because the rules are applicable only to cases filed on or after March \r\n  15, 1996.\r\nWe conclude this argument is \r\n  not properly before us for consideration on appeal.Â  There is no indication \r\n  in the record that Hopkins ever appealed the ruling requiring mediation or that \r\n  he ever raised this issue to the circuit court during the three years the case \r\n  was pending until after the action was dismissed.Â  Hopkins never made this argument \r\n  at the hearing held on Harrellâ€™s motion to dismiss and only belatedly raised \r\n  the issue in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment. [2] Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, we reject Hopkinsâ€™s \r\n  contention that the argument is nevertheless appropriate for review because \r\n  it involves a question of subject matter jurisdiction, which can be raised at \r\n  any time.Â  â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is â€˜the power to hear and determine \r\n  cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€™â€ [3] Â  It is clear the circuit court \r\n  had subject matter jurisdiction to hear and determine this type of action, which \r\n  sought damages for the defective construction of a home. \r\n  [4] Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error in this regard.\r\nII.\r\nHopkins next argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in hearing Harrellâ€™s motion to dismiss because he did not receive \r\n  proper notice of the motion.\r\nÂ \r\nRule 5(a) of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure requires every written motion to be served upon all \r\n  of the parties. [5] Â  The rule further provides service may be accomplished \r\n  by mailing the motion to the last known address of the party. \r\n  [6] Â \r\nHarrellâ€™s motion to dismiss is \r\n  accompanied by a certificate of mailing filed with the circuit court which indicates \r\n  the motion was mailed to Hopkins on July 20, 1999.Â  The circuit court noted \r\n  the certificate of service by mail was proper and that Hopkins had admittedly \r\n  received a similar motion to dismiss from the co-defendant, Miles, raising the \r\n  same grounds.Â  We find no reversible error in the circuit courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that service was properly made in this case. \r\n  [7] Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  \r\n    Miles eventually settled with Hopkins and is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  See, e.g., Wilder Corp. v.

We reverse.\r\n  FACTS\r\n  Sarratt was arrested \r\n    for yelling profanities at Franklin Keith Hembree and his mother, June Hembree, \r\n    as they left the Landrum Municipal Court and walked across the municipal parking \r\n    lot.Â  Franklin testified Sarratt called him a crack head, loudly yelled profanities, \r\n    and called his mother a â€œbitch.â€Â  June testified Sarratt called her names \r\n    and used the â€œfâ€ word. \r\n  ISSUE\r\n  Whether the circuit court erred in reversing \r\n    Sarrattâ€™s conviction, finding that although Sarratt used profanity in a public \r\n    place, profane language alone is insufficient to constitute a violation of \r\n    the public disorderly conduct statute.Â Â  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  â€œIn criminal appeals \r\n    from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de \r\n    novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate \r\n    exception.Â  In reviewing criminal cases, this court may review errors of law \r\n    only.â€ State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. \r\n    App. 2001) (internal citations omitted), cert. denied, Mar. 22, 2002 \r\n    .\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530 provides: \r\n \r\n  Any person who shall \r\n    (a) be found on any highway or at any public place or public gathering in \r\n    a grossly intoxicated condition or otherwise conducting himself in a disorderly \r\n    or boisterous manner, (b) use obscene or profane language on any highway or \r\n    at any public place or gathering or in hearing distance of any schoolhouse \r\n    or church . . . shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction \r\n    shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars or be imprisoned for not \r\n    more than thirty days.\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-530 \r\n    (1985). The circuit court found that â€œprofane language alone cannot constitute \r\n    a violation of the public disorderly conduct statute in light of the First \r\n    Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.â€ Rather, the circuit court \r\n    found that profane language must be accompanied by fighting words or other \r\n    behavior such as gross intoxication. \r\n  The First Amendment \r\n    prohibits laws that abridge the freedom of speech. U.S. Const. amend. I;Â  \r\n    S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 2. There are, however, certain classes of speech that \r\n    are not afforded the protection of the First Amendment.Â  Chaplinsky v. \r\n    New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-72 (1942). \r\n  One such class of \r\n    speech, fighting words, is defined as words that â€œby their very utterance \r\n    inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.â€ Id. \r\n    at 572. Fighting words must be inherently likely to induce the ordinary person \r\n    to react violently. Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 20 (1971).Â Â  \r\n    The fact that words are vulgar or offensive is not alone sufficient to classify \r\n    them as fighting words, thereby removing them from the protection provided \r\n    by the First Amendment. See Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, \r\n    527 (1972) (striking Georgia statute that, as construed, prohibited the use \r\n    of words that disgraced or insulted the listener, but did not constitute fighting \r\n    words); In re Louise C., 3 P.3d 1004, 1005-07 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1999) \r\n    (holding juvenileâ€™s use of â€œfâ€ word in argument with principal and another \r\n    student over whether student had cheated her out of money, although offensive \r\n    and unacceptable, did not constitute fighting words); Ware v. City &amp; \r\n    County of Denver, 511 P.2d 475, 475-76 (Colo. 1973) (stating â€œone manâ€™s \r\n    vulgarity is anotherâ€™s lyricâ€ and holding defendantâ€™s statement â€œf--- youâ€ \r\n    during political speech at university not fighting words); Downs v. State, \r\n    366 A.2d 41, 42-46 (Md. 1976) (stating the defendantâ€™s use of profanity and \r\n    racial epithets in crowded, noisy restaurant in loud voice to fellow diners \r\n    not fighting words as not directed to anyone in particular; finding the use \r\n    of the â€œfâ€ word not punishable absent compelling reasons); City of Bismarck \r\n    v. Schoppert, 469 N.W.2d 808, 811 (N.D. 1991) (in finding â€œf--- youâ€ not \r\n    fighting words the court stated: â€œIt is . . . not a crime in this country \r\n    to be a boor, absent resort to fighting words.â€).Â  \r\n  However, the determination \r\n    of whether profane words constitute fighting words depends upon the circumstances \r\n    surrounding their utterance. Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S \r\n    130, 135 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring). Some of the factors to consider \r\n    in determining if profanity constitutes fighting words are the presence of \r\n    bystanders, the accompaniment of other aggressive behavior, and whether the \r\n    words are repeatedly uttered. See State v. Szymkiewicz, 678 \r\n    A.2d 473, 475-79 (Conn. 1996) (finding fighting words where defendant repeatedly \r\n    cursed police officer and store detective and threatened store detective, \r\n    and uproar occurred in front of other customers who congregated to watch); \r\n    State v. Hammersly, 10 P.3d 1285, 1287-89 (Idaho 2000) (finding adult \r\n    in vehicle who yelled â€œshut your f---ing mouth, you b---- . . .â€ to 13 year \r\n    old friend of adultâ€™s daughter and two other preteens on street used fighting \r\n    words); State v. James M., 806 P.2d 1063, 1065-66 (N.M. Ct. App. 1990) \r\n    (holding minorâ€™s repeated yelling of â€œf--- youâ€ while flailing arms and pointing \r\n    at another individual on a public sidewalk as a small crowd congregated constituted \r\n    fighting words); In reÂ  S.J.N-K., 647 N.W.2d 707, 709-12 (S.D. 2002) \r\n    (stating the context in which the language is used must be considered; finding \r\n    minorâ€™s repeated use of â€œf--- youâ€ and middle finger gesture toward a school \r\n    principal and his family in a store parking lot, continuing while minor tailgated \r\n    principal as principal drove away, constituted fighting words).\r\n  Whether a communication \r\n    constitutes fighting words also â€œdepends in large part on the addressee of \r\n    the communications.â€ Aviva O. Wertheimer, The First Amendment Distinction \r\n    Between Conduct and Content: A Conceptual Framework for Understanding Fighting \r\n    Words Jurisprudence, 63 Fordham L. Rev. 793, 813 (1994). In Cohen, \r\n    the defendantâ€™s display of the words â€œF--- the Draftâ€ on the back of his jacket \r\n    were determined not fighting words. 403 U.S. at 20-22. The court determined \r\n    â€œ[n]o individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably have regarded \r\n    the words on [Cohenâ€™s] jacket as a direct personal insult.â€ Id. at \r\n    20. The court explained that fighting words must be directed at someone in \r\n    particular. Id.\r\n  In State v. Perkins, \r\n    our supreme court concluded a conviction under section 16-17-530 required \r\n    more than raised voices. 306 S.C. 353, 355, 412 S.E.2d 385, 386 (1991). Without \r\n    fighting words, the defendants in Perkins could not be convicted. Id. \r\n    Likewise, in State v. Pittman, this court stated if a defendantâ€™s â€œonly \r\n    disorderly behavior had been to use profanity, . . . he could not be arrested \r\n    for public disorderly conduct.â€ 342 S.C. 545, 548, 537 S.E.2d 563, 565 (Ct. \r\n    App. 2000). Both of these cases, however, involved law enforcement personnel \r\n    on the receiving end of the verbal abuse. See Perkins, 306 S.C. \r\n    at 354, 412 S.E.2d at 386 (sheriffâ€™s department employee); Pittman, \r\n    342 S.C. at 546, 537 S.E.2d at 564 (sheriffâ€™s department officer). The Perkins \r\n    court, relying on City of Houston v. Hill, noted the narrow application \r\n    of the fighting words exception in cases involving words addressed to a police \r\n    officer. Perkins, 306 S.C. at 354-55, 412 S.E.2d at 386. See \r\n    City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 462 (1987) (limiting the fighting \r\n    words doctrine when the addressee, as a properly trained police officer, is \r\n    reasonably expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average \r\n    citizen).\r\n  More recently, this \r\n    court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of a defendantâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n    verdict on his charge of disorderly conduct in violation of section 16-17-530. \r\n    State v. LaCoste, 347 S.C. 153, 163-64, 553 S.E.2d 464, 470 (Ct. App. \r\n    2001), cert. granted, Feb. 25, 2002. LaCoste threw up his arms in a \r\n    hostile manner and yelled obscenities at a police officer, insisting he would \r\n    not comply with the officerâ€™s demands.Â  After his arrest, LaCoste repeatedly \r\n    shouted obscenities, challenging the officer, and taunting the officer and \r\n    another officer regarding their lack of success in bringing him under control.Â  \r\n    This court found there was sufficient evidence to enable the trial court to \r\n    deny LaCosteâ€™s motion for directed verdict. Id.\r\n  Applying the fighting \r\n    words doctrine to the facts of this case, we agree with the magistrate and \r\n    conclude Sarrattâ€™s remarks, accompanied with the loud manner in which they \r\n    were spoken, constituted fighting words. We find Sarrattâ€™s language, especially \r\n    once he directed vulgarities at Franklinâ€™s mother, would incite an ordinary \r\n    person to violence.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing Sarrattâ€™s \r\n    conviction is\r\n  REVERSED.\r\n  SHULER, J., concurs.\r\n  HEARN, C.J., dissents \r\n    in separate opinion.\r\n  HEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â Â  \r\n    Because I disagree with the majority that the evidence supports the \r\n    finding that the statements uttered by Sarratt constitute fighting words, \r\n    I respectfully dissent. \r\n  The United States \r\n    Supreme Court has recognized the power of states to punish fighting words \r\n    under carefully drawn statutes which do not infringe upon protected forms \r\n    of speech.Â  Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 523, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1107 \r\n    (1972).Â  The Court defines fighting words as â€œthose which by their very utterance \r\n    inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.â€Â  Chaplinsky \r\n    v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769 (1942).Â  The majority \r\n    correctly recognizes that the vulgarity or offensiveness of words is not by \r\n    itself sufficient to classify them as fighting words.Â  Wilson, 405 \r\n    U.S. at 527, 92 S.Ct. at 1108.Â  However, the majority holds the language used \r\n    by Sarratt constituted fighting words finding that an ordinary person would \r\n    be incited to violence in light of the comments made by Sarratt, the tone \r\n    in which they were spoken, and the fact that vulgarities were directed at \r\n    Mrs. Hembree.Â  I believe the majority incorrectly reaches this conclusion \r\n    because there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Sarrattâ€™s comments \r\n    had any effect on the Hembrees other than to offend them.Â  Absent evidence \r\n    that Sarrattâ€™s statements tended to cause the Hembrees to react violently, \r\n    his words do not fall within the narrowly tailored exception to protected \r\n    speech set forth in Chaplinsky.\r\n  Cases interpreting \r\n    Chaplinsky have made it clear that states may only prohibit speech \r\n    that has â€œa direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to \r\n    whom, individually, the remark is addressed.â€Â  Wilson, 405 U.S. \r\n    at 524, 92 S.Ct. at 1107 (emphasis added). See also Diehl v. State, \r\n    294 Md. 466, 474-75, 451 A.2d 115, 120 (1982) (stating fighting words are \r\n    those that â€œwould produce an uncontrollable impulse to violence . . .â€).Â  \r\n    â€œIn effect, â€˜fightingâ€™ words have been recognized as having some social value \r\n    and are punishable now not on a â€˜per seâ€™ basis, but only when there is a likelihood \r\n    of imminent disturbance.â€Â  Downs v. State, 278 Md. 610, 615, 366 A.2d \r\n    41, 44 (1976) (citations omitted).Â  The mere use of profane or unpopular language \r\n    is not enough.Â  â€œLanguage likely to offend the sensibility of some listeners \r\n    is now fairly commonplace in many social gatherings as well as in public performances.â€Â  \r\n    Eaton v. City of Tusla, 415 U.S. 697, 700, 94 S.Ct. 1228, 1231 (1974) \r\n    (Powell, J., concurring).Â  This is the very nature of free speech in our society.Â  \r\n    The Supreme Court of Minnesota recognized the inherent difficulty in determining \r\n    the relative offensiveness of any particular expression.Â  The court stated,\r\n  To begin with, curses, oaths, \r\n    expletives, . . . and the whole vocabulary of insults are not intended or \r\n    susceptible of literal interpretation.Â  They are expressions of annoyance \r\n    and hostility â€“ nothing more.Â  To attach greater significance to them is stupid, \r\n    ignorant, or naive.Â  Their significance is emotional, and it is not merely \r\n    immeasurable but variable.Â  \r\n  City of Saint Paul v. Morris, \r\n    258 Minn. 467, 481, 104 N.W.2d 902, 910 (1960).Â  The court further noted that \r\n    the emotional quality of words varies from time to time, from region to region, \r\n    and as between social and cultural groups.Â  Id.\r\n  Before one may be punished \r\n    for spoken words, there must be evidence that the abusive utterance itself \r\n    tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace.Â  See Downs, \r\n    278 Md. at 618, 366 A.2d at 46 (â€œAnd, even if someone were offended by [the \r\n    abusive statement], there was no evidence that any person was so aroused as \r\n    to respond in a violent manner.â€).Â  The State may not assume that provocative \r\n    expressions will incite such violence.Â  Rather, the State must carefully consider \r\n    the surrounding circumstances to determine â€œwhether the expression â€˜is directed \r\n    to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or \r\n    produce such action.â€™â€Â  Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S.Ct. \r\n    2533, 2542 (1989) (refusing to accept the Stateâ€™s argument that it need only \r\n    demonstrate a potential for breach of the peace). Certainly, words may convey \r\n    anger and frustration and yet not rise to a level such as to provoke a violent \r\n    reaction from the listener.Â  Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. \r\n    130, 135, 94 S.Ct. 970, 973 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring).Â  It is not enough \r\n    that the words merely arouse anger or resentment.Â  See Skelton v. \r\n    City of Birmingham, 342 So.2d 933, 937 (Ala. Crim. App. 1976).\r\n  Here, the record shows only that a verbal exchange \r\n    occurred between the parties during which profanity was used.Â  Upon finding \r\n    Sarratt guilty, the magistrate stated, â€œOn the charge of public disorderly \r\n    conduct the way I understand the law . . . is that it was loud and boisterous, \r\n    there was cursing and all this . . . .â€Â  The magistrate makes no finding that \r\n    there was an imminent risk of violence resulting from Sarrattâ€™s statements \r\n    nor does the record suggest that any party involved was incited to react violently.Â  \r\n    Moreover, the officer who arrested Sarratt did so based only on statements \r\n    given to him by the Hembrees, and he did not personally observe the altercation.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, it is impossible for the officer to have assessed whether the \r\n    comments made by Sarratt, and circumstances under which they were made, were \r\n    so abusive towards the Hembrees that an immediate violent reaction was imminent.Â  \r\n    See State v. James, 111 N.M. 473, 475, 806 P.2d 1063, 1065 (N.M. \r\n    Ct. App. 1990) (considering the fact that the arresting officer felt it necessary \r\n    to step between the arguing parties as evidence that a fight was likely to \r\n    ensue).Â Â  \r\n  While this court may find it deplorable that Sarratt \r\n    directed abusive language towards Mr. Hembree and his mother, we must not \r\n    predicate a conviction for such conduct on our view of poor taste.Â  Instead, \r\n    the evidence must show that there was an imminent risk of violent reaction \r\n    to Sarrattâ€™s language.Â  In the absence of such evidence, Sarrattâ€™s expressions, \r\n    although profane in nature, are entitled to the protection granted by the \r\n    First Amendment to the Constitution.Â  Accordingly, I would affirm the circuit \r\n    courtâ€™s order reversing Sarrattâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3570","title":"SCDSS v.

Kohn, \r\n          of Columbia; for Appellant\r\nMontford Shuler Caughman, of Lexington; for \r\n  Respondent.\r\nAnn Sharry Keisler, of Lexington; for Guardian Ad Litem\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:Â  \r\n  Angela Meek (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s decision to grant temporary \r\n  custody of her two minor daughters to the South Carolina Department of Social \r\n  Services (DSS).Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 20, 2000, \r\n  the Lexington County Department of Social Services sought an ex parte order \r\n  granting it temporary emergency physical custody of the two daughters of Mother \r\n  and Michael Meek (Father).Â  The family court found that Father, while holding \r\n  a firearm, threatened to kill one of the children.Â  He then shot the firearm \r\n  in the home while fighting with Mother.Â  The family court also found Mother \r\n  was not willing to leave the home to protect herself or the two girls.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the family court granted temporary emergency custody of the girls to DSS, finding \r\n  probable cause existed to believe there was imminent and substantial danger \r\n  to the life, health, or physical safety of the children.Â Â  \r\nThe probable cause hearing was held on April 24, \r\n  2000, and the family court made a finding that probable cause existed to take \r\n  the children into emergency protective custody.Â  The family court awarded custody \r\n  of the girls to DSS and ordered both Mother and Father to undergo psychological \r\n  testing.Â  The family court scheduled the merits hearing for May 24, 2000.Â  However, \r\n  the hearing was continued because no guardian ad litem had been appointed.Â  \r\n  The order granting the continuance noted a waiver of the thirty-five-day statutory \r\n  period for the hearing.Â Â  \r\nThe court conducted \r\n  a merits hearing on August 2, 2000.Â  Mother appeared at the hearing with her \r\n  attorney, and the parties announced they had reached an agreement.Â  DSS indicated \r\n  that no agreement had been reached with Father, and a hearing would be held \r\n  regarding him sometime in the future.Â Â  \r\nDSS announced to \r\n  the family court the agreement reached with Mother.Â  The parties agreed, among \r\n  other things, to a finding of physical neglect against Mother, the return of \r\n  custody of the two girls to Mother, and to continued monitoring by DSS. After \r\n  DSS stated the substance of the agreement on the record, the following exchange \r\n  took place:\r\n\r\n[DSS]: Additionally, Your Honor, I will add that [Father], \r\n  who is accompanied by his attorney, has no objections to custody being returned \r\n  to Mrs. Meek.\r\n[Court]: What about a restraint as to his contact?\r\n[DSS]: He is in agreement with that, as well, Your Honor.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    . . .\r\n[Court]: So heâ€™s not to have any contact with these children?\r\n[Fatherâ€™s attorney]:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  No, sir.\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . .\r\n[Court]: She understands she cannot have [Father] around \r\n  these children?\r\n[Motherâ€™s attorney]:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, she understands \r\n  that.\r\n\r\nThe family court approved the agreement.Â  However, \r\n  the August 29, 2000, written order (Motherâ€™s Order) failed to include the directive \r\n  that Mother keep the girls away from Father. \r\nSubsequently, Mother \r\n  informed the DSS case worker that she was pregnant with Fatherâ€™s child.Â  As \r\n  a result of contact between Father and the children, Mother signed a Voluntary \r\n  Placement Agreement, agreeing to give custody of the two girls to DSS for a \r\n  temporary period.Â  The agreement provided that DSS â€œmay petition the \r\n  Family Court for custody of my child(ren) at any time it deems such action necessary \r\n  or should continued placement be necessary beyond three (3) months.â€ The agreement \r\n  also provided that Mother could request the return of her children by informing \r\n  DSS of her request fifteen days before the date she wished them returned, but \r\n  DSS could petition the family court for an order preventing the return of the \r\n  children if DSS believed it was in the best interest of the children. \r\nThe court finally \r\n  held the merits hearing regarding Father on March 5, 2001.Â  Neither Mother nor \r\n  her attorney appeared at the hearing.Â  In addressing Fatherâ€™s failure to stay \r\n  away from the children, one witness testified that Mother told DSS she was pregnant \r\n  by Father.Â  At the end of the hearing, the family court found that Father placed \r\n  the children in threat of harm of physical abuse and mental injury.Â  The court \r\n  further ordered that Father be entered in the child abuse registry.Â  Finally, \r\n  the family court granted DSSâ€™s request that the children remain in its custody.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn March 27, 2001, \r\n  without a hearing, the family court issued an order amending Motherâ€™s Order.Â  \r\n  The amended order added two provisions. One stated that Mother understood that \r\n  Father was not to have contact with the children, and another forbade Father \r\n  from contacting them.Â  It is not clear from the record when Mother was served \r\n  with a copy of this order.Â  The family court also issued an intervention order \r\n  regarding Father (Fatherâ€™s Order) on April 11, 2001, finding that Father placed \r\n  the children in threat of harm and that he should have no contact with the children.Â  \r\n  Fatherâ€™s Order did not address Motherâ€™s conduct or custody of the children.Â  \r\n\r\nOn August 1, 2001, \r\n  Mother sent a written request for the return of her children pursuant to the \r\n  agreement she had signed with DSS.Â  On August 8, 2001, without a hearing, the \r\n  family court issued an amended Fatherâ€™s Order.Â  The amended Fatherâ€™s Order provided \r\n  that DSS should have continued temporary custody of the children because Mother \r\n  failed to comply with a previous court order.Â  Mother appeals from this order, \r\n  arguing: (1) the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because DSSâ€™s \r\n  complaint did not include the required statutory notices; (2) the family court \r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the merits hearing was not held within \r\n  the statutory time constraints; and (3) Mother was unlawfully deprived of her \r\n  children and denied her constitutional due process rights because DSS failed \r\n  to give her notice or a hearing regarding the amended orders. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from \r\n  family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance \r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  McElveen v. McElveen, \r\n  332 S.C. 583, 591, 506 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\nMother argues the \r\n  family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying proceedings \r\n  because: (1) the initial emergency removal complaint lacked adequate statutory \r\n  notices; and (2) her merits hearing was not held within the statutory time constraints.\r\nA. COMPLAINT\r\nMother first claims \r\n  the family court was divested of subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint \r\n  for removal served on her did not contain the statutorily-required notices.Â  \r\n\r\nThe family court has \r\n  exclusive jurisdiction to hear matters concerning the abuse and neglect of children.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(A) (Supp. 2001). \r\n  [1] Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDSS served Mother \r\n  with a copy of the Complaint for the Ex Parte Order.Â  The complaint identified \r\n  the children, identified Mother and Father, and alleged there was probable cause \r\n  to believe there existed a substantial threat to the childrenâ€™s life, health, \r\n  or safety at the hands of Mother and Father.Â  The complaint sought the emergency \r\n  removal of the children from the parentsâ€™ custody.Â  \r\nThe General Assembly \r\n  has required that certain notices be placed in petitions for removal:\r\n\r\n   (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Whether or not the petition for removal includes a petition for termination \r\n    of parental rights, the petition shall contain a notice informing the parents \r\n    of the potential effect of the hearing on their parental rights and a notice \r\n    to all interested parties that objections to the sufficiency of a placement \r\n    plan, if ordered, or of any recommendations for provisions in the plan or \r\n    court order must be raised at the hearing.Â  The notice must be printed in \r\n    boldface print or in all upper case letters and set off in a box. \r\n. . .\r\nIf the petition does not include a petition for termination \r\n  of parental rights, the notice shall state:Â  â€œAt this hearing the court may \r\n  order a treatment plan.Â  If you fail to comply with the plan, you could lose \r\n  your rights as a parent.â€\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(D) (Supp. 2001).Â  The complaint \r\n  served on Mother did not contain any of the notices outlined in the statute.Â  \r\n  However, Mother did not complain about this failure before the family court.\r\nMother argues that \r\n  although the family court has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to hear \r\n  cases involving child abuse and neglect, the court was divested of this jurisdiction \r\n  when DSS failed to include the necessary notices in the complaint.Â  It is clear \r\n  that DSS failed to include the necessary notices.Â  However, nothing in the statute \r\n  purports to divest the family court of subject matter jurisdiction where the \r\n  notice requirements are not met by DSS.\r\nÂ \r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction \r\n  is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to \r\n  which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. \r\n  139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000).Â  DSSâ€™s failure to include the appropriate \r\n  notices in the complaint for removal may have violated certain due process rights \r\n  of Mother, but the failure did not deprive the family court of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over the emergency protective removal proceedings concerning Motherâ€™s \r\n  children.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 \r\n  S.C. 129, 134-35, 538 S.E.2d 285, 288 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe law provides the \r\n  family court has exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings involving the termination \r\n  of parental rights.Â  We are aware of no provision divesting the court of that \r\n  jurisdiction based on alleged improper removal of a child.â€) (internal citation \r\n  omitted).\r\nMoreover, since \r\n  the failure of DSS to include the necessary notices in the complaint for removal \r\n  does not involve a question of subject matter jurisdiction, this issue should \r\n  have been raised to the family court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, \r\n  330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998) (stating an issue cannot be raised for the \r\n  first time on appeal).\r\nB. TIME LIMITS\r\nMother next argues \r\n  the family court was divested of subject matter jurisdiction to hear this matter \r\n  because the family court failed to hold the merits hearing within the statutorily \r\n  required time limits.Â  \r\nDSS brought the \r\n  emergency action to remove the girls from Motherâ€™s custody on April 20, 2000.Â  \r\n  The family court held a probable cause hearing on April 24, 2000, and scheduled \r\n  the merits hearing for May 24, 2000.Â  On this date, DSS notified the family \r\n  court that a guardian ad litem had not been appointed.Â  The family court issued \r\n  an order continuing the matter for this reason.Â  The order specified that the \r\n  thirty-five-day time limit had been waived.Â  Nothing in the record indicates \r\n  whether Mother appeared before the family court on May 24, 2000, or whether \r\n  she agreed to waive the thirty-five-day time limit.Â  Motherâ€™s merits hearing \r\n  was held on August 2, 2000.Â  Mother entered into an agreement with DSS at the \r\n  hearing and did not object to the timing of the hearing.Â  \r\nThe General Assembly \r\n  has provided strict timelines for hearings on the removal of children.Â  â€œThe \r\n  family court shall schedule a probable cause hearing to be held within seventy-two \r\n  hours of the time the child was taken into emergency protective custody.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610(M) (Supp. 2001).Â  Further, the merits hearing â€œto determine \r\n  whether removal of custody is needed, pursuant to Section 20-7-736, must be \r\n  held within thirty-five days of the date of receipt of the removal petition.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  A continuance may be granted for exceptional circumstances, however, \r\n  â€œthe hearing on the merits must be completed within sixty-five days following \r\n  receipt of the removal petitionâ€ if a continuance is granted.Â  Id.Â  Section \r\n  20-7-736 also provides that the family court shall â€œschedule a hearing to be \r\n  held within thirty-five daysâ€ of the date of receipt of the removal petition.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(E) (Supp. 2001).\r\nIn reviewing the \r\n  time limits outlined by statute, our Supreme Court has stated that the family \r\n  court â€œmust strictly comply with this schedule of hearings.Â  The family court \r\n  should order custody be returned to the childâ€™s parent or legal guardian if \r\n  the hearings are not held within ten days after the statutory time limits.â€Â  \r\n  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 289, 513 S.E.2d 358, 363 (1999).Â  \r\nMore recently, \r\n  in South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Gamble, 337 S.C. 428, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  477 (Ct. App. 1999), this Court reviewed the time limits described in the removal \r\n  statutes.Â  Gambleâ€™s minor child was removed from her home and placed into emergency \r\n  protective custody after a report of suspected abuse.Â  The family court scheduled \r\n  the merits hearing for September 15, thirty-two days after the petition for \r\n  removal was filed.Â  However, on the day of the scheduled merits hearing, the \r\n  family court determined the matter could not be concluded during the allotted \r\n  time and ordered that the matter be rescheduled.Â  Thereafter, Gamble requested \r\n  and received an order allowing discovery.Â  The merits hearing was held on November \r\n  5, but was not concluded.Â  Gamble then moved to vacate the order granting custody \r\n  to DSS because the merits hearing was not held within thirty-five days of the \r\n  receipt of the removal petition.Â  The family court granted Gambleâ€™s motion to \r\n  dismiss for failure to prosecute, and DSS appealed.Â  This Court compared the \r\n  requirement from section 20-7-610(M) that the merits hearing â€œmust be heldâ€ \r\n  within thirty-five days of receipt of the removal petition with the requirement \r\n  found in section 20-7-736(E) that the family court â€œshall schedule a hearing \r\n  to be held within thirty-five daysâ€ of receipt of the petition for removal.Â  \r\n  Reading the two statutes together, this Court held:\r\n\r\n[T]he plain language of the statute indicates that a merits \r\n  hearing must be scheduled to be held within thirty-five days of receipt \r\n  of the removal petition.Â  The statute does not indicate that the hearing must \r\n  be completed within the thirty-five day period.Â  Therefore the requirement \r\n  that a hearing on the merits actually come to a conclusion within thirty-five \r\n  days of the removal petition should not be read into the statute.\r\n\r\nGamble, 337 S.C. at 432, 523 S.E.2d at 479.Â  \r\nMother argues the family \r\n  court lost subject matter jurisdiction as a result of the failure to abide by \r\n  the time limits mandated by statute.Â  As previously discussed, the family court \r\n  is given exclusive jurisdiction over matters concerning the abuse and neglect \r\n  of children.Â  Although the statutes outlining the time limits for the merits \r\n  hearing indicate that a hearing should at least have been scheduled within thirty-five \r\n  days, and completed within sixty-five days, of the receipt of the removal petition, \r\n  nothing purports to remove jurisdiction over the abuse and neglect case if the \r\n  hearing is not held within these time limits.Â  The failure to complete the merits \r\n  hearing within sixty-five days of receipt of the petition for removal did not \r\n  deprive the family court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  As in Gamble, \r\n  it is clear the family court complied with the statutes considering it originally \r\n  scheduled the merits hearing to be held within thirty-five days of the receipt \r\n  of the removal petition. [2] Â  \r\n  Moreover, the remedy for the failure to complete the hearing within the specified \r\n  time limits was for Mother to petition for the return of her children or move \r\n  to vacate the order granting custody to DSS.Â  Mother did not pursue either action \r\n  and did not raise this issue to the family court. \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nÂ Â  \r\nII. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS\r\nMother argues her \r\n  due process rights were violated and she was unlawfully deprived of custody \r\n  of her children when the family court entered an amended order without giving \r\n  her notice or opportunity to be heard.Â  \r\nâ€œDue process is \r\n  a flexible concept, and the requirements of due process in a particular case \r\n  are dependent upon the importance of the interest involved and the circumstances \r\n  under which the deprivation may occur.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997). Â â€œThe fundamental \r\n  requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time \r\n  and in a meaningful manner.â€Â  Id.Â  Litigants should be placed on notice \r\n  of the issues that the court is to consider in order to comply with due process.Â  \r\n  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 333, 526 S.E.2d 241, 248 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (finding family court erred in addressing issue of debt allocation where \r\n  the husband did not receive notice that the issue would be addressed at the \r\n  hearing on a rule to show cause for failure to pay child support).Â  \r\nThe family court determined \r\n  the merits of the abuse allegations against Mother at the August 2, 2000, hearing.Â  \r\n  The parties clearly indicated that the agreement reached at the hearing dealt \r\n  only with Mother and that the merits of the abuse allegations against Father \r\n  would be dealt with at a later hearing.Â  The Voluntary Placement Agreement (VPA), \r\n  dated January 31, 2001, between DSS and Mother indicated that DSS would petition \r\n  the family court if it believed it necessary to seek further determinations \r\n  regarding custody of the children.Â  This indicates a formal process, with notice \r\n  to interested parties, would be undertaken before a determination would be made \r\n  on the custody of the children.Â  \r\nHowever, DSS did not \r\n  apprise Mother that it would request a finding against her or request the family \r\n  court for continued custody of the children at Fatherâ€™s merits hearing on March \r\n  5, 2001.Â  The family court issued Fatherâ€™s Order on April 11, 2001.Â  This order \r\n  included no findings concerning Mother or custody of the children.Â  After Mother \r\n  followed the procedure outlined in the VPA to request custody of her children, \r\n  Fatherâ€™s Order was amended to continue custody with DSS based on Motherâ€™s violation \r\n  of a previous court order. [4] Â  \r\n  DSS argues the family court was merely correcting â€œclerical errorsâ€ by adding \r\n  information discussed at Fatherâ€™s hearing but not included in the order.Â  There \r\n  is no merit to this argument where the â€œcorrectionâ€ goes to the very heart of \r\n  the violation of Motherâ€™s fundamental right to due process.Â  \r\nMotherâ€™s interest in the custody of her children \r\n  is extraordinarily significant.Â  Motherâ€™s fundamental right to due process entitled \r\n  her to notice that DSS intended to petition the family court for custody of \r\n  the children at Fatherâ€™s hearing.Â  Murdock, 338 S.C. at 333, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 248.Â  Moreover, DSS failed to follow its own procedures outlined in the VPA.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to the VPA, DSS should have petitioned the family court to prevent \r\n  the return of the children upon Motherâ€™s request.Â  Because DSS failed to follow \r\n  the procedures outlined in the VPA, and failed to give Mother notice and an \r\n  opportunity to be heard at Fatherâ€™s merits hearing, we reverse that portion \r\n  of the amended Fatherâ€™s Order which grants custody of the children to DSS based \r\n  upon Motherâ€™s conduct.Â  We remand this matter to the family court for a full \r\n  hearing to determine whether DSS is entitled to custody of the children beyond \r\n  the time limits agreed upon by the parties in the VPA.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, \r\n  the portion of the amended Fatherâ€™s Order addressing custody of the children \r\n  and Motherâ€™s conduct is REVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings \r\n  consistent with this opinion.Â  A hearing on these issues shall be held immediately. \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND \r\n  REMANDED. \r\n\r\nANDERSON and \r\n  STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  Although we recognize this case arose in April 2000, we cite to \r\n    the most current version of the Code throughout this opinion given no substantive \r\n    amendments have been made to the pertinent statutes since this litigation \r\n    began.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  However, as noted, the merits hearing was not completed within \r\n    sixty-five days.Â  Thus, it is not clear that the family court complied with \r\n    the statute in this regard.Â  We make no ruling on whether the failure to complete \r\n    the hearing within this time limit violated the statute in this case.Â  Our \r\n    ruling is limited to whether the time-limit discrepancies deprived the family \r\n    court of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  Because the family courtâ€™s compliance with the statutory time limits \r\n    is not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, Mother should have objected \r\n    to the continuance to preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  Joubert \r\n    v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. \r\n    App. 2000).Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â Â  Presumably, Mother violated the amended Motherâ€™s Order prohibiting \r\n    contact between Father and the children.Â  DSS was aware of this violation \r\n    at the time the parties executed the VPA.Â  Thus, it is questionable why DSS \r\n    sought an amended Fatherâ€™s Order continuing custody of the children with DSS \r\n    based on this violation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3571","title":"Pitts v.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3571\r\nHeard September 11, 2002 â€“ Filed November 25, 2002\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPaul J. Doolittle, of Mt. Pleasant; and Ronald R. Parry, \r\n  of Covington, KY, for appellant.\r\nDavid L. Freeman and J. Theodore Gentry, of Greenville; \r\n  and Joel S. Feldman, of Chicago, IL, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:Â  \r\n  This appeal arises out of Jackson National Life Insurance Companyâ€™s sale of \r\n  preferred and non-preferred whole life insurance polices.Â  Southland Container \r\n  Corporation originally brought this class action suit against Jackson National, \r\n  alleging several causes of action including breach of fiduciary duty/constructive \r\n  fraud; fraudulent concealment and non-disclosure; and unjust enrichment and \r\n  imposition of a constructive trust.Â  William Wade Pitts was later substituted \r\n  as named plaintiff.Â  The circuit court granted Jackson Nationalâ€™s motion to \r\n  dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud causes of action; \r\n  granted Jackson Nationalâ€™s summary judgment motion as to the fraudulent concealment \r\n  claim; and denied Pittsâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to his claim for unjust \r\n  enrichment.Â  Pitts appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\nIn 1990, Southland \r\n  Container Corporation (Southland) purchased â€œkey-manâ€ life insurance on David \r\n  Katt, its president, from Jackson National.Â  Southland purchased an Ultimate \r\n  II policy on Katt.Â  Katt allegedly would have qualified for a less expensive \r\n  Preferred Ultimate II policy, but Southland was not aware of this policy and \r\n  was not informed of it by Jackson Nationalâ€™s agent. Â In a suit filed \r\n  December 1, 1995, Southland Container alleged Jackson National sold it the Ultimate \r\n  II policy when it actually qualified for the Preferred Ultimate II policy.Â  \r\n  The complaint alleged five causes of action:Â  violation of unfair trade practices \r\n  act; breach of fiduciary duty/constructive fraud; negligence; fraudulent concealment \r\n  and non-disclosure; and unjust enrichment and imposition of a constructive trust.Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nSouthland moved \r\n  for class certification, and a class of South Carolina Jackson National policyholders \r\n  who purchased non-preferred Ultimate policies, but would have been qualified \r\n  to purchase preferred policies, was conditionally certified.Â  William Wade Pitts \r\n  was substituted as named plaintiff and class representative in place of Southland \r\n  Container when it became apparent that Katt could not devote the necessary time \r\n  to the litigation.Â Â  \r\nFrom 1985 to 1995, \r\n  Jackson National offered two versions of its whole life insurance policy, the \r\n  Ultimate I and Ultimate II.Â  Jackson National also offered separate, but corresponding \r\n  preferred policies, the Preferred Ultimate I and Preferred Ultimate II.Â  The \r\n  preferred policies had stricter underwriting standards, charged lower premiums, \r\n  and paid the broker a lower commission than the standard policies of equal face \r\n  amounts.Â  Non-preferred policies were available to all insurance applicants, \r\n  while preferred polices were available to â€œa more restrictive pool of insureds \r\n  who [had] above average health, good life expectancy, no recent history of smoking \r\n  and qualif[ied] under factors such as age and amount of insurance.â€Â  Jackson \r\n  Nationalâ€™s underwriting department assessed the insurability of an applicant \r\n  based on the policy requested.Â  Thus, if the applicant qualified for the policy \r\n  in the application, Jackson National would issue that policy without further \r\n  investigation into whether the applicant qualified for a different policy.Â  \r\n  If the applicant did not qualify for the applied-for policy, Jackson National \r\n  would advise if the applicant qualified for a different policy.Â  \r\nPitts purchased \r\n  his insurance through an independent insurance agent, Bruce Loring, with whom \r\n  he had no previous relationship. Â Pitts purchased an Ultimate II policy \r\n  for his daughter and a Preferred Ultimate II policy for himself.Â  Although Pittsâ€™s \r\n  daughter may have qualified for a preferred policy, Loring testified he chose \r\n  to seek a non-preferred policy for her because he believed she would not qualify \r\n  for the preferred policy because of her weight.Â  Jackson National issued both \r\n  policies as applied for, and the policies were accepted and paid for by Pitts.Â  \r\n  The amended complaint alleged Pittsâ€™s daughter qualified for the Preferred Ultimate \r\n  II policy but was issued an Ultimate II policy instead, resulting in damages \r\n  to Pitts. Â Â Â \r\nJackson National \r\n  filed a motion to dismiss all five causes of action.Â  The circuit court dismissed \r\n  the causes of action for unfair trade practices, breach of fiduciary duty, and \r\n  negligence.Â  Both parties moved for reconsideration, and the circuit court also \r\n  dismissed the constructive fraud claim. Â \r\nFollowing discovery, \r\n  Jackson National moved for summary judgment on the fraudulent concealment claim.Â  \r\n  Pitts moved for summary judgment on the equitable claim of unjust enrichment.Â  \r\n  The circuit court granted Jackson Nationalâ€™s motion and denied Pittsâ€™s motion.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nPitts appeals, \r\n  arguing the circuit court erred in dismissing the claims for breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty and constructive fraud, in granting Jackson Nationalâ€™s motion for summary \r\n  judgment on the fraudulent concealment claim, and in denying his motion for \r\n  summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim.Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPitts argues the \r\n  circuit court erred in granting Jackson Nationalâ€™s motions to dismiss the claims \r\n  for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud.Â  Jackson Nationalâ€™s motions \r\n  to dismiss were made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  â€œUnder Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP, a defendant may make a motion to dismiss based on a failure to state \r\n  facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.â€Â  Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999).Â  â€œGenerally, in considering a 12(b)(6) \r\n  motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon allegations set forth \r\n  on the face of the complaint.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œA Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss \r\n  for failure to state a cause of action must be resolved by the trial judge based \r\n  solely on the allegations established in the complaint.â€ Berry v. McLeod, \r\n  328 S.C. 435, 441, 492 S.E.2d 794, 797 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\nIn deciding upon \r\n  Jackson Nationalâ€™s motions to dismiss, the circuit court considered matters \r\n  outside the pleadings.Â  Numerous exhibits were submitted in the memorandum in \r\n  opposition to the motion to dismiss, including a copy of the life insurance \r\n  policy and several tables of policy values.Â  â€œIf on a motion under 12(b)(6) \r\n  matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded, the motion shall \r\n  be treated as one for summary judgment.â€ McDonnell v. Consol. Sch. Dist. \r\n  of Aiken, 315 S.C. 487, 489 n.2, 445 S.E.2d 638, 639 n.2 (1994); see \r\n  Berry, 328 S.C. at 441, 492 S.E.2d at 798 (finding where trial court \r\n  decided Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on matters outside the pleadings, the court \r\n  converted the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion pursuant to Rule \r\n  56, SCRCP). \r\nâ€œ[Rule 12(b)(6)] \r\n  specifically provides for conversion, provided the parties, upon compliance \r\n  with the notice provisions of Rule 56, are afforded a reasonable opportunity \r\n  to introduce evidentiary matters.â€ Johnson v. Dailey, 318 S.C. 318, 321, \r\n  457 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1995).Â  The pertinent portion of Rule 12(b) allowing conversion \r\n  provides: \r\n\r\nIf, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss \r\n  for failure of the pleading to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \r\n  of action, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by \r\n  the Court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed \r\n  of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity \r\n  to present all material pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum \r\n  containing the outside materials was dated and filed on May 28, 1996.Â  The order \r\n  was dated November 25, 1996 and filed November 26, 1996. Â Because the \r\n  judge issued the order six months after the memorandum was filed, there was \r\n  ample opportunity for the parties to introduce additional evidentiary matters \r\n  if they desired.Â  Thus, the circuit court implicitly converted the motions to \r\n  dismiss into summary judgment motions under the provisions of Rule 12(b), SCRCP.Â  \r\n  As such, the procedural posture from which we review these claims is that of \r\n  summary judgment.\r\nSummary judgment \r\n  is proper when it is clear there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \r\n  and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  West v. \r\n  Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 132, 533 S.E.2d 334, 336 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œSummary \r\n  judgment can be granted when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on \r\n  which reasonable minds cannot differ.â€Â  Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, \r\n  445, 415 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1992).\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the \r\n  grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard which \r\n  governs the trial court.â€ Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d \r\n  319, 321 (2001).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, \r\n  the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œOn appeal from an order \r\n  granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, \r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most \r\n  favorable to the non-moving party below.â€Â  Id.  \r\nI.Â  Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nPitts [1]  argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  dismissing the claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Pitts specifically asserts \r\n  â€œJackson National had a fiduciary duty to provide complete and truthful information \r\n  to Appellant and Class members when selling insurance policies to them, and \r\n  it breached that duty when it failed to make full disclosure with respect to \r\n  the type of policies available, the charges, commissions, mortality costs and \r\n  other expenses associated with those policies . . . .â€Â Â Â Â  \r\nPitts, however, \r\n  conceded at oral argument the relationship in this case cannot be considered \r\n  a â€œpureâ€ fiduciary relationship.Â  Instead, he contends the relationship is based \r\n  on the unique circumstances of the sale of insurance, which creates a heightened \r\n  duty, particularly the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\r\nâ€œA confidential \r\n  or fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special confidence in another, \r\n  so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith \r\n  and with due regard to the interests of the one imposing the confidence.â€Â  Island \r\n  Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 599, 358 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987).Â Â Â  A relationship must be more than casual to equal a fiduciary relationship. \r\n  Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 295 S.C. 290, 368 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\n  â€œCourts of equity have carefully refrained from defining the particular instances \r\n  of fiduciary relationship in such a manner that other and perhaps new cases \r\n  might be excluded and have refused to set any bounds to the circumstances out \r\n  of which a fiduciary relationship may spring.â€Â  Island Car Wash, Inc., \r\n  292 S.C. at 599, 358 S.E.2d at 152; see Burwell v. South Carolina \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 41, 340 S.E.2d 786, 790 (1986) (â€œAs a general rule, \r\n  mere respect for anotherâ€™s judgment or trust in his character is usually not \r\n  sufficient to establish such a [fiduciary] relationship.Â  The facts and circumstances \r\n  must indicate that one reposing the trust has foundation for his belief that \r\n  the one giving advice or presenting arguments is acting not in his own behalf, \r\n  but in the interests of the other party.â€).Â  Therefore, to determine whether \r\n  a fiduciary relationship existed between Jackson National and Pitts, we must \r\n  look at the particulars of their relationship.\r\nAlthough the relationship \r\n  between an insurer and an insured has at times been characterized as â€œspecial,â€ \r\n  this has occurred only after the parties have entered into a mutually binding \r\n  contract for insurance, specifically in the posture of an insuredâ€™s claim of \r\n  bad faith refusal to pay benefits due under an insurance contract.Â  The conduct \r\n  at issue in these cases arose based on the insurerâ€™s established contractual \r\n  obligations.Â  See Tadlock Painting Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 322 \r\n  S.C. 498, 503 n.5, 473 S.E.2d 52, 55 n.5 (1996) (â€œThe duty of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing is such a duty that arises by operation of law due to the special \r\n  relationship of the parties in an insurance contract . . . .â€); see also \r\n  Lira v. Shelter Ins. Co., 913 P.2d 514 (Colo. 1996) (holding tort liability \r\n  for breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is based on quasi-fiduciary \r\n  nature of insurance relationship and is predicated on partiesâ€™ contractual responsibilities).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThis case, however, \r\n  requires us to review the context of an insurer/insured relationship from its \r\n  inception, specifically, at the point of the application for insurance.Â  Our \r\n  research reveals no South Carolina case, and the parties have cited none, which \r\n  establishes a fiduciary relationship at the application stage.Â  In fact, our \r\n  Supreme Court has found an applicant for an insurance policy does not stand \r\n  in a fiduciary relationship with the insurer. Gordon v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. \r\n  Co. of N.Y., 238 S.C. 438, 120 S.E.2d 509 (1961) (finding no relationship \r\n  of trust and confidence existed between the insurance applicant and the insurance \r\n  agent); Oâ€™Connor v. Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen, 217 S.C. 442, 60 S.E.2d 884 \r\n  (1950) (holding no relation of trust and confidence existed between the insurance \r\n  applicant and the soliciting agent where they had not known each other prior \r\n  to the transaction and the agent did nothing in preventing the applicant from \r\n  reading the application).Â  \r\nPitts attempts \r\n  to distinguish Gordon and Oâ€™Connor, arguing they are â€œfailure \r\n  to readâ€ cases, in which the information allegedly withheld from the policy \r\n  applicants was disclosed in the written materials supplied to them.Â  Although \r\n  the cases involved a failure on the part of the insured to read the policy, \r\n  they provide guidance in the present case in that the cases clearly establish \r\n  the sale of insurance is an armâ€™s length commercial transaction, which does \r\n  not give rise to a fiduciary relationship.Â  Because an applicant is still operating \r\n  in the marketplace at the point of purchase, the insurer is in a decidedly different \r\n  position than after the contract has been entered into; thus, no heightened \r\n  duty has attached.Â  \r\nWe find additional \r\n  support for this conclusion in the holding of Moses v. Mfrs. Life Ins. Co., \r\n  298 F. Supp. 321 (D.S.C. 1968).Â  In Moses, the insured purchased an annuity \r\n  contract from the insurer.Â  The insured selected the option of monthly payments \r\n  during her life without the guarantee of payment beyond her own life.Â  After \r\n  receiving seven monthly payments, the insured died.Â  Subsequently, the executors \r\n  of her estate sought to have the election voided in an effort to recover under \r\n  a more favorable settlement option, which was not chosen by the insured.Â  The \r\n  executors primarily argued the insurer stood in a fiduciary relationship with \r\n  the insured.Â  Based on this relationship, the executors claimed the insurer \r\n  was required to determine which policy was more favorable to the insured.Â  The \r\n  United States District Court for South Carolina rejected this contention.Â  The \r\n  Court found the executorsâ€™ claim of a fiduciary relationship could not â€œrest \r\n  upon the mere relationship of insurer and insured.â€Â  Moses, 298 F. Supp. \r\n  at 323.Â  \r\nOur decision is \r\n  also consistent with other jurisdictions.Â  See, e.g., Erie Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Hickman, 622 N.E.2d 515, 518 (Ind. 1993) (finding relationship at the \r\n  initial purchase of an insurance policy is that of â€œa traditional arms-length \r\n  dealing between two partiesâ€); Stockett v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., 106 \r\n  A.2d 741, 744 (R.I. 1954) (â€œOrdinarily an insurance company stands in no fiduciary \r\n  relationship to a legally competent applicant for an annuity or other insurance \r\n  contract.â€); Legal Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 373 S.W.2d 693, 697 (Tex. \r\n  App. 1963) (â€œThe legal relations between an applicant and an insurance company \r\n  are fundamentally the same as those between parties negotiating any other contract.â€).\r\nApplying the foregoing \r\n  analysis to the instant case, we note Pitts first contacted Loring through an \r\n  insurance brochure Loring circulated.Â  With Loringâ€™s assistance, Pitts applied \r\n  for a Preferred Ultimate II policy for himself.Â Â  Pitts also completed an application \r\n  for an Ultimate II policy for his daughter.Â  Loring testified he chose to seek \r\n  the non-preferred policy for Pittsâ€™s daughter because he believed she would \r\n  not qualify for the preferred policy because of her weight.Â  When Jackson National \r\n  received Pittsâ€™s application, it determined that Pitts was qualified for the \r\n  Preferred Ultimate II for which he applied, and his daughter was qualified for \r\n  the Ultimate II policy for which she applied.Â  Having determined that both individuals \r\n  qualified for the policies they had applied for, Jackson National issued the \r\n  policies.Â  Pitts alleges his daughter would have received the preferred policy \r\n  if she had applied for it, and Jackson National breached a fiduciary duty by \r\n  not informing him she might qualify for a better policy.Â  This assertion fails \r\n  given no fiduciary relationship was created merely by the application for insurance.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, there is no evidence of a course of dealing or circumstances between \r\n  Jackson National and Pitts that would give rise to a fiduciary duty.Â  See \r\n  14 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance Â§ 198:7, at \r\n  198-16 (3d ed. 1999) (â€œ[A] fiduciary relationship, if one is found to exist, \r\n  flows not from the mere fact of an insurance relationship between the parties; \r\n  something more than the mere fact of an insurance relationship is required to \r\n  establish a fiduciary relationship.â€).Â  Without a fiduciary relationship, Jackson \r\n  National owed no duty to Pitts either to disclose the existence of a preferred \r\n  policy or to perform full underwriting to determine eligibility for a policy \r\n  other than that which was requested.Â Â Â  \r\nDespite the absence \r\n  of a fiduciary relationship, Pitts contends insurance agents should be required \r\n  to disclose product differences in situations where these differences are â€œunknown \r\n  and unknowable to the average consumer.â€Â  Initially, we note there is no evidence \r\n  Loring undertook the obligation to obtain the best policy for Pitts, and absent \r\n  this undertaking, he is not required to do so.Â  See Sullivan Co. v. \r\n  New Swirl, Inc., 313 S.C. 34, 36, 437 S.E.2d 30, 31 (1993) (affirming the \r\n  finding of the trial judge that no obligation exists on the part of an agent \r\n  or broker to secure insurance at the most favorable prices absent a promise \r\n  to do so).Â Â  Moreover, in light of the vast array of available insurance policies, \r\n  including competitorâ€™s policies, it would be impractical to require an agent \r\n  to disclose all of the differences between these policies. \r\nII. Constructive Fraud\r\nPitts argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in dismissing the claim for constructive fraud. Â Pitts contends \r\n  â€œJackson National should have either done full underwriting on all policy applicants \r\n  . . . or disclosed to the Ultimate policy applicants that they were not going \r\n  to receive full underwriting and the effect thereof.â€Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œTo establish constructive fraud, all elements of actual fraud except the element \r\n  of intent must be established.â€ Ardis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 515, 431 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n  Our appellate courts have stated:\r\nIn order to prove [actual] fraud, \r\n  the following elements must be shown: (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; \r\n  (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard \r\n  of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) \r\n  the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; \r\n  (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and \r\n  proximate injury.\r\nId. at 515, 431 S.E.2d \r\n  at 269.Â  \r\nâ€œNeither actual dishonesty \r\n  of purpose nor intent to deceive is an essential element of constructive fraud \r\n  while intent to deceive is an essential element of actual fraud.â€Â  Ardis, 314 \r\n  S.C. at 516, 431 S.E.2d at 269-70.Â  â€œThe presence or absence of such an intent \r\n  distinguishes actual fraud from constructive fraud.â€Â  Id. at 516, 431 S.E.2d \r\n  at 270.Â  â€œHowever, in a constructive fraud case, where there is no confidential \r\n  or fiduciary relationship, and an armâ€™s length transaction between mature, educated \r\n  people is involved, there is no right to rely.â€Â  Id. at 516, 431 S.E.2d at 270. \r\n  \r\nâ€œA complaint is fatally \r\n  defective if it fails to allege all nine elements of fraud.â€Â  Ardis, 314 S.C. \r\n  at 515, 431 S.E.2d at 269.Â  â€œWhere the complaint omits allegations on any element \r\n  of fraud, the trial court should grant the defendantâ€™s motion to dismiss the \r\n  claim.â€ Id.Â  \r\nIn Pittsâ€™s complaint, \r\n  there is no allegation of the first element of constructive fraud, a representation.Â  \r\n  Citing Ardis, Pitts argues there is no requirement for an affirmative statement \r\n  because constructive fraud can be based on omissions or silence where there \r\n  is a duty to speak. Â Although Ardis recognizes â€œ[n]ondisclosure is fraudulent \r\n  when there is a duty to speak,â€ this discussion relates to a claim for fraudulent \r\n  concealment, not constructive fraud.Â  Ardis, 314 S.C. at 517, 431 S.E.2d at \r\n  270. We find the first element requiring an affirmative representation has not \r\n  been met.Â  Because all elements must be met and pled, the constructive fraud \r\n  cause of action was properly dismissed.\r\nTo the extent the matter \r\n  was heard as a summary judgment motion, there was no evidence outside the complaint \r\n  of Pittsâ€™s reliance or his right to rely.Â  Therefore, granting the motion was \r\n  proper on this ground.Â  As previously discussed, there was no fiduciary relationship \r\n  created by the application for insurance.Â  Thus, Pitts had no right to rely.Â  \r\n  Moreover, the record provides no evidence of an affirmative representation by \r\n  Loring in connection with the Pittsesâ€™ policies.Â  Pitts knew of the existence \r\n  of two different policies because he obtained a preferred policy for himself \r\n  at the same time he obtained the non-preferred policy for his daughter.Â  Therefore, \r\n  he cannot claim Loring acted fraudulently by not informing him of these policies.Â  \r\n  He already had knowledge of both policies.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Fraudulent Concealment\r\nPitts asserts the circuit court \r\n  erred in granting Jackson Nationalâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to his fraudulent \r\n  concealment cause of action.Â  Pitts contends Jackson National was guilty of \r\n  fraudulent concealment because it failed to disclose information related to \r\n  the insurance policies. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œNondisclosure is fraudulent \r\n  when there is a duty to speak.â€Â  Ardis, 314 S.C. at 517, 431 S.E.2d at 270.Â  \r\n  â€œNon-disclosure becomes fraudulent concealment only when it is the duty of the \r\n  party having knowledge of the facts to make them known to the other party to \r\n  the transaction.â€Â  Lawson v. Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 259 S.C. \r\n  477, 481-82, 193 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1972).Â  Thus, the issue is whether Jackson \r\n  National had a duty to disclose facts which it did not disclose.Â  In Ardis, \r\n  this Court stated:\r\n\r\n  The duty to disclose may be reduced \r\n    to three distinct classes: (1) where it arises from a preexisting definite \r\n    fiduciary relation between the parties; (2) where one party expressly reposes \r\n    a trust and confidence in the other with reference to the particular transaction \r\n    in question, or else from the circumstances of the case, the nature of their \r\n    dealings, or their position towards each other, such a trust and confidence \r\n    in the particular case is necessarily implied; (3) where the very contract \r\n    or transaction itself, in its essential nature, is intrinsically fiduciary \r\n    and necessarily calls for perfect good faith and full disclosure without regard \r\n    to any particular intention of the parties.Â  \r\n\r\nArdis, 314 S.C. at \r\n  517, 431 S.E.2d at 270 (quoting Jacobson v. Yaschik, 249 S.C. 577, 585, 155 \r\n  S.E.2d 601, 605 (1967)).\r\nPitts acknowledged \r\n  during the motion hearing that the first class of Ardis, requiring a pre-existing, \r\n  definite fiduciary relationship to create a duty to disclose, does not exist \r\n  in this case.Â  The second class requires one party to expressly or impliedly \r\n  repose a trust and confidence in the other party.Â  Pitts did not expressly tell \r\n  Loring he was imposing a trust or confidence in him.Â  There is no evidence that \r\n  this trust and confidence impliedly existed between Pitts and Loring.Â  The parties \r\n  had no previous dealings.Â  We have already found they did not have a fiduciary \r\n  relationship.Â  Further, the relationship involved an armâ€™s length commercial \r\n  transaction between an applicant and his insurance agent.Â  As previously discussed, \r\n  our Supreme Court has held there is no relationship of trust and confidence \r\n  between an applicant and an insurance agent.Â  See Gordon v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. \r\n  Co. of N.Y.,Â  238 S.C. 438, 451, 120 S.E.2d 509, 515 (1961) (finding there was \r\n  no â€œrelation of trust and confidence between the [insured] and the agent of \r\n  the [insurance company]â€); see also Oâ€™Connor v. Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen, 217 S.C. \r\n  442, 448, 60 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1950) (holding â€œ[t]here was no relation of trust \r\n  and confidence between [the insured] and the soliciting agentâ€).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Jackson National owed no duty to advise Pitts concerning the policies.Â  Trotter \r\n  v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 465, 471, 377 S.E.2d 343, 347 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œGenerally, an insurer and its agents owe no duty to advise \r\n  an insured.â€).Â  Therefore, the second class of Ardis was not met.Â Â Â  \r\nThe third class of \r\n  Ardis requires the contract or transaction be â€œintrinsically fiduciary.â€ We \r\n  have already recognized that a claim of a fiduciary relationship â€œcannot rest \r\n  upon the mere relationship of insurer and insured.â€Â  Moses, 298 F. Supp. at \r\n  323.Â  Moreover, at the application stage, the insurer is only required to fulfill \r\n  a limited role as the Court explained in Moses:\r\n\r\nWhen requested, the [insurer] was obligated to be accurate \r\n  and fair in its advice and in the information it gave the [insured].Â  But this \r\n  did not mean the [insurer] was required to go beyond the request of the [insured] \r\n  for information, to inject matters not raised by the [insured], or to make independent \r\n  inquiries into such extraneous matters, especially when these matters were well \r\n  within the knowledge of the [insured] herself.Â  \r\n\r\nMoses, 298 F. Supp. at 324.\r\nIn his brief, Pitts \r\n  contends he â€œclearly presented evidence which demonstrated the existence of \r\n  genuine issues of material fact as to whether the circumstances of the case, \r\n  the nature of the dealings between [Pitts and Jackson National], or their position \r\n  towards one another implied a trust and confidence which would require a duty \r\n  to disclose.â€ Â Despite this statement, Pitts never specifically listed \r\n  the evidence but instead referenced other arguments.Â  In our view, there is \r\n  no evidence that would imply a trust and confidence requiring a duty on the \r\n  part of Jackson National to disclose the existence of preferred policies or \r\n  to perform â€œfull underwritingâ€ in order to inform every standard policy applicant \r\n  of any eligibility for a preferred policy.\r\nAdditionally, Pitts \r\n  received a preferred policy for himself and a non-preferred policy for his daughter. \r\n  These policies disclosed the information he claims Jackson National concealed.Â  \r\n  â€œ[O]ne cannot complain of fraud in the misrepresentation of the content of a \r\n  written instrument when the truth could have been ascertained by reading the \r\n  instrument . . . .â€Â  Giles v. Lanford &amp; Gibson, Inc., 285 S.C. 285, 289, \r\n  328 S.E.2d 916, 918 (Ct. App. 1985) (quoting Guy v. Natâ€™l Old Line Ins. Co., \r\n  252 S.C. 47, 51, 164 S.E.2d 905, 906 (1968)).Â  Giles recognizes the circumstances \r\n  of each case must be considered.Â  We find the circumstances of this case indicate \r\n  the nature of the transaction itself did not create any duty to disclose.Â  The \r\n  third and final class of Ardis has not been met.Â  Because we find no disclosure \r\n  requirement for Jackson National, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment for the claim of fraudulent concealment.\r\nIV.Â  Unjust Enrichment\r\nA.\r\nPitts contends the \r\n  circuit court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment on the unjust \r\n  enrichment claim.Â  He asserts Jackson National â€œwill be unjustly enriched if \r\n  it is allowed to retain [funds it received from Ultimate policy-holders who \r\n  qualified for the Preferred Ultimate policy] and, therefore, a constructive \r\n  trust should be imposed on all monies wrongfully obtained by Jackson National \r\n  through concealment and non-disclosure.â€Â  In support of his claim for unjust \r\n  enrichment, Pitts relies on the duty of good faith and fair dealing and the \r\n  anti-discrimination provision of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  38-55-50 (2002).\r\nGenerally, the denial \r\n  of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable.Â  Olson v. Faculty \r\n  House of Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 216, 544 S.E.2d 38, 49 (Ct. App. 2001), \r\n  cert. granted (Oct. 10, 2001).Â  However, we have recently recognized an exception \r\n  to this rule.Â  Id.Â  â€œSpecifically, the courts have made a practice of accepting \r\n  appeals of denials of interlocutory orders not ordinarily immediately appealable \r\n  when these appeals are companion to issues that are reviewable.â€Â  Id.; see Morris \r\n  v. Anderson County, 349 S.C. 607, 610, 564 S.E.2d 649, 651 (2002) (stating an \r\n  appellate court â€œmay, as a matter of discretion, consider an unappealable order \r\n  along with an appealable issue where such a ruling will avoid unnecessary litigationâ€).\r\nAlthough Pitts correctly characterizes \r\n  this issue as the denial of his motion for summary judgment, we believe the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision to grant summary judgment to Jackson National encompassed \r\n  the claim of unjust enrichment.Â  In its order, the court recognized Jackson \r\n  Nationalâ€™s argument that â€œthe absence of [a] legal duty would be equally fatal \r\n  to Plaintiffsâ€™ fraudulent concealment claim and to the unjust enrichment claim \r\n  . . . which was also premised on the existence of such a duty.â€Â  Moreover, \r\n  the court specifically held â€œthe duty of an insurer to inform an applicant of \r\n  the availability of an allegedly superior product, or to evaluate the applicantâ€™s \r\n  eligibility for that product, regardless of what product the applicant asked \r\n  for does not exist in South Carolina.Â  For this reason, Plaintiffsâ€™ unjust enrichment/constructive \r\n  trust claim fails also.â€ \r\nBecause the denial \r\n  of the motion for summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim is so closely \r\n  connected to these other issues and constitutes a basis for the grant of summary \r\n  judgment to Jackson National, we may properly review it at this time.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the parties have briefed the merits of the denial of the motion for summary \r\n  judgment, which further supports our decision to review the unjust enrichment \r\n  claim.Â  See Olson, 344 S.C. at 218, 544 S.E.2d at 51 (holding that â€œ[i]n essence, \r\n  the parties have consented to have the [denial of the summary judgment motion] \r\n  adjudicated by this tribunalâ€ because the parties briefed and argued the issue). \r\n  \r\nTurning to the merits \r\n  of this issue, we note our Supreme Court â€œhas recognized quantum meruit as an \r\n  equitable doctrine to allow recovery for unjust enrichment.â€Â  Columbia Wholesale \r\n  Co. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994). â€œAbsent \r\n  an express contract, recovery under quantum meruit is based on quasi-contract, \r\n  the elements of which are: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the \r\n  plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention \r\n  by the defendant of the benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him \r\n  to retain it without paying its value.â€Â  Id.Â Â  Our Supreme Court recently emphasized \r\n  and adopted this Scudder May test as the â€œsole test for a quantum meruit/quasi-contract/implied \r\n  by law claim.â€Â  Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, \r\n  9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).\r\nâ€œIn a law action, the \r\n  measure of damages is determined by the partiesâ€™ agreement, while in equity, \r\n  â€˜the measure of the recovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed \r\n  by law, and is expressed by the amount which the court considers the defendant \r\n  has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.â€™â€ Myrtle Beach Hosp., \r\n  Inc., 341 S.C. at 8, 532 S.E.2d at 872 (quoting United States Rubber Prods., \r\n  Inc. v.

West Am. \r\n  Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 102, 518 S.E.2d 608, 614 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[E]very contract \r\n  carries with it a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the processing \r\n  of a claim under a mutually binding insurance contract.â€).Â  \r\nThe trial judge found \r\n  â€œ[b]ecause the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not even come into \r\n  existence until a contract is entered, it would not apply to the sales transaction \r\n  that Plaintiffs complain of here.â€Â  Â Â Pitts was not a party to a contract \r\n  at the time of the challenged conduct of Jackson Nationalâ€™s agent.Â  Thus, there \r\n  can be no duty to disclose based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair \r\n  dealing.Â  See 14 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance Â§ 198:16, \r\n  at 198-29 (3d ed. 1999) (â€œ[T]he duty of good faith and fair dealing is considered \r\n  to be mutual duty of the insured and the insurer and generally applies to the \r\n  conduct of the parties in the context of the insurance contract.â€).Â  \r\nC.\r\nPitts also argues section \r\n  38-55-50 of the South Carolina Code â€œdemonstrates that Jackson Nationalâ€™s conduct \r\n  is wrongful and implies a duty to disclose.â€Â  He contends the statute \r\n  is relevant in determining whether Jackson Nationalâ€™s conduct was wrongful in \r\n  that it provides a â€œguidepost or standard in making that determination.â€\r\nSection 38-55-50 provides \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  An insurer, its agent, or an \r\n    insurance broker doing business in this State may not make or permit any discrimination \r\n    in favor of individuals between insureds of the same class and risk involving \r\n    the same hazards in the amount of the payment of premiums or rates charged \r\n    for policies of insurance . . . or in any other of the terms and conditions \r\n    of the contracts it makes.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-55-50 \r\n  (2002).Â  This statute, a legislative prohibition against insurance discrimination, \r\n  cannot be read as creating an implied duty to inform the applicant of all available \r\n  policies.Â  Furthermore, we find this statutory provision does not create a duty \r\n  to disclose which would allow a claim for unjust enrichment.Â  See Hodges v. \r\n  Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000) (stating a court must apply the plain \r\n  meaning of a statute where its language is unambiguous and conveys a clear meaning); \r\n  Charleston County Sch.

Haile, \r\n  of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Warren B. Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  John H. Simmons was convicted \r\n  of first degree burglary and petit larceny.Â  He was sentenced to life without \r\n  the possibility of parole.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 4, 1999, at approximately 2:15 a.m., Shirley \r\n  Ann Thompson was in bed when she heard her door beep.Â  Thompson had aÂ  burglar \r\n  alarm system in her home on Liberty Street, but she did not have the alarm activated \r\n  that evening.Â  Even without the alarm activated, the system would beep whenever \r\n  a door in Thompsonâ€™s home was opened.Â  Initially, Thompson assumed it was her \r\n  son, but she soon discovered the man she saw carrying a light in her hallway \r\n  was not her son.Â  Thompson watched the figure walk down the hallway and grab \r\n  her purse from the doorknob of her bedroom door, pulling the bedroom door closed \r\n  in the process.Â  Thompson grabbed her gun, chased the man out of her house, \r\n  and shot toward him as he was fleeing down Liberty Street in the direction of \r\n  the car wash.Â  Thompson then called the police to report the burglary (Thompson \r\n  burglary).Â  She described the man as a dark-skinned black male wearing a black \r\n  shirt with white writing on the back.\r\nOn that same morning, Douglas Brooks was watching television \r\n  at his home near the intersection of Liberty and Magrath Streets, which was \r\n  a block and a half away from Thompsonâ€™s home.Â  Sometime after 2:00 a.m., Brooks \r\n  heard a loud noise coming from his back door which sounded like someone was \r\n  trying to kick the door in.Â  Brooks investigated the noise and saw someone jump \r\n  off of his back porch.Â  Brooks chased the man until he ran across Colonial Drive.Â  \r\n  Brooks stopped pursuing the suspect, and turned around to see a patrol car responding \r\n  to the call at Thompsonâ€™s house.Â  Brooks flagged the officer down, informed \r\n  him of the incident at his home, and described the suspect as wearing dark clothing.\r\nAs Officer Robert Lee Gibson was driving to Thompsonâ€™s house in response to \r\n  her call to 911, he saw a man in dark clothing run across Colonial Drive as \r\n  he approached Liberty Street.Â  Gibson informed another officer that he saw the \r\n  suspect running down Colonial Drive.Â  Police circled the area to find the suspect.Â  \r\n  Minutes later, the police located Simmons, who was hiding in some nearby bushes.Â  \r\n  He was wearing a black t-shirt with white writing on it.Â  In the bushes, police \r\n  found some clothing and other items Brooks had stored in his outside shed.Â  \r\n  Simmons had abrasions on his head.Â  An ambulance was called to examine Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  wounds.\r\nThompson was taken to the scene, where she identified Simmons as the figure \r\n  she had seen in her home.Â  Although Thompsonâ€™s purse was not immediately located, \r\n  it was discovered the next morning across the street from the car wash near \r\n  a daycare center.Â  Because Brooks only viewed the suspect from the rear, he \r\n  was unable to identify Simmons as the man who ran from his back porch. \r\nEdward Anderson, a co-worker of Simmons, testified at \r\n  trial.Â  He stated that he and Simmons were working at the Cotton Club the evening \r\n  of October 3, 1999.Â  That night, Simmons was wearing the clubâ€™s uniform, a black \r\n  t-shirt with â€œCotton Clubâ€ written on the back in white writing, along with \r\n  black pants and suspenders.Â  Anderson declared that he and Simmons left the \r\n  club when it closed at midnight on October 4, 1999.Â  The two men went to Daveâ€™s \r\n  Lounge, where they drank several alcoholic beverages.Â  On previous occasions, \r\n  Anderson had driven Simmons home after work.Â  Their route took them down Beltline \r\n  Boulevard.Â  After the two left Daveâ€™s around 2:00 a.m., an intoxicated Simmons \r\n  directed Anderson to vary from their usual route by letting him out of the car \r\n  near Beltline Boulevard and Colonial Drive, without explanation.Â  Anderson let \r\n  Simmons out of the car on Colonial Drive.Â  Anderson then continued home.\r\nPeter Banco, an officer with the Columbia police department, \r\n  responded to Thompsonâ€™s house on the morning of the burglary.Â  He took a statement \r\n  from Thompson at 4:05 a.m.Â  He later returned to his office where he was able \r\n  to speak with Simmons, who was already in custody.Â  Banco gave Simmons his Miranda \r\n  warnings.Â  Simmons indicated he understood his rights.Â  Simmons smelled of alcohol \r\n  but he did not appear drunk to Banco.Â  When Banco asked Simmons whether he could \r\n  have attempted to break into Thompsonâ€™s and Brooksâ€™ homes, Simmons replied that \r\n  he did not â€œknow whatâ€™s going on.â€Â  The interview ended.\r\nSimmons testified in his own defense at trial.Â  He stated \r\n  that the evening of the incident, he was wearing his black Cotton Club shirt \r\n  with black tuxedo pants.Â  He started drinking alcoholic beverages at about 4:00 \r\n  p.m. while he was preparing dinner at home.Â  Simmons had a few more drinks at \r\n  the Cotton Club.Â  He and Anderson left the Cotton Club at midnight and went \r\n  to Daveâ€™s Lounge, where he imbibed three or four alcoholic drinks. According \r\n  to Simmons, when he and Anderson left Daveâ€™s Lounge sometime between 1:00 and \r\n  2:00 a.m., Simmons was not intoxicated.Â  Simmons claimed he asked Anderson to \r\n  stop the car because he began to feel nauseous from all the alcohol he drank \r\n  that day and he wanted to get out and walk.Â  Simmons declared that he put on \r\n  his earphones to his radio and began to walk along the edge of the road, when \r\n  he thought he heard someone come up behind him.Â  Simmons stated that, when he \r\n  turned around to see a police patrol car behind him, he was struck by the patrol \r\n  car.Â  Simmons said he blacked out at that point, and his next memory was of \r\n  waking up when medical personnel were working on him.Â  Simmons denied breaking \r\n  into Thompsonâ€™s residence or attempting to break into Brooksâ€™ home.Â  He further \r\n  denied being in the bushes that morning.Â  Simmons maintained the abrasion on \r\n  his face that morning was the result of being hit by the patrol car.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Did the Circuit Court err in denying Simmonsâ€™ motion to sever?\r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Did the Circuit Court err in denying Simmonsâ€™ motion for a mistrial after \r\n    directed verdicts of acquittal were issued on the burglary and petit larceny \r\n    charges from the Brooks burglary?\r\n    III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    Did the Circuit Court err in allowing the use of Simmonsâ€™ prior burglary and \r\n    housebreaking convictions to prove an element of first degree burglary?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â \r\nSEVERANCE/JOINDER\r\nSimmons argues the trial judge erred in failing to sever the two \r\n  burglary charges against him for trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior to trial, Simmons moved to sever the charges against him.Â  \r\n  Simmons contended the victims in the Thompson and Brooks burglaries were different, \r\n  the witnesses were different, and the acts alleged were different. Simmons asserted \r\n  he would be prejudiced if the jury heard about both the Thompson and the Brooks \r\n  burglaries because the evidence was stronger in the Thompson matter and would \r\n  influence the jury on the Brooks matter.Â  The trial judge noted that the matter \r\n  was within his discretion, and the trial proceeded on both sets of charges.\r\nA motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  \r\n  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); McCrary v. State, \r\n  249 S.C. 14, 152 S.E.2d 235 (1967); State v. Carter, 324 S.C. 383, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 1996); State v. Anderson, 318 S.C. 395, 458 S.E.2d \r\n  56 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of that discretion.Â  Tucker, 324 S.C. at 164, 478 S.E.2d at \r\n  265; State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 447 S.E.2d 177 (1993); State v. \r\n  Deal, 319 S.C. 49, 459 S.E.2d 93 (Ct. App. 1995); see also State \r\n  v. Harris, Op. No. 25535 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 14, 2002) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 34 at 32) (stating a motion for severance is addressed to trial \r\n  court and should not be disturbed unless abuse of discretion is shown).\r\nWhere the offenses charged in separate indictments are of \r\n  the same general nature involving connected transactions closely related in \r\n  kind, place and character, the trial judge has the power, in his discretion, \r\n  to order the indictments tried together if the defendantâ€™s substantive rights \r\n  would not be prejudiced. Â State v. Smith, 322 S.C. 107, 470 S.E.2d 364 \r\n  (1996); State v. Williams, 263 S.C. 290, 210 S.E.2d 298 (1974); State \r\n  v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1996); see also \r\n  State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (where offenses \r\n  charged in separate indictments are of same general nature, involving connected \r\n  transactions closely related in kind, place and character, trial judge has authority, \r\n  in his discretion, to order indictments tried together over objection of defendant \r\n  absent showing that defendantâ€™s substantive rights were violated); McCrary \r\n  v. State, 249 S.C. 14, 36, 152 S.E.2d 235, 246 (1967) (stating â€œ[t]he two \r\n  offenses were of the same general nature, involving connected transactions closely \r\n  related in time, place and character; and the trial judge had power, in his \r\n  discretion, to order them tried together over objection by the defendant in \r\n  the absence of a showing that the latterâ€™s substantive rights would have been \r\n  thereby prejudiced.â€).Â  Offenses are considered to be of the same general nature \r\n  where they are interconnected.Â  Jones, 325 S.C. at 315, 479 S.E.2d at \r\n  519.\r\nConversely, offenses which are of the same nature, but which \r\n  do not arise out of a single chain of circumstances and are not provable by \r\n  the same evidence may not properly be tried together.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 339 S.E.2d 692 (1986) (holding although \r\n  prison escapee committed two murders within a few miles of each other and attempted \r\n  an armed robbery, the trial judge erred in consolidating the charges for one \r\n  trial where the crimes did not arise out of a single chain of circumstances \r\n  and they required different evidence); State v. Tate, 286 S.C. 462, 334 \r\n  S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding that joint trial on identical but unrelated \r\n  forgeries violated defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial).Â  Cf. State \r\n  v. Woomer, 276 S.C. 258, 277 S.E.2d 696 (1981) (proper to try together all \r\n  crimes arising from a single uninterrupted crime spree).\r\nFurther, joinder of offenses in one trial is â€œproper if the offenses (1) are \r\n  of the same general nature or character and spring from the same series of transactions, \r\n  (2) are committed by the same offender, and (3) require the same or similar \r\n  proof.â€Â  State v. Carter, 324 S.C. 383, 386, 478 S.E.2d 86, 88 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996) (citing City of Greenville v. Chapman, 210 S.C. 157, 41 S.E.2d \r\n  865 (1947)); see also State v. Harris, Op. No. 25535 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 14, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 34 at 32) (â€œCharges can \r\n  be joined in the same indictment and tried together where they (1) arise out \r\n  of a single chain of circumstances, (2) are proved by the same evidence, (3) \r\n  are of the same general nature, and (4) no real right of the defendant has been \r\n  prejudiced.â€).\r\nIn the instant case, the joinder of the separate burglary offenses \r\n  was proper.Â  The break-in at Thompsonâ€™s house was very close in time and proximity \r\n  to the attempted break-in at Brooksâ€™ home.Â  Although Brooks could not identify \r\n  the physical characteristics of the man who attempted to break into his home, \r\n  both Brooks and Thompson similarly described the suspect as wearing dark clothing.Â  \r\n  Simmons was found after Brooks chased him and directed police to Simmonsâ€™ location.Â  \r\n  Despite the fact that Simmons was granted a directed verdict in the Brooks matter, \r\n  both the indictments in the Brooks matter and the Thompson matter arose out \r\n  of a single chain of events, were of the same nature, and were proved by the \r\n  same evidence and witnesses.Â  We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in refusing to sever the indictments.\r\nII.Â  RES GESTAE\r\nFurthermore, the evidence of the Brooks burglary was necessary for a full presentation \r\n  of the case without fragmentation.Â  In State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, \r\n  470 S.E.2d 366 (1996), our Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nOne of the accepted bases for the admissibility of evidence \r\n  of other crimes arises when such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of \r\n  the crimeâ€ or is necessary to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately \r\n  connected with and explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and \r\n  is so much a part of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its \r\n  proof is appropriate in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by \r\n  proving its immediate context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense \r\n  is â€˜so linked together in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged \r\n  that one cannot be fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] \r\n  part of the res gestae of the crime charged.â€Â Â  And where evidence is admissible \r\n  to provide this â€œfull presentationâ€ of the offense, â€œ[t]here is no reason to \r\n  fragmentize the event under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting United States v. Masters, \r\n  622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980)).\r\nSimmonsâ€™ act of burglarizing Thompsonâ€™s home was â€œinextricably intertwinedâ€ \r\n  with his attempt to evade Brooks, and his subsequent capture by the police.Â  \r\n  Adams, 322 S.C. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 371.Â  The information regarding \r\n  the Brooks burglary was relevant to show the complete, whole, unfragmented story \r\n  regarding Simmonsâ€™ crimes and capture.\r\nIII.Â  MISTRIAL/CURATIVE \r\n  INSTRUCTION\r\nSimmons maintains the trial court erred in denying his motion for \r\n  a mistrial.Â  He claims he was prejudiced by the presentation of evidence regarding \r\n  the Brooks burglary, especially in light of the fact that the trial court granted \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict on the Brooks matter.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the end of the Stateâ€™s case, Simmons moved for \r\n  a directed verdict of acquittal on the charges concerning the Brooks burglary.Â  \r\n  Simmons argued there was no evidence Brooksâ€™ home was entered, and the indictment \r\n  failed to allege that the shed outside Brooksâ€™ home was a building appurtenant \r\n  in order to qualify for burglary.Â  The trial court granted the directed verdict \r\n  as to the Brooks burglary and petit larceny charges, finding there was a lack \r\n  of evidence to support the charges.Â  Simmons then requested a mistrial, contending \r\n  the jury had heard the evidence regarding the Brooks burglary, the evidence \r\n  should not have been admitted under State v. Lyle \r\n  [1]  because there was not clear and convincing proof of the Brooks burglary, \r\n  and it had tainted the jury.Â  The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, \r\n  finding the Brooks burglary constituted a â€œcontinuous eventâ€ and the State was \r\n  entitled to present the Brooks evidence in order to show how Simmons was apprehended.\r\nSimmons requested â€œa curative instruction or some other instruction to the \r\n  jury as far as what they can consider or not consider as far as the second burglary.â€Â  \r\n  The trial court instructed the jury as follows:\r\nI need to advise you at this time that the court has granted \r\n  a motion for the defendant for a directed verdict and I have dismissed indictments \r\n  2000-GS-40-45786 and 787 which were the charges of burglary at [Brooksâ€™ address] \r\n  and the petty larceny that accompanied that charge.Â  So, I have granted a directed \r\n  verdict in favor of the defendant on those charges.Â  They are not to be considered \r\n  by the jury for any purpose for the remainder of this trial.Â  Weâ€™ll continue \r\n  with the trial at this time.Â Â  \r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial judge.Â  State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999);Â  \r\n  State v. Crosby, 348 S.C. 387, 559 S.E.2d 352 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. \r\n  granted (Aug. 7, 2002); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  845 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The courtâ€™s decision will not be overturned on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Harris, \r\n  340 S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 \r\n  S.E.2d 63 (1998); State v. Arnold, 266 S.C. 153, 157, 221 S.E.2d 867, \r\n  868 (1976) (the general rule of this State is that â€œthe ordering of, or refusal \r\n  of a motion for mistrial is within the discretion of the trial judge and such \r\n  discretion will not be overturned in the absence of abuse thereof amounting \r\n  to an error of law.â€).\r\nâ€œThe power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest \r\n  caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causesâ€ stated \r\n  into the record by the trial judge.Â  State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 28, \r\n  236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977); see also State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. \r\n  302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999) (granting of motion for mistrial is extreme measure \r\n  which should be taken only where incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect \r\n  can be removed in no other way); Patterson, 337 S.C. at 227, 522 S.E.2d \r\n  at 851 (mistrial should only be granted in cases of manifest necessity and with \r\n  the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons).Â  A mistrial should \r\n  only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant must show both \r\n  error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  Harris, \r\n  340 S.C. at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 628; see also State v. Council, \r\n  335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (mistrial should not be granted unless absolutely \r\n  necessary; to receive mistrial, defendant must show error and resulting prejudice).Â  \r\n  â€œThe less than lucid test is therefore declared to be whether the mistrial was \r\n  dictated by manifest necessity or the ends of public justice.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1983).\r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  motion for a mistrial.Â  The evidence presented regarding the Brooks burglary \r\n  showed that Brooks heard a noise, chased a suspect, and directed police to the \r\n  location where Simmons was apprehended.Â  This evidence was relevant to Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  capture and would have been admissible at trial regardless of whether Simmons \r\n  faced charges for the Brooks incident.Â  Thus, Simmons suffered no error or resulting \r\n  prejudice from the admission of this evidence.\r\nMoreover, the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the evidence \r\n  regarding the Brooks burglary.Â  Generally, a trial judgeâ€™s curative instruction \r\n  is deemed to cure any error.Â  See Kelsey, 331 S.C. at 75, 502 \r\n  S.E.2d at 76; Patterson, 337 S.C. at 226, 522 S.E.2d at 850; State \r\n  v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The trial judge \r\n  in the present action thoroughly instructed the jury that Simmons no longer \r\n  faced burglary or petit larceny charges in connection with the Brooks burglary \r\n  and they were not to consider that evidence in any way.Â  Concomitantly, we find \r\n  any alleged error in failing to declare a mistrial was cured.\r\nIV.Â  PRIOR BURGLARY/HOUSEBREAKING \r\n  CONVICTIONS\r\nSimmons argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to present \r\n  evidence of his prior burglary/housebreaking convictions as an element to support \r\n  first degree burglary.Â  Because Simmons agreed to stipulate that the burglary \r\n  occurred at night, he contends it was unnecessary for the State to additionally \r\n  prove his prior convictions.Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior to trial, Simmons moved to exclude evidence of his prior burglary/housebreaking \r\n  convictions because the charged burglaries in the case sub judice \r\n  occurred at night.Â  Therefore, the State could prove the â€œnighttimeâ€ element \r\n  of first degree burglary instead of proving the â€œtwo or more prior convictionsâ€ \r\n  element.Â  Simmons asserted the prior housebreaking convictions were more than \r\n  ten years old, thus outside the ten year time limit, and were prejudicial.Â  \r\n  The State informed the trial court that Simmonsâ€™ prior record included a 1981 \r\n  guilty plea to three counts of housebreaking; a 1983 conviction for common law \r\n  burglary, on which he later received post-conviction relief; and a 1998 guilty \r\n  plea to first degree burglary. \r\nSimmons offered to stipulate to the â€œnighttimeâ€ element.Â  After reviewing State \r\n  v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000), the trial court denied Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  motion.Â  The trial court limited the State to proving the prior record and ordered \r\n  it not to go into the details. \r\nAt the end of the Stateâ€™s case, Simmons and the State agreed to stipulate that \r\n  the jury could be told Simmons had â€œtwo or more prior convictions for either \r\n  burglary or housebreaking.â€Â  The stipulation was subject to Simmonsâ€™ objections.Â  \r\n  The trial court read the stipulation to the jury:\r\n\r\nThe State and the defense have entered into a stipulation \r\n  that the defendant in this case has two or more prior convictions for either \r\n  burglary or housebreaking.Â  These convictions are as follows: 1981, three counts \r\n  of housebreaking and in 1998 one count of burglary.Â  Now, I will further instruct \r\n  you that you are not to consider the prior convictions about which I have just \r\n  mentioned through the stipulation, you are not to consider these prior convictions \r\n  as evidence that the defendant committed the crimes for which he is currently \r\n  on trial nor should you consider the convictions as character evidence; that \r\n  is, you should not conclude that because the defendant has been convicted of \r\n  burglary and housebreaking previously that he is likely to have committed these \r\n  offenses for which he is currently charged.Â  You are to consider these prior \r\n  convictions simply as part of the elements that the State must prove in order \r\n  to make out a charge of first degree burglary.Â  And Iâ€™ll tell you the law on \r\n  first degree burglary at the conclusion of the case when I am instructing you \r\n  in the law.\r\n\r\nAfter the jury instruction, Simmons renewed his motions.\r\n First degree burglary is defined, in part, as \r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  (A) A person is guilty \r\n    of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent \r\n    and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and either:\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp; . . . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more \r\n  convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of both; or\r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) the entering . . . occurs in the nighttime.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. 2001).\r\nThe State is required to prove all the elements \r\n  of first degree burglary beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Benton, \r\n  338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000).Â  â€œ[B]ecause two prior burglary and/or housebreaking \r\n  convictions are an element of first degree burglary under Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2), \r\n  the defendant cannot require the State to stipulate to the prior convictions \r\n  in lieu of informing the jury about the prior convictions.â€Â  Id. at 155, \r\n  526 S.E.2d at 230; see also State v. James, 346 S.C. 303, 307, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 591, 592 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. granted (Nov. 15, 2001) (the \r\n  State cannot be forced to â€œstipulate generally to the prior offenses or to the \r\n  fact that the defendant had the legal status to be charged with first degree \r\n  burglary because such a stipulation might cause a substantial gap in the evidence \r\n  needed for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the offense.â€); State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 327 S.C. 440, 443, 486 S.E.2d 512, 513 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding \r\n  â€œthe two prior convictions were an element of the crime for which Appellant \r\n  was charged.Â  As such, the State was required to prove the two prior convictions \r\n  and could not be forced to accept Appellantâ€™s offered stipulation.â€).\r\nHowever, to ensure that the defendant is not convicted \r\n  on an improper basis while allowing the State to prove the elements of first \r\n  degree burglary, the trial court should limit the evidence to the prior burglary \r\n  and/or housebreaking convictions.Â  Benton, 338 S.C. at 156, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 230-31.Â  Detailed, particular information about the prior burglaries and/or \r\n  housebreaking convictions should not be admitted.Â  Id.Â  In addition, \r\n  the trial court should, on request, instruct the jury that the information should \r\n  only be considered for the limited purpose of proving one of the elements of \r\n  first degree burglary.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court recently considered an identical argument in State \r\n  v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 561 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In Cheatham, \r\n  the defense offered to stipulate that the burglary occurred in the nighttime \r\n  and moved in limine to prohibit the State from introducing the defendantâ€™s three \r\n  prior burglary convictions.Â  The trial court denied Cheathamâ€™s motion and allowed \r\n  the State to introduce evidence of both the â€œnighttimeâ€ and the â€œprior record \r\n  of two or more convictions for burglaryâ€ elements of first degree burglary.Â  \r\n  The Court articulated:\r\n\r\nIt is well settled the admission of prior burglary or housebreaking \r\n  convictions for limited consideration as an element of first degree burglary \r\n  does not constitute undue prejudice.Â  Thus, the admission of Cheathamâ€™s prior \r\n  burglary and housebreaking convictions as an element of first degree burglary \r\n  does not constitute unfair prejudice in this case.Â  Further, the trial judge \r\n  specifically instructed the jury not to consider Cheathamâ€™s prior convictions \r\n  as evidence of the Patel burglary and to limit their consideration of the prior \r\n  convictions to whether an element of first degree burglary was proven.Â  We find \r\n  no error in the admission of the convictions because the trial court took every \r\n  precaution to prevent the improper consideration of Cheatham's convictions and \r\n  to guard against undue prejudice.\r\nMoreover, we find no merit to Cheathamâ€™s assertion that because he was willing \r\n  to stipulate to the â€œnighttimeâ€ element of first degree burglary, the State \r\n  should have been limited to proving only the â€œnighttimeâ€ element and it was \r\n  unnecessary for the State to present any evidence of the â€œtwo or more convictions \r\n  of burglary or housebreakingâ€ element.Â  As previously discussed, the State is \r\n  not required to accept a defendantâ€™s stipulation of proof because the State \r\n  still bears the burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.Â  Despite Cheathamâ€™s attempt to stipulate that he met the legal status \r\n  to be charged with first degree burglary, we believe the trial court did not \r\n  err in denying his request to limit the State to proof of only the â€œnighttimeâ€ \r\n  element.\r\n\r\nCheatham, 349 S.C. at 109-110, 561 S.E.2d at 623 (internal citation \r\n  omitted).\r\nAs in Cheatham, Simmons maintains the State should have been \r\n  prohibited from submitting evidence of his prior burglary/housebreaking convictions \r\n  because evidence existed that the present burglary occurred at night.Â  The trial \r\n  court did not err in allowing the State to introduce evidence of Simmonsâ€™ prior \r\n  burglary/housebreaking convictions because proof of such prior convictions constitutes \r\n  an element of first degree burglary.Â  Because the State bears the burden of \r\n  proof, it was not required to prove only the â€œnighttimeâ€ element of first degree \r\n  burglary.Â  Further, Simmons agreed to stipulate to the convictions and their \r\n  admission.\r\nSimmons claims his prior housebreaking convictions should not have \r\n  been admitted because they were more than ten years old.Â  Whether a conviction \r\n  should be admitted at trial due to its age is a question most often seen in \r\n  evaluations of impeachment evidence under Rule 609, SCRE.Â  In this instance, \r\n  a record of a prior conviction is an element of the statutory crime.Â  \r\n  There is no requirement in the statute that the prior conviction be of a certain \r\n  age in order to allow admission.Â  There is no merit to Simmonsâ€™ argument.\r\nThe trial court properly limited the introduction of Simmonsâ€™ prior \r\n  burglary/housebreaking convictions to listing the conviction.Â  The jury was \r\n  not informed of the specific details of the crimes or convictions.Â  Finally, \r\n  the jury was instructed that they should consider the convictions only as proof \r\n  of an element of first degree burglary and that they were not to consider the \r\n  convictions as proof that Simmons was guilty of the current crime.Â  We find \r\n  no error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that where the offenses charged in separate indictments are of the \r\n  same general nature, involving connected transactions, closely related in kind, \r\n  place and character, the trial judge has discretion to order the indictments \r\n  tried together, over the objection of a defendant, absent a showing that the \r\n  defendantâ€™s substantive rights were violated.\r\nThe joinder of offenses in one trial is proper if the offenses (1) \r\n  are of the same general nature or character and spring from the same series \r\n  of transactions; (2) are committed by the same offender; and (3) require the \r\n  same or similar proof.\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever the two burglary \r\n  charges against Simmons.Â  Both indictments arose out of a single chain of events, \r\n  were of the same nature, and were proved by the same evidence and witnesses.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, evidence of the Brooks burglary was necessary for full presentation \r\n  of the case without fragmentation.Â  The trial judge did not err in denying Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  motion for a mistrial.Â  Moreover, the judgeâ€™s curative instruction to disregard \r\n  the evidence as to the Brooks burglary cured any alleged error in failing to \r\n  declare a mistrial.Â  Finally, the trial court properly allowed the State to \r\n  present evidence of Simmonsâ€™ prior burglary/housebreaking convictions as an \r\n  element to support first degree burglary.Â  Accordingly, Simmonsâ€™ convictions \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Randolph \r\n          Haldi, both of Pawleys Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Â The \r\n  central issue in this case is whether the estate of a surviving spouse who had \r\n  filed her elective share claim may receive that share when the surviving spouse \r\n  dies before the determination of her elective share.Â  We hold that the estate \r\n  is entitled to the share.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married in April of 1993.Â  Husband \r\n  died testate on January 5, 1998, survived by Wife and a son, Robert Evert, from \r\n  a previous marriage.Â  Husbandâ€™s will dated June 26, 1990, which was admitted \r\n  to probate on February 23, 1998, named his son as personal representative and \r\n  sole heir.Â  On May 1, 1998, Wife filed an Election by Surviving Spouse to take \r\n  an elective share of Husbandâ€™s estate.Â  Wife died on May 18, 1999, and her son \r\n  from a previous marriage, Gregg Gallagher, was appointed personal representative \r\n  of her estate.Â  Gallagher brought this action in probate court in his capacity \r\n  as personal representative of her estate to recover Wifeâ€™s elective share.  [1] The probate court denied the elective \r\n  share to Wifeâ€™s estate, holding that the elective share was intended to provide \r\n  for the surviving spouse during the remainder of her lifetime â€œso as to prevent \r\n  the surviving spouse from becoming a ward of the state.â€Â  It further found that \r\n  the elective share â€œwas not intended to be employed so as to augment an estate \r\n  for the benefit of heirs.â€Â  Finally, the probate court held that any claim for \r\n  an elective share was fully satisfied by non-probate assets.Â  However, the probate \r\n  court ordered Husbandâ€™s estate to pay Wifeâ€™s estate $8,000 as reimbursement \r\n  for a previous estate debt paid by Wife and also ordered Husbandâ€™s estate to \r\n  pay attorneyâ€™s fees to Wifeâ€™s estate.Â  Both parties appealed to the circuit \r\n  court.Â  \r\nOn May 26, 2000, the circuit court issued an order \r\n  affirming the probate courtâ€™s denial of the elective share, reversing the probate \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wifeâ€™s estate, and reversing the probate \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to reimburse Wifeâ€™s estate with $8,000.Â  While the circuit \r\n  court found the probate court erred in concluding the right to an elective share \r\n  does not survive the death of a surviving spouse, it affirmed the denial of \r\n  the elective share finding â€œit would be absurd to hold that the heirs of Mrs. \r\n  Evertâ€™sÂ  estate should be entitled to the benefits of an elective share simply \r\n  because the surviving spouse made the election during her lifetime.â€Â  The circuit \r\n  court found the result unjust, as well as absurd, and placed particular significance \r\n  on the fact that Wife received over $219,000 in non-probate assets.Â  \r\nGallagher served a motion to alter or amend the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The circuit court denied \r\n  the motion and Gallagher now appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Wifeâ€™s \r\n  estate was not entitled to her elective share of Husbandâ€™s estate, that it was \r\n  not entitled to an $8,000 loan repayment from Husbandâ€™s estate, and that it \r\n  was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Timeliness of Gallagherâ€™s appeal to Circuit Court\r\nAs an initial matter, \r\n  we address Evertâ€™s argument that Gallagher failed to timely appeal the decision \r\n  of the circuit court by failing to provide the circuit court proper notice of \r\n  his motion to alter or amend judgment as required by Rule 59(g), SCRCP.Â  Evert \r\n  contends that because a copy of the Rule 59(e) motion was not provided to the \r\n  circuit court within ten days of the filing of the motion, the time for appeal \r\n  was not stayed, and thus this appeal is untimely under Rule 203, SCACR.Â  We \r\n  disagree. [2] Â  \r\nAlthough the circuit court acknowledged that it \r\n  never received a copy of the motion until December 12, 2000, and â€œon this ground \r\n  aloneâ€ it could deny the motion, the circuit court went forward and considered \r\n  the matters presented in Gallagherâ€™s memorandum in support of the motion.Â  Because \r\n  the circuit court found it appropriate to hear the matter, we find no error \r\n  in the circuit courtâ€™s decision to decide the motion despite Gallagherâ€™s failure \r\n  to comply with Rule 59(g), SCRCP.Â  The notes to Rule 59, SCRCP, indicate that \r\n  subsection (g) was added â€œto help insure the judge is promptly notified that \r\n  the motion has been filed.â€Â  There is no indication that the failure to transmit \r\n  a copy of the motion to the circuit court affects the tolling provision of Rule \r\n  203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  Therefore, the time for filing the notice of appeal did not \r\n  begin to run until after the circuit court denied the motion on December 27, \r\n  2000.Â  After the circuit court denied the motion, only twenty days passed before \r\n  Gallagher filed his notice of appeal on January 16, 2001, thus Gallagher complied \r\n  with Rule 203(b), SCACR. \r\nII.Â  Elective Share\r\nGallagher \r\n  argues the circuit court erred in refusing to allow Wifeâ€™s estate to recover \r\n  her elective share of Husbandâ€™s estate.Â  We agree.\r\nThe issue of whether the heirs \r\n  of a surviving spouse are entitled to the surviving spouseâ€™s elective share \r\n  where the spouse applies for the share, but dies prior to its determination, \r\n  is an issue of first impression in this state.Â  We begin our analysis by considering \r\n  the language of the statute governing the elective share.Â  Section 62-2-201 \r\n  provides that â€œif a married person domiciled in this State dies, the surviving \r\n  spouse has a right of election to take an elective share of one-third of the \r\n  decedent's probate estate.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-201(a) (Supp. 2001).Â  Additionally, \r\n  Section 62-2-203 provides that â€œthe right of election of the surviving spouse \r\n  may be exercised only during his lifetime by him or by his duly appointed attorney \r\n  in fact.â€ [3] Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-203 (Supp. 2001).Â  \r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n  and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of \r\n  Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  \r\n  â€œUnless there is something in a statute requiring a different interpretation, \r\n  the words used in the statute must be given their ordinary meaning.â€Â  Mullinax \r\n  v. J.M. Brown Amusement, Co., 326 S.C. 453, 458, 485 S.E.2d 103, 106 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and \r\n  fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  \r\n  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, \r\n  and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or \r\n  impose another meaning.Â  Miller v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 447, 441 S.E.2d \r\n  319, 321 (1994).Â  â€œOn the other hand, where a statute is ambiguous, the Court \r\n  must construe the terms of the statute.â€Â  Lester v. South Carolina Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Commâ€™n, 334 S.C. 557, 561, 514 S.E.2d 751, 752-53 (1999).\r\nWhen confronted \r\n  with this question, other jurisdictions with similar elective share statutes \r\n  have determined that when a surviving spouse has validly exercised her right \r\n  to the elective share, her personal representative may file a petition for the \r\n  elective share determination for the benefit of the surviving spouseâ€™s estate. \r\n  In Smail v. Hutchins, 491 So.2d 301, 302 (Fla. App. 1986), the court \r\n  found that â€œthe right to share in the decedentâ€™s estate is not lost if the surviving \r\n  spouse dies after the election but before the court determines the amount of \r\n  the elective share.â€Â  The Florida court rejected the argument that the heirs \r\n  and not the surviving spouse would benefit: \r\n\r\nWhile this argument has been recognized to prevent a personal \r\n  representative from exercising a deceased â€œsurvivingâ€ spouseâ€™s election, the \r\n  reasoning is unavailing here. That heirs of a surviving spouse may benefit from \r\n  an election is not determinative. What is determinative is whether the surviving \r\n  spouse validly exercised the election. Merely because a surviving spouseâ€™s \r\n  heirs may benefit from an election is no reason to deny the surviving spouseâ€™s \r\n  statutory right to choose the elective share. If a surviving spouse dies shortly \r\n  after receiving the elective share the heirs will most certainly be the primary \r\n  beneficiaries of the election. \r\n\r\nId. at 303 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\r\nPennsylvania addressed \r\n  a similar situation in Trezak v. Jierski, 661 A.2d 412 (Pa. Super. Ct. \r\n  1995), and determined that a surviving spouseâ€™s heirs could pursue her elected \r\n  but undetermined share.Â  The Pennsylvania Superior Court found â€œthere was no \r\n  reason in law or equity why the claims of a surviving spouse, now deceased, \r\n  being pursued by her heirs, should be weakened by death.â€Â  Id. at 413.Â  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Nebraska Supreme Court has held that \r\n  once a surviving spouse petitions for her elective share that right becomes \r\n  vested.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a surviving spouse has petitioned for an elective share, \r\n  the right to pursue an elective share is no longer a surviving spouseâ€™s potential \r\n  personal right subject to abatement, but has become a right vested in \r\n  the surviving spouse. Therefore, if a surviving spouse dies after filing a petition \r\n  for an elective share . . . , the proceeding to enforce the spouseâ€™s election \r\n  as a vested right may be revived by the personal representative of the estate \r\n  of the spouse who has made the election but who has died before distribution \r\n  of property pursuant to the elective share.\r\n\r\nÂ In \r\n  re Estate of Stephenson, 503 N.W.2d 540, 545 (Neb. 1993).Â  \r\nSignificantly, Pennsylvania, \r\n  Florida, and Nebraskaâ€™s elective share statutes are similar to our elective \r\n  share statute in that the right of election may be exercised only during the \r\n  lifetime of the surviving spouse.Â  Furthermore, none of these statesâ€™ statutes \r\n  indicates an intent to provide for the needs of the surviving spouse only during \r\n  her lifetime. [4]  See \r\n  Fla. Stat. Ann. Â§Â§ 732.201, 732.2125 (Supp. 2001); Neb. Rev. State. Â§30-2137 \r\n  (Supp. 2001); Pa. Stat. Ann. Â§Â§2206, 2203 (Supp. 2001).\r\nWhen the elective share statute was enacted in 1987, \r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s common law did not require a spouse to devise any of her property \r\n  to a surviving spouse.Â  Thus, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-205 â€œis a statute of creation, \r\n  and strict compliance with its terms is mandatory in order to exercise the right \r\n  to an elective share.â€Â  Simpson v. Sanders, 314 S.C. 413, 415, 445 S.E.2d \r\n  93, 94 (1994).Â  We decline to construe the elective share statute to imply anything \r\n  other than the plain language it employs.Â  Our statute provides that the â€œelectionâ€ \r\n  of the share must be made during the surviving spouseâ€™s lifetime; thus, once \r\n  the spouse survives his or her spouseâ€™s death and makes the election, that requirement \r\n  is met.Â \r\nMoreover, we are inclined to agree with those jurisdictions \r\n  which hold that once a valid election is made, that right becomes vested in \r\n  the surviving spouse and would pass to her estate at her death.Â  In the absence \r\n  of any language in the statute to the contrary, we find that the type of interest \r\n  embraced by the elective share is a fee simple estate.Â  We find no support in \r\n  the statute or the case law for characterization of the elective share as a \r\n  life estate.Â  Accordingly, we hold a surviving spouseâ€™s estate may recover the \r\n  elective share when the surviving spouse dies after making the election but \r\n  before the probate court determines the share.Â \r\n&nbsp; \r\n  Because Wifeâ€™s estate was entitled to recover her elective share, we find the \r\n  circuit court erred in denying recovery of the share.Â Â  The circuit court held \r\n  that a recovery would be an absurd and unjust result due to the significant \r\n  amount of non-probate assets Wifeâ€™s estate received after Husbandâ€™s death.Â  \r\n  However, we can envision numerous situations in which an absurd result would \r\n  occur if the elective share were denied to a surviving spouseâ€™s estate even \r\n  when a valid election has been made during the life of the surviving spouse.Â  \r\n  For example, it would be absurd to deny Wifeâ€™s estate the right to recovery \r\n  here, but allow it if the Wife had died the day after the hearing determining \r\n  her share, but prior to the issuance of the final order.Â  \r\nÂ Our legislature has mandated that a surviving \r\n  spouse is entitled to recover an elective share unless the spouse has made a \r\n  valid waiver in writing.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 62-2-204 (Supp. 2001).Â  â€œThus, \r\n  the legislature has indicated that the right to receive the elective share is \r\n  a substantial one.â€Â  Seifert v. Southern Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, \r\n  305 S.C. 353, 357, 409 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1991).Â  Any benefits the surviving spouse \r\n  may obtain through non-probate assets of the deceased spouseâ€™s estate are immaterial \r\n  to the surviving spouseâ€™s right to seek an elective share of the estate.Â  Therefore, \r\n  it was improper for the circuit court to consider the non-probate assets.\r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Debt Repayment\r\nGallagher next argues the circuit court erred in reversing \r\n  the probate courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees and the $8,000 debt repayment.Â  \r\n  Specifically, he argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to decide these \r\n  issues.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code \r\n  Ann. Â§62-1-308(a) (Supp. 2001) requires that notice of an intent to appeal from \r\n  the probate court to the circuit court must be filed and served within ten days \r\n  after receipt of the probate courtâ€™s written order.Â  The statute further requires \r\n  that the grounds for appeal must be filed and served within forty-five days \r\n  after receipt of the written order.Â  Evert received the probate courtâ€™s final \r\n  order on September 7, 1999, but did not file his notice of intent to appeal \r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and debt repayment until October 4, 1999.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Evert did not file and serve his grounds for appeal until November 2, 1999.Â  \r\n  Because he did not timely appeal from the probate court, the circuit court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to address these issues.Â  Accordingly, we reinstate \r\n  the probate courtâ€™s order awarding the $8,000 debt repayment and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to Wifeâ€™s estate. [5] Â  See Witzig v. Witzig, 325 S.C. \r\n  363, 366-67, 479 S.E.2d 297, 298 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding respondentâ€™s appeal \r\n  from the probate court to the circuit court not timely filed, thus, reinstatement \r\n  of the probate courtâ€™s order was required).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the circuit court erred in determining \r\n  that Wifeâ€™s estate was not entitled to pursue her elective share from Husbandâ€™s \r\n  estate and remand to the probate court for a determination of the elective share. \r\n  Additionally, we vacate the circuit courtâ€™s ruling with respect to attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and debt repayment and reinstate the probate courtâ€™s award of the fees \r\n  and $8,000 to Wifeâ€™s estate. \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED IN PART, and VACATED IN PART.\r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]\r\n  Wifeâ€™s claim as an omitted spouse was \r\n    denied by the probate court, which found that Husband adequately provided \r\n    for her outside of the will, leaving her with $219,351.99 in non-probate assets.Â  \r\n    Gallagher does not appeal the denial of the omitted spouse claim. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Initially, we questioned whether \r\n    Evert preserved this issue for our review because he never made a motion to \r\n    dismiss to the circuit court for failure to comply with Rule 59(g)Â  See \r\n    Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 \r\n    (2000) (stating in order to preserve issue for appellate review issue must \r\n    have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge).Â  However, because \r\n    the issue goes to the circuit courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction to hear \r\n    the motion, we address the merits of Evertâ€™s argument.Â  See Brown \r\n    v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001) (stating issues raising \r\n    questions of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised for the first time \r\n    on appeal).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] We foreclose any question that Wife was not a surviving spouse as \r\n    contemplated by the statute as she did not fall within any of the categories \r\n    that defines who is not to be considered a surviving spouse under S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 62-2-802(b) (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Only one state, New Jersey, holds a contrary view.Â  Unlike South \r\n    Carolina and other states, the New Jersey elective share statute is a â€œneed \r\n    basedâ€ statute, â€œwhich differs significantly from the Uniform Probate Code \r\n    from which the elective share is derived.â€Â  In the Matter of the Estate \r\n    of Bilse, 746 A.2d 1068, 1092-93 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2000).Â  New \r\n    Jersey courts have interpreted the â€œprimary purpose of the statute may not \r\n    be simply to provide an inheritance to the survivorâ€™s heirs.â€Â  Id. \r\n    at 1092.Â  Because New Jersey uses an augmented estate method in determining \r\n    the amount of the elective share, the effect is to â€œgrant a share [to the \r\n    surviving spouse] only to the extent that is required for support.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]\r\n   We note that the probate court erred \r\n    in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wifeâ€™s estate.Â  As a general rule, â€œattorneyâ€™s \r\n    fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.â€Â  Dowaliby \r\n    v. Chambless, 344 S.C. 558, 561, 544 S.E.2d 646, 647-48 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n    There is no statutory provision that allows for the recovery of attorneyâ€™s \r\n    fees for elective share proceedings.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302 \r\n    (Supp. 2001).Â  However, as Evert failed to appeal the propriety of the award, \r\n    this is now the law of the case.Â  See Buckner v. Preferred Mut. \r\n    Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) (stating an unchallenged \r\n    ruling, â€œright or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmanceâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
