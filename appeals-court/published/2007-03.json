Ros Huff, Jr., of Irmo, for Appellant.\r\nGrady L. Beard, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â In this workersâ€™ compensation action, the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (SCWCC) found Claimant Isiah Porter (Porter) and Labor Depot did not have an employer-employee relationship.Â  Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not have jurisdiction to award benefits. Â The circuit court affirmed the Decision and Order of the Appellate Panel.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPorter was injured on August 4, 2002, when he fell approximately twenty to thirty feet while allegedly working as a Labor Depot employee on the Strom Thurmond Fitness Center construction site in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transported Porter to Richland Memorial Hospital where he was diagnosed with a dislocated hip and multiple fractures. Â Subsequently, Porter underwent surgery on his hip and cervical spine to repair his injuries.Â  As of his workersâ€™ compensation hearing date, Porter had not reached maximum medical improvement. \r\nThe Richland Memorial Hospital emergency room and consultation reports noted Porter was positive for ethyl alcohol (ETOH) on the day of the accident.Â  Porter admitted to emergency room personnel he had been drinking earlier that day. Â He disclosed he usually drank about one and one half pints of liquor and one to two quarts of beer per day.Â  Porterâ€™s own testimony at the hearing confirmed he had a life-long history of drinking alcohol. Â He drank every day prior to August 4, 2002.Â  Additionally, Porterâ€™s medical history revealed reports of alcohol abuse on four previous occasions: September 7, 1993; November 27, 1997; March 8, 2002; and May 7, 2002.Â  \r\nPorter was single and fifty-one years old at the time of the August 4, 2002 accident.Â  He attended school through the seventh grade, studied automobile painting and body work with Job Corps, and was employed primarily in janitorial and laborer jobs.Â  Porter has not worked in any capacity following the accident. \r\nLabor Depot denied Porterâ€™s claim for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, maintaining he was not a Labor Depot employee.[1]Â  Porter testified he completed an employment application and worked for Labor Depot for approximately six months prior to the accident.Â  His duties included cleaning up around the landfill and on construction sites.Â  He earned $300-$350 weekly.Â  On the day of the accident, a Sunday, Porter went to work at 3:00 p.m. and had been on the job for approximately forty-five minutes when the accident occurred.Â  He did not know the name of his supervisor or the name of the construction company on the job site that day, nor did he produce any documentation by way of check stubs or income tax returns as evidence of his employment with Labor Depot.Â  Robert Brown, allegedly a co-worker employed by Labor Depot, testified he worked with Porter on August 4, 2002 and witnessed the accident.Â  Brown did not present any additional evidence, other than his testimony, that he and Porter were employees of Labor Depot.Â  In addition, South Carolina Employment Security Commission (SCESC) records from 2002 showed no evidence of any employment relationship between Porter and Labor Depot. \r\nA Form 12A, Employerâ€™s First Report of Injury, dated October 30, 2002, was filed electronically with the SCWCC on Labor Depotâ€™s behalf.Â  An undated, handwritten First Report of Injury or Illness was prepared by Capital City Insurance (Carrier).Â  Porter filed a Form 50 requesting a hearing on January 29, 2004 and an Amended Form 50 on August 2, 2004.Â  The hearing before the single commissioner on September 21, 2004, resulted in the following dispositive finding:\r\n\r\nClaimant failed to meet his burden of proving, by the greater weight of evidence, that he was an employee of defendant, Labor Depot. Â Therefore, I find that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission does not have jurisdiction to decide the matter.Â  This Finding is based on the testimony of the witnesses, including the claimant, the exhibits, or lack thereof, presented by each party, and the discretion of the Hearing Commissioner as the fact finder in this case to properly weigh the evidence and judge witness credibility.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Decision and Order of the Appellate Panel sustained and adopted the single commissionerâ€™s Order in its entirety.Â  On appeal, the circuit court issued a Form 4 Order stating:Â  â€œDecision of the Commission is affirmed.â€\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n(1) Did the circuit court err as a matter of law in issuing a form order without making findings of fact or conclusions of law for review by the appellate court?\r\n(2) Did the circuit court err as a matter of law in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s Decision and Order that Porter was not an employee of Labor Depot? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nJudicial review of a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision is governed by the substantial evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures Act. Baxter v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43 (2006); Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000).Â  However, if the factual issue before the Commission involves a jurisdictional question, this courtâ€™s review is governed by the preponderance of evidence standard. Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2002); Vines v. Champion Bldg. Prods., 315 S.C. 13, 431 S.E.2d 585 (1993); Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 498 S.E.2d 650 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Consequently, our review is not bound by the Commissionâ€™s findings of fact on Â jurisdiction. Â Id.Â  A reviewing court has both the power and duty to review the entire record, find jurisdictional facts without regard to conclusions of the Commission on the issue, and decide the jurisdictional question in accord with the preponderance of evidence. Â Canady v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 265 S.C. 21, 25, 216 S.E.2d 755, 757 (1975); see also Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 314 S.C. 43, 443 S.E.2d 803 (1994) (holding this court can find facts in accordance with the preponderance of evidence when determining a jurisdictional question in a Workersâ€™ Compensation case); Sanders v. Litchfield Country Club, 297 S.C. 339, 377 S.E.2d 111 (Ct. App. 1989) (deciding where a jurisdictional issue is raised, this court must review record and make its own determination whether the preponderance of evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s factual findings bearing on that issue).\r\nThe existence of the employer-employee relationship is a jurisdictional question. Â Nelson, 349 S.C. at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 112; South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commâ€™n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 459 S.E.2d 302 (1995); Edens v. Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 597 S.E.2d 863 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Lake, 330 S.C. at 247, 498 S.E.2d at 653 (holding existence of employer-employee relationship is jurisdictional question; injured workerâ€™s employment status, as it affects jurisdiction, is matter of law for decision by court and includes findings of fact that relate to jurisdiction). Â \r\nThe question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Â Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 528 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2000); Roper Hosp. v. Clemons, 326 S.C. 534, 484 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  On appeal from the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, this court may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Act No. 387, 2006 S.C. Acts 387, eff. July 1, 2006); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The appellant bears the burden of showing that the circuit courtâ€™s decision is against the preponderance of evidence.Â  Gray, 339 S.C. at 182, 528 S.E.2d at 440 (citing Â Lake, 330 S.C. at 246, 498 S.E.2d at 653).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Circuit Judgeâ€™s Form Order\r\nPorter contends the circuit court erred in failing to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of whether an employer-employee relationship between Porter and Labor Depot existed. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nAdvancing his contention, Porter relies on Bowen v. Lee Process Sys. Co., 342 S.C. 232, 536 S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 2000), wherein this court remanded the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment for an order more specifically identifying the grounds for its ruling.Â  In Bowen, we were unable to discern from the trial courtâ€™s decision â€œwhether the court found Defendants owed no duty to [Plaintiff], whether they owed a duty to [Plaintiff] and breached it, or whether they were negligent, but not grossly negligent.â€ Â Bowen, 342 S C. at 240, 536 S.E.2d at 90. Â In order to review the issue adequately, we required the trial court to articulate its rationale and legal analysis more precisely. Â Similarly, in B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 271, 603 S.E.2d 629, 631-32 (Ct. App. 2004), we instructed: \r\n\r\nOn appeal from the grant of summary judgment, an appellate court must determine whether the trial courtâ€™s stated grounds for its decision are supported by the record. Â It is our duty to undertake a thorough and meaningful review of the trial courtâ€™s order and the entire record on appeal. Â Where, as here, the trial court fails to articulate the reasons for its action on the record or enter a written order outlining its rationale, we simply cannot perform our designated function.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all situations require a detailed order, and the trial courtâ€™s form order may be sufficient if the appellate court can ascertain the basis for the trial courtâ€™s ruling from the record on appeal. Â Clark v. S.C. Â Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 353 S.C. 291, 578 S.E.2d 16 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œ[T]here is no blanket requirement that the trial court set forth a separate explanation on all of its rulings.â€ Â Id. at 312, 578 S.E.2d at 26; see also Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 550 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 2001) cert. dismissed as improvidently granted 354 S.C. 57, 579 S.E.2d 605 (2003) (holding a form order stating only that the appellantâ€™s post-trial motions for JNOV and new trial were denied was, together with the record of the proceedings, adequate to enable appellate review).\r\nIt is well settled that â€œ[t]he findings of fact of an administrative body must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been properly applied to those findings.â€ Â Heater of Seabrook, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of S.C., 332 S.C. 20, 26, 503 S.E.2d 739, 742 (1998).Â  Furthermore, courts reviewing the decisions of administrative agencies may look to written documents as well as records of proceedings as sufficient formats for final decisions.Â \r\nAustin v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 362 S.C. 29, 34, 606 S.E.2d 209, 212 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nHere, the circuit court placed its imprimatur on the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law by affirming the Panelâ€™s decision.Â  Accordingly, the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law, as incorporated by reference to the single commissionerâ€™s order, became those of the circuit court.Â  The order encapsulated the single commissionerâ€™s Â Â ruling: \r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has carefully considered and reviewed all of the evidence presented by both parties in this claim, including the Claimantâ€™s testimony and the APA Submissions.Â  From this evidence it is found as a fact that:\r\n1.&nbsp; The claimant was not an employee of The Labor Depot, and the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, therefore, lacks jurisdiction over this alleged claim.\r\n2.&nbsp; The claimant alleges that he injured his back, neck, right shoulder, and right hip in a work-related accident, when he fell approximately 20 feet at a job site on August 4, 2002.Â  This Finding is based on the Form 50 dated August 2, 2004. \r\n3.&nbsp; The South Carolina Employment Security Commission records from 2002 show no entry for any employment relationship between claimant and defendant, The Labor Depot.Â  In fact, they show claimant did not receive any wages during this time.Â  This Finding is based on defendantâ€™s APAâ€™s # 38-48.\r\n4.&nbsp; Claimant could not name his supervisor or the construction company for which he allegedly performed the work.Â  Claimant also failed to remember when he first began his employment with defendant, The Labor Depot.Â  This Finding is based on the testimony of the claimant.\r\n5.&nbsp; Although claimant stated that he had been paid by check, he produced no check stubs, tax records or other evidence of his employment.Â  This Finding is based on the claimantâ€™s testimony as well as the exhibits or lack thereof submitted by claimant. \r\n6.&nbsp; Claimant failed to meet his burden of proving, by the greater weight of the evidence, that he was an employee of defendant, The Labor Depot.Â  Therefore, I find that the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission does not have jurisdiction to decide the matter.Â  This Finding is based on the testimony of the witnesses, including the claimant, the exhibits or lack thereof, presented by each party, and the discretion of the Hearing Commissioner as the fact finder in this case to properly weigh the evidence and judge witness credibility.\r\n7.&nbsp; Even if claimant were The Labor Depotâ€™s employee, it should be noted that medical records contradict claimantâ€™s testimony that he did not drink any alcohol on August 4, 2002; and also contradict claimantâ€™s testimony about his drinking habits generally.Â  Therefore, I find that claimant was not credible (e.g., claimant testified at the time of the accident that he only drank on weekends; however, notes from EMS and the Emergency Room both state that he was positive for ETOH, and claimant told various health care providers that he drank everyday).Â  This Finding is based on the claimantâ€™s testimony as well as the medical evidence in the record of the case. \r\n8.&nbsp; Because I find that claimant did not prove that he was an employee of The Labor Depot, I do not reach the issue of whether claimant was intoxicated and whether that intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident.Â  This Finding is based on the testimony of the witnesses, including the claimant, and the discretion of the Hearing Commissioner as the fact finder in this case to properly weigh the evidence and rule in the case. \r\n9.&nbsp; Claimantâ€™s request for benefits under the Act is denied.Â  This Finding is based upon all evidence in this case. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing Findings of Fact and is [sic] provided in the South Carolina Code of Law Â§ 42-17-40, as determination of this Commissioner that:\r\n1.&nbsp; Under Â§ 42-1-130, the claimant was not a covered employee at the time in question; therefore, the SCWCC has no jurisdiction over this alleged claim.\r\n2.&nbsp; Under Â§ 42-1-130, Â§ 42-1-160, Â§ 42-9-10 and Â§ 42-15-60, the claimant has failed to carry the burden of proving that he was an employee of the Labor Depot, and that he is entitled to benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act for an accident sustained in the course of his employment with The Labor Depot on August 4, 2002.Â  The claimantâ€™s claim for benefits . . . is, therefore, denied. Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe single commissionerâ€™s detailed findings were sufficient to allow the reviewing court to determine whether those findings were supported by the evidence and whether the law was properly applied to those findings.Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s Decision and Order, together with the record of the proceedings, adequately enabled the reviewing court to perform its designated duty.Â  We find no error with regard to the format of the circuit courtâ€™s order. \r\nII. Â Existence of Employer-Employee Relationship\r\nPorter argues the greater weight of the evidence proves he had an employer-employee relationship with Labor Depot.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCoverage under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act depends on the existence of an employment relationship. Â Edens v. Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 439, 597 S.E.2d 863, 866 (Ct. App. 2004) (citingÂ  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002); McDowell v. Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 41 S.E.2d 872 (1947); Hancock v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 355 S.C. 168, 584 S.E.2d 398 (Ct. App. 2003)); see also Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 184, 528 S.E.2d 435, 441 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œBefore provisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act can apply, an employer-employee relationship must exist; this is an initial fact to be established.â€).Â  Workersâ€™ compensation awards are authorized only if an employer-employee relationship exists at the time of the injury. Â Nelson, 349 S.C. at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 112 (citing Â Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 534 S.E.2d 700 (2000)).Â  \r\nSection 42-1-130 of the South Carolina Code of Laws defines â€œemployeeâ€ as\r\n\r\nevery person engaged in an employment under any appointment, contract of hire, or apprenticeship, expressed or implied, oral or written, including aliens and also including minors, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, but excludes a person whose employment is both casual and not in the course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of his employer; \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2006).\r\nWorkersâ€™ compensation statutes are construed liberally in favor of coverage, and South Carolinaâ€™s policy is to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of employees within workersâ€™ compensation coverage. Â Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 343 S.C. 102, 538 S.E.2d 276 (Ct. App. 2000) affâ€™d 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002) (citing Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992); Oâ€™Briant v. Daniel Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 254, 305 S.E.2d 241 (1983); Horton v. Baruch, 217 S.C. 48, 59 S.E.2d 545 (1950); Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996); McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 313 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1984)).\r\nThe fundamental test of the employment relationship is the right of the employer to control the details of the employeeâ€™s work. Nelson, 343 S.C. at 110, 538 S.E.2d at 280 (citing Â Gray, 339 S.C. at 184-85, 528 S.E.2d at 441).Â  â€œIt is not the actual control then exercised, but whether there exists the right and authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.â€Â  Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 189, 165 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1969); Gray, 339 S.C. at 184-85, 528 S.E.2d at 441.Â  â€œThere are four elements which determine the right of control: 1) direct evidence of the right or exercise of control; 2) furnishing of equipment; 3) right to fire; and 4) method of payment.â€Â  Fuller v. Blanchard, 358 S.C. 536, 542-43, 595 S.E.2d 831, 834 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Nelson, 349 S.C. at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 113.\r\nWhile the appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of evidence on the existence of an employer-employee relationship, the final determination of witness credibility is usually reserved to the Appellate Panel. Â See Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 441, 534 S.E.2d 700, 704 (2000) (citing Ford v. Allied Chem. Corp., 252 S.C. 561, 167 S.E.2d 564 (1969)).\r\nIn support of his argument that the greater weight of evidence supports an employer-employee relationship, Porter offered his own testimony.Â  He averred he completed an employment application, worked for Labor Depot for approximately six months prior to his accident, and received paychecks from Labor Depot in the amount of $300-$350 weekly.Â  Porter claims he reported to work on Sunday, August 4, 2002 at 3:00 oâ€™clock in the afternoon and was instructed by the â€œboss manâ€ to dismantle scaffolding at the Strom Thurmond Fitness Center construction site.Â  About forty-five minutes after he had been on the site, he fell and sustained injuries. Â Porter submits that Labor Depot had the right of control over his employment because the â€œboss manâ€ directed his work activities and Labor Depot told him when and where to work. Â Â Â \r\nPorterâ€™s testimony lacks credibility.Â  He professed to be employed with Labor Depot for approximately six months prior to August 4, 2002.Â  Yet SCESC records showed no evidence of that employment.Â  Moreover, SCESC records indicated Porter drew unemployment compensation from November, 2001, until June 9, 2002.Â  In response to questioning about how he obtained unemployment compensation and worked for Labor Depot at the same time, Porter responded:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       At that time of year you isnâ€™t employed every month.Â  Â  Sometimes they donâ€™t send you out every morning, every Â Â  day.Â  You donâ€™t get out every day.Â  You know you get Â Â Â Â Â Â  about one day a week or something like that.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       I appreciate that, Mr. Porter, but according to these records Â  you were filing for and pursuing unemployment from July of 2001 until June of 2002.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Yeah.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       My question to you is if you were working for my client Â Â Â Â Â Â  during that period of time how were you filing for Â Â Â Â  unemployment every single week?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       I wasnâ€™t making no money.Â  I would probably get out about Â Â  one day a week.Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Porterâ€™s testimony concerning his alcohol consumption, both on the day of the accident and in general, conflicted with medical evidence provided in EMS reports, emergency room records, and prior medical histories. Â Significantly, Porter did not even recall previous injuries that apparently led to his disclosure of alcohol abuse to medical personnel. Â \r\nPorter did not remember the name of the â€œboss manâ€ who supervised the work site on the day of the accident, nor could he name the construction company involved in the project.Â  Robert Brown testified he worked for Labor Depot along with Porter on August 4, 2002, and witnessed the accident.Â  However, like Porter, Brown was unable to provide the name of the supervisor or the construction company.Â  Neither Porter nor Brown offered any documentary evidence of employment with Labor Depot in the form of wage receipts, check stubs, copies of completed applications, W-2 forms, or copies of income tax returns.Â  Concomitantly, we note the absence of personnel records and testimony from Labor Depot that Porter could have subpoenaed to support his position.Â  \r\nPorter invests the Form 12A Employerâ€™s First Report of Injury tendered on Labor Depotâ€™s behalf with more significance than it merits, suggesting that, as a declaration against interest, it was sufficient to establish an employment relationship between Porter and Labor Depot.Â  Porter urges the Form 12A would not have been filed had he not been employed by Labor Depot.[2]Â  Regulation 67-411 of the South Carolina Code Ann. (2006) requires, in pertinent part, that:\r\n\r\nA. Each employer shall keep a record of all injuries, fatal or otherwise, received by its employees in the course of their employment. . . .\r\nB. Â Employerâ€™s Responsibilities\r\n(1) The employer shall make a record of all work-related injuries reported by its employees on the Form 12A and retain the record for a period of two years.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Regs. 67-411 (2006).\r\nTo infer, as Porter urges, that the filed Form 12A represents Labor Depotâ€™s record keeping of an employeeâ€™s injuries strains credulity.Â  On September 26, 2002, the SCWCC Claims Director notified the Carrier that a workersâ€™ compensation claim had been filed against its insured, Labor Depot.Â  The Form 12A in the record on appeal, dated October 30, 2002, was filed by the Carrier, apparently in response to the Claims Directorâ€™s request for the completed form.Â  There is no evidence that anyone reported Porterâ€™s injury directly to Labor Depot.Â  There is evidence, however, that a letter of representation from Porterâ€™s former counsel accompanied the Claims Directorâ€™s request for the Form 12A.Â  Dated September 12, 2002, that letter to the SCWCC, establishing a claim on Porterâ€™s behalf, contained all of the data needed to complete the Form 12A.Â  The more tenable view of what the Form 12A represents in this case is that it was the Carrierâ€™s response to the SCWCCâ€™s notice of a filed claim rather than a representation of Labor Depotâ€™s record keeping of an employeeâ€™s injury. \r\nWhile we are mindful that jurisdictional doubts are generally to be resolved in favor of coverage, more than doubt taints Porterâ€™s claim that he was employed by Labor Depot.Â  Considering the evidentiary record as a whole, including our own view of the testimony, medical reports, and exhibits or lack thereof, we conclude Porter failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that an employer-employee relationship with Labor Depot existed.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe discern no error as a matter of law in the circuit courtâ€™s form order affirming the decision of the Appellate Panel.Â  In addition, we hold Porter failed to prove by the preponderance of evidence that an employment relationship existed.Â  Lucidly, as a matter of law, Porterâ€™s claim does not fall within the jurisdiction of the South Carolina Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n KITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Labor Depot asserted intoxication, among other affirmative defenses, in the event the Appellate Panel determined an employer-employee relationship existed.Â  In concluding that no such relationship existed, the Panel was without jurisdiction to determine whether intoxication was the proximate cause of the accident.Â  Accordingly, the intoxication defense is not before this court for review. \r\n[2]&nbsp; Two Form 12As appear in the record.Â  One Form 12A is handwritten, undated, and apparently prepared by the Carrier.Â  The second Form 12A, dated October 30, 2002 was submitted electronically by the Carrier, apparently through Southeastern Claims Services.Â  At the September 2004 hearing, the single commissioner opined: â€œI think itâ€™s clear that an insurance company filled this [Form 12A] out and not the employer.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4213","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\nand Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; Solicitor John R. Justice, of Chester, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Daniel Edwards, Jr. appeals his convictions for three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victimâ€™s parents divorced when she was five or six years old. Â She lived with her father until she was ten but had regular visitation with her mother and her motherâ€™s husband, the defendant, Daniel Edwards, Jr.Â  When the victim was ten years old, she resumed living with her mother and Edwards. Â The victimâ€™s relationship with Edwards prior to this time was â€œa good one, like father/daughter.â€ Â She stated they would go hunting and fishing together and she felt comfortable with him â€œuntil things started to happen.â€Â  It was after the victim moved in with her mother and Edwards that the sexual assaults began.Â  \r\nEdwards was indicted on three counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, and his case was tried November 15-17, 2004.Â  The victim was sixteen at the time of trial.\r\nThe trial began with the victimâ€™s testimony. Â The jury was excused to allow the solicitor to proffer evidence regarding prior instances of sexual abuse toward the victim by Edwards.Â  The victim testified that the sexual abuse began when she, her mother, and Edwards lived on Golf Course Road in October, 1999. Â She stated she remembered the approximate date because it was â€œa couple of days after he got out of jail for my sister.â€Â  She stated that Edwards started by sitting by her bed and touching her breasts and â€œdown below.â€Â  Edwards continued the abuse a few weeks later when they moved to Nickey Road.Â  When her mother was at work in the evenings, he would sit by her bed and touch and rub her.Â  The victim testified Edwards had sexual intercourse with her four times, three of which were on Nickey Road, as well as having her look at pornographic magazines and watch pornographic tapes. Â The victim testified that on August 25, 2000, her mother left for work, and Edwards took her into his bedroom, took her clothes off, and began touching her breasts.Â  She said when he stepped out of the bedroom for a minute, she slipped out the back door and was able to call for help. Â \r\nEdwards argued the evidence was inadmissible, because there was no common scheme pursuant to Lyle,[1] and because it was more prejudicial than probative. The trial judge disagreed and permitted the testimony. Â Counsel noted his continuing objection to the admission of the evidence.Â  \r\nIn the course of her testimony, the solicitor asked the victim why she had complied with the things Edwards asked her to do.Â  She answered, â€œbecause I have already heard that heâ€™s been hitting my mother.â€Â  Edwards objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing he did not believe there was a curative instruction that could sufficiently remove the prejudice created by the victimâ€™s statement.Â  The trial judge denied the motion for a mistrial and gave a curative instruction when the jury returned to the courtroom. \r\nThe victimâ€™s mother also testified in the case regarding threats made against the victim by Edwards.Â  The record indicates that though they were then estranged, the victimâ€™s mother stayed with Edwards for three years after the charges were brought and was still in communication with him up to the time of the trial.Â  The victimâ€™s mother testified that Edwards told her to tell the victim that she should not show up in court â€œbecause he had a hit out on her, that she wouldnâ€™t make it through the courtroom doors.â€Â  The victimâ€™s mother also testified that Edwards said if he was convicted he would kill the victim when he got out of jail.Â  The trial judge allowed this testimony finding that Edwardsâ€™ statements could be construed as an admission of guilt and a threat to punish the witness should the jury find him guilty.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Edwards guilty of all three charges.Â  Edwards raises three issues on appeal, alleging the trial judge erred in (1) admitting testimony regarding prior sexual conduct between the victim and Edwards, (2) denying Edwardsâ€™ motion for mistrial after the victim testified that Edwards had hit the victimâ€™s mother, and (3) in admitting testimony regarding threats made against the victim if she testified in court. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  See State&nbsp;v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€).Â  â€œThis same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.â€Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error, which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 353, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Admission of Prior Bad Acts \r\nEdwards contends the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of prior acts of sexual misconduct, arguing the evidence did not constitute a common scheme or plan under Mathis and Lyle.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge determined that based largely on State v. Mathis,[2] he would permit â€œsome degree of testimonyâ€ relating to Edwardsâ€™ alleged prior misconduct and that the probative value of the testimony outweighed the prejudice to Edwards under Rule 403 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. Â \r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes evidence of prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime charged.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 211, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006); State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 462, 597 S.E.2d 872, 878 (Ct. App. 2004); see also State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682 (2000) (finding that evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to prove bad character of defendant or that he acted in conformity therewith). Â Such evidence is admissible, however, when it tends to establish â€œa common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the others.â€Â  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923); see also Rule 404(b),\r\nSCRE. \r\nThe common scheme or plan exception is commonly applied in cases of sexual assault where conduct both before and after the acts charged is held admissible to show â€œcontinued illicit intercourse between the same parties.â€Â  Mathis, 359 S.C. at 879, 597 S.E.2d at 463 (citing State v. Weaverling, 377 S.C. 460, 469, 523 S.E.2d 787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  In Mathis, the court admitted evidence of three earlier assaults on the victim where â€œall [three were] attempted in the same manner and under similar circumstances.â€Â \r\nId. at 879, 597 S.E.2d at 464.Â  â€œOverall, the three prior incidents of sexual misconduct by Mathis show the same\r\nillicit conduct with the victim over the course of the nine months prior to [the date of the charged incident].â€Â  Id. at 880, 597 S.E.2d at 464-65.Â  \r\nIn the present case, we find the admission of evidence of prior bad acts is consistent with the exceptions found in Lyle and particularly in Mathis. Â Edwardsâ€™ prior acts occurred over an approximately ten-month span with the same victim and always when the victimâ€™s mother was at work.Â  The conduct began with inappropriate touching, the removal of the victimâ€™s clothes, and finally escalated to sexual intercourse.Â  Edwards also told the victim to â€œkeep this a secret between me and youâ€ and that he would â€œbuy [her] thingsâ€ to keep her quiet. Â These acts constitute a â€œcontinued illicit intercourse between the same parties.â€Â  See Mathis, 359 S.C. at 879, 597 S.E.2d at 463.Â  Additionally, we agree with the trial judge that the probative value of the alleged prior bad acts outweighs the prejudicial effect of admitting the evidence.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Denial of Motion for Mistrial\r\nEdwards argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a mistrial where the jury improperly heard evidence that Edwards had hit his wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 458, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Granting of a mistrial is a serious and extreme measure which should only be taken when the prejudice can be removed no other way.Â  Stanley, 365 S.C. at 34, 615 S.E.2d at 460.Â  â€œGenerally, a curative instruction to disregard the testimony is deemed to have cured any alleged error.â€Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 226, 522 S.E.2d 845, 850 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nThe trial judge found the victimâ€™s statement that she â€œheard he [Edwards] had been hitting [her] motherâ€ was â€œa classic non-hearsay statement because itâ€™s not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  We agree.Â  The victimâ€™s statement went to her state of mind and was not offered to establish that Edwards had actually ever hit her mother.Â  It was offered to explain why the victim behaved as she did.[3]Â  Consequently, the statement was admissible.\r\nFurthermore, we find that any prejudice to Edwards was cured by the judgeâ€™s curative instruction.Â  The jury was instructed to â€œdisregard the last statement given by [the] witness in response to a question that was asked of her,â€ and the trial resumed. Â The instruction was simple and refrained from reiterating or emphasizing the statement as much as possible.Â  Even though the trial judge noted Edwardâ€™s continuing objection, we find the instruction cured any alleged error. Â We can discern no abuse of discretion in the judgeâ€™s denial of Edwardsâ€™ motion for mistrial.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Admission of Threats Against a Witness\r\nEdwards argues the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of alleged threats against the victim.Â  We disagree. \r\nThis appears to be a novel issue to South Carolina, as we have been unable to locate any cases affirming the introduction of such threats into evidence.Â  There are cases, however, addressing the subject but disallowing the evidence, primarily because the threats could not be directly attributed to the defendant.Â  The first such case was State v. Rogers, 96 S.C. 350, 80 S.E. 620 (1914), in which the trial court admitted into evidence an unsigned letter threatening one of the stateâ€™s witnesses.Â  The defendantâ€™s conviction was reversed, and in doing so the court stated, \r\n\r\n[h]is Honor should not have admitted in evidence the letter complained of in the first exception . . . without connecting the defendant in some manner with it.Â  It would have been better to require the State then and there after it was admitted to connect the defendant with it, and upon failure to do so to have ruled it out. Â \r\n\r\nId. at 352, 805 S.E.2d at 621.Â  Similarly, in Mincey v. State, 314 S.C. 355, 368, 444 S.E.2d 510, 511 (1994), the court concluded it was error to allow closing argument about threats or dangers to witnesses unless there was evidence that connected the defendant to such threats. Â \r\nThese cases seem to indicate, without so holding, that had the threats been connected to the defendant they would have been appropriately admitted into evidence. Â Obviously, such threats and other attempts to intimidate witnesses can and do result in criminal charges pursuant to section 16-9-340 of the South Carolina Code (Rev. 2003). Â See State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 613 S.E.2d 381 (Ct. App. 2005) (affirming defendantâ€™s conviction for intimidating victim/witness in connection with his trial for criminal sexual conduct).Â  \r\nLacking explicit precedent in this state, we turn to other jurisdictions to seek guidance.Â  In doing so, we find many other jurisdictions, particularly federal courts, including the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, have addressed the issue of the admissibility during the trial of threats against a witness made by the defendant.Â  The federal court cases generally conclude such threats indicate the defendantâ€™s â€œconsciousness of guiltâ€ and are therefore admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.[4]Â  See U.S. v. Van Metre, 150 F.3d 339, 352 (4th Cir. 1998); U.S. v. Guerrero-Cortez, 110 F.3d 647, 652 (8th Cir. 1997) (acknowledging that â€œ[a]n effort to intimidate a witness tends to show consciousness of guiltâ€); U.S. v. Gatto, 995 F.2d 449, 454-55 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that evidence of threats or intimidation of a witness is admissible under Rule 404(b) to show consciousness of guilt); U.S.&nbsp;v. Maddox, 944 F.2d 1223, 1230 (6th Cir. 1991) (â€œ[S]poliation evidence, including evidence that the defendant threatened a witness, is generally admissible because it is probative of consciousness of guilt.â€); U.S. v. Mickens, 926 F.2d 1323, 1329 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that an effort to intimidate a witness is relevant to the issue of the defendantâ€™s state of mind and admissible under Rule 404(b)); U.S. v. Pina, 844 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that defendantâ€™s threats against adverse witness is probative because it shows â€œthat the defendant is willing to go to extreme measures to exclude relevant evidence from trialâ€). Â \r\nMany state courts also permit the admission of evidence of threats against a witness.Â  See People v. Iannone, 769 N.Y.S.2d 676, 678 (2003) (â€œWhere, as here, there is some evidence connecting defendant to those threats, testimony concerning the threats is admissible on the issue of consciousness of guilt.â€); State v. Soke, 663 N.E.2d 986, 1001 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995) (â€œ[W]e note that evidence of threats or intimidation of witnesses reflects a consciousness of guilt and is admissible as admission by conduct.â€); State v. Hicks, 428 S.E.2d 167, 177 (N.C. 1993) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Buchanan, 543 S.E.2d 823 (N.C. 2001)) (â€œAn attempt by a defendant to intimidate a witness in an effort to prevent the witness from testifying or to induce the witness to testify falsely in his favor is relevant to show the defendantâ€™s awareness of his guilt.â€); Ransom v. State, 920 S.W.2d 288, 299 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (holding criminal acts designed to reduce the likelihood of conviction, including threats against witnesses, are admissible under Rule 404(b) as showing â€œconsciousness of guiltâ€); People v. Lucas, 603 N.E.2d 460, 486 (Ill. 1992) (â€œ[E]vidence of a plan to eliminate witnesses is admissible to show a consciousness of guilt where the scheme is connected to the defendant . . . .â€); Bain v. State, 521 S.E.2d 832, 835 (Ga. Ct. App. 1999) (admitting evidence of defendantâ€™s threats against prosecution witness as â€œindicating a consciousness of guiltâ€); Ragland v. Com., 434 S.E.2d 675, 679 (Va. Ct. App. 1993) (quoting McMillan v. Com., 50 S.E.2d 428, 430 (Va. 1948)) (â€œEvidence that a defendant â€˜procured, or attempted to procure, the absence of a witness, or to bribe or suppress testimony against him, is admissible, as it tends to show the unrighteousness of the defendantâ€™s cause and a consciousness of guilt.â€™â€); and People v. Pinholster, 824 P.2d 571, 611 (Cal. 1992) (admitting evidence of threatening phone call to prosecution witness as showing â€œconsciousness of guiltâ€).Â  \r\nWhile the precedents from other jurisdictions are not controlling, we find them persuasive and in this case elect to adopt their analysis.Â  Just as conflicting statements and attempts to flee are indicative of â€œguilty knowledge and intent,â€[5] so too are the threats communicated here.Â  Consequently, the trial judge did not err in admitting the evidence regarding threats by Edwards against the victim/witness.Â  \r\nWe find the trial judge did not err in admitting prior acts of sexual conduct, denying a mistrial, and admitting evidence of threats against the victim.Â  The decision of the trial judge is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E.2d 803 (1923).Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 597 S.E.2d 872 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; The trial judge found this statement was not intentionally elicited by the prosecution.Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; â€œEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Â It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident . . . .â€Â  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).Â  Rule 404(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence is similar to the federal rule, although as indicated by the reporterâ€™s comments, our state rule is slightly more restrictive regarding for what purposes evidence of other bad acts may be introduced.Â  It provides: Â â€œEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.Â  It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.â€Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; Town of Hartsville v.

Young, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4214\r\nHeard February 7, 2007 â€“ Filed March 12, 2007\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nG. Dana Sinkler, of Charleston; for Appellant.Â  \r\nFrank M. Cisa, of Mt. Pleasant; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Vaughn Development, Inc. filed this breach of contract action against Westvaco Development Corporation.Â  A jury awarded Vaughn Development $37,492.24, and the trial court awarded prejudgment interest.Â  Westvaco appeals the award of prejudgment interest.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1999, Vaughn Development[1] purchased a 19 acre tract of land in Berkeley County from Westvaco for the purpose of developing the tract into single family lots.Â  The contract provided, in part:\r\n\r\nThat water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer and/or drainage outfalls are or shall be installed and operational within the road right-of-way adjacent to the boundary of the Property at no cost or expense to the Purchaser; that such utility installations are or shall be adequate and sufficient to provide such quantities, pressures, and capacities as will permit the utilization of the Property as herein contemplated, and that Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain, at Purchaserâ€™s expense, necessary water and sanitary sewer taps after payment of impact fees, if any, tap-on fees, and user charges as are normally and uniformly imposed by the utility companies or governmental agencies supplying such services[.] Â \r\n\r\nSteve Vaughn, President of Vaughn Development, testified that Joe Collins of Westvaco assured him that Westvaco would pay for the sewer installation.Â  Collins denied making any such assurance. Â \r\nVaughn Development hired Superior Utilities, Inc. to install two sewer mains and manholes and four service crossings at a cost of $88,691. Â Vaughn Development requested reimbursement from Westvaco for this amount by letter dated September 9, 2002. Â The letter included Superior Utilitiesâ€™ cost detail. Â Westvaco responded by stating it would pay only $18,746.12 for the sewer work, which represented the cost of one sewer main based on Superior Utilitiesâ€™ cost detail. Â The jury awarded Vaughn Development $37,492.24, a sum equivalent to the cost of two sewer mains.Â  The court awarded Vaughn Development prejudgment interest.Â  Westvaco appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWestvaco argues the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest because the measure of recovery could not have been determined at the time the claim arose.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nHistorically, the recovery of prejudgment interest was severely limited.Â  Michael S. Knoll, A Primer on Prejudgment Interest, 75 Tex. L. Rev. 293, 294-98 (1996).Â  â€œThe roots of prejudgment interest law are based on centuries-old moral and religious proscriptions against interest and loans.Â  Both the ancient Israelites and Greeks viewed the taking of any interest as usurious.â€Â  Martin Oyos, Comment, Prejudgment Interest in South Dakota, 33 S.D. L. Rev. 484, 485-86 (1988).Â  With the shift from agrarian economies in the common law European countries, and the emphasis in this country from the beginning on the mercantile influence, prejudgment interest has become more favored and the courts now allow prejudgment interest on liquidated amounts.Â  James L. Bernard, Note, Prejudgment Interest and the Copyright Act of 1976, 5 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media &amp; Ent. L.J. 427, 433 (1995).Â  There has been, however, â€œgrowing dissatisfaction with the distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages.Â  As a result, many jurisdictions abandoned it. . . .Â  With the breakdown and rejection of the distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages, courts established more liberal rules for awarding prejudgment interest.Â  Some courts looked to whether the claim was â€˜ascertainable.â€™â€Â  Id. at 434-36.Â  This liberalization of prejudgment law has even led to recovery of prejudgment interest for personal injury damages, usually calculable from the time of a settlement offer or demand.Â  See generally Diane M. Allen, Annotation, Validity and Construction of State Statute or Rule Allowing or Changing Rate of Prejudgment Interest in Tort Actions, 40 A.L.R.4th 147 (1985) (cases and statutes cited therein).\r\nTurning to South Carolina, we find an initial similar trend.Â  In the early part of the last century in South Carolina, the law regarding prejudgment interest was strict.Â  The failure of the party owing money to acknowledge a sum owed prevented a plaintiff from recovering prejudgment interest; the amount due had to be acknowledged and liquidated.Â \r\nWakefield v. Spoon, 100 S.C. 100, 106, 84 S.E. 418, 420 (1915).Â  However, even under this specific rule, the law surrounding prejudgment interest was muddled.Â  Goddard v. Bulow, 10 S.C.L. (1 Nott &amp; McC.) 45, 56 (1818) (â€œIt is not a little extraordinary that a question of every dayâ€™s occurrence, should have remained to this time unsettled . . . .â€).Â  Also similar to the trend in the United States, South Carolina liberalized the rules for awarding prejudgment interest.Â  The governing statute looks to whether the claim is ascertainable.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A) (Supp. 2006) (â€œIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law . . . .â€).Â  â€œIn South Carolina, interest may also be awarded in equity cases, conversion cases, and property cases.â€Â  11 S.C. Juris. Damages Â§ 8 (1992).\r\nIn recent years, our supreme court has explained that prejudgment interest is permitted by operation of law â€œif the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Smith-Hunter Constr. Co. v. Hopson, 365 S.C. 125, 128, 616 S.E.2d 419, 421 (2005).Â  In Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 631 S.E.2d 252 (2006) our supreme court explained:Â  \r\n\r\nStated another way, prejudgment interest is allowed on a claim of liquidated damages; i.e., the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty based on a mathematical calculation previously agreed to by the parties. Â Prejudgment interest is not allowed on an unliquidated claim in the absence of an agreement or statute.Â  The fact that the amount due is disputed by the opposing party does not render the claim unliquidated for the purposes of an award of prejudgment interest. Â \r\n\r\nButler, 369 S.C. at 133, 631 S.E.2d at 258-59 (internal citations omitted).\r\nDespite Smith-Hunter and Butler, the issue of prejudgment interest remains confusing and is often litigated.Â  Accordingly, as an intermediate appellate court, we are unwilling to go beyond these cases most recently decided by our supreme court.Â  Vaughn Development relies on these cases to support the award of prejudgment interest.Â  We find an award of prejudgment interest in this case would expand the interpretation of â€˜ascertainableâ€™ beyond that defined in Smith-Hunter and Butler Contracting.Â  \r\nIn Smith-Hunter, our supreme court affirmed an award of prejudgment interest in a breach of contract action brought by a builder against homeowners.Â  365 S.C. at 128-130, 616 S.E.2d at 421-22.Â  The court found â€œ[t]he measure of recovery was fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.Â  The costs of the work completed by [the builder] at the time of [the homeownersâ€™] breach of contract were established via [the builderâ€™s] invoices.â€Â  Id. at 128, 616 S.E.2d at 421.Â  \r\nIn Butler, a subcontractor sought to recover in an action to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  369 S.C. at 125-27, 631 S.E.2d at 254-55.Â  Our supreme court reversed the trial courtâ€™s denial of prejudgment interest finding although there was an obvious dispute as to the amount owed the subcontractor, â€œ[t]he proper test for determining whether prejudgment interest may be awarded is whether the measure of recovery, not necessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.â€Â  Id. at 133, 631 S.E.2d at 259.\r\nUnlike Smith-Hunter and Butler Contracting, the measure of damages was not fixed in this case.Â  There was an intermediate question that had to be decided before the measure of damages could be ascertained.Â  Under the terms of the contract, the scope of the work required was not certain and the damages could only be measured after that determination was made.Â  The contract provided that the sewer installation â€œshall be adequate and sufficient to provide such quantities, pressures, and capacities as will permit the utilization of the Property as herein contemplated . . . .â€Â  We find the contract is not sufficiently specific to determine the extent of work required by its terms.Â  In addition to the extent of the work, the parties disputed the methods of installation and whether Westvaco would install the sewer or whether Vaughn Development would hire a subcontractor to do the necessary work.Â  These issues were not dictated in the contract.Â  The uncertainty regarding the extent and nature of the construction required under the terms of the contract is the primary factor that distinguishes this case from those relied upon by Vaughn Development.Â  \r\nBecause we find the measure of recovery was not fixed at the time the claim arose, we find the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest.Â  Accordingly, the award of prejudgment interest is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nGOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Vaughn Development is a successor in interest under the contract between Westvaco and Vaughn Homes, Inc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4215","title":"Mosseri v.

Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-10 (1) (Supp. 2005).Â  This jurisdictional limit does not apply to â€œmatters between landlord and tenant and the possession of land as provided in Chapters 33 through 41 of Title 27 . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-10 (10) (Supp. 2005).Â  The magistrateâ€™s court will retain jurisdiction in cases involving landlord and tenant and the possession of land even when any counterclaim exceeds $7,500.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-10 (12) (Supp. 2005).Â  In cases that do not fall under Section 22-3-10 (12) of the South Carolina Code â€œ[w]hen a counterclaim is filed which if successful would exceed the civil jurisdictional amount as provided in Section 22-3-10, then the initial claim and counterclaim must be transferred to the docket of the common pleas court for that judicial circuit.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-30 (Supp. 2005).\r\nChapters 33 through 41 of title 27 of the South Carolina Code deal with creation, construction and termination of leasehold estates, ejectment of tenants, rent, undertenants of life tenants, and the Residential Landlord Tenant Act (which is not applicable to non residential leaseholds).Â  The common theme of chapters 33 through 41 is possession of the property.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLikewise, possession of the property must be in dispute for the case to fall under Section 22-3-10 (10) of the South Carolina Code.Â  Austinâ€™s argues that possession of the property is not an issue in any of the causes of action.Â  In fact, Austinâ€™s does not claim possession and Mosseri does not claim that Austinâ€™s is in wrongful possession of the property.Â  Austinâ€™s moved out of the property when it felt it had been constructively evicted.\r\nWhile it is true this dispute is between a landlord and a tenant, Section 22-3-10 (10) specifically lists an additional requirement for the magistrateâ€™s court to retain jurisdiction: the dispute must involve a â€œlandlord and tenant and the possession of land.â€ (emphasis added). Â Because the statuteâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need for statutory interpretation by this Court.Â  See Grant v. City of Folly Beach, 346 S.C. 74, 79, 551 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2001).Â  \r\nIn this case, the two counterclaims that exceed the $7,500 jurisdictional limit clearly do not involve the possession of land as provided in chapters 33 through 41 of Title 27.Â  The constructive eviction cause of action merely seeks monetary damages caused by Mosseriâ€™s alleged failure to provide the tenant with property which was safe for the purposes for which it was leased.Â  Austinâ€™s was not in possession of the property and did not seek possession of the property when this case was filed.Â  The other cause of action, for loss of business revenue, is likewise not related to possession of the property.\r\nBecause possession of property was never an issue in the underlying case, nor in the counterclaims, and Austinâ€™s counterclaimed for amounts in excess of the magistrateâ€™s courtâ€™s jurisdictional limit as provided in Section 22-3-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), this case should have been transferred to the court of common pleas pursuant to Section 22-3-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED.[1]Â \r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4216","title":"SC District Council of Assemblies v.

Schneider, and several of its members (collectively â€œDefendantsâ€) appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1988, Christian Life Assembly, an Assemblies of God congregation, established a mission church as an outreach to the northeast section of Columbia, South Carolina.Â  The mission church, initially named Gihon Christian Assembly of God, initially met in various locations, including a renovated garage, a daycare center, and the Spring Valley theater.Â  In 1994, the mission church, which in 1991 was renamed Northeast Christian Assembly of God, purchased property on which it later built a worship facility.Â  Sometime later, Schneider, who previously served as the minister of an Assemblies of God congregation in Aiken, became minister of Northeast Christian Assembly.[1]\r\nIn 1999, Northeast Christian Assembly of God, having formerly been under the supervision of the District Council, successfully applied for affiliation with the General Council of the Assemblies of God.[2]Â  In 2001, Northeast Christian Assembly of God, with the District Councilâ€™s approval, changed its name to River of Life International Worship Center. \r\nAlthough Schneider initially supported district-wide activities sponsored and planned by the District Council, his involvement, as well as that by members of River of Life, in these programs began to decline in 2002.Â  On August 11, 2003, Steve Brown, the District Superintendent, wrote to Schneider expressing his concerns about the decreased participation and suggesting the two meet over breakfast.Â  Schneider answered with a letter in which he made statements that caused Brown to question Schneiderâ€™s loyalty to the Assemblies of God[3] and prompted Brown to send another letter to Schneider.Â  In Brownâ€™s second letter, dated August 18, 2003, Brown reminded Schneider of the commitment Schneider made when he applied to become an Assemblies of God minister and advised that a meeting between the two of them was now â€œmandatory.â€ \r\nIn response to Brownâ€™s second attempt to arrange a meeting, Schneider sent an undated letter received by the District Council on September 2, 2003, in which he stated he renounced his ties to the Assemblies of God.[4]Â  He further advised the District Council that River of Life would hold a business meeting after the morning service on September 21, 2003, to discuss changes in its bylaws, including a vote by the congregation regarding a proposed change in affiliation.Â  With this letter, a copy of which was sent to the General Council of the Assemblies of God, Schneider enclosed his license as an Assemblies of God minister. \r\nBefore the District Council received this letter, however, Schneider had already met individually with members of the Management Council of River of Life about his intended change in affiliation, consulted a lawyer about whether the congregation could keep the worship facility if they followed him, and announced to the congregation in an â€œinformal business meetingâ€ after the Sunday service on August 31, 2003, that he was leaving the Assemblies of God to join the International Gospel Outreach, a religious organization headquartered in Alabama.Â  During the August 31st meeting, Schneider also assured the congregation that â€œthis building belongs to us.Â  The district had nothing to do with this.â€Â  The attendees were also advised of the business meeting on September 21, 2003, when the change in River of Lifeâ€™s affiliation would be put to a formal vote.\r\nBrown received a tape recording of the meeting about the same time he received Schneiderâ€™s letter of resignation.Â  The District Council did not immediately accept Schneiderâ€™s resignation because it was considering disciplinary proceedings against him and had to follow certain procedural formalities, including consultation with the General Council.Â  Nevertheless, after reviewing the tape and Schneiderâ€™s second letter, the District Council no longer considered Schneider to be â€œa credentialed minister in good standing,â€ a condition necessary for River of Lifeâ€™s continued affiliation with the General Council. \r\nAfter Schneiderâ€™s announcement on August 31, 2003, numerous present and former parishioners of River of Life sent letters to the local congregation and to the District Council expressing their dismay about River of Lifeâ€™s proposed departure from the Assemblies of God.Â  In all the letters included in the record on appeal, the writers stated they expected their contributions to River of Life would be used to further the purposes of the Assemblies of God.Â  Several of them were pointedly critical about Schneider and the International Gospel Outreach.[5]Â  \r\nNotwithstanding these complaints, the business meeting took place as scheduled on September 21, 2003.Â  The District Council did not send a representative even though Schneider, on the tape, indicated he anticipated someone from the District Council would be present and a member of the Management Council, with Schneiderâ€™s approval, telephoned the District Secretary to invite the District Council officers to the meeting.[6]Â  At the meeting, the congregation voted sixty-three to three to leave the Assemblies of God.Â  Subsequently, the District Council initiated formal disciplinary proceedings against Schneider; and the General Council stripped him of his credentials to serve as a minister in the Assemblies of God.\r\nSince the vote to disaffiliate, the River of Life congregation has continued to occupy and possess the property.Â  On October 15, 2003, the District Council and the three members of the congregation who remained loyal to the Assemblies of God (collectively â€œPlaintiffsâ€) filed this action in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas for a declaratory judgment regarding the possession and control of River of Lifeâ€™s church property. \r\nThe trial court, sitting without a jury, heard the matter on the merits on June 6 and 7, 2005.Â  By order entered August 11, 2005, the trial court granted judgment to Plaintiffs.Â  After Defendants unsuccessfully moved to alter or amend the judgment, they filed this appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS[7]\r\nThe trial court held, as we noted above, the property did not follow River of Life into the International Gospel Outreach denomination.Â  Rather, the trial court held either (1) the General Council of the Assemblies of God, as the â€œruling convocation and ecclesiastical headâ€ of an hierarchical organization of which River of Life had been a part before its congregation voted to leave the Assemblies of God, was entitled to the property at issue; or (2) if not the General Council, then under the constitutions and bylaws of both the General Council and the District Council, the District Council assumed ownership of the property upon River of Lifeâ€™s attempt to disaffiliate.Â  We agree with Plaintiffs that these grounds can be viewed as separate and distinct from each other; therefore, our affirmance of either one of them requires our upholding the appealed order[8] because in either case the possession and ownership of the property belongs to an entity other than the River of Life congregation.Â  We therefore address only the trial courtâ€™s second holding; and based on our review of the record, we conclude the trial court correctly held the District Council was entitled to the property.[9]\r\nThe trial court found that, when Schneider surrendered his ministerâ€™s credentials and announced he was leaving the Assemblies of God, River of Life no longer met the requirements for affiliation with the General Council as set forth in Article XI, section 1(a)(6) of the General Council constitution.Â  Specifically, the trial court cited the mandate within this section that an affiliated local assembly â€œ[m]ake provision for a pastor who is a credentialed minister in good standing with the General Council and a district council.â€ Â The court also made the unchallenged determination that Brownâ€™s testimony that Schneider was not â€œa credentialed minister in good standingâ€ was â€œan ecclesial matterâ€ within the domain of the District Council.[10]\r\nDefendants dispute the finding that River of Life lost its affiliation with the General Council based on River of Lifeâ€™s failure to have a credentialed minister in good standing, but assert only that Schneider remained in â€œgood standingâ€ when the congregation voted to leave the Assemblies of God because the District Council failed to accept Schneiderâ€™s resignation when he tendered it.Â  This question, however, of whether Schneider was not â€œa credentialed minister in good standing with the General Council and a district councilâ€ is not one for the court to decide.Â  \r\nIn any case, it seems to us that the refusal of a governing body of a religious organization to accept a ministerâ€™s resignation would not preclude a finding by that body that a pastor, particularly one who, like the minister here, left the denomination and joined another, was not â€œa credentialed minister in good standingâ€ with the denomination.Â  Indeed, we cannot imagine any circumstance under which a pastor who voluntarily departed from one denomination and joined another could remain â€œa credentialed minister in good standingâ€ with the denomination from which all ties had been severed.[11]Â  \r\nBased on its determination that River of Life lost its affiliation with the General Council because it no longer had â€œa credentialed minister in good standingâ€ with the Assemblies of God, the trial court proceeded to find the status of River of Life became that of a district-affiliated church by operation of Article VI, Section 5 of the General Councilâ€™s Bylaws, a bylaw that spells out the guidelines for minimal membership for General Council affiliated assemblies.Â  We agree with this holding. \r\nArticle VI, Section 5 provides in pertinent part that â€œ[i]f the minimal requirements [for affiliation of a local church with the General Council] have not been attained, the church shall revert to district affiliated status until the minimal requirements for General Council affiliation have been attained.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  In addition, as the trial court noted, although this section previously required a one-year waiting period before the local assembly would revert to district-affiliated status, the General Council amended the provision in 2003 to allow the reversion to be immediate.[12]  \r\nBased on this provision, as amended, and the absence of â€œa credentialed minister in good standingâ€ with the General Council, we hold the trial court correctly found River of Life had reverted to district-affiliated status and, pursuant to Article VII, section 1(b) of the bylaws of the South Carolina District Council, was thus required to â€œconduct all its business in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws for District Affiliated Assemblies as provided by the South Carolina District Council.â€[13]\r\nThe trial court then determined that, because River of Life had become a district-affiliated church, the District Council was entitled to its assets upon the congregationâ€™s decision to leave the Assemblies of God.Â  In support of its finding, the trial court cited Article XI, section 1(b) of the Constitution and Bylaws for District Affiliated Assemblies in Affiliation with the South Carolina District Council of the Assemblies of God,[14] which provides as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the event this local assembly should at any time cease to function as an Assemblies of God church under the jurisdiction of the South Carolina District Council of the Assemblies of God, . . . then the tangible property belonging to said church, real or personal, and all the interest of said church, real or equitable, in any and all property shall be and thereupon become the property of the South Carolina District of the Assemblies of God . . . .\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the District Council is entitled to the disputed property.Â  Under the above-quoted provisions, when the congregation voted to disaffiliate from the Assemblies of God, River of Life â€œcease[d] to function as an Assemblies of God church under the jurisdiction of the District Councilâ€ and the church property â€œthereupon [became] the property of the South Carolina District of the Assemblies of God.â€[15]\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  The brief filed by counsel for the respondents states Schneider became minister of Northeast Christian Assembly â€œ[i]n or around 1999â€; however, the record contains a mortgage dated May 7, 1997, that Schneider, in his capacity as minister of the church, executed on behalf of the Assembly.\r\n[2]Â  According to the Article XI, section 2(a) of the Constitution of the South Carolina District Council of the Assemblies of God, â€œ[g]roups of Pentecostal believers which are still in the formative stages shall be recognized as District Affiliated Assembliesâ€ and â€œshall be under the supervision of the District Presbytery which shall serve as trustees thereof.â€Â  This section further provides that â€œDistrict Affiliated Assemblies which have matured sufficiently to accept their full share of responsibility for the maintenance of scriptural order, shall be entitled to recognition as autonomous General Council affiliated churches.â€ \r\n[3]Â  In this letter, Schneider stated, â€œI am a Christian through and through and not Assemblies of God. Â The Assemblies is simply the fellowship where God has placed me.â€Â  \r\n[4]Â  In his second and final letter, Schneider wrote the following:Â  â€œAs a person who entered this fellowship by my own free choice, I also, now leave by that same free choice. . . . As the apostle Paul said, â€˜I have finished my course.â€™ â€\r\n[5]&nbsp;\r\nFor example, one writer, the plaintiff Kathy A. Switzer, who stated she made tithes and offerings to the church exceeding $42,000, blames Schneider for the congregationâ€™s decision to leave the Assemblies of God.\r\n[6]Â  Brown did meet with the Management Council on September 8, 2003, out of Schneiderâ€™s presence.Â  According to the handwritten minutes of that meeting, it appears Brown discussed the procedural formalities that had to be observed concerning Schneiderâ€™s attempt to resign as an Assemblies of God minister.Â  Brown also expressed his concern about River of Lifeâ€™s low level of participation in District Council events and his sense of betrayal about the attempt to align the congregation with the International Gospel Outreach.Â  He further admonished the Management Council members about abiding by their own bylaws.\r\n[7] Â In their brief, Plaintiffs appear to challenge a determination by the trial court early in the litigation that this case was an equitable matter.Â  In our view, the record supports the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact irrespective of whether we apply a legal or equitable standard of review in this appeal.\r\n[8]Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling that, if the determination of a particular issue is dispositive of an appeal, the appellate court need not review the remaining issues); Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere a decision is based on alternative grounds, either of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.â€).\r\n[9]Â  Defendants have also argued that the trial court should have applied a neutral principles analysis to this controversy.Â  To the extent this argument applies to the trial courtâ€™s determination that River of Lifeâ€™s property had reverted to the District Council upon its attempted secession from the Assemblies of God, we note that â€œunder the â€˜neutral principles of lawâ€™ doctrine, if the resolution of a church property dispute requires the interpretation of a religious doctrine as stated in . . . a . . . constitution, then a civil court hearing the case must defer to the authoritative ecclesiastical bodyâ€™s interpretation of that doctrine.â€Â  66 Am. Jur. 2d Religious Societies, Â§ 44, at 462 (2001).Â  Because the dispute in this case required such an interpretation, the trial court properly deferred to the opinions of the officials of the District Council and the General Council about the changes in the status of River of Life and Schneiderâ€™s status as a credentialed minister in good standing.\r\n[10]&nbsp; See Bramlett v. Young, 229 S.C. 519, 537, 93 S.E.2d 873, 882 (1956) (noting â€œcivil courts have no jurisdiction of ecclesiastical questions and controversiesâ€).\r\n[11]&nbsp; Defendants contend Plaintiffs are estopped to argue that the local affiliated assembly was without a minister because the District Council never accepted Schneiderâ€™s resignation.Â  At best, this argument is conclusory in that it consists of only two sentences in their brief, cites no legal authority whatsoever, and says nothing about how the District Councilâ€™s failure to accept Schneiderâ€™s resignation caused Defendants to change position to their detriment.Â  See American Sur. Co. v. Hamrick Mills, 191 S.C. 362, 373, 4 S.E.2d 308, 313 (1939) (listing the essential elements of estoppel, among them being that the party invoking the doctrine suffered a prejudicial change of position).Â  We therefore do not address the argument.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (deeming an issue abandoned because the appellant failed to â€œprovide arguments or supporting authority for his assertionâ€).Â  In any event, the focus was not whether River of Life had â€œa ministerâ€ but whether its minister was â€œa credentialed minister in good standing.â€\r\n[12]&nbsp;\r\nDefendants contend in a somewhat conclusory fashion that a reversion did not instantaneously flow from a failure of a church to meet minimal requirements.Â  The plain and unambiguous language of the bylaw, however, undermines that argument.Â  Nowhere does the amended bylaw prescribe an amount of time that must pass before a reversion can occur.\r\n[13]&nbsp; In their brief, Defendants asserted the maxim â€œequity aids the vigilantâ€ in support of their contention that the District Councilâ€™s failure to attend the September 21, 2003 meeting and to take other measures to dissuade River of Lifeâ€™s parishioners from voting to leave the Assemblies of God barred Plaintiffs from using the changes in River of Lifeâ€™s status to support the District Councilâ€™s claim to the church property.Â  This argument lacks merit.Â  Defendants failed to explain how the District Councilâ€™s alleged inaction inured to their prejudice.Â  Cf. Harvey v. Art Metal, Inc., 247 S.C. 443, 449, 147 S.E.2d 697, 701 (1966) (â€œ[A]n essential element of the defense of equitable estoppel is material prejudice to the party asserting the defense resulting from the act or neglect of the party against whom it is asserted.â€).\r\n[14]&nbsp; During oral argument and in reply to Plaintiffsâ€™ argument, Defendants argued for the first time to this court that Article XI was included only in a draft or proposed document and had never been adopted.Â  The Plaintiffs, on the other hand, in a post-hearing memorandum, designated this document as one of several that does indeed control the result here, thereby suggesting it had been adopted.Â  Although counsel for Defendants stated he objected to the document, we found nothing in the voluminous, often confusing, record presented to this court that corroborates his assertion that an objection was made.Â  Assuming without deciding Defendants raised this issue at trial, the trial court never addressed it in the appealed order, and Defendants failed to raise it in their motion to alter or amend.Â  Also, Defendants do not list the issue as among the Statement of Issues on Appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of issues on appeal.â€); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding that, when the trial court does not explicitly rule on an issue at trial and the appellant fails to move to alter or amend the judgment on that ground, the issue is not properly before appellate court and should not be addressed).Â  \r\n[15]&nbsp; We do not overlook the rights provided in Article XI, section 1(c), of the constitution of the General Council of the Assemblies of God, including â€œthe right to acquire and hold title to property, either through trustees or its corporate name as a self-governing unit.â€Â  This provision, however, does not override other relevant provisions in the constitution of the General Council or those included in other governing documents of the General Council or the District Council.Â  Cf. State v. Prince, 335 S.C. 466, 472, 517 S.E.2d 229, 232 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[T]he court should not consider the particular clause being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.â€) (citing South Carolina Coastal Council v. South Carolina State Ethics Commâ€™n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, 410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991)).Â  Here, the rights at issue are granted only to â€œeach General Council affiliated assembly.â€ Â (Emphasis added.)Â  When Schneider severed his ties with the Assemblies of God, River of Life was no longer affiliated with the General Council and, consequently, lacked the requisite status to exercise the rights of self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4217","title":"Fickling v.

Stuckey, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Patricia Fickling brought this negligence action against the City of Charleston after she stepped into a hole in a sidewalk and fell, sustaining injuries.Â  The sidewalk was located within the municipal limits, but on a right-of-way owned by the State of South Carolina.Â  The trial court, sitting without a jury, granted the Cityâ€™s motion for a â€œdirected verdict,â€[1] finding as a matter of law the City had no duty to inspect and repair the sidewalk under South Carolina statutory law, general common law, or the theory of a voluntary undertaking.Â  The trial court further found the City had no notice, either actual or constructive, of the defect as a matter of law.Â  Fickling appeals.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn October 1999, Fickling visited the City while attending a four-day landscape design class offered at the Charleston Museum.Â  Sometime after 4:00 p.m. on October 13, 1999, Fickling decided to walk down Meeting Street towards the Market Street area to do some shopping after her class.Â  After walking several blocks, Fickling stepped into a hole in the sidewalk on the 300 block of Meeting Street and fell.Â  At the time, the hole was partially covered by leaves. Â A photograph taken of the area indicates the sidewalk appears to have been crushed in.Â  Large cracks radiated out from a dirt hole that had formed where a portion of the sidewalk had been.Â  In the middle of the dirt hole, however, one piece of concrete remained.Â  The affected area was about two feet long, two feet across, and approximately three and a half inches deep.Â  \r\nFickling broke her right arm, badly injured her knees, and sustained bruises and abrasions in the fall.Â  She incurred $53,376.66 in medical bills for surgeries on her broken arm and on both of her damaged knees, as well as other medical expenses.Â  She underwent medical treatment from October 1999 to April 2002 as a result of the accident and continues to have pain from her injuries.Â  \r\nFickling filed this negligence action against the City in October 2002, alleging the Cityâ€™s failure to maintain the sidewalk proximately caused her injuries.[2]Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that the section of Meeting Street where the accident occurred is located on a right-of-way owned by the State.[3]Â  The City presented the testimony of Laura Sullivan Cabiness, the Director of the Cityâ€™s Department of Public Service, who stated the City typically repairs sidewalks only after receiving notification of a defect and generally does not conduct inspections.Â  Cabiness stated if someone, such as a member of the public or a City employee, calls in a report about a defect, the call is usually forwarded to either the Cityâ€™s Engineering Division or its Streets and Sidewalks Division, both of which are part of the Department of Public Service, to follow up and inspect the reported defect and determine whether repairs should be made and who is responsible for making the repairs.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen the City receives a complaint about a State-owned right-of-way, the City first notifies the State about the problem and generally will make repairs only if it receives a response from the State explaining the State lacks sufficient funds to make the repairs or if it receives no response from the State.Â  The City receives complaints about streets and sidewalks at its Engineering Division or its Streets and Sidewalks Division and records all complaints.Â  No complaints or work orders were found regarding the area of Meeting Street where Fickling fell.Â  \r\nFickling presented evidence that the Charleston Police Department has foot patrols, horse patrols, and vehicle patrols on Meeting Street.Â  Parking enforcement officers and sanitation workers also cover Meeting Street.Â  A City fire department station is located about two and a half blocks from where Fickling fell.Â  She contended the City had a duty to maintain the streets and sidewalks and it had notice, either actual or constructive, of the defect.Â  Fickling noted the City fielded calls about defects in the sidewalks and undertook repair and maintenance of sidewalks located within the municipal limits.Â  \r\nThe City moved for a directed verdict. Â The trial court granted the motion, ruling as a matter of law that the City had no duty to inspect and maintain the sidewalk and that, in any event, it had no actual or constructive notice of the defect.Â  The trial court thereafter denied Ficklingâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, we must employ the same standard as the trial court â€“ that is, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.[4]Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is required to deny the motion if either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.[5] Â When considering a motion for a directed verdict, neither the appellate court nor the trial court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.[6]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Statutory Duty\r\nOn appeal, Fickling first argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict as to whether section 5-27-120 of the South Carolina Code imposes a statutory duty on the City to keep all streets in good repair and thus to inspect and maintain the sidewalk in question.Â  \r\nSection 5-27-120 generally provides that a city having over one thousand inhabitants shall keep all streets within the city in good repair.Â  This statutory section provides as follows:\r\n\r\nThe city or town council of any city or town of over one thousand inhabitants shall keep in good repair all the streets, ways and bridges within the limits of the city or town and for such purpose it is invested with all the powers, rights and privileges within the limits of such city or town that are given to the governing bodies of the several counties of this State as to the public roads.[7]\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Code defines a â€œsidewalkâ€ as a portion of a street.[8]Â  \r\nIn Vaughan v. Town of Lyman,[9] our supreme court recently considered this precise question and held that section 5-27-120 â€œdoes not create a â€˜special dutyâ€™ upon which an individual may base a tort action against a municipality.â€[10]Â  The court explained section 5-27-120 defines a municipalityâ€™s duty to the general public to maintain its streets, but it does not establish an â€œidentifiable class of personsâ€ intended to be protected and thus the public duty rule[11] would preclude a private right of action based on the statute.[12]Â  Because section 5-27-120 does not impose a duty upon the City in the circumstances present here, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict as to whether the City had a statutory duty to repair and maintain the sidewalks within the municipal limits.\r\nII.Â  Common Law Duty or Voluntary Undertaking\r\nFickling next argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of the City as to whether the City owed her a duty either under the general common law or under a theory of voluntary undertaking to maintain the sidewalks within the City limits.Â  \r\na.Â  Common Law\r\nIn Vaughan, a pedestrian brought a negligence action against the Town of Lyman after she tripped and fell on the Lawrence Street sidewalk, injuring her hands, right knee, back, and spine.[13]Â  Over time, the sidewalk had become broken by overgrown tree roots.[14]Â  Â Â \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to the Town, finding as a matter of law the Town did not owe a duty to Vaughan because it did not own, maintain, or control the sidewalk where Vaughan fell.[15]Â  The trial court based its decision on several items, including an affidavit that explained Lawrence Street is owned by Spartanburg County and maintained by the State Highway Department, deeds showing the transfer of Lawrence Street to Spartanburg County, and photographs of street signs that indicated Lawrence Street is part of the State Highway System.[16]Â  Â Â \r\nOur supreme court reversed, holding there was a genuine issue of material fact so as to preclude the entry of judgment as a matter of law regarding whether the Town owed a duty to Vaughan to maintain its sidewalks under either the common law or under the theory of a voluntary undertaking.[17]Â  \r\nRegarding a common law duty, the court, citing section 57-5-140[18] of the South Carolina Code, noted ownership of the street (and sidewalk) is not dispositive because â€œownership and maintenance of the sidewalk by another entity does not prevent [the Town] from also maintaining or controlling the same sidewalk.â€[19]Â  \r\nThe court noted Vaughan had submitted deposition testimony â€œto show that [the Town] exercised at least some control over Lawrence Street.â€[20]Â  Specifically, Vaughan had submitted depositions from several persons to show the Town had assumed responsibility for the general maintenance of the streets and sidewalks by removing trees and filling potholes and it fielded citizen complaints about the streets and sidewalks.[21]Â  The Town minutes also contained several references to actions taken by the Town to correct problems related to the Townâ€™s sidewalks.[22]Â  \r\nThe court observed more than one inference could be drawn from the evidence when it was viewed in the light most favorable to Vaughan, the non-moving party.[23]Â  Summary judgment was, therefore, inappropriate on the issue of the Townâ€™s common law duty to Vaughan because, the court held, â€œthere is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether [the Town] exercised any control over the streets in the [T]own, specifically Lawrence Street.â€[24]Â  \r\nSimilarly, in the current appeal, there is evidence that the City made repairs to sidewalks within the municipality and, thus, exercised some measure of control over both the municipal- and State-owned areas.Â  The only limitation was, according to the City, that it would make repairs only as things were reported to it and would first check with the State to see if it would act before making any repairs.Â  This limitation, however, does not alter the fact that the City exercised some measure of control over both municipal- and State-owned streets and sidewalks.Â  \r\nThe trial court here focused on ownership, stating â€œalthough one falls on a city sidewalk, that in itself is not sufficient to establish that the City has ownership and, therefore, a duty to inspect and maintain all sidewalks.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  We believe Vaughan has recently clarified however, that ownership is not the dispositive element in evaluating whether a duty exists; rather, control over the premises is the determinative factor.\r\nIt is unclear from the Vaughan case whether our supreme court would differentiate our current appeal based on the degree of control exerted by the City; i.e., the City here purported to exert a â€œlimitedâ€ measure of control over property with the municipal limits.Â  The Vaughan court did, however, base its determination that summary judgment was inappropriate on the ground there was conflicting evidence as to whether the Town â€œexercised any controlâ€ over the streets and sidewalks.[25]Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the current case, as in Vaughan, the issue was decided by the trial court as a matter of law and, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Fickling, as we are required to do, we hold there is more than one inference that may be drawn as to whether the City exercised any control over the sidewalks in the municipal limits, including the sidewalk at issue here. Â We therefore hold the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to the City regarding the Cityâ€™s common law duty to maintain the sidewalk on Meeting Street. Â \r\nb.Â  Voluntary Undertaking\r\nIn Vaughan, our supreme court additionally found the issue of whether the Town owed a duty to Vaughan based on a voluntary undertaking of the repair and maintenance of the Townâ€™s streets and sidewalks was inappropriately decided as a matter of law on summary judgment because the evidence was susceptible of more than one reasonable inference.[26]Â  The court stated the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment â€œwas primarily based on evidence of ownership of Lawrence Street by Spartanburg County and the Stateâ€™s authority over the street as a result of including it in the State Highway System.â€[27]Â  The court noted that ownership was not determinative, however, of whether the Town voluntarily undertook the duty to maintain the Townâ€™s streets and sidewalks, including Lawrence Street.[28]Â  \r\nOur supreme court stated Vaughan had presented some evidence regarding a voluntary undertaking, such as references to sidewalk maintenance in the Town minutes, Town ordinances regulating the sidewalks, and deposition testimony showing the Town was aware of the condition of Lawrence Street without reporting the condition to any other authority.[29]Â  Â Â Vaughan also submitted evidence indicating the Town had previously handled complaints about the sidewalks from Town residents and had removed hazardous tree roots disrupting the sidewalks.[30]Â  Our supreme court concluded there was â€œa genuine issue of fact regarding whether [the Town] undertook the duty of maintaining city streets, even though all city streets were not owned by [the Town].â€[31]Â  \r\nIn the appeal now before us, Fickling presented evidence that the City had fielded complaints from residents about hazards to the sidewalks, had maintained a log of calls from residents, including repair calls, and had a policy in place, as well as employees, to handle repairs to sidewalks within the municipal limits, including those that were City-owned and those that were non-owned. Â The trial court expressly found the City admittedly engaged in a voluntary undertaking in this instance, but noted in its order:Â  â€œAlthough the City in the instant case admits that it undertakes an obligation to maintain and repair public sidewalks, it only does so when it has notice of the dangerous condition or when the City creates the condition itself.â€Â  In this case as in Vaughan, however, we believe there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City had undertaken a duty of maintaining streets within the municipality, including Meeting Street.Â  \r\nMoreover, there was conflicting evidence presented as to whether the City had constructive notice[32] of the defect in the Meeting Street sidewalk.Â  In the light most favorable to Fickling, there was at least some evidence that (1) there were numerous City personnel within the area of the defect who could have seen and reported the problem;[33] (2) the condition had existed for a while;[34] and (3) the City had an established policy in place to deal with defects in the sidewalks, and problems with the sidewalks were an expected and â€œrecurrentâ€[35] or â€œcontinualâ€[36] condition of which it had notice.[37]\r\nWe therefore conclude the issue regarding whether the City owed Fickling a duty on the basis of a voluntary undertaking should not have been decided as a matter of law and the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to the City on this basis.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the grant of a directed verdict in favor of the City on the ground section 5-27-120 imposes no statutory duty on the City that would create a private right of action is affirmed.Â  The grant of a directed verdict to the City on the issues of whether there was a common law duty or a voluntary undertaking by the City is reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We recognize that a motion for a directed verdict under Rule 50, SCRCP, is appropriate only in jury trials. Â See Hinton v. Designer Ensembles, Inc., 335 S.C. 305, 318 n.3, 516 S.E.2d 665, 671 n.3 (Ct. App. 1999), revâ€™d on other grounds, 343 S.C. 236, 540 S.E.2d 94 (2000).Â  Rule 41(b), SCRCP, permits a defendant, when an action is tried, as here, by the court without a jury, to â€œmove for a dismissal.â€Â  If granted, the dismissal, except in three well-defined instances not applicable here, will operate as an adjudication upon the merits unless the court in its order â€œotherwise specifies.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, the trial court granted a directed verdict pursuant to a motion for a directed verdict made by the City.Â  In doing so, the trial court specified it granted the Cityâ€™s motion pursuant Rule 50(a), SCRCP, the rule applicable to motions for directed verdict, and, citing prior opinions of the supreme court and of this court, employed the standard that a trial court must use in determining whether to grant a directed verdict. Moreover, the trial court in its subsequent order denying Ficklingâ€™s motion for reconsideration again specified it had â€œdirect[ed] a verdict in favor of the defendant.â€Â  \r\nAside from all that, both parties treated the order appealed from as one granting a directed verdict to the City as a matter of law.Â  Neither brief to this court contained an argument that we should treat the trial courtâ€™s ruling as an adjudication on the merits.Â  See Ducworth v. Neely, 319 S.C. 158, 159 n.1, 459 S.E.2d 896, 897 n.1 (Ct. App. 1995) (viewing an order of judgment in which the trial court stated it had directed a verdict for the plaintiff as amounting to a judgment on the merits).Â  Indeed, the City in its brief referred to cases in which the directed verdict standard was applied.Â  The City asserted the evidence yielded only one inference and maintained Ficklingâ€™s â€œcomplaint fail[ed] as a matter of law.â€Â  The City concluded its brief by stating â€œthe court should affirm the trial courtâ€™s order and directed verdict.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  For her part, Fickling asserted the following:Â  â€œThe [trial] court erred in granting a directed verdict to the City where the evidence was capable of yielding more than one inference.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\nAt any rate, an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and neither party here took any exception to the method by which the trial court concluded the case.Â  See Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 583 n.2, 500 S.E.2d 496, 498 n.2 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting a trial courtâ€™s ruling on an issue becomes the law of the case where the appellant fails to take exception to it both before the trial court and on appeal).Â  Certainly, the City should not be heard to complain of a result that its own conduct induced.\r\nMoreover, for us to view the order as an adjudication on the merits would turn the evidence in this case on its head.Â  Instead of viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Fickling, the non-moving party, which we would be required to do for a directed verdict, we would be required, if this were treated as an adjudication on the merits, to uphold the ruling if there was any evidence to support it, which would be a more favorable standard for the City.Â  We do not believe it would be fair here to sua sponte transform the order in view of the fact that the trial court and both parties have repeatedly treated the motion and ruling in this case as one for a directed verdict as a matter of law.Â  We therefore decline to view the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict in the Cityâ€™s favor as an adjudication on the merits, the circumstances being what they are in this instance, particularly since the trial court gave this defendant exactly what it asked for.Â  Â Â \r\n[2] Â The City repaired the portion of the sidewalk at issue, as well as several adjoining panels, after Ficklingâ€™s fall.Â  In a memo dated June 12, 2001, an inspector from the Cityâ€™s Engineering Division noted many of the adjacent panels of the sidewalk were also broken and the sidewalk had collapsed.Â  The inspector opined large vehicles had been parking on the sidewalk, forming a long rut in the concrete and causing the surrounding damage.Â  The inspector noted the â€œStreets and Sidewalks Division was notified on June 8, 2001 with instructions to inspect and repair.â€ \r\n[3]Â  Fickling did not bring an action against the State.\r\n[4] Â Sauers v.

Bartlett, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4218\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2007 â€“ Filed March 19, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nH. Michael Spivey, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nAndrew G. Goodson, of Fountain Inn, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  The family court ordered Patrick Shorb (Husband) to transfer certain stock options, which were unmatured and nonvested on the date of filing, to Andrea Shorb (Wife).[1]Â  It further ordered Husband to pay Wife a portion of the proceeds from options Husband exercised and sold before the date of filing.Â  Husband appeals the family courtâ€™s decision, claiming Wife was not entitled to the full award because only some of the options were marital property.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on May 10, 1996.Â  They had no children during their seven-year marriage. Â On the date of divorce, Husband was in a managerial position at Wal-Mart, and Wife worked as a private court reporter. Â Wife filed for divorce on October 27, 2003, citing Husbandâ€™s adultery as the ground for divorce.Â  \r\nThe court held a final hearing on November 30, 2004 and approved the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement on December 15, 2004. Â Among other assets, the settlement agreement entitled Wife to fifty-five percent of Husbandâ€™s Wal-Mart stock options. Â The parties agreed the family court would retain jurisdiction to determine what portion of the stock options was marital property.Â  Both parties submitted briefs and affidavits supporting their positions.Â  \r\nOn April 15, 2005, the family court entered a supplemental order relating to the stock options. Â It found that all stock options acquired during marriage, but prior to the filing of divorce, were compensation for Husbandâ€™s employment at Wal-Mart and constituted marital property. \r\nThe court also correctly noted the stock optionsâ€™ vesting dates did not affect whether they were marital property; rather, the vesting dates affected the value of those options. Â In valuing the options Husband sold in July 2003, the family court held that pursuant to the agreement Wife was entitled to fifty-five percent of the net value of the stock options on the date of sale.Â  The family court ordered Husband to transfer $24,099.17 to Wife within thirty days of the order.Â  \r\nThe family court also determined Wife was entitled to fifty-five percent of all stock options held on the date of the final hearing, even though only a certain percentage of those options had fully vested.[2]Â  The family court ordered Husband to transfer 1,096 of the total 2,001 stock options to Wife within thirty days of the order.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 542, 615 S.E.2d 98, 103 (2005).Â  In appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 363, 489 S.E.2d 212, 215 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to\r\ndisregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Nor are we required to disregard the findings below or ignore the better vantage point the family court occupies in determining witness credibility.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  The burden is upon the appellant to convince this Court that the family court erred in its findings of fact.Â  Dubose v. Dubose, 259 S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband first contends the nonvested stock options are non-marital property, which are not subject to equitable distribution.[3]Â  Further, Husband avers that he exercised certain vested stock options prior to the date of filing, which the family court erroneously included as part of the marital estate.Â  Based on these assertions, Husband argues Wife was entitled only to the portion of currently held options that vested and were in existence on the date of filing. Â While we reject the first argument, we accept the latter.\r\nI.&nbsp; Nonvested Stock Options \r\nPursuant to Section 20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006), marital property is â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .â€Â  Section 20-7-473 also includes several exceptions to marital property; however, none of these exceptions explicitly mention vested or nonvested stock options.Â Â  \r\nWe have yet to address in South Carolina whether employee stock options are marital property, subject to equitable distribution.Â  In resolving this issue, we first look to how this State has characterized pension benefits, which are similar to stock options. [4]Â  \r\nLike stock options, the Code does not specifically define pension benefits as marital property, but this Court has consistently held that both vested and nonvested retirement benefits are marital property if the benefits are acquired during the marriage and before the date of filing.Â  See generally Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 99, 463 S.E.2d 321, 322 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œâ€˜Since retirement plans were not excluded by the [Code], retirement plans are therefore includable as marital property subject to division.â€™â€ (quoting Ferguson v. Ferguson, 300 S.C. 1, 386 S.E.2d 267 (Ct. App. 1989))); Hardwick v. Hardwick, 303 S.C. 256, 259-60, 399 S.E.2d 791, 793 (Ct. App. 1990) (finding employerâ€™s contribution to vested retirement fund was a form of additional compensation and constituted marital property); Kneece v. Kneece, 296 S.C. 28, 33, 370 S.E.2d 288, 291 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding husbandâ€™s civil service retirement fund was part of marital estate); see also Ball v. Ball, 312 S.C. 31, 34-35, 430 S.E.2d 533, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding nonvested, unvalued pension benefits are a form of deferred compensation in which a party holds a vested, legally enforceable right so that the benefits are marital property subject to equitable distribution). \r\nMoreover, vested pension benefits are a â€œjoint investment of both partiesâ€ and â€œconstitute an earned property right which, if accrued during the marriage, [are] subject to equitable distribution.â€Â  Tiffault v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 392-93, 401 S.E.2d 157, 158 (1991); see also Hardwick, 303 S.C. at 260, 399 S.E.2d at 793 (If an employer â€œmakes a contribution to a retirement fund as an employment benefit or as a form of additional compensation . . . the contribution is marital property . . . .â€).Â  Even if the vested benefits have yet to mature, they are properly includable in the marital estate.Â  See Kneece, 296 S.C. at 33, 370 S.E.2d at 291.Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe find stock options to be comparable to pension benefits in that they are also employment benefits.Â  Like pension benefits, the determinative factor for equitable distribution purposes is not when the options mature, but when the options are earned.Â  See MacAleer v. MacAleer, 725 A.2d 829, 833 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2001) (â€œThe determining factor is not when the right to exercise the option matures, but whether the stock option is earned prior to the date of separation.â€).Â  Employers may grant options for a variety of reasons, which must be considered in deciding when the option is earned.Â  Most jurisdictions determine the nature of stock options by whether the options are compensation for past services or are an incentive for future services.Â  See, e.g., Hopfer v. Hopfer, 758 A.2d 673, 677 (Conn. App. Ct. 2001) (holding that stock options rendered entirely as incentive for future services are not marital property subject to equitable distribution); MacAleer, 725 A.2d at 835 (finding that employerâ€™s award of stock options to compensate employee for past services is earned when awarded, and if granted during marriage, it is marital property, even if the right to exercise the options matures after the date of filing); In re Balanson, 25 P.3d 28, 32 (Colo. 2001) (holding that stock options granted in consideration for future services do not constitute marital property).\r\nIn considering other jurisdictionsâ€™ approaches, we believe the approach most consistent with this Stateâ€™s equitable apportionment scheme and with the purpose of stock options is to classify both vested and nonvested stock options as being earned when granted, and if granted during the partiesâ€™ marriage, the options are marital property.Â  See Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 158, 591 S.E.2d 654, 660 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œ[C]lassification of property as marital or nonmarital must be determined in light of the true nature and purpose of the benefit.â€).Â  One can argue that stock options serve a hybrid purpose in that they compensate an employee for past labor but also serve as an incentive to remain with the employer.Â  Despite these competing functions, we believe the overriding purpose is to create a form of deferred compensation, which is exercisable at a determinate date in the future.Â  \r\nIn our view, this approach parallels our position on pension benefits and is in accord with several other jurisdictions that have considered this same issue.Â  These jurisdictions treat stock options as marital property regardless of when the right to exercise the options matures as long as the options are granted as compensation for services rendered during the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  See Fountain, 559 S.E.2d at 32 (stating nonvested stock options are a salary substitute or a deferred compensation benefit, and if received during marriage and before filing, the options are marital property, even if they cannot be exercised until after the parties divorce); Jensen v. Jensen, 824 So.2d 315, 319 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2002) (holding nonvested stock options gained prior to filing represent assets accumulated during marriage and are subject to equitable distribution); Fisher v. Fisher, 769 A.2d 1165, 1168 (2001) (finding nonvested stock options are a form of deferred compensation, akin to pension benefits, and if earned by the employee prior to filing, they are marital property). \r\nAccordingly, we hold the family court correctly classified all of the stock options in issue as marital property.Â  Based on the facts, the family court determined the options were compensation for Husbandâ€™s employment.Â  This finding is supported by a memo from Wal-Mart executives, which states that these stock options are an â€œimportant part of [an employeeâ€™s] compensation packageâ€ and serve to encourage employees to create â€œimproved Company results and enhanced Shareholder value.â€Â  As a part of Husbandâ€™s compensation, Wife was entitled to a share of the stock options that Wal-Mart granted to Husband during the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  \r\nWe recognize contingencies exist, such as Husbandâ€™s continued employment, for both parties to receive their share of stock options.Â  This disposition does not force Husband to cash in all the stock options and preemptively pay Wife before the options vest.Â  In clarifying the family courtâ€™s order, we note that Husband is only responsible for delivering the stock options to Wife that have vested by the date of this opinion.Â  \r\nTo date, only seventy-two options have not fully vested.Â  Wifeâ€™s share of these stock options should be transferred to Wife by appropriate order.Â  It is then Wifeâ€™s responsibility to exercise her options before the optionsâ€™ expiration date.Â  If some occurrence prevents Husband from exercising his options, it will likewise affect Wife in the same manner. Â See Ball, 312 S.C. at 35, 430 S.E.2d at 535 (holding that if the husbandâ€™s benefits never vest, the wife is not entitled to receive any of his pension benefits as neither party would suffer disproportionately in relation to the entire marital estate).\r\nII.&nbsp; Vested and Sold Stock Options \r\nHusband next contends the stock options sold in July 2003 were not in existence on the date of filing; therefore, the proceeds from that sale should not have been distributed as part of the marital estate. Â We agree.\r\nFor the family court to properly include property within the marital estate, two factors must coincide.Â  Bowman, 357 S.C. at 155, 591 S.E.2d at 658; see also Â§ 20-7-473.Â  First, the property must be acquired during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  Second, the property must be owned on the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe ownership prong can potentially raise troublesome issues if the family court overlooks assets which should rightly be included in the marital estate, but which are non-existent on the date of filing due to a partyâ€™s misconduct.Â  See, e.g., Bowman, 357 S.C. at 155, 591 S.E.2d at 659; Panhorst v. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 105, 390 S.E.2d 376, 379 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Consequently, if a party attempts to unfairly extinguish ownership of marital property before the date of filing or to improperly delay ownership of marital property until after litigation is commenced, the family court must include that property in the marital estate.Â  To do otherwise would â€œpromote fraud, reward misconduct, and contravene legislative intent.â€Â  Bowman, 357 S.C. at 155, 591 S.E.2d at 659.Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s order confirms that while Husband acquired the stock options during the partiesâ€™ marriage, he did not own the options on the date of filing.Â  Furthermore, while the parties disagree over whether the funds were spent for marital or non-marital purposes, they both agree that the proceeds from the sale of the stock options were disposed of before filing. \r\nProceeds from Husbandâ€™s stock options will be considered marital only if the Wife introduces clear and convincing evidence to establish fraud in relation to Husbandâ€™s sale of the options.Â  See Devlin v. Devlin, 89 S.C. 268, 272, 71 S.E. 966, 968 (1911) (â€œ[F]raud will not be presumed, but [one] who alleges it must prove it.â€); see also Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 219, 621 S.E.2d 368, 375 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œFraud must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.â€).\r\nWifeâ€™s only assertion of fraud is contained in her affidavit when Wife states: â€œWhen [Husband] sold his stock options on July 21, 2003, he did so without my knowledge or consent and [this] was done with the sole intent of depriving me of my rightful marital share.â€Â  Husband, on the other hand, claims that Wife directly received money from the stock optionsâ€™ sale and that Husband paid other debts incurred by Wife with the proceeds from that sale. Â Both partiesâ€™ arguments are tantamount to a swearing match.Â  Because Wife presented no additional corroborating evidence, we cannot presume Husband acted in a fraudulent manner.Â  See Young v. Goodyear Serv. Stores, 244 S.C. 493, 500, 137 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1964) (â€œIt has been many times stated that fraud is not presumed, and that one who charges another with fraud and deceit as a basis of a cause of action must establish such by clear, cogent and convincing evidence.â€).\r\nHusbandâ€™s sale of the July 2003 stock options before the date of filing negates the ownership prong, which is necessary to classify the proceeds from the sale of the options as marital.Â  Further, no clear proof exists that Husband committed fraud when he disposed of the options.Â  As such, we reverse the portion of the family courtâ€™s order that required Husband to pay Wife $24,099.17. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the family court correctly determined the nonvested stock options, granted during the partiesâ€™ marriage and before the date of filing, were marital property.Â  Wife was properly entitled to fifty-five percent of these marital stock options. Â Further, the family court erred in granting Wife fifty-five percent of the proceeds from the stock options sold prior to the date of filing.Â  The family courtâ€™s decision is accordingly \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.[5]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] As a general rule, stock options are vested or nonvested, matured or unmatured, and restricted or unrestricted.Â  See Fountain v. Fountain, 559 S.E.2d 25, 31 (N.C. Ct. App. 2002) (citing Equitable Distribution of Stock Options, 17 Equitable Distribution Journal 85, 86 (Aug. 2000)).Â  An option is vested if the right to exercise the option cannot be cancelled.Â  Id. at 32 n.11.Â  An option is matured, for equitable distribution purposes, if the right to exercise the option exists before the date of filing.Â  Id.Â  Finally, an option is restricted if it cannot be alienated to another party.Â  Id.Â  Because neither party presented any evidence regarding whether the options were restricted, we do not address this aspect of the options in our opinion.Â  \r\n[2] Husband maintains that the date of valuation should have been the date of filing rather than the date of the final hearing.Â  In his brief, Husband asserts scant authority for this proposition, merely stating the date of valuation was both â€œwrongâ€ and â€œunfair.â€Â  Regardless, we find the date of valuation for the options at issue to be immaterial.Â  The family court could not currently value the nonvested options on the date of filing or on the date of the final hearing because the fair market value of Wal-Martâ€™s stock would undoubtedly change before the parties exercised these options.Â  Further, the family court was only to â€œmake a decision as to how [many of the stock options are] marital propertyâ€ as the parties previously â€œagreed that [Wife] is entitled to 55% of the amount the Court determines to be marital property.â€Â  Because the family courtâ€™s only responsibility was to decide which options were marital and then to award Wife her allotted share, the valuation issue has no substantive bearing on the outcome.Â  \r\n[3] Husband lists several additional grounds in his brief for overruling the family court, including: (1) the stock options were never transmuted into marital property; (2) the family court should have reviewed the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement, even though both parties consented to it, as equity and fairness require a different outcome; and (3) the valuation date for the stock options should have been the date of filing rather than the date of the hearing. \r\nHusband fails to sufficiently support his contentions by either case law or the record.Â  More importantly, Husband concedes from the outset in his brief that â€œthe only issue left for appeal . . . at the time his present attorney took over the case was the stock [o]ption issue.â€Â  Husbandâ€™s only argument heading in his brief is â€œDid the Trial Court Err in Determining That Respondent Should Receive 1,096 Shares of Appellantâ€™s Stock Options From Wal-Mart?â€Â  Husbandâ€™s additional arguments must fail as the only issue properly submitted and argued to this Court is the division of the stock options.Â  See Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 99, 594 S.E.2d 485, 496 (Ct. App. 2004) (When â€œan issue is not argued within the body of the brief but is only a short conclusory statement, it is abandoned on appeal.â€); see also Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (A â€œbrief shall be divided into as many parts as there are issues to be argued. At the head of each part, the particular issue to be addressed shall be set forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations of authority.â€). \r\n[4] According to the article, Equitable Distribution of Stock Options, supra note 1, at 87, â€œMost states treat stock options, vested and nonvested, â€˜in a manner analogous to the treatmentâ€™ of retirement benefits.â€ (cited with approval in Fountain, 559 S.E.2d at 32 n.12).Â Â  \r\n[5] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4219","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Renauld L.

Brown, of Spartanburg, Pro Se Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Â Â The State appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding the State had not shown probable cause to believe Renauld L. Brown is a sexually violent predator.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAt approximately 6:00 a.m., on September 10, 2000, Renauld L. Brown was caught peeping in the windows of a thirty-six year old womanâ€™s home.Â  In November of that year, Brown was indicted on one count of eavesdropping/peeping tom for the incident.Â  Thereafter, Brown was seen looking into the same victimâ€™s windows on January 13, 2001 at approximately 3:00 a.m., and again on April 10, 2001 at 4:00 a.m. Â On October 10, 2001, Brown was convicted of one count of stalking and two counts of entering premises after notice in connection with the 2000 and two 2001 incidents.Â  He was sentenced to thirty days with credit for time served.Â  \r\nOn the evening of October 12, 2001, two days after being released from jail, Brown was seen peeping into the windows of the same womanâ€™s abode.Â  While his victim was on the telephone calling police, Brown attempted to break down her back door.Â  He was subsequently apprehended and charged with voyeurism, stalking, and attempted burglary.Â  On December 19, 2002, Brown was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to three years suspended to 433 days (time served) for voyeurism, one year for stalking, and five years suspended to 433 days (time served) for attempted burglary.\r\nOn January 13, 2003, twenty-five days after being released from jail on the December 2002 convictions, Brown was seen shortly before midnight peeping into the windows of a house belonging to the sister of the victim of his earlier offenses.Â  When police arrived, Brown attempted to flee but was captured after a brief foot chase.Â  After he was arrested and placed in the patrol car, Brown kicked one of the officers and began kicking the vehicleâ€™s doors.Â  He was charged with eavesdropping/peeping tom and resisting arrest. \r\nOn January 7, 2005, Brown pled guilty to voyeurism and was sentenced to three years suspended to thirty months and three years probation, with credit for time served.Â  The sentencing judge made a specific finding that the offense should be considered a sexually violent act under the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act (S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to 44-48-170 (Supp. 2006)).Â  \r\nBrown arrived at the South Carolina Department of Corrections on January 10, 2005, and was released on probation on January 11, 2005.Â  On June 4, 2005, less than six months after being released on probation, Brown was seen looking into the windows of yet another home.Â  The house belonged to a twenty-eight year old female, unrelated to his prior victims.Â  Brown pled guilty to one count of eavesdropping/peeping tom on June 29, 2005, and was sentenced to eighteen months incarceration, with the special condition that he receive mental health counseling.Â  \r\nPursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act, and particularly in light of the fact he had a previous qualifying offense, prior to Brownâ€™s release from the Department of Corrections, the multidisciplinary committee reviewed his case.Â  On October 24, 2005, the committee found probable cause to believe Brown to be a sexually violent predator.Â  On November 22, 2005, the prosecutorâ€™s review committee also found probable cause to believe Brown is a sexually violent predator and referred the case for further proceedings under the Act.Â  \r\nOn December 2, 2005, the State commenced an action seeking to commit Brown for long term control, care, and treatment.Â  The circuit judge found the Stateâ€™s petition set forth sufficient probable cause to believe Brown to be a sexually violent predator and ordered his detention pending a probable cause hearing.Â  \r\nThe matter was called for a probable cause hearing in the circuit court on February 15, 2006.Â  Brown was present with counsel.Â  The state argued Brownâ€™s history indicated he has a mental abnormality that causes him serious difficulty in controlling his deviant behavior.Â  The State further averred Brownâ€™s lack of sex offender treatment of any kind make him a significant risk to re-offend if not confined for long-term control, care and treatment.Â  In light of the evidence indicating Brownâ€™s inability to control his behavior and his significant risk to re-offend, the State asked the circuit court to find probable cause and order that Brown be evaluated by a qualified expert pursuant to the Code. \r\nBrown argued that even though his conduct was against the law, he had not committed an act of violence, and therefore, the State could not show probable cause that he would commit future acts of sexual violence. \r\n\r\nDuring the proceeding, the circuit court stated: \r\n  \r\n[I]tâ€™s not like heâ€™s [Brown] just oblivious to the fact that [his offenses] ought to be considered some sort of deviant behavior.\r\n    \r\n. . .\r\n    \r\nHe ought to have sense enough to know he needs counseling based upon his prior behavior.Â  And if he had that treatment or that counseling at his request, it might be that the state wouldnâ€™t even be here with this petition today, you see.\r\nThatâ€™s one concern they have, is that heâ€™s not received any treatment for his obvious misbehavior and itâ€™s likely that itâ€™s needed, and thatâ€™s likely to be true.Â  And therefore I say he ought to understand that just based on his prior behavior and his difficulties.Â  Thatâ€™s got nothing to do with probable cause.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court dismissed the action, finding the State had not established probable cause to believe Brown is a sexually violent predator.Â  The entire substantive body of the judgeâ€™s order read:\r\n\r\nThis matter came before this Court for hearing on the petition of the petitioner, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 44-48-80, for the Court to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the respondent is a sexually violent predator as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Section 44-48-30.Â  After a consideration of the showing made this Court finds that the Attorney General has failed to establish the existence of probable cause to believe that the respondent is a sexually violent predator and therefore the petition is dismissed with prejudice.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn review, the appellate court will not disturb the hearing countâ€™s finding on probable cause unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the hearing courtâ€™s finding.â€Â  In re Care and Treatment of Tucker, 353 S.C. 466, 470, 578 S.E.2d 719, 721 (2003); see also In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 131, 568 S.E.2d 338, 342 (2002) (citing Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976)) (on appeal of a non-jury law case, the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidentiary support).Â  In an appeal regarding sufficiency of the evidence in a sexually violent predator case, we may only reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  In re Care and Treatment of Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 59, 584 S.E.2d 893, 896 (2003) (citing In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 646, 550 S.E.2d 311, 315 (2001)). Â In other words, this court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s Sexually Violent Predator Act (â€œSVP Actâ€ or â€œActâ€), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to 44-48-170 (Supp. 2006), provides for the involuntary civil commitment of sexually violent predators who are â€œmentally abnormal and extremely dangerous.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp. 2006).Â  The Act is not intended to be punitive in nature.Â  The quiddity of the act is to: (1) meet the special needs of sexually violent predators; (2) address the significant likelihood they will engage in repeated acts of sexual violence if not treated for their mental conditions; and (3) assess the risks requiring their involuntary civil commitment in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp. 2006). Â Noting â€œthe nature of the mental conditions from which sexually violent predators suffer and the dangers they present,â€ our General Assembly found â€œit is necessary to house involuntary committed sexually violent predators in secure facilities separated from persons involuntarily committed under traditional civil commitment statutes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp. 2006).\r\nThe SVP Act defines a â€œsexually violent predatorâ€ as a person who: â€œ(a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30 (1) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\nCommitment of someone under the SVP Act typically begins when a person convicted of a sexually violent offense is scheduled to be released from custody.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 44-48-40(A) (Supp. 2006).Â  When a person has been imprisoned for a sexually violent offense, law requires that the agency with jurisdiction over that person give notice to both the Attorney General and a multidisciplinary team specially designed to evaluate the particular offender.Â  Id.Â  Typically, such notice must be provided in writing at least one hundred eighty days prior to the personâ€™s release.Â  See Â§ 44-48-40(A)(1) (Supp. 2006). \r\nThe multidisciplinary team must consist of: â€œ(1) a representative from the Department of Corrections; (2) a representative from the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services; (3) a representative from the Department of Mental Health who is a trained, qualified mental health clinician with expertise in treating sexually violent offenders; (4) a retired judge appointed by the Chief Justice who is eligible for continued judicial service pursuant to Section 2-19-100; and (5) an attorney with substantial experience in the practice of criminal defense law to be appointed by the Chief Justice to serve a term of one year.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50 (Supp. 2006).Â  This team reviews the personâ€™s records to determine if he or she satisfies the definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  Id.Â  If the multidisciplinary team determines that the person meets the definition, the body forwards its assessment and all relevant records to a prosecutorâ€™s review committee.Â  Id.\r\nThe prosecutorâ€™s review committee then â€œdetermine[s] whether or not probable cause exists to believe the person is a sexually violent predator.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-60 (Supp. 2006).Â  In additional to the records and reports provided by the multidisciplinary team, the committee must consider any information provided by the circuit solicitor who originally prosecuted the person.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIf the prosecutorâ€™s review committee finds probable cause exists to believe the person is sexually violent predator, the Attorney General must file a petition asking the court to make a probable cause determination.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the prosecutor's review committee has determined that probable cause exists to support the allegation that the person is a sexually violent predator, the Attorney General must file a petition with the court in the jurisdiction where the person committed the offense and must notify the victim that the committee found that probable cause exists. The Attorney General must also notify the victim of the time, date, and location of the probable cause hearing before the court. The petition, which must be filed within thirty days of the probable cause determination by the prosecutor's review committee, must request that the court make a probable cause determination as to whether the person is a sexually violent predator. The petition must allege that the person is a sexually violent predator and must state sufficient facts that would support a probable cause allegation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-70 (Supp. 2006).\r\nÂ â€œUpon filing of a petition, the court must determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually violent predator.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(A) (Supp. 2006).Â  The probable cause hearing is required within seventy-two hours after the person is taken into custody.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  At the hearing, the law instructs the court to:Â  â€œ(1) verify the detaineeâ€™s identity; (2) receive evidence and hear arguments from the person and the Attorney General; and (3) determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the person is a sexually violent predator.â€Â  Id.Â  The suspected predator is guaranteed: â€œ(1) to be represented by counsel; (2) to present evidence on the personâ€™s behalf; (3) to cross-examine witnesses who testify against the person; and (4) to view and copy all petitions and reports in the court file.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\nâ€œIf the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the person is a sexually violent predator, the person must be taken into custody if he is not already confined in a secure facility,â€ in order to await his or her commitment trial to be held.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(A) (Supp. 2006).Â  This trial will be heard by a judge unless the detainee or Attorney General requests a jury trial.Â  The State has the burden to prove the person is a sexually violent predator beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  In the Matter of the Care and Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 60, 584 S.E.2d 893, 896 (2003); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100 (Supp. 2006).\r\nThe undisputed evidence presented to the circuit court at Brownâ€™s probable cause hearing established a clear pattern of sexually deviant behavior.Â  Luculently, the existence of probable cause to believe he was a sexually violent person was validated.\r\nâ€œProbable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard.â€ State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 220, 600 S.E.2d 112, 117 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 103 S. Ct. 1535, 75 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1983)).Â  The very term itself, â€œprobable cause,â€ does not import absolute certainty. State v. Bennett, 256 S.C. 234, 182 S.E.2d 291 (1971); State v. Arnold, 319 S.C. 256, 460 S.E.2d 403 (Ct. App. 1995). Â \r\nIn looking at probable cause determining whether a search warrant should be issued, this court has stated that magistrates are to concern themselves with probabilities and not certainties. Â State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 251, 609 S.E.2d 572, 587 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Bowie, 360 S.C. at 220, 600 S.E.2d at 117.)Â  In regard to the lawfulness of an arrest, probable cause â€œmerely requires that the facts available to the officer would â€˜warrant a man of reasonable caution in the beliefâ€™ â€ that an offense has been committed and that the accused committed it. Â Brown, 460 U.S. at 742, 103 S. Ct. 1535 (quoting Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925)). Â Probable cause may be found somewhere between suspicion and sufficient evidence to convict.Â  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 250, 525 S.E.2d 535, 540-41 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Thompson v. Smith, 289 S.C. 334, 336-37, 345 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 1986), overruled in part on other grounds by Jones v. City of Columbia, 301 S.C. 62, 389 S.E.2d 662 (1990)).\r\nIn the context of probable cause to believe someone to be a sexually violent predator, probable cause requires that the evidence presented would lead a reasonable person to believe and conscientiously entertain suspicion that the person meets the definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  See People v. Hardacre, 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 667, 673 (Cal. App. 2 Dist. 2001); see also Matter of Hay, 953 P.2d 666, 676 (Kan. 1998) (a probable cause determination in a sexual predator case requires evidence sufficient for a person of ordinary prudence and action to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief that the person in question is a sexually violent predator).Â  Probable cause â€œdoes not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.â€ Â Brown, 460 U.S. at 742, 103 S. Ct. 1535.Â  \r\nIn a seven-month span in 2000 and 2001, Brown was discovered peeping into the same victimâ€™s windows on three separate occasions, the latter two incidents occurring after he had already been indicted for the first.Â  Only two days after completing his first sentence, Brown was apprehended for recommitting his previous offense, this time attempting to break down the womanâ€™s door.Â  He was imprisoned and shortly after being released from confinement was caught peeping in windows at the home of the previous victimâ€™s sister.Â  During this arrest, Brown behaved violently.Â  He resisted capture and kicked a police officer in the process.Â  After being incarcerated for approximately two years for this offense, Brown was yet again found looking into someoneâ€™s home.\r\nThis chronology demonstrates a disturbing pattern, no sign of rehabilitation or remorse, and shows increasingly violent aspects of deviant behavior.Â  A personâ€™s dangerous propensities to commit future acts of sexual violence are the focus of the SVP Act.Â  See In re Care and Treatment of Corely, 353 S.C. 202, 207, 577 S.E.2d 451, 454 (2003).Â  There is brobdingnagian evidence in the record indicating Brown suffers from voyeurism, a condition that involves recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors involving the act of watching an unsuspecting person who is naked or in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity.Â  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (â€œDSM-IVâ€), 532 (4th ed. 1994).Â  There is plenitudinous evidence to support a reasonable belief and suspicion that Brown meets the definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  Brown: (1) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (2) most probably suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.\r\nThat Brown was not violent, per se, toward any of his victims is of no consequence.Â  The Codeâ€™s definition of â€œsexually violent offenseâ€ lists fifteen specific criminal sexual offenses, as well as â€œany offense for which the judge makes a specific finding on the record that based on the circumstances of the case, the personâ€™s offense should be considered a sexually violent offense.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(2) (Supp 2006).Â  Many of the listed offenses do not require an overt act of violence.Â  Section 44-48-30(2) includes the crimes of incest, buggery, committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child under the age of sixteen, and accessory before the fact to commit any of the other offenses enumerated in the section.Â  Such offenses can unequivocally be accomplished without aggression, the use of great force, or having serious physical harm or injury result. Â It is apodictic that in order to qualify as a sexually violent offense, oneâ€™s actions do not have be violent in the sense of being physically injurious or destructive.\r\nThe determination was made by the sentencing judge that, under these particular facts and circumstances, Brownâ€™s eavesdropping/peeping tom amounted to a sexually violent offense.Â  The facts and circumstances necessary to qualify his offense as a sexually violent one are indubitably present.Â  Brownâ€™s intrusion violated the sanctity of these victimâ€™s homes.Â  His actions were unquestionably gravely injurious to the psyche and emotional well-being of these women.Â  Furthermore, the repetitious nature of his behavior conforms to the definition of a predator.Â  â€œPredatoryâ€ is defined as â€œshowing a disposition to injure or exploit others for oneâ€™s own gain.â€Â  Websterâ€™s New Collegiate Dictionary 898 (1979).\r\nAdditionally, Brown committed acts of violence.Â  Â In connection with two of his voyeurism incidents, he attempted to break down one victimâ€™s door, resisted arrest, and kicked a law enforcement official.Â  Such behavior indicates that Brownâ€™s urges transcend the act of passively watching women through their windows at night.\r\nA cursory reading of the transcript reveals the circuit court believed there was sufficient evidence to suggest Brown suffers from sexually deviant urges and needs therapy and psychiatric care.Â  The court stated that Brown should â€œknow he needs counseling based upon his prior behavior,â€ and that the Stateâ€™s contention that Brown needed sex offender treatment was â€œlikely to be true.â€Â  Yet incredibly, the circuit court stated Brownâ€™s need for treatment â€œbased upon his prior behavior and his difficultiesâ€ had â€œnothing to do with probable cause.â€Â  In contrariety, the need for treatment to prevent repeat offenses is the central focus of the SVP Act, and thus is directly relevant to such probable cause determinations.Â  In the face of those statements on the record, however, the circuit court inexplicably found no probable cause and dismissed the case.\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s finding of no probable cause is not supported by the evidence.Â  It is in contraposition to the record as well as the courtâ€™s stated recognition that Brown has deviant urges and needs treatment.Â  If the circuit courtâ€™s order is given viability, Brown will not be evaluated to determine the extent of his obvious sexually deviant urges and what treatment he needs to control them.Â  Rather, he will remain free to terrorize other unsuspecting females, and will not receive the treatment he requires.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe hold that the trial record irrefutably establishes probable cause within the mandate of the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act.Â  We come to the adamantine and inescapable conclusion that the evidentiary record dictates REVERSAL. \r\nThis case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings in accordance with the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act, including a psychiatric evaluation and a trial on the merits. \r\nACCORDINGLY, THE ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT JUDGE IS \r\nREVERSED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4220","title":"Jamison v.

and (2) denial of Jamisonâ€™s motions for sanctions and relief from judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn July 1998, Virnell Isaac suffered major injuries to her liver when the 1993 Escort she was driving was involved in a frontal, angular collision with another car.Â  Isaac died several days later as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident.Â Â Â  \r\nJamison filed a wrongful death action against Ford Motor Company (Ford) alleging, in relevant part, that Isaac suffered fatal injuries because Ford negligently designed and implemented the driverâ€™s occupant protection system.[2]Â  Ford equipped the 1993 Escort with a driverâ€™s side passive restraint system employing various components that worked collectively to protect the driver in frontal, angular collisions.Â  The passive restraint system components included: (1) an automatic, motorized shoulder belt that positioned itself over the occupant without any action by the occupant; (2) a seat pan; (3) a knee bolster; and (4) an energy absorbing car body.Â  The restraint system required no affirmative action by the driver, making it completely passive and in compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208.Â  The 1993 Escort was additionally equipped with a manual lap belt that required affirmative action from the passenger or driver to engage it.Â  Jamison specifically complained that Ford negligently designed and implemented the various components of the restraint system, including the manual lap belt, the knee bolster, and the seat pan.Â  \r\nDuring discovery Jamison requested crash test reports and full videos of 1991 through 1993 Ford Escort crash tests.Â  Ford responded by producing a summary of certification tests, but referred Jamison to Mazda, the company that conducted the requested crash tests, for the detailed reports and actual videos.Â  Ford provided 1994 through 1996 Ford Escort crash test reports and videos.Â  However, the 1994 through 1996 models, unlike the 1991 through 1993 models, were equipped with driver and passenger side airbag restraint systems.Â  \r\nIn October 2003, Jamison filed a â€œMotion to Compel Production of Documents.â€Â  Jamison asked the court to order Fordâ€™s production of the 1991 through 1993 test reports and videos.Â  Additionally, Jamison urged that Ford be required to provide complete video tests, noting that the videos Ford had produced were â€œmissing significant portions of the crash tests.â€ Â Jamison sought sanctions against Ford for discovery abuses, claiming Ford had intentionally delayed discovery by submitting duplicative and non-responsive documents.Â  The circuit court agreed Ford must supply the materials requested; however, the court refrained from imposing sanctions due to Fordâ€™s representation that the documents would be delivered.Â  Ford subsequently surrendered a â€œsmall group of Mazda crash testsâ€ and certified that all materials from Mazda regarding the crash tests had been yielded.Â  \r\nFord filed motions in limine to exclude certain theories of liability Jamison asserted.Â  Specifically, Ford contended (1) Jamison was preempted by Federal law from arguing Fordâ€™s choice of the passive restraint system installed in the Escort was defective, i.e. that another type of restraint system would have prevented Isaacâ€™s injuries; (2) Jamison was preempted from challenging the geometry of the manual lap belt design; and (3) Jamisonâ€™s claim that the manual lap belt design was defective should be excluded because no reasonable evidence existed to indicate Isaac wore the manual lap belt and that its defective design proximately caused her injuries. \r\nThe circuit court ruled: (1) federal regulations preempted Jamison from challenging Fordâ€™s choice of restraint system; (2) testimony suggesting a manual lap belt should have been a component of the 1993 Escortâ€™s passive restraint system was excluded because such evidence challenged Fordâ€™s choice of restraint system; andÂ  (3) Jamison was allowed to present evidence that the design of the passive restraint system was defective; however, anyÂ  testimony that the passive restraint system was defective without a manual lap belt was preempted.\r\nIn January 2004, Jamison filed a motion for sanctions against Ford for alleged ongoing discovery abuse.Â  Jamison argued a default judgment should be entered against Ford for willful and intentional failure to produce certain crash test data that Jamison received on January 19, 2004 from another source.[3] Â The circuit court declined to enter a default judgment without having an opportunity to review the evidence and determine its prejudicial effect.Â  \r\nImmediately prior to trial, the circuit court again considered various pending motions, including Jamisonâ€™s motion for default judgment.Â  At that time, Jamison informed the circuit court that additional videotapes of crash tests showing more views of occupant kinematics in the 1993 Escort had been discovered.Â  Jamison urged the court to sanction Ford by prohibiting references to the 1993 Escortâ€™s compliance with federal regulations.Â  The circuit court held Jamison failed to demonstrate Fordâ€™s conduct warranted such sanctions, and the motion was denied. \r\nDuring the pre-trial hearing, the circuit court revisited the issue of Jamisonâ€™s defective lap belt claim.Â  The circuit court held â€œ[t]he lap belt . . . argument is preempted,â€ and Jamison cannot â€œcriticize the lap belt.â€Â  However, the court held that â€œthe effectiveness of [the passive restraint] system, what it was designed and intended to do is subject to challenge . . . .â€Â  The court confirmed that, in order to prove negligence based on any defective restraint system, Jamison must prove proximate cause.Â  \r\nThe case was tried before a jury in February 2004.Â  Jamison attempted to introduce a crash test video conducted on a 1995 vehicle that was identical to Isaacâ€™s 1993 Escort, except the 1995 vehicle was equipped with air bags.Â  Jamison submitted that the tests demonstrated occupant kinematics.Â  Ford objected to the tests based on the prejudicial effect of the air bag.Â  The circuit court excluded the video under Rule 403, SCRE, concluding the probative value of the video was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and potential to mislead the jury.Â  The jury returned a verdict in Fordâ€™s favor.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Jamison received a brochure advertising a 1993 European Escort.Â  Jamison filed a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment arguing the newly discovered evidence demonstrated the feasibility of an alternative design and further substantiated claims of Fordâ€™s discovery abuse.Â  The circuit court found the brochure was cumulative and Jamison was not prejudiced by non-disclosure of the brochure.Â  Jamisonâ€™s motion for relief from judgment was denied\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Expert Testimony \r\nJamison argues the circuit court erred in excluding expert testimony relating to the geometry and design of the manual lap belt Ford had installed in the 1993 Escort.Â  Specifically, Jamison maintains the circuit court erred as a matter of law in relying on its interpretation of Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 529 U.S. 861 (2000), that any challenge to the passive restraint system based upon the alleged defective manual lap belt was preempted.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFord contends this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  The failure to make a proffer of excluded evidence will preclude review on appeal.Â  State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 46, 599 S.E.2d 448, 454 (2004); TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998). Â Generally, a party must request the opportunity to present an expert witness in order for the issue to be preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 51-52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  It is well settled that a reviewing court may not consider error claimed in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the rejected testimony would have been.Â  State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 20, 260 S.E.2d 705, 708 (1979).Â  However, this rule regarding proffers has been relaxed where the appellate court is able determine from the record what the testimony was intended to show and that prejudice clearly exists.Â  State v. Jenkins, 322 S.C. 360, 367, 474 S.E.2d 812, 816 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nIn this case, the record sufficiently identifies the testimony Jamison sought to introduce regarding the use of and alleged defects of the manual lap belt.Â  Furthermore, as Jamison averred, the exclusion of expert testimony regarding the manual lap belt prevented Jamison from being able to â€œproperly criticize the seatbelt design or to explain the full geometry of the defects in the belt system.â€Â  Initially, Jamisonâ€™s â€œprimary criticism [was] aimed at lower torso restraint in this configuration, or lack thereof.â€Â  The improper exclusion of the manual lap belt evidence would indubitably prejudice Jamison.Â  Therefore, this issue is preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\nOn the merits, the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony is a matter within the circuit courtâ€™s sound discretion. Â Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005); State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 626 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Harris, 318 S.C. 178, 456 S.E.2d 433 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to admit expert testimony will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 51, 596 S.E.2d 488, 494 (2004); Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002); State v. Grubbs, 353 S.C. 374, 577 S.E.2d 493 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 495 S.E.2d 463 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œAn\r\nabuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Douglas, 367 S.C. at 507, 626 S.E.2d at 64.Â  Â \r\nTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice. Â Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 374 (2005); Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509; Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004). Â To show prejudice, there must be a reasonable probability that the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.\r\nA.&nbsp; Federal Preemption Under National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966,\r\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, the â€œSaving Clause,â€ and Geier v. American Honda Motor Company \r\nA priori, the initial issue in the case sub judice is whether by express federal preemption this state common law tort action is barred.Â  Briefly, we review the federal preemption principles explicated in King v. Ford Motor Co., 209 F.3d 886, 891 (2000).\r\n\r\nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that federal law â€œshall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of and State to the Contrary notwithstanding.â€ Â U.S. Const. art. VI. Thus, as has been clear since the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Mâ€™Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.), 316, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819), any state law that conflicts with federal law is â€œwithout effect.â€ Â Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (citing Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746, 101 S. Ct. 2114, 68 L.Ed.2d 576 (1981)).\r\nIn applying the Supremacy Clause, courts â€œstart with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by [a] Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.â€ Â Medtronic v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (citing Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S. Ct. 1146, 91 L. Ed. 1447 (1947)). Â Therefore, â€œ â€˜[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstoneâ€™ in every pre-emption case.â€Â  Id. (citing Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 516, 112 S. Ct. 2608). Â The Supreme Court has stated that Congress may make its intent to preempt clear either expressly or implicitly. Â See Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S. Ct. 1483, 131 L. Ed.2d 385 (1995). Â Implied preemption, in turn, takes two forms. Â â€œWe have found implied conflict pre-emption where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements, or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.â€ Â Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted). Â In summary, then, there are three types of preemption-express preemption, implied conflict preemption, and implied field preemption.[4]\r\n\r\nThe cognoscenti of federal preemption jurisprudence bestow panoramic application so as to limit state common law tort actions.Â  We decline to accept this broad-brush federal judicial barricade.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act) (80 Stat. 718, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1381 et seq. (1988 ed.)\r\nThe express preemption provision contained in section 1392(d) of the Safety Act reads:\r\n\r\nWhenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard established under this subchapter is in effect, no State or political subdivision of a State shall have any authority either to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect to any motor vehicle or item or motor vehicle equipment any safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of equipment which is not identical to the Federal standard.Â  \r\n\r\n15 U.S.C. Â§ 1392(d) (1988 ed.).\r\n2.&nbsp; Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 \r\n&nbsp;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208, promulgated under the authority of the Safety Act, specifies performance requirements for the protection of vehicle occupants in crashes.Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 571.208 (2006).Â  FMVSS 208 establishes the various restraint systems manufacturers must install to comply with federal regulations; the requirements differ depending on the year the car was manufactured.Â  Id.Â  The version of FMVSS 208 in effect when the 1993 Escort was produced required automobile makers to certify passenger cars with a completely passive restraint system:\r\n\r\nS4.1.2.1 First optionâ€”frontal/angular automatic protection system.Â  The vehicle shall:\r\n  \r\n(a) At each front outboard designated seating position meet the frontal crash protection requirements of S5.1 buy means that requires no action by vehicle occupants.\r\n  \r\n\r\n49 C.F.R. Â§ 571.208 (1992 ed.).\r\nManufacturers had the option of certifying passenger cars with either an automatic seat belt or an airbag.Â  The Department of Transportation permitted manufacturers to meet the automatic seat belt option requirement using belts that provided only upper torso restraint:[5]\r\n\r\nS4.5.3Â  Automatic belts:Â  Except as provided in S4.5.3.1, a seat belt assembly that requires no action by vehicle occupants (hereinafter referred to as an â€œautomatic beltâ€) may be used to meet the crash protection requirements of any option under S4 and in place of any seat belt assembly otherwise required by that option.Â  \r\nS4.5.3.2Â  An automatic belt, furnished pursuant to S4.5.3, that provides both pelvic and upper torso restraint may have either a detachable or nondetachable upper torso portion, notwithstanding provisions of the option under which it is furnished.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nFMVSS 208 was viewed:\r\nnot as a minimum standard, but as a way to provide a manufacturer with a range of choices among different passive restraint systems that would be gradually introduced, thereby lowering costs, overcoming technical safety problems, encouraging technological development, and winning widespread consumer acceptableâ€”all of which would promote FMVSS 208â€™s safety objectives.\r\n\r\nGeier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 529 U.S. 861, 862 (2000).Â  \r\n 3.&nbsp; The Saving Clause\r\nRegulation FMVSS 208, together with the Safety Actâ€™s express preemption provision, precludes States from setting safety standards that are not identical to the federal standard set forth in FMVSS 208.Â  However, Section 1397(k) of the Safety Act establishes that â€œ[c]ompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.â€Â  See Â Geier, 529 U.S. at 895.Â  The presence of this saving clause â€œrequires that the pre-emption provision be read narrowly to pre-empt only state statutes and regulations.â€ Id. at 861.Â  The majority in Geier observed that: \r\n\r\n[w]ithout a saving clause, a broad reading of the express pre-emption provision arguably might pre-empt those actions . . . as applying to standards imposed in common-law tort actions, as well as standards contained in state legislation or regulations.Â  And if so, it would pre-empt all nonidentical state standards established in tort actions covering the same aspect of performance as an applicable federal standard, even if the federal standard merely established a minimum standard.Â  On that broad reading of the pre-emption clause little, if any, potential â€œliability at common lawâ€ would remain. . . .Â  We have found no convincing indication that Congress wanted to pre-empt, not only state statutes and regulations, but also common-law tort actions, in such circumstances. \r\n\r\nGeier, 529 U.S.C. at 868.\r\nImportantly, scholars on basic conflict preemption principles inculcate in regard to the fundamental elixir of the rule when juxtaposing federal/state constitutional analysis.Â  If a state statute, administrative rule, or common law cause of action conflicts with a federal statute, it is incontestable that the state law has no efficacy.Â  It is pellucid that the Supremacy Clause does not bless unelected federal judges with carte blanche to utilize federal law as a conduit to impose their own views of tort law on the States.Â  Assumptively, we recognize that common law tort actions are historically within the scope of the Statesâ€™ police powers and are safe from preemption by a federal statute unless Congress reveals a clear and manifest purpose to preempt.Â  \r\n4.&nbsp; Geier v. American Honda Motor Company \r\nThe Geier court reasoned that the saving clause â€œat leastâ€ removed common law tort actions from the scope of the express preemption clause, but neither the saving clause nor the express preemption provision barred the ordinary working of conflict preemption principles.Â  Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 529 U.S. 861, 869 (2000).Â  The majority cautioned that â€œ[n]othing in the language of the saving clause suggests an intent to save state-law tort actions that conflict with federal regulations.â€Â  Id.Â \r\nIn Geier, a young man suffered injuries while driving a 1987 Honda Accord equipped with manual shoulder and lap belts but no driverâ€™s side airbag.Â  529 U.S. at 865.Â  Under FMVSS 208, Honda had the choice of whether or not to equip the 1987 Accord with an airbag.Â  Id.Â  Applying conflict preemption principles, the supreme court held plaintiffsâ€™ contention that the Accord should have been equipped with an airbag was preempted because the argument â€œstood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the important . . . federal objectives [to promote safety by allowing manufacturers to install alternative protection systems].â€ Â 529 U.S. at 881 (internal citations and quotations omitted).Â  Thus, under Geier, a manufacturerâ€™s choice of restraint system cannot be challenged if it complies with the requirements under FMVSS 208.Â  Â \r\nPlaintiffs are not preempted from asserting a defect in the design or implementation of a chosen passive restraint system.Â  See King v. Ford Motor Co., 209 F.3d 886, 892 (2000). Â The King court emphasized that â€œcompliance with performance criteria does not immunize manufacturers from common law liability arising from any defects in the production or design of their passive restraint systems.â€Â  Id. (internal citations omitted) Â (â€œ[T]he very federal safety statute upon which GM relies makes it abundantly clear that compliance with the regulations promulgated thereunder does not immunize a manufacturer from common law liability.â€ (citing 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1397(c) (1976))).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Isaac sustained her injuries in a frontal, angular collision.Â  Pursuant to FMVSS 208, the 1993 Escort had to â€œmeet the frontal crash protection requirements [established by FMVSS 208] by means that require no action by vehicle occupants.â€Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 571.208 (1992 ed.) (emphasis added).Â  Ford was required to provide a passive restraint system that secures passengers without the use of any manual elements.Â  Ford chose to equip the 1993 Escort with a driverâ€™s side passive restraint system employing various components that worked collectively to protect the driver and complied with FMVSS 208. Â The components included: (1) an automatic, motorized shoulder belt; (2) a seat pan; (3) a knee bolster; and (4) an energy absorbing car body. \r\nBased on the Safety Act, FMVSS 208, the saving clause, and Geier, Jamison was preempted from claiming the manual lap belt was defective in geometry or design.Â  Notably a lap belt was not part of the passive restraint system chosen by Ford or required by the FMVSS; Ford included the manual lap belt in compliance with other federal regulations to protect occupants against lateral crashes and rollovers.Â  As Jamisonâ€™s trial counsel acknowledged in a pre-trial hearing: â€œ[I]tâ€™s not going to make any difference. . . whether you have a lap belt on or not because Ford depends on [other components] to restrain the lower torsoâ€ in collisions like the one in this case.Â  Thus, allowing Jamison to challenge the geometry or design of the manual lap belt would be tantamount to allowing Jamison to argue Ford should have included a lap belt that effectively restrains the torso.Â  Such an argument clearly challenges Fordâ€™s choice of occupant restraint systems and is preempted by Geier.Â  The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Jamisonâ€™s expert testimony regarding the manual lap belt.Â  Moreover, the circuit court appropriately advised the jury about the irrelevance of the lap belt in the following instruction:\r\n\r\n[I]n this particular dispute . . . the use, design or performance of a lap belt is not in question.Â  It is not an issue and itâ€™s not to be considered by you in this.Â  You will see it and observe it [in various exhibits] but it has no significance in this dispute for your purposes or your consideration.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Jamison suggests the jury was left to wonder about the role the lap belt played, or would have played, in protecting Isaac.Â  Nevertheless, we determine the circuit courtâ€™s instruction sufficiently informed the jury that the lap belt was not to be considered.Â Â  \r\n B. Proximate Cause\r\nAs an additional basis for exclusion of evidence regarding Jamisonâ€™s defective lap belt claim, Ford contends Jamison failed to establish any reliable proof that a lap belt design defect proximately caused Isaacâ€™s fatal injuries. Â Proximate cause requires proof of causation in fact and legal cause. Â Bray v. Marathon Corp., 356 S.C. 111, 116-17, 588 S.E.2d 93, 95 (2003); Trivelas v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 463, 494 S.E.2d 835, 842 (Ct. App. 1997). Â Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  Bray, 356 S.C. at 117, 588 S.E.2d at 95; Small, 329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d at 842.Â  The touchstone of proximate cause in South Carolina is foreseeability.Â  Koester v. Carolina Rental Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 443 S.E.2d 392 (1994); Small, 329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d at 842.\r\nFord advanced its contention that, because no reliable proof existed showing Isaac was wearing the lap belt in the 1993 Escort, any alleged defect in the lap belt design could not have proximately caused Isaacâ€™s injuries.Â  Luculently, without evidence Isaac wore the lap belt, Jamisonâ€™s defective lap belt claim even fails the â€˜but forâ€™ test for causation.Â  However, the circuit courtâ€™s exclusion of any evidence concerning a lap belt design defect was more clearly based on a preemption analysis under Geier, rather than on an analysis of proximate cause. Â \r\nNotwithstanding the circuit courtâ€™s rationale, this court is authorized to consider any sustaining ground pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€) and Iâ€˜On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (â€œThe appellate court may review respondentâ€™s additional reasons and, if convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm the lower courtâ€™s judgment.â€).Â  Accordingly, we hereby encapsulate the entire reasoning and rationale in regard to proximate cause as an additional sustaining ground if perchance there is any issue as to the preservation of Fordâ€™s proximate cause argument.\r\nII. Crash Tests\r\nThe circuit court excluded video crash tests of a 1995 Escort that Jamison purported were substantially similar to the collision in this case and should have been admitted.Â  Jamison complains the exclusion was error; we disagree.[6]Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and absent a clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375 (2005). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support. Â Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the wrongly admitted or excluded evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nGenerally, in order for an out of court experiment to be admissible, the experiment must â€œbe made under conditions and circumstances similar to those prevailing at the time of the occurrence involved in the controversy.â€Â  State v. Frazier, 357 S.C. 161, 166, 592 S.E.2d 621, 623 (2004) (quoting Weaks v. S.C. State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 250 S.C. 535, 542, 159 S.E.2d 234, 237 (1968)).Â  â€œIt\r\nis not required that the conditions be identical with those existing at the time of the controversy; it is sufficient if there is a substantial similarity.â€Â  Id.  (quoting Weaks, 250 S.C. at 542, 159 S.E.2d at 237).Â  \r\nRelevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove the existence of a material fact and is generally admissible.Â  Rule 401, SCRE; Rule 402, SCRE.Â  However, â€œ[t]he dictates of Rule 401 are subject to the balancing requirement of Rule 403, SCRE, which requires a court to exclude relevant evidence upon a showing that its admission would be more prejudicial than probative.â€Â  Watson ex rel. Watson v. Chapman, 343 S.C. 471, 478, 540 S.E.2d 484, 487 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Under Rule 403, SCRE, â€œalthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .â€Â  Moreover, â€œ[a] trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.â€Â  \r\nState v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (citation omitted) (stating that under the abuse of discretion standard the reviewing court is â€œobligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgmentâ€).Â  \r\nJamison sought to introduce the 1995 video crash tests to demonstrate the effect of impact on occupant kinematics.Â  Admittedly, the excluded video illustrated a vehicle and collision substantially similar to the 1993 Escort and accident in this case. Â However, unlike the 1993 Escort, the vehicle in the excluded video was equipped with airbags that deployed upon impact.Â  Ford maintained â€œ[i]t cannot be said that the air bag going off into the face and the chest of the dummy does not affect the dummyâ€™s occupant kinematics.â€Â  The circuit court observed that the 1995 video crash tests presented:\r\n\r\n[o]ne of the rare occasions that I believe it covers just about every one that is mentioned in 403.Â  Clearly the danger of an unfair prejudice is there.Â  Confusion of the issue is clearly there.Â  Misleading the jury is clearly there because it makesâ€”thereâ€™s no way for testimony to undo whatâ€™s visual.\r\n\r\nThe juryâ€™s susceptibility to influences associated with viewing a crash test involving an airbag can reasonably be recognized as substantially outweighing the testsâ€™ probative value.Â  We defer to the circuit courtâ€™s judgment in this instance.Â  \r\nIII. Discovery Abuses\r\nJamison challenges the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to sanction Ford for alleged discovery abuses.Â  We discern no error in the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nPursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C), SCRCP, when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the court may â€œmake such orders in regard to the failure as are just,â€ including an order dismissing the action or proceeding, or any part thereof. Â Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc., 370 S.C. 383, 390, 635 S.E.2d 541, 544 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing In re Anonymous Member of the S.C. Bar, 346 S.C. 177, 194, 552 S.E.2d 10, 18 (2001) (â€œ[j]udges must use their authority to make sure that abusive deposition tactics and other forms of discovery abuse do not succeed in their ultimate goal: achieving success through abuse of the discovery rules rather than by the rule of law.â€). Â Generally, â€œthe sanction should be aimed at the specific conduct of the party sanctioned and not go beyond the necessities of the situation to foreclose a decision on the merits of a case.â€ Â Griffin Grading &amp; Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., Inc., 334 S.C. 193, 198, 511 S.E.2d 716, 719 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nThe imposition of sanctions is generally entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court. Â Halverson v. Yawn, 328 S.C. 618, 620-21, 493 S.E.2d 883, 884 (Ct. App. 1997); Downey v. Dixon, 294 S.C. 42, 46, 362 S.E.2d 317, 318 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision regarding the imposition of discovery sanctions will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 111, 495 S.E.2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. 1997).Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nâ€œIn deciding what sanction to impose for failure to disclose evidence during the discovery process, the trial court should weigh the nature of the interrogatories, the discovery posture of the case, willfulness, and the degree of prejudice.â€Â  Samples, 329 S.C. at 112, 495 S.E.2d at 216.Â  A failure to weigh the required factors demonstrates a failure to exercise discretion and amounts to an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. Â Â Â \r\nHere, the record indicates the circuit court considered the nature of the requests for production, the discovery posture of the case, Fordâ€™s lack of intent or willfulness, and the degree of prejudice Jamison suffered.Â  During the pre-trial hearing, the circuit court noted Jamison demonstrated no prejudice, Ford adhered to the continuing rule to supplement responses to production requests, and nothing suggested Ford knew about the evidence at issue.Â  Moreover, the record fails to substantiate that Ford either knew about or possessed the evidence in question when initially responding to Jamisonâ€™s discovery requests.Â  In fact, Ford complied with the rules of discovery by confirming that Mazda possessed the evidence and forwarding Jamisonâ€™s request to Mazda.Â  Indeed, Jamison admitted all documents in question were originally produced by Mazda.Â  Additionally, Ford satisfied the rule requiring continued supplementation of responses to interrogatories.Â  \r\nJamison implored the court to sanction Ford by prohibiting reference to the 1993 Escortâ€™s compliance with federal regulations.Â  The circuit court found no evidence Ford acted in bad faith with the willful disobedience or gross indifference required for a sanction that would be tantamount to default judgment.Â  See Griffin Grading &amp; Clearing, Inc., 334 S.C. at 198-99, 511 S.E.2d at 719 (â€œWhere the sanction would be tantamount to granting a judgment by default, the moving party must show bad faith, willful disobedience or gross indifference to its rights to justify the sanction.â€).Â  Conclusively, the circuit court exercised sound discretion in refraining from the imposition of discovery abuse sanctions. \r\nIV. Rule 60(b), SCRCP, Motion\r\nJamison next argues the circuit erred in denying its Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment.Â  Jamison contends the advertising brochure for the European Escort provided evidence of an existing alternative design and was material to its case.Â  In addition, Jamison professes that the brochure provided a basis for sanctions against Ford for abuse of discovery.Â  We disagree. \r\nGenerally, the decision to grant a new trial under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the circuit court.Â  Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2005).Â  The appellate court will reverse a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding the grant or denial of a Rule 60(b) motion only if it amounts to an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 18, 594 S.E.2d at\r\n482.&nbsp;\r\nA.&nbsp; Newly Discovered Evidence\r\nThe circuit court may relieve a party from a final judgment where â€œnewly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).â€Â  Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  â€œA party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief.â€Â  Perry v. Heirs at Law of Gadsden, 357 S.C. 42, 46, 590 S.E.2d 502, 504 (Ct. App. 2003). Â To obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a movant must establish that the newly discovered evidence: (1) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could not have been discovered before the trial; (4) is material to the issue; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 217, 612 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).Â  Courts have found evidence is not newly discovered evidence for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(2) where the evidence was (1) known to the party at the time of trial, and (2) in the partyâ€™s possession. Â Id. at 218, 612 S.E.2d at 459.Â  In addition, Rule 60(b)(2) allows the court to grant a new trial only if the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence prior to trial.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œdue diligenceâ€ as â€œ[t]he diligence reasonably expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a person who seeks to satisfy a legal requirement or to discharge an obligation.â€Â  468 (7th ed. 1999). Â Furthermore, exclusion of testimony that would be merely cumulative or impeaching does not constitute error. Â See Gamble v. International Paper Realty Corp. of South Carolina, 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996) (ruling that where excluded testimony was merely cumulative there was no error).\r\nIn the case at bar, the circuit court ruled the brochure advertising the European Escort that Jamison advanced as newly discovered evidence would not likely change the result in a new trial and was merely cumulative.Â  As a threshold requirement, before the brochure or any test regarding the European Escort could be admissible, Jamison had to demonstrate the European Escort was substantially similar to the 1993 Escort at issue.Â  See State v. Frazier, 357 S.C. 161, 166, 592 S.E.2d 621, 623 (2004) (holding an out of court experiment will only be admissible if proven to be substantially similar to the occurrence involved in the controversy).Â  Jamison could not prove the European Escort was substantially similar to the 1993 Escort.Â  Concomitantly, Ford provided an affidavit stating the vehicles differed significantly in structural design.Â  \r\nJamison urged that the brochure constituted new evidence of a feasible alternative designâ€”a critical and material element of its defective design claim.Â  The circuit court noted, however, that Jamison had presented evidence of a feasible alternative design at trial. Â Jamison submitted a 1987 Volkswagen as an example of an effective passive restraint system with a seat pan that could successfully restrain the lower torso in an accident like the one in this case.Â  Thus, the brochure, as evidence of a feasible alternative design, albeit one Ford employed, is merely cumulative of evidence introduced at trial.Â  Jamisonâ€™s potential use of the brochure for impeachment of Fordâ€™s witness does not support granting the Rule 60(b) motion.Â  See Lanier, 364 S.C. at 217, 612 S.E.2d at 459. \r\nB.&nbsp; Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Other Misconduct\r\nRule 60(b)(3), SCRCP authorizes the circuit court to relieve a party from a final judgment where the party demonstrates â€œfraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.â€Â  In South Carolina, in order for a party to be entitled to relief based on fraud, the moving party must demonstrate extrinsic fraud.Â  Raby Constr., LLP v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 20-21, 594 S.E.2d 478, 484 (2005); Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 431, 529 S.E.2d 714, 717 (2000) (â€œA judgment may be set aside on the ground of fraud only if the fraud is â€˜extrinsicâ€™ and not â€˜intrinsic.â€™â€).Â  Fraud is extrinsic when it is collateral to the issues tried in a case and effectively deprives the litigant of a fair hearing or the opportunity to present its case.Â  Id. (citing Â Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv, Commâ€™n of S. C., 294 S.C. 9, 362 S.E.2d 176 (1987); Mr. G. v. Mrs. G., 320 S.C. 305, 465 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995). Â â€œRelief is granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that because the fraud prevented a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there has never been a real contest before the court on the subject matter of the action.â€ Â Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 81, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003) (citing Hilton Head, 294 S.C. at 11, 362 S.E.2d at 177). Â On the other hand, intrinsic fraud is fraud presented and considered at the trial. Â Hagy, 339 S.C. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at 484 (citing Evans v. Gunter, 366 S.E.2d 44, 294 S.C. 525 (Ct. App. 1988)).Â  Intrinsic fraud misleads a court in determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the fraud.Â  Chewning, 354 S.C. at 81, 579 S.C.2d at 610 (citing Hilton Head, 294 S.C. at 11, 362 S.E.2d at 177).\r\nJamison maintains Ford engaged in fraudulent conduct by withholding the brochure; consequently, the circuit court should grant relief from judgment.Â  The record fails to substantiate Jamisonâ€™s allegations that Ford intentionally withheld documents.Â  Moreover, the assertion that a party failed to disclose documents generally amounts to intrinsic rather than extrinsic fraud.Â  Raby Constr., 358 S.C. at 19, 594 S.E.2d at 483.\r\nAccordingly, Jamison was not entitled to a Rule 60(b) relief from judgment on either newly discovered evidence or fraud. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the Safety Act, FMVSS 208, and Geier prohibit a state common law tort action based on the choice of design of a passive vehicle passenger restraint system.Â  We rule that a state common tort action is permitted if bottomed and premised on defects in design and/or implementation of the chosen restraint system.Â  \r\nFinally, we place our imprimatur and approbation upon the arbitraments of the circuit court in regard to:Â  (1) the exclusion of Jamisonâ€™s expert testimony in reference to the manual lap belt; (2) the disallowance of video crash tests of the 1995 Escort with a driver side airbag; (3) the denial of Jamisonâ€™s motion for sanctions; and (4) the rejection of Jamisonâ€™s motion for relief from judgment.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the rulings and orders of the circuit court are \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n KITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Jamison additionally averred that Ford failed to provide adequate warnings about proper use of the restraint system.Â  However, this appeal does not involve claims regarding whether any warnings were inadequate.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Jamisonâ€™s attorney received the crash test documents from a plaintiffâ€™s attorney involved in other litigation with Ford.\r\n[4] Field preemption occurs when federal law so occupies a field that state courts are prevented from asserting jurisdiction.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, 612 (6th ed. 1990).Â  Field preemption is not implicated in the instant case.\r\n[5] Components other than a belt provided lower torso restraint. \r\n[6] Because of our disposition of this issue, we decline to address Fordâ€™s contention that Jamison waived this issue by failing to properly challenge the legal grounds on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4221","title":"Bowers v.

Corson, of Lake Wylie, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Jerry Thomas appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order terminating his lease agreement with Edward Bowers.Â  Thomas contends: (1) there was insufficient notice to terminate the lease agreement; (2) the lease could not be terminated based on the tardy payment of the June rent; and (3) the circuit court erred in denying his request for a jury trial. Â We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn March 1, 2005, Bowers and Thomas entered into a written rental agreement governed by the South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (â€œthe RLTAâ€).Â  Rent was due and payable in advance on the first day of each month.Â  The rental agreement gave Thomas the option to purchase the property, provided Thomas was not in default at the time.Â  The agreement provided:Â  \r\n\r\nLANDLORDâ€™S REMEDIES.Â  If Tenant defaults in the payment of rent, or any other item to be paid by Tenant under this Lease, and that default is not cured within ten (10) days, except for the payment of rent, after written notice of default by Landlord to Tenant, it being agreed that rent shall be due and payable without notice, Landlord may re-enter and take possession of the Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises, and at its option terminate this Lease, and shall have such rights as are available under South Carolina law.Â  Tenant and Landlord agree that if rent is not paid within ten (10) days of its due date, this Lease and the attached Option Agreement shall both terminate immediately without further notice.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis in original).Â  \r\nIn June 2005, Thomas failed to pay the June rent at the time it was due.Â  After receiving written notice of his June default and Bowersâ€™ intent to terminate the lease, Thomas delivered a check for the rent to Bowersâ€™ attorney.Â  The check, dated June 23, 2005, was returned to Thomasâ€™ lawyer.Â  Thomasâ€™ lawyer then mailed the check back to Bowersâ€™ counsel; however, it was never received, and the June rent remained unpaid.Â  \r\nRent payments continued to be late.Â  The July 2005 rent was not paid until the fourteenth of the month.Â  On July 15, 2005, Bowers gave Thomas written notice of nonpayment of rent when due and his intention to terminate the lease agreement if rent was not paid within ten days from the due date.Â  Specifically, the notice stated:\r\n\r\nIf you do not pay your rent on time this is your notice.Â  If you do not pay your rent within 10 days of the due date, the landlord can start to have you evicted.Â  You will get no other notice as long as you live in this rental unit. Â \r\n\r\nThe August 2005 rent was not paid within ten days of its due date.Â  On August 11, 2005, the magistrate issued an order and rule to show cause, ordering Thomas to either vacate the premises, or appear and show cause why he should not be evicted.Â  On August 12, 2005, Thomas delivered a check to Bowersâ€™ attorney with the mutual agreement that such acceptance would not constitute a waiver of any default.Â  \r\nA bench trial was scheduled for August 23, 2005.Â  Four working days before the trial, Thomas requested a jury trial. Â The magistrate denied the request as untimely, but rescheduled the bench trial.Â  After the bench trial on September 1, 2005, the magistrate ordered Thomasâ€™s eviction and payment of all accrued rent.Â  Thomas appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the magistrateâ€™s order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 18-7-170 of the South Carolina Code (1985) articulates the standard of review to be applied by the circuit court in an appeal of a magistrateâ€™s judgment:Â  \r\n\r\nUpon hearing the appeal, the appellate court shall give judgment according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors and defects which do not affect the merits.Â  In giving judgment, the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors of law or fact.\r\n\r\nSee also Hadfield v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88, 92-93, 538 S.E.2d 268, 270 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nWhile the Circuit Court maintains a broad scope of review, our standard is more limited:\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he Court of Appeals will presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a magistrateâ€™s judgment was made upon the merits where the testimony is sufficient to sustain the judgment of the magistrate and there are no facts that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law. \r\n\r\nBurns v. Wannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 357, 315 S.E.2d 179, 182 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Specifically, â€œ[i]n ejectment proceedings first heard in magistrateâ€™s court, the Court of Appeals is without jurisdiction to reverse the findings of fact of the circuit court if there is any supporting evidence.â€Â  Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc. v. Kiwi Corp., 280 S.C. 232, 233, 312 S.E.2d 20, 21 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œUnless we find an error of law, we will affirm the judgeâ€™s holding if there are any facts supporting his decision.â€Â  Hadfield, 343 S.C. at 94, 538 S.E.2d at 271.\r\nHowever, as recognized in Hadfield, the Court of Appeals still retains de novo review of whether the facts show the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance was controlled or affected by errors of law.Â  Hadfield at 92-93, 53 S.E.2d at 270.Â  Our Supreme Court, in Stanford v. Cudd, 93 S.C. 367, 370, 76 S.E. 986, 987 (1913), held that where the testimony is sufficient to sustain a judgment of the magistrateâ€™s court, and it is affirmed on appeal to the circuit court, this court will assume the circuit court affirmed the judgment on the merits, in the absence of facts showing the affirmance was controlled or affected by errors of law.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Default \r\nThomas contends the circuit court erred in finding there was legally sufficient notice to justify termination of his lease.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 27-40-710 of the South Carolina Code (2007) governs a landlordâ€™s remedies in situations where a tenant fails to pay rent when due.Â  In pertinent part, section 27-40-710(B) states:Â  \r\n\r\nIf rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days from the date due or the tenant is in violation of section 27-40-540, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement provided the landlord has given the tenant written notice of nonpayment and his intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period. Â The landlordâ€™s obligation to provide notice under this section is satisfied for any lease term after the landlord has given one such notice to the tenant or if the notice is contained in conspicuous language in a written rental agreement. Â The written notice requirement upon the landlord under this subsection shall be considered to have been complied with if the rental agreement contains the following or a substantially equivalent provision:\r\n  \r\nâ€œIF YOU DO NOT PAY YOUR RENT ON TIME\r\nThis is your notice. If you do not pay your rent within five days of the due date, the landlord can start to have you evicted. You will get no other notice as long as you live in this rental unit.â€\r\n  \r\nThe presence of this provision in the rental agreement fully satisfies the â€œwritten noticeâ€ requirement under this subsection and applies to a month-to-month tenancy following the specified lease term in the original rental agreement.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis in original).Â  \r\nThomas contends the circuit court erred in finding that Bowers gave proper notice of non-compliance with the lease agreement, under section 27-40-710(B).Â  In this instance, notice was provided not by â€œconspicuous languageâ€ in the partiesâ€™ lease agreement, but by the July 15, 2005 letter mailed notifying Thomas that any subsequent nonpayment would result in eviction.Â  This letter indubitably satisfies the language contained in section 27-40-710(B).Â  Despite receiving this notice in July, Thomas failed to pay his August rent in a timely manner.Â  In fact, the August rent was not paid until after the magistrate issued the rule to show cause.Â  \r\nBecause a landlordâ€™s obligation to provide notice is satisfied for any lease term after the landlord has given one such notice to the tenant, the landlord was not required to furnish any separate or additional written notice to Thomas in order to commence proceedings in August for nonpayment of rent when due.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-710(B) (2007).Â  Â Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in finding there was sufficient notice to terminate the lease after the late payment of the August rent.Â  \r\nThomas devotes a great deal of his brief to the position that the language in the lease agreement was not â€œbold and conspicuousâ€ as required by the statute.Â  However, we need not reach this issue because Thomas had sufficient notice under section 27-40-710(B) from the July 2005 letter of the consequences if he failed to pay his rent in a timely manner.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Thomas argues the lease agreement should not have been terminated based on the June rent because his rent check was returned to him after he delivered it to Bowersâ€™ attorney.Â  However, this argument is flawed as the lease was not terminated based on Thomasâ€™s failure to pay the June rent, but rather was terminated based on his failure to pay the August rent after the notice was sent in July.Â  The June check was dated June 23, 2005, twenty-two days after its due date.Â  This check was lost, and as of the date of the circuit courtâ€™s order, payment for June rent has not been made and Thomas is still liable for the June 2005 rent. \r\nB.Â  Jury Trial \r\nThomas contends the circuit court erred in denying his request for a jury trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially, this issue has not been preserved for our review.Â  Bowers never objected to the magistrateâ€™s ruling concerning a jury trial.Â  An issue not raised to and ruled upon by the court is not preserved for appeal.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).\r\nFurthermore, Thomas has waived this issue.Â  If an order deprives a party of a mode of trial to which that party is entitled as a matter of right, the order is\r\nimmediately appealable and failure to do so forever bars appellate review.Â  Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 72, 533 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2000); Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 23, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993).Â  Because Thomas failed to immediately appeal his denial of a jury trial, he is barred from raising this issue on appeal.\r\nMoreover, this issue fails on the merits.Â  Rule 11(b), SCMCR states that â€œIf either party wants a jury trial it must be requested in writing at least five working days prior to the date set for trial.â€Â  The Notice of Hearing shows the trial was set for August 23, 2005.Â  Thomasâ€™s written request for a jury trial was not submitted to the magistrate until August 17, 2005, only four working days prior to trial.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in finding Thomasâ€™s request untimely and affirming the denial of a jury trial.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above analysis, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4222","title":"Rhodes v.

(Benson) for\r\n  breach of contract in connection with the purchase of a vehicle.[2]Â  Benson answered,\r\n  pleading the contract contained an arbitration provision that encompassed Rhodesâ€™ allegations.Â  Benson, however, did not promptly pursue arbitration, opting instead\r\n  to engage in extensive discovery.Â  Benson and Rhodes exchanged written\r\n  interrogatories and requests for production.Â  Benson also noticed and took five\r\n  depositions.Â  Benson sought the circuit courtâ€™s assistance in executing\r\n  out-of-state subpoenas, which the circuit court granted.Â  The circuit court\r\n  heard two motions for protective orders.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  February 2006, ten months after Rhodes initiated this action, Benson filed a\r\n  motion to compel arbitration.Â  Rhodes opposed Bensonâ€™s attempt to resurrect its\r\n  right to arbitrate under the contract.Â  Rhodes argued Benson waived its right\r\n  to compel arbitration by participating in significant discovery before pursuing\r\n  arbitration.Â  The circuit court agreed with Rhodes, and denied Bensonâ€™s motion\r\n  to compel arbitration.Â  It further appears that the case was scheduled for\r\n  trial before the circuit court ruled on Bensonâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.Â \r\n  Benson appeals.\r\nII.\r\nâ€œ[D]etermining whether a party waived its right to arbitrate is a\r\n  legal conclusion subject to de novo review; nevertheless, the circuit judgeâ€™s\r\n  factual findings underlying that conclusion will not be overruled if there is\r\n  any evidence reasonably supporting them.â€Â  Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton,\r\n  336 S.C. 658, 664-65, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\nIII.\r\nSouth Carolina favors arbitration.Â  Gen. Equip. &amp; Supply Co. v. Keller Rigging &amp;\r\n  Constr., Inc., 344 S.C. 553, 556, 544 S.E.2d 643, 645 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The\r\n  right to enforce an arbitration clause, however, may be waived.Â  Liberty\r\n    Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 665, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â  â€œIn order to establish waiver, a party must show prejudice through an\r\n  undue burden caused by delay in demanding arbitration.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThere is\r\n  no set rule as to what constitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the\r\n  question depends on the facts of each case.â€Â  Id. \r\nGenerally,\r\n  the factors our courts consider to determine if a party waived its right to\r\n  compel arbitration are: (1) whether a substantial length of time transpired\r\n  between the commencement of the action and the commencement of the motion to\r\n  compel arbitration; (2) whether the party requesting arbitration engaged in\r\n  extensive discovery before moving to compel arbitration; and (3) whether the\r\n  non-moving party was prejudiced by the delay in seeking arbitration.Â  These\r\n  factors, of course, are not mutually exclusive, as one factor may be\r\n  inextricably connected to, and influenced by, the others. \r\nThus, a\r\n  party may waive its right to compel arbitration if a substantial length of time\r\n  transpires between the commencement of the action and the commencement of the\r\n  motion to compel arbitration.Â  What is â€œa substantial length of timeâ€ varies\r\n  from one case to the next, depending on the extent of discovery conducted and\r\n  the corresponding presence or absence of prejudice to the party opposing\r\n  arbitration.Â  Compare Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP v. Unisys Corp.,\r\n  358 S.C. 179, 184, 594 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding a\r\n  five-and-a-half year period where the parties â€œconducted a significant amount of discovery, resulting in\r\n  the production of thousands of documentsâ€ demonstrated waiver); and Evans v. Accent Manufactured Homes,\r\n    Inc., 352 S.C. 544, 548, 575 S.E.2d 74, 75-76 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding a\r\n  nineteen month period where the\r\n  parties exchanged written interrogatories, requests to produce, and the party\r\n  requesting arbitration took two depositions demonstrated waiver); and Liberty Builders, 336 S.C. at 666, 521\r\n  S.E.2d at 753-54 (finding a two-and-a-half year period where the parties sought assistance from\r\n  the court on approximately forty occasions demonstrated waiver); with Tolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v.\r\n    Trident Constr. Co., 355 S.C. 605, 612, 586 S.E.2d 581, 585 (2003) (finding\r\n  a thirteen month period where\r\n  discovery was â€œvery limited in nature and the parties had not availed\r\n  themselves of the courtâ€™s assistance,â€ and â€œRespondent had not held any\r\n  depositions,â€ did not demonstrate\r\n  waiver); and Rich v. Walsh, 357 S.C. 64, 67, 590 S.E.2d 506, 507\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003) (finding a thirteen month period where â€œ[l]imited discovery was conductedâ€ and the party\r\n  requesting arbitration took one deposition lasting fifteen minutes did not demonstrate waiver); and Gen.\r\n    Equip., 344 S.C. at 557, 544 S.E.2d at 645 (finding a period of less than\r\n  eight months where the\r\n  â€œlitigation consisted of routine administrative matters and limited discovery\r\n  which did not involve the taking of depositions or extensive interrogatoriesâ€ did not establish waiver).\r\nTo establish prejudice, the non-moving party must show something\r\n  more than â€œmere inconvenience.â€Â  Evans, 352 S.C. at 550, 575 S.E.2d at\r\n  76-77.Â  To ascertain whether the non-moving party was prejudiced, our courts\r\n  often examine whether the party requesting arbitration took â€œadvantage of the\r\n  judicial system by engaging in discovery.â€Â  Id. at 548, 575 S.E.2d at\r\n  76.Â  This inquiry, however, is just part of a broader, common sense approach\r\n  our courts take to determine whether a motion to compel arbitration should be\r\n  granted or denied: (1) if the parties conduct little or no discovery, then the\r\n  party seeking arbitration has not taken â€œadvantage of the judicial system,â€ prejudice\r\n  will likely not exist, and the law would favor arbitration; (2) if the parties\r\n  conduct significant discovery, then the party seeking arbitration has taken\r\n  â€œadvantage of the judicial system,â€ prejudice will likely exist, and the law\r\n  would disfavor arbitration.Â  Of course, cases do not always fit neatly into\r\n  clearly defined categories, which is why our law resists a formulaic approach\r\n  and motions to compel arbitration are resolved only after a fact-intensive\r\n  inquiry.Â  Accordingly, each case turns on its particular facts.Â Â  \r\nThis case, we believe, falls between the General Equipment line of cases (Tolerâ€™s Cove and Rich) and the Liberty Builders line of cases (Evans and Deloitte).Â  Because Benson sought\r\n  arbitration less than a year after Rhodes brought suit, General Equipment suggests that a substantial length of time may not have transpired to warrant\r\n  waiver.Â  Indeed, as cited above, there is precedent where arbitration was\r\n  compelled with an even greater length of time between the commencement of the action\r\n  and the commencement of the motion to compel arbitration.Â  See Tolerâ€™s\r\n    Cove, 355 S.C. at 612, 586 S.E.2d at 585 (finding a thirteen month period\r\n  did not demonstrate waiver); Rich, 357 S.C. at 72, 590 S.E.2d at 507\r\n  (finding a thirteen month period did not demonstrate waiver).Â  What\r\n  distinguishes this case from the General Equipment line of cases,\r\n  however, is the extensive discovery engaged in by Rhodes and especially Benson,\r\n  as well as the fact that the\r\n  trial was imminent.Â  \r\nBenson and Rhodes exchanged written interrogatories and requests\r\n  to produce.Â  Benson also noticed and took five depositions.[3]Â  Furthermore,\r\n  before the circuit court ruled on Bensonâ€™s tardy motion to compel arbitration,\r\n  the chief administrative judge set the case on the trial docket for an upcoming\r\n  term of court.Â  The parties completed virtually all discovery before Benson moved to compel arbitration.Â  The extent of discovery, in conjunction\r\n  with the status of the case on the trial docket, provides a direct nexus to the\r\n  presence and degree of prejudice sustained by Rhodes, the party opposing\r\n  arbitration.Â  We are persuaded that under the facts presented here Benson\r\n  waived its right to compel arbitration.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nThe record amply supports the findings of the learned special\r\n  circuit court judge.Â  Benson, with full knowledge of its right to arbitrate\r\n  this dispute, cannot invoke and enjoy the full benefits of discovery and then\r\n  belatedly assert a right to arbitrate at the eleventh hour with the case\r\n  approaching trial.Â  The order of the circuit court denying the motion to compel\r\n  arbitration is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  According to the complaint, Rhodes agreed to\r\n  purchase a properly-titled, undamaged 2001 Dodge Durango from Benson, and not\r\n  the stolen, damaged 1999 Dodge Durango Rhodes received from Benson.\r\n[3]Â  Depositions entail more than â€œroutine administrative\r\n  matters,â€Â  Gen. Equip., 344 S.C. at 557, 544 S.E.2d at 645, and could\r\n  not be considered â€œlimited discoveryâ€ in any sense of the phrase.Â  Certainly,\r\n  taking five depositions was more than a â€œmere inconvenienceâ€ to Rhodes.Â  Depositions involve substantial time, effort, and money, all of which could have\r\n  been avoided if Benson had pursued arbitration earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4223","title":"Arcadian Shores v.

Cromer to comply with certain restrictive covenants.Â  The Association contends the master erred in (1) refusing to find Cromer had actual or constructive knowledge of the 1985 Regulations; (2) failing to hold Cromerâ€™s motor home violated the intent and purpose of the 1965 Declaration; (3) finding Cromerâ€™s motor home did not violate the plain language of the 1985 Regulations; (4) holding the Association abandoned its right to enforce the restrictive covenants; (5) denying its claim for injunctive relief; and (6) awarding Cromer the costs of complying with a temporary injunction.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 11, 1965, Ocean Lakes Investment Company (Developer) adopted and recorded a declaration of restrictions (the 1965 Declaration) applying to lots 5 through 97 of the Arcadian Shores Subdivision (the Subdivision).Â  The 1965 Declaration provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n4. . . . No building, outbuilding, addition, or fencing shall be constructed without first submitting plans and specifications to and obtaining the written approval of the plans by the Developer, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.\r\n. . . . \r\n7. . . Lot owners will comply with such reasonable regulations as the Developer may make as to the location of fixtures or appliances . . . and as to parking or storage of commercial vehicles, boats or machinery on the premises.\r\n8. Except as incidental and necessary to permanent building construction . . . no mobile home, temporary structure or garage apartment shall be erected upon the lot.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1982, the Developerâ€™s trustee executed and recorded a corrective quit-claim deed in favor of the Association, purporting to convey all of its rights in the Subdivision, particularly the following:\r\n\r\nAll of the [Developerâ€™s] rights under recorded restrictions applicable to [the Subdivision] to enforce any and all such restrictions . . . to approve or disapprove plans and specifications . . . to make regulations permitted by the Subdivision restrictions and to enforce same . . . .[2]Â  \r\n\r\nOn January 15, 1985, the Association attempted to enact a set of regulations applicable to the Subdivision (the 1985 Regulations).[3]Â  The 1985 Regulations specify, in detail, the applicable fencing limits and plainly prohibit motor homes and travel trailers from being parked where they are visible from the street.Â  The 1985 Regulations were also recorded.Â Â  \r\nOn March 24, 2000, the homeowners in the Subdivision elected to create a Special Tax District.Â  Although the Association assigned and delegated many of its rights and duties to the Special Tax District, it retained all of its rights to enforce recorded restrictions, approve or disapprove plans and specifications, and make regulations.Â Â  Â \r\nOn July 2, 2003, Cromer obtained title to Lot 96 in the Subdivision.Â  After she purchased Lot 96, she sought to park a motor home and trailer on the property.Â  The motor home and trailer together were seventy feet long.Â  In addition, she submitted plans and specifications to the Association in order to get approval for a fence and other building modifications on the property.Â  The plans called for a three foot high masonry lattice wall in the front yard of Lot 96. Â The Association approved these plans.Â  However, Cromer built a three foot high solid stucco wall instead.Â  \r\nOn January 23, 2004, the Association filed a complaint against Cromer, seeking to enjoin her from parking her motor home in a place where it would be visible from the street and to require Cromer to remove her fence.Â  Cromer answered, denying her motor home or fence violated the applicable restrictive covenants.Â  The Association sought and obtained a temporary injunction requiring Cromer to comply with the 1985 Regulations with respect to her motor home.Â  As a precondition to issuing this injunction, the circuit court required the Association submit a $10,000 surety bond to reimburse Cromer should the injunction later be overruled.Â  \r\nAfter an order of reference, the master held a hearing and ultimately denied the Associationâ€™s requests regarding both the motor home and the fence.Â  Of consequence to the present appeal, the master made the following findings and conclusions: (1) the 1985 Regulations were not valid because they were not properly signed, acknowledged, or indexed; (2) the 1965 Declaration does not prohibit Cromerâ€™s motor home; (3) the Association abandoned its right to approve of fencing; and (4) Cromer should receive $9,000 of the surety bond for reimbursement of expenses associated with the temporary injunction.Â  This appeal followed. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.â€Â  Seabrook Is. Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 661, 596 S.E.2d 380, 383&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  In equitable actions, the appellate court may make findings of fact in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834&nbsp;(2005).Â  However, the appellate court is not required to ignore the findings of the master when the master was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Siau v. Kassel,&nbsp;369 S.C. 631, 638, 632 S.E.2d 888, 892&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. The Motor Home\r\nThe Association contends the master erred in refusing to order Cromer to comply with the 1985 Regulations regarding the parking of her motor home and trailer.Â  Specifically, the Association argues (1) Cromer had actual or constructive notice of the 1985 Regulations; (2) the 1985 Regulations prohibit the parking of Cromerâ€™s mobile home in an area visible from the street; (3) alternatively, the motor home violated the intent and purpose of the 1965 Declaration; (4) the Association did not waive its right to enforce the motor home restrictions; and (5) as a consequence of the above, the master erred in refusing to issue the injunction and finding Cromer entitled to $9,000 of the surety bond.\r\nA. The Law of the Case\r\nWe recognize the master ruled the 1985 Regulations were invalid because they were improperly signed, acknowledged, and indexed.Â  While the Association appealed the issue of whether the Association properly indexed the 1985 Regulations, nothing in the Associationâ€™s appellate brief addresses the issue of whether the master erred in finding the 1985 Regulations were not validly signed or acknowledged.Â  Because the Association did not appeal this ruling, it is the law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472&nbsp;(1997) (recognizing an unappealed finding of the master, right or wrong, is the law of the case and should not be considered by this court).Â  \r\nIn addition, based on this conclusion, we need not address the issue of whether Cromer had actual or constructive notice of the 1985 Regulations, whether the 1985 Regulations prohibited the parking of the motor home, or whether the Association waived its right to enforce the motor home restriction.Â  See Anderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477&nbsp;(1996) (holding when a decision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the law of the case).Â  Accordingly, we proceed to consider whether the 1965 Declaration, standing alone, precludes the parking of Cromerâ€™s motor home in an area visible from the street.\r\nB. The 1965 Restrictions\r\nThe Association claims the 1965 Restrictions prohibit the parking of Cromerâ€™s motor home in an area visible from the street.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature.â€Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542&nbsp;(2006). Â The language in a restrictive covenant shall be construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the time of execution.Â Â  Seabrook, 358 S.C. at 661, 596 S.E.2d at 383.Â  â€œA restriction on the use of property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of the property.â€Â  Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 157, 263 S.E.2d 378, 380&nbsp;(1980) (citations omitted).Â  The court may not limit a restriction, nor will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction or implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms, even to accomplish what it may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written.Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 864&nbsp;(1998) (citations and quotations omitted).\r\nThe Association points to the following provisions of the 1965 Declaration in arguing it prohibits the parking of motor homes in an area visible from the street:\r\n\r\n7. . . Lot owners will comply with such reasonable regulations as the Developer may make as to the location of fixtures or appliances . . . and as to parking or storage of commercial vehicles, boats or machinery on the premises.\r\n8. Except as incidental and necessary to permanent building construction . . . no mobile home, temporary structure or garage apartment shall be erected upon the lot.\r\n\r\nThe first provision gives the Developer the power to enact regulations with respect to the parking or storage of commercial vehicles, boats, or machinery.Â  Assuming Cromerâ€™s motor home is a commercial vehicle or machinery, this provision does not contain any affirmative prohibition or limitation on its parking or storage.Â  \r\nWith respect to the second provision, the Association contends motor homes were largely unknown at the date of execution of the 1965 Declaration and the prohibition on erecting a mobile home shows an intent or purpose to regulate the parking of a motor home.Â  While the Supreme Court of South Carolina initially agreed with this contention in Nance v. Waldrop, 258 S.C. 69, 187 S.E.2d 226&nbsp;(1972), it subsequently rejected that line of thinking in Taylor, which overruled Nance.\r\nIn Nance, restrictions adopted in 1938 provided, in pertinent part: â€œNo house shall be erected thereon [on any lot] costing less than Four Thousand Five Hundred ($4,500.00) Dollars.â€Â  258 S.C. at 71, 187 S.E.2d at 227.Â  A subsequent purchaser placed his mobile home on the lot, and his neighbors sought an injunction enforcing the covenant.Â  Id. at 71-72, 187 S.E.2d at 227.Â  The master and circuit court held the mobile home violated the restriction and issued an injunction.Â  Id. at 72, 187 S.E.2d at 227.\r\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court noted the mobile home had been â€œvirtually unknownâ€ at the time the covenant was adopted.Â  Id. at 72, 187 S.E.2d at 228.Â  The Court ultimately concluded â€œ[t]he circumstances surrounding the inception of the restrictions and the developments subsequent thereto enforce the argument that the restrictions as drawn\r\nwere designed and intended to prevent uses such as the defendant is making of his lot.â€Â  Id. at 74-75, 187 S.E.2d at 229.\r\nIn Taylor, a restrictive covenant provided, in relevant part: â€œNo residence to cost less than $10,000.00 shall be erected on said lots . . . .â€Â  332 S.C. at 3, 498 S.E.2d at 863.Â  To prevent defendant from placing mobile homes on his lots, his neighbors sought an injunction pursuant to this covenant.Â  Id.Â  This court reversed the masterâ€™s refusal to grant the injunction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme Court questioned â€œhow the parties in Nance could have intended to prohibit mobile homes which were non-existent when the restrictive covenant was draftedâ€ and thereby overruled Nance.Â  Id. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864.Â  In addition, the Court explained: â€œHere, the restrictive covenant was written in the 1960s when mobile homes were prevalent. Â Therefore, if the grantor had wanted to restrict mobile homes, he could have done so.â€Â  Id. at 5, 498 S.E.2d at 864.\r\nApplying Taylor, we hold the Developer did not intend to prohibit the parking of a motor home when it adopted the 1965 Declaration.Â  Moreover, because the 1985 Regulations are not valid, no provision prohibits Cromer from parking her motor home on her property.Â  Therefore, we hold the master did not err in refusing to grant the Associationâ€™s injunction.Â  Because of this conclusion, we also affirm the masterâ€™s decision with respect to the surety bond.\r\nII. The Fencing\r\nThe Association maintains the master erred in refusing to order Cromer to tear down her fence.Â  In particular, the Association asserts (1) Cromer had actual or constructive notice of the Associationâ€™s right to approve of fencing; (2) the Association did not waive this right; and (3) as a consequence, the master erred in failing to grant the injunction.Â  We find it necessary only to address the issue of whether the Association waived its right to approve of Cromerâ€™s fence.\r\nA. Waiver\r\nThe Association contends the master erred in holding it waived its right to approve of fencing.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we reiterate our holding that the master found the 1985 Regulations were invalid and this ruling is the law of the case.Â  As a result, we consider only the 1965 Declaration in determining whether the Association waived its right.Â Â  The 1965 Declaration provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nNo building, outbuilding, addition, or fencing shall be constructed without first submitting plans and specifications to and obtaining the written approval of the plans by the Developer, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.\r\n\r\nWaiver has been defined as the intentional relinquishment of a known right.Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 267, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œNeither the restricting of every lot within the area covered, nor absolute identity of restrictions upon different lots is essential to the existence of a neighborhood scheme.â€\r\nÂ Pitts v. Brown,&nbsp; 215 S.C. 122, 130, 54 S.E.2d 538, 542&nbsp;(1949).Â  However, extensive omissions or variations tend to show that no scheme exists, and that the restrictions are only personal contracts.Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, testimony revealed some people did not submit plans or specifications for certain projects to the Association and that the Association inconsistently enforced this requirement.Â  Moreover, pictures of property throughout the neighborhood show the absence of any scheme with respect to fencing or other structures.Â  In fact, the Associationâ€™s current president testified the Associationâ€™s board was â€œfine with the fence,â€ and that Cromerâ€™s husband â€œcould have submitted a variance and it couldâ€™ve been approved by the board if he wouldâ€™ve been hospitable, but he took it on himself to do whatever.â€Â  Additionally, we defer to the masterâ€™s ability to observe the witnesses and emphasize that the master visited the Subdivision and was in the best position to determine the existence, if any, of a neighborhood scheme.Â  Accordingly, we hold a preponderance of the evidence supports the masterâ€™s conclusion that the Association waived its right to approve of plans and specifications with respect to Cromerâ€™s fence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the masterâ€™s ruling that the 1985 Regulations are invalid is the law of the case.Â  In addition, we find the 1965 Declaration does not prohibit the parking of Cromerâ€™s motor home and trailer on her property.Â  Consequently, we need not address the Associationâ€™s other contentions with respect to the motor home and affirm the masterâ€™s decision with respect to the surety bond.Â  \r\nRegarding Cromerâ€™s fence, we hold a preponderance of the evidence supports the masterâ€™s conclusion that the Association waived its right to require approval.Â  As a result, we find the master did not abuse his discretion in denying the Associationâ€™s request for injunctive relief.Â  Based on the foregoing, the masterâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] This recorded deed corrected a prior quit claim deed which did not include the specific rights enumerated.Â  \r\n[3] Fifteen days later, the Association adopted a second declaration which neither party uses to justify relief on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4224","title":"Gissel v.

McEachern.Â  We vacate in part and affirm in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2000, the Gissels purchased a mobile home for the stated cash price of $73,919.34 from Homes America, Inc.Â  Around the same time, McEachern purchased a mobile home for a stated cash price of $76,855.00 from Homes America.Â  The sales contracts for each of these two transactions listed Homes America as the â€œDEALERâ€ and were signed as â€œApprovedâ€ by Gene Hart.Â  The contracts each contained an identical Notice of Arbitration Provision.[1]Â  Homes America subsequently merged into Southern Showcase Housing, Inc.Â  \r\nIn 2003, the Gissels and McEachern initiated separate actions against â€œHomes America, Inc., Southern Showcase Housing, Inc., Charles Hart, Gene Hart and Amery English,â€ alleging claims for (1) negligence, (2) fraud, and (3) breach of contract with fraudulent intent.Â  The amended complaints asserted claims against â€œthe Defendants, jointly, severally and in the alternativeâ€ and sought â€œboth actual and punitive damages on each of the above causes of action in an amount to be determined by a jury, together with the cost of this action.â€Â  The complaints essentially asserted the mobile homes were improperly installed and contained a number of defects.Â  Â Â \r\nSouthern Showcase Housing filed separate Motions to Dismiss against the Gissels and McEachern in August 2003.Â  In September 2003, the Harts also filed Motions to Dismiss separately against the Gissels and McEachern.Â  The motions filed by the Harts were virtually identical to those filed by Southern Showcase Housing and asserted the complaints should be dismissed with prejudice and the matters referred to arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)[2] â€œas required in the contract by and between the parties.â€Â  The same attorney represented both Southern Showcase Housing and the Harts.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court construed the motions as being to stay litigation and compel arbitration.Â  The court issued two orders granting the motions, one with the Gissels as the plaintiffs, and the other with McEachern as the named plaintiff.Â  In each order, the court stated, â€œThis litigation is hereby stayed, and the parties are ordered to arbitrate this matter pursuant to the [FAA] . . . .â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  The captions in both orders identified the defendants Southern Showcase Housing, the Harts, and Amery English as parties.[3]  \r\nAt the arbitration hearing, the Harts made an appearance through counsel, who presented evidence on their behalf.Â  According to the Harts, â€œDefendants Homes America, Inc., Gene Hart and Charles Hart only offered one witness, David Bennett, administrator of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board. . . .Â  Basically, Mr. Bennett testified the damages alleged in the Plaintiffsâ€™ Amended Complaint were the financial responsibility of Defendant Homes America, Inc.â€Â  \r\nDuring the course of the arbitration proceedings, Southern Showcase Housing settled with the Gissels and McEachern; however, the Harts were not included in the settlement and became the only remaining defendants.[4]Â Â Â  \r\nThe arbitrator thereafter issued decisions awarding both actual and punitive damages to the Gissels and McEachern.[5]Â  The arbitrator awarded the Gissels $55,000.00 in â€œactual, consequential and incidental damagesâ€ against the Harts â€œjointly and severally,â€ $45,000.00 in punitive damages against Charles Hart â€œindividually,â€ and $45,000.00 in punitive damages against Gene Hart â€œindividually.â€Â  In a separate ruling, the arbitrator awarded McEachern $53,000.00 in actual damages against the Harts â€œjointly and severally,â€ $45,000.00 in punitive damages against Charles Hart â€œindividually,â€ and $45,000.00 in punitive damages against Gene Hart â€œindividually.â€Â  \r\nThe Harts appealed to the circuit court, which upheld the arbitratorâ€™s awards.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Harts contend the decision of the arbitrator should be vacated because the arbitrator exceeded his powers in entering awards against them individually and his decision constituted a manifest disregard of the law.\r\nâ€œThe policy of the United States and South Carolina is to favor arbitration of disputes.â€[6]Â  â€œIn order to advance the underlying purposes of arbitration, the scope of judicial review is necessarily restricted.â€[7]Â  \r\nSection 10(a) of the FAA provides that an arbitration award may be vacated[8] on four statutory grounds:\r\n\r\n(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; \r\n(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; \r\n(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or \r\n(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.[9]\r\n\r\nThe Harts acknowledge there was no fraud, partiality, or corruption in this case, but contend the arbitrator exceeded his powers.Â  â€œArbitrators exceed their\r\npowers within the meaning of Â§ 10(a)(4) of the FAA where their award resolves an issue that is not\r\narbitrable because it is outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.â€[10]Â  \r\nThe Harts also contend the award constitutes a manifest disregard of the law.Â  â€œAn\r\narbitratorâ€™s award may be vacated where there has been a â€˜manifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the\r\nlaw.â€™ â€[11]Â  â€œHowever, this non-statutory ground requires something more than a mere error of\r\nlaw, or failure on the part of the arbitrator to understand or apply the law.â€[12]Â  It presupposes something beyond a mere error in construing or applying the\r\nlaw and even a clearly erroneous interpretation of the contract cannot be disturbed.[13]Â  \r\nAt the hearing before the circuit court, the Harts contended the arbitrator exceeded his powers by awarding damages against them â€œindividuallyâ€ and the awards constituted a manifest disregard of the law.Â  The Harts asserted the amended complaints stated that â€œat all times herein mentionedâ€ the Harts were â€œacting as agents, servants, and employees.â€[14]Â  They further asserted the complaints contained no factual allegations of any wrongdoing by them in their individual capacities.Â  The circuit court, in colloquy from the bench, noted that, â€œYouâ€™ve got to give some credence to the fact that they are named separately and that they are referred to collectively as defendants.â€Â  The circuit court ruled from the bench that the arbitratorâ€™s awards should be upheld, and subsequently issued a short form order summarily denying the motion to vacate the awards.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Harts argue that the award of damages, both actual and punitive, against them should be vacated because they were not sued in their individual capacities.Â  The Harts assert:Â  â€œThe arbitratorâ€™s decision contains no specific findings of fact or conclusions of law.Â  It is therefore impossible to actually pinpoint the basis for his conclusion that each of the individuals named as Defendants in this case [is] Â liable for . . . actual damages and . . . punitive damages.Â  This decision is clearly beyond both the arbitratorâ€™s authority and power, and made with manifest disregard for the law.â€Â  \r\nâ€œThe character in which one is made a party to a suit must be determined from the allegations of the pleadings, and not from the title alone.â€[15]Â  â€œWhere the allegations of the complaint indicate with reasonable certainty that a plaintiff sues, or a defendant is sued, in a representative capacity, although not specifically stated, this is sufficient to fix the character of the suit.â€[16]Â  â€œWhere it is doubtful in what capacity a party sues or is sued, the entire complaint must be examined to determine the question, and reference may also be had to the pleadings as a whole or to the entire record.â€[17]Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œIf the complaint is unclear on this issue [of whether a defendant is being sued in an official or representative capacity or whether the defendant is being sued in an individual capacity], . . . courts will look to the caption of the case, the allegations of the complaint, and the prayer for relief to ascertain the capacity in which the defendant has been sued.â€[18]Â  \r\nâ€œ[T]he statement of capacity in the caption, the allegations, and the prayer for relief allow defendants to have an opportunity to prepare for a proper defense and eliminate the unnecessary litigation that arises when parties fail to specify the capacity.â€[19]Â  â€œIn the absence of a clear statement of [a] defendantâ€™s capacity, a plaintiff is deemed to have sued a defendant in his official capacity.â€[20]Â  \r\nWe agree with the Harts that the complaints did not clearly assert claims against them in their individual capacities.Â  The fact that they were listed as defendants in the captions of the complaints is not determinative of what capacity they were being sued in, and even the captions did not expressly state that they were each being sued in an individual, as opposed to representative, capacity.Â  In addition, the factual allegations in the body of the complaints specifically alleged the Harts were acting â€œat all timesâ€ as agents and employees of the defendant corporation, Homes America, Inc. Â None of the allegations stated the Harts committed any acts in their individual capacities or that relief was sought against them other than as agents and employees of the corporation.[21]Â  We note that an allegation of joint and several liability is a distinct concept that refers to the allocation of any damages award, not to whether the defendants are sued in a representative or individual capacity.[22]Â  Moreover, in the request for relief, the complaints essentially sought one recovery against all of the defendants on the various causes of action.[23]Â Â Â  \r\nIn this case, the contracts signed by the Gissels and McEachern were with Homes America (now Southern Showcase Housing).Â  The contracts were each in the name of the corporation Homes America, which was listed as â€œDEALER,â€ and signed â€œByâ€ Gene Hart as a signatory for the corporation.Â  Gene Hart was not listed as signing in an individual capacity on the contract.Â  Additionally, Customer Pre-Delivery and Set-Up Agreements were signed â€œBY MANAGERâ€ Gene Hart indicating he was signing on behalf of Homes America.Â  Charles Hart was not a signatory to any of the contracts.Â  Thus, there was no basis on which to predicate an award of individual liability.[24]Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we vacate the portions of the arbitratorâ€™s awards that purport to impose liability â€œindividuallyâ€ on the Harts for punitive damages and, if the awards can be read to impose liability â€œindividuallyâ€ on the Harts for actual damages, for actual damages as well.&nbsp; We affirm the awards, however, to the extent that they impose actual damages against the Harts in their representative capacities as agents, servants, and employees of Homes America, the capacities in which they were sued.\r\n VACATED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.[25]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The following notice appeared in bold typeface in the contracts â€“ â€œNOTICE OF ARBITRATION PROVISION:Â  THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS A BINDING AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES AND CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT.â€Â  \r\n[2]Â  9 U.S.C.A.

Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440 (2006) (citing the sections constituting the FAA).Â  The FAA applies to maritime transactions and to transactions involving interstate commerce.Â  9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1 (West 1999).Â  The orders compelling arbitration note the transactions at issue here involved interstate commerce because the Gissels and McEachern are residents of South Carolina, Southern Showcase Housing is a North Carolina corporation, and the homes were manufactured by a Delaware corporation that was not named in the suits.Â  In this case, it is not questioned that the transactions involved interstate commerce, and the applicability of the federal act has been established as the law of the case.Â  See Trident Technical College v. Lucas &amp; Stubbs, Ltd.,&nbsp;286 S.C. 98, 104 n.2, 333 S.E.2d 781, 785 n.2&nbsp;(1985).\r\n[3]Â  The orders of reference in this case state the litigation is being referred pursuant to the motions of Southern Showcase Housing without specifically noting the Harts had also moved for the matters to be arbitrated.Â  During the oral argument for this appeal, counsel for all parties agreed that the orders referred both the Gisselsâ€™ case and McEachernâ€™s case to arbitration in their entirety and encompassed the claims against the corporation and the Harts.Â  Indeed, this is the only reasonable interpretation in light of the fact that the motions of Southern Showcase Housing and the Harts asked for identical relief, i.e., arbitration, and they received the relief they asked for.Â  The failure of the order to note the Harts had made identical motions on this point was, at most, the result of a clerical mistake.\r\n[4]Â  Amery English did not appear at the hearing on the motions to compel arbitration, was not mentioned in the arbitration awards, and is not a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Since Southern Showcase Housing had settled with the plaintiffs, it was not a named party in the awards and the Harts were the only named defendants. \r\n[6] Â Zabinski v.

Sechrest, 495 S.E.2d 721, 723-25 (N.C. 1998) (stating the pleadings should clearly indicate in the caption the capacity in which the plaintiff intends to hold a defendant liable, and it should be further indicated in the allegations of the complaint and in the prayer for relief; the court observed that in the absence of such a clear statement, there is a presumption against imposing individual liability; the court noted the fact that there was only one claim for relief against the defendants was indicative of an intent to sue one of the listed defendants in an official capacity as an agent rather than in an individual capacity).\r\n[24] Cf. McKagen v. Windham, 59 S.C. 434, 38 S.E. 2 (1901) (reversing a judgment in favor of the plaintiff who was suing the members of a county board of control on a contract for wages, where the complaint did not allege that the defendants intended to bind themselves personally on the contract, nor did the plaintiff allege facts from which such an inference could be drawn; it is presumed that the members did not intend to bind themselves personally to a contract made by them on behalf of the county).Â  Courts must look to the entire complaint to ascertain the capacity in which a defendant is sued.Â  See, e.g., Johnson v. York, 517 S.E.2d 670, 672-73 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999) (holding, where the plaintiffâ€™s complaint contained no clear statement in the caption, the allegations, or the prayer for relief that the defendants were being sued in their individual capacities, the court would treat the complaint as a suit against the defendants solely in their official capacities; the plaintiff had alleged the two defendants were employees of the Department of Corrections and one was the plaintiffâ€™s colleague and the other an area administrator); Warren v. Guilford County, 500 S.E.2d 470, 471-72 (N.C. Ct. App. 1998) (treating the complaint as being against the defendant Ann Kelk in her official capacity where â€œneither the caption, the allegations, nor the prayer for relief contains any reference as to whether Kelk is being sued in her official or individual capacityâ€; the plaintiff alleged Kelk â€œwas an agent and employee of the Defendant Guilford Mental Healthâ€ and operating â€œas an agent and employeeâ€ and sought judgment against the defendants â€œjointly and severallyâ€). \r\n[25] The Harts additionally argue on appeal that (1) the award of punitive damages is outside the scope of the arbitration agreement because the â€œcontract expressly bars the consideration of damages in excess of those determined to have been the actual damage caused by the sellerâ€™s failure to repair the mobile home,â€ and (2) the award of punitive damages evidences a manifest disregard of the law because there was no examination of the Harts individually, there was no individual allegations asserted against them, and there was no testimony regarding the individual liability of the Harts.Â  These issues, however, were not preserved for appeal as they were not argued below.Â  See Murphy v. Hagan,&nbsp;275 S.C. 334, 339, 271 S.E.2d 311, 313&nbsp;(1980) (â€œThe remaining issues were either not raised below and therefore may not be raised on review or were not properly preserved by timely exception and therefore may not be heard on appeal.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4225","title":"Marlar v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Christopher L. Newton, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Anthony Marlar was convicted of first-degree burglary and first-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  His petition for post-conviction relief (PCR) was denied.Â  This court granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief.Â  We vacate and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early morning hours of February 23, 1993, two men with stockings covering their faces broke into the victimâ€™s home.Â  The victimâ€™s three-year-old daughter was sleeping in the bed with her at the time.Â  The victim heard the short, stocky male tell the tall, slim male, â€œTony, get the girl out of here.â€Â  The tall, slim male replied, â€œOh, sh--,â€ when the name â€œTonyâ€ was used.Â  â€œTonyâ€ took the child out of the room and returned.Â  The short, stocky male asked â€œTony,â€ â€œIs this her?â€Â  After â€œTonyâ€ nodded his head in assent, the two men held a knife to victim and took turns raping her.Â  When they finished, they cleaned the victim and threatened her before leaving.Â  \r\nThe victim went to the hospital, and a rape kit was performed.Â  The victim told hospital personnel and police that both males ejaculated during the crime.Â  She told police that she believed the two males were brothers Bobby Marlar and Anthony â€œTonyâ€ Marlar, because of their build.Â  The Marlar brothers were in her house the prior week to help her roommate, whom Bobby Marlar was dating, move out of the house.Â  The victim did not recognize the voices of the perpetrators.Â  Although both Bobby and Tony Marlar were briefly interviewed, the criminal investigation did not progress for several years.Â  \r\nIn 1996, the investigation was reopened.Â  In March 1996, police questioned Jerry Fields, who denied participating in the crime and indicated that he was with Tony Marlar (â€œMarlarâ€) that evening.Â  After DNA collected from the victim matched Fields, he eventually confessed and implicated Marlar as the second suspect.Â  Fields agreed to plead guilty and to testify at Marlarâ€™s trial in exchange for a twenty-year sentence.Â  There was no DNA evidence linking Marlar to the crime, and two pubic hairs found in the bed did not match Fields, the victim, the victimâ€™s boyfriend, or Marlar. Â Prior to the DNA results linking Fields, Marlar was questioned by police and he stated he could not recall where he was three years earlier on the night of the crime.Â  Marlar also denied any involvement in the crime and indicated that he probably was with Fields that night.Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, the victim testified that she was absolutely sure that the tall, slim rapist was Marlar because:Â  (1) of his build; (2) Fields referred to the second rapist as â€œTony;â€ and (3) the second rapist was familiar with her house and knew the telephone in her bedroom did not work.Â  Unlike her initial statement, the victim testified at trial that the second rapist did not ejaculate, explaining the lack of DNA evidence linking Marlar.Â  Fields testified that he had also been in the victimâ€™s house, when the victim was not there, to help Bobby Marlar move out his girlfriend prior to the rape.Â  Fields stated that he and Marlar raped the victim, and he denied having any disagreement with Marlar or any other motivation to testify against him.Â  Marlar did not testify and no evidence was presented in his defense.Â  He was convicted and sentenced to a total of forty-four years.Â  \r\nMarlar filed an application for PCR.Â  In his application, Marlar insinuated that Fields and Fieldsâ€™ brother, â€œTerry,â€ who were both in prison for burglaries they committed together, were the actual rapists.Â  He alleged counsel was ineffective for, among other reasons, failing to cross-examine Fields about his motivation to implicate Marlar because Marlar swore out a warrant against Fields in 1994 for damaging Marlarâ€™s truck.Â  Marlar also alleged that counsel was ineffective for failing to present the exculpatory hair evidence and in not allowing him to testify in his own defense.Â  \r\nCounsel testified at the PCR hearing that he did not recall whether Marlar informed him about the warrant taken out against Fields.Â  Counsel stated he did not think Marlar would hold up well on cross-examination by the State.Â  Counsel also stated that he did not subpoena the SLED agent who examined the pubic hairs or present the pubic hair evidence because there was no other DNA evidence linking Marlar to the crime, and he did not want to present any evidence because he did not want to lose the right to last closing argument.Â  Counsel stated that he did not think having the SLED agent to testify regarding the pubic hairs would change anything.Â  The SLED agent who tested the pubic hairs stated at the PCR hearing that if he had been called to testify at the trial, he would have testified that the hairs did not match Marlar, Fields, the victim, or the victimâ€™s boyfriend.Â  Finally, Marlar testified that counsel never discussed the pubic hairs with him, counsel merely informed him that the DNA evidence did not match.Â  Marlar also stated counsel told him not to testify, despite Marlarâ€™s desire to do so, because he would lose the last argument.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the PCR court denied relief and dismissed the petition.Â  The court found counsel rendered â€œreasonably effective assistance under the prevailing professional norms and demonstrated a normal degree of skill, knowledge and professional judgment that is expected of an attorney who practices criminal law.â€Â  As to the specific issues raised in the PCR application, the court held:Â  â€œAs to any allegations raised in the application or at the hearing not specifically addressed by this Order, this Court finds that the applicant failed to present any evidence regarding such allegations.Â  Accordingly, this Court finds that the applicant failed to meet his burden of proof regarding them.â€Â  This petition for certiorari followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThis Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on appeal if there is â€œany evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.â€Â  Id.Â  The appellate court must reverse where there is no probative evidence to support the findings.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMarlar argues the PCR courtâ€™s order was inadequate and should be remanded for specific findings of fact.Â  We agree.\r\nA PCR court â€œshall make specific findings of fact, and state expressly its conclusions of law, relating to each issue presented.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003).Â  PCR courts have been repeatedly admonished regarding the failure to specifically rule on the issues presented in a PCR application.Â  See Bryson v. State, 328 S.C. 236, 236-37, 493 S.E.2d 500, 500 (1997) (vacating a PCR order and remanding the matter for specific findings of fact and conclusions of law); McCullough v. State, 320 S.C. 270, 272, 464 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1995); Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. 254, 255, 423 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1992) (vacating and remanding PCR order dismissing the action where the PCR court failed to address the issues raised in the application); see also Garner v. State, 371 S.C. 1, 1, 626 S.E.2d 860, 860 (2006) (emphasizing language in section 17-27-80 that specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding each issue presented must be made by the PCR court).Â  Â \r\nCiting Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 548 S.E.2d 862 (2001), the State argues that any complaint regarding the sufficiency of the order is not preserved for review because Marlar did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion requesting the PCR court to specifically address each issue raised in the application.Â  In the past, our state supreme court has overlooked the failure to file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion in order to attend to the pervasive problem of inadequate orders.Â  McCullough, 320 S.C. at 272, 464 S.E.2d at 341 (remanding matter to PCR court, despite the fact that no Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion had been filed, and admonishing all those involved to carefully prepare and review PCR orders to ensure they specifically address the issues raised and make conclusions of law); Pruitt, 310 S.C. at 255, 423 S.E.2d at 128 (vacating and remanding the PCR courtâ€™s order, despite the fact that no Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion was filed, to address the failure of many PCR orders to address all the issues raised).Â  In the more recent case of Humbert, the court did not overlook the failure to file a Rule 59(e) motion to preserve one issue not specifically addressed in the PCR order.Â  Humbert, 345 S.C. at 337, 548 S.E.2d at 865 (finding that, although the PCR court addressed the issue of whether it was ineffective assistance of counsel to allow the petitioner to wear the jail jumpsuit during his trial, the issue of whether it was ineffective assistance for trial counsel to allow petitioner to proceed to trial wearing shackles and a jail identification bracelet was not preserved because the PCR courtâ€™s order did not address it and no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was filed).Â  It does not appear that Humbert overruled the prior cases, and it is not clear whether, in light of Humbert, an appellate court may still take the extraordinary action of overlooking the failure to file a Rule 59(e) motion and remanding matters so that specific orders may be issued by the PCR court.Â  What is clear, however, is that the problem of PCR orders that do not address each issue raised by an applicant continues to permeate our judicial system.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn any event, we do not believe that we need to take any extraordinary action in this case because we believe the issue is preserved.Â  The PCR courtâ€™s order specifically acknowledged that some issues were not addressed.Â  The court made the finding that, as to those issues, no evidence was presented.Â  When, as here, the PCR courtâ€™s order specifically addresses its failure to delineate each issue and gives reasons for the ruling, the issue has been finally ruled upon by the lower court and is preserved for appeal.Â  \r\nAs to the merits of the PCR courtâ€™s ruling, Marlar presented evidence to support his claims.Â  Accordingly, there is no evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that he failed to present any evidence.Â  We must vacate the order and remand the matter for a new PCR hearing.Â  We caution the PCR court on remand to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law as to each issue raised in Marlarâ€™s PCR application.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons outlined above, the PCR courtâ€™s decision denying relief is \r\nVACATED and REMANDED for a new hearing.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and SHORT, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4226","title":"Patricia Grand Hotel v.

Â The parties could not resolve the dispute, and on October 23, 2003, Patricia Grand filed both an eviction action in magistrate court to evict MacGuire from the pool bar and an action for civil damages in circuit court under the theories of trespass, breach of contract, quantum meruit, conversion, and injunction.Â  MacGuireâ€™s motion to have the eviction action transferred from the magistrate court to the circuit was granted, and the eviction action and the damages action were consolidated.Â  Â Â \r\nPrior to the jury trial, the parties informed the circuit court that they had reached a settlement agreement wherein the lease would be amended to reflect that it â€œincludes the pool bar under the demise [sic] premises,â€ that the rent would increase to $3,300, and that MacGuire could increase some prices on golf and meal packages. Â MacGuireâ€™s attorney then informed the circuit court that â€œ[t]here are a number of outstanding issues, your honor, that constitute the atmospherics between the parties and thatâ€™s what made discussions up to this point difficult,â€ but that the parties had quickly agreed on the main issue.Â  MacGuireâ€™s attorney noted that the parties had â€œagreed to cooperate in good faith on the number of issues that are still remaining,â€ and he pointed out that Patricia Grand was operating an Icee machine near the pool bar.Â  Patricia Grand agreed that the Icee operation would cease.Â  The agreement was put on the record and the court approved it.Â  Further, the court ordered the parties to put the agreement in writing and have it signed by all the parties.Â  \r\nThe parties were unable to agree on the wording of the written agreement.Â  Patricia Grand alleged the partiesâ€™ agreement only dealt with its sale of Icees at the pool bar and MacGuireâ€™s sale of food and beverages at the â€œdemised property,â€ including the pool bar, the restaurant, and the lounge.Â  MacGuire believed the agreement not only resolved the pool bar issue but also provided that Patricia Grand agreed not to compete in any food or beverage sales â€œon site,â€ or at any location on the entire hotel property.Â  At the hearing to determine the terms of the settlement agreement, the circuit court reviewed the portion of the transcript where the parties outlined the settlement agreement and heard arguments from both counsels.Â  The court determined that the parties were only discussing competition in the form of Icee sales at the pool bar, part of the â€œdemised premises.â€Â  After the hearing, the circuit court signed an order â€œEnding Action &amp; Amending Lease,â€ which, in addition to amending the lease to demise the pool bar area to MacGuire, provided that Patricia Grand agreed not to sell â€œany food or beverage on the demised premises and will not sell, or franchise to any entity the right to sell, any frozen drink commonly referred to as an â€˜Icee.â€™â€Â  The circuit court denied MacGuireâ€™s motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis appeal revolves around the specific terms of the partiesâ€™ modified lease agreement, and thus, the matter sounds in contract.Â  Generally, an action to construe a contract is one at law. Â See Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 146, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that an action to construe an unambiguous written contract is one at law).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, this court is limited merely to the correction of errors of law and the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Meeting of the minds\r\nMacGuire argues there was no meeting of the minds with respect to the terms of the settlement agreement.Â  Thus, it argues, there was no settlement agreement and the circuit court should have resumed the trial of the case.Â  \r\nâ€œSouth Carolina common law requires that, in order to have a valid and enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.â€Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989).Â  MacGuire points to the Fourth Circuit Case of Ozyagcilar v. Davis, 701 F.2d 306 (4th Cir. 1983), for the proposition that courts do not have the power to impose a settlement agreement where there was not a meeting of the minds between the parties.Â  In Ozyagcilar, a student at the University of South Carolina sued the University over patent rights to a new chemical process the student claimed to have invented.Â  Just prior to trial, the parties informed the court that they had reached an agreement, an outline of their agreement was made part of the record, and the case was dismissed with prejudice.Â  The studentâ€™s attorney informed the court that if a dispute arose as to the terms and meaning of the agreement, the court would resolve the matter.Â  When the parties attempted to draft a formal settlement, the parties disputed the meaning of a clause in the outline.Â  After reviewing briefs and affidavits and without a hearing, the district court issued an order interpreting the agreement, despite the studentâ€™s argument that there had not been a meeting of the minds.Â  \r\nThe Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded the matter.Â  The court noted that although the district court had the power to enforce complete settlement agreements, â€œit does not have the power to impose, in the role of arbiter, a settlement agreement where there was never a meeting of the partiesâ€™ minds.â€Â  Ozyagcilar, 701 F.2d at 308. Â The court noted that â€œ[w]here there has been no meeting of the minds sufficient to form a complete settlement agreement, any partial performance of the settlement agreement must be rescinded and the case restored to the docket for trial.â€Â  Id.Â  The Fourth Circuit found the district court erred by not conducting a hearing to determine whether there had been a meeting of the minds as to the settlement agreement, and if so, to determine the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThis issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Although MacGuire moved the court to reconsider its order, his motion requested that the court change the order to include a covenant for Patricia Grand not to compete on the entire hotel property.Â  MacGuire did not argue that since the parties differed in their interpretation of the settlement agreement, then there was no meeting of the minds and the trial of the matter should proceed.Â  Whether or not proceeding to trial would have been the appropriate thing to do, MacGuire did not request it and the circuit court did not rule upon it.Â  Thus, it is not a matter that is appropriate for our review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review).Â  Further, the present case differs from Ozyagcilar in that the circuit court actually had a hearing to determine whether a settlement agreement existed and to determine the terms of the agreement.Â  \r\nNevertheless, because MacGuire did not preserve the issue of whether the circuit court should have rescinded the agreement and proceeded to trial, we decline to address it. \r\nII.Â  Terms of the settlement agreement\r\nMacGuire argues the circuit court erred in finding the partiesâ€™ agreement only concerned the sale of food and beverages at the pool bar, restaurant, and lounge.Â  MacGuire argues the words used at the hearing were clear and unambiguous that the agreement concerned the hotel â€œsite,â€ and thus the parties agreed that Patrica Grand would not sell food or beverages anywhere on the hotel property.Â  In the alternative, MacGuire argues that should the terms of the agreement be considered ambiguous, then it should be interpreted in MacGuireâ€™s favor.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs previously stated, the circuit courtâ€™s role in determining the actual terms of the settlement agreement between the parties is similar to the courtâ€™s role in interpreting the terms of a contract.Â  In interpreting contracts, the court should ascertain and give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions.Â  Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 30, 586 S.E.2d 861, 864 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œThe main guide in contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the language of the lease.â€).Â  Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the court must construe the contract according to the terms the parties used as understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  \r\nThus, â€œwhere an agreement is clear and capable of legal construction, the courts [sic] only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found within the agreement.â€Â  Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C. 614, 628, 598 S.E.2d 310, 317 (Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œIn the enforcement of an agreement, the court does not have the authority to modify terms that are clear and unambiguous on their face.â€Â  Id. at 621, 598 S.E.2d at 314; Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  However, where â€œthe language of a settlement agreement is susceptible of more than one interpretation, it is the duty of the court to ascertain the intentions of the parties.â€Â  Mattox v. Cassady, 289 S.C. 57, 60, 344 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nAt trial, the parties announced that they had reached a settlement agreement.Â  The following exhange took place:\r\n\r\n[MacGuireâ€™s attorney]:Â  Now my client is in food sales, obviously, food and beverage.Â  Thereâ€™s the problem that theyâ€™ve been experiencing is competition and its our understanding that the agreement is is [sic] that [Patricia Grand] will not sell any food on site and that they will not compete with the Icee sales. \r\n[Court]:Â  What is that?\r\n[MacGuireâ€™s attorney]:Â  The Icee; they have a frozen drink ice cream machine right outside of the pool bar window.\r\n[Patricia Grandâ€™s attorney]:Â  The Icee operation will cease, your honor.\r\n. . .\r\n[Court]:Â  Now if for some, now just so that the courtâ€™s clear, what youâ€™re talking about is the current operations of both sides as far as what your client operates and does currently the competition might cease but obviously your client is not then seeking to include that in automatically in his operation?\r\n[MacGuireâ€™s attorney]:Â  Iâ€™m sorry, include â€“\r\n[Court]:Â  The Icee or whatever it is that you thought was competition.Â  If itâ€™s not already being done itâ€™s not something to be done in the future without the parties agreeing to it.Â  What your client can do now is what he is doing now â€“ \r\n[MacGuireâ€™s attorney]:Â  Right.\r\n[Court]:Â  -- not in addition to that.Â  So if some operation is being ceased on one side the other side canâ€™t automatically just pick that up and start doing it without agreement of both parties just so that weâ€™re clear about that because I donâ€™t want us coming back next week or some other time about this, all right.\r\n[MacGuireâ€™s attorney]:Â  And let me just say for the record just so that we are clear on that, my client has always engaged in the sale of the Icees. \r\n[Court]:Â  All right, but what Iâ€™m saying is what the parties as I understand the parties agreement he can do what heâ€™s doing now, not anything new;Â  anything new would be based on further discussions, if necessary.\r\n[MacGuireâ€™s attorney]:Â  Yes, sir . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nMacGuire points to its attorneyâ€™s use of the word â€œon siteâ€ in the hearing before the circuit court to support its argument that the agreement was for Patricia Grand not to compete in food and beverage sales on the entire hotel property.Â  Patricia Grand argues the entire purpose of the hearing was to deal with food and beverage sales at the pool bar, and it is clear from the hearing transcript that the pool bar and Icee sales at the pool bar were the only issues discussed.Â  \r\nWe agree with Patricia Grand.Â  Although MacGuireâ€™s attorney informed the circuit court that the parties agreed that Patricia Grand would cease selling food â€œon site,â€ this statement was made in the context of its complaint that Patricia Grand was selling Icees in direct competition at the pool bar.Â  The parties discussed that the agreement would be that MacGuire would be exclusively selling food and beverages at the pool bar and that the competing sale of Icees by Patricia Grand would cease.Â  The court clarified that the Icee sales would cease by Patricia Grand and that MacGuire could continue doing what it had done in the past, i.e., sell food and beverages at the pool bar, restaurant, and lounge.Â  The court went on to say that MacGuire could not â€œdo anything new.â€Â  \r\nConsidering the plain meaning of the words the parties used at the time of the hearing, it appears the parties had a meeting of the minds and that the agreement only related to the lease of the pool bar and the cessation of Icee sales at the pool bar.Â  No mention was made of complete ban of food or beverage sales from the entire hotel property.Â  \r\nFurther, even if one looks to the isolated use of the words â€œon siteâ€ as creating an ambiguity in the agreement, we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the agreement.Â  The court reviewed the transcript of the hearing wherein the parties outlined the agreement, and the court ascertained that the parties were only focusing on competing sales at the pool bar and the Icee sales.Â  We find no error with this interpretation of the agreement based on the partiesâ€™ expressed intentions at the hearing. Â Mattox, 289 S.C. at 60, 344 S.E.2d at 622 (noting that the court has a duty to ascertain the intent of the parties when the language of a settlement agreement is susceptible of more than one interpretaion).\r\nThus, we find no error with the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of the agreement to forbid Patricia Grand from selling food and beverages only at the demised locations of the pool bar, restaurant, and lounge.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order documenting the agreement of the parties is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The lease with Huffman Investments was with the predecessor in interest to Patricia Grand, Patricia Grand, A South Carolina Limited Partnership.Â Â  Patricia Grand purchased the hotel and became the lessor of the restaurant thereafter.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
