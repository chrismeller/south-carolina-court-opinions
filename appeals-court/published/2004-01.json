Jackson Kimball, III, of Rock Hill; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:Â  In this action to foreclose \r\n  a mechanicâ€™s lien, the master ordered judgment against Phillip and Virginia \r\n  Randazzo in the amount of $50,846.00, and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees to Zepsa in \r\n  the amount of $8,123.40.Â  The Randazzos appeal, arguing the master erred in:Â  \r\n  (1) including lost profits and overhead in the amount of the mechanicâ€™s lien; \r\n  and (2) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Zepsa.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nPhillip and Virginia Randazzo (collectively, \r\n  â€œRandazzosâ€), owned and operated an Italian restaurant near Tega Cay Village \r\n  Shopping Center in Fort Mill, South Carolina.Â  In September 1996, they contacted \r\n  Ed Zepsa, president of Zepsa Construction, Inc. (â€œZepsaâ€) to inquire about the \r\n  design and construction of a new restaurant.Â  After several months of discussions \r\n  and negotiations, the parties entered into on May 14, 1997, a written construction \r\n  contract for Zepsa to build the restaurant.Â  The agreed price was $610,000.00.Â  \r\n  The terms of the contract required a deposit in the amount of $61,000.00 to \r\n  be paid when the contract was signed.Â  \r\nOn May 29, 1997, the Randazzos gave written \r\n  â€œnotice to proceedâ€ with construction.Â  At that time, they provided Zepsa with \r\n  a check for $21,000.00, representing part of the agreed deposit.Â  Zepsa did \r\n  not begin work at this time because the Randazzos had not paid the full deposit.Â  \r\n  By letter dated July 1, 1997, Zepsa agreed to accept the remainder of the deposit \r\n  in two installments.Â  These installments were to be paid at the time of the \r\n  first two payment requests after construction began. Â Zepsa began work on the \r\n  site on July 7, 1997.Â  Between July 15 and August 2, 1997, Virginia Randazzo \r\n  (Virginia) spoke by phone with either Ed Zepsa or the project manager on four \r\n  occasions.Â  During these conversations, she asked about terminating the contract \r\n  due to the Randazzosâ€™ marital problems, instructed Zepsa to stop work, and told \r\n  Zepsa to continue to delay construction while the Randazzos tried to resolve \r\n  their marital difficulties.Â  On August 3, Virginia called Ed Zepsa and told \r\n  him she did not want to continue with the project.Â  \r\nOn August 4, the Randazzos contacted Ed \r\n  Zepsa and instructed him to proceed with construction.Â  In response, he submitted \r\n  a payment request seeking payment of $8,674.00 for work that had been performed \r\n  and $40,000.00 for the balance of the deposit.Â  Also on August 4, Zepsa received \r\n  a letter from the Randazzosâ€™ attorney requesting that Zepsa abide by the deposit \r\n  payment schedule and proceed with the work.Â  Zepsa resumed work on the project.Â  \r\n  Â Â \r\nOn August 11, Zepsa submitted a payment \r\n  request for work performed through July and included a request for the next \r\n  deposit installment. Â No payment was made for this completed work or the deposit \r\n  installments.Â  By letter dated August 28, 1997, the Randazzosâ€™ attorney gave \r\n  notice of termination of the contract. Â Â Â Â \r\nZepsa timely filed a lis pendens and complaint \r\n  on October 16, 1997.Â  The complaint sought judgment against the Randazzos and \r\n  foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien that Zepsa had previously filed and served.Â  \r\n  The matter was referred with finality to the master.Â  At the hearing, Zepsa \r\n  presented uncontested evidence that Zepsa performed construction work on the \r\n  job site in the amount of $10,846.00. Â In his order dated January 22, 2001, \r\n  the master granted Zepsa judgment against the Randazzos in the amount of $50,846.00, \r\n  which included the unpaid balance for work already performed and payment for \r\n  the remaining deposit balance of $40,000.00.Â  By order dated March 22, 2001, \r\n  the master awarded Zepsa attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $8,123.40, and costs \r\n  in the amount of $1,490.60.Â  The Randazzos appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien is a law case in \r\n  South Carolina.â€Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri, 345 S.C. \r\n  550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œIn an action at law, tried \r\n  without a jury, the judgeâ€™s findings will not be disturbed unless they are without \r\n  evidentiary support.â€Â  King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388, \r\n  453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).Â  â€œHis findings are equivalent to those of a jury \r\n  in an action at law.â€Â  Id. at 389, 453 S.E.2d at 888.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Mechanicâ€™s Lien\r\nThe Randazzos argue the master erred by including \r\n  lost profits in the amount of the mechanicâ€™s lien when only a small portion \r\n  of the contract work was actually performed.Â Â Â  \r\nSection 29-5-10 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code of Laws defines a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (1991 &amp; \r\n  Supp. 2002). [1] Â  This section \r\n  provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(a) A person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or \r\n  furnished or for materials furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, \r\n  or repair of a building or structure upon real estate or the boring and equipping \r\n  of wells, by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of the \r\n  building or structure, or a person having authority from, or rightfully acting \r\n  for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall have \r\n  a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of \r\n  the building or structure in the lot of land upon which it is situated to secure \r\n  the payment of the debt due to him.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (1991).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the master granted a judgment \r\n  against the Randazzos in the amount of $50,846.00 based on two grounds.Â  First, \r\n  the master found Zepsaâ€™s lost profits and overhead expenses were recoverable \r\n  as an element of damages for the Randazzosâ€™ breach of the construction contract.Â  \r\n  Secondly, the master concluded â€œthese elements of damage [were also] recoverable \r\n  in a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure action.â€ Â The master reasoned:\r\n\r\nSince Zepsa is entitled to profits and overhead expenses, \r\n  there is a reasonable and equitable basis for claiming the balance of the deposit \r\n  as an integral part of the payment due under the contract, unrelated to actual \r\n  work performed.Â  Thus, Zepsa is entitled to be paid the balance of the deposit \r\n  due, along with the balance due for work which was performed.\r\n\r\nGiven Zepsaâ€™s recovery in its mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien action is limited to that as provided for in the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, \r\n  the question becomes whether the overhead expenses and lost profits were lienable \r\n  items.Â  In concluding these items were recoverable under a mechanicâ€™s lien, \r\n  the master relied on our Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Sentry Engâ€™g &amp; Constr., \r\n  Inc. v. Marinerâ€™s Cay Dev. Corp., 287 S.C. 346, 338 S.E.2d 631 (1985).Â  \r\n  In Sentry, a builder, Sentry, and a developer executed two separate agreements \r\n  for the construction of a condominium.Â  The first agreement provided for the \r\n  cost of the construction and the second provided for the additional compensation \r\n  of overhead and profit.Â  As the project neared completion, Sentry filed a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien for balances due under both agreements and change orders.Â  Sentry exercised \r\n  its right to arbitration and filed a claim in the amount of its mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\n  Sentry later amended its arbitration demand to include claims for damages for \r\n  wrongful termination of the construction contract.Â  The American Arbitration \r\n  Association (AAA) found Sentry was entitled to $503,271.00.Â  The circuit court \r\n  adopted the AAAâ€™s award as a judgment, granted Sentry summary judgment on its \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure petition, assessed interest, and awarded Sentry \r\n  attorney fees.\r\nOn appeal, the developer raised several \r\n  issues, including the assertion the circuit court judge erred in holding that \r\n  profit and overhead were components of â€œdebtâ€ under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute. \r\n  Id. at 349, 338 S.E.2d 633.Â  Our Supreme Court rejected the developerâ€™s \r\n  argument.Â  The Court held â€œthat overhead and profit, when stated as part of \r\n  the contract price, are proper components of a mechanicâ€™s lien.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 352, 338 S.E.2d at 635.Â  The Court found that â€œâ€˜[s]uch items, as such and \r\n  standing by themselves, are nonlienable, but they become lienable when they \r\n  are included in a contract price or are reflected in the reasonable value of \r\n  labor or materials furnished.â€™â€ Id. at 352, 338 S.E.2d at 634 (quoting \r\n  53 Am. Jur. 2d Mechanicsâ€™ Liens Â§ 107 (1970)).\r\nBased on our reading of Sentry, \r\n  we believe the Supreme Court expanded the items that are recoverable under the \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien statute to include overhead and profit.Â  However, this holding \r\n  is only available in the limited situation where the terms of overhead and profit \r\n  are agreed upon by the parties and are subsequently embodied within a contract.\r\nIn view of the specific facts of the instant \r\n  case, Sentry is inapplicable for several reasons.Â  Significantly, the \r\n  parties in Sentry entered into a separate agreement that specifically \r\n  provided for the recovery of overhead and profit.Â  In contrast, Zepsa and the \r\n  Randazzos did not execute an agreement providing for overhead and profit.Â  Their \r\n  contract is silent concerning these items.Â  Even though Ed Zepsa testified the \r\n  deposit constituted compensation for pre-construction or â€œup frontâ€ work, his \r\n  testimony is not determinative of the agreed upon terms of the contract.Â  There \r\n  is no evidence the parties agreed to pay $61,000.00 as an upfront cost.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the account statement of the contract does not list overhead and profit as terms, \r\n  but instead indicates the $61,000.00 is an additional amount that represents \r\n  10% of the $610,000.00 contract price.Â  Furthermore, the construction in Sentry \r\n  was substantially completed whereas only $10,000.00 of the $610,000.00 Zepsa \r\n  project had been completed.\r\nBecause we find Sentry distinguishable, \r\n  Zepsa is limited to recovery provided for by the strict terms of the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien statute.Â  This â€œstatute provides that debts for â€˜labor performedâ€™ or â€˜materials \r\n  furnishedâ€™ are lienable debts.â€Â  Hardin Constr. Group, Inc. v. Carlisle Constr. \r\n  Co., 300 S.C. 456, 457, 388 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990); see Johnson \r\n  v. Barnhill, 279 S.C. 242, 245, 306 S.E.2d 216, 218 (1983) (â€œIn order to \r\n  establish a mechanicâ€™s lien, it is generally necessary that the labor performed \r\n  go into something which has attached to and become a part of the real estate, \r\n  adding to the value thereof.â€); Tenny v. Anderson Water, Light &amp; Power \r\n  Co., 67 S.C. 11, 17, 45 S.E. 111, 113 (1903) (â€œâ€˜The extent of the remedy \r\n  afforded by the [mechanicâ€™s lien] act is to enforce the lien upon the property \r\n  covered.â€™â€ (quoting Johnston v. Frazee, 20 S.C. 500 (1884))).Â  \r\nWith respect to overhead and profits, the extent \r\n  of a contractorâ€™s recovery has been interpreted as follows:\r\n\r\nA contractor is only allowed a privilege for claims expressly \r\n  granted by the statute and equitable considerations do not enlarge such right.Â  \r\n  Generally, overhead costs and lost profits are not within the purview of a mechanicsâ€™ \r\n  lien statute; but, where overhead costs and profits are provided for in the \r\n  contract, they become subject to collection on a mechanicâ€™s lien. \r\n\r\n56 C.J.S. Mechanicsâ€™ Liens Â§ 196 (2000).Â Â  \r\n\r\nAs testified to by Ed Zepsa, the $61,000.00 deposit \r\n  was not associated with any labor performed.Â  The master also recognized this \r\n  fact given he stated in his order â€œthere is a reasonable and equitable basis \r\n  for claiming the balance of the deposit as an integral part of the payment due \r\n  under the contract, unrelated to actual work performed.â€ Thus, we find the master \r\n  erred in finding Zepsa was entitled to the balance of this amount under a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien action.Â  Moreover, we note the mechanicâ€™s lien statement of account, which \r\n  outlines the amount that is recoverable, is not included in the Record on Appeal.Â  \r\n  Despite this omission from the record, there is a letter from Zepsaâ€™s attorney \r\n  to the Randazzosâ€™ attorney that itemizes the amount of Zepsaâ€™s claim.Â  In this \r\n  accounting, the â€œTotal due on workâ€ is valued at $10,846.00.Â  Accordingly, Zepsaâ€™s \r\n  recovery under its mechanicâ€™s lien action is limited to $10,846.00, an amount \r\n  that the parties agree represents the work completed.Â  Â Â Â \r\nOur decision is consistent with the holdings in \r\n  other jurisdictions.Â  See, e.g., In re Regâ€™l Bldg. Sys., Inc., \r\n  273 B.R. 423, 443 (Bankr. D. Md. 2001), affâ€™g 320 F.3d 482 (4th Cir. \r\n  2003) (â€œ[A] claim for lost profits arising from a breach of contract based on \r\n  wrongful termination of a contract before construction is completed cannot be \r\n  asserted as a mechanicâ€™s lien or as a claim payable from contractorâ€™s trust.â€); \r\n  Tilt-Up Concrete, Inc. v. Star City/Federal, Inc., 582 N.W.2d 604 (Neb. \r\n  1998) (concurring with other jurisdictions which deny lien for lost profits \r\n  because they compensate a party for work not yet performed); Fortune v. Million \r\n  Dev. Co., 768 P.2d 1194, 1197 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1989) (holding that â€œa lien \r\n  filed before completion of a contract is limited to the value of the labor or \r\n  services actually furnished at the time the lien is filed . . . rather than \r\n  the full contract price payable after completion of the contractâ€); Bangor \r\n  Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Robbins Plumbing Co., 116 A.2d 664 (Me. \r\n  1955) (recognizing that overhead and lost profit standing by themselves are \r\n  not lienable); see generally W. J. Dunn, Annotation, Amount For Which \r\n  Mechanicâ€™s Lien May Be Obtained Where Contract Has Been Terminated or Abandoned \r\n  by Consent of Parties or Without Fault on Contractorâ€™s Part, 51 A.L.R.2d \r\n  1009 (1957 &amp; Supp. 2003) (discussing the following methods for valuing a \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien where contract had been prematurely terminated:Â  (1) amount \r\n  of work performed up to the date work was stopped; (2) amount proportional to \r\n  entire contract price; (3) amount of profit included in lien in limited jurisdictions; \r\n  (4) amount of profit excluded; and (5) amount includes contract price less amount \r\n  of completion).\r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nThe Randazzos argue the master erred by \r\n  awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Zepsa and not to them. \r\nThe Randazzos raise this issue in conjunction \r\n  with their first issue.Â  They assert that â€œ[i]f this Court reverses the lower \r\n  courtâ€™s finding regarding the lien, the Appellants will become the prevailing \r\n  party under the statute.â€Â  The Randazzos do not make any argument that the master \r\n  erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees other than to contend that because we should \r\n  reverse on the first issue, we should also reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe determination as to the amount of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees that should be awarded under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute is addressed to \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc., \r\n  345 S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThe courtâ€™s decision \r\n  regarding such a matter will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  Id.  \r\nIn an action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees is governed by section 29-5-10(a).Â  This \r\n  section states in pertinent part, â€œThe costs which may arise in enforcing or \r\n  defending against the lien under this chapter, including a reasonable attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee, may be recovered by the prevailing party.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) \r\n  (1991).\r\nSection 29-5-10(b) outlines the procedure \r\n  for determining the â€œprevailing party.â€Â  The statute in effect at the time of \r\n  this action provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\nFor purposes of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the determination \r\n  of the prevailing party is based on one verdict in the action.Â  One verdict \r\n  assumes some entitlement to the mechanicâ€™s lien and the consideration of compulsory \r\n  counterclaims.Â  The party whose offer is closer to the verdict reached is considered \r\n  the prevailing party in the action.Â  If the difference between both offers and \r\n  the verdict is equal, neither party is considered to be the prevailing party \r\n  for purposes of determining the award of costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nIf the plaintiff makes no written offer of settlement, the \r\n  amount prayed for in his complaint is considered to be his final offer of settlement.\r\nIf the defendant makes no written offer of settlement, the \r\n  value of his counterclaim is considered to be his negative offer of settlement.Â  \r\n  If the defendant has not asserted a counterclaim, his offer of settlement is \r\n  considered to be zero.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(b) (Supp. 2002). [2]Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Zepsa made a written offer \r\n  of settlement for $40,000.00.Â  Because the Randazzos did not make an offer of \r\n  settlement, the value of their counterclaims, $88,000, is considered a negative \r\n  offer of settlement.Â  As previously discussed, the $40,000.00 deposit should \r\n  not have been included as part of the mechanicâ€™s lien and, thus, Zepsa should \r\n  have been awarded $10,864.00.Â  Even excluding the amount of the deposit, Zepsa \r\n  still remains the prevailing party and was properly awarded attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  Given the Randazzos do not challenge the amount of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  we affirm the masterâ€™s decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn view of the foregoing analysis, we \r\n  hold the master erred in awarding $50,486.00 to Zepsa for its mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\n  Because the $40,000 balance of the agreed upon deposit, which the parties characterized \r\n  as overhead expenses and lost profit, was not a term of the construction contract, \r\n  it was not a proper lienable item under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â  The master \r\n  did, however, correctly award $10,864.00 to Zepsa for the value of work that \r\n  had been completed on the project.Â  Finally, we affirm the masterâ€™s decision \r\n  to award Zepsa attorneyâ€™s fees given it was the â€œprevailing partyâ€ under the \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien statute.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Although we recognize section 29-5-10 was amended in 1999, we cite \r\n    to the most current version of this subsection given no substantive amendments \r\n    have been made to the subsection since this litigation began.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  We note section 29-5-10(b) was substantively amended in 1999 and \r\n    the new version became effective on June 11, 1999.Â  Act No. 83, 1999 S.C. \r\n    Acts 269.Â  Prior to the amendment, the portion of the statute applicable to \r\n    settlement offers and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees stated, â€œIf the defendant \r\n    makes no written offer of settlement, his offer of settlement is considered \r\n    to be zero.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(b) (1991); see Lauro v. Visnapuu, \r\n    351 S.C. 507, 570 S.E.2d 551 (Ct.

[1] Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nShortly before 1:00 a.m. on October \r\n  4, 2000, two officers of the Columbia Police Department, while on uniform patrol, \r\n  responded to a call regarding a burglary in process at 34-F Bethel Bishop Apartments \r\n  within the Columbia city limits.Â  While en route, the officers also received \r\n  a report of â€œshots firedâ€ at the apartment.\r\nUpon arriving at the scene, the officers \r\n  observed the door to apartment 34-F open, and they entered the doorway.Â  One \r\n  of the officers, Jesse Carrillo, saw â€œa black male subject in some black shorts \r\n  or something â€¦ [a]nd when he saw us, he just kind of stood in the door right \r\n  there and basically refused to come out as we were trying to call him out because \r\n  we didnâ€™t know who he was.â€Â  The man the officers observed was Abdullah.\r\nThe officers sought cooperation from \r\n  Abdullah, who instead moved near a bedroom door where he stood in a manner such \r\n  that his left side was shielded from the officersâ€™ view.Â  According to Abdullah, \r\n  he moved toward the bedroom door so that he could toss into the bedroom a gun \r\n  left by purported burglars shortly before the officers arrived.\r\nAfter unsuccessfully â€œpleadingâ€ with \r\n  Abdullah to cooperate, Officer Carrillo â€œreached in and grabbedâ€ Abdullah in \r\n  an effort â€œto pull him out of the bedroom.â€Â  A struggle ensued and, due to Abdullahâ€™s \r\n  superior size and strength, Officer Nelson joined with Officer Carrillo in the \r\n  struggle.Â  During the struggle, Abdullah announced he was the victim of the \r\n  burglary and had called 911.Â  The officers intended to handcuff Abdullah with \r\n  his hands behind him, as required by procedure, but were unable to do so.Â  They \r\n  eventually managed to handcuff one of his wrists to a chair in the kitchen.Â  \r\n  \r\nAt this point, the officers knew \r\n  neither the accuracy of Abdullahâ€™s claim to be a victim nor the security status \r\n  of the apartment.Â  They had observed bullet holes outside the apartment door \r\n  and inside the apartment.Â  As the officers sought Abdullahâ€™s cooperation, they \r\n  observed bullet holes in the walls of the apartment.Â  Once Abdullah was secured, \r\n  Officer Carrillo described the officersâ€™ perspective and concerns as follows: \r\n  \r\n\r\n  [W]e donâ€™t know if weâ€™ve got additional \r\n    victims down that are going to need medical assistance.Â  We donâ€™t know if \r\n    weâ€™ve got subjects hiding.Â  We donâ€™t know who else is in there.Â  So thatâ€™s \r\n    why weâ€™ve got to clear it essentially for persons for safety reasons â€¦ we \r\n    still didnâ€™t know if we had people in there because that was as far as I had \r\n    gotten â€¦. We didnâ€™t know even at that point if there were more suspects in \r\n    there â€¦ so we wanted to basically contain the apartment â€¦ with this alleged \r\n    burglary in progress so that way we could make sure we didnâ€™t have anymore \r\n    victims in there, anymore suspects.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Officer Carrillo conducted \r\n  a protective sweep of the apartment to search for victims, suspects, and to \r\n  preserve the crime scene.Â  He went to the doorway of the bedroom where Abdullah \r\n  had been standing.Â  Light from the kitchen partially illuminated the bedroom, \r\n  enabling Officer Carrillo to see Adbullahâ€™s previously discarded gun lying on \r\n  the bed.Â  Officer Carrillo then turned on the bedroom light, at which time he \r\n  saw money, drug paraphenalia, and bags containing green, leafy material he believed \r\n  was marijuana. \r\nOfficer Carrillo immediately contacted \r\n  his supervisor, who obtained a search warrant from a magistrate and summoned \r\n  narcotics agents.Â  The contraband was seized pursuant to a search warrant, and \r\n  the green, leafy material was later determined to be marijuana.Â  Abdullah was \r\n  charged and indicted for possession with intent to distribute marijuana and \r\n  possession with intent to distribute marijuana within one-half mile proximity \r\n  of a school.Â  \r\nAt trial, Abdullah moved to suppress \r\n  the evidence seized, contending that the search and seizure violated the Fourth \r\n  Amendment.Â  The circuit court granted the motion to suppress, concluding that \r\n  no exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless search.Â  The State \r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate \r\n  court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, \r\n  5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829&nbsp;(2001).Â  On appeal from a suppression hearing, this \r\n  court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports \r\n  the findings.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 \r\n  (2000).Â  In an appeal from a motion to suppress evidence based on Fourth Amendment \r\n  grounds, an appellate court may conduct its own review of the record to determine \r\n  whether the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  See State \r\n  v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 70, 572 S.E.2d 456, 460 (2002) (stating \r\n  â€œBrockman does not hold the appellate court may not conduct its own review \r\n  of the record to determine whether the trial judgeâ€™s decision is supported by \r\n  the evidenceâ€).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues that the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting Abdullahâ€™s motion to suppress evidence obtained during \r\n  its warrantless search of the apartment, contending the search did not violate \r\n  the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  We agree.\r\nThrough its â€œexclusionary rule,â€ \r\n  the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable \r\n  searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  Similarly, the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution provides protection against unlawful searches and seizures.Â  SeeÂ  \r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â  Evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment \r\n  is excluded in both state and federal court.Â  See Mapp v. Ohio, \r\n  367 U.S. 643 (1961);Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 643, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  837, 840 (2001).Â  \r\nâ€œGenerally, a warrantless search \r\n  is per se unreasonable and thus violative of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition \r\n  against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. \r\n  323, 331, 457 S.E.2d 616, 621 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œHowever, a warrantless search \r\n  will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search falls within one of \r\n  a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions to the Fourth \r\n  Amendment exclusionary rule.â€Â Â  Id., 317 S.C. at 331-32, 457 S.E.2d at \r\n  621.Â  In such cases, the burden is upon the State to justify a warrantless search.Â  \r\n  State v. Bailey, 276 S.C. 32, 35, 274 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1981).Â  The State \r\n  contends that the warrantless search in the present case fell within exceptions \r\n  to the Fourth Amendment provided by the â€œexigent circumstances doctrineâ€ and \r\n  the â€œplain view doctrine.â€\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Exigent Circumstances\r\nLaw enforcement officials have long \r\n  been permitted to act without the permission of a magistrate when the â€œexigencies \r\n  of the situation [have] made that course imperative.â€Â  McDonald v. U.S., \r\n  335 U.S. 451, 456 (1948).Â  The exigent circumstances doctrine provides an exception \r\n  to the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s protection against warrantless searches, but only \r\n  where, from an objective standard, a â€œcompelling need for official action and \r\n  no time to secure a warrantâ€ exist.Â  State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 587, \r\n  347 S.E.2d 882, 886 (1986) (quoting Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499 (1978)).Â  \r\n  For instance, a warrantless search is justified under the exigent circumstances \r\n  doctrine to prevent a suspect from fleeing or where there is a risk of danger \r\n  to police or others inside or outside a dwelling.Â  Minnesota v. Olson, \r\n  495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990).Â  In such circumstances, a protective sweep of the premises \r\n  may be permitted.Â  See Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 337 (1990) \r\n  (allowing a protective sweep of a house during an arrest where the officers \r\n  have â€œa reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area \r\n  to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest sceneâ€);Â  \r\n  see also Brown, 289 S.C. at 587, 347 S.E.2d at 886 (agreeing that \r\n  police may be justified in conducting a â€œprotective sweepâ€ of a crime scene \r\n  where the potential for danger exists).Â  Additionally, â€œthe Fourth Amendment \r\n  does not bar police officers from making warrantless entries and searches when \r\n  they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid.â€Â  \r\n  Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978). \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nIn the present case, the officers \r\n  were responding to a call reporting burglary and gunfire.Â  They arrived at the \r\n  scene to discover an uncooperative person, Abdullah, who only attempted to identify \r\n  himself as the alleged victim after the officers abandoned their reasonable \r\n  but futile efforts to secure his cooperation and instead turned to physically \r\n  subduing him.Â  Additionally, the officers observed bullet holes inside and outside \r\n  the walls of the premises.Â  We are firmly persuaded from our review of the record \r\n  that the totality of the circumstances, including Abdullahâ€™s unsettling behavior \r\n  and the evidence of a violent crime and gunfire, gave the officers highly reasonable \r\n  grounds from an objective standard for searching the premises with the dual \r\n  goals of securing the scene against perpetrators and facilitating assistance \r\n  to possible victims.Â  Moreover, the immediate need to secure the premises and \r\n  assist potential victims provided no time for the officers to obtain a warrant \r\n  before conducting their sweep of the crime scene.Â  Thus, we find the State met \r\n  its burden of proof in demonstrating that exigent circumstances existed to permit \r\n  the Stateâ€™s warrantless search of the premises where Abdullah and the drugs \r\n  were lawfully found.[3]\r\nAccordingly, we find no evidence \r\n  in the record to support the circuit courtâ€™s assessment that, â€œonce [the officers] \r\n  handcuffed [Abdullah] to the chair, there werenâ€™t any exigent circumstances \r\n  anymore.â€Â  We find this basis for the circuit courtâ€™s ruling improvidently presupposes \r\n  that subduing and securing Abdullah foreclosed the officersâ€™ objectively reasonable \r\n  need to search the crime scene for suspects and victims. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Plain View Doctrine [4] \r\nUnder the plain view doctrine, any \r\n  object falling within the plain view of a law enforcement officer who is lawfully \r\n  in a position to view the object is subject to lawful seizure.Â  Brown, \r\n  289 S.C. at 588, 347 S.E.2d at 885.Â  The plain view exception to the warrant \r\n  requirement requires that â€œ(1) the initial intrusion which afforded the authorities \r\n  the plain view was lawful; (2) the discovery of the evidence was inadvertent; \r\n  and (3) the incriminating [nature of the] evidence was immediately apparent \r\n  to the seizing authorities.â€Â  State v. Culbreath, 300 S.C. 232, 237, \r\n  387 S.E.2d 255, 257 (1990). [5] \r\nHere, Officer Carrilloâ€™s initial \r\n  intrusion into the room containing the evidence was lawful because he was properly \r\n  conducting a protective sweep to secure the premises.Â  His discovery of the \r\n  gun, money and drugs was clearly inadvertent, because he was searching for other \r\n  victims or suspects and securing the scene.Â  Finally, Officer Carrillo testified \r\n  that the incriminating nature of the gun, money, and bags of marijuana was immediately \r\n  apparent to him.Â  Thus, we find that the items seized during the search, and \r\n  suppressed at trial, were clearly within Officer Carrilloâ€™s plain view.Â  Moreover, \r\n  we note that Abdullahâ€™s own attorney acknowledged before the circuit court that \r\n  the officers saw the drugs in â€œplain viewâ€ after they entered the house.\r\nWe respectfully find the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s reliance on Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987) to defeat the \r\n  Stateâ€™s plain view argument is misplaced.Â  In Hicks, the officer had \r\n  to move a stereo to read its serial number and identify it before he had probable \r\n  cause to seize it.Â  In contrast, Officer Carrillo had probable cause to seize \r\n  the evidence, without ever touching or moving it, because of his lawful presence \r\n  and immediate observations that the evidence was incriminating.Â  Thus, Hicks \r\n  is clearly distinguishable from the present case.\r\nWe also respectfully reject the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s reasoning that turning on the bedroom light negated the application \r\n  of the plain view exception to the warrant requirement.Â  In Texas v. Brown, \r\n  460 U.S. 730 (1983), an officer shined a flashlight into a vehicle and saw contraband.Â  \r\n  The United States Supreme Court held that the evidence was in plain view despite \r\n  the use of artificial illumination.Â  Id. at 740.Â  The Court stated that \r\n  â€œthe use of artificial means to illuminate a darkened area simply does not constitute \r\n  a search, and thus triggers no Fourth Amendment protection.â€Â  Id.Â  Similarly, \r\n  our supreme court in State v. Culbreath found that evidence was in plain \r\n  view, and subject to warrantless search and seizure, when an officer inadvertently \r\n  discovered the evidence by shining his flashlight into a suspectâ€™s car due to \r\n  legitimate concerns about the suspectâ€™s safety.Â  See also State \r\n  v. Daniels, 252 S.C. 591, 596, 167 S.E.2d 621, 624 (1969) (finding the use \r\n  of a flashlight in a lawful search of a suspectâ€™s car is â€œof no real consequenceâ€ \r\n  when the evidence found had been left in a place where it could be â€œeasily seenâ€).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find Officer Carrilloâ€™s use of the bedroom light, particularly \r\n  under the exigent circumstances, was proper, and the evidence seized was in \r\n  plain view notwithstanding the use of artificial illumination.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nWe conclude that the circuit court \r\n  erred in suppressing the evidence.Â  Due to the manifest presence of exigent \r\n  circumstances and the application of the plain view doctrine, the search did \r\n  not violate the Fourth Amendment and the evidence was properly seized.Â  The \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]    We review this interlocutory appeal under State v. McKnight, \r\n    287 S.C. 167, 168, 337 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1985) and State v. Henry, 313 \r\n    S.C. 106, 108, 432 S.E.2d 489, 490 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Those cases provide, \r\n    in pertinent part, that â€œa pre-trial order granting the suppression of evidence \r\n    which significantly impairs the prosecution of a criminal case is directly \r\n    appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1976),â€ which permits appellate \r\n    review of â€œ[a]n order affecting a substantial right made in an action when \r\n    such order â€¦ in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from \r\n    which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] In light of the uniformity and well-settled nature of exigent circumstances \r\n    law in federal and state courts throughout the United States, we elect not \r\n    to burden the reader with unnecessary case citations.Â  For the reader desiring \r\n    additional authority, we refer generally to 68 Am.Jur.2d Searches and Seizures \r\n    Â§ 134 (Supp. 2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]    The reasonableness of the officersâ€™ conduct may be further gleaned \r\n    from the decision to secure a warrant to seize the contraband once the protective \r\n    sweep was concluded and exigent circumstances unquestionably ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â We address the applicability of the plain view doctrine although \r\n    the evidence was technically seized pursuant to a warrant.Â  It is readily \r\n    apparent that the basis for the issuance of the warrant was Officer Carrilloâ€™s \r\n    plain view observation of the contraband.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] However, the United States Supreme Court has concluded that the plain \r\n    view exception to the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s warrant requirement applies even \r\n    if the discovery of the evidence was not inadvertent, if the other requirements \r\n    of the exception are satisfied.Â  Horton v.

Hinton appeals from \r\n  a declaratory judgment that his out-of-state conviction rendered him ineligible \r\n  for parole by virtue of South Carolinaâ€™s subsequent violent offender statute.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\nSince June 17, 1992, Jack L. Hinton has been serving \r\n  a thirty-year sentence pursuant to a South Carolina kidnapping conviction.Â  \r\n  Prior to the present conviction, Appellant completed a jail sentence in Ohio \r\n  for a 1986 conviction for abduction.\r\nUpon Appellantâ€™s incarceration, the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Corrections (â€œSCDCâ€) provided a projected parole eligibility date \r\n  of February 19, 2000.Â  Based on this projected date, the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services (â€œthe Departmentâ€) conducted a pre-parole \r\n  investigation and presented Appellantâ€™s case to the Parole Board for a hearing \r\n  on March 1, 2000.Â  Appellant was denied parole shortly thereafter.\r\nBefore a second parole hearing scheduled for April \r\n  17, 2002, the Department notified Appellant that he was not eligible to be considered \r\n  for parole pursuant to South Carolinaâ€™s subsequent violent offender statute.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  For purposes of applying the subsequent violent offender provision of section \r\n    24-21-640, should the exclusive list of â€œviolent crimesâ€ in section 16-1-60 \r\n    be interpreted to implicitly include out-of-state convictions?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nThe Omnibus Crime Bill of June 3, 1986, enacted \r\n  section 16-1-60 and amended section 24-21-640 of the South Carolina Code to \r\n  prohibit the Parole Board from granting parole â€œto any prisoner serving a sentence \r\n  for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing for a \r\n  prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Â§ 16-1-60.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 2001).Â  Section 16-1-60 codifies which crimes are considered \r\n  â€œviolent crimes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 2001).Â  Effective January \r\n  1, 1994, the General Assembly amended section 16-1-60 so that each offenseâ€™s \r\n  name was parenthetically followed by its South Carolina Code section.Â  The statute \r\n  was again amended on January 12, 1995, this time adding the statuteâ€™s final \r\n  sentence:Â  â€œOnly those offenses specifically enumerated in this section are \r\n  considered violent offenses.â€Â  S.C.

Breech, 308 S.C. 356, 417 \r\n  S.E.2d 873 (1992), which involved a defendant charged with unlawfully driving \r\n  under the influence of alcohol.Â  Specifically, the issue before the court was \r\n  whether the defendantâ€™s prior out-of-state convictions were within the scope \r\n  of section 56-5-2940, which enhanced the penalty for repeat offenders.Â  The \r\n  version of section 56-5-2940 in effect when the supreme court decided Breech \r\n  expounded:\r\n\r\n  For the purposes of this chapter any conviction . . . for the violation of \r\n    any law or ordinance of this State or any municipality of this State that \r\n    prohibits any person from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence \r\n    of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or narcotics shall constitute a prior offense \r\n    for the purpose of any prosecution for any subsequent violation hereof.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2940 (1991).\r\nNoting that the rules of statutory construction \r\n  required that criminal statutes be construed strictly with ambiguities resolved \r\n  in favor of the defendant, the supreme court determined that the statute did \r\n  not cover out-of-state convictions because explicit language in the statute \r\n  limited its coverage to â€œviolation of any law or ordinance of this State \r\n  or any municipality of this State.â€Â  Breech, 308 S.C. at 358, \r\n  417 S.E.2d at 874 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2940 (1991)).Â  Effective June \r\n  30, 1992, the General Assembly subsequently amended section 56-5-2940 to provide \r\n  for enhanced penalties when the prior convictions were from another state: â€œFor \r\n  the purposes of this chapter any conviction, entry of a plea of guilty or of \r\n  nolo contendere, or forfeiture of bail for the violation of any law or ordinance \r\n  of this or any other state or any municipality of this or any other state that \r\n  prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence \r\n  of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or narcotics constitutes a prior offense for \r\n  the purpose of any prosecution for any subsequent violation hereof.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann Â§ 56-5-2940.Â  By virtue of the statutory amendment, the State is now permitted \r\n  to include out-of-state convictions in determining whether a DUI committed on \r\n  or after June 30, 1992 is a second or subsequent offense.Â  State v. Tennyson, \r\n  315 S.C. 471, 471-72, 445 S.E.2d 630, 630 (1994).\r\nWe recently addressed the same question for an entirely different statute in \r\n  State v. Zulfer, 345 S.C. 258, 547 S.E.2d 885 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. \r\n  dismissed, 353 S.C. 537, 579 S.E.2d 317 (2003).Â  Zulfer related to \r\n  section 16-11-311(A)(2), which allows a burglary offense to be enhanced to first-degree \r\n  burglary if â€œthe burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two \r\n  or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of both.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) (2003).\r\nIn concluding that the statute applied to out-of-state burglary and housebreaking \r\n  convictions, we stated that, unlike the â€œof this stateâ€ language in Breech, \r\n  the statute in Zulfer contained no language explicitly providing jurisdictional \r\n  limits.Â  We further noted that to â€œrestrict the predicate offenses for a first-degree \r\n  burglary charge to acts occurring within South Carolina would give the statute \r\n  a meaning that the legislature clearly did not intend.â€ State v. Zulfer, \r\n  345 S.C. 258, 263, 547 S.E.2d 885, 887 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nOther states have examined the use of prior convictions from another state \r\n  as the basis for the enhancement of punishment for an offense committed in the \r\n  forum state.Â  If the statute contains limiting language, the statute is determinative \r\n  of whether the prior out-of-state conviction may be utilized to enhance the \r\n  punishment.Â  The Supreme Court of New Hampshire held in New Hampshire v. \r\n  Cardin, 156 A.2d 118 (N.H. 1959) the defendant, who was charged with operating \r\n  a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquors, could not \r\n  be considered as a second offender when his first conviction was in Massachusetts.Â  \r\n  Their statute reads:Â  \r\n\r\n  Any person who shall be convicted of operating, or attempting to operate, \r\n    a motor vehicle upon any way while under the influence of intoxicating liquor \r\n    . . . shall be imprisoned . . . .Â  Upon a second conviction, he shall be imprisoned \r\n    . . . his license shall be revoked and he shall be ineligible for a license \r\n    for the next three calendar years.\r\n\r\nCardin, 156 A.2d at 315 (quoting N.H. Rev. \r\n  Stat. Ann. Â§ 262:19).Â  â€œWayâ€ is defined as â€œany public highway, street, avenue, \r\n  road, alley, park or parkway, or any private way laid out under authority of \r\n  statute.â€Â  Id.Â  The court professed:Â  â€œThe statute obviously refers to \r\n  a public way within the State of New Hampshire.Â  Whenever a conviction in another \r\n  state is to be considered in determining whether a second offense has been committed \r\n  under a local statute the Legislature has so stated in express terms.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn New Jersey v. Coleman, 484 A.2d 1250 (N.J. 1984), the Superior Court \r\n  of New Jersey, Appellate Division reviewed whether their mandatory extended \r\n  term of imprisonment for a person previously convicted of an offense involving \r\n  the use or possession of a firearm encompasses prior out-of-state convictions.Â  \r\n  The statute declares:\r\n\r\n  If the grounds specified in subsection d. are found . . . the court shall \r\n    sentence the defendant to an extended term as required by 2C:43-6c . . . . \r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n\r\n   d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second offender with a firearm.Â  \r\n    The defendant is at least 18 years of age and has been previously convicted \r\n    of any of the following crimes: 2C:11-3, 2C:11-4, 2C:12-1b., 2C:13-1, 2C:14- \r\n    2a., 2C:14-3a., 2C:15-1, 2C:18-2, 2C:29-5, 2C:39-4a., or has been previously \r\n    convicted of an offense under Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes which is \r\n    equivalent of the offenses enumerated in this subsection and he used or possessed \r\n    a firearm, as defined in 2C:39-1f., in the course of committing or attempting \r\n    to commit any of these crimes, including the immediate flight therefrom.\r\n\r\nN.J. Stat. Ann. Â§ 2C:44-3.Â  N.J. Stat. Ann. section 2C:43-6c \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  A person who has been convicted of an offense enumerated by this subsection \r\n    and who used or possessed a firearm during its commission, attempted commission \r\n    or flight therefrom and who has been previously convicted of an offense involving \r\n    the use or possession of a firearm as defined in 2C:44-3d., shall be sentenced \r\n    by the court to an extended term as authorized by 2C:43-7c., notwithstanding \r\n    that extended terms are ordinarily discretionary with the court.\r\n\r\nThe court held:\r\n\r\n  [The defendant] was not â€œpreviously convicted of an offense involving the \r\n    use or possession of a firearm as defined in 2C:44-3d.â€Â  N.J.S.A. 2C:44-3d \r\n    is precise and unambiguous in its definition of the prior crimes which mandate \r\n    imposition of an extended term.Â  Certain Title 2C offenses are specified and \r\n    any other offense â€œunder Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes which is equivalent \r\n    of the offenses enumerated in this subsection . . . .â€Â  No other offenses \r\n    are included; subsection d. does not allow equivalent offenses under the laws \r\n    of foreign jurisdictions to trigger the mandatory extended term provision.\r\n\r\nColeman, 484 A.2d at 1252.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In Missouri v. Rellihan, 662 S.W.2d \r\n  535 (Mo. Ct. App. 1983), the appellant argued the trial court erred in proclaiming \r\n  him to be a prior offender.Â  A prior offender is defined in their statute as \r\n  â€œone who has pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty of one felony.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 543 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 558.016.2).Â  The court ruled:\r\n\r\n  The foregoing section (Â§ 558.016.2), by its very wording, sets forth no requirement \r\n    that the term felony is restricted or limited to felonies committed in Missouri.Â  \r\n    To state it another way, it is clear to this court that the Missouri General \r\n    Assembly intended the term felony to define and thus include, felony offenses \r\n    from other jurisdictions--federal and sister states. . . .Â  The General Assembly, \r\n    had it intended otherwise, could have included limiting language, such as \r\n    â€œhas been found guilty of one felony in this state,â€ or words \r\n    of similar limitation.Â  No such language having been included by the General \r\n    Assembly, it is quite clear that the General Assembly intended the term felony \r\n    to be a term of inclusion which permits the trial court to impose sentencing, \r\n    instead of the jury, for a prior felony offense committed within, and subject \r\n    to, federal and sister state jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nId. at 544-45.\r\n\r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s subsequent violent offender statute establishes: \r\n  The board must not grant parole nor is parole authorized to any prisoner \r\n    serving a sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate \r\n    sentencing for a prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Section \r\n    16-1-60.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 2001).Â  Section \r\n  16-1-60, which was enacted concurrently in 1986, instructs: \r\n\r\n  For purposes of definition under South Carolina law, a violent crime includes \r\n    the offenses of . . . kidnapping (Section 16-3-910) . . . .Â  Only those offenses \r\n    specifically enumerated in this section are considered violent offenses.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 2001).\r\nContrastive to Breech where the legislature explicitly limited the statuteâ€™s \r\n  jurisdictional coverage, and dissimilar to Zulfer where the statute contained \r\n  no limits whatsoever, the statute in this case was amended in 1995 to include \r\n  its explicitly exclusionary ultimate sentence, but it is not clear whether or \r\n  not the General Assembly intended for that language to exclude convictions of \r\n  other jurisdictions.Â  In an informal opinion issued on May 24, 1995, an Assistant \r\n  Deputy Attorney General suggested that even after the January 12, 1995 amendment, \r\n  the statute encompasses crimes committed in other states or against federal \r\n  law, provided that the crime for which the offender was convicted shares the \r\n  same elements with one of the enumerated violent offenses of section 16-1-60.Â  \r\n  S.C. Op. Atty. Gen. (1995 WL 803666). \r\nAlthough we do not think it sensible to place undue emphasis on statutory nomenclature \r\n  differences, we cannot discard as without import the glaring peculiarity that \r\n  the crime of abduction appears nowhere among the enumerated offenses of section \r\n  16-1-60.Â  The State urges the adoption of a same-elements test, which it contends \r\n  resolves this problem.Â  The Department explained that in following this approach, \r\n  it looks to whether the particular actions taken by the defendant which satisfy \r\n  the elements of the crime in the other state would satisfy the elements of one \r\n  of the enumerated crimes of section 16-1-60.\r\nWe find little evidence that such a test was the \r\n  intent of our legislature for this particular statute, for if it had been, such \r\n  an intent would have been made more overt, as is the case with section 17-25-45, \r\n  which was drafted to explicitly include â€œa federal or out-of-state conviction \r\n  for an offense that would be classified as a most serious offense under this \r\n  section.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2000).\r\nMoreover, we find such an approach unduly problematic, for we are uncertain \r\n  how the Parole Board could reliably know on which particular elements of an \r\n  offense a jury based its guilty verdict.Â  Indeed, as is the case with Ohioâ€™s \r\n  codification for abduction, there are multiple avenues by which a jury can determine \r\n  that an accused committed the crime of abduction.Â  The result is that, although \r\n  some abduction convictions may fit within the elements of South Carolinaâ€™s codification \r\n  of kidnapping, some abduction convictions invariably will not.Â  \r\nConsidering the relevant statutes in tandem illustrates \r\n  this disconcerting predicament.Â  Ohio has codified abduction as follows: \r\n \r\n  (A) No person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly do any of the \r\n    following:\r\n   \r\n    (1) By force or threat, remove another from the place where the other person \r\n      is found;\r\n    (2) By force or threat, restrain the liberty of another person, under circumstances \r\n      which create a risk of physical harm to the victim, or place the other person \r\n      in fear;\r\n    (3) Hold another in a condition of involuntary servitude.\r\n  \r\n  (B) Whoever violates this section is guilty of abduction, a felony of the \r\n    third degree.\r\n\r\nOhio Rev. Code Ann. Â§ 2905.02 (West 2003).Â  South \r\n  Carolina has codified kidnapping as the following:\r\n\r\n  Whoever shall unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct \r\n    or carry away any other person by any means whatsoever without authority of \r\n    law, except when a minor is seized or taken by his parent, is guilty of a \r\n    felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for a period not to exceed \r\n    thirty years unless sentenced for murder as provided in Section 16-3-20.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (2003).\r\nBased on one set of facts and circumstances, an \r\n  accused in Ohio may be prosecuted for abduction under several theoriesâ€”(1) the \r\n  accused â€œremove[d] another from the place where the other person is found,â€ \r\n  (2) the accused â€œrestrain[ed] the liberty of another personâ€ and still another \r\n  being that he â€œ[b]y force or threat, restrain[ed] the liberty of another person, \r\n  under circumstances which create a risk of physical harm to the victim, or place[d] \r\n  the other person in fear,â€ and (3) the accused â€œh[e]ld another in a condition \r\n  of involuntary servitude.â€Â  South Carolinaâ€™s kidnapping statute requires proof \r\n  of an unlawful act taking one of several alternative forms: seizure, confinement, \r\n  inveiglement, decoy, kidnapping, abduction, or carrying away.Â  State v.

Jefferies, \r\n  316 S.C. 13, 19, 446 S.E.2d 427, 430-31 (1994).\r\nGiven that no explication accompanies a juryâ€™s finding \r\n  of guilt, we are unclear how the Parole Board can differentiate which theory \r\n  the jury ultimately embraced--or alternatively stated, which elements the jury \r\n  found satisfied--in returning a guilty verdict.Â  Appellantâ€™s Ohio indictment \r\n  for kidnapping alleged that he\r\n\r\n  without privilege to do so, knowingly and by force or threat, restrained \r\n    Anne Miller of her liberty, under circumstances which created a risk of physical \r\n    harm to the said Anne Miller or which place[d] the Anne Miller in fear, in \r\n    violation of section 2905.02 of the Ohio revised code and against the peace \r\n    and dignity of the state of Ohio.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing this indictment, we cannot say with any \r\n  degree of certitude whether the juryâ€™s guilty verdict was within the scope of \r\n  our kidnapping statute.Â  We find it unacceptable that the Parole Board should \r\n  look to the so-called â€œfactsâ€ of the case to make this determination, \r\n  for the â€œfactsâ€ are almost always disputed, and neither this court nor \r\n  the Parole Board has any way of extricating which particular â€œfactsâ€ the jury \r\n  decided were true and which were not.Â  The Parole Board should not undertake \r\n  such a determination in what would amount to a de facto second trial and an \r\n  egregious due process violation. \r\nDisavowing the same-elements test, the 1995 amendment to section 16-1-60, makes \r\n  plain that the General Assembly intended to prevent broadening of the statuteâ€™s \r\n  coverage.Â  We are unable to discern the intent of the General Assembly in regard \r\n  to the addition of the final sentence.Â  If we determine that the sentence was \r\n  meant only to prevent the expansion of â€œviolent crimesâ€ to other South Carolina \r\n  offenses not specifically enumerated in section 16-1-60, then we effectively \r\n  give the language no meaning because the principle of inclusio unius est \r\n  exclusio alterius (the inclusion of one is the exclusion of another) \r\n  already prohibits inclusion of non-enumerated offenses.Â  See Brown \r\n  v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 349, 540 S.E.2d 846, 850 (2001) (â€œThus, the maxim \r\n  of expressio unius est exclusio alterius . . . applies to exclude day \r\n  care centers from falling within the statute since day care centers are not \r\n  expressly included.â€).Â  Such an interpretation violates the rule that we should \r\n  seek a construction that gives effect to every word of a statute rather than \r\n  adopting an interpretation that renders a portion meaningless.Â  See McClenaghan \r\n  v. McClenaghan, 20 S.C. Eq. (1 Strob. Eq.) 295 (1847) (observing â€œif the \r\n  clause means any thing, and we are obliged to find some meaning for it, on the \r\n  maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereatâ€). \r\nIn enacting the 1995 amendment, the General Assembly intended to circumscribe \r\n  application of the statute.Â  Because we cannot judicially fashion a demarcation \r\n  line, we are bound to construe the statute with exactitude.Â  First, when the \r\n  nature of restrictive language is irresolvedly ambiguous, prudence dictates \r\n  that we adopt the interpretation least likely to run afoul of the legislatureâ€™s \r\n  restrictive intent.Â  In this case, that interpretation is one of strict construction.Â  \r\n  Second, in applying such an interpretation, our practice remains in accord with \r\n  the requirement that penal statutes be construed strictly against the State.Â  \r\n  Third, by adopting such an interpretation of section 16-1-60, we avoid the needless \r\n  entanglement of a same-elements test.\r\nFinally, we note that our decision does not mean that Appellant will ever succeed \r\n  in being paroled.Â  Instead, our ruling merely assures that the authority to \r\n  grant or deny parole remains with the body that can most capably make such challenging, \r\n  case-by-case determinations:Â  the Parole Board.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (concurring in result): I concur \r\n  in the result reached by the majority, that an Ohio conviction for the crime \r\n  of abduction does not qualify as a second or subsequent conviction under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. ' 24-21-640 (Supp. 2002), a statute that prohibits the Board of South \r\n  Carolina Probation, Parole and Pardon Services from granting a parole to a â€œprisoner \r\n  serving a second or subsequent conviction . . . for violent crimes as defined \r\n  in Section 16-1-60.â€Â  I simply differ with the majority in how we should arrive \r\n  at that conclusion.\r\nThe respondent Jack L. Hinton, a prisoner serving a sentence for kidnapping \r\n  since his conviction in 1992 in Greenville County, South Carolina, once served \r\n  a sentence of from three to ten years following his conviction in 1986 in Hamilton \r\n  County, Ohio, for the offense of abduction, an offense proscribed by Ohio Rev. \r\n  Code Ann. ' 2905.02 (2002). \r\nSection 24-21-640 provides in part as follows:\r\n\r\n  The board must not grant parole nor is parole authorized to any prisoner \r\n    serving a sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate \r\n    sentencing for a prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Section \r\n    16-1-60.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his conviction in South Carolina \r\n  in 1992, S.C. Code Ann. ' 16-1-60 (1991), [1]  provided in relevant part:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  For purposes of definition under South Carolina law, a violent crime includes \r\n    the offenses of . . . kidnapping . . . . \r\n\r\nA related statute, S.C. Code Ann. ' 16-1-70 (1991), defined a â€œnonviolent crimeâ€ \r\n  as including â€œall offenses not specifically enumerated in Section 16-1-60.â€\r\n\r\nSubsequent amendments to Section 16-1-60, \r\n  [2]  among other things,Â  added code sections to identify the offenses defined \r\n  as violent crimes and a second sentence which reads, â€œOnly those offenses specifically \r\n  enumerated in this section are considered violent offenses.â€\r\nBecause Section 16-1-60 is a penal statute, its \r\n  terms must be strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant. \r\n  [3] Â  We, as judges, can add nothing to the words of the statute either \r\n  by inference or intendment but must construe those words literally. \r\n  [4] \r\nAt no point in its history has Section 16-1-60 \r\n  defined the offense of abduction in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ' 2905.02 \r\n  (2002) as a violent crime.Â  That offense throughout has not been one â€œspecifically \r\n  enumerated in Section 16-1-60.â€Â  According a strict construction to Section \r\n  16-1-60 and a liberal construction to Section 16-1-70, we can only conclude \r\n  that the term â€œviolent crime,â€ as used in Section 16-1-60 does not include the \r\n  offense of abduction in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ' 2905.02 (2002).\r\nThis court's decision in State v. Zulfer, [5]  a case that dealt with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) \r\n  (Supp. 2000), does not aid the State.

Trundy, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: CEL Products, LLC (â€œCELâ€) filed \r\n  a complaint against Margaret Rozelle (â€œRozelleâ€) alleging numerous actions.Â  \r\n  Rozelle counterclaimed. Rozelle appeals the trial judgeâ€™s order granting summary \r\n  judgment on Rozelleâ€™s counterclaims.Â  We affirm.\r\n\r\n  FACTS\r\n  CEL purchased a business from William and Joanna White (â€œthe \r\n    Whitesâ€). After taking over the business, CEL kept Rozelle, who had worked \r\n    for the Whites, as an at-will employee. CEL later became dissatisfied with \r\n    Rozelle and fired her. CEL eventually brought suit against the Whites, claiming \r\n    fraud in the sale of the business. The circuit court ordered the Whitesâ€™ accounts \r\n    receivable to be held in escrow. According to CEL, Rozelle then induced several \r\n    customers owing those accounts receivable to make payments into a non-escrow \r\n    account. \r\n\r\nOn October 27, 2000, CEL filed a complaint against Rozelle alleging civil contempt, \r\ntortious interference with contract, conspiracy, and unfair trade practices. In \r\nFebruary 2001, Rozelle answered and counterclaimed, claiming abuse of process, \r\nlibel and slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. She also \r\nalleged that CELâ€™s suit was frivolous under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 to -50 \r\n(Supp. 2000), the Frivolous Proceedings Sanctions Act. Rozelle served interrogatories, \r\nrequests for admission, and requests for production on CEL, at the same time as \r\nher answer. CEL failed to respond, and Rozelle moved to compel in June 2001. The \r\ntrial court granted Rozelleâ€™s motion to compel on December 6, 2001. Around that \r\ntime, CEL moved for a voluntary dismissal of its action against Rozelle and for \r\nsummary judgment on Rozelleâ€™s counterclaims. CEL submitted responses to Rozelleâ€™s \r\ninterrogatories and requests for production on December 17, 2001. \r\nIn March and April 2002, Rozelle attempted to depose Charles Lee, but the parties \r\n  failed to reach an agreement on scheduling so the deposition did not take place. \r\n  Rozelle filed a new motion to compel the deposition on April 14. In July of \r\n  2003, the trial judge held a hearing to entertain the various motions. The judge \r\n  first granted CELâ€™s motion for voluntary dismissal of CELâ€™s actions. Then, the \r\n  judge granted CELâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to Rozelleâ€™s counterclaims. \r\n  The trial judge did not rule on Rozelleâ€™s motion to compel.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp;\r\n     \r\n      Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment since \r\n        Rozelle claims not to have had a full and fair opportunity to conduct \r\n        discovery?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (2)&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in hearing the motion to dismiss before \r\n      hearing the motion to compel discovery?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  However, summary judgment \r\n  is improper if the parties dispute the inferences to be drawn from the facts \r\n  even if the facts themselves are not in dispute. Tupper v. Dorchester County, \r\n  326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  â€œIn determining whether any \r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Osborne \r\n  ex rel. Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nRozelle argues the trial judge erred in granting CELâ€™s \r\n  motion for summary judgment on her counterclaims because she had not been afforded \r\n  a â€œfull and fair opportunityâ€ to complete discovery.Â  Rozelle further argues \r\n  the trial judge should have conducted a hearing on her motion to compel a deposition \r\n  before granting the motion for summary judgment. We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe plain language of Rule 56(c), SCRCP, mandates \r\n  the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery against a party \r\n  who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element \r\n  essential to the partyâ€™s case and on which that party will bear the burden of \r\n  proof at trial.â€ Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. S.C. Dept. of Labor, \r\n  Licensing, and Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 485, 523 S.E.2d 795, 800 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).\r\nThe hearing on CELâ€™s motion for summary judgment \r\n  occurred seventeen months after Rozelle filed her answer and counterclaims. [1] Â  Rozelle did not attempt to schedule a deposition \r\n  until thirteen months after filing her counterclaims. More importantly, Rozelle \r\n  did not present an affidavit in response to CELâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  As a result, the trial judge had only Rozelleâ€™s pleadings and CELâ€™s affidavits \r\n  before him. Therefore, he did not err in granting the motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  See Humana Hosp.-Bayside v. Lightle, 305 S.C. 214, 216, 407 S.E.2d \r\n  637, 638 (1991) (â€œWhere a plaintiff relies solely upon the pleadings, files \r\n  no counter-affidavits, and makes no factual showing in opposition to a motion \r\n  for summary judgment, the lower court is required, under Rule 56, to grant summary \r\n  judgment, if, under the facts presented by the defendant, he was entitled to \r\n  judgment as a matter of law.â€). \r\nNor was it error for the trial judge to grant CELâ€™s motion for summary judgment \r\n  before conducting a hearing on Rozelleâ€™s motion to compel discovery.Â  The manner \r\n  in which a trial is conducted is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., Baber v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. 31, 41, 488 S.E.2d \r\n  314, 319 (1997) (holding that the conduct of a trial is largely within the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s sound discretion, the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion or the commission of a legal error that results \r\n  in prejudice for appellant).Â  Had the trial judge granted CELâ€™s summary judgment \r\n  motion prior to considering the prejudice to Rozell caused by the inability \r\n  to depose Lee, the trial judge would have failed to exercise discretion.Â  A \r\n  failure to exercise discretion amounts to an abuse of that discretion.Â  Samples \r\n  v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105,112, 495 S.E.2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  When \r\n  a trial judge is vested with discretion but his ruling reveals no discretion \r\n  was in fact exercised, an error of law has occurred.Â  Ballon Plantation, \r\n  Inc. v. Head Balloons, Inc., 303 S.C. 152,155, 399 S.E.2d 439, 441 (1990).Â  \r\n\r\nIn the instant case it is clear from the record that the trial court exercised \r\n  discretion.Â  The following colloquy took place:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    THE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â Â  Where is the affidavit that is submitted in response to \r\n      his motion for summary judgment?\r\n    MS. TRAVAGLIO:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We have not submitted any affidavits in response \r\n      to his motion.\r\n    THE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â Â  How do I make a determination then that there is an issue \r\n      of fact in this case?Â  Based on what?Â  What do I have?â€¦\r\n    THE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â Â  My question is when you file a lawsuit, surely you arenâ€™t \r\n      filing a lawsuit thinking, I think I have a cause of action.\r\n    THE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â Â  You have a cause of action and itâ€™s based on something \r\n      that you have.\r\n    MS. TRAVAGLIO:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, Your Honor.\r\n    THE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â Â  Now, you strengthen that through discovery, but you donâ€™t \r\n      create your cause of action by taking depositions.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nRozelleâ€™s response to CELâ€™s summary judgment motion and \r\n  affidavits was a request for a continuance to depose Lee, but Rozelle failed \r\n  to demonstrate that further discovery would be beneficial.Â  See Dawkins \r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003) (stating â€œnon moving \r\n  party to summary judgment motion must demonstrate the likelihood that further \r\n  discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is not \r\n  merely engaged in a fishing expeditionâ€).\r\nThis court is cognizant of the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision \r\n  in Lanham v. Blue Cross, 349 S.C. 356, 563 S.E.2d. 331 (2002).Â  In Lanham, \r\n  the court found that the trial court erred in ruling on the summary judgment \r\n  motion without first ruling on Lanhamâ€™s motion to produce and motion to compel. \r\n  However, the instant case is distinguishable from Lanham.Â  In Lanham, \r\n  the information sought in discovery was necessary to respond to a material claim \r\n  by Blue Cross and the information was in the sole possession of \r\n  Blue Cross.Â  That is not the case here.Â  Rozelleâ€™s counterclaims were centered \r\n  on alleged statements made by, and to, CELâ€™s owner, Lee.Â  CEL had disclosed \r\n  what those statements were, who made them and to whom they were made.Â  Rozelle \r\n  failed to offer anything that contradicted this.Â  Deposing Lee would have yielded \r\n  very little, if any, additional relevant evidence.Â  As the instant case was \r\n  approximately twenty-one months old when CEL filed its motion for summary judgment, \r\n  Rozelleâ€™s ability to sustain her counterclaims should not have hinged upon speculative \r\n  deposition evidence.Â  As such, summary judgment was warranted to avoid prolonging \r\n  litigation based upon a mere possibility that Rozelle might obtain some helpful \r\n  information from a deposition.\r\nâ€œThe gist and gravamen of the discovery rules mandate full \r\n  and fair disclosure to prevent a trial from becoming a guessing game or one \r\n  of ambush for either party.â€Â  Scott v. Greenville Hous. Auth., 353 S.C. \r\n  639, 652, 579 S.E.2d 151, 158 (Ct. App. 2003). â€œThe rights of discovery provided \r\n  by the Rules give the trial lawyer the means to be prepared for trial. Where \r\n  these rights are not accorded, prejudice must be presumed and, unless the party \r\n  who has failed to submit to discovery can show a lack of prejudice, reversal \r\n  is required.â€ Downy v. Dixon 294 S.C. 42, 46, 362 S.E.2d 317, 319 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1987).Â  Here, CEL showed and the record indicates that Rozelle suffered \r\n  no prejudice.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased upon the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  While we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling, the \r\n    procedural history of this case raises a concern. The record makes very clear \r\n    that CEL did not cooperate with Rozelleâ€™s discovery requests.Â  Rozelle served \r\n    interrogatories, requests to admit, and requests for production upon CEL in \r\n    February 2001, but CEL did not respond.Â  Rozelle then filed a motion to compel \r\n    in June 2001.Â  CEL did not complete this discovery until December 2001, when \r\n    the trial judge issued an order compelling it to respond.Â  In failing to respond \r\n    to Rozelleâ€™s discovery for approximately ten months â€“ including six months \r\n    after Rozelle filed the motion to compel â€“ CEL significantly delayed the resolution \r\n    of this case.Â  We do not condone such dilatory tactics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3724","title":"State v.

affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\nAt approximately 8:00 a.m. on December \r\n  11, 1997, the victimâ€™s body was discovered in a vacant lot in Florence, South \r\n  Carolina.Â  DNA testing revealed there was semen on the victimâ€™s pants and in \r\n  her vagina.Â  Dr. Edward Proctor, the forensic pathologist who performed the \r\n  autopsy, concluded the victim died as a result of â€œmassive blunt force injury \r\n  to the head,â€ likely caused by multiple blows from a heavy object, such as a \r\n  board.Â  \r\nSteven \r\n  [1]  Blathers, an acquaintance of the victim, lived across the street from \r\n  the vacant lot where the body was found.Â  After DNA testing, it was determined \r\n  that the semen found on the victim belonged to Blathers.Â  Blathers admitted \r\n  to having sex with the victim in exchange for providing her with crack cocaine.Â  \r\n  However, Blathers was not viewed as a suspect because his mother attested he \r\n  was home at the approximate time the victim was attacked.Â  Additionally, Jessie \r\n  Jones, a neighbor of Blathers who lived in front of the vacant lot, saw the \r\n  victim fighting with a man that night and testified Blathers did not match the \r\n  description of that individual.Â  The following colloquy occurred during direct \r\n  examination of Jones:\r\n\r\n  Q.Â  How tall is Mr. Steve Blathers?\r\n  A.Â  About five foot if he that.Â  \r\n    He was short.\r\n  Q.Â  You didnâ€™t see Steve Blathers \r\n    out there by that school bus at the fight, didnâ€™t you?\r\n  A.Â  Not that I can say for sure, \r\n    no.\r\n  Q.Â  Well, that fellow you described \r\n    is six feet light-skinned wasnâ€™t Steve Blathers?\r\n  A.Â  No.\r\n  Q.Â  And you didnâ€™t see Steve Blathers \r\n    around there, didnâ€™t you?\r\n  A.Â  No, I didnâ€™t.Â  Because I couldnâ€™t \r\n    recognize none of them.\r\n\r\nJones stated \r\n  that, around 2:00 a.m. the morning of the murder, he observed a group of people \r\n  hitting a sign with a stick outside of his house.Â  Thereafter, Jones noticed \r\n  a â€œtall manâ€ and a â€œlady [who] was kind of shortâ€ arguing and â€œhitting each \r\n  other with sticks.â€Â  Another neighbor, Patrice Washington, said that, at approximately \r\n  2:10 a.m., she witnessed a â€œshadow run pas[t] [her] window,â€ followed by â€œtwo \r\n  more shadows.â€Â  Washington declared â€œ[t]he first shadow was screaming.â€Â  Sometime \r\n  after 2:00 a.m., Blathers looked out the door of his house and saw a six-foot \r\n  tall â€œshadow run across the streetâ€ with â€œsomething in [his] hand.â€\r\nMonique Ellerbee Cooks \r\n  [2]  called Crime Stoppers the night the victimâ€™s body was discovered.Â  \r\n  Cooks informed Crime Stoppers that she was with the victim at a club on the \r\n  night of the murder.Â  Cooks claimed the victim left the club with a man and \r\n  that Cooks did not see the victim again.Â  Cooks gave a detailed description \r\n  of the man.Â  When police visited Cooks, she reiterated that she had been with \r\n  the victim the night she was killed but did not tell the police that she had \r\n  witnessed the murder.Â  Cooks failed to point out anyone in three photographic \r\n  lineups, one of which included Pagan.\r\nCooks later assisted police in drawing \r\n  a composite sketch of the man she saw with the victim the night of the murder.Â  \r\n  Police interviewed Pagan after an individual identified him from the composite \r\n  sketch.Â  Police then re-interviewed Cooks, who identified Pagan in a photographic \r\n  lineup as the person she saw with the victim the night of the murder.Â  Cooks \r\n  indicated that she had recognized Pagan the first time she viewed the lineup \r\n  but that â€œshe was scared to point him outâ€ at that time.\r\nApproximately one month later, Cooks \r\n  professed that she witnessed the murder.Â  On the night the victim was killed, \r\n  Cooks followed the victim, who was walking with a man that Cooks had never seen \r\n  before.Â  Cooks heard the victim arguing with the man about money and drugs.Â  \r\n  Speaking in an angry tone, the man asked the victim for the twenty dollars she \r\n  owed him.Â  While standing in the area where Jessie Jones stated he had seen \r\n  people hitting a sign, Cooks watched the man and victim â€œhitting each other \r\n  with sticks.â€Â  The man told the victim, â€œBitch, you gone give me my money.â€Â Â Â  \r\n  When the victim ran, the man chased the victim and beat her in the face and \r\n  head with a board.Â  Cooks screamed.Â  The man told Cooks that he was going to \r\n  â€œget [her] next.â€Â  Cooks identified Pagan as the victimâ€™s attacker.\r\nPolice issued an arrest warrant for \r\n  Pagan on January 15, 1998.Â  Pagan fled to New Jersey but was apprehended on \r\n  February 20, 1998.\r\nIn February 1999, more than one year \r\n  after the murder, Pagan was arrested while out on bond.Â  The arrest was based \r\n  upon a statement given by Tamika Lambert.Â  Lambert stated she was the passenger \r\n  in a vehicle being driven by someone named â€œDerrickâ€ when a police car with \r\n  its blue light on attempted to pull them over.Â  According to Lambert, â€œDerrickâ€ \r\n  drove off at a high speed, crashed the car, and ran away.Â  When Lambert saw \r\n  â€œDerrickâ€ several hours later, â€œDerrickâ€ apologized to her and explained why \r\n  he ran from the police.Â  Lambert declared:\r\n\r\n  He start[ed] out telling me that \r\n    he couldnâ€™t stop because he didnâ€™t have no [driverâ€™s] license.Â  Then he told \r\n    me that he was onâ€”Iâ€™m trying to see which one he told me first.Â  He was on \r\n    a $100,000 bond because they hadâ€”[t]his girlâ€”[t]hey accused him of killing \r\n    some girl.Â  And it was all because of some girl named Monica.\r\n\r\nLambert identified Pagan as the man \r\n  who (1) told her his name was â€œDerrickâ€; (2) ran from the police; (3) wrecked \r\n  the car; and (4) later explained to her why he had run from the police.Â  The \r\n  car that Pagan wrecked after the chase was registered to Paganâ€™s wife.Â  Pagan \r\n  denied both knowing Lambert and wrecking his wifeâ€™s car.\r\nBefore Lambert testified at trial, \r\n  defense counsel objected to her testimony, claiming the evidence was unduly \r\n  prejudicial and too remote in time to be considered in conjunction with the \r\n  murder charge.Â  The trial court overruled the objection, finding Lambertâ€™s testimony \r\n  was admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE, as Monique Ellerbee Cooks said sheâ€™d \r\n  been threatened and Lambertâ€™s testimony referred to Paganâ€™s comment that a girl \r\n  named â€œMonicaâ€ was the cause of his problems.Â  Defense counsel unsuccessfully \r\n  renewed this objection after Lambert testified.Â  In charging the jury, the trial \r\n  judge instructed that Lambertâ€™s testimony was admissible only as to identification.\r\nThe jury found Pagan guilty of murder.Â  \r\n  He was sentenced to life imprisonment.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nPagan contends the trial judge erred \r\n  in admitting Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony.Â  Specifically, Pagan claims Lambertâ€™s \r\n  testimony that Pagan ran from police while out on bond for this murder charge \r\n  was only slightly relevant, yet highly prejudicial.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Evidence of Flight \r\nâ€œFlight from prosecution is admissible \r\n  as evidence of guilt.â€Â  State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 413, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  32, 36-37 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. \r\n  196, 200, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (stating flight is â€œat least some evidenceâ€ \r\n  of defendantâ€™s guilt); State v. Freely, 105 S.C. 243, 89 S.E. 643 (1916) \r\n  (declaring the flight of one charged with crime has always been held to be some \r\n  evidence tending to prove guilt).Â  Evidence of flight has been held to constitute \r\n  evidence of defendantâ€™s guilty knowledge and intent.Â  See State v. \r\n  Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); Town of Hartsville v. Munger, \r\n  93 S.C. 527, 77 S.E. 219 (1913); State v. Brownlee, 318 S.C. 34, 455 \r\n  S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 1995); see also State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. \r\n  1, 292 S.E.2d 581 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (finding evidence of flight admissible to \r\n  show guilty knowledge, intent, and that defendant sought to avoid apprehension); \r\n  State v. Grant, 275 S.C. 404, 407, 272 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (â€œ[A]ttempts \r\n  to run away have always been regarded as some evidence of guilty knowledge and \r\n  intent.â€) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Davis, 354 S.C. \r\n  348, 580 S.E.2d 778 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that circumstances of defendantâ€™s \r\n  flight from police after they attempted traffic stop allowed reasonable inference \r\n  of guilty conduct).Â  Flight, when unexplained, is admissible as indicating consciousness \r\n  of guilt, for it is not to be supposed that one who is innocent and conscious \r\n  of that fact would flee.Â  See State v. Williams, 350 S.C. 172, \r\n  564 S.E.2d 688 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 532 \r\n  (1994)).\r\nThe critical factor to the admissibility \r\n  of evidence of flight is whether the totality of the evidence creates an inference \r\n  that the defendant had knowledge that he was being sought by the authorities.Â  \r\n  Beckham, 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d at 612.Â  It is sufficient that circumstances \r\n  justify an inference that the accusedâ€™s actions were motivated as a result of \r\n  his belief that police officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking \r\n  him for that purpose.Â  Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Jones, 319 \r\n  A.2d 142 (Pa. 1974)).Â  Flight or evasion of arrest is a circumstance to go to \r\n  the jury.Â  See Beckham, 334 S.C. at 315, 513 S.E.2d at 612; State \r\n  v. Turnage, 107 S.C. 478, 93 S.E. 182 (1917); see also State v. \r\n  Byers, 277 S.C. 176, 284 S.E.2d 360 (1981) (recognizing that evidence of \r\n  flight is proper and that it is oftentimes appropriate for counsel to argue \r\n  to the jury the inferences growing out of flight); Grant, 275 S.C. at \r\n  408, 272 S.E.2d at 171 (stating that while a jury charge on flight as evidence \r\n  of guilt is improper, admission of evidence and argument by counsel concerning \r\n  it are allowed).\r\nTamika Lambertâ€™s testimony was clearly \r\n  admissible for the purposes of proving Paganâ€™s flight and â€œguilty knowledge.â€Â  \r\n  After failing to stop for a blue light, evading police, and leaving the scene \r\n  of the accident, Pagan told Lambert he was out on bond â€œbecause they . . . accused \r\n  him of killing some girl,â€ and that he was in trouble because of a girl named \r\n  â€œMonica.â€Â  As such, Lambertâ€™s testimony was admissible for proving: (1) Pagan \r\n  was attempting to avoid capture and violate his bond provisions for the murder \r\n  charged in the instant case and (2) Pagan could identify the very person, Monique \r\n  Ellerbee Cooks, who was the key witness in the case.Â  A jury could have easily \r\n  inferred knowledge of Paganâ€™s guilt from these actions.\r\nIn State v. Beckham, the defendant \r\n  left for a vacation in Florida several hours before a warrant was issued for \r\n  his arrest.Â  After spending one hour in a Florida hotel, defendant then drove \r\n  all night to Kentucky.Â  Our Supreme Court held this was admissible as flight \r\n  evidence and was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Beckham, 334 S.C. at \r\n  315, 513 S.E.2d at 612-13.Â  Similarly, in State v. Al-Amin, the defendant \r\n  fled the scene after dumping the victimâ€™s body in a dumpster next to his apartment.Â  \r\n  This Court found evidence of the defendantâ€™s flight was circumstantial evidence \r\n  to be submitted to the jury.Â  Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 413, 578 S.E.2d at \r\n  36-37.Â  \r\nPagan cites McFadden v. State, \r\n  342 S.C. 637, 539 S.E.2d 391 (2000), in his brief for the proposition that Tamika \r\n  Lambertâ€™s testimony was not admissible as evidence of flight because the police \r\n  were â€œnot at that point pursuing [Pagan] as a suspect in the earlier murder.â€Â  \r\n  However, McFadden is clearly inapposite as it concerns the rule that, \r\n  in a trial in absentia, the jury cannot consider the defendantâ€™s \r\n  absence at trial as evidence of defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  McFadden, 342 S.C. \r\n  at 644-45, 539 S.E.2d at 395.\r\nConcomitantly, we find Tamika Lambertâ€™s \r\n  testimony was properly admitted as flight or â€œguilty knowledgeâ€ evidence.\r\nII.Â  Corroboration \r\n  Evidence \r\nAll relevant evidence is admissible.Â  \r\n  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001); State v. Aleksey, \r\n  343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 \r\n  S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003); Rule 402, SCRE.Â  â€œRelevant evidenceâ€ is defined \r\n  as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of \r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable \r\n  than it would be without the evidence.Â  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, \r\n  577 S.E.2d 438 (2003); State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 \r\n  (2001); State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 2001); \r\n  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Under Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing \r\n  upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.Â  \r\n  In re Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003); Adams, 354 \r\n  S.C. at 378, 580 S.E.2d at 794; State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d \r\n  640 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nAs the only eyewitness able to identify \r\n  Pagan as the victimâ€™s killer, Monique Ellerbee Cooksâ€™s credibility was of utmost \r\n  importance.Â  Cooks was not entirely forthcoming in her first few meetings with \r\n  investigators, which might have adversely affected the veracity of her testimony.Â  \r\n  We find Lambertâ€™s testimony about Paganâ€™s comments after he fled from police \r\n  was relevant in corroborating Cooksâ€™s testimony.Â  Lambert declared that Pagan \r\n  told her he was out on bond â€œbecause they . . . accused him of killing some \r\n  girl,â€ and he blamed this trouble on someone named â€œMonica.â€Â  This corroborates \r\n  Cooksâ€™s testimony in two respects: (1) that she was an eyewitness to the crime \r\n  and (2) that Pagan knew her identity.Â  Similarly, Lambertâ€™s testimony corroborates \r\n  Cooksâ€™s statement that she was afraid of Pagan, and that he said he would â€œget \r\n  [her] next.â€\r\nConsequently, Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony \r\n  was properly admitted as corroboration evidence, as it supported Cooksâ€™s testimony.\r\nIII.Â  \r\n  Identity Under Rule 404(b)\r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes \r\n  evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s \r\n  guilt for the crime charged.Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 \r\n  S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 679 (2000) (finding that evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is \r\n  inadmissible to prove bad character of defendant or that he acted in conformity \r\n  therewith).Â  Such evidence is admissible, however, when it tends to establish \r\n  (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common \r\n  scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to \r\n  each other that proof of one tends to establish the proof of the other; or (5) \r\n  the identity of the person charged with the present crime.Â  See State \r\n  v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923); Rule 404(b), SCRE; see also \r\n  Anderson v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 581 S.E.2d 834 (2003) (explaining that \r\n  Rule 404, the modern expression of the Lyle rule, excludes evidence of \r\n  other crimes, wrongs, or acts offered to prove character of person in order \r\n  to show action in conformity therewith; the rule creates an exception when testimony \r\n  is offered to show motive, identity, existence of common scheme or plan, absence \r\n  of mistake or accident, or intent).Â  If there is any evidence to support the \r\n  admission of bad act evidence, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).\r\nThe bad act must logically relate \r\n  to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.Â  Beck, 342 S.C. \r\n  at 135, 536 S.E.2d at 682-83; State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  578 (1999) (declaring that record must support logical relevance between prior \r\n  bad act and crime for which defendant is accused).Â Â Â  The trial judge must exclude \r\n  the evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \r\n  of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, \r\n  541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); Beck, 342 S.C. at 135-36, 536 S.E.2d at 683; Rule \r\n  403, SCRE.\r\nWe rule Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony \r\n  was admissible as tending to establish Paganâ€™s identity.Â  After Pagan fled the \r\n  scene for failing to stop for the blue light, he told Lambert that he was accused \r\n  of killing a woman, and that â€œMonicaâ€ was to blame for his trouble.Â  Lambertâ€™s \r\n  eyewitness testimony was relevant in putting Paganâ€™s flight into context.Â  The \r\n  testimony proved Pagan was attempting to flee from police because he was charged \r\n  with murdering the victim in the present case, and that he blamed the Stateâ€™s \r\n  key witness, Monique Ellerbee Cooks, for his situation.Â  This testimony was \r\n  logically relevant as evidence of Paganâ€™s identity because it connected the \r\n  murder with Paganâ€™s flight from the police one year later.\r\nWe conclude Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony \r\n  was properly admitted as evidence of Paganâ€™s identity under Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\nIV.Â  Harmless \r\n  Error \r\nAssuming arguendo the trial \r\n  judge erred in admitting Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony, we find such error was \r\n  harmless.\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends \r\n  on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. \r\n  53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  870 (1998); State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003).Â  â€œNo definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality \r\n  and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship \r\n  to the entire case.â€Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  150, 151 (1985).\r\nError is harmless where it could \r\n  not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, \r\n  355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897; Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial \r\n  errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 \r\n  S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial \r\n  is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such \r\n  that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 \r\n  S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at \r\n  795; see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) \r\n  (noting that when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that \r\n  no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside \r\n  conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result).Â  The admission of \r\n  improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other \r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003); State \r\n  v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); State v. Blackburn, \r\n  271 S.C. 324, 247 S.E.2d 334 (1978); State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, \r\n  523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Williams, 321 \r\n  S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996) (instructing that error in admission of evidence \r\n  is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence which was properly admitted); \r\n  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (explicating \r\n  that any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence \r\n  is harmless).\r\nAt trial, the State presented evidence \r\n  of two incidents in Paganâ€™s past that demonstrated his attempts to avoid arrest \r\n  or prosecution.Â  First, while under investigation for the murder in the case \r\n  sub judice, Pagan fled to his motherâ€™s home in New Jersey and \r\n  refused to return to South Carolina.Â  On January 21, 1998, six days after an \r\n  arrest warrant was issued, Pagan phoned Lt. Carlos Raines and told Raines that \r\n  he would turn himself in.Â  When this did not occur, United States Marshals located \r\n  Pagan in New Jersey approximately one month later, arrested him, and arranged \r\n  for transport to South Carolina.\r\nSecond, in 1995, Pagan was charged \r\n  with failure to stop for a blue lightâ€”the same type of offense that formed the \r\n  basis of Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony.Â  Pagan stated: â€œIn 1995, I caught a parole \r\n  violation due to a failure to stop for a blue light. . . . I came [to South \r\n  Carolina] in â€˜95 to see my kids; thatâ€™s when I caught the failure to stop for \r\n  a blue light.Â  And I went back home [to New Jersey] and thatâ€™s when they violated \r\n  my parole.â€Â  In addition to this prior flight and parole violation evidence, \r\n  the State introduced Paganâ€™s criminal record, which included two convictions \r\n  for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.Â  Extensive testimony was presented \r\n  regarding Paganâ€™s various stays in prison.Â  Pagan admitted violating certain \r\n  rules and regulations of the Department of Corrections by getting married while \r\n  incarcerated at Palmer Pre-Release Center and possessing a cell phone.\r\nMoreover, the State presented a witness, \r\n  Lavenia Helton, who testified regarding an argument between the victim and Pagan \r\n  that occurred prior to the murder of the victim.Â  In early December of 1997, \r\n  the victim and Pagan were at Heltonâ€™s apartment.Â  The victim attempted to leave \r\n  the apartment with a bag of crack cocaine.Â  Pagan told the victim, â€œBitch, give \r\n  me my shit.â€Â  The victim handed the bag containing the crack cocaine to Pagan, \r\n  who had a gun in his hand.Â  Pagan then told the victim, â€œBitch you gone die.â€\r\nBecause \r\n  there was testimony regarding other episodes of flight, prior convictions, a \r\n  parole violation, violations of Department of Corrections rules and regulations, \r\n  and a previous incident of violence between Pagan and the victim, Lambertâ€™s \r\n  testimony did not have a substantial effect upon Paganâ€™s trial.Â  We hold Tamika \r\n  Lambertâ€™s testimony was cumulative to the evidence presented by the State at \r\n  trial.Â  Any error in admitting this testimony was harmless.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nThe trial judge did not err in admitting \r\n  Tamika Lambertâ€™s testimony that Pagan ran from police while out on bond for \r\n  the murder charge.Â  Lambertâ€™s testimony was admissible as (1) flight and â€œguilty \r\n  knowledgeâ€ evidence; (2) corroboration of Moniqueâ€™s testimony; and (3) evidence \r\n  of Paganâ€™s identity under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  Furthermore, any error in admitting \r\n  Lambertâ€™s testimony was harmless as it was cumulative to the evidence presented \r\n  at trial.Â  Accordingly, Paganâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In the record and Respondentâ€™s brief, â€œStevenâ€ is spelled with a \r\n    â€œv.â€Â  In the Appellantâ€™s brief, his name is written as â€œStephen.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The record refers to â€œMonique Ellerbee Cooks.â€Â  In the Appellantâ€™s \r\n    brief, her name is written as â€œMonique Cooks.â€Â  The Respondentâ€™s brief states \r\n    her name as â€œMonique Ellerby.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3725","title":"In the Interest of: Christopher H.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3725","description":"In this criminal case, Christopher H pled guilty to grand larceny and first-degree burglary without representation by counsel.

Hodge, Jr., \r\n          of Darlington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Christopher \r\n  H. pled guilty to grand larceny and first-degree burglary and was committed \r\n  to the Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period not to exceed \r\n  his twenty-first birthday.Â  He was not represented by counsel at any of his \r\n  juvenile hearings.Â  Christopher argues on appeal that: (1) he did not validly \r\n  waive his right to counsel pursuant to Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. \r\n  806 (1975); and, (2) his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently \r\n  entered.Â Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.Â  \r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nChristopher H. was charged in Darlington \r\n  County with the following five offenses that occurred between March and September \r\n  of 2001:Â  (1) grand larceny of a Yamaha four-wheeler, (2) assault and battery, \r\n  (3) first-degree burglary, (4) grand larceny of a Honda four-wheeler, and (5) \r\n  second-degree burglary.Â  At his 48-hour detention hearing, the assistant solicitor \r\n  told the judge that the clerkâ€™s office had screened Christopher and his legal \r\n  guardian and determined they did not qualify for a public defender.Â  Although \r\n  Christopher did not have counsel, the public defender sat in on the detention \r\n  hearing.Â  The judge ordered detention until a hearing the following Tuesday.Â  \r\n  At the conclusion of the detention hearing, the solicitor noted that he had \r\n  advised Christopherâ€™s legal guardian that she needed to retain counsel for him. \r\n  The judge responded:Â  â€œYes.Â  You would need â€“ If you donâ€™t qualify for the Public \r\n  Defender, you do need to go ahead and retain private counsel.Â  These offenses \r\n  are of a very serious nature, so, you know, he needs some representation in \r\n  this case.â€Â  \r\nChristopherâ€™s ten-day detention hearing \r\n  was held at the same time as five other juvenilesâ€™ detention hearings.Â  Several \r\n  of the juveniles were represented by the public defender.Â  When Christopherâ€™s \r\n  turn came, the public defender stated:Â  â€œYour Honor, on the [Christopher H.] \r\n  child, I remember that I stood with him last week but he did not qualify.Â  His \r\n  parents made too much money.Â  Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re not representing him.â€Â  The judge \r\n  responded â€œOkay,â€ and asked if Christopher had anything to tell him.Â  Christopher \r\n  stated in response, â€œI donâ€™t have nothing really to say.Â  I did all the crimes \r\n  and I committed them and I did them and thatâ€™s my fault.â€Â  When the judge asked \r\n  what he was charged with, the solicitor initially listed all five charges.Â  \r\n  Later, however, the solicitor stated that Christopher was charged with only \r\n  two offenses, second-degree burglary and grand larceny of a Yamaha four-wheeler.Â  \r\n  The solicitor further noted:\r\n\r\n   He is not represented.Â  The parents \r\n    do not qualify for the Public Defender.Â  I told them, approached them and \r\n    talked with them and told them that if he was guilty, it would be in his interest \r\n    to go ahead and plead today and the recommendation would be that heâ€™d be committed \r\n    to Midlands for an evaluation . . . .Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe judge questioned Christopher \r\n  directly:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Now youâ€™ve heard the Solicitor \r\n      and you heard what he said.Â  Do you feel like youâ€™re threatened or coerced \r\n      in any way by anyone?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        No, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Did you do the things youâ€™re \r\n      accused of?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Do you understand that weâ€™d \r\n      give you a trial if youâ€™d like it and put up witnesses and that kind of \r\n      thing?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Understanding that, do you still \r\n      wish to plead delinquent?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Are you delinquent?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER: \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT:\r\n    Did you break in the church?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT: \r\n    Did you steal the four-wheeler?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n

you away for a while?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    THE COURT: \r\n    Understanding that, do you still \r\n      wish to plead delinquent?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    CHRISTOPHER:\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Yes, sir.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThereafter, the family court judge \r\n  ordered that Christopher be committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice \r\n  for evaluation for a period not to exceed forty-five days. \r\n  [1]  \r\nAt Christopherâ€™s dispositional hearing, \r\n  the State presented its report recommending commitment.Â  Christopher was not \r\n  represented by an attorney and the judge was advised that he had never had an \r\n  attorney.Â  After hearing briefly from the solicitor and from Christopherâ€™s legal \r\n  guardian, the judge committed him for an indeterminate period of time not to \r\n  exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  Christopher appeals.Â Â Â  \r\n  Â \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Did Christopher validly \r\n    waive his right to counsel?\r\n\r\nThe right to counsel is guaranteed \r\n  by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and extends to juvenile \r\n  proceedings.Â  See e.g. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970).Â  \r\n  â€œA defendant may surrender his right to counsel through (1) waiver by affirmative, \r\n  verbal request; (2) waiver by conduct; and (3) forfeiture.â€Â  State v. Thompson, \r\n  355 S.C. 255, 262, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nChristopher argues that he did not \r\n  waive his right to counsel because the family court judge did not comply with \r\n  the procedures set forth in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).Â Â  \r\n  A valid waiver of counsel, either by affirmative, verbal request or by conduct, \r\n  requires compliance with Faretta.Â  See Thompson, 355 S.C. \r\n  atÂ  263, 584 S.E.2d at 135 (â€œâ€˜[T]o the extent that the defendant's actions are \r\n  examined under the doctrine of 'waiver,' there can be no valid waiver of the \r\n  Sixth Amendment right to counsel unless the defendant also receives Faretta warnings.â€™Â  Any subsequent misconduct will be treated \r\n  as a â€˜waiver by conduct.â€™â€)(citations omitted).\r\nFaretta allows an accused \r\n  to waive his right to counsel if he is (1) advised of his right to counsel, \r\n  and (2) adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation.Â  Prince \r\n  v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 424, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1990).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[i]n \r\n  the absence of a specific inquiry by the trial judge addressing the disadvantages \r\n  of a pro se defense as required by the second Faretta prong, [the \r\n  appellate court] will look to the record to determine whether petitioner had \r\n  sufficient background or was apprised of his rights by some other source.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  (citation omitted). To determine if an accused has sufficient background \r\n  to comprehend the dangers of self-representation, courts consider a variety \r\n  of factors including: \r\n (1)&nbsp; the accusedâ€™s age, educational \r\n  background, and physical and mental health; \r\n  (2)&nbsp; whether the accused \r\n  was previously involved in criminal trials; \r\n  (3)&nbsp; whether the accused \r\n  knew the nature of the charge(s) and of the possible penalties; \r\n  (4)&nbsp; whether the accused \r\n  was represented by counsel before trial and whether that attorney explained \r\n  to him the dangers of self-representation; \r\n  ( 5)&nbsp; whether the accused \r\n  was attempting to delay or manipulate the proceedings; \r\n  (6)&nbsp; whether the court \r\n  appointed stand-by counsel;\r\n  (7)&nbsp; whether the accused \r\n  knew he would be required to comply with the rules of procedure at trial; \r\n  (8)&nbsp; whether the accused \r\n  knew of the legal challenges he could raise in defense to the charge(s) against \r\n  him; \r\n  (9)&nbsp; whether the exchange \r\n  between the accused and the court consisted merely of pro forma answers \r\n  to pro forma questions; and \r\n  (10) whether the accusedâ€™s \r\n  waiver resulted from either coercion or mistreatment.\r\nGardner v. State, 351 S.C. \r\n  407, 412-13, 570 S.E.2d 184, 186-87 (2002).Â  \r\nThe record in this case reveals that \r\n  that neither the judge at the adjudicatory hearing nor the judge at the dispositional \r\n  hearing complied with the procedures in Faretta.Â  Initially, Christopher \r\n  was never adequately advised of his right to an attorney.Â  At Christopherâ€™s \r\n  48-hour detention hearing, the judge urged Christopherâ€™s legal guardian to find \r\n  representation because of the serious nature of the charges.Â  At Christopherâ€™s \r\n  adjudicatory hearing, the judge merely asked him if he understood that the court \r\n  would â€œgive [him] a trial if [heâ€™d] like it and put up witnesses and that kind \r\n  of thing.â€Â  Although the solicitor stated he had spoken with Christopherâ€™s legal \r\n  guardian about acquiring representation, that by itself does not meet the requirements \r\n  of Faretta.Â  See Watts v. State, 347 S.C. 399, 403, 556 \r\n  S.E.2d 368, 371 (2001) (finding the plea judge ineffectively warned of the dangers \r\n  of appearing pro se when, among other things, he â€œpermitted the solicitor \r\n  to relate the circumstances of Petitionerâ€™s release of his appointed attorneyâ€) \r\n  (emphasis in original). Additionally, the record does not indicate Christopher \r\n  ever elected to proceed pro se.Â  See State v. Reed, 332 \r\n  S.C. 35, 41, 503 S.E.2d 747, 750 (â€œThe right to proceed pro se must be \r\n  clearly asserted by the defendant prior to trial.â€).\r\nMoreover, both family court judges \r\n  failed to comply with Faretta because Christopher was never adequately \r\n  warned of the dangers of self-representation.Â  In addition, the record reflects \r\n  that Christopher has an insufficient background to comprehend the dangers of \r\n  self-representation based on an application of the Gardner factors: (1) \r\n  Christopher was sixteen years old at the time of the proceedings, but his psychosocial \r\n  report states that he â€œappears emotionally and physically younger than his stated \r\n  age.â€Â  Christopher has a full scale IQ of seventy-four (borderline range) and \r\n  his last year in school was the tenth grade.Â  (2) It appears from the record \r\n  that Christopher had been to family court before, but it is unclear as to the \r\n  nature of his family court experience.Â  (3) Nothing in the record indicates \r\n  that Christopher had any knowledge of the nature of the charges or the possible \r\n  penalties.Â  Instead, Christopher merely indicated his willingness to accept \r\n  responsibility for certain acts he had committed.Â  (4) Christopher never appeared \r\n  represented by counsel.Â  While the public defender sat through Christopherâ€™s \r\n  initial detention hearing, it is unclear whether he had any active involvement \r\n  or communication with Christopher. (5) There is nothing in the record to indicate \r\n  Christopher was attempting to delay or manipulate the proceedings.Â  (6) The \r\n  court did not appoint stand-by counsel.Â  (7) The record does not indicate Christopher \r\n  had any knowledge that he needed to comply with any rules of procedure or (8) \r\n  any of the legal challenges he could raise in his defense.Â  (9) The exchange \r\n  between Christopher and the family court judges amounted to little more than \r\n  pro forma questions and answers.Â  (10) Notwithstanding, the record does \r\n  not suggest that Christopherâ€™s appearance without counsel was a result of coercion \r\n  or mistreatment.Â Â  See Gardner, 351 S.C. at 412-13, 570 S.E.2d \r\n  at 186-87.\r\nWe find the record in this case does \r\n  not show that Christopher knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests Christopher forfeited his right \r\n  to counsel.Â  See Thompson, 355 S.C. at 267, 584 S.E.2d at 137 \r\n  (stating that forfeiture requires extremely dilatory conduct and situations \r\n  involving forfeiture are unusual, typically involving a manipulative or disruptive \r\n  defendant).Â  \r\nThe typical remedy for failing to \r\n  show a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel is to remand to the trial court \r\n  for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the waiver was, in fact, knowingly \r\n  and intelligently made.Â  State v. Dixon, 269 S.C. 107, 236 S.E.2d 419 \r\n  (1977).Â  However, this court can grant an appellant a new trial without an evidentiary \r\n  hearing if it is clear that a hearing on remand would serve no useful purpose.Â  \r\n  State v. Cash, 304 S.C. 223, 225, 403 S.E.2d 632, 634 (1991).Â Â  Because \r\n  we find the record clearly reflects that the family court failed to adequately \r\n  advise Christopher of the right to counsel, failed to make a specific inquiry \r\n  as to Christopherâ€™s knowledge of the dangers of self-representation, and demonstrated \r\n  that Christopher has an insufficient background to comprehend the dangers of \r\n  self-representation, we find that remanding this case for a factual determination \r\n  as to whether the waiver was knowingly and intelligently made would serve no \r\n  useful purpose.Â Â  Instead, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n  2. Did Christopher knowingly, \r\n    voluntarily, and intelligently enter a plea of guilty? \r\n\r\nBecause we reverse and remand for a \r\nnew trial on the right to counsel issue, we need not reach the issue concerning \r\nthe voluntariness of his guilty plea.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing \r\nof Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling \r\nthat an appellate court need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior \r\nissues are dispositive).\r\nAccordingly, we reverse and remand \r\n  for a new trial.Â  \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 \r\n    Â While this appeal was pending, Christopher petitioned this court for supersedeas, \r\n    habeas corpus, or other relief, arguing he was not advised of the right to \r\n    counsel and risks of proceeding pro se.Â  This court denied the request \r\n    for habeas corpus and remanded the petition for supersedeas to the family \r\n    court.Â  Because this court remanded the petition for supersedeas only, the \r\n    issue concerning Christopherâ€™s right to counsel remained before us.Â  On remand, \r\n    however, the family court granted Christopherâ€™s motion for supersedeas.Â  While \r\n    both the adjudicatory and dispositional orders originally stated that Christopher \r\n    pleaded guilty to all five charges, the orders were amended following the \r\n    remand to reflect Christopherâ€™s plea to only two of the five charges.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3726","title":"Bowman v Bowman","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3726","description":"In this divorce action, Husband appeals family court's denial of his Rule 60(b)(2) motion to set aside its judgment against him.

The family court denied the motion.Â  On appeal Husband challenges \r\n  the adequacy of the attorney fee and suit money award and the denial of his \r\n  Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) motion.Â  We affirm.\r\n \r\n  FACTS\r\n  In July 1997, after \r\n    thirty-five years of marriage, Husband filed an action for divorce seeking \r\n    equitable division of the marital estate, attorney fees, and suit monies.Â  \r\n    Wife admitted to adultery in her pleadings, and the paramount issue remaining \r\n    was the equitable division of the marital estate.Â  Each party challenged the \r\n    inclusion in the marital estate of his and her respective retirement plans, [1]  and Wife contested Husbandâ€™s claim for attorney fees and suit \r\n    monies.Â Â Â   \r\n\r\nThe family court issued an order \r\n  granting Husband a divorce, excluding Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan from the marital \r\n  estate, including Husbandâ€™s retirement plan in the marital estate, and awarding \r\n  Husband $7,048 in attorney fees and suit monies.Â  The court further requested \r\n  that the parties attempt to reach an agreement concerning the division of marital \r\n  property to accomplish the equitable division of 60% to Husband and 40% to Wife.Â  \r\n  The parties were unable to resolve all issues, necessitating the family courtâ€™s \r\n  involvement in concluding the matter.Â   \r\nBoth parties filed Rule 59(e) motions, \r\n  which were denied.Â  Thereafter, upon receipt of information through post-judgment \r\n  discovery concerning the funding source of Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan, Husband \r\n  sought relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2) and (3).Â  The family \r\n  court denied the motion, primarily finding Husband could have discovered the \r\n  information prior to trial.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, \r\n  this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, \r\n  204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, \r\n  require this court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson \r\n  v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  The decision \r\n  to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial court.Â  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15, \r\n  17 (1992).Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in granting or denying such a motion.Â  Saro Invs. v. \r\n  Ocean Holiday Pâ€™ship, 314 S.C. 116, 124, 441 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Exclusion of Wifeâ€™s Defined Benefit \r\nPlan from the Marital Estate and the Denial of Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) \r\nMotion \r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  in not granting a new trial as he sought a second opportunity to persuade the \r\n  court to include Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan in the marital estate.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Husband asserts the family court erred in denying his Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) \r\n  motion after Husband provided evidence that Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan was \r\n  funded, at least in part, from life insurance policies purchased by Wifeâ€™s employer \r\n  during the marriage. As noted, marital litigation commenced in July 1997.Â  Wifeâ€™s \r\n  defined benefit plan was created on July 1, 1998 and was funded in June 1999.Â  \r\n  It is stipulated that Wifeâ€™s defined plan â€œwas substantially funded at its inception.â€Â  \r\n  The family court reasoned that since Wife did not own the defined benefit plan \r\n  until after marital litigation was filed, the retirement plan should be excluded \r\n  from the marital estate.Â  Husband appeals from the denial of his Rule 60(b)(2) \r\n  and (3) motion. [2] \r\nThe new evidence submitted post-judgment \r\n  in support of Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) motion consists of a statement \r\n  from Wifeâ€™s employer, the South Carolina Student Loan Corporation, showing that \r\n  the assets of the defined benefit plan include the cash surrender values of \r\n  eight life insurance policies with New York Life Insurance Company.Â  Additional \r\n  evidence reveals that one of the policies was purchased in 1988, and Wife was \r\n  listed as the named insured.Â  While we agree with Husband that this information \r\n  establishes a nexus between Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan and the cash surrender \r\n  values of the life insurance policies as a funding source for the plan, \r\n  [3]  we find Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) motion was nevertheless properly \r\n  denied.Â  We consider it unnecessary to explore the differing standards between \r\n  Rule 60 (b)(2) and (3) as advanced by Husband, for we conclude that South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  strong policy towards finality of judgments trumps a partyâ€™s ability to set \r\n  aside a judgment where, as here, the party could have discovered the evidence \r\n  prior to trial.Â  SeeÂ  Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, 168, 66 S.E.2d \r\n  609, 610 (1951) (finding that equitable relief from a judgment is not available \r\n  for intrinsic fraud â€œon the theory that an issue which has been tried and passed \r\n  upon in the original action should not be retried in an action of equitable \r\n  relief, and that otherwise litigation would be interminableâ€);Â  Chewning \r\n  v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 86, 579 S.E.2d 605, 613 (2003) (finding \r\n  that while post-judgment relief was granted as a result of â€œunique facts,â€ the \r\n  court reaffirmed South Carolinaâ€™s â€œlongstanding policy towards final judgmentsâ€).Â  \r\n  \r\nHusband invites this court to apply \r\n  the â€œmisconductâ€ standard in Rule 60(b)(3).Â  Were we to do so, we would still \r\n  be constrained to affirm the family court.Â  The cases cited by Husband permit \r\n  Rule 60(b)(3) relief only where â€œthe misconduct prevented the moving party from \r\n  fully presenting its case.â€Â  Schultz v. Butcher, 24 Fed.3d 626, 630 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1994) citing Square Constr. Co. v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., \r\n  657 Fed.2d 68, 71 (4th Cir. 1981); Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 Fed.2d \r\n  910, 924 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating â€œthe challenged behavior must substantially \r\n  have interfered with the aggrieved partyâ€™s ability fully and fairly to prepare \r\n  for and proceed at trialâ€) (emphasis in original); see also Rycroft \r\n  v. Tanguay, 279 S.C. 76, 79, 302 S.E.2d 327, 329 (1983) (stating â€œequity \r\n  will not grant relief to one against whom an unfavorable judgment has been rendered, \r\n  even in consequence of fraud, where the aggrieved party has not acted with diligenceâ€); \r\n  Dunn v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 890 F.Supp. 1262, 1269 (M.D.La. 1995) \r\n  (stating â€œ[a] Rule 60(b)(3) assertion . . . must be such as to prevent the losing \r\n  party from fully and fairly presenting its case or defenseâ€).\r\nHere, Husband was aware of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  defined benefit plan, as well as her management position with the South Carolina \r\n  Student Loan Corporation.Â  Wife acknowledged this post-filing retirement account \r\n  at her May 11, 2000 deposition, approximately seven months prior to trial.Â  \r\n  Also prior to trial, Husband noticed the deposition of James Kenneth Player, \r\n  the executive vice president of Wifeâ€™s employer, for the purpose of gaining \r\n  additional evidence and information concerning the defined benefit plan.Â  However, \r\n  Husband elected not to take Playerâ€™s deposition, opting instead to enter into \r\n  the following stipulation with Wife:\r\n\r\n  As to [Wifeâ€™s] plan, we will stipulate \r\n    that the defined benefits were not created until after the date of filing.Â  \r\n    The plan was funded by the South Carolina Student Loan Corporation.Â  The plan \r\n    was substantially funded at its inception.Â  The plan utilized past â€œtime of \r\n    serviceâ€ to calculate the initial contribution to the plan.Â  We stipulate \r\n    that this is what [Wifeâ€™s employer] and/or [Wife] would otherwise testify \r\n    to if called as a witness.\r\n\r\nHusband was thus aware prior to \r\n  trial of this asset and Wifeâ€™s reluctance to disclose it.Â  Significantly, \r\n  Husband faced no legal impediment prior to trial precluding his access to information \r\n  concerning any aspect of Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan, including the planâ€™s funding \r\n  source.Â  Against this procedural history, Husband elected not to pursue further \r\n  discovery, and he entered into the above stipulation.Â  Absent valid grounds \r\n  for Rule 60(b) relief, an unfavorable ruling at trial does not provide an unsuccessful \r\n  litigant another opportunity to litigate an issue.Â  We find no abuse of discretion \r\n  and therefore affirm the family courtâ€™s denial of Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b)(2) and \r\n  (3) motion. \r\nWe in no manner condone Wifeâ€™s noncompliance \r\n  with the rules regarding discovery supplementation, and we are not unsympathetic \r\n  with litigants, like Husband, who encounter adversaries who display a deliberate \r\n  indifference to the discovery rules. [4] Â  We further recognize the myriad \r\n  difficulties and vagaries inherent in the family court arena for judges and \r\n  practitioners alike.\r\nIn this case, Husband is ultimately \r\n  not prejudiced by the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, for we are persuaded that \r\n  the family court correctly excluded Wifeâ€™s defined benefit plan from the marital \r\n  estate.Â  The post-judgment discovery does little to advance Husbandâ€™s argument, \r\n  as it simply bolsters the prior stipulation that the â€œplan was substantially \r\n  funded at its inception.â€Â  The life insurance policies at issue are best described \r\n  as corporate assets, which Wife neither controlled nor had the right to control \r\n  based on the record before us.\r\nWe believe it useful to the family \r\n  court bench and bar to provide a general framework within which to address and \r\n  properly classify employment related benefits, such as a retirement plan, purportedly \r\n  created after the date of filing of marital litigation but prior to dissolution \r\n  of the marriage.Â  We do so in recognition of the reality that some spouses in \r\n  anticipation of, and during, marital litigation have a lamentable tendency to \r\n  engage in a variety of deceptive acts and practices to secrete assets. [5] \r\nFor property to be included within \r\n  the term â€œmarital property,â€ two factors must exist:Â  property must be (1) â€œacquired \r\n  . . . during the marriageâ€ and (2) â€œowned as of the date of filing or commencement \r\n  of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2002).Â  The â€œacquired \r\n  during marriageâ€ component is generally established by showing that the property \r\n  relates to compensation earned or effort expended during the marriage.Â  See \r\n  Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996) (stating â€œ[u]pon dissolution of the marriage, property acquired during \r\n  the marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly reflects \r\n  each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition, regardless of which spouse holds \r\n  legal title.â€);Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 297, 372 S.E.2d 107, \r\n  111 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding only the appreciation in value of assets â€œresulting \r\n  directly or indirectly from the efforts of the parties was marital propertyâ€).Â  \r\n  The â€œownershipâ€ prong, while ostensibly straightforward, can raise troublesome \r\n  issues.Â  A technical application of the â€œownershipâ€ prong may in some cases \r\n  invite fraud, resulting in the improper exclusion of property from the marital \r\n  estate, which, we believe, would be contrary to legislative intent.Â  For example, \r\n  a party may sufficiently possess an ascertainable interest in or entitlement \r\n  to property â€œacquired during the marriage,â€ yet purposefully delay ownership \r\n  until after marital litigation has commenced.Â  In such an example, the partyâ€™s \r\n  interest in and entitlement to ownership is sufficient to conclude the â€œownershipâ€ \r\n  prong has been satisfied. [6] Â  To conclude otherwise would promote fraud, reward misconduct, \r\n  and contravene legislative intent.\r\nRegarding retirement plans and employment \r\n  benefits created after the commencement of marital litigation but before dissolution, \r\n  the mere fact that some aspect of the plan or benefit may relate to service \r\n  during the partiesâ€™ marriage does not mandate inclusion in the marital estate.Â  \r\n  Indeed, virtually all retirement plans and employment benefits are connected \r\n  in some manner to an employeeâ€™s prior service.Â  Further, an employer may, completely \r\n  independent of the employee, institute a retirement plan or benefit after commencement \r\n  of marital litigation.Â  Depending on the totality of the facts and circumstances, \r\n  the employee-spouse may not have an interest in or entitlement to such plan \r\n  or benefit at the time of marital litigation, i.e., a bona fide \r\n  absence of ownership when marital litigation is commenced.\r\nThe mere fact that technical ownership \r\n  of a retirement plan or employment benefit is delayed until after the commencement \r\n  of marital litigation does not mandate its exclusion from the marital estate.Â Â  \r\n  Where a party possesses an ascertainable interest in or entitlement to property \r\n  during the marriage, the partyâ€™s attempts to delay technical ownership status \r\n  until after marital litigation has commenced shall not prevent a finding of \r\n  the requisite â€œownershipâ€ necessary for inclusion in the marital estate.Â  Therefore, \r\n  where lack of ownership status as of the date of marital litigation is attributable \r\n  to any purposeful act or omission by the spouse, the property shall be deemed \r\n  â€œownedâ€ within the meaning of Â§ 20-7-473 so as to include the marital portion \r\n  in the marital estate.Â Â Â  \r\nResolution of this marital property \r\n  classification dilemma is certainly fact-intensive, and no bright line test \r\n  will suffice.Â  We continue to recognize and respect the broad discretion accorded \r\n  to family court judges in the fact-sensitive inquiries surrounding the identification \r\n  of marital and nonmarital property as well as the determination of the equitable \r\n  distribution of the marital estate.Â  See Murphy v. Murphy, 319 \r\n  S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995) (stating â€œ[f]amily court judges have \r\n  wide discretion in determining how marital property is to be distributedâ€) (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\nII. Inclusion of Husbandâ€™s Retirement \r\nPlan in the Marital Estate \r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  in including his retirement plan in the marital estate, valuing the plan as \r\n  of the filing date of marital litigation, and apportioning 40% of the planâ€™s \r\n  monthly payments to Wife. \r\nIn May 1996, approximately one year \r\n  before the filing of marital litigation, Husbandâ€™s employer, South Carolina \r\n  Electric and Gas (SCE&amp;G), informed Husband that his position would be â€œeliminated \r\n  as of June 30, 1996.â€Â  SCE&amp;G extended Husband three â€œseverance options.â€Â  \r\n  On May 30, 1996, Husband elected the third option, referred to as â€œsix monthsâ€™ \r\n  severance and early retirement.â€Â  The six monthsâ€™ â€œseverance payâ€ amounted to \r\n  $46,332 and was paid to Husband on or about July 1, 1996.Â  Monthly payments \r\n  to Husband pursuant to the early retirement option also began in July 1996, \r\n  one year prior to the commencement of marital litigation. The family court included \r\n  Husbandâ€™s early retirement benefit in the marital estate.Â  Husband, referring \r\n  to this asset exclusively as â€œseverance pay,â€ assigns error to its consideration \r\n  as marital property and inclusion in the marital estate.Â Â Â  \r\nWe initially clarify the true nature \r\n  of this asset.Â  The â€œseverance optionâ€ exercised by Husband in May 1996 consisted \r\n  of two components:Â  (1) severance pay of $46,332; and (2) a â€œSpecial Incentive \r\n  Retirement Benefitâ€ paid in monthly installments over a multi-year period.Â  \r\n  We find these benefits were â€œacquired during the marriageâ€ in the sense that \r\n  the payments were compensation for services performed during the course of the \r\n  marriage.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2002);Â  Tinsley v. \r\n  Tinsley, 326 S.C. 374, 381, 483 S.E.2d 198, 202 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The valuation \r\n  of these benefits by Raymond McKay, Husbandâ€™s expert, omits the actual severance \r\n  pay portion and includes only those retirement benefits due on or after the \r\n  date of filing of marital litigation.Â  McKay properly utilized a â€œvaluation \r\n  dateâ€ of July 9, 1997. [7]  Â He valued the retirement benefits at $326,148 at the time \r\n  of filing and $254,637 at the time of trial.Â  While Husband asserts error in \r\n  the inclusion of these benefits in the marital estate, the parties accept McKayâ€™s \r\n  methodology and valuation.Â  \r\nWe reject Husbandâ€™s continuing efforts \r\n  to characterize his retirement benefits as â€œseverance.â€Â  Not only does McKayâ€™s \r\n  valuation of these benefits exclude the severance benefits paid one year \r\n  prior to marital litigation, we adhere to South Carolinaâ€™s sound and established \r\n  approach of scrutinizing the true nature and purpose of the benefit.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., Mears v. Mears, 305 S.C. 150, 156, 406 S.E.2d 376, 380 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1991), overruled on other grounds by Marsh v. Marsh, 313 \r\n  S.C. 42, 437 S.E.2d 34 (1993) (concluding proper classification of employment \r\n  termination benefits as marital or nonmarital property â€œdepends on the purpose \r\n  of the paymentsâ€);Â  Mallet, 323 S.C. at 152, 473 S.E.2d at 810 (holding \r\n  property classified as nonmarital because the â€œpurposeâ€ of the benefit was to \r\n  replace earnings after the date commencement of marital litigation);Â  Fisher \r\n  v. Fisher, 319 S.C. 500, 504, 462 S.E.2d 303, 305 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding \r\n  benefits paid pursuant to a â€œvoluntary separation incentiveâ€ were analogous \r\n  to an â€œearly retirement,â€ and the payments were thus deemed marital property \r\n  â€œunder the facts of this caseâ€); Tinsley, 326 S.C. at 381-82, 483 S.E.2d \r\n  at 202 (holding disability benefits were not marital property since the â€œpayments \r\n  are a replacement for income he would be earning currently and would be able \r\n  to earn in the future had he not become disabledâ€).Â  Thus, classification of \r\n  property as marital or nonmarital must be determined in light of the true nature \r\n  and purpose of the benefit.Â  South Carolina does not classify property as marital \r\n  or nonmarital based on the title or nomenclature assigned by a party.Â Â Â  \r\nWe find the family court correctly \r\n  classified Husbandâ€™s retirement benefits as marital property subject to equitable \r\n  distribution.Â  The benefits are compensation for services performed during marital \r\n  years and were, thus, acquired during the marriage and owned by Husband as of \r\n  the commencement of marital litigation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 \r\n  (Supp. 2002).Â Â Â  \r\nHusband next contends the family \r\n  court erred in valuing his retirement plan as of the date marital litigation \r\n  was filed.Â  A decrease in value occurred post-filing, solely attributable to \r\n  Husbandâ€™s expenditure of these funds after the filing date.Â  Husband suggests \r\n  a valuation as of the date of trial would be more appropriate.Â  We disagree \r\n  with Husbandâ€™s position for two reasons.Â  First, Husbandâ€™s proposed property \r\n  division relies on the July 1997 valuation date, with the plan value furnished \r\n  by Husbandâ€™s expert.Â  Second, Husbandâ€™s expenditure of these funds was voluntary.Â  \r\n  Unlike the situation in Tinsley where disability payments by necessity \r\n  replaced future earnings, Husband acknowledged at trial his continuing ability \r\n  to work:Â  \r\n\r\n   \r\n    Wifeâ€™s counsel:\r\n      \r\n    Do you have any impediments \r\n      or disabilities at this time?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Husband:Â  Â Â Â \r\n      \r\n    No, sir.\r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Wifeâ€™s counsel:\r\n      \r\n    Youâ€™re in good health?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Husband:Â  Â \r\n      \r\n    Are you talking about impediments \r\n      that would stop me from going to work?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Wifeâ€™s counsel:\r\n      \r\n    Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Husband:Â  Â Â \r\n      \r\n    No, sir, I donâ€™t have any.\r\n      \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    Wifeâ€™s counsel:Â \r\n      \r\n    Okay.Â  So you could go to work, \r\n      couldnâ€™t you?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Husband:\r\n      \r\n    Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we concur with the family \r\n  courtâ€™s reliance on the statutory valuation date. \r\n  [8] \r\nHusbandâ€™s final argument in connection \r\n  with his retirement benefits is the family courtâ€™s award to Wife of a portion \r\n  of his monthly benefits.Â  In this regard, the family court did precisely what \r\n  Husband requested.Â  It adopted Husbandâ€™s proposed equitable division, and in \r\n  so doing, rejected Wifeâ€™s efforts to avoid the monthly pay-out from Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement benefits.Â  Husband may not seek and receive a particular result at \r\n  trial and then challenge it on appeal.Â  See, e.g., Bazzle v. \r\n  Green Tree Fin. Corp., 351 S.C. 244, 255, 569 S.E.2d 349, 355 (2002), vacated \r\n  and remanded on other grounds by Green Tree Fin.Â  Corp. v. Bazzle, \r\n  123 S.Ct. 2402 (2003) (stating â€œ[t]he courts of this state have recognized that \r\n  a party cannot complain when it receives the relief for which it has asked.â€).\r\nÂ We find the family court did not \r\n  err in including Husbandâ€™s retirement plan in the marital estate.Â  Further, \r\n  we find there was no error in the valuation or apportionment of the plan.\r\nIII. Adequacy of Award of Attorney \r\nFees and Suit Monies \r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s \r\n  award of $7,048 in attorney fees and suit monies was inadequate.\r\nâ€œThe award of attorney fees in a \r\n  divorce action and the amount thereof are matters within the discretion of the \r\n  trial judge.â€Â  Sexton v. Sexton, 321 S.C. 487, 491, 469 S.E.2d 608, 611 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996) (citations omitted).Â  While we acknowledge that Husband incurred \r\n  litigation expenses in excess of the amount awarded, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  We affirm the family courtâ€™s award of attorney fees and suit monies in the amount \r\n  of $7,048.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J., concur.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s purchase money pension plan was, without objection, \r\n    included in the marital estate.Â  Regarding Wife, this appeal only concerns \r\n    her defined benefit plan that was created after the filing date of this action.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP, provides that judgments may be set aside \r\n    if there has been â€œnewly discovered evidence which by due diligence could \r\n    not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b) \r\n    . . . .â€Â  Under Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP, judgments may also be set aside for \r\n    â€œfraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party . . . .â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The family courtâ€™s error in concluding otherwise does not \r\n    require reversal.Â  As correctly determined by the family court, Husband could \r\n    have ascertained this information prior to trial.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  When invoked, the rules governing court procedures in general \r\n    and discovery in particular provide meaningful remedies and sanctions for \r\n    noncomplying parties and attorneys.Â  See, e.g., Rule 37, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The issue in this case is limited to the proper classification \r\n    of an asset, though we acknowledge that such deception may go well beyond \r\n    asset classification and include efforts to assign unreasonable values to \r\n    assets, as well as artificially portraying earnings and earning capacity.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œSouth Carolina courts construe the term â€˜propertyâ€™ very broadly.Â  \r\n    The term â€˜propertyâ€™ is a general term that is used to designate a right of \r\n    ownership and it includes every subject of whatever nature upon which the \r\n    right of ownership can legally attach, including choses in action.â€Â  Ball \r\n    v.

The agreement between Husband and SCE&amp;G anticipated a \r\n    reduced monthly benefit effective October 2005, which McKayâ€™s valuation recognizes.Â  \r\n    The third level of benefits begins in October 2008 when Husband reaches age \r\n    65.Â  Close scrutiny of McKayâ€™s detailed valuation demonstrates the exclusion \r\n    of the severance pay as well as those retirement benefits paid before the \r\n    valuation date.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We do, however, recognize that passive post-filing changes \r\n    in the appreciation or depreciation of marital assets may be considered by \r\n    the family court in determining an equitable apportionment of the marital \r\n    estate.Â  See Dixon v.

Bridges, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3727\r\n  Submitted December 8, 2003 â€“ Filed January 27, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Cynthia Barrier Castengera, of Newland, N.C. and David Dusty Rhoades, \r\n          of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Joseph P. Cerato, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.: In this domestic action, Janna Grooms Watkins Jenkins \r\n  (â€œWifeâ€) appeals the family courtâ€™s award of attorney fees and alimony, arguing \r\n  the amounts are insufficient and should have included post-judgment interest.Â  \r\n  Wife also appeals the family courtâ€™s decision awarding Wade M. Jenkins (â€œHusbandâ€) \r\n  a portion of Wifeâ€™s IRA, as well as reimbursement for sums expended on the marital \r\n  home.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS \r\nHusband and Wife were married in March 1987 and \r\n  separated in October 1997.Â  They have no children.Â  Husband instituted an action \r\n  for separate maintenance and support against Wife in January 1998.Â  The family \r\n  court granted the parties a divorce based on one yearâ€™s continuous separation, \r\n  ordered Husband to pay Wife $2,700 per month in rehabilitative alimony for one \r\n  year, equitably apportioned marital property, and awarded Wife $9,301.61 in \r\n  attorney fees.Â  After an appeal by Husband and cross-appeal by Wife, this court \r\n  affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.Â  This court ordered the family \r\n  court to award permanent periodic alimony instead of rehabilitative alimony; \r\n  to determine Husbandâ€™s entitlement to part of Wifeâ€™s IRA; to consider Husbandâ€™s \r\n  entitlement to reimbursement for certain sums paid; and to reconsider attorney \r\n  fees awarded to Wife. [1] Â  We denied Husbandâ€™s petition \r\n  for rehearing and the supreme court denied Husbandâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari.Â  \r\n\r\nOn remand, the family court awarded Wife $1,800 permanent periodic alimony \r\n  per month and ordered Husband to pay $200 per month toward his $23,400 alimony \r\n  arrearage; ordered Wife to pay Husband $2,250 for his share of Wifeâ€™s IRA; ordered \r\n  Wife to reimburse Husband $4,222.61; and ordered Husband to pay 75% of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  attorney fees.Â  The court did not award interest on the alimony arrearage or \r\n  Wifeâ€™s attorney fee award.Â  After Wifeâ€™s request for reconsideration, the court \r\n  ruled interest should run on the alimony arrearage from the date of the order \r\n  regarding remand.Â  The court again denied the award of interest on the attorney \r\n  fees.Â  Wife appeals.\r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has the authority to find facts \r\n  in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Greene \r\n  v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, 569 S.E.2d 393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This \r\n  broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family \r\n  court.Â  Id.Â  Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial \r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Dearybury \r\n  v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002). â€œAlimony is \r\n  a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  \r\n  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. \r\n  1988).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n I. Attorney Fees\r\nWife argues the family court \r\n  erred by not awarding her full attorney fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe award of attorney fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Smith v. \r\n  Smith, 308 S.C. 492, 496, 419 S.E.2d 232, 234-35 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  We find \r\n  the trial judge acted within her discretion in awarding Wife 75% of her attorney \r\n  fees and costs.Â  On remand from this court, the trial judge correctly considered \r\n  the factors for awarding attorney fees set out in Glasscock v. Glasscock, \r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991), particularly the beneficial results \r\n  obtained by Wifeâ€™s attorney.Â  Because the family court properly exercised its \r\n  discretion in awarding attorney fees, we affirm the award.\r\nII. Post-Judgment Interest on the Attorney Fee Award\r\n Wife contends the family court erred by not awarding post-judgment \r\n  interest on her award of attorney fees.Â  We agree.\r\n In Casey v. Casey, 311 S.C. 243, 428 S.E.2d 714 (1993), the supreme \r\n  court held post-judgment interest should apply to equitable distribution awards.Â  \r\n  Later, in Christy v. Christy, 317 S.C. 145, 452 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1994), \r\n  this court stated, â€œ[t]he cash award of attorneyâ€™s fees in this case is similar \r\n  to the fixed award of money in Casey and we see no reason to distinguish \r\n  the attorneyâ€™s fee award from the fixed equitable distribution money award.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 153, 452 S.E.2d at 5.Â  In Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. \r\n  96, 529 S.E.2d 14 (2000), the supreme court established the rule for post-judgment \r\n  interest in a case involving equitable distribution.Â  The court held, â€œwhen \r\n  a money judgment is finalized, whether in a lower court or in an appellate court, \r\n  the interest on that amount, whether it has been modified upward or downward \r\n  or remains the same, runs from the date of the original judgment.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 104, 529 S.E.2d at 19.Â  Based on the rule set out in Calhoun, and \r\n  the correlation made in Casey between attorney fees and equitable distribution \r\n  awards, we find Wife is entitled to post-judgment interest on her award of attorney \r\n  fees.\r\n South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (Supp. 2002) provides all money decrees \r\n  shall draw interest at the rate of 12% per year.Â  However, this statute was \r\n  amended, effective January 1, 2001; therefore, the 12% interest rate only applies \r\n  to causes of action arising or accruing on or after January 1, 2001.Â  2000 S.C. \r\n  Act No. 344, Â§ 4.Â  Because this action arose prior to January 1, 2001, the applicable \r\n  interest rate is 14% per annum.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (Supp. \r\n  2000).Â  Therefore, Wife is entitled to post-judgment interest on her attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee award at the rate of 14% per annum from date of entry.Â  We remand this issue \r\n  to the family court for a calculation of the amount of post-judgment interest \r\n  Husband owes on the attorney fees award.Â  \r\nIII. Alimony \r\nWife claims the family court erred in awarding her only $1,800 per month in \r\n  permanent periodic alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion \r\n  of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424&nbsp;(Ct. App. \r\n  2001). â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to \r\n  the marital relationship.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 \r\n  S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). â€œGenerally, alimony should place the supported \r\n  spouse, as nearly as practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during \r\n  the marriage.â€ Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424. â€œIt is the \r\n  duty of the family court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and \r\n  just if the claim is well founded.â€ Id. (citing Woodward v. Woodward, \r\n  294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 1987). TheÂ  trial court on \r\n  remand states it reviewed all factors (as required by case and statutory law).Â  \r\n  We find the family court acted within its discretion in awarding Wife $1,800 \r\n  per month permanent periodic alimony.Â  Considering the factors for making an \r\n  alimony award set out in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2002), especially \r\n  Wifeâ€™s bleak earning potential due to her outdated bookkeeping skills, compared \r\n  to Husbandâ€™s stable employment, we find the alimony award was proper.\r\nHusband argues in his brief this court should impute \r\n  income to Wife.Â Â  Although Husband disagrees with the finding that Wife is unemployable, \r\n  he did not appeal the award of alimony. Therefore, we may not address Husbandâ€™s \r\n  argument.Â  \r\nIV. Post-Judgment Interest on the Alimony Award \r\nWife argues the family court erred by failing to award post-judgment \r\n  interest on the alimony arrearage from the date of the original order.Â  We agree.\r\nWe find Wife is entitled to post-judgment interest on the alimony award.Â  Husband \r\n  made seven payments totaling $32,400, which constitutes only eighteen alimony \r\n  payments, although thirty-two months had elapsed.Â  Therefore, Husband owes interest \r\n  on thirteen past-due alimony payments.Â  Interest is due on alimony at the time \r\n  each support payment becomes due.Â  See Thornton v. Thornton, 328 \r\n  S.C. 96, 114, 492 S.E.2d 86, 96 (1997).Â  Accordingly, Wifeâ€™s post-judgment interest \r\n  on the alimony arrearage should be calculated from the date each payment was \r\n  due.Â  As stated above, according to 2000 S.C. Act No. 344, Â§ 4, the interest \r\n  rate on all money decrees regarding causes of action arising before January \r\n  1, 2001 is 14% per annum.Â  We remand this issue to the family court for a determination \r\n  of the amount of post-judgment interest Husband owes on the alimony arrearage.Â  \r\n\r\n V. Husbandâ€™s Entitlement to a Portion of Wifeâ€™s IRA \r\nWife contends the family court erred in not taking additional testimony regarding \r\n  whether contributions to Wifeâ€™s IRA were marital and in finding Husband is entitled \r\n  to a portion of the IRA.Â  We find additional testimony was not needed on this \r\n  issue and it was not error to award Husband 50% of the marital funds in the \r\n  IRA.Â  Wife testified at the final hearing in 1999 that she contributed to her \r\n  IRA during the marriage in the amount of $1,500 per year for three years.Â  This \r\n  court specifically referred to this testimony in its 2001 opinion.Â  Clearly, \r\n  because these funds were contributed during the marriage, they are marital property \r\n  to which Husband is partially entitled.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-472 to -473 \r\n  (Supp. 2002); Calhoun v. Calhoun, 331 S.C. 157, 175, 501 S.E.2d 735, \r\n  744-45 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating annuity in which wife invested during marriage \r\n  was part of marital estate and was subject to equitable distribution in divorce \r\n  action), affâ€™d in part, revâ€™d in part on other grounds, 339 S.C. 96, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 14 (2000).Â  Based on the above, we agree with the family court judgeâ€™s \r\n  finding that Husband is entitled to $2,250, or half of the marital property \r\n  in the IRA.Â  \r\nWife argues that if Husband is entitled to any \r\n  portion of Wifeâ€™s IRA, he is entitled to only the value of the marital \r\n  funds deposited, not the amount of funds deposited during the course \r\n  of the marriage. On remand, the family court determined it had correctly calculated \r\n  the amount of marital contributions made to the Wifeâ€™s IRA.Â  Husband refers \r\n  us to exhibits in the record showing that the value of the marital contributions \r\n  made to the IRA during the marriage was $9,308.89. That being the case, we fail \r\n  to see how Wife is prejudiced by the courtâ€™s finding that Husband is entitled \r\n  to only one-half of the amount of the contributions of $4,500.00.Â  Wife may \r\n  not complain of a ruling that does not prejudice her.Â  State v. Abney, \r\n  109 S.C. 102, 103, 95 S.E. 179, 180 (1918).\r\nHusband argues he should receive more from the \r\n  IRA due to an additional $875 he claims was marital property.Â  Because Husband \r\n  did not appeal, we do not address this argument.\r\nVI. Reimbursement to Husband \r\nWife claims Husband is not entitled to the $4,222 reimbursement ordered by \r\n  the family court.Â  We find, while Husband is entitled to some reimbursement, \r\n  he is only entitled to one-half of the amount ordered by the family court.Â  \r\n\r\nHusband paid $4,222.61 to redeem the marital home out of foreclosure and pay \r\n  the mortgage payments through December 2001.Â  Because the marital home is considered \r\n  marital property, both Husband and Wife were jointly responsible for making \r\n  the mortgage payments on the home.Â  Therefore, we find Husband is entitled to \r\n  $2,111 reimbursement from Wife.Â  We find this amount, which represents half \r\n  of the amount spent by Husband on the mortgage payments, is a fair reimbursement \r\n  to Husband because the expenses of the marital home, as marital property, should \r\n  be equally shared by Husband and Wife.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Jenkins v.

Swerling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney Charles H. Richardson and \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold W. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  John R. Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Bynum Rayfield was charged \r\n  with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, three counts of committing \r\n  a lewd act upon a child, and one count of contributing to the delinquency of \r\n  a minor.Â  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced \r\n  to an aggregate term of thirty years imprisonment. Rayfield appeals, arguing \r\n  the circuit court erred in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson \r\n  [1]  motion and in charging the jury that the testimony of victims â€œneed \r\n  not be corroborated.â€Â  We affirm. \r\n  [2] \r\nFACTS\r\nRayfield was accused of sexually \r\n  abusing his two stepdaughters, hisÂ  daughter, and two neighborhood girls who \r\n  were friends with his stepdaughters and daughter.Â  All of the girls were minors \r\n  and testified as to Rayfieldâ€™s sexual misconduct.Â  Rayfield denied any misconduct.Â  \r\n  The jury found Rayfield guilty of all charges, and he was sentenced.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Batson Issue\r\nRayfield argues the trial court erred in granting \r\n  the Stateâ€™s motion under Batson.Â  We agree, but we are constrained to \r\n  conclude that Rayfield ultimately was not legally prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  error.\r\nDuring the initial jury selection, Rayfield, through \r\n  counsel, employed peremptory strikes against five prospective jurors.Â  Four \r\n  of the five prospective jurors struck were female.  [3] Â  The State introduced its Batson \r\n  objection by indicating that defense counsel should be required to put forward \r\n  a race and gender-neutral explanation for his strikes.Â  The State noted, â€œthat \r\n  of the selected jurors there are nine males [and] three females â€¦.â€  \r\n  [4] Â  It further indicated that the motion â€œconcerned . . . the strikes \r\n  of the white females.â€Â  The State specifically identified Juror #17, a white \r\n  female, as â€œconcern[ing] the State the most.â€Â  \r\nDefense counsel provided the trial court with \r\n  the basis for striking each of the prospective female jurors.Â  The trial court \r\n  deemed these explanations â€œrace and gender neutral.â€Â  As discussed more fully \r\n  below, the trial court found a Batson violation with respect to the only \r\n  male, Juror #70, struck by defense counsel. [5] Â  The first jury was quashed and â€œa redraw of \r\n  the juryâ€ followed.Â  \r\nThe ensuing â€œredrawâ€ resulted in no Batson \r\n  challenge, and significantly, none of the jurors struck by defense counsel during \r\n  the initial jury selection were seated on the second jury. [6] \r\nâ€œThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire \r\n  person on the basis of race or gender.â€Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, \r\n  615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  The purpose of Batson is to â€œprotect \r\n  the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial by a jury of the defendantâ€™s peers, protect \r\n  each venirepersonâ€™s right not to be excluded from jury service for discriminatory \r\n  reasons, and preserve public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice \r\n  by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection process.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 628-629, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1999).Â  Both the State \r\n  and defendants are prohibited from discriminatorily exercising a peremptory \r\n  challenge of a prospective juror.Â  Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, \r\n  58 (1992).Â  The trial court must conduct a Batson hearing â€œwhen members \r\n  of a cognizable racial group or gender are struck and the opposing party requests \r\n  a hearing.â€Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 8, 512 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1999).\r\nOur supreme court has set forth the following \r\n  procedure for a Batson hearing:\r\n\r\nAfter a party objects to a jury strike, the proponent of \r\n  the strike must offer a facially race-neutral [or gender-neutral] explanation.Â  \r\n  This explanation is not required to be persuasive or even plausible.Â  Once the \r\n  proponent states a reason that is race-neutral [or gender-neutral], the burden \r\n  is on the party challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, \r\n  either by showing similarly situated members of another race [or the other gender] \r\n  were seated on the jury or the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally \r\n  implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.\r\n\r\nState v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 64, 512 S.E.2d \r\n  500, 503 (1999).Â  \r\nWhether a Batson violation has occurred \r\n  must be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, and â€œthe \r\n  opponent of the strike carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court \r\n  the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner.â€Â  Shuler, \r\n  344 S.C. at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810.Â  With regard to a Batson motion, \r\n  â€œ[a]ppellate courts give the trial courtâ€™s finding great deference on appeal, \r\n  and review the trial courtâ€™s ruling with a clearly erroneous standard.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  When the record, however, does not support the reason upon which the trial court \r\n  has based his findings,Â  â€œthose findings will be overturned.â€Â  Tucker, \r\n  334 S.C. at 9, 512 S.E.2d at 103.\r\nRayfieldâ€™s counsel offered two reasons for striking \r\n  Juror #70:Â  (1) â€œhe was retired [and] I didnâ€™t have information from what he \r\n  was retired;â€ and (2) his â€œconservativeâ€ appearance.Â  \r\nHere, the trial court followed the Stateâ€™s lead and \r\n  disregarded defense counselâ€™s explanation that he struck juror #70 due to his \r\n  conservativeÂ  appearance.Â  Our courts, as well as other jurisdictions, have \r\n  consistently found a prospective jurorâ€™s demeanor and appearance asÂ  nondiscriminatory \r\n  reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge of the juror.Â  See Tucker, \r\n  334 S.C. at 8, 512 S.E.2d at 102 (finding no violation of Batson where \r\n  State struck juror because he was argumentative and his answers were â€œdogmaticâ€); \r\n  State v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 538, 413 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1991) (holding \r\n  that counsel may strike a juror based on demeanor and disposition); State \r\n  v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 309, 519 S.E.2d 793, 797 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding \r\n  no discriminatory intent inherent in defense counselâ€™s explanation for striking \r\n  jurors who appeared to counsel as â€œlooking in a â€˜mean,â€™ â€˜sternâ€™ or â€˜accusatoryâ€™ \r\n  mannerâ€); State v. Guess, 318 S.C. 269, 273, 457 S.E.2dÂ  6, 8 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995) (noting that demeanor has been upheld in many jurisdictions as a legitimate \r\n  reason to strike a juror (citing Lockett v. State,Â  517 So.2d 1346 (Miss. \r\n  1987)); see also Jones v. State, No. 05-02-00357, 2003 WL 21649964, \r\n  at 3 (Tex. Crim. App. July 15, 2003) (upholding trial courtâ€™s denial of defendantâ€™s \r\n  Batson motion where Stateâ€™s explanation for striking juror was that the \r\n  juror wore leather clothing and had a â€œvery liberal outward appearanceâ€). \r\nAlthough not argued by the State, we note South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  rejection of the â€œdual motivation doctrine in the Batson context.â€Â  See \r\n  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 59, 495 S.E.2d 205, 210 (1998) (noting \r\n  that South Carolina follows the â€œtaintedâ€ approach whereby a discriminatory \r\n  explanation for the exercise of a preemptory challenge will vitiate other nondiscriminatory \r\n  explanations for the strike).Â  Consequently, Rayfieldâ€™s counselâ€™s stated reliance \r\n  on the appearance of Juror #70 will not cure a discriminatory purpose.Â  The \r\n  question then becomes whether, under our deferential standard of review, the \r\n  record sustains the trial courtâ€™s determination that Juror #70 was struck because \r\n  of his gender.Â  We find the record contains no evidence indicating Juror #70 \r\n  was struck because he is a male.\r\nThe Stateâ€™s disjointed and moving-target approach to \r\n  its Batson motion created confusion.Â  The State began its motion with \r\n  a reference to Juror #17, a white female, requesting a â€œrace and gender-neutral \r\n  explanationâ€ for the strike.Â  On the heels of informing the trial court that \r\n  its focus was the striking of white females, the State mentioned Juror #70, \r\n  the sole male struck by defense counsel.Â  The colloquy returned to the gravamen \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, the striking of females, especially Juror \r\n  #17 which â€œconcern[ed] the state the most.â€Â  During the argument, the State \r\n  repeatedly assigned discriminatory motives to defense counsel in striking females.Â  \r\n  When the trial court determined that defense counselâ€™s reasons for striking \r\n  the females were nondiscriminatory, the State resurrected its challenge to Juror \r\n  #70.Â  Defense counsel reiterated his position that â€œjuror [#70] appeared to \r\n  be a very conservative individual, to me . . . he just appeared fromÂ  appearance \r\n  that he would be the type likely to side with the State.â€Â  The trial court ignored \r\n  defense counselâ€™s reliance on this jurorâ€™s conservative appearance and granted \r\n  the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, finding Juror #70 was struck because he was \r\n  a male: â€œThe only reason given for striking Juror #70 â€¦ is that he was retired \r\n  â€¦ but you allowed Juror #36 [a female] to serve [who was also retired] â€¦ Iâ€™m \r\n  going to find that [in regard to Juror #70] that was not a gender neutral reason.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAs noted, the first jury was comprised of nine males \r\n  and three females.Â  Defense counsel used the allotted number of strikes, exercising \r\n  all but one against females.Â  Clearly, Rayfieldâ€™s counsel was not discriminating \r\n  against males.Â  The totality of the facts and circumstances compels a finding \r\n  that no gender based discrimination was associated with the striking of Juror \r\n  #70. Defense counsel asserted to the trial court: â€œ[T]heyâ€™re complaining I was \r\n  striking all these females and seating all these men, and then thereâ€™s one man \r\n  I strike â€¦ [and] out of all these jurors, itâ€™s certainly not a pattern of discrimination \r\n  against men.â€Â  We agree and find absolutely no gender based discrimination in \r\n  the exercise of a preemptory challenge against Juror #70.Â  We therefore find \r\n  that the reasons asserted for the strike of Juror #70 were gender neutral, and \r\n  the State fell short of demonstrating purposeful gender based discrimination.Â  \r\n  It was error for the trial court to grant the Stateâ€™s Batson motion.Â  \r\n\r\nWe nevertheless find no reversible error pursuant to \r\n  the supreme court precedent of State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d \r\n  366 (1996).Â  In Adams, the trial court erred in granting the Stateâ€™s \r\n  Batson motion and quashing the jury.Â  Because the jury ultimately selected \r\n  had none of the persons defense counsel struck from the first jury panel, the \r\n  supreme court found â€œno prejudice resulted from the judgeâ€™s errorâ€ and affirmed \r\n  Adamsâ€™ convictions.Â  Id. at 126, 480 S.E.2d at 373.Â  In so holding, the \r\n  court in Adams recognized that no jurorâ€™s equal protection rights are \r\n  violated where the trial court improperly quashes a jury panel.Â  In addition, \r\n  the court in Adams referenced the settled principle that â€œ[a] defendant \r\n  has no right to trial by any particular jury.â€ Id.Â  But cf.Â  \r\n  Ford, 334 S.C. at 66, 512 S.E.2d at 504 (holding that reversal and granting \r\n  of a new trial is a proper remedy where the trial court erred in finding defendant \r\n  violated Batson in striking certain jurors and any challenged \r\n  juror was seated on the second jury). [7] \r\nII. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Charge Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.Â§16-3-657\r\nRayfield argues the trial court erred in charging the jury \r\n  that the testimony of the victims â€œneed not be corroboratedâ€ pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-657 (Supp. 2002). We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is required to charge the correct \r\n  law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Peer, 320 S.C. 546, 553, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  375, 380 (1996).Â  Jury instructions should be considered as a whole, and if \r\n  as a whole they are free from error, any isolated portions which may be misleading \r\n  do not constitute reversible error.Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 422, \r\n  405 S.E.2d 384 (1991).Â  The substance of the law is what must be instructed \r\n  to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, \r\n  462, 272 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1980).\r\nThe trial court instructed \r\n  the jury that section 16-3-657 provides that â€œthe testimony of a victim need \r\n  not be corroborated.â€Â  The challenged charge withstood appellate scrutiny in \r\n  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 509, 435 S.E.2d 859, 863 (1993).Â  We \r\n  consequently find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s instruction to the \r\n  jury regarding the corroboration of the victimsâ€™ testimony.Â  Consistent with \r\n  Schumpert, we note the trial court: (1) properly instructed the jury \r\n  that they were the sole finders of fact with the discretion to determine the \r\n  credibility of the witnesses; (2) correctly charged our stateâ€™s constitutional \r\n  mandate prohibiting the court from commenting on the facts and stated: â€œThe \r\n  law does not permit me to have an opinion about the facts in this case;â€Â  and \r\n  (3) correctly charged the Stateâ€™s burden of proof.Â  While the section 16-3-657 \r\n  charge is not mandatory, such charge does not constitute reversible error when \r\n  the Schumpert safeguards are present.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHaving determined that Rayfieldâ€™s appeal is controlled \r\n  by the supreme court precedent of State v. Adams and State v. Schumpert, \r\n  respectively, the judgment of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,Â  and HOWARD, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Batson v.

In total, Rayfieldâ€™s trial counsel struck six \r\n    prospective jurors, five of whom are female.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The first jury was comprised of eight blacks and four whites.Â  The \r\n    first alternate is a white male, and the second alternate is a black female.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  While Juror #70 was the only male struck by the defense, the State \r\n    struck only males.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Defense counsel struck two of the four females who were successfully \r\n    challenged in the initial jury selection process.Â  Juror #70 was not drawn \r\n    for the second jury.Â  The second jury was comprised of eight whites and four \r\n    blacks, and the gender makeup was altered as well, as the second jury was \r\n    comprised of seven males and five females.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7] Â  We acknowledge Rayfieldâ€™s concern with the loss of a properly selected \r\n    jury, and the concomitant desire of the State to avoid a particular jury for \r\n    a variety of reasons connected to the Stateâ€™s perceptions of its chances of \r\n    obtaining a guilty verdict.Â Â  The application of the holding in Adams \r\n    may, in some cases, allow the State to benefit from its pursuit of a meritless \r\n    Batson motion by providing it with another opportunity to draw a jury \r\n    more to its liking.Â  We are, however, bound to apply the holding in Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3729","title":"Vogt v.

Vogt appeals \r\n  from an adverse jury verdict in a personal injury action.Â Â Â  The dispositive \r\n  issue on appeal is Vogtâ€™s status as a licensee or an invitee.Â  The trial court \r\n  ruled that Vogt was a mere social guest and hence a licensee.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nVogt was injured as a result of a diving board/swimming pool accident at the \r\n  Murraywood Swim and Racket Club (â€œMurraywoodâ€).Â  He commenced this action asserting \r\n  causes of action for negligence and strict liability. \r\n  [1]  Â Murraywood answered denying liability and alleging various \r\n  defenses, including comparative negligence.\r\nMurraywood is a private, nonprofit pool and tennis \r\n  facility operated by and for a group of homeowners in Lexington County.Â  The \r\n  facility is equally co-owned by its members.Â  The facility is not open \r\n  to the public at large, for it only allows non-members to use the facilities \r\n  in two situations.Â  Non-members may either rent the facilities for private use, \r\n  or attend as a guest of a member.Â  \r\nOn June 28, 1998, Vogt was invited to Murraywood as a social guest of Don Pevey \r\n  and Lynne Soobitsky.Â  After consuming alcohol at the home of Pevey and Soobitsky, \r\n  the group walked to the pool.Â  Vogt decided to dive into the pool via Murraywoodâ€™s \r\n  three-meter high diving board. Â His first dive went without incident.Â  Approximately \r\n  thirty minutes later, Vogt decided to attempt a swan dive off the same diving \r\n  board.Â  After entering the water, Vogt struck his head on the bottom of the \r\n  pool and was injured. Â This action followed.\r\nThe Murraywood pool was constructed in 1975.Â  Before \r\n  trial, Murraywood made a motion in limine seeking to establish \r\n  that operation of the pool was controlled by regulations promulgated in 1971 \r\n  by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental ControlÂ  (â€œDHECâ€).Â  \r\n  Vogt sought to introduce more recent DHEC standards as well as standards promulgated \r\n  by other organizations as evidence of a common law standard of care.Â  The trial \r\n  court found that the 1971 DHEC regulations were the only applicable regulations \r\n  concerning the operation of the Murraywood pool.Â  It nevertheless permitted \r\n  Vogtâ€™s expert, in rendering his opinion, to rely on and reference the more recent \r\n  DHEC regulations and industry standards.\r\nBefore instructing the jury, the trial judge ruled \r\n  that Vogt was a licensee.Â  As such, she declined to charge the jury with the \r\n  law applicable to an invitee.Â  The trial court further refused Vogtâ€™s request \r\n  to specifically charge the DHEC standards other than those in effect at the \r\n  time the pool was constructed in 1975, although the court expressly authorized \r\n  the jury to consider the opinion testimony of expert witnesses.Â  Vogtâ€™s expert \r\n  witness relied on more recent DHEC regulations and current industry standards.\r\n\r\n  ISSUES \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      Did the trial court err in concluding as a \r\n        matter of law that Vogt was a licensee?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n      Did \r\n        the trial court err in refusing to charge certain â€œrequests to charge,â€ \r\n        including the law relating to an invitee and post-1971 DHEC regulations?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Invitee/Licensee \r\nVogt argues it was error for \r\n  the trial court to rule that he was a licensee as a matter of law.Â  Acknowledging \r\n  that the facts are not in dispute and that a question of law is presented, Vogt \r\n  maintains he was an invitee.Â  Specifically, Vogt contends that because Murraywood \r\n  typically charged non-members a two-dollar admission fee, and limited the number \r\n  of times a guest could visit, the operation of the Murraywood pool facility \r\n  is analogous to a business charging admission.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has defined a licensee \r\n  as â€œa person who is privileged to enter upon land by virtue of the possessorâ€™s \r\n  consent.â€Â  Neil v. Byrum, 288 S.C. 472, 473, 343 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1986); \r\n  see also Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 720, 541 S.E.2d 857, 864 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001); and F.P. Hubbard &amp; R.L. Felix, The South Carolina Law \r\n  of Torts 111 (2d ed.1997).Â  When a licensee enters onto the property of \r\n  another, it is for his or her benefit and not that of the landowner.Â  Sims, \r\n  343 S.C. at 720, 541 S.E.2d at 863.Â  The duties a landowner owes to a licensee \r\n  are to use reasonable care to (a) â€œdiscover him and avoid injury to him in carrying \r\n  on activities upon the landâ€; and (b) â€œwarn him of any concealed dangerous conditions \r\n  or activities which are known to the possessor.â€Â  Neil, 288 S.C. at 473, \r\n  343 S.E.2d at 616 (citations ommitted).Â  \r\nBy contrast, â€œ[a]n invitee is a person who comes on \r\n  the premises with express or implied permission and for the purpose of benefiting \r\n  the owner/occupier.â€Â  Hubbard &amp; Felix at 112; Sims, 343 S.C. at 713, \r\n  541 S.E.2d at 860.Â  A landowner owes an invitee a duty of due to care to discover \r\n  risks and to warn of or make safe existing unreasonable risks.Â  Hubbard &amp; \r\n  Felix at 114.Â Â  \r\nIn Neil, the supreme court held that a social guest is a licensee.Â  \r\n  Neil, 288 S.C. at 473, 343 S.E.2d at 616 (citations omitted).Â  Comment \r\n  three to the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 330(h) (1965) further explains \r\n  the distinction between social guests/licensees and invitees:\r\n\r\n  Some confusion has resulted from the fact that, although a social guest normally \r\n    is invited, and even urged to come, he is not an â€œinvitee,â€ within the legal \r\n    meaning of that term, as stated in Â§ 332.Â  He does not come as a member of \r\n    the public upon premises held open to the public for that purpose, and he \r\n    does not enter for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with the business \r\n    dealings of the possessor.Â  The use of the premises is extended to him merely \r\n    as a personal favor to him.\r\n\r\nIn Landry v. Hilton Head Prop. \r\n  Owners Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 200, 202, 452 S.E.2d 619, 620 (Ct. App. 1994), a \r\n  homeowner was injured while walking in the common areas of her gated community.Â  \r\n  This court held that because Landry was a dues-paying member of the property \r\n  ownersâ€™ association, she had the right to use the common areas without \r\n  the associationâ€™s permission.Â  Id. at 204, 452 S.E.2d at 621.Â  As such, \r\n  she was characterized as an invitee.Â  Id.Â  Conversely, we believe that \r\n  a guest of a dues-paying member enters not by right, but by the permission of \r\n  the member.Â  \r\nBy his own admission, Vogt entered the pool facilities as a social guest of \r\n  club members Soobitsky and Peavy.Â  Even assuming Murraywood did charge Vogt \r\n  a two-dollar admission fee [2]  and limited the number of times \r\n  he could visit, [3]  this does not affect the analysis \r\n  of whether he was a licensee or invitee.Â  The more appropriate issue is whether \r\n  he had a right to use Murraywoodâ€™s facilities.Â  The obvious conclusion is that \r\n  he did not.Â  In fact, his presence was entirely permissive.Â  Thus, it is clear \r\n  that Vogt did not â€œenter for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with \r\n  the business dealings of the possessor.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 330(h).Â  \r\n\r\nOrdinarily, when conflicting evidence is presented as to whether someone is \r\n  a licensee or invitee, the question becomes one of fact and as such, is properly \r\n  left to the jury.Â  See Hoover v. Broome, 324 S.C. 531, 537-38, \r\n  479 S.E.2d 62, 66 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, based on the record in this case, \r\n  we find no conflict in the evidence regarding Vogtâ€™s status at the time of the \r\n  incident.Â  Moreover, it is undisputed that Vogt visited the pool only because \r\n  members invited him and his presence at the pool was entirely permissive.Â  Vogt \r\n  concedes on appeal that the facts are undisputed, yet contends the facts compel \r\n  a different conclusion as a matter of law.Â  We disagree, and find the undisputed \r\n  evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that Vogt was a licensee. \r\n  [4] \r\n II. Requests to Charge\r\nVogt next contends that the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to charge the jury with certain requests to charge.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nThe trial court judge must charge the current and \r\n  correct law to the jury.Â  McCourt ex rel. McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. \r\n  301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995); Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, \r\n  349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œWhen reviewing a jury charge for \r\n  alleged error, an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light \r\n  of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 \r\n  S.C. 279, 311, 536 S.E.2d 408, 425 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Keaton ex rel. \r\n  Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999)).Â  \r\n  A trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a properly requested charge is reversible error \r\n  only where the requesting party can demonstrate prejudice from the refusal.Â  \r\n  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289.\r\nFirst, requests to charge A-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \r\n  and 7 are premised on Vogtâ€™s purported status as an invitee.Â  Having \r\n  concluded the trial court correctly determined Vogt was a licensee as a matter \r\n  of law, these requests were properly denied.Â  \r\nSecond, the failure to charge Vogtâ€™s request to \r\n  charge 10-A was not error and, in any event, resulted in no prejudice.Â  In his \r\n  request to charge 10-A, Vogt asked the trial court to charge the jury with 1995 \r\n  DHEC swimming pool regulations 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-51(J)(11)(h) and \r\n  24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-51(27)(b), which were in effect at the time of Vogtâ€™s \r\n  accident.Â  The applicability of regulation 61-51(J)(11)(h), is controlled by \r\n  paragraph one of that section, which provides in pertinent part that â€œ[a]ll \r\n  pools and pool equipment must be operated and maintained in accordance with \r\n  the permitted plans and specifications or approved change order.â€Â  (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The plans and specifications for the Murraywood pool were approved \r\n  by DHEC in 1975 when the pool was constructed.Â  The pool has been inspected \r\n  annually since then, and at all times its compliance has been determined under \r\n  the DHEC regulations enacted in 1971.Â  \r\nSimilarly, the applicability of regulation 61-51(C)(27)(b), \r\n  is controlled by 61-51(C)(1), which reads â€œ[r]equirements of this section are \r\n  applicable to all new construction and alterations of existing swimming pools.â€Â  \r\n  Considering that this statute was enacted twenty years after the construction \r\n  of the Murraywood pool, and that no alterations have ever been made to the pool, \r\n  the regulation does not apply to the Murraywood pool.Â  Accordingly, because \r\n  we find that neither of the requested regulations applied to the Murraywood \r\n  pool, we hold that the trial court was correct to deny Vogtâ€™s request to charge \r\n  10-A.\r\nMoreover, Vogt was not prejudiced by the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s refusal to charge the requested instructions.Â  The trial court extended \r\n  wide latitude to Vogt, through expert testimony and otherwise, to establish \r\n  negligence against Murraywood.Â  For example, Robert Taylor, Vogtâ€™s expert, relied \r\n  on the 1995 DHEC Regulations in rendering his opinion that the swimming pool \r\n  lacked sufficient depth in the diving area.Â  The trial courtâ€™s charge clearly \r\n  permitted the jury to weigh and consider such evidence in reaching its verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that the trial \r\n  court correctly determined as a matter of law that Vogt was a licensee.Â  Similarly, \r\n  we hold that the trial court was correct to refuse Vogtâ€™s requests to charge \r\n  as they pertained to the duty owed to invitees and DHEC Regulations, which were \r\n  inapplicable to the Murraywood pool.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The strict liability cause of action was withdrawn and Vogt \r\n    proceeded on the negligence claim.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is no evidence in the record to suggest the fee was \r\n    paid.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Murraywoodâ€™s pool rules and regulations limited a local guest \r\n    to â€œ10 visits per swim season.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We note that this issue reaches us in an unusual posture for \r\n    the purposes of ascertaining the proper standard of review.Â  At trial, Vogt \r\n    made a motion for a directed verdict seeking a determination that he was an \r\n    invitee.Â  Murraywood opposed the motion, contending the facts compelled a \r\n    finding that Vogt was a licensee.Â  The trial judge denied Vogtâ€™s directed \r\n    verdict motion and, in the course of the charge conference, ruled that Vogt \r\n    was a licensee as a matter of law.Â  During oral argument, Vogt rejected any \r\n    suggestion that a factual dispute existed, necessitating submission of Vogtâ€™s \r\n    status to the jury.Â  Cf.Â  Hoover v. Broome, 324 S.C. at 537-38, \r\n    479 S.E.2d at 66 (concluding that when conflicting evidence is presented as \r\n    to whether someone is a licensee or invitee, the question becomes one of fact \r\n    and as such, is properly left to the jury).Â  The parties here stipulate a \r\n    legal question is presented, and we follow their proposed standard of review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
