Shortly thereafter, Melanie discovered she was pregnant and informed Roe.Â  On June 16, 2004, Melanie entered a drug rehabilitation center where she stayed until September 2, 2004.Â  While she was in rehabilitation, Roe visited her and called her on the phone.Â  The parties disagreed on the number of visitsâ€”Melanie estimated six visits, Roe recalled twelve or thirteen.Â  By early August, the calls and visits suddenly stopped.Â  Melanie averred:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         In the beginning, he called a lot, but he just quit calling and quit coming, and I didnâ€™t know what happened to him.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Before you got out, recognizing you got out September 2nd, â€™04, how much before the time that you got outâ€”how many days or weeks or months did he stop coming to visit or stop calling?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         About a month.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Had yâ€™all had this falling out or something?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No.Â  He showed up with a card and a pack of cigarettes.Â  And, the lady there told meâ€”he didnâ€™t even see me, it was Wednesday; it was not visit day; Thursday was visit day.Â  And, when I came backâ€”I think I was in class or something, but when I came back to where we lived, she gave me the card and the cigarettes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         That was it?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         I never heard from him again until December.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n During the time that Roe did visit, he gave Melanie some money, brought her cigarettes, and took her out for food on several occasions. Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         . . .

\r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         And, I think you estimated on how many occasions during the time he came?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         We went to Subway twice and, on a Sunday, he brought me KFC once.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Subway

\r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         And, Twenty Bucks?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Could it have been Thirty Bucks?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         It could have been Thirty Bucks.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Could it have been Fifty Bucks?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No, it wasnâ€™t.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         That was just one time, and it was in cash.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Yesâ€”well, no, he mainly gave me Ten and Twenty on different occasions, but it was not more than Fifty Dollars altogether.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nRoe confessed, â€œI gave her very little money while she was in there,â€ but estimated he gave her between fifty and one hundred dollars.Â  He averred he brought her cigarettes and soda â€œjust about every week.â€Â Â Â  \r\nMelanie left the rehabilitation center on September 2.Â  After staying one night with a friend, and several nights with her brother, she returned to her motherâ€™s home in Gaffney, South Carolina.Â  On September 7, Melanie obtained phone service in her name at her motherâ€™s residence.Â  Melanie tried unsuccessfully to reach Roe by phone on several occasions, calling Roeâ€™s mother and wife to no avail.Â  For approximately two weeks in October, Melanie moved out from her motherâ€™s house and stayed with her brother Adam and his girlfriend Carla.Â  She returned to her motherâ€™s in Gaffney and stayed there until December 3, 2004, when she moved back in with Adam and Carla.Â  \r\nAlthough Melanie avoided DSS, she declared she never attempted to evade Roe.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Have you ever failed to answer the door for Roe?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Roe never knocked on the door.Â  We knew who was at the door all the time.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Did you ever hide from Roe?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No, I did not.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMelanieâ€™s brother, Adam, and Adamâ€™s girlfriend, Carla, confirmed that Melanie never hid from Roe, but rather attempted to contact him.Â  Adam testified as follows at trial:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         At any time when you were staying with your mom and with Melanie at Kendrick Street, were you aware of any steps that were made to try to hide Melanie from Roe?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         No, sir.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Are you aware of any steps that were taken from Melanie to find Roe?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         A few.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         What were you aware of that was done?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         I was aware of her few phone calls that were made.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Did you ever make any phone calls?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         One or two.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCarla provided a similar account:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Were you aware of any veil of secrecy or any kind of concerted effort that was made to hide the pregnancy from Roe?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n        No.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Are you aware of any steps that were taken actually to locate Roe during this period of time?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         What were you aware of?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         Melanie had used the phone a couple of times trying to call.Â  She couldnâ€™t get through.Â  Adam had called a couple of times and couldnâ€™t get through.Â  They just couldnâ€™t find him.Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, the evidence does suggest that Roe hid from Melanie.Â  Adam recounted a time in December when he had a chance encounter with Roe.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         What happened that day?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         Roe drove up the street.Â  I was outside.Â  He stopped to talk to me.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         What did Roe say?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         He asked me if I knew where my sister was.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         What did you say to him?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         I asked him where he wasâ€”where he had been, Iâ€™m sorry.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         What was his response to that?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;\r\n         He said he was trying to hide out.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCarla described an occasion when Roe stopped at the service station where Adam and Carla worked.Â  She averred: â€œ. . . I had asked at one point â€˜[W]hat happened to you, Roe; you just disappeared?â€™Â  And, he kind of looked down and said: â€˜That was my plan.â€™â€Â  \r\nFrom December 3 until Jay was born Melanie stayed with her brother.Â  Roe spoke with Melanieâ€™s brother and left a card and a pillow for her sometime in December.Â  The card read, â€œ21 More Day[s],â€ a statement apparently intended to mislead Melanie into believing Roe was soon to be divorced from his wife.Â  \r\nOn January 3, 2005, Roe stopped by Adamâ€™s trailer to install a car battery.Â  Melanie was there, and Roe stayed for approximately fifteen minutes.Â  According to Roe, â€œshe showed me a picture of the ultrasound and I told her I didnâ€™t really have time; I just wanted to make sure she was O. K.â€Â  Melanie testified:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         At that time, did he stay a long time?Â  Did he talk to you about the baby and your plans together?Â  Did yâ€™all sit down and â€“what happened?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         I was sitting on the couch; I showed him the ultrasound; he helped me with the battery in the car.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Did he leave you any money?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         No.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Did he come back after that January 3rd visit again before the baby was born?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         No, he did not.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Had you left the Evans Trailer Park?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         No, he told me that he would be back, and he never came back.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMelanie did not see Roe again until after she gave birth.Â  On February 12, 2005, after learning of the suit for adoption by the Does, Roe purchased several items including blankets, pacifiers, and a diaper bag from Target.Â  \r\nThe family court ruled that Roe was aware that Melanie was pregnant, knew of her location, and was informed that she was considering the option of adoption.Â  According to the court, Roe â€œabdicated his responsibility to Melanie and to the unborn child.â€Â  Therefore, the court found his consent to the adoption was not required and terminated his parental rights.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 569 S.E.2d 367 (2002); Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 612 S.E.2d 456 (Ct. App. 2005); Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 612 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App. 2005); Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 603 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992)).Â Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Holler v. Holler, 364 S.C. 256, 261, 612 S.E.2d 469, 472 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Lacke v.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  Roe did not provide a reasonable sum for the support of the child or for expenses incurred in connection with Melanieâ€™s pregnancy as outlined in the statute.Â  However, under certain limited circumstances, our courts will excuse an unwed father for failure to meet the requirements of the statute.Â Â  \r\nB.Â  Abernathy and Its Progeny\r\nThe seminal case of Abernathy v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 437 S.E.2d 25 (1993), held that even though an unwed father fails to meet the literal requirements of section 20-7-1690, he may nonetheless be afforded constitutional protection when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and to comply with the statute.Â  The biological mother and father in Abernathy began a â€œcasual sexual relationshipâ€ while both were on active duty in the Navy.Â  313 S.C. at 29, 437 S.E.2d at 27.Â  Soon after Julie and Mitchell discovered Julie was pregnant, Mitchell was forced to leave for sea duty.Â  He gave Julie use of his car and access to his bank account, and offered to send her to college while he stayed home to care for the child.Â  Julie, however, decided she did not want to be involved with Mitchell.Â  She put the car in storage and used the bank account only to store the car and to pay a speeding ticket fine for Mitchell.Â  Upon Mitchellâ€™s return from sea Julie â€œrebuffed his advances and rejected his offer of marriage. . . . Julie thereafter avoided contact with Mitchell, refused his telephone calls, and â€˜was kind of hiding away from him.â€™â€Â  Id.Â Â  Mitchell received notice that Julie had given birth and that the Abernathys had commenced an action to adopt the child.Â  Mitchell contested the adoption.Â  The trial court determined he possessed the right to refuse consent to the adoption.Â  Our supreme court affirmed.\r\n\r\nFirst, the appellants maintained â€œan unwed fatherâ€™s consent to adoption is not required unless he complies with the literal requirements of section 20- 7-1690(A)(5)(b), which mandates that a father provide for the support of his child before the State is compelled to seek his consent to the adoption of the child.â€Â  313 S.C. at 31, 437 S.E.2d at 28.Â  The court did not agree:\r\n\r\n The United States Supreme Court has recognized that an unwed father may possess a relationship with his child that is entitled to constitutional protection.Â  Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972).Â  However, â€œparental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child. They require relationships more enduring.â€Â  Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 260, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2992, 77 L.Ed.2d 614, 626 (1983) (quoting Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 99 S.Ct. 1760, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979)).Â  Thus, an unwed father must demonstrate a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by coming forward to participate in the rearing of his child before his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial constitutional protection.Â  Id., 463 U.S. at 261, 103 S.Ct. at 2993, 77 L.Ed.2d at 626.Â  The mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection.Â  Id.\r\n When a child is first born, an unwed father possesses an â€œopportunity no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring.â€Â  Id. at 262, 103 S.Ct. at 2993, 77 L.Ed.2d at 627.Â  However, this opportunity interest is constitutionally protected only to the extent that the biological father who claims protection wants to make the commitments and perform the responsibilities that give rise to a developed relationship, because it is only the combination of biology and custodial responsibility that the Constitution ultimately protects.Â  E. Buchanan, The Constitutional Rights of Unwed Fathers Before and After Lehr v. Robertson, 45 Ohio State L.J. 313, 368 (1984) (hereinafter Unwed Fathers).Â  The specific acts undertaken by the unwed father to preserve his inchoate relationship with his child, as well as the nature of the relationship he wishes to foster with the child, are of considerable importance in determining whether the unwed father has evinced a commitment to his child deserving of protection. See id. at 352; cf. Lehr, 463 U.S. at 262, 103 S.Ct. at 2994, 77 L.Ed.2d at 627 (appellant never had any significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship with child, and did not seek to establish a legal tie until after the child was two years old).Â  Moreover, the opportunity interest is of limited duration as a constitutionally significant interest because of the childâ€™s need for early permanence and stability in parental relationships.Â  Unwed Fathers at 365.\r\n Against this background, we must ascertain the interaction between the requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) and the unusual facts before us.Â  As always, our primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature. Spartanburg Cty. Depâ€™t of Social Svcs. v. Little, 309 S.C. 122, 420 S.E.2d 499 (1992). A statute must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.Â  Id.Â  We find that by enacting section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), the Legislature contemplated establishing general minimum standards by which an unwed father timely may demonstrate his commitment to the child, and his desire to â€œgrasp [the] opportunity,â€ Lehr, 463 U.S. at 262, 103 S.Ct. at 2993, 77 L.Ed.2d at 627, to assume full responsibility for his child.Â  However, as shown by the events leading to this appeal, an unwed fatherâ€™s ability to cultivate his opportunity interest in his child can be thwarted by the refusal of the mother to accept the fatherâ€™s expressions of interest in and commitment to the child.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that an unwed father is entitled to constitutional protection not only when he meets the literal requirements of section 20-7- 1690(A)(5)(b), but also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and to comply with the statute.Â  See In re Chandini, 166 A.D.2d 599, 560 N.Y.S.2d 886 (1990); In re Adoption of Baby Girl S., 141 Misc.2d 905, 535 N.Y.S.2d 676 (N.Y.Surr.1988); In re Baby Girl Eason, 257 Ga. 292, 358 S.E.2d 459 (1987); In re Riggs, 612 S.W.2d 461 (Tenn.Ct.App.1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 921, 101 S.Ct. 1370, 67 L.Ed.2d 349 (1981).Â  To mandate strict compliance with section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) would make an unwed fatherâ€™s right to withhold his consent to adoption dependent upon the whim of the unwed mother.Â  See In re Adoption of Baby Girl S., 141 Misc.2d 905, 535 N.Y.S.2d 676 (N.Y.Surr.1988).\r\n\r\n313 S.C. at 31-33, 437 S.E.2d at 28-29.\r\nThe court concluded Mitchellâ€™s efforts were sufficient to require his consent to the adoption.\r\n\r\nÂ It is undisputed that Mitchell attempted to provide monetary support to Julie during her pregnancy, but his offers were rejected by her.Â  In addition, Mitchell endeavored to keep apprised of Julieâ€™s progress during the pregnancy, but she shielded herself from contact with him, even to the point of complaining to her superiors that Mitchell was harassing her by his numerous telephone calls.Â  Mitchell appeared at the hospital after learning that the child had been born and offered to pay medical expenses related to the birth, but was told there were no expenses because he and Julie were in the Navy.Â  Although Mitchell sought no legal advice regarding the means available for him to protect his parental interest in the child, his lack of action was engendered by Julieâ€™s assurance to him that she would not place the child for adoption.Â  Further, Mitchell immediately manifested his willingness to assume sole custody of the child once he discovered that adoption proceedings had commenced.\r\n Time and circumstances may limit the protectibility of an unwed fatherâ€™s interest in his child.Â  The values that underlie protection require that the father take advantage of his opportunity to develop a relationship with his child early and completely.Â  Unwed Fathers at 364-67, 381-82.Â  Here, Mitchell timely demonstrated a willingness to develop a full custodial relationship with his child.Â  Accordingly, we find that the trial judge did not err in ruling that Mitchellâ€™s consent to the adoption was required, and that the adoption failed as the result of Mitchellâ€™s withholding of his consent.\r\n\r\n313 S.C. at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29.\r\nIn Ex parte Black, 330 S.C. 431, 499 S.E.2d 229 (Ct. App. 1998), Contius Black and Martha Jane Dubose were both high school students when they began a sexual relationship.Â  Black transferred to a nearby school and the two eventually ended their relationship.Â  Dubose discovered she was pregnant and attempted to contact Black.Â  She called his parentsâ€™ house and was told that he no longer lived there, although this information was apparently false.Â  Dubose gave birth on June 20, 1995, and gave the child over for adoption two days later.Â  \r\nBlack learned that Dubose might be pregnant in October or November of 1995.Â  In December 1995 he had a â€œchance meetingâ€ with Dubose and learned she had delivered the child, given her up for adoption, and that he was the biological father.Â  Black and his new wife contacted the adoption agency and Black was eventually added as a party to the adoption action.Â  The family court determined â€œBlackâ€™s consent for the adoption of the child was not necessary because of his â€˜failure to timely demonstrate a willingness to develop a custodial relationship with this child.â€™â€Â  330 S.C. at 433-34, 499 S.E.2d at 231.Â  We affirmed:\r\n\r\nWe find no merit to Blackâ€™s argument that the family court erred in finding he failed to timely demonstrate a willingness to develop a full custodial relationship with his daughter.\r\n If the biological father of a child was not married to the childâ€™s mother at the time the child was born and the child was placed with prospective adoptive parents six months or less after the childâ€™s birth, the fatherâ€™s consent or relinquishment for the purpose of adoption is necessary if the father paid a fair and reasonable sum, based on his financial ability, toward either the childâ€™s support or expenses incurred in connection with the motherâ€™s pregnancy or with the birth of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) (Supp. 1997).Â Â  An unwed father, however, is entitled to a relationship with his child not only when he meets the literal requirements of this section, â€œbut also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good-faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and to comply with the statute.â€Â  Abernathy v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 32, 437 S.E.2d 25, 29 (1993) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n Because section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) explicitly conditions the necessity of a fatherâ€™s acquiescence in an adoption on his payment of support or financial assistance to the birth mother, any steps Black may have taken to assert his parental rights are insufficient to protect his relationship with his child unless accompanied by a prompt, good-faith effort to assume responsibility for either a financial contribution to the childâ€™s welfare or assistance in paying for the birth motherâ€™s pregnancy or childbirth expenses.Â  Here, the record contains no evidence that Black attempted at any time to help Dubose or Bethany Christian Services with pregnancy or childbirth expenses.Â  Moreover, even assuming Black is correct that he took prompt measures to determine paternity and assert his parental rights after Dubose told him about the child, he admitted he never offered to support the child, even after receiving the results of the paternity test, which were available about five months before the final hearing.Â  Although the family court relied primarily on Blackâ€™s lack of diligence in making inquiries about Duboseâ€™s pregnancy, the record evidence of his failure to offer support for the child as of the date of the final hearing warrants our affirmance of the family court order.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\nBlack, 330 S.C. at 434-35, 499 S.E.2d at 231-32 (footnote omitted).\r\nTeenagers Christine Lovin and Samuel Dunlap were involved in a sexual relationship in Parag v. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, 508 S.E.2d 590 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Dunlap bought her a pregnancy test when she informed him she might be pregnant, but Lovin did not give him the results.Â  The two terminated their relationship in December 1994 or January 1995.Â  Dunlap continued to inquire whether Lovin was pregnant, but Lovin would neither admit nor deny the pregnancy.Â  She gave birth on July 8, 1995, and gave the baby up for adoption.Â  Lovin did not tell Dunlap about the birth until October 1995.Â  The Parags, in connection with their action to adopt Baby Boy Lovin, hired investigator Oehler to locate the childâ€™s father.Â  Oehler contacted Dunlap in January of 1996.Â  Initially, Dunlap indicated â€œhe was planning to attend college on a football scholarship and the birth of the child interfered with his life.Â  He stated he was not interested in having the child, but was interested in releasing the child for adoption[.]â€Â  333 S.C. at 224, 508 S.E.2d at 592.Â  A few days later, he changed his mind; â€œafter talking with his grandmother and father, he thought he wanted to have the child for them to rear.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Parags commenced an action seeking adoption and the termination of Dunlapâ€™s parental rights.Â  The family court concluded Dunlap had shown sufficient good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and was entitled to protection under section 20-7-1690 and Abernathy.Â  Adoption was accordingly denied.Â  We disagreed and reversed, noting both the pre- and post-birth shortfalls of Dunlap.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent . . . upon the unwed father to demonstrate a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by coming forward to participate in the rearing of the child before he may acquire substantial constitutional protection, and the mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection.Â  While the unwed father possesses an opportunity to develop a relationship with his offspring, this opportunity is of limited duration as a constitutionally significant interest because of the childâ€™s need for early permanence and stability in parental relationships.Â  As stated by the court in Abernathy, â€œTime and circumstances may limit the protectibility of an unwed fatherâ€™s interest in his child.Â  The values that underlie protection require that the father take advantage of his opportunity to develop a relationship with his child early and completely.â€Â  313 S.C. at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29 (emphasis added). Thus, the unwed father must timely â€œdemonstrate his commitment to the child, and his desire to grasp the opportunity.â€Â  313 S.C. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29.\r\nTurning to the facts at hand, we find Dunlap has failed to demonstrate sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and comply with the statute.Â  Dunlap was aware that Lovin might be pregnant in November of 1994.Â  While Dunlap claims he was thwarted in his efforts to assist Lovin with the pregnancy by her avoidance of him, the record clearly shows that in October 1995, Lovin informed Dunlap of the pregnancy and the birth of his child.Â  He was further aware at that time that the child was placed for adoption and he correctly assumed the child was in the area where Lovin had given birth.Â  From October of 1995, Dunlap had information with which he could have sought the exact location of his child and made efforts to cultivate a relationship with the child and assume parental responsibility.Â  However, he failed to take any action until he was contacted by the adoption investigator, three months later.Â  Even then, the record evinces the extent of his efforts to be only submission to paternity testing and participation in the adoption action.Â  There is absolutely no evidence that Dunlap was thwarted in any way from demonstrating his commitment to the child once he learned of the childâ€™s birth.Â  It is uncontested Dunlap never offered any financial support or assistance to Lovin in connection with the expenses of the pregnancy and birth after learning of the childâ€™s birth.Â  Further, the record shows Dunlap never offered any financial support for the child after learning of the childâ€™s birth. See Ex parte Black, 330 S.C. 431, 499 S.E.2d 229 (Ct. App. 1998) (assuming unwed father took prompt measures to determine paternity and assert parental rights after biological mother informed father of childâ€™s existence, where father failed to offer to support child or assist in medical expenses, his consent to adoption was not required under Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b)).Â  We therefore conclude Dunlap has failed to timely demonstrate his commitment to the child and has failed to show sufficient efforts to assume parental responsibility and comply with the statute as required under Abernathy.Â  Accordingly, Dunlapâ€™s consent was not required under Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), and the order below denying the adoption on this basis is reversed.\r\n\r\nParag, 333 S.C. at 227-29, 508 S.E.2d at 593-94 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn Doe v. Brown, 331 S.C. 491, 489 S.E.2d 917 (1997), Baby Girl Ashlie was conceived as the result of Brownâ€™s statutory rape of the twelve-year-old mother.Â  The mother relinquished her parental rights and consented to adoption.Â  Brown, joined by his parents, intervened and opposed the adoption.Â  The family court terminated Brownâ€™s parental rights, and that ruling was affirmed by the supreme court. \r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast to Abernathy, the family court judge in this case found Father â€œyoung, immature, and irresponsible.â€Â Â  He found Father failed to meet the statutory requirements, and that his conduct upon learning of the pregnancy and during the next several months did not rise to the level necessary to meet the Abernathy standard.Â  Although this Court is free to find the facts differently from the family court, we find the record overwhelmingly supports these findings.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 440 S.E.2d 884 (1994).Â  \r\n\r\nBrown, 331 S.C. at 497-98, 489 S.E.2d at 921. \r\nThe supreme court, in Doe v. Queen, 347 S.C. 4, 552 S.E.2d 761 (2001), held that the unwed fatherâ€™s efforts to assume parental responsibility were sufficient to require his consent to adoption.Â  The biological mother informed Queen that she was pregnant and wanted an abortion.Â  Queen attempted to convince the mother to keep the child.Â  The two ended their relationship, and the mother informed Queen she had aborted the child.Â  The mother and her new boyfriend signed a criminal warrant against Queen for assault with a deadly weapon, and as a condition of his bond, Queen was ordered to have no contact with the mother for one year.Â  The child was born on September 21, 1998.Â  When Queen was notified of the birth in November 1998 he obtained an attorney.Â  He began saving money, prepared a nursery, and arranged for medical insurance for the child.Â  The family court ordered that Queenâ€™s consent to adoption was required under section 20-7-1690 and Abernathy.Â  The supreme court agreed with the family court:\r\n\r\nInitially, we find Queen should not be penalized for his actions, or lack thereof, prior to Tannerâ€™s birth.Â  Mother left their apartment when she was approximately 8-10 weeks pregnant, telling Queen she intended to have an abortion.Â  She thereafter lied, telling him she had, in fact, had an abortion in Atlanta.Â  She then made every attempt to conceal from Queen the fact that she had not had an abortion, effectively isolating herself from him and, through court orders, ensuring that Queen could have no contact with her until well after the babyâ€™s birth. \r\n As we noted in Abernathy, â€œan unwed fatherâ€™s ability to cultivate his opportunity interest in his child can be thwarted by the refusal of the mother to accept the fatherâ€™s expressions of interest in and commitment to the child. . . . To mandate strict compliance with section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) would make an unwed fatherâ€™s right to withhold his consent to adoption dependent upon the whim of the unwed mother.â€Â  313 S.C. at 32-33, 437 S.E.2d at 29.Â  This is clearly such a case.Â  Given Motherâ€™s representations that she had obtained an abortion, coupled with her extraordinary efforts to conceal her pregnancy from Queen, we find the preponderance of the evidence amply demonstrates that Queenâ€™s failure to support during the pregnancy was through no fault of his own and, accordingly, we decline to require literal compliance with the statute.\r\n Moreover, we find Queenâ€™s actions subsequent to learning of Tannerâ€™s birth demonstrate â€œsufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility.â€\r\nThe family court found Queen had made sufficient efforts in that he had â€œestablished a nursery, arranged for health insurance and began a savings account for the child.â€Â  We agree.Â  While Queen conceded he had not paid support during the ten-month period prior to the hearing, he testified he was willing to do so, and would reimburse the adoptive parents for their expenses.Â  Further, due to a February 1999 order preventing the disclosure of the identity of the adoptive parents, Queen was unaware of the name or identity of the Does, and/or their location.Â  Under these circumstances, we simply cannot say that Queenâ€™s failure to support or visit Tanner defeats his constitutional interest in establishing a relationship with his son. \r\n  When approached by the Doeâ€™s attorney, at which time Queen learned of Tannerâ€™s existence, Queen declined to sign a consent to adoption, instead indicating he needed to contact his attorney.Â  For reasons unknown to this Court, his attorney sought and obtained an unlimited extension in which to file responsive pleadings such that an answer to the Doeâ€™s complaint was not filed until the day of the hearing.Â  Although Queen testified he was willing and able to support the child, and had money in savings for Tanner, his mother testified that Queenâ€™s attorney never advised him to send any money to the Does. \r\n  Given the circumstances of this case, and the fact that the Does were unwilling to reveal their identity or whereabouts, we find Queen took the only reasonably available alternative measures, to wit, establishing a nursery, putting money in a bank account, and taking steps to provide for Tanner when he received custody.Â  In our view, under the very limited facts of this case, we find Queen demonstrated sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility pursuant to Abernathy such that his literal compliance with section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) is excused.Â  Accordingly, we concur with the family court that the adoption was properly denied and custody of Tanner should be transferred to Queen.\r\n\r\nQueen, 347 S.C. at 8-10, 552 S.E.2d at 763-64 (footnote omitted).\r\nArscott v. Bacon, 351 S.C. 44, 567 S.E.2d 898 (Ct. App. 2002), is our most recent decision regarding consent for adoption by an unwed father.Â  Edgar Bacon and Mary Ford began a sexual relationship in May 1999.Â  Ford discovered she was pregnant in October 1999.Â  Approximately two weeks later, she told Bacon she had had an abortion.Â  In November, Bacon ended the relationship.Â  Mary Ford was arrested for robbing Baconâ€™s home and was incarcerated.Â  Unconvinced that she had been pregnant or had gone through with an abortion, Bacon inquired at the local jail whether Ford was pregnant, and jail authorities indicated that she claimed to be pregnant.Â  Upon her release, Ford stayed at a womenâ€™s shelter.Â  Bacon drove by the shelter many times in an effort to catch a glimpse of her.Â  Ford delivered the child in May 2000 and gave it up for adoption.Â  On July 17, 2000, Ford appeared in criminal court on the burglary charge and informed Bacon that she had given birth, although Bacon still was not convinced she had ever been pregnant.Â  Finally, Bacon was served with notice of the adoption action in August.Â  He opposed the adoption, claiming Ford had concealed the pregnancy.\r\nAfter analyzing Abernathy, Queen, Parag, and Black, we concluded Bacon had not satisfied the requirements of the statute and precedent.\r\n\r\n This is not a â€œthwarted birth fatherâ€ case.Â  In his answer, Bacon alleged Ford concealed the pregnancy from him and the first notice he had of the parental relationship was service of the complaint.Â  The facts indicate otherwise.Â  Ford told Bacon in October 1999 that she was pregnant.Â  Although she told him she was going to have an abortion, Bacon stated he did not believe her, and she never produced the written proof which Bacon requested.Â  Bacon asked authorities if Ford was pregnant and was advised she had completed a jail form indicating she was.Â  Bacon continually asked people if Ford appeared pregnant.Â  He drove past a local health care facility to see if he could observe her entering or leaving.Â  He knew Ford was living in the community and staying at a local womenâ€™s shelter.Â  Although she could not contact him due to the conditions of her criminal bond, Bacon was not legally prohibited from contacting her or having someone else contact her.Â  Most importantly, from July 17 to August 16, Bacon did nothing, despite knowing that Ford had a child and he could be the father.\r\n The critical question is not whether Bacon believed Ford was pregnant but whether he was on notice of sufficient facts to pursue his legal rights and whether he was thwarted by the birth mother from doing so.Â  Generally, courts rely on parties to be proactive in protecting their own rights.Â  Bacon was on notice of sufficient facts to create an affirmative duty to investigate whether Ford was carrying or had delivered his child if he wished to claim constitutional protection.Â  Under the provisions of the statute relating to unmarried fathers, paternity may frequently be in doubt.Â  However, doubt as to paternity does not totally absolve a putative father of his responsibility to take steps to protect his rights.Â  Most cases focus on pre-placement conduct except where there is no evidence the natural father knew of the birth.Â  In light of the information Bacon had, and particularly given his personal distrust of Fordâ€™s credibility, his lack of initiative calls into question his concern about protecting his rights as a father.Â  His actions fall short of the sufficient prompt and good faith efforts necessary for constitutional protection to attach.Â  Thus, we conclude Baconâ€™s consent to the adoption was not necessary.\r\nMoreover, in the ultimate analysis, this courtâ€™s lodestar is always the best interests of the child.Â  See, e.g. Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d 386, 388 (2001) (â€œIn a custody case, the best interest of the child is the controlling factor.â€); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 298, 547 S.E.2d 506, 511 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe best interests of the child are paramount when adjudicating a TPR case.â€).Â Â  Our supreme court recently overruled a long line of cases holding that the termination of parental rights statute should be strictly construed and determined that it should be liberally construed consistent with the purpose of facilitating prompt adoption and the best interests of the child.Â  See Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000).Â  Likewise, we consider the childâ€™s best interests as a factor here.Â  In Abernathy, the supreme court stated that the fatherâ€™s constitutional window is a limited one, balanced against the childâ€™s interest in stability.Â  Abernathy at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 28.Â  The record is clear that both the natural father and the adoptive parents would be fit parents and provide loving homes.Â  However, the evaluating psychologistâ€™s testimony is also clear that taking the child out of the home he has known from birth until two years old would result in significant long-term trauma and possibly severe attachment issues.Â  Thus, the best interests of Infant Baby Boy warrant reversal of the family court in this instance.\r\nDue to its finding that Baconâ€™s consent was required, the family court held the adoption by the Arscotts could not proceed.Â  Given that Ford gave her consent to the adoption specifically to the Arscotts, the family court held that Ford could possibly initiate an action seeking to withdraw her consent for adoption.Â  The court therefore declined to terminate her parental rights.Â  No specific issue was raised by the appellants to the courtâ€™s ruling regarding Ford.Â  However, due to the role of the courts in protecting minors, this court may raise ex mero motu issues not raised by the parties.Â  See Joiner at 107, 536 S.E.2d at 374.Â  As in Parag, because Ford consented to the adoption and defaulted below, the family court erred in not terminating her parental rights.Â  Parag at 229, 508 S.E.2d at 594.Â  The record discloses no indication that Fordâ€™s consent to adoption of the child by the Arscotts was involuntary.Â  Since we conclude Baconâ€™s consent is not required, there is no reason to vitiate Fordâ€™s consent.Â  Rather, it is in the best interests of the minor child to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible.Â  Therefore, we reverse the family courtâ€™s decision not to terminate Fordâ€™s parental rights.Â  Fordâ€™s parental rights are terminated, and the adoption may proceed without Baconâ€™s consent.\r\n\r\nArscott, 351 S.C. at 54-56, 567 S.E.2d at 903-04.Â  \r\nC.Â  Roeâ€™s Conduct\r\nInitially, it is important to note that section 20-7-1690 is the benchmark for determining whether an unwed fatherâ€™s consent is required before an adoption takes place.Â  This statutory starting point requires that a father pay a â€œfair and reasonable sum, based on the fatherâ€™s financial ability, for the support of the child or for the expenses incurred in connection with the motherâ€™s pregnancy or with the birth of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, hospital, and nursing expenses.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690 (Supp. 2005).Â  Abernathy held that under certain circumstances, total compliance with the literal requirement of the statute might be excused.Â  In Abernathy, the court declared:\r\n\r\nan unwed fatherâ€™s ability to cultivate his opportunity interest in his child can be thwarted by the refusal of the mother to accept the fatherâ€™s expressions of interest in and commitment to the child.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that an unwed father is entitled to constitutional protection not only when he meets the literal requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), but also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and to comply with the statute.\r\n\r\nAbernathy, 313 S.C. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29 (emphasis added).Â  Thus, Abernathyâ€™s sufficient prompt and good faith efforts test does not replace the statute, but rather extends the spirit of the statute to an unwed father who is prevented from meeting the statutory requirements, especially when impeded from compliance by the birth mother.Â  \r\nThe instant case is readily distinguishable from Abernathy and Queenâ€”the two cases in which our supreme court has found a fatherâ€™s consent to adoption necessary.Â  Consent cases involve a fact-intensive analysis, and the decisions in both Abernathy and Queen were predicated upon unusual facts.Â  Arscott, 351 S.C. at 48, 567 S.E.2d at 900 (â€œThe importance of analyzing the facts of each specific case cannot be overstated.â€); Abernathy, 313 S.C. at 31, 437 S.E.2d at 29 (â€œ[W]e must ascertain the interaction between the requirements of section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b) and the unusual facts before us.â€); Queen, 347 S.C. at 10, 552 S.E.2d at 764 (â€œIn our view, under the very limited facts of this case, we find Queen demonstrated sufficient prompt and good faith efforts[.]â€).\r\nThe father in Abernathy was faced with military deployment which forced his separation from the mother.Â  He nevertheless sought to provide during the pregnancy by giving the mother full use of his car and bank account.Â  Once the father returned, the mother â€œrebuffed his advances and rejected his offer of marriage.â€Â  Contrastively, Roeâ€™s contributions to Melanie were too insubstantial to be of consequence.Â  During the last half of Melanieâ€™s pregnancy Roe saw her for only fifteen minutes and contributed nothing to her except a pillow.Â  Melanie never rebuffed his advances or otherwise demonstrated a disinterest in having Roe involved and supportive during the pregnancy.Â  Whereas the father in Abernathy â€œtimely demonstrated a willingness to develop a full custodial relationship with his child,â€ 313 S.C. at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29, Roe failed to evince a commitment to the child deserving of protection, see id. at 31, 437 S.E.2d at 28 (â€œThe specific acts undertaken by the unwed father to preserve his inchoate relationship with his child, as well as the nature of the relationship he wishes to foster with the child, are of considerable importance in determining whether the unwed father has evinced a commitment to his child deserving of protection.â€).Â  \r\n Queen was a thwarted birth father case.Â  The mother misled the father into believing she had had an abortion and obtained a warrant whereby Queen was ordered to have no contact with her.Â  After learning about the baby, Queen put away money for the child, arranged for the childâ€™s medical insurance, and prepared a nursery.Â  Here, Roe maintained contact with Melanie for only the first half of her pregnancy.Â  It was Roeâ€”not Melanieâ€”who ended the contact.Â  Melanie never refused Roeâ€™s help, but rather requested it, informing him, â€œI canâ€™t do it by myself.â€Â  Further, Melanie attempted to reach Roe on several occasions, but he was apparently avoiding her in a surreptitious attempt to mislead her into believing he was divorcing his wife.Â  His contributions to her were de minimis.Â  In Queen, the court noted that â€œQueenâ€™s failure to support during the pregnancy was through no fault of his own[.]â€Â  In contrast, the blame for Roeâ€™s failure to support Melanie during her pregnancy falls squarely on his shoulders.Â  \r\nPrior to August 4, Roeâ€™s contributions to Melanie were negligible, consisting of approximately $50, cigarettes, and a few trips to fast food restaurants.Â  After August 4 he gave her nothing but a card and a pillow.Â  Roeâ€™s contributions to Melanie were insubstantial and inconsistent.Â  As the Arscott court observed, â€œMost cases focus on pre-placement conduct except where there is no evidence the natural father knew of the birth.â€Â  351 S.C. at 54, 567 S.E.2d at 903.Â  Roe simply failed to meet the â€œgeneral minimum standards by which an unwed father timely may demonstrate his commitment to the child, and his desire to grasp the opportunity to assume full responsibility for his child.â€ Â Abernathy 313 S.C. at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nII.Â  Best-Interests Analysis\r\nRoe contends the judge erred by going beyond the scope of the hearing and engaging in a best-interests analysis.Â  The parties stipulated prior to trial that the Does were seeking only adoption and did not have an alternative pleading for custody.Â  Therefore, had Roeâ€™s consent been required, Roe would have been granted custody.Â  Given the stipulation, Roe contends the court should not have addressed the childâ€™s best interests. We disagree.Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s decision was based on Roeâ€™s failure to comply with the statute and case law, independent of considerations of the childâ€™s best interests.Â  The family courtâ€™s order stated: â€œIt is clear, and this Court holds, that Mr. Roe failed both the literal language of the statute and failed to exercise his responsibilities pursuant to the Common Law Precedent.â€Â  The courtâ€™s legal conclusion stands on its own.Â  Although the best-interests finding was not required, the court did not err in separately considering the childâ€™s best interests.Â  As we stated in Arscott, â€œ[I]n the ultimate analysis, this courtâ€™s lodestar is always the best interests of the child.â€Â  Arscott, 351 S.C. at 55, 567 S.E.2d at 903.Â  Therefore, the courtâ€™s best-interests analysis does not constitute reversible error.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Termination of Roeâ€™s Parental Rights\r\nRoe argues that even if section 20-7-1690 and Abernathy did not require his consent to the adoption, his parental rights should not have been terminated.Â  He maintains that because his parental rights should not have been terminated, the notice provision of section 20-7-1374 allows him to â€œfully participate in the adoption proceedings and assert his independent causes of action for custody.â€Â  \r\nA.Â  Preservation\r\nThis argument was not raised in Roeâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion, and does not appear to be preserved.Â  An issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 598 S.E.2d 712 (2004); Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000); Austin v. Specialty Transp. Services, Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 594 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 594 S.E.2d 485 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting it is axiomatic than an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).Â  An issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 597 S.E.2d 897 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nRoe filed a Rule 59(e) motion raising several issues, but the motion did not mention the courtâ€™s termination of his parental rights.Â  Moreover, at the Rule 59(e) hearing, Roeâ€™s counsel acknowledged the courtâ€™s termination of his parental rights in passing and did not assert that the termination was in error.Â  In asking the court to grant Roe supervised visitation counsel stated: â€œI know this is getting into a whole new issue here and the court certainly has ruled that his rights are to be terminated under this order.Â  But I would ask the court and in reviewing this to address that issue as to whether or not Mr. Roe should be afforded any visitation.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  Roe never complained to the family court of the termination of his parental rights.Â  Because Roe did not raise this issue in his Rule 59(e) motion, he may not raise it for the first time on appeal.\r\nB.Â  Merits of the TerminationÂ  \r\nEven were this issue preserved, the family court properly denied Roeâ€™s parental rights.Â  The United States Supreme Court case, Lehr v. Robinson, 463 U.S. 248 (1983), elucidated that a biological father has a limited window in which to secure for himself Constitutional protection of the father-child relationship:\r\n\r\nWhen an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by â€œcom[ing] forward to participate in the rearing of his child,â€ Caban, 441 U.S., at 392, 99 S.Ct., at 1768, his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the due process clause.Â  At that point it may be said that he â€œact[s] as a father toward his children.â€ Id., at 389, n. 7, 99 S.Ct., at 1766, n. 7.Â  But the mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection. . . .\r\nThe significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring.Â  If he grasps that opportunity and accepts some measure of responsibility for the childâ€™s future, he may enjoy the blessings of the parent-child relationship and make uniquely valuable contributions to the childâ€™s development. Â If he fails to do so, the Federal Constitution will not automatically compel a state to listen to his opinion of where the childâ€™s best interests lie.\r\n\r\nLehr, 463 U.S. at 261-62 (footnotes omitted).\r\nIn the case sub judice, the family court extended Roe his procedural and substantive due process rights and determined he had failed to demonstrate the level of commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood that would trigger constitutional protection.Â  Roe correctly asserts that, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. section 20-7-1770 (Supp. 2005), biological parents lose their rights over the adoptee after a final decree of adoption is entered.Â  However, nothing in the statute prevents this process from being completed in a bifurcated fashion as the court did here.Â  \r\nThe family court adjudicated Roeâ€™s claim that his consent was required for adoption.Â  By requesting remand to determine whether adoption by the Does would be in Jayâ€™s best interest, Roe is essentially seeking an impermissible second attempt at preventing the adoption.Â  The family court did not err in terminating Roeâ€™s parental rights.Â  Further, because his rights were properly terminated, Roe is not entitled to notice of the final adoption proceeding pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. section 20-7-1734(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  See id. (â€œNotice of any proceeding initiated pursuant to this Subarticle 7 of Article 11 of Chapter 7 of Title 20 must be given to the persons or agencies specified in subsection (B) of this section, unless the person has given consent or relinquishment or parental rights have been terminated.â€) (emphasis added). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the family court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4120","title":"Hancock v.

Price, Jr., of Newberry, for Appellant.\r\nElizabeth M. Damzell, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Betty Jo Hancock brought this negligence action against Mid-South Management Co., Inc. for injuries she received while walking across a parking lot owned by Mid-South.Â  Hancock appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Mid-South.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 5, 2001, Hancock and her daughter-in-law, Susan Hancock (Daughter), drove to the offices of The Newberry Observer, a local news agency, to pick up a newspaper.Â  After Daughter parked in the Observerâ€™s parking lot, Hancock walked toward the Observerâ€™s office building and tripped.Â  As a result of her fall, Hancock allegedly suffered physical, emotional, and financial injuries.Â  In April 2004, Hancock brought suit against Mid-South, the owner of the Observer, alleging Mid-South was negligent in maintaining the parking lot of the Observer.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n Mid-South filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which was heard on May 5, 2005.Â  At the hearing, the parties submitted deposition testimony from Hancock and Daughter, and photographs of the parking lot in support of their respective positions.Â  Hancockâ€™s deposition testimony provides she tripped on something that was raised.Â  Hancock testified she tripped on something that â€œfelt like a rock or something to that affect,â€ and that â€œ[i]t was the broken asphalt that I tripped on.â€Â  However, Hancock also testified she could not remember exactly where she fell.Â  \r\nDaughter, using a photograph of the Observerâ€™s parking lot, testified Hancock fell â€œ[r]ight there where things changedâ€ from asphalt to cement.Â  The photographs presented show the Observerâ€™s parking lot and an abutting cement walkway.Â  The photographs show a change in elevation at the point the asphalt meets the walkway.Â  The photographs also show that, several feet away from the walkway, portions of the Observerâ€™s parking lot are littered with rocks or broken asphalt and cracks.Â  \r\nAlso in evidence was an affidavit of Ernestine B. LeCoate, a former employee of the Newberry Publishing Company, the publisher of the Observer.Â  LeCoateâ€™s affidavit provides â€œit was a well known fact to all employees, including deponent, that the parking lot was in a deteriorated condition with potholes . . .â€ and management was aware of the parking lotâ€™s condition.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Mid-South argued summary judgment was required because the only evidence presented establishes Hancock tripped on a change in elevation, where the pavement changes into cement.Â  Hancock argued the evidence indicates Hancockâ€™s injuries were caused by broken asphalt.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted Mid-Southâ€™s summary judgment motion.Â  Hancock filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment is proper when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Id.Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, â€œthe evidence and inferences that can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€\r\nTremont Constr. Co., Inc. v. Dunlap, 310 S.C. 180, 181, 425 S.E.2d 792, 793 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œIf more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the jury. However, if the evidence is susceptible of only one reasonable inference, the question is no longer one for the jury but one of law for the Court.â€Â \r\nWard v. Zelinski, 260 S.C. 229, 232, 195 S.E.2d 385, 387 (1973).Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHancock contends the trial court erred in granting Mid-Southâ€™s summary judgment motion because the evidence presented demonstrates Mid-South should be liable for Hancockâ€™s injuries.Â  Specifically, Hancock argues the trial court erred in finding the Observerâ€™s parking lot did not constitute a defective or dangerous condition and Hancockâ€™s fall was not caused by an elevation change.Â  We disagree.[1]  \r\nâ€œA merchant is not an insurer of the safety of his customers but rather owes them the duty to exercise ordinary care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition.â€Â  Denton v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 312 S.C. 119, 120, 439 S.E.2d 292, 293 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€˜â€œThe landowner has a duty to warn an invitee only of latent or hidden dangers of which the landowner has knowledge or should have knowledge.â€â€™Â  Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 445, 531 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C. 123, 406 S.E.2d 361 (1991)).Â  â€œTo recover damages for injuries caused by a dangerous or defective condition on a storekeeperâ€™s premises, the plaintiff must show either (1) that the injury was caused by a specific act of the defendant which created the dangerous condition; or (2) that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and failed to remedy it.â€Â  Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 35, 542 S.E.2d 728, 729 (2001).\r\nâ€œThe mere fact that there is a difference between the levels in the different parts of the premises does not, in itself, indicate negligence unless, owing to the character, location and surrounding condition of the change of level, a reasonably careful person would not be likely to expect or see it.â€Â  Bruno v. Pendleton Realty Co., 240 S.C. 46, 51, 124 S.E.2d 580, 582 (1962).Â  Similarly, â€˜â€œ[a] step-up or step-down in a parking lot does not, in and of itself, constitute negligence.â€â€™Â  Denton, 312 S.C. at 121, 439 S.E.2d at 294 (quoting Bruno v. Pendleton Realty Co., 240 S.C. 46, 51, 124 S.E.2d 580, 582 (1962)).Â  \r\nIn Denton, this court analyzed whether a grocery store was negligent in failing to warn a customer about a cart corral in the storeâ€™s parking lot.Â  In finding the trial court should have entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the grocery store, the court held: \r\n\r\nThe corral was not materially different from speed bumps, curbing, or concrete\r\ndividers at the head of parking spaces--all of which are commonly found in or along public streets and places to park. Accidents may happen around these structures as they do on steps, escalators, and other raised structures. This does not mean they are unreasonably dangerous or that a person exercising due care would not have them on the premises. They are, in fact, common structures that a person taking reasonable care for his own safety would likely expect and see while on the premises.\r\n\r\n312 S.C. at 121, 439 S.E.2d at 294.Â  Thus, the key question in cases involving the determination of whether a raise in elevation in or around a parking lot may be considered a dangerous or defective condition is whether the change in elevation is something â€œa person taking reasonable care for [his or her] own safety would likely expect and see while on the premises.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, the only testimony presented indicates Hancock fell at the point where the pavement and the cement meet.Â  Daughter testified to that effect, and Hancock could not recall the location of her fall.Â  The photographs of the Observerâ€™s parking lot clearly show a change in elevation at the point the pavement and cement meet.Â  In addition, the record provides the change in elevation was clearly visible at the time of Hancockâ€™s fall; Hancockâ€™s deposition testimony provides no debris obstructed her view of the change in elevation.Â  Based on the facts of this case, we find a person taking reasonable care should anticipate a possible change in elevation where asphalt meets an adjacent walkway.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in finding Hancock failed to demonstrate a dangerous or defective condition caused her fall because the evidence demonstrates Hancock fell on a clear change in elevation that a person taking reasonable care would expect to see.Â  \r\nMoreover, even if the change in elevation amounts to a dangerous or defective condition, Hancock still failed to prove Mid-South could be liable because the elevation change is an open and obvious condition.Â  â€œA landowner generally does not owe a duty to warn others of open and obvious conditions on the property.â€Â  Larimore, 340 S.C. at 445, 531 S.E.2d at 539.Â  However, a landowner may still be liable for injuries suffered from an open and obvious defect if the landowner should have anticipated the harm.Â  Callander v. Charleston Doughnut Corp., 305 S.C. 123, 125-26, 406 S.E.2d 361, 362-63 (1991).Â  A landowner may expect harm to the visitor from known or obvious dangers when the owner has reason to expect the inviteeâ€™s attention may be distracted.Â  See Larimore, 340 S.C. at 446 n.15, 531 S.E.2d at 539 n.15 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 343A (1965)).Â  We find the elevation where the asphalt meets the walkway is an open and obvious condition, and therefore, Mid-South had no duty to warn visitors of the elevation.Â  We also find Mid-South had no reason to anticipate harm to Hancock in this case because the record provides Hancock was not distracted at the time of her fall.Â  \r\nBased on the above, we find the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Mid-South.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. [2]\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We note Hancock separately addresses these issues in her brief; however, because we find the issues interrelated, we discuss them accordingly.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4121","title":"State v.

Hodge, Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: A Marlboro County jury convicted Dana Lockamy of murder in the death of his brother, James E. Lockamy, and the trial court sentenced him to thirty years in prison.Â  On appeal, Lockamy argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the law of self-defense given the events surrounding the shooting.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Lockamys own a thirty-acre parcel of land in Marlboro County.Â  Both Dana and his brother, James, lived on this property.Â  Dana resided in a home with his father, Andrew Lockamy, and James lived in another home located approximately a quarter of a mile away.Â  Andrew Lockamy owns and operates a trucking business that utilizes tractor-trailer trucks to haul commodities from state to state.Â  The brothers both worked for their father driving the trucks.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn May 25, 2002, Dana and his father returned home after hauling a load of produce to Florida.Â  Shortly after their arrival, James called and asked Dana if he could borrow a set of hand tools to work on a lawnmower.Â Â Â  Dana said that he could and drove the short distance to his brotherâ€™s house with the tool set.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWhen Dana arrived at his brotherâ€™s house he found James standing outside near a workbench working on the lawnmower.Â  James walked over to the truck and Dana handed him the tool set through the passenger side window.Â  As the tool set was handed over, Dana asked that James be careful and not lose any of the tools.Â  At this point, according to Dana, James became enraged, began cursing at him, and threatened to â€œbeat [his] brains out and leave [him] lying in a pool of blood.â€Â  \r\nAfter throwing the tool set back into the truck, James strode around to the driverâ€™s side window and began beating Dana in the head with a stick.Â  Dana grabbed the stick and threw it out of the passenger window, after which James continued to hit Dana with his fists.Â  In an attempt to stop the beating, Dana began to drive off, but James grabbed Danaâ€™s arm and continued to strike him.Â  Unable to drive away, Dana stopped the truck and attempted to get out of the vehicle.Â  As he attempted to exit, James slammed the car door on him pinning Dana between the door and the body of the truck.Â  \r\nHaving freed himself from the car door, Dana leaned against the bed of the truck to recover.Â  James then walked a short distance away and retrieved a large iron pipe which he used to beat Dana in the arms, hips, and ribs.Â  Dana testified that when he retrieved the pipe, James was holding it â€œmarching back and forth like a Roman soldierâ€ and shouting â€œIâ€™ve got the power, Iâ€™ve got the power.â€[2]Â  After sustaining several blows with the pipe, Dana, being the larger of the two brothers, was able to wrest the pipe away from James.Â  Having been disarmed, James again began striking Dana in the head and body with his fists.Â  According to Dana, the repeated assaults lasted approximately ten minutes.Â  \r\nWhen the attack subsided, Dana testified that James walked a short distance away and began laughing and joking about the beating he gave Dana.Â  James also stated that next time he would finish beating Danaâ€™s brains out and then go to their fatherâ€™s home and do the same to him.Â  Dana got back in the truck and drove out of Jamesâ€™ yard and down the street when he noticed in the rear-view mirror that his face was covered in blood.Â  He also noticed his sunglasses were missing and that his glass eye was not in place.Â  At that point, Dana assumed the glass eye was knocked out during the altercation, but it was learned after the incident that he took the glass eye out before he drove to Jamesâ€™ house.Â  \r\nHaving noticed his injuries, Dana drove the short distance to the house he shared with his father and retrieved a shotgun.Â  Dana testified that he thought mistakenly â€œsurely . . . he would not attack me if I had a weapon when I returned.â€Â  Dana stated that he wanted to return to his brotherâ€™s house to retrieve his glass eye, which, as noted previously, he mistakenly thought was knocked out by the assault.\r\nWhen Dana arrived back at Jamesâ€™ he left the gun in the truck, got out, and noticed one of Jamesâ€™ friends handing him a packet of drugs.Â  James started to brag about beating Dana with his fists and then asked Dana if he could still borrow the tool set.Â  Dana responded that he could not borrow the tools and this again enraged James.Â  Having been denied the use of his brotherâ€™s tools, James picked up a socket wrench and approached Dana with it raised above his head, poised to strike.Â  As he approached, he threatened to knock Danaâ€™s good eye out of his head.Â  \r\nDana backed up towards the truck, reached through the window and retrieved the gun.Â  Dana stated that his intention was to fire a shot into the ground.Â  Meanwhile James continued to threaten Dana and his father.Â  Even after seeing the gun, James advanced towards Dana and attempted to strike him with the ratchet.Â  Dana got down on his knees and attempted to cover his head with one of his arms while James was standing above him with the gun sticking out between Jamesâ€™ legs.Â  \r\nWhen James went to strike Dana with the wrench, Dana was able to locate and disengage the safety on the gun and pump a shell into the chamber.Â  At this point, James dropped the wrench and started to run away.Â  Dana then stood up and walked a short distance holding the gun down by his side.Â  As James ran away, Dana said â€œdonâ€™t ever beat me in my head and face like that again, and donâ€™t ever come to our fatherâ€™s home and harm him in any way or there will be no warning shot fired the next time.â€Â  \r\nJames ran around a large tree and across a small garden[3] before Dana, still holding the gun at his side, fired one shot through the tree in the direction James was running.Â  Dana testified that at the time he fired the shot, he could not see James.Â  After approximately one minute, James walked back into view towards Dana.Â  Dana stated that he noticed a small amount of blood on Jamesâ€™ arm, but otherwise did not think James was seriously injured.Â  Dana got back in his truck, drove home to his fatherâ€™s house, and began to wash blood off his face.Â  In fact, he was so occupied when the police arrived to arrest him a short time later.\r\nWhen paramedics arrived at the scene of the shooting, they found James deceased, lying in a field beside his home.Â  The coroner determined he died from a single gunshot wound to the back.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Dana argues that given the particular facts surrounding the incident, the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the law of self-defense.\r\nâ€œâ€˜An appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused its discretion.â€™â€Â  State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000)).Â  Furthermore, â€œthe trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury instruction must be both erroneous and prejudicial to warrant reversal.â€Â  State v. Light, 363 S.C. 325, 330, 610 S.E.2d 504, 506 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, if there is any evidence to support the requested charge, the trial court should grant the request.Â  Williams, at 195, 624 S.E.2d at 445.\r\nDana argued at trial that he shot his brother in self-defense.Â  In South Carolina, four elements must exist for a defendant to be entitled to a self-defense charge: \r\n\r\n(1) the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent danger, defendant must show that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the belief that he was actually in imminent danger and that the circumstances were such as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss of his life; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger. \r\n\r\nState v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 416, 535 S.E.2d 431, 434 (2002) (citing State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 520 S.E.2d 319 (1999)).Â  \r\nBefore making its ruling in the current case, the trial court carefully and thoughtfully considered the propriety of charging the jury on self-defense.Â  The court was particularly concerned about the fourth element of the defense â€“ that Dana had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.Â  As the court noted, if James had been shot while he was still standing over Dana attempting to strike him, it would be clear that Dana would be entitled to the instruction.Â  However, Dana was no longer in danger when he fired the shot.Â  His own testimony belies his position.Â  Dana stated that James ran and that he was fifty feet away when the fatal shot was fired.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we agree with the trial court that the fourth element of self-defense was not proven and therefore, find the trial court did not err by refusing the instruction.\r\nAFFIRMED. [4]\r\nKITTREDGE and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although accounts of what happened next vary according to the different witnesses, for purposes of this opinion, we construe the facts as related by Danaâ€™s trial testimony.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Dana testified that he believed James was in a â€œdrug-induced rageâ€ and that his peculiar behavior resulted from being under the influence of some type of drug.Â  In fact, he testified that at one point during the beating he asked James what he â€œgot ahold ofâ€ and James responded that he got some really good drugs from North Carolina.Â  \r\n[3] Â Dana stated that he believed James was approximately 50 feet away when the shot was fired.Â  \r\n[4] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4122","title":"Grant v.

Grant, appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Mount Vernon Mills, Inc.Â  We affirm and hold that the termination provisions in the employee handbook did not apply to Grant (as a salaried employee), and that in any event, the termination policy provisions of the handbook are permissive in nature and did not alter the at-will relationship. \r\nI.\r\nWe apply the same standard as the circuit court when reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP;Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  To determine whether any material fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; Â Â \r\nOnce the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, the nonmoving party may not simply rest on the mere allegations contained in the pleadings.Â  Peterson v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œRather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).\r\n II. \r\nIn 1996, Grant began her salaried employment with Mount Vernon as a Pension Benefits Manager.Â  Grantâ€™s duties included processing monthly pensions payroll, conducting interviews with plan participants, and reviewing termination packages for terminated employees.Â  Grant received a copy of the employee handbook.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe employee handbook contains numerous policies, including Employment Policy and Practice, Union Policy, Relocation Policy, Jury Duty, Terminations, Employment of Family Relatives, and so forth.Â  Each policy in the manual hasâ€”at the top of the pageâ€”the term â€œCOVERAGE.â€Â  The policies apply to a variety of employee classifications.Â  Some policies apply to â€œALL EMPLOYEESâ€; some policies apply to â€œSALARIED EMPLOYEESâ€; some apply to â€œSALARIED EMPLOYEES â€“ EXEMPT AND NONEXEMPTâ€; some apply to â€œHOURLY EMPLOYEESâ€; some apply to â€œHOURLY NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEESâ€; and one policy applies to â€œFIRST LINE SUPERVISORS.â€ Â As noted, Grant was a salaried employee.\r\nAt issue here is the handbookâ€™s termination policy that provides â€œCOVERAGEâ€ for â€œHOURLY NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEESâ€ and states in relevant part:\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Policy\r\nIt is the policy of the Company to attempt to be fair and just in all dealings with employees.Â  For purposes of this policy, a termination is the result of any action initiated by the employee or the Company whereby the service record of the employee is broken.\r\n. . . .\r\nB. DisciplineÂ  \r\n1.Â  Notice of WarningsÂ  \r\na) Warnings are normally given as a result of an employeeâ€™s unsatisfactory conduct or performance.Â  The purpose of the warning is to serve notice to the employee that a continuation of the practice may result in discharge and to advise the employee that a change in conduct or performance must be made.Â  \r\nb) Warnings should be administered by the employeeâ€™s immediate supervisor and should be straight forward and sincere.Â  The supervisor should assume the responsibility and attitude of being helpful. \r\n. . . .\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discharge  \r\na)Â  The three warnings and final improper conduct or performance will result in discharge if all four take place in a twelve consecutive month period.\r\n. . . .\r\nd)Â  Immediate dischargeÂ  \r\n. . . .\r\n4) Offenses - It is not the Companyâ€™s intent to list in detail everything that an employee should or should not do under all circumstances.Â  The following offenses are only examples of the types of conduct which could result in immediate discharge:\r\n. . . .\r\nd) Creating discord or lack of harmony; . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nOn September 13, 2000, Grant met with three of her supervisors, Kent Harris, Ned Cochrane, and Gary Williams.Â  Grant was terminated, effective immediately.Â  The supervisors told Grant the reasons for her termination, and those reasons relate to their perception of Grantâ€™s poor work performance and her creating discord and lack of harmony in the workplace.Â  Harris informed Grant she was terminated for her performance problems and lack of effort to work in a team environment within the corporate setting.Â  Further, he stated she consistently displayed a poor attitude as evidenced by various emails she sent.Â  In one of those emails Grant complained about being asked to perform employee interviews.Â  She concluded by asking, â€œSo do we just get the crappy work dumped on us?â€Â  In addition to Grantâ€™s supervisorsâ€™ belief of her negative attitude towards employees and her work, Harris stated Grant performed her job poorly.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nGrant filed suit in the circuit court alleging race and sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as state claims for breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  \r\nMount Vernon removed the action to federal district court and filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims.Â  The federal district court granted Mount Vernon summary judgment as to the federal claims and remanded the various contract claims to state court.Â  \r\nOn remand to state court, Mount Vernon moved for summary judgment.Â  Mount Vernon alleged the various contract claims were premised on the existence of an employment contract, and no contract existed as a matter of law because Grant was employed at-will.Â  Mount Vernon maintained the employee handbook policy plainly stated the termination policy only applied to hourly nonexempt employees, and Grant was a salaried employee.Â  Mount Vernon contended that because the termination policy did not apply to Grant, her at-will status was not altered.Â Â  Accordingly, Mount Vernon claimed Grantâ€™s breach of contract claims failed as a matter of law.Â  \r\nGrant countered that during her employment she reviewed various salaried employee files that contained written warnings prior to termination.Â  Grant also submitted various affidavits from salaried employees who stated they received written warnings prior to termination.Â  Further, Grant submitted affidavits from two managers who stated they gave written warnings to salaried employees prior to termination.Â  Grantâ€™s position was and remains that if other salaried employees received warnings, so should she.\r\nGrant additionally relied on Mount Vernonâ€™s failure to insert a conspicuous disclaimer in the handbook to express its desire to maintain the at-will employment relationship.[1]Â  Therefore, Grant contended that a question of fact existed as to whether the handbook created a binding contract, meaning Grant could only be fired for cause.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted Mount Vernon summary judgment.Â  The circuit court reasoned the termination policy stated that coverage was for hourly nonexempt employees and because Grant was a salaried employee no ambiguity existed as to the fact she fell outside the scope of the policy.Â  Therefore, the circuit court found the employee handbook did not create a contract of employment that modified Grantâ€™s at-will status.Â  Moreover, the circuit court rejected Grantâ€™s reliance on Mount Vernonâ€™s decision to give warnings to other at-will employees and not her.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nIII.\r\nGrant maintains the circuit court erred in concluding Mount Vernonâ€™s employee handbook, as a matter of law, did not alter Grantâ€™s status as an at-will employee.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized the doctrine of employment at-will.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 471, 611 S.E.2d 905, 910-11 (2005) (Conner II); Shealy v. Fowler, 182 S.C. 81, 87, 188 S.E. 499, 502 (1936) (â€œ[a] contract for permanent employment, so long as it is satisfactorily performed, which is not supported by any consideration other than the obligation of service to be performed on the one hand and wages to be paid on the other, is terminable at the pleasure of either party.â€).Â  This doctrine allows either party to terminate the employment â€œfor any reason or no reasonâ€ without being subject to a claim for breach of contract, subject to narrow exceptions and prohibitions against illegal discrimination which are not present here.Â  Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., Inc., 360 S.C. 58, 67, 599 S.E.2d 456, 460 (2004); see also Conner II, 363 S.C. at 471, 611 S.E.2d at 910.Â  The at-will employment doctrine is essentially an economic incentive that provides critically needed flexibility in the marketplace.Â  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Co-op., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334-35, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999).\r\nWhen the at-will status of an employee is altered by the terms of an employee handbook, however, a contract may arise allowing for a cause of action for wrongful discharge.Â  Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 484, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454 (1987).Â Â  \r\nWhen the evidence conflicts or is capable of more than one inference, the issue of whether an employee handbook constitutes a contract should be submitted to the jury; however, â€œâ€˜a court should intervene to resolve the handbook issue as a matter of law . . . if the handbook statements and the disclaimer, taken together, establish beyond any doubt tha[t] an enforceable promise either does or does not exist.â€™â€Â  Hessenthaler v. Tri-County Sister Help, Inc., 365 S.C. 101, 108, 616 S.E.2d 694, 697 (2005) (quoting Stephen F. Befort, Employee Handbooks and the Legal Effect of Disclaimers, 13 Indus. Rel. L.J. 326, 375-76 (1991-92)).Â  \r\nThe typical handbook employment case may be resolved by making three determinations.Â  A handbook forms an employment contract when: (1) the handbook provision(s) and procedure(s) in question apply to the employee, (2) the handbook sets out procedures binding on the employer, and (3) the handbook does not contain a conspicuous and appropriate disclaimer.Â  See Conner II, 363 S.C. at 472, 611 S.E.2d at 911; see also Williams v. Riedman, 339 S.C. 251, 259-60, 529 S.E.2d 28, 32 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Miller v. Schmid Labs., Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 414 S.E.2d 126 (1992)).Â  \r\nIn determining whether the handbook sets out procedures that bind an employer, we must first determineâ€”because of the procedural posture of this caseâ€”whether the employee is covered by the policy provision in question.Â  If the employee is not covered, then the handbook would not form the basis of an employment contract.Â  \r\nAssuming an employee is covered by the relevant provision in the handbook, we next determine whether the handbook sets out binding procedures on the employer.Â  In this regard, in the absence of a conspicuous and appropriate disclaimer, if the language in the handbook sets out mandatory, progressive discipline procedures, those procedures alter the at-will employment relationship.Â  When an employer discharges a covered employee without adhering to the mandatory procedures, the employee may maintain an action for wrongful discharge against the employer. See Hessenthaler, 365 S.C. at 108-09, 616 S.E.2d at 697-98 (citing Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 463-64, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610-11 (2002) (Conner I)).\r\nMandatory discipline procedures â€œtypically provide that an employee may be fired only after certain steps are taken.Â  When definite and mandatory, these procedures impose a limitation on the employerâ€™s right to terminate an employee at any time, for any reason.â€ Â Hessenthaler, 365 S.C. at 109, 616 S.E.2d at 698.Â  Permissive language in an employee handbook, on the other hand, does not alter an employeeâ€™s at-will status.Â  See Horton 360 S.C. at 67-68, 599 S.E.2d at 461 (affirming summary judgment for employer when handbook provided discipline procedures that contained permissive language).Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Mount Vernonâ€™s employee handbook termination policy does not apply to Grant, a salaried employee.\r\nGrant contends a jury question exists as to whether the employee handbookâ€™s termination policy applies to her.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe employee handbookâ€™s termination policy unambiguously states that it applies to hourly nonexempt employees.Â  Grant was a salaried, not an hourly, employee.Â  According to Grant, she was a â€œsalaried non-exempt employee.â€ Â App. Br. at 10.Â  Grant focuses exclusively on the exempt versus nonexempt issue.[2]Â Â  We need not reach the issue of whether Grant was exempt or nonexempt, for she was indisputably not an hourly employee.Â  Because Grant was not an hourly nonexempt employee, the termination policy in the handbook did not apply to her. \r\nGrant additionally argues that because the termination provision provides that the company policy is to be â€œfair and just in all dealings with employees,â€ the termination provision applies to all employees, including salaried and hourly employees.Â  The phrase â€œemployeesâ€ in the body of the provision may not be properly read to broaden the coverage beyond that clearly set forth in the heading of the policy.Â  This general policy statementâ€”to be â€œfair and justâ€â€”does not somehow expand the class of Mount Vernon employees to whom this provision applies. This provision, by unmistakable language, is limited to hourly nonexempt employees.Â Â  \r\nBeyond this, the law does not sanction the leap advocated by Grant.Â  For a general policy statement to be enforceable as a contract, the statement â€œmust be definitive in nature, promising specific treatment in specific situations.â€Â  Hessenthaler, 365 S.C. at 110, 616 S.E.2d at 698 (finding that because nondiscrimination provision was not specific and did not make any promises regarding disciplinary procedure or termination decisions, the handbook did not contain promises enforceable as a contract).Â  The policy statement of Mount Vernon to be â€œfair and justâ€ does not create an expectation that employment is guaranteed or that a particular process must be complied with before an employee is terminated.Â  Consequently, the policy statement does not create a contract or otherwise alter Grantâ€™s at-will status.\r\nGrant seeks to avoid the coverage limitation in the termination policy by claiming that her termination is governed by the â€œATTENDANCEâ€ policy, which applies to â€œALL EMPLOYEES.â€Â  This argument finds insufficient traction in the record.Â  Grant recalled in her deposition testimony that the reason given at the September 13, 2000, meeting for her termination was that she was â€œnot a team player.â€Â  The balance of the record is consistent with Grantâ€™s recollection of the September 13 meeting in which she was terminated for her poor attitude and â€œnot working as part of a team.â€Â  Grant points to the September 13 memorandum of Gary Williams which contains, among many other things, a reference to Grantâ€™s propensity for arriving late for work and leaving early as â€œone contributing factor to the overall problem â€“ an example of how her attitude has affected her performance [at Mount Vernon].â€Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the assessment of the circuit court that the language of the attendance policy would create an issue of fact if the evidence could reasonably support the conclusion that Grant was terminated for attendance reasons.Â  The evidence (in a light most favorable to Grant) establishes, however, that Grantâ€™s alleged attendance related issues were only an adjunct in the decision to terminate her.Â  As former Chief Justice Littlejohn observed, we are not â€œrequired to single out some one morsel of evidence and attach to it great significance when patently the evidence is introduced solely in a vain attempt to create an issue of fact that is not genuine.â€Â  Main v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 527, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984).&nbsp;\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  An employee handbook couched in permissive language does not alter the at-will employment relationship.\r\nAlthough Grant may not avail herself of the termination policy due to her status as a salaried employee, we address Grantâ€™s contention that a handbook (whether couched in mandatory or permissive language) always alters the at-will relationship of the employer and employee absent a conspicuous disclaimer to the contrary.&nbsp; In support of her argument, Grant cites to the supreme courtâ€™s statement in Conner I â€œthat if an employer wishes to issue written policies, but intends to continue at-will employment [and not be bound by the polices], the employer must insert a conspicuous disclaimer into the handbook.â€&nbsp; Conner I, 348 S.C. at 463, 560 S.E.2d at 611.\r\nGrant, however, overlooks that the analysis in Conner I is based upon mandatory language that binds the employer.&nbsp; See Connor I, 348 S.C. at 464, 560 S.E.2d at 611.Â  The supreme court observed in Conner I that â€œ[i]t is patently unjust to allow an employer to couch a handbook, bulletin, or other similar material in mandatory terms and then allow him to ignore these very policies.â€Â  Conner I, 348 S.C. at 463, 560 S.E.2d at 610 (quoting Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. at 485, 357 S.E.2d at 455).\r\nIn the present case, because nothing in the employee handbook outlined progressive disciplinary procedures in mandatory terms, the presumption that the employment was at-will was not rebutted and no disclaimer was needed.Â  Accordingly, we hold the handbook did not contain promises enforceable in contract.Â  \r\nEven assuming Grant may avail herself of Mount Vernonâ€™s termination policy, her contract claims must nevertheless fail.Â  The permissive nature of the termination policy compels this result.Â  Nothing in the employee handbook required Mount Vernon to give warnings to an employee before termination.Â  The handbook provides: â€œWarnings are normally given as a result of an employeeâ€™s unsatisfactory conduct or performance.â€ (emphasis added).Â  Moreover, the handbook states that if a warning is given then â€œ[w]arnings should be administered by the employeeâ€™s immediate supervisor and should be straight forward and sincere.â€Â  Therefore, a plain reading of the handbook shows that a supervisor may give a warning, but is not required to do so.Â  If a warning is given, then the handbook provides procedures on how the warning should be administered.[3]\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Grantâ€™s status as an at-will employee is not altered by MountÂ Â Â Â  Vernonâ€™s election to give a warning to other salaried employees.\r\nGrantâ€™s final argument is premised on the notion that an employer may not treat at-will employees differently.Â  Grant points to evidence of other salaried employees receiving warnings.Â  If other presumably at-will employees received warnings instead of dismissal, then Grant contends she is legally entitled to the same consideration.Â  Although the law prohibits illegal discrimination, Grant makes no such claim to us.Â  The record provides little in terms of the at-will salaried employees who were given warnings.Â  We do not know the tenure of these employees, Mount Vernonâ€™s perception of the value of these employees, and the nature of the alleged misconduct of these employees.Â  We decline to speculate that the circumstances of these examples of salaried employees receiving warnings mirror Grantâ€™s situation.\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that Grantâ€™s reference to other salaried employees receiving warnings does not create a question of fact.Â  Absent a claim of illegal discrimination, an employeeâ€™s status as an at-will employee is not altered by an employerâ€™s decision to give a warning to other at-will employees.\r\nThe rule could not be otherwise without wreaking havoc on the at-will employment doctrine.Â  Employers routinely give warnings to at-will employees when no warning is legally required.Â  But those at-will employees who are summarily fired and do not receive warnings may not (absent illegal discrimination) bootstrap an employerâ€™s unrelated judgment in another employeeâ€™s situation to alter the at-will relationship and create a contract of employment.Â  From the employerâ€™s perspective, that is the essence of the at-will employment relationship.\r\nSay, for example, an employer has two at-will employees who have committed the same infraction and assume the absence of illegal discrimination.Â  Employee A has worked for employer for ten years, and employer perceives employee A as a long time valued employee.Â  Employer elects to give employee A a warning.Â  Assume employee B has worked for employer for one year and employer perceives employee B as only a marginally adequate employee.Â  Employer elects to fire employee B.Â  Does employerâ€™s decision to give employee A a warning alter employee Bâ€™s at-will status, entitling employee B to a warning?Â  The answer is â€œno.â€Â  The result would be the same if we reversed the hypothetical.Â  Though illogical, the at-will employment doctrine would allow the employer to fire employee A and merely warn employee B.Â  Absent a contract of employment or other legally cognizable claim, courts have no business interfering with employersâ€™ decisions to warn or fire at-will employees.Â  \r\nWe additionally conclude that Mount Vernonâ€™s perception that it had cause for terminating Grant does not alter the at-will relationship.Â  Employers will almost always believe there is â€œgood causeâ€ for terminating an employee, including an at-will employee.Â  The fact that an employer claims it takes no disciplinary action without a good reason does not mean the employer can only act in the presence of a good reason.Â  This court reached a similar result in Davis v. Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement Comâ€™n, 344 S.C. 240, 542 S.E.2d 755 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Davis claimed an employment contract was created when his employer told him â€œhe could â€˜only be terminated for cause.â€™â€Â  Id. at 249, 542 S.E.2d at 760.Â  We held such a statement â€œinsufficient by itself to provide a factual issue as to alteration of Davisâ€™s at-will employment status.â€Â  Id. (citing with approval Montgomery County Hosp. Dist. v. Brown, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex. 1998) (statements that an employee will be discharged only for â€œgood reasonâ€ or â€œgood causeâ€ do not form a binding contract â€œwhen there is no agreement on what those terms encompass. Without such agreement the employee cannot reasonably expect to limit the employerâ€™s right to terminate him.â€)).Â Â  \r\nIV. \r\nWe find Mount Vernonâ€™s termination policy did not apply to Grant as a salaried employee, and for the reasons discussed above, we hold that an at-will employment relationship existed between Grant and Mount Vernon.Â  We join the circuit court in concluding that Mount Vernon was entitled to summary judgment.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The title page of the handbook (entitled â€œEmployee Policies and Procedures On-Line Guideâ€) states that the â€œon-line policy guide is not intended to bind the Company or any employee to a specific period of employment.â€Â  This language was neither bold nor capitalized. \r\n[2]&nbsp; The parties have not developed the status of Grant as exempt or nonexempt as significant to a resolution of this appeal.Â  From our review of the record, it appears this issue may have been relevant in the adjudication of Grantâ€™s previously dismissed federal claims.Â  For example, Grant submitted an affidavit in opposition to the summary judgment motion filed in federal court, in which Grantâ€™s expert opined that, for purposes of exemption from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Grant was â€œnot an â€˜exemptâ€™ employeeâ€ with Mount Vernon. \r\n[3]&nbsp; This serves as an additional sustaining ground.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (â€œ[A] respondent . . . may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the lower courtâ€™s ruling, regardless of whether those reasons have been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4125","title":"SCDSS v.

Â \r\nBy order dated June 25, 2000, the court ordered the petit larceny charge expunged.Â  The order was forwarded to SLED for execution.Â  SLED wrote a letter to the judge requesting advice as SLEDâ€™s records showed Fryer was not eligible for expungement of the petit larceny charge.Â  However, SLED did not move for reconsideration or appeal the 2000 order.Â  \r\nSLED did not expunge the petit larceny charge.Â  In April of 2002, after Fryer learned the charge had not been expunged, he again petitioned for expungement of the petit larceny charge based on the June 25, 2000 order.Â  The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the petition.\r\nThe trial court made the factual finding that Fryer was arrested once based on the vending machine incident and both charges stemmed from that incident.Â  Fryer and his mother each testified there was only one arrest arising from a single incident.Â  SLED employee Joseph E. Means, Jr. admitted that SLED expunges multiple offenses arising from a single arrest.Â  SLED contended, however, that because the fingerprint cards were dated over a week apart, and because the warrants for the two offenses were not in numeric order, there must have been two arrests arising from two incidents.Â  \r\nBy order dated August 4, 2004, the court, interpreting Fryerâ€™s petition as a petition for a writ of mandamus, found one arrest arising from a single incident, concluded the 2000 order was valid, and granted mandamus.Â  SLED appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSLED argues the 2000 order expunging the petit larceny charge is void because it is in violation of South Carolina Code section 22-5-910.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nThe 2000 order of expungement is not void.Â  A void judgment is one that, from its inception, is a complete nullity and is without legal effect and must be distinguished from one that is merely voidable.Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995).Â  â€œThe definition of â€˜voidâ€™ . . . encompasses judgments from courts which . . . lacked subject matter jurisdiction . . . .â€Â  McDaniel v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Irregularities not involving jurisdiction do not render a judgment void.Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co., 318 S.C. at 291, 457 S.E.2d at 343. \r\nAlthough SLED does not directly challenge the circuit courtâ€™s specific power to expunge under the statute, SLED argues the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case because of the statuteâ€™s prohibition against more than one expungement.Â  We disagree.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005).Â  The circuit court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction over Fryerâ€™s petition.Â  Because the court had subject matter jurisdiction, SLED should have directly appealed the 2000 order.Â  â€œThere is a wide difference between a want of jurisdiction in which case the court has no power to adjudicate at all, and a mistake in the exercise of undoubted jurisdiction in which case the action of the trial court is not void although it may be subject to direct attack on appeal.â€Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co., 318 S.C. at 291, 457 S.E.2d at 343.Â  When a court acts with proper subject matter jurisdiction, but takes action outside of its authority, the party against whom the act is done must object and directly appeal.Â  Coon v. Coon, 356 S.C. 342, 347-48, 588 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d as modified, 364 S.C. 563, 614 S.E.2d 616 (2005).\r\nSLED next argues the trial court erred in granting mandamus in the 2004 order.Â  SLED argues mandamus was neither requested nor deserved.Â  We find SLED has failed to preserve this issue.Â  A post-trial motion must be made when the trial court either grants relief not requested or rules on an issue not raised at trial. Â Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, Inc. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 60, 427 S.E.2d 673, 675 (1993).\r\nSLED finally argues the trial court erred in finding res judicata and estoppel applied to SLEDâ€™s challenge of the 2000 order because there was no litigation prior to the issuance of the 2000 order.Â  Based on our finding that the 2000 order was not void and SLED did not appeal the order, we decline to reach the issues of res judicata and estoppel.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Section 22-5-910 provides, inter alia, for the expungement of first offense convictions in magistrate court, after three years, provided the defendant has no other conviction during the three-year period.Â  S.C.

Â Robert Franklin Atkins was employed by Moore Express, Inc., a package delivery sub-contractor for Airborne.Â  In late July of 2000, Atkins, a convicted felon, delivered a package to the Carpenter home.Â  He returned to the home on August 4th dressed in his Airborne uniform and driving an Airborne delivery vehicle, gained entry to the premises, and attacked Jessica.Â  \r\nCarpenter, in his capacity as Jessicaâ€™s personal representative, filed a wrongful death and survival action against Airborne, Moore, and Atkins.Â  Moore was insured by Companion under a commercial general liability policy.[1]Â  Airborne was named as an additional insured.Â  Companion filed a declaratory judgment action contending that under the terms of the policy it was not required to defend Airborne or Moore because Jessicaâ€™s murder was not an â€œoccurrenceâ€ as contemplated by the terms of the policy, and, further, fell within the intentional acts exclusion of the policy.Â  The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment in Companionâ€™s favor.Â  Airborne and Carpenter appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Cowburn v. Leventis, 360 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Trousdell v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 639, 572 S.E.2d 264, 265 (2002)).Â  Summary judgment should be affirmed if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  â€œOur standard of review in evaluating a motion for summary judgment is to liberally construe the record in favor of the nonmoving party and give the nonmoving party the benefit of all favorable inferences that might reasonably be drawn therefrom.â€Â  Estes v. Roper Temp. Servs., Inc., 304 S.C. 120, 121, 403 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1991). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAirborne appeals the trial courtâ€™s determination that Carpenterâ€™s complaint failed to allege an â€œoccurrenceâ€ within the contemplation of the terms of the policy and that the intentional acts exclusion of the policy precludes coverage.[2]Â  Carpenter contends the court improperly applied the summary judgment standard by finding inferences in favor of the moving party, Companion.Â  \r\nAs a preliminary matter, we must determine which stateâ€™s law applies.Â  In construing insurance policies, South Carolina courts apply the law of the state where the policy was issued.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155-56, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (2000).Â  Moore is a Georgia corporation, and the policy was issued and delivered to Moore in Georgia.Â  Consequently, Georgia law governs our application and interpretation of the policy.Â  All parties agree the application of Georgia law is appropriate.\r\nAn insurerâ€™s duty to defend is determined by examining the allegations contained in the complaint and comparing them to the coverage provided by the policy.Â  Batson-Cooke Co. v. Aetna Ins. Co., 409 S.E.2d 41, 42-43 (Ga. App. 1991).Â  In the instant case, the underlying complaint states claims for wrongful death and survival.Â  In stating his claims, Carpenter alleges that Airborne and Moore were negligent in failing to conduct a background investigation of Atkins prior to hiring him, in failing to warn customers that delivery persons had not been subject to background checks, in failing to conduct periodic background checks once employees were hired, and in inducing customers to believe that delivery persons are agents and representatives of Airborne, all resulting in Atkinsâ€™ assault of Jessica.Â  \r\nThe initial allegation, that Airborne and Moore were negligent in Atkinsâ€™ assault of Jessica, appears to rest solely on the theory of vicarious liability; i.e., the employeeâ€™s conduct is imputed to his employer.Â  The remaining allegations, however, seem to assert separate negligent acts or omissions on the part of Airborne and Moore that contributed to Jessicaâ€™s assault and death.Â  Having preliminarily examined the allegations in the complaint, we must now compare those allegations with the coverage provided by the relevant provisions in the policy.\r\nMooreâ€™s CGL policy provides the following:\r\n\r\nThis insurance applies to â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ only if:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n          The â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ is caused by an â€œoccurrenceâ€ that takes place in the â€œcoverage territory[.]â€ Â \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nOccurrence is defined in the policy as â€œan accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.â€Â  Airborne argues that whether Jessicaâ€™s murder was an â€œaccidentâ€ must be viewed not from Atkinsâ€™ standpoint, but from the standpoint of Airborne and Moore under the Georgia case of Crook v. Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 428 S.E.2d 802 (Ga. App. 1993).Â  In Crook, the son of the plaintiffs in the underlying suit committed an intentional act that resulted in his death.Â  Id. at 802-03.Â  The parents sued Crook, who was characterized as an innocent bystander, apparently on the theory that he should have intervened to prevent the son from suffering the fatal consequence of his own voluntary act.Â  Id.Â  Crook was insured under a homeownerâ€™s policy issued by Georgia Farm Bureau, which defended under a reservation of rights and brought a declaratory judgment action asserting it owed no duty to defend because the sonâ€™s death was the result of an intentional act on his part.Â  Id. at 803.Â  The sonâ€™s death was therefore not an â€œoccurrenceâ€ as defined by the policy terms.Â  Id. The Georgia Court of Appeals determined that although the sonâ€™s intentional act caused his own death, as to Crook, who was the insured and apparently took no active role in the occurrence that caused the sonâ€™s death, the event was â€œclearly an â€˜accident,â€™ because it was an unintentional event which took place without [Crookâ€™s] â€˜foresight or expectation or design.â€™â€Â  Id. Â Â The court insinuated that the underlying tort action could be considered â€œgroundless,â€ but that had no bearing on the decision whether Farm Bureau owed Crook the duty of providing him a defense.Â  Id.\r\nEven if Crook supports the notion that an intentional act committed by one party may be considered an accident as to an insured in certain circumstances, it does not support Airborneâ€™s main contention.Â  In Crook, the intentional act causing the ultimate event complained of was committed by a total stranger to the policy, and such act was not attributable, either vicariously or otherwise, to the insured.Â  To interpret Crook to mean that the intentional acts of Atkins are completely severable from Moore and Airborne would require us to disregard other more recent, and more on point, precedents.\r\nSubsequent Georgia case law appears to support the conclusion urged upon us by Companion that, because Atkinsâ€™ acts were clearly intentional, the claims by Carpenter are not covered.[3]Â  Oâ€™Dell v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 478 S.E.2d 418 (Ga. App. 1996), is a coverage case that arose as a result of an employeeâ€™s suit against the employer, Oâ€™Dell, and his two companies,\r\nDRACS Consulting Group, Inc. (DRACS) and Direct Recruiting Associates (DRA), for sexual harassment and assault and battery.Â  Id. at 419.Â  The court determined that the sexual harassment claims did not constitute â€œbodily injuryâ€ as required by the policy, and the assault and battery did not constitute an event under the policy as such acts were clearly intentional and not accidental.Â  Id. at 420.Â  Most significantly, the court went on to address potential negligence claims against DRACS and DRA arising from the underlying assault and battery and sexual harassment claims.\r\n\r\nOâ€™Dell also claims that St. Paul must defend the lawsuit on behalf of DRACS and DRA because [plaintiff] alleged facts on which a cause of action for negligent retention of Oâ€™Dell could be based.Â  We note initially that the policy does not recite that it covers losses due to negligent retention.Â  But even if this were true, the complaint does not allege that [plaintiff] suffered bodily injuries, and even assuming she did suffer bodily injuries, she did not allege that those injuries were caused by an accident and thus were brought about by an â€œevent.â€ Â \r\n\r\nId.Â  (emphasis in original).\r\nWe find the factual scenario in Oâ€™Dell so similar to those in the instant case that we consider the holding therein to be controlling here.Â  In Oâ€™Dell, the plaintiff alleged an intentional tort, sexual harassment, and brought a claim of negligent retention against DRACS and DRA.Â  The Georgia Court of Appeals concluded that the negligent retention claim specifically was not a covered â€œeventâ€ under the CGL policy because the plaintiff did not allege her injuries were caused by an accident.Â  \r\nIn this case, the plaintiff has alleged intentional acts, assault and murder, and has asserted a negligence claim against Moore and Airborne.Â  We are compelled to conclude, as did the court in Oâ€™Dell, that the negligence claims against Airborne do not constitute an â€œoccurrence,â€ as Carpenter does not allege Jessicaâ€™s injuries were caused by an accident.Â  As a result, the claims against Airborne are not covered under the policy.Â  \r\nThe decision of the Eleventh Circuit in SCI Liquidating Corp. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 181 F.3d 1210 (1999), supports our interpretation of Oâ€™Dell by stating, â€œ[t]he Georgia Court [in Oâ€™Dell] concluded that the plaintiffâ€™s negligent retention claims also were not covered, because, among other things, the plaintiff â€˜did not allege that those injuries were caused by an accident and thus were brought about by an â€˜event.â€™â€Â  Id. at 1216.Â  The court in SCI Liquidating also declined to rely on Crook recognizing, as we do, a distinction between Crook and cases like the one before us.Â  See id. at 1216-17.\r\nBecause we conclude Carpenterâ€™s complaint does not allege an occurrence under the policy, thereby negating Companionâ€™s obligation to defend, we decline to address whether the policyâ€™s intentional act exclusion is applicable.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR; Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 498, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (â€œ[A]n appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive.â€).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;\r\nMoore also had a commercial automobile policy through Companion, and both Moore and Airborne sought coverage under that policy as well.Â  Coverage under that policy is not an issue in this appeal.\r\n[2]&nbsp;\r\nAirborne and Carpenter also contend that the cases relied upon by Companion are factually distinct from this case.Â  As that question is essentially part and parcel of the central issue on appeal, we do not address it separately.\r\n[3]&nbsp;\r\nThe policy at issue also contains a â€œseparation of insuredsâ€ clause that indicates each insured will be treated severally under the policy.Â  Had this issue been sufficiently preserved by having been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, this case would potentially require a different analysis.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (holding that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4126","title":"Wright v.

Hicks Harwell.Â  Dickey attended this hearing.Â  Because Wright appeared pro se, Judge Harwell granted 15 days for Wright to retain counsel.Â  Judge Harwell subsequently recused himself.Â  The Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an order reassigning the matter to Judge Edward B. Cottingham.Â  \r\nThe hearing was rescheduled for April 5, 2004, and Dickey was properly notified by certified mail.Â  Dickey knew of this hearing, for he again requested a continuance.Â  Dickey failed to appear at the hearing.Â  As noted, Dickey failed to file a brief or memorandum specifying the grounds for his appeal.Â  The circuit court entered an order dismissing the appeal with prejudice.Â  \r\nDickey filed a motion to alter or amend, contending that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, and that the circuit court judge erred in refusing to recuse himself from the case.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, finding that: (1) Dickey received proper notice and willfully failed to attend the hearing; and (2) Dickey never filed a motion requesting recusal and failed to provide any evidence of a conflict of interest or other reason requiring recusal.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nII.\r\nWe find this court lacks jurisdiction to review this appeal.Â  Rule 201(a), SCACR, provides that appeals â€œmay be taken, as provided by law, from any final judgment or appealable order.â€Â  (Emphasis added.) Â Â In the civil arena, â€œ[t]he right of appeal arises from and is controlled by statutory law.â€Â  N.C. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Twin States Dev. Corp.,&nbsp;289 S.C. 480, 481, 347 S.E.2d 97, 97&nbsp;(1986).Â  \r\nThe criteria for determining appealability are set forth in sections 14-3-320 and -330 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-9-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  Section 14-3-320 provides for appellate jurisdiction in equity cases.[2]Â  Section 14-3-330 provides that appellate courts â€œshall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases . . . .â€Â  We are not, however, presented with a typical action at law or equity, but a specialized proceeding before a branch of the South Carolina Bar, which in turn is an administrative arm of the South Carolina Supreme Court.\r\nThe case of Kores Nordic (USA) Corp. v. Sinkler, Gibbs &amp; Simons, 284 S.C. 513, 327 S.E.2d 365 (Ct. App. 1985), is instructive.Â  Kores Nordic submitted a fee dispute with the Sinkler law firm to the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board.Â  Id. at 514, 327 S.E.2d at 365.Â  At the time, the applicable rules did not provide for any appeal of the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  Dissatisfied with the decision of the Board, Kores Nordic sought an appeal to the circuit court under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).Â  The circuit court dismissed the attempted appeal, and this court affirmed.Â  The APA â€œrequires as a prerequisite to judicial review that a final decision in a contested case have been rendered by an â€˜agency.â€™â€Â  Id. at 515, 327 S.E.2d at 366.Â  We held that the Board, as part of the South Carolina Bar (and hence our supreme court), was not an â€œagencyâ€ within the ambit of the APA.Â  Id. at 516, 327 S.E.2d at 366.Â  \r\nSubsequent to our opinion in Kores Nordic, Rule 416 was amended to provide for a limited right of appeal to the circuit court.Â  The rule (Rule 20 within SCACR Rule 416) provides that a party may appeal a final decision of the Board to the circuit court on certain limited grounds.Â  No mention is made of further appeal.Â  Indeed, further appeal runs contrary to the Boardâ€™s purpose of expeditious resolution of fee disputes.Â  See Rule 416, SCACR, Rule 2 (â€œThe purpose of the Board is to establish procedures whereby a dispute concerning fees . . . may be resolved expeditiously . . . .â€); Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 433-34, 468 S.E.2d 861, 865 (1996) (recognizing that where a statute specifically sets forth an appeals procedure, we may not expand our jurisdiction through implication).\r\nIII.\r\nWe conclude there is no appeal from a decision of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board of the South Carolina Bar beyond the circuit court as set forth in Rule 416, SCACR, Rule 20.Â  This appeal is\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;\r\nWe decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp;\r\nSection 14-3-320 has been declared unconstitutional to the extent it purports to limit the scope of appellate review in domestic cases.Â  Rutherford v.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor RandolphÂ  Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Christopher Santiago appeals his convictions of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, alleging the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury on self-defense and in excluding testimony of a forensic psychiatrist.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the summer of 2002, Santiago and Kate Wisn lived together at the Hilton Head vacation home of Kateâ€™s parents.Â  When Kateâ€™s father, Joe (hereinafter â€œWisnâ€), visited Hilton Head in July, he informed Santiago that he and Kate needed to move out of the home within the next two weeks.Â  That evening, Santiago left the home and drove to New Jersey to live with his parents.Â  After a brief stay in New Jersey, Santiago returned to South Carolina and began renting an apartment near the vacation home.Â  \r\nAccording to Santiago, on the morning of August 9, 2002, he left his apartment with a 20-gauge shotgun in the trunk of his car with the intent to commit suicide.Â Â  Before taking his own life, he called his parents to tell them goodbye.Â  They convinced him to see his psychiatrist, who was able to talk Santiago out of committing suicide. [1] \r\nWhen Santiago returned to his apartment, he had a message on his answering machine from Wisn, requesting that Santiago come to the vacation home to pick up some belongings.Â  Upon his arrival at Wisnâ€™s home, Santiago saw his belongings packed in a container beside Wisnâ€™s car in the driveway.Â  Santiago rummaged through the container in search of a favorite belt but was unable to find it.Â  He rang the doorbell; Wisn answered, and the two men went inside to search for the belt.Â  \r\nAccording to Santiago, he began to cry while looking for the belt, and Wisn ridiculed him.Â  At that point Santiago left the house, but Wisn followed him.Â  Santiago testified that Wisn told him to â€œstay the fâ€” away from my daughter.â€ Â Santiago walked past the container of his belongings, but Wisn picked it up and walked around to the back of Santiagoâ€™s car to place it in the trunk.Â  After Santiago opened the trunk, Wisn placed the container into it and noticed the 20-gauge shotgun.Â  Wisn looked at the shotgun, looked at Santiago, and then looked at the shotgun again.Â  Santiago testified he thought Wisn was about to grab the shotgun, so he took the gun from the trunk and pointed it at Wisn.Â Â Â  Santiago took a step back.Â  Wisn told Santiago â€œdonâ€™t be fâ€”ing stupid.â€ Â Santiago testified he thought Wisn was about to reach for the gun so he opened fire.Â  He shot Wisn four times, and Wisn later died from his wounds.Â  \r\nAfter fleeing the scene, Santiago drove to a fire station, and told the firemen that he shot someone on Hilton Head who had â€œruined his life.â€Â  Â Â A fireman called the police, and the police sent detective Leland Tuten to investigate.Â  Detective Tuten provided Santiago with a Miranda [2]  rights and waiver form, which Santiago initialed and signed.Â  Tuten then provided Santiago with a pen and paper, and Santiago drafted a confession.Â  In this confession, Santiago explained that while he lived with Kate, Wisn tried to turn her family members against him.Â  He wrote he planned to marry Kate, but his plan fell through because Wisn kicked him out of the house.Â  Santiago also admitted he shot Wisn four times with the shotgun.Â  The confession went on to describe the shooting.Â  Santiago said he was standing near the back of his car when he fired on Wisn, who was standing near the front of the car. [3] Â  After Santiago confessed to the shooting, Tuten arrested him. Santiago was subsequently indicted for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  \r\nDuring trial, Santiago attempted to present testimony from Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, a forensic psychiatrist, who, prior to trial, had diagnosed Santiago with a condition called aspergerâ€™s disorder, a subset of autism.Â  Santiago argued Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony would be relevant to his mental state at the time of the shooting and would also support a finding that Santiago committed voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.Â  The trial judge refused to allow her testimony into evidence, finding it was not relevant because South Carolina does not recognize the defense of diminished capacity.Â  The trial court also rejected Santiagoâ€™s request to charge the jury with self-defense.Â Â Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Santiago of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.Â  The judge sentenced Santiago to life imprisonment without parole.Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Self-Defense Charge \r\nSantiago first argues the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  We disagree. \r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000); State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 624 S.E.2d 443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If there is any evidence to support a jury charge, the trial judge should grant the requested charge.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  The refusal to grant a requested jury charge that states a sound principle of law applicable to the case at hand is an error of law.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 390, 529 S.E.2d at 539.Â  To warrant a reversal, however, the error must result in prejudice to the party requesting the charge.Â  Id.Â  A self-defense charge is not required unless the evidence supports it.Â  State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).Â  \r\nTo establish self defense in South Carolina, four elements must be present: (1) the defendant was without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the defendant actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonable, prudent person of ordinary fitness and courage would have entertained the same belief; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury other than to act as he did.Â  Jackson v. State, 355 S.C. 568, 570-71, 586 S.E.2d 562, 562 (2003); State v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 416, 535 S.E.2d 431, 434 (2000).Â  If there is any evidence of self-defense, the issue must be submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 260, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).Â  In charging self-defense, the trial judge should consider the facts and circumstances of the case and fashion an appropriate charge.Â  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 322, 531 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2000).Â  The trial judge commits reversible error if he or she fails to give a charge on an issue raised by the evidence and requested by the defendant.Â  State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380 S.E.2d 834, 836 (1989).Â Â Â  \r\nHere, the record does not support a charge of self-defense for several reasons.Â  First, the evidence does not support a finding that Santiago was without fault in bringing about the difficulty.Â  Santiago had gone to Wisnâ€™s house with a loaded gun in his vehicle, and that weapon was apparently observed by Wisn as he lifted Santiagoâ€™s belongings into the car.Â  Although Santiago asserted that Wisn verbally berated him as he looked for his favorite belt, these words were never accompanied by a hostile act.Â  While we recognize that, depending on the circumstances, words accompanied by hostile acts may establish self-defense, there was no evidence of a hostile act by Wisn.Â  See State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 444, 377 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1989); State v. Harvey, 220 S.C. 506, 518, 68 S.E.2d 409, 414 (1951) (â€œ[W]here death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon, words alone, however opprobrious, are not sufficient to constitute a legal provocation.â€).Â  \r\nSantiago argues the hostile act occurred when Wisn looked at the gun, looked at Santiago, and then looked at the gun again.Â  This bare assertion is insufficient to establish a hostile act by Wisn. Â Santiago never claimed Wisn made a move for the gun before Santiago took it from the trunk.Â  Even assuming, as Santiago testified, that Wisn reached for the gun while in Santiagoâ€™s hands, he did so after Santiago brought about the difficulty by removing the shotgun from the trunk and aiming it at Wisn.[4]Â  Therefore, no question of fact for the jury is created on the first prong of self-defense.Â  \r\nWhile Santiago asserts he actually believed he was in imminent danger, the third prong of self-defense cannot be established because a reasonable, prudent person of ordinary fitness and courage would not have feared for his life or serious bodily injury under the circumstances of this case.Â  Santiago testified that he and Wisn had never had a physical altercation, nor had Wisn ever threatened to kill or cause serious injury to Santiago before the shooting.Â  Additionally, the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to Santiago, demonstrates that Wisn merely looked at the shotgun, looked at Santiago, and then looked at the shotgun again.Â  Accordingly, no reasonable person would have feared for his life simply because of Wisnâ€™s actions of looking.Â  Therefore, no question of fact for the jury is created on this element of self-defense.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, the fourth prong of self-defense cannot be satisfied because Santiago had other probable means of avoiding the danger.Â  If the defendant provokes or initiates the assault, he cannot invoke self-defense; however, he may restore his right to self-defense if he withdraws from the conflict and communicates that decision to his adversary.Â  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 345, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999).Â  Because Santiago was not on his property, he had a duty to retreat.Â  See Fuller, 297 S.C. at 444, 377 S.E.2d at 331.Â  Taken in the light most favorable to Santiago, the record indicates that when Wisn was shot, Santiago stood at the back of his car and Wisn stood in the front. Â Due to the distance between the two men at the time of the shooting, Santiago could have retreated with the shotgun rather than shooting Wisn.Â  Moreover, Santiago simply could have avoided the danger by closing his trunk.Â  See Bryant, 336 S.C. at 345, 520 S.E.2d at 322 (stating appellant easily could have avoided the conflict by leaving the open parking lot where the situation arose).Â  Further, because Wisn was unarmed, Santiago had multiple opportunities to escape his perceived peril without resorting to firing his weapon, let alone firing it four times.Â  Therefore, no question of fact for the jury is created on this prong of self-defense.Â  \r\nBecause the record demonstrates as a matter of law the absence of at least one element of self-defense, the trial judge did not err in refusing to charge self-defense.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Dr. Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s TestimonyÂ  \r\nSantiago next argues the trial judge erred in refusing to allow Schwartz-Watts to testify that because of Santiagoâ€™s aspergerâ€™s disorder he did not have the requisite mental state to commit murder nor the ability to provide a voluntary confession.Â  Santiago attempted to call Schwartz-Watts as a witness during his case, but the trial judge refused to allow the testimony.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002); State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 566, 598 S.E.2d 279, 285 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  Id.Â  For an error to warrant reversal, however, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  Id.Â  Evidence is relevant if it has â€œany tendency to make[] the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  An expert witness qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify to assist the jury in understanding the evidence or determining an issue before them.Â  Rule 702, SCRE.Â Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Santiagoâ€™s Mental State During the Commission of the Crime\r\nOn appeal, Santiago argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow the testimony of Schwartz-Watts because the evidence was relevant to Santiagoâ€™s mental state, both at the time he made the statement to police and at the time of the shooting.Â  At trial, defense counsel offered Schwartz-Watts as an expert witness to testify that Santiagoâ€™s aspergerâ€™s disorder caused him to fear for his life, and accordingly, Santiago did not have the requisite mental state to commit murder.Â  Essentially, defense counsel argued that Santiago was culpable of a lesser offense because of his diminished capacity.Â  However, the diminished capacity defense is not recognized in South Carolina.Â  Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 220, 552 S.E.2d 26, 32 (2001).Â  In Gill, defense counsel wanted a forensic psychiatrist to testify that because Gill had a low IQ, he did not have the requisite mental state to commit murder.Â  The supreme court held the trial judge properly excluded this testimony because South Carolina does not recognize the diminished capacity defense.Â  Thus, the trial judge did not commit an abuse of discretion when she refused to allow Schwartz-Watts to testify regarding Santiagoâ€™s diminished capacity. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Voluntariness of Santiagoâ€™s Statements to Police\r\nSantiago also argues that Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony was relevant to his mental state at the time he made the statement to the police.Â Â  Initially, we question whether this issue is preserved for our review.\r\nAs a general rule, if an issue was not raised and ruled upon below, it will not be considered for the first time on appeal.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003); State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 584, 611 S.E.2d 273, 281 (Ct. App. 2005). Our courts have â€œconsistently refused to apply the plain error rule.â€Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997) (citations omitted).Â  Instead, â€œit is the responsibility of counsel to preserve issues for appellate review.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge, and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have been.Â  State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 20, 206 S.E.2d 705, 708 (1974); State v. King, 367 S.C. 131, 136, 623 S.E.2d 865, 868 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nHere, the trial court conducted a Jackson v. Denno[5] hearing prior to trial.Â  In that hearing, Santiago challenged the voluntariness of the statements made shortly after the shooting; however, at no point in the hearing did Santiago offer the testimony of Schwartz-Watts on the issue of how his aspergerâ€™s syndrome affected the voluntariness of his statement.Â  As the trial proceeded, Santiago sought to introduce the testimony of Schwartz-Watts prior to his own testimony.Â  The trial judge stated such testimony would be premature until after Santiago testified if he chose to do so.Â  However, the trial judge stated: â€œIt is my understanding, based on the information I have had the benefit of in chambers, that counsel would have intended to call Dr. Schwartz-Watts for the purpose of describing or explaining Mr. Santiagoâ€™s mode of communications, mode of testifying, why he projects himself as he does.â€Â  Neither prior to nor in response to this statement by the court, did Santiago raise the issue of how Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony would impact the voluntariness of his confession. Â \r\nAfter Santiago testified, the trial judge found the testimony of Schwartz-Watts was inadmissible but allowed Santiagoâ€™s counsel to proffer his arguments for the record.Â  Counsel for Santiago stated three reasons for Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony:\r\n\r\nMy intent, originally, for calling her was . . . while [Santiago] is ordinary and reasonable, he has this developmental disorder . . . that effects his individual perception.\r\n. . . \r\nMy second aspect of calling Dr. Schwartz-Watts would be to comment on his mental state as per it would relate to provocation and heat of passion under a charge for voluntary manslaughter.\r\n. . . \r\nThe third and final proffer would be for her to explain [Santiagoâ€™s] affect and appearance in court and dealing with his issuing a statement as he did based on his perceptions of his not being treated well, being messed with, his rights being violated, et cetera, et cetera.Â  Thatâ€™s the entire proffer for the record.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the proffer that Schwartz-Watts would have testified as to Santiagoâ€™s mental capacity, his perceptions at the shooting, his in-court demeanor, and his mental state as it relates to voluntary manslaughter.Â  Although defense counsel mentioned Santiagoâ€™s â€œissuing a statement as he did,â€ counsel never argued Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony would be relevant to the juryâ€™s determination of whether Santiagoâ€™s confession was voluntary.Â  Santiago only sought to introduce Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony on issues related to mental capacity, not on the issue of voluntariness, and the trial court never ruled on the admissibility of Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony on the issue of voluntariness.Â  Therefore, the issue is arguably not preserved for our review.\r\nMoreover, even if the issue was preserved for our review, we find any error in failing to allow Schwartz-Watts to testify to be harmless.Â  See State v. Miller, 367 S.C. 329, 332, 626 S.E.2d 328, 332 (2006) (explaining that an error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial).Â  Even without Santiagoâ€™s written confession, there is overwhelming evidence of Santiagoâ€™s guilt. Shortly after the shooting, Santiago turned himself in at the fire station where he told the firemen present that he just shot someone on Hilton Head, and that the weapon used in the shooting was in his car.Â  Furthermore, Santiago testified at trial that he shot Wisn on the day in question.Â  This is not a case where the perpetratorâ€™s identity is at issue or where Santiagoâ€™s confession was a pivotal piece of evidence against him.Â  Â Â Therefore, even if the trial judge erred in declining to allow Â Schwartz-Watts to testify about how Santiagoâ€™s syndrome affected the voluntariness of his statement, the error was harmless given the overwhelming evidence of Santiagoâ€™s guilt.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, Santiagoâ€™s conviction is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting in a separate opinion):Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE.Â  \r\nI.Â  Self-Defense\r\nI agree with Santiago that the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  The evidence supports a self-defense charge.Â Â Â  \r\nTo establish self-defense, a defendant must show: (1) he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) he actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonable, prudent person of ordinary fitness and courage would have entertained the same belief; and (4) the defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury other than to act as he did.Â  Jackson v.

Slater, 360 S.C. 487, 491, 602 S.E.2d 90, 91 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nDepending on the circumstances, words accompanied by hostile acts may establish self-defense.Â  Fuller, 297 S.C. at 444, 377 S.E.2d at 331; State v. Harvey, 220 S.C. 506, 518, 68 S.E.2d 409, 414 (1951), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (abrogating the doctrine of in favorem vitae); State v. Mason, 115 S.C. 214, 217, 105 S.E. 286, 286 (1920) (â€œWords accompanied by hostile acts may, according to the circumstances, not only reduce a killing from murder to manslaughter, but may establish the plea of self-defense.â€).Â  The defendant does not have to wait until his adversary is on equal footing in order to act; â€œhe has the right to act under the law of self-preservation and prevent his [adversary from] getting the drop on him.â€Â  State v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 322, 531 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2000); Hendrix, 270 S.C. at 660, 244 S.E.2d at 507; State v. Rash, 182 S.C. 42, 50, 188 S.E. 435, 438 (1936). \r\nIf the defendant provokes or initiates the assault, he cannot invoke self-defense; however, he may restore his right to self-defense if he withdraws from the conflict and communicates that decision to his adversary.Â  Slater, 360 S.C. at 491, 602 S.E.2d at 92-93.Â  Firing multiple shots does not necessarily negate self-defense so long as the defendant is justified in â€œcontinuing to shoot until it is apparent that the danger to his life and body has ceased.â€Â  Hendrix, 270 S.C. at 661, 244 S.E.2d at 507 (holding self-defense was established even though defendant fired four times in rapid succession).Â  Furthermore, the unlawful possession of a firearm does not automatically bar a self-defense charge.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â Â  \r\nIf a self-defense charge is warranted, the trial court should consider the facts and circumstances of the case and fashion an appropriate charge.Â  Starnes, 340 S.C. at 322, 531 S.E.2d at 913; Fuller, 297 S.C. at 443, 377 S.E.2d at 330.Â  â€œA self-defense charge is erroneous where the trial court fails to charge on elements of the defense which were applicable to the issues raised by the defendant.â€Â  Day, 341 S.C. at 418, 535 S.E.2d at 435.\r\nSeveral South Carolina appellate cases are instructive on when evidence is sufficient to require a charge on self-defense.Â  In State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 433 S.E.2d 848 (1993), Veronica Hill was present outside a nightclub when a fight broke out.Â  One of the fighters gave Hill a handgun, which she fired in the air when the fight escalated.Â  â€œThe victim, a spectator to the fight, jumped Hill from behind and began wrestling for the weapon.Â  The scuffle ended when Hill and victim turned face to face and the gun fired.â€Â  315 S.C. at 261, 433 S.E.2d at 848-49.Â  The trial judge refused to charge on self-defense, and the jury convicted Hill of voluntary manslaughter.Â  The supreme court held there was evidence to support a self-defense charge and reversed:\r\n\r\nThe relevant question for the Court to answer is whether there is any evidence in the record which would support a self-defense charge.Â  The record shows that Hill fired the gun into the air when several of her friends began fighting, and that the shot was fired to stop the fighting.Â  It was this gunshot which prompted the victim to attempt taking the gun away from Hill.Â  The victim, a larger person than Hill, came up behind Hill and grabbed her by â€œthe throat.â€Â  There was also evidence to support the proposition that after a violent struggle, the victim â€œlost her gripâ€ on the gun and was shot.\r\nThis evidence shows that Hill may not have been responsible for bringing about the difficulty which resulted in the victimâ€™s death.Â  Further, the record supports the conclusion that the struggle alone was some evidence that Hill was in fear or imminent danger of losing her life or sustaining serious bodily injury.Â  The method of victimâ€™s attack from behind is evidence that Hill was attempting to retreat, and that Hill had no means of avoiding the danger.Â  The size differential between Hill and the victim is evidence which would allow a reasonably-prudent individual of ordinary firmness and courage to entertain the same belief about the danger.\r\n\r\n In reviewing the record, it appears that there was ample evidence to support a self-defense charge to the jury.Â  Therefore, the trial judge erred in not granting Hillâ€™s request to charge self-defense to the jury.\r\n\r\nHill, 315 S.C. at 262-63, 433 S.E.2d at 849.\r\nState v. Bruno, 322 S.C. 534, 473 S.E.2d 450 (1996), involved a trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge on self-defense.Â  A jury convicted Bruno of murder for shooting the victim, James Murphy.Â  Bruno argued the trial court erred by refusing his additional charge on self-defense: that he had no duty to retreat if retreating would place him in danger.Â  The supreme court, however, found that Bruno was not entitled to a charge on self-defense at all.\r\n\r\nBruno was not entitled to a self-defense charge, because he presented no evidence that he believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury.Â  On direct examination, his only testimony was that he felt Victim was coming at him with something.Â  He testified, â€œIt happened so quick, you know.Â  I didnâ€™t mean to kill him.Â  I just wanted him to keep away from me.â€Â  Furthermore, when asked what was his intention in firing the weapon, Bruno responded, â€œJust let him know to try to stay away from me and not mess with me.â€Â  On cross-examination, Bruno stated that Victim was â€œgetting in his trunk and he came towards me and something snapped and I shot him.â€\r\nSince Bruno presented no evidence . . . that he believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, he fails the second element of self-defense.Â  See State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 440 S.E.2d 370 (1994).Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge no duty to retreat was not in error as Bruno was not entitled to a self-defense charge.\r\n\r\nBruno, 322 S.C. at 536-37, 473 S.E.2d at 452 (footnote omitted).\r\nThe supreme court, in State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 520 S.E.2d 319 (1999), affirmed the trial courtâ€™s refusal to give the jury a self-defense instruction.Â  Lavar Bryant admitted to killing the victim, but gave several conflicting statements of the events.Â  The victim, a DHEC employee, approached Bryant in the DHEC parking lot as Bryant was breaking into the victimâ€™s car.Â  Bryant had a knife, but dropped it and instead stabbed the victim several times with a screwdriver.Â  The Bryant court found a self-defense charge was properly declined.\r\n\r\nAppellantâ€™s statements fail to establish the elements of self-defense entitling appellant to a self-defense charge.Â  No question of fact for the jury is created on this issue.Â  Appellant concedes he brought on the initial difficulty by breaking into Suberâ€™s vehicle.Â  Even if appellant subjectively meant to withdraw from the conflict he failed to communicate this intent to Suber.Â  Although in one statement appellant claimed he dropped the knife because he did not want to fight, appellant admitted Suber did not see him drop the knife.Â  Thus, Suber was unaware of appellantâ€™s intent to withdraw from the conflict.Â  Further, appellant never told Suber he was leaving and did not want to fight.Â  If appellant truly intended to withdraw he could have easily left the open parking lot.Â  See Macias v. State, 36 Ariz. 140, 283 P. 711 (1929) (a man who is a trespasser and in a place where he has no right to be may not stand his ground and slay his assailant and still claim self-defense, when by leaving such place he might avoid the conflict).Â  Because appellant failed to effectively communicate to Suber his intent to withdraw from the conflict, appellantâ€™s right to use self-defense was never restored.Â  Appellant, as the aggressor, remained responsible for bringing on the difficulty.\r\n\r\nBryant, 336 S.C. at 345-46, 520 S.E.2d at 322.\r\nIn State v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 535 S.E.2d 431 (2000), the supreme court reversed Raymond Dayâ€™s murder conviction for, among other reasons, the trial courtâ€™s failure to charge self-defense.Â  The victim, Wayne Renew, had hired Day to kill Renewâ€™s ex-girlfriend, Debra Bouchillon.Â  Day was to murder Bouchillon and meet Renew on a dirt road after the killing.Â  However, Day, who previously had been romantically involved with Bouchillon, had a change of heart.Â  He did go to Bouchillonâ€™s home, but he informed her of the conspiracy and made an anonymous phone call to the police regarding the plot.Â  Day and Bouchillon decided to meet Renew on the dirt road so that Renew would believe Day had gone through with the murder.Â  Bouchillon rode along, but hid in the back seat of the car under several blankets.Â  Day informed Renew he had killed Bouchillon.Â  The two returned to their cars and drove away.Â  Day followed Renew, and Renew stopped his car and motioned to Day.Â  At this point \r\n\r\nDay became frightened because he thought Renew had figured out he had been duped.Â  According to Day,\r\n  \r\nI was talking to Wayne listening to what he said and looking, and then I just caught it out of the corner of my eye, the blankets coming up and came up and went down real quick and I saw Mr. Renew reach for a gun . . . and I saw Mr. Renew go like this (indicating). And by the time he had come up, I had shot him. I really thought he had a gun. I re-live that moment every day. \r\n  \r\n\r\nDay, 341 S.C. at 415, 535 S.E.2d at 433.Â  The trial judge refused to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  However, the jury inquired about self-defense law, and in response, the judge gave a self-defense instruction. \r\nThe supreme court ruled the initial refusal to charge on self-defense was error.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œIf there is any evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant acted in self-defense, the defendant is entitled to instructions on the defense, and the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to do so is reversible error.â€Â  State v. Muller, 282 S.C. 10, 316 S.E.2d 409 (1984).Â  There is sufficient evidence in the instant case to support a charge on self-defense.Â  Day testified he believed he was in imminent danger because he thought Renew was going to pull a gun on him.Â Â  Day gave the following testimony about the fatal incident:\r\n  \r\nI pulled in and turned around and pulled in front of him [Renew] and I walked to the truck and he said something and I said something and he pulled a gun on me. I pulled Debbieâ€™s gun out and shot him in the head the first shot and I donâ€™t know where the last stuff, the first shot went. \r\n  \r\n\r\n According to Dayâ€™s theory, Renew was a violent drug abuser who had a history of violence against him and others.Â  Day knew that Renew had a tendency to violently overreact, and when he thought Renew saw Bouchillon move under the blankets, he believed he was in imminent danger and shot Renew to defend himself.\r\nDay presented an evidence based theory as to what occurred that evening.Â  Although some of the evidence was disputed, there was certainly enough evidence in this case to make self-defense a jury question.Â  Defense counsel felt so strongly about the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a self-defense instruction that she moved for a mistrial.Â  She convincingly argued that the trial judge cast aside Dayâ€™s entire defense and removed it from the juryâ€™s consideration.\r\n. . . .\r\n Day argues the trial judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury that Day did not have the burden of proving self-defense, and that the jury could consider past difficulties between the parties in weighing self-defense.Â  We agree.\r\n The trial judge initially refused to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  However, the jury inquired about the South Carolina law on self defense.Â  The jury wrote: â€œWhat does the State of South Carolina have to say when a person can defend themself [sic] with the use of deadly force.Â  May we see a copy of the law concerning this?â€Â  In response, the trial judge charged the jury a standard self-defense instruction as outlined by this Court in State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 317 S.E.2d 452 (1984) along with a specific charge on the right to act on appearances and the duty to retreat.Â  The trial judge did not include in his instruction Dayâ€™s Request to Charge Number One (factors that would give Day the right to judge Renewâ€™s conduct more harshly, including age difference, substance abuse, â€œbad bloodâ€, prior threats, and reputation for violence); Number Two (prior acts of violence and prior difficulties between Day and Renew); and Number Eight (the Stateâ€™s burden of proof when a defendant asserts self-defense).\r\n\r\n The trial judgeâ€™s failure to charge on the specific elements of self-defense that were applicable to Dayâ€™s theory constitutes reversible error.Â  As we held in Fuller, a trial judge should specifically tailor the self-defense instruction to adequately reflect the facts and theories presented by the defendant.Â  State v. Fuller, 297 S.C. 440, 377 S.E.2d 328 (1989).Â  A self-defense charge is erroneous where the trial court fails to charge on elements of the defense which were applicable to the issues raised by the defendant.Â  Id.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s instruction in this case was incomplete.Â  It should have included a charge indicating: (1) Day had a right to judge the conduct of Renew more harshly than otherwise because of Renewâ€™s drug consumption (Defendantâ€™s Request to Charge Number 1); and (2) the jury could consider prior instances of violence or unprovoked aggression by Renew in determining whether Day had a reasonable belief of imminent danger (Defendantâ€™s Request to Charge Number 2).Â  Central to Dayâ€™s defense was his argument that Renew had previously pulled a gun on him and that Renew was in a drug-induced paranoia the day of the incident.Â  The jury charge was, therefore, incomplete because the trial judge failed to charge on Renewâ€™s substance abuse or his prior acts of violence. \r\n  The trial judgeâ€™s â€œafter-the-factâ€ self-defense instruction was inadequate because defense counsel was unable to present a complete defense during her summation.Â  In her closing argument, defense counsel could not assert self-defense, even though that was Dayâ€™s theory, because she knew the trial judge was not going to adequately charge the jury.Â  Instead, she was forced to present the facts so they implied self-defense, without actually saying the word.Â  For example, in her closing defense counsel states: \r\n  \r\n\r\n  [Day] knew Wayne to be a violent person who would immediately take action against someone who had double-crossed him. . . . [H]e told you he saw Wayneâ€™s hands come down and he shot him. . . .Â  Raymond Day honestly believed that he was reaching for a gun.Â  Raymond knew that Wayne carried a gun.Â  He knew Wayne carried the gun stuck in the waistband of his pants or under the seat and he just seen Debbieâ€™s head pop up, he knew he had double-crossed Wayne Renew and he did what he had to do.Â  He honestly believed that was the only course of action he could take and he pulled the gun out from his waistband where he held it and he had to shoot Wayne Renew.\r\n  \r\n Defense counsel attempted to make a case for self-defense but was restricted because she knew the jury was not going to be so charged. Â The trial judge belatedly recognized that a self-defense charge was necessary.Â  Providing an â€œafter-the-factâ€ instruction was inadequate because the prejudice to Day was incurable.Â  Day was unable to adequately assert a complete defense during the trial, and the jury was left with the impression that the trial judge did not think the law of self-defense was applicable to the case.\r\n\r\nDay, 341 S.C. at 416-19, 535 S.E.2d at 434-36 (alterations in original) (footnote omitted).\r\nIn State v. Slater, 360 S.C. 487, 602 S.E.2d 90 (Ct. App. 2004), a divided court of appeals reversed the trial judgeâ€™s failure to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  Slater explained that following a school dance, he noticed a disturbance in a nearby parking lot.Â  Slater and several friends went to the parking lot to investigate and discovered a robbery transpiring.Â  Five men were kicking the victim as he lay on the ground.Â  The court summarized Slaterâ€™s testimony as follows:\r\n\r\nSlater testified that he walked up to the robbery and surprised one of the attackers.Â  The man then turned around and pointed a gun toward Slater.Â  Slater quickly turned around and started running back toward his car.Â  As he ran, he heard a gunshot and responded by shooting his own gun behind him.Â  Slater got into the car where his friends were waiting for him.Â  He continued shooting in the air as the car pulled away.Â  In the ensuing chaos, the victim of the attempted robbery lay dying on the ground.Â  He had been shot twice.\r\n\r\n360 S.C. at 489, 602 S.E.2d at 92 (footnote omitted).Â  The trial judge refused to charge the jury on self-defense.Â  We held this was error:\r\n\r\nHere, there was some evidence to support a self-defense charge.Â  Slater maintains that when he approached the altercation between the victim and his attackers, an attacker pointed a gun at Slater.Â  Slater then turned and ran.Â  While running away, Slater heard gunshots and returned fire, not looking in the direction where he was firing.Â  Slater testified, â€œwhen I walked up on him, I guess I surprised him and he turned to me and he had a gun in his hand.Â  And I see his gun and I started running.â€Â  He added, â€œYeah, when I walked up on him like here, like he turned to me, like had the gun pointed at me like he surprised.â€Â  Additionally, Mark Nelson, a friend of the victim, testified that he saw one of the attackersâ€”someone other than Slaterâ€”with a gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n  360 S.C. at 491, 602 S.E.2d at 93.Â  Accordingly, we reversed.\r\nState v. Light, 363 S.C. 325, 610 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2005), involved the appeal of Michael Light who was convicted for murdering his girlfriend, Priscilla Davis.Â  Light admitted to shooting Davis but claimed that Davis first threatened him with the gun: â€œShe was pointing [the rifle] at me and screaming and hollering and accusing me as usual . . . . I was afraid she was going to shoot me.â€Â  Light averred:\r\n\r\nThe only thing I remember, I did tryâ€”I took my left hand to knock it away, try to push it away from me.Â  Than [sic] after I jerked it away from her, I did stumble back several feet, you know after jerking it.Â  The weapon discharged but it was not intentionally. \r\n. . . .\r\nQ.Â  Did she back away from you?Â  Did you back away from her?\r\nA.Â  I went back from her after we was tussling with the rifle. \r\n\r\nLight, 363 S.C. at 329, 610 S.E.2d at 506 (alteration in original).\r\nThe trial judge charged the jury on murder, voluntary manslaughter, and accident.Â  Light appealed, maintaining the court erred in denying his request for a charge on self-defense.Â  We disagreed:\r\n\r\nAlthough Light vacillates in his various accounts, he stated he had disarmed Davis and taken possession of the rifle when the shot was fired.Â  Under those facts, Davis, then unarmed, no longer posed a threat to the armed Light and he could not have reasonably believed she did.Â  Therefore, the evidence demonstrates he did not have the right to use deadly force in self-defense and the trial court properly refused to so charge the jury.\r\n\r\nLight, 363 S.C. at 333, 610 S.E.2d at 508.\r\nA review of the foregoing precedent demonstrates the trial judge should have charged the jury on self-defense.Â  The standard for giving a self-defense charge is critical in this case.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial determines the law to be charged.Â  State v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004); State v. Light, 363 S.C. 325, 330, 610 S.E.2d 504, 506 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 624 S.E.2d 443 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, if there is any evidence to support a jury charge, the trial judge should grant the requested charge.Â  Burriss, 334 S.C. at 262, 513 S.E.2d at 108.Â  â€œIf there is any evidence in the record to support self-defense, the issue should be submitted to the jury.â€Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 260, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002) (emphasis added); accord Day, 341 S.C. at 416, 535 S.E.2d at 434; Burriss, 334 S.C. at 262, 513 S.E.2d at 108 (1999); Hill, 315 S.C. at 261, 433 S.E.2d at 849; State v. Muller, 282 S.C. 10, 10, 316 S.E.2d 409, 409 (1984); cf. Goodson, 312 S.C. at 280, 440 S.E.2d at 372 (noting a self-defense charge is not required unless the evidence supports it).\r\n\r\nIn general, the trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when read as a whole.Â  The substance of the law must be charged to the jury, not particular verbiage.Â  Current law requires the State to disprove self-defense, once raised by the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Finally, to warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.\r\n\r\nBurkhart, 350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 302-03 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Â The trial court commits reversible error if it fails to give a charge on an issue raised by the evidence and requested by the defendant.Â  Hill, 315 S.C. at 262, 433 S.E.2d at 849; State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380 S.E.2d 834, 836 (1989).Â  â€œIf there is any evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant acted in self-defense, the defendant is entitled to instructions on the defense, and the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to do so is reversible error.â€Â  Day, 341 S.C. at 416-17, 535 S.E.2d at 434 (citing State v. Muller, 282 S.C. 10, 316 S.E.2d 409 (1984)).\r\nFirst, there is evidence that Santiago was not at fault in bringing about the difficulty.Â  The trial judge stated that â€œthe only difficulty that existedâ€”the defendant has testified regarding the only difficulty was that Mr. Wisn was swearing at him, wasnâ€™t threatening.Â  Just said, stay away from my daughter; stay away from my house.â€Â  I disagree with the courtâ€™s characterization of the evidence.Â  Santiago and Wisn went into the house to search for Santiagoâ€™s belt, but the encounter soon deteriorated with Wisn yelling at Santiago: â€œAnd he walked down the steps down in the driveway with me but the whole time heâ€™sâ€”itâ€™s like screaming andâ€”at my back, donâ€™tâ€”you know, donâ€™t ever come on my fucking property again and stay the fuck away from my daughter.â€Â  According to Santiago, â€œI didnâ€™t even stop to pick up my stuff.Â  Because I ainâ€™t even gonna stop with that dude behind me.â€Â  However, Wisn picked up Santiagoâ€™s belongings, walked to the back of Santiagoâ€™s car, and â€œthrew the plastic container in the trunk.Â  And then he threw in the garden hose in the trunk.Â  All the while heâ€™s still cursing at me.â€Â  Wisn then spotted the shotgun.Â  According to Santiago, Wisn â€œlooked over at my gun, and then he looked back at me.Â  And then he looked at the gun again and stopped.â€Â  Santiago snatched up the shotgun and began backing away, but Wisn pursued him: â€œ[H]e turned towards me and said, â€˜Donâ€™t be fucking stupid,â€™ like that, like he was gonna grab it.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  On cross-examination, Santiago explained, â€œ[H]e said, â€˜Donâ€™t be fucking stupid.â€™Â  And he didnâ€™t say to like protect me from myself.Â  He said it as an insult and he was coming fromâ€”with his hands in the thing [sic] towards me and stepping towards me at the same time.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  Thus, in addition to the hostile words, Wisn threw Santiagoâ€™s things into his trunk and eyed the gun.Â  The fact that Santiago picked up the gun does not negate his self-defense claim because a defendant â€œhas the right to act under the law of self-preservation and prevent his [adversary from] getting the drop on him.â€Â  Starnes, 340 S.C. at 322, 531 S.E.2d at 913.Â  It would be absurd for the law to require Santiago to wait for Wisn, a man twice Santiagoâ€™s size, to grab for the gun before Santiago could reach for it.Â  Most importantly, as Santiago stepped away, Wisn advanced towards him, reaching for the gun.Â  Santiagoâ€™s version of the events sufficiently establishes some evidence that Santiago was not at fault in bringing about the difficulty.Â  \r\nSecond, Santiago believed he was in imminent danger.Â  On direct examination, counsel asked, â€œWhat was going through your mind at the timeâ€ of the shooting.Â  Santiago replied, â€œI did not want to be killed.Â  And I didnâ€™t want to be killed by my own gun.Â  And this dude is twice as big as me and if he grabbed it, thereâ€™s no way I could wrestle it away from him.â€Â  The circuit judge apparently found that Santiago actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury when he picked up the gun, but found that â€œclearly at the point in time that he has the gun and he has backed away from Mr. Wisn, then he is no longer, can no longer be in imminent danger.â€Â  This was error.Â  The question is whether Santiago continued to believe he was in imminent danger between the time he picked up the gun and the time he shot Wisn.Â  According to Santiago, that window of time lasted a â€œsecond,â€ and during that short span of time Wisn was advancing towards Santiago.Â  Santiagoâ€™s testimony constitutes evidence he actually believed he was in imminent danger when he shot Wisn.\r\nThird, the trial judge opined, â€œI do not believe thereâ€™s evidence in this record that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would entertain the same beliefâ€ of imminent danger.Â  However, there is evidence that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the belief he was in imminent danger.Â  In Hill, our supreme court stated that â€œsize differential between [the defendant] and the victim is evidence which would allow a reasonably-prudent individual of ordinary firmness and courage to entertain the same belief about the danger.â€Â  315 S.C. at 262, 433 S.E.2d at 849.Â  The State did not dispute Santiagoâ€™s testimony that Wisn was â€œtwice as bigâ€ as Santiago.Â  Additionally, the harsh way in which Wisn spoke to Santiago, coupled with Wisnâ€™s acts of following Santiago to his car, throwing his belongings into the trunk, and stepping toward him is evidence that a reasonably prudent person would entertain a fear of imminent danger.Â  The trial judge did not state any specific reasons why she believed Santiagoâ€™s fear was unreasonable under the reasonably prudent person standard.Â  \r\nFinally, Santiago had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.Â  Santiago left the house, but Wisn followed him.Â  The judge concluded that once Santiago had the gun, he â€œwas exercising a means of avoiding the danger, which means at that point there could be no justification in even proceeding to shoot Mr. Wisn four times.â€Â  This conclusion, however, ignores Santiagoâ€™s testimony that Wisn continued to come toward him.Â  Santiago attempted to retreat up the point where Wisn was about to come into physical contact with him.Â  These facts make the instant case distinguishable from Light.Â  In Light, the defendant wrestled a gun away from his girlfriend and testified that after he obtained control of the gun he stumbled back â€œseveral feetâ€ when the gun accidentally discharged.Â  363 S.C. at 329, 610 S.E.2d at 506.Â  The court concluded that once Light had disarmed the victim, she â€œno longer posed a threat to the armed Light and he could not have reasonably believed she did.â€Â  Id. at 333, 610 S.E.2d at 508.Â  Significantly, Light did not claim that he shot the victim as she was advancing toward him, but maintained that the shooting was accidental.Â  Thus, there was no evidence in Light that the victim posed a threat of imminent harm to Light at the moment she was shot. Â Here, Wisn was allegedly advancing toward Santiago when Santiago shot him.Â  The evidence suggests that Santiago reached the point of retreat where he had to discharge the gun or be overpowered by Wisn.Â  \r\nFor the purposes of determining whether a charge on the law of self-defense is warranted, Santiagoâ€™s credibility is not relevant.Â  The court should look only to whether any evidence exists to support the charge.Â  Where, as here, the defense introduces some evidence to support the charge, it is the juryâ€™s responsibility to determine whether the defendantâ€™s account of the events is believable and whether his actions were truly in self-defense.Â  In the case sub judice, the trial judge committed reversible error by invading the province of the jury and failing to give a self-defense charge.Â  The failure to charge is patently prejudicial and is reversible error as a jury could have found Santiago was justified in killing Wisn.Â  See Day, 341 S.C. at 416-17, 535 S.E.2d at 434 (â€œIf there is any evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant acted in self-defense, the defendant is entitled to instructions on the defense, and the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to do so is reversible error.â€). \r\nII.Â  Relevance of Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s Testimony\r\nI agree with the majority that the trial judge correctly excluded the testimony as to Santiagoâ€™s mental state during the commission of the crime.Â  However, the trial judge incorrectly excluded Dr. Schwartz-Wattâ€™s testimony as to the voluntariness of Santiagoâ€™s confession. \r\nA.Â  Diminished Capacity\r\nSchwartz-Watts would have opined that Aspergerâ€™s Disorder caused Santiago to fear for his life and that consequently, he did not have the requisite mental state to commit murder.Â  However, the diminished capacity defense is not recognized in South Carolina.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 17-24-10 (2003) provides an affirmative defense if, â€œat the time of the commission of the act constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked the capacity to distinguish moral or legal right from moral or legal wrong or to recognize the particular act charged as morally or legally wrong.â€Â  In addition to an insanity defense, certain jurisdictions acknowledge what Professor LaFave calls â€œpartial responsibilityâ€â€”a doctrine applicable to a defendant who\r\n\r\nmay have been suffering from an abnormal mental condition which was not of a kind or character to afford him a successful insanity defense under the right-wrong test or other standard applicable in that jurisdiction.Â  But, while this defendant is therefore ineligible for a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, his mental abnormality may nonetheless be a most relevant consideration in the determination of whether he is guilty of the crime charged.\r\n\r\nWayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law Â§ 9.2.Â  Our courts, however, have clearly rejected application of the concept.Â  \r\nIn Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 552 S.E.2d 26 (2001), a forensic psychiatrist, Morgan, testified that Gill had a borderline intellectual capacity and possessed an antisocial personality.Â  Dr. Morgan asseverated Gill could not formulate malice aforethought.Â  Gill requested a charge on diminished capacity, which the trial judge refused.Â  The supreme court held diminished capacity is not recognized in South Carolina:\r\n\r\nThe diminished capacity doctrine allows a defendant to offer evidence of his mental condition with respect to his capacity to achieve the mens rea required for the commission of the offense charged.Â  21 Am.Jur.2d Criminal Law Â§ 38 (1998).Â  In particular, the defense may be invoked to negate specific intent, where such intent is an element of the offense charged.Â  Id.Â  Diminished capacity differs from the insanity defense in that it may be raised by a defendant who has conceded to be legally sane.Â  Id.\r\n The trial judge did not err by refusing to charge diminished capacity because it is not recognized in South Carolina.Â  Furthermore, according to this Court in State v. Fuller, 229 S.C. 439, 93 S.E.2d 463 (1956), a defendant is not entitled to an instruction concerning his capacity to form the requisite intent for malice aforethought when the instructions, taken as a whole, properly present elements of malice.Â  Gill received proper jury charges on murder, voluntary manslaughter, ABIK, insanity, and self defense.Â  These jury charges, taken as a whole, were sufficient because they adequately presented the elements of malice as recognized by South Carolina law.\r\n\r\nGill, 346 S.C. at 220, 552 S.E.2d at 32.\r\n Schwartz-Watts sought to establish that due to Santiagoâ€™s Aspergerâ€™s Disorder, he did not have possess the mental state required for murderâ€”in other words, that Santiago suffered from a diminished mental capacity.Â  The trial judge did not abuse her discretion by refusing to allow this testimony.Â  \r\nB.Â  Voluntariness of Santiagoâ€™s Confession to Police\r\n1.Â  Proffer of the Expertâ€™s Testimony\r\nThe defense requested that the court allow Schwartz-Watts to testify as to her opinion that Santiagoâ€™s Aspergerâ€™s Disorder rendered his confession involuntarily.Â  Specifically, counsel stated,\r\n\r\nThe third and final proffer would be for her [explanation of] Chrisâ€™ affect and appearance in court and his dealing with his issuing a statement as he did based on his perceptions of his not being treated well, being messed with, his rights violated, et cetera, et cetera.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel did not proffer Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony, but rather informed the trial judge of what her testimony would have been.Â  Generally, a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge, and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have been.Â  State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 20, 260 S.E.2d 705, 708 (1979); State v. Cox, 258 S.C. 114, 117, 187 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1972); State v. King, 367 S.C. 131, 623 S.E.2d 865 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Here, although defense counsel should have proffered Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony, I find the record adequately indicates what her testimony would have been.Â  Therefore, in my view, this issue is preserved for review.Â Â  \r\n2.Â  Admissibility of Confessions \r\nA confession is not admissible unless it was voluntarily made.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243, 471 S.E.2d 689, 694 (1996); State v. Compton, 366 S.C. 671, 680, 623 S.E.2d 661, 666 (Ct. App. 2005); see also State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 475, 385 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1989) (â€œThe test of admissibility of a statement is voluntariness.â€).Â  â€œAn accusedâ€™s involuntary statement is inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment.â€Â  State v. Victor, 300 S.C. 220, 223, 387 S.E.2d 248, 249 (1989); see also State v. Hook, 348 S.C. 401, 559 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 2001), affâ€™d as modified, 356 S.C. 421, 590 S.E.2d 25 (2003).Â  The voluntariness requirement is in addition to the intelligent waiver mandate of Miranda.Â  See State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 25, 339 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1986) (â€œIn order to secure the admission of a defendantâ€™s statement, the State must affirmatively show the statement was voluntary and taken in compliance with Miranda.â€) (citations omitted).Â  â€œIt is now axiomatic . . . that a defendant in a criminal case is deprived of due process of law if his conviction is founded, in whole or in part, upon an involuntary confession, without regard for the truth or falsity of the confession . . . even though there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction.â€Â  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376 (1964).\r\nThe requirement that only voluntary confessions be admitted is based on the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s right against self-incrimination, and was incorporated and made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  See Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 6 (1964) (â€œWe hold today that the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s exception from compulsory self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the States.â€).Â  In Hook, this Court explained:\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that no person â€œshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. V. This provision governs state as well as federal criminal proceedings.Â  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964).Â  Article 1, Section 12, of the South Carolina Constitution contains a similar provision.Â  S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 12 (â€œ. . . nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.â€).\r\nThe Fifth Amendment does not, of course, operate as a blanket prohibition against the taking of any and all statements made by criminal defendants to law enforcement officials.Â  Volunteered statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation or spontaneously offered up, are not barred by the Fifth Amendment.Â  State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 307, 479 S.E.2d 838, 844 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)).\r\n\r\nHook, 348 S.C. at 409-10, 559 S.E.2d at 860.Â  In Hook we observed that the â€œconcept that the privilege against self-incrimination encompasses the right to be free from being penalized for its exercise is well established.â€Â  Id. at 411, 559 S.E.2d at 861 (quoting Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801 (1977) (â€œ[W]hen a State compels testimony by threatening to inflict potent sanctions unless the constitutional privilege is surrendered, that testimony is obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment and cannot be used against the declarant in a subsequent criminal prosecution. . . . Similarly, our cases have established that a State may not impose substantial penalties because a witness elects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against himself.â€)).Â  The United States Supreme Court, in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), elucidated the rationales behind the prohibition against involuntary confessions:\r\n\r\nIt is now inescapably clear that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the use of involuntary confessions not only because of the probable unreliability of confessions that are obtained in a manner deemed coercive, but also because of the â€˜strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will,â€™ Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206-207, 80 S.Ct. 274, 280, 4 L.Ed.2d 242, and because of â€˜the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.â€™ Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 320-321, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 1205-1206, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265.Â  \r\n\r\nJackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. at 385-86.\r\n3.Â  Voluntariness Determinations\r\n The process for determining whether a statement is voluntary, and thus admissible, is bifurcated: it involves determinations by both the judge and the jury.Â  First, the trial judge must conduct an evidentiary hearing, outside the presence of the jury, where the State must show the confession was voluntarily made by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nUnder Jackson v. Denno, a defendant is entitled to a â€œreliable determination as to the voluntariness of his confession by a tribunal other than the jury charged with deciding his guilt or innocence.â€Â  State v. Fortner, 266 S.C. 223, 226, 222 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1976).Â  â€œA defendant in a criminal case is entitled to an independent evidentiary hearing to determine the voluntariness of statements made by the defendant prior to the submission of such statements to the jury.â€ State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 271, 498 S.E.2d 655, 666 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d as modified, 343 S.C. 520, 541 S.E.2d 247 (2001); see also State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 84, 441 S.E.2d 635, 639 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œWhenever evidence is introduced that was allegedly obtained by conduct violative of a defendantâ€™s constitutional rights, the defendant is entitled to have the trial judge conduct an evidentiary hearing outside of the presence of the jury at the threshold point to establish circumstances under which it was gained.â€).Â  â€œIn South Carolina, the judge makes this initial determination of voluntariness required by Jackson v. Denno[.]â€ Fortner, 266 S.C. at 226-27, 222 S.E.2d at 510.\r\nThe State bears the burden of showing the confession was voluntary.Â  Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 243, 471 S.E.2d at 695; Washington, 296 S.C. at 55, 370 S.E.2d at 612; State v. Neeley, 271 S.C. 33, 244 S.E.2d 522 (1978); see also Middleston, 288 S.C. at 24, 339 S.E.2d at 694 (â€œIn order to secure the admission of a defendantâ€™s statement, the State must affirmatively show the statement was voluntary and taken in compliance with Miranda.â€).\r\nIn State v. Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 370 S.E.2d 611 (1988), our supreme court addressed the standard of proof applicable to the Jackson v. Denno hearing:\r\n\r\nâ€œIt has been uniformly held, a confession may be introduced upon proof of its voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  State v. Smith, 268 S.C. 349, 354, 234 S.E.2d 19, 21 (1977) (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nâ€œ(T)he burden is on the State to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his rights were voluntarily waived.â€Â  State v. Neeley, 271 S.C. 33, 40, 244 S.E.2d 522, 526 (1978) (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nâ€œ(T)he prosecution must prove . . . by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession was voluntary.â€Â  Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S.Ct. 619, 627, 30 L.Ed.2d 618, 627 (1972) (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n    See also Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 515, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986); State v. Middleton, --- S.C. ---, 368 S.E.2d 457 (1988); In re Christopher W., 285 S.C. 329, 329 S.E.2d 769 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n\r\nWashington, 296 S.C. at 55, 370 S.E.2d 612.Â  Accord State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 479 S.E.2d 838 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDuring the Jackson v. Denno hearing, the trial judge must examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession and determine whether the State has carried its burden of showing the confession was voluntarily made.Â  State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 475, 385 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1989); State v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 708, 258 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1979) (citing Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973)).Â  \r\nOnce the trial judge determines that the confession is admissible, it is up to the jury to ultimately determine whether the confession was voluntarily made.Â  Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 243, 471 S.E.2d at 695; State v. Callahan, 263 S.C. 35, 41, 208 S.E.2d 284, 286 (1974) (â€œA confession is not admissible unless voluntary, and it [is] for the jury to say in the last analysis whether the confession [is] or [is] not voluntary.â€); State v. Clinkscales, 231 S.C. 650, 653, 99 S.E.2d 663, 664 (1957) (â€œAlthough all the evidence may be to the effect that a confession made while under arrest was a voluntary one, the jury may not be so convinced; and it is the jury who, in the final analysis, must determine the factual issue of voluntariness.â€); State v. Brown, 212 S.C. 237, 246, 47 S.E.2d 521, 525 (1948).Â  \r\n\r\nNothing in [Jackson v. Denno] questioned the province or capacity of juries to assess the truthfulness of confessions.Â  Nothing in that opinion took from the jury any evidence relating to the accuracy or weight of confessions admitted into evidence.Â  A defendant has been as free since Jackson as he was before to familiarize a jury with circumstances that attend the taking of his confession, including facts bearing upon its weight and voluntariness.\r\n\r\nLego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 485-86 (1972).Â  Thus, the jury is entitled to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession to determine whether the confession was voluntarily made.Â  State v. Vang, 353 S.C. 78, 84, 577 S.E.2d 225, 227-28 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\n\r\nConfessions, even those that have been found to be voluntary, are not conclusive of guilt. . . .Â  Indeed, stripped of the power to describe to the jury the circumstances that prompted his confession, the defendant is effectively disabled from answering the one question every rational juror needs answered: If the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?Â  Accordingly, regardless of whether the defendant marshaled the same evidence earlier in support of an unsuccessful motion to suppress, and entirely independent of any question of voluntariness, a defendantâ€™s case may stand or fall on his ability to convince the jury that the manner in which the confession was obtained casts doubt on its credibility. \r\n\r\nCrane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 689 (1986) (citations omitted).\r\n4.Â  Totality of the Circumstances Test\r\nThe test of voluntariness is â€œâ€˜whether a defendantâ€™s will was overborneâ€™ by the circumstances surrounding the given confession.Â  The due process test takes into consideration â€˜the totality of all the surrounding circumstancesâ€”both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.â€™â€Â  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 434 (2000) (citations omitted); State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 30, 538 S.E.2d 248, 253 (2000); State v. Linnen, 278 S.C. 175, 179, 293 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1982); State v.

Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 55-56, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988) (citing State v. Drayton, 287 S.C. 226, 337 S.E.2d 216 (1985); State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d 582 (1981)).\r\nCoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding a confession is not voluntary.Â  Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157 (1986); Linnen, 278 S.C. 175, 293 S.E.2d 851; Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 498 S.E.2d 655.Â  Coercion is determined from the perspective of the suspect.Â  Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292 (1990).Â  The Supreme Court, in Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680 (1993), set forth a non-exclusive list of factors which may be considered in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis:\r\n\r\nUnder the due process approach . . . courts look to the totality of circumstances to determine whether a confession was voluntary.Â Â  Those potential circumstances include not only the crucial element of police coercion, Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 521, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986); the length of the interrogation, Ashcraft v.

Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224; his lack of education, e.g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 78 S.Ct. 844, 2 L.Ed.2d 975; or his low intelligence, e.g., Fikes v.

North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737, 86 S.Ct. 1761, 16 L.Ed.2d 895; the length of detention, e.g., Chambers v. Florida, supra; the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning, e.g., Ashcraft v.

Cain, 246 S.C. 536, 144 S.E.2d 905 (1965), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (abrogating the doctrine of in favorem vitae), Hershel Cain was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.Â  The victim, who owned a grocery store and filling station, was found lying on the floor of his store, dead from a gunshot wound to the chest.Â  Police arrested Cain two days later and he confessed to the murder.Â  The officer who took Cainâ€™s statement testified to the facts surrounding the confession.Â  â€œ[A]t the time the confession was admitted in evidence, the sole testimony before the trial Judge was that such confession had been freely and voluntarily made by the appellant.Â  There was no testimony to the contrary.â€Â  246 S.C. at 539, 144 S.E.2d at 906.Â  However, prior to the shooting, a doctor diagnosed Cain with a mental conditionâ€”â€œschizophrenic reaction of the paranoid type.â€Â  Id.Â  Cain contended\r\n\r\nthat the court should have excluded from the evidence the statement or confession signed by the appellant because the appellant, at the time of the making of said confession, was a suspect, was under arrest, and was not provided with counsel; and that at the time of the making of said confession, the appellant was disoriented, having been a patient in the State Hospital prior to the alleged confession and again within five days after making such confession.\r\n\r\n246 S.C. at 541, 144 S.E.2d at 907.Â  The court found that the confession was admissible, but reversed Cainâ€™s convictions because the judge failed to charge the jury as to its role in determining the voluntariness of Cainâ€™s confession.\r\n\r\nAt the time the confession of the appellant was offered and admitted into evidence, even though the confession was taken while the appellant was in custody, all of the evidence showed that the said confession, as made, was a free and voluntary one, and there was no evidence to contradict the prima facie showing made by the State.Â  State v. Sharpe, 239 S.C. 258, 122 S.E.2d 622.Â  The lack of mental capacity is an important factor to be considered with other factors in determining whether, in fact, a purported confession was voluntary.Â  Blackburn v. State of Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 274, 4 L.Ed.2d 242.Â  The appellant had the right to introduce evidence of his insanity at the time of his confession for the purpose of impairing or destroying its effect and it was for the jury to determine what weight should be accorded thereto.Â  We think the confession was admissible in evidence.\r\n. . . . \r\nThe record in this case shows that the trial Judge failed to give any instructions whatsoever as to the rules governing confessions.Â  We think this was prejudicial error.Â  The question of whether the appellant was mentally capable of making a confession and understood the contents of his statement and freely and voluntarily executed it should have been submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions.Â  State v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 64 S.E.2d 130, and State v. Clinkscales, 231 S.C. 650, 99 S.E.2d 663.Â  We quote from the last cited case: \r\n  \r\nâ€˜Although all the evidence may be to the effect that a confession made while under arrest was a voluntary one, the jury may not be so convinced; and it is the jury who, in the final analysis, must determine the factual issue of voluntariness.Â  State v. Miller, 211 S.C. 306, 45 S.E.2d 23; State v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 64 S.E.2d 130. Cf. State v. Harris, 212 S.C. 124, 46 S.E.2d 682.Â  Similarly, even though a jury accepts a written confession as having been voluntarily made, it is not thereby bound to accept every statement contained in it as true; for it is the sole judge of its credibility, and may believe it all, or in part, or not at all.Â  It is unreasonable to assume that these matters are within the knowledge of the average juror; he should be informed of them by the Court.Â  Whether such instruction would have altered the verdict in this case is a matter upon which we need not speculate; since life is at stake the case should be remanded, so that upon its retrial the jury may be instructed as to their power, as sole judges of the facts to determine whether or not, under the evidence, the confession was voluntary, and to what extent they will give it credence.â€™\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe think that in all fairness to the trial Judge it should be stated that he was not requested to instruct the jury on the subject of confessions.Â  However, under the well recognized practice of this Court, where the death penalty is involved, these omissions on the part of counsel will not be held to waive the rights of the appellant.\r\n\r\n The judgment of the lower Court is reversed and this case remanded for a new trial.\r\n\r\nCain, 246 S.C. at 541-42, 144 S.E.2d at 907-08.\r\nIn State v. Callahan, 263 S.C. 35, 208 S.E.2d 284 (1974), Callahan confessed to rape, robbery, and burglary.Â  He was indicted, and a jury convicted him of all charges.Â  His confession was the basis for his appeal.Â  The trial judge heard in camera testimony from a psychiatrist, Dr. Forsthoefel, who â€œhad diagnosed the defendant as â€˜mental retardation moderate.â€™â€ Â Id.Â  at 39-40, 208 S.E.2d at 285.Â  Dr. Forsthoefel \r\n\r\ntestified somewhat at length as to his ability to think and reason under stress.Â  He said that the defendant â€˜when subjected to even mild stress would become very labile, excitable and disorganized in his thinking and upset.â€™Â  He did not testify that the defendant did not know legal right from legal wrong.\r\n\r\n263 S.C. at 40, 208 S.E.2d at 285.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter hearing additional testimony, the judge concluded Callahanâ€™s confession â€œâ€˜was freely and voluntarily made after the defendant had been accorded all of his Constitutional rights.â€™â€Â  263 S.C. at 40, 208 S.E.2d at 286.Â  The issue of voluntariness became a question of fact for the jury, and accordingly, the State and Callahan proceeded to offer testimony relating to the confession before the jury.Â  \r\n\r\n  After the State had again submitted its witnesses on the voluntariness issue, and while counsel for the defendant was again presenting his witnesses to the contra, Dr. Forsthoefel was again called to the stand and testified.Â  He said that his diagnosis was that the defendant â€œis moderate mental retardation, I.Q. range of 55 to 65 at the most.â€\r\n  \r\n\r\n  The record then reflects the following:\r\n\r\nâ€œQ. Do you have an opinion as to his ability to think or reason under stress?\r\n\r\nâ€œA. Yes, I do have an opinion.â€ \r\n  \r\n  The solicitor objected to this question and the judge sustained the objection. Later, defense counsel asked this question:\r\n  \r\nÂ \r\nâ€œQ. Okay, Doctor, do you have an opinion as to his quality of thinking?â€\r\nÂ \r\nÂ â€œA. His quality of thinking . . .â€\r\n  \r\n The trial judge interrupted and did not permit the witness to continue to answer.\r\n\r\n263 S.C. at 40, 208 S.E.2d at 286.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe issue for the Callahan court was â€œwhether the defendant was prejudiced by denial of the right to further pursue the question of mental capacityâ€ in the juryâ€™s presence.Â  Id.Â  The court held the trial judge erred by refusing to allow the psychiatristâ€™s answers:\r\n\r\n  A confession is not admissible unless voluntary, and it was for the jury to say in the last analysis whether the confession was or was not voluntary.Â  In State v. Cain, 246 S.C. 536, 144 S.E.2d 905 (1965), this Court held, â€œThe lack of mental capacity is an important factor to be considered with other factors in determining whether, in fact, a purported confession was voluntary.â€Â  Accordingly, the defendant was entitled to submit evidence of the psychiatrist touching on the defendantâ€™s mental capacity and it would have been appropriate to allow both questions quoted hereinabove.\r\n\r\n263 S.C. at 41, 208 S.E.2d at 286.Â  However, the court found no prejudice from the error because the jury heard other testimony of Callahanâ€™s mentality.Â  Id. at 43, S.E.2d at 287 (â€œTo exclude the testimony of Dr. Forsthoefel was inconsistent with our reasoning in Cain, but we think that the jury was fully apprised of the fact that the defendant was of very low mentality short of insanity.â€).\r\nIn State v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 709, 258 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1979), our supreme court recalled, â€œâ€˜We have consistently held that mental deficiency alone is not sufficient to render a confession involuntary but that it is a factor to be considered along with all of the other attendant facts and circumstances in determining the voluntariness of the confession. State v. Cain, 246 S.C. 536, 144 S.E.2d 905; State v. Callahan, 263 S.C. 35, 208 S.E.2d 284.â€™Â  In Re Williams, 265 S.C. 295, 301, 217 S.E.2d 719, 722 (1975).â€Â  \r\nJennings, age twenty-two, confessed to burglarizing a home and killing the resident in State v. Jennings, 280 S.C. 62, 309 S.E.2d 759 (1983).Â  Jennings had a hearing deficiency and was described as â€œâ€˜mildlyâ€™ retarded.â€Â  Id. at 63, 309 S.E.2d at 759.Â  However, the record included testimony that â€œthe officers who questioned appellant were aware of the physical deficiencies and exercised caution to be sure that he could hear and understand the communications with him.â€Â  Id. at 63-64, 309 S.E.2d at 760.Â  The court considered Jenningsâ€™s condition and found his confession voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\nNeither the length of custody before the confession was made, nor the physical deficiencies of the appellant, were conclusive of the issues concerning the voluntariness of the confession, but were factors to be considered by the trial judge, along with the other testimony and circumstances, in determining the admissibility of the alleged confession. We find no basis upon which to disturb the findings of the trial judge that the confession was freely and voluntarily made.\r\n\r\nJennings, 280 S.C. at 64, 309 S.E.2d at 760.\r\n5.Â  Relevance of Expert Testimony to the Voluntariness Analysis \r\nIndubitably, a defendantâ€™s mental capacity is a factor that may be considered both by the court in its Jackson v. Denno hearing analysis, and by the jury in its voluntariness determination.Â  Santiago sought to admit Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony as a means of explaining â€œhis issuing a statement as he did based on his perceptions of his not being treated well, being messed with, his rights violated[.]â€Â  This testimony was relevant to Santiagoâ€™s mental condition at the time of the confession and would have had a tendency to make more probable the allegedly involuntary nature of Santiagoâ€™s confession.Â  As the ultimate arbiter of whether Santiagoâ€™s confession was voluntary, the jury was entitled to hear Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, the trial judge erred in excluding it.Â  \r\nMoreover, the error prejudiced Santiago.Â  Because the trial judge excluded Schwartz-Wattsâ€™s testimony, Santiago was unable to present the jury with evidence relevant to the voluntariness of his confession.Â  Further, the jury was not apprised of Santiagoâ€™s mental capacity through other testimony.Â  Cf. Callahan, 263 S.C. at 42, 208 S.E.2d at 286 (finding error not prejudicial when the jury knew of the defendantâ€™s mental capacity through other testimony).Â  Thus, the error was inimical to Santiago. \r\nThe trial judge erred by failing to give a self-defense charge and committed an abuse of discretion by excluding evidence relevant to the juryâ€™s voluntariness determination.Â  Accordingly, I VOTE to REVERSE Santiagoâ€™s convictions.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Santiago did not call his psychiatrist as a witness.\r\n[2]Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3] According to the testimony of the forensic pathologist, the shots were fired from a distance of six to ten feet.\r\n[4] Â This is not a case where Santiago was justified in using deadly force before his adversary could â€œget the drop on him.â€Â  In Starnes, 340 S.C. at 322, 531 S.E.2d at 913, and State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 661, 244 S.E.2d 503, 507 (1978), the defendantâ€™s adversary was already armed, or the defendant believed his adversary was already armed, when the defendant fired.Â  Here, there is no indication that Wisn was armed or that Santiago believed otherwise.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4128\r\nHeard June 15, 2006 â€“ Filed June 26, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRalph Shealy Kennedy, Jr., and Robert M. Cook, II, both of Batesburg-Leesville, for Appellant.\r\nDavid Cooper Cleveland, Thomas J. Keaveny, II, and Bob J. Conley, all of Charleston, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Jason Shealy appeals the trial courtâ€™s order dismissing his claim for uninsured motorist (UM) coverage, arguing the trial court erred in (1) finding Shealy failed to comply with the witness affidavit requirement of South Carolina Code Annotated section 38-77-170 (2002); and (2) refusing to treat a letter from Safeco Insurance Company as an admission against interest. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn June 7, 2003, Eddie Bolin was driving a pickup truck owned by Dale Leaphart.Â  Shealy and Ronald Cromer sat in the bed of the truck. Â Bolin swerved abruptly, throwing Shealy and Cromer from the truck.Â  Shealy sustained serious injuries, including a fractured skull. Â Bolin later explained to Shealy and the police that he swerved to avoid hitting an unknown vehicle.Â  \r\nShealy filed a complaint against the unknown driver, John Doe, to recover against Safeco, Leaphartâ€™s UM carrier. Â Shealy submitted an affidavit, which he attached and incorporated into the complaint.Â  The affidavit states:\r\n\r\nPersonally appeared before me, Jason Shealy, who being duly sworn deposes and says as follows:\r\nThat he is Jason Shealy and that on or about June 7, 2003, he was a passenger in a pickup truck being driven by Eddie Bolin and, upon information and belief, owned by Dale Leaphart.Â  That the pickup truck was being driven on Highway 391 near Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina.Â  That Eddie Bolin sharply, unexpectedly and suddenly swerved the truck near the entrance to Leaphart Acres, throwing the affiant and another passenger from the bed of the truck onto the roadway.Â  That the day following the incident the affiant was told by Eddie Bolin that an unknown vehicle and driver had come onto the roadway in the path of the truck causing Eddie Bolin to sharply and unexpectedly maneuver the truck he was driving to avoid a collision.\r\nA FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THIS AFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nDoe moved to dismiss Shealyâ€™s action or, alternatively, to change venue.Â  At the motions hearing, Shealy submitted the affidavit of Ronald Cromer, which contains identical language to Shealyâ€™s affidavit.Â  In addition, Shealy submitted a letter from Safeco to his attorney.Â  The letter explained:\r\n\r\n[Safeco has] remained consistent in the lack of negligence and lack of liability of Mr. Eddie Bolin, the driver of the automobile in which your client was occupying [sic].Â  Mr. Bolinâ€™s lack of negligence is due to the phantom vehicle which pulled out in front of him and caused the accident . . . .\r\n\r\nShealy argued the letter was an admission against interest.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted Doeâ€™s motion to dismiss, recognizing its consideration of Cromerâ€™s affidavit and Safecoâ€™s letter converted Doeâ€™s motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.Â  The court held Shealy failed to comply with the witness affidavit requirement of section 38-77-170(2).Â  Shealy filed a motion to reconsider, which the trial court denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may make a motion to dismiss a complaint for â€œfailure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.â€Â  Rule 12(b) additionally provides:\r\n\r\nIf, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the Court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56[.]\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court considered Cromerâ€™s affidavit and the letter from Safeco before granting Doeâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  Accordingly, we review the trial courtâ€™s order as if it were an appeal from a grant of summary judgment.\r\nWhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Houck v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,&nbsp;366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329&nbsp;(2005);Â  Â Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004); see Rule 56(c), SCRCP (â€œThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€). Â In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 611 S.E.2d 485&nbsp;(2005); Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Â Witness Affidavit Requirement\r\nShealy argues the trial court erred in holding the affidavits he submitted were insufficient to satisfy section 38-77-170(2) of the South Carolina Code Annotated (2002).Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 38-77-170 provides:\r\n\r\nIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision, unless:\r\n  \r\n(1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate police authority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n(2) the injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, or the accident must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle; provided however, the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained in the affidavit;\r\n(3) the insured was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the other vehicle and the driver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n  \r\n The following statement must be prominently displayed on the face of the affidavit provided in subitem (2) above: A FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THIS AFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-170 (2002) (emphasis added).Â  â€œAn insured cannot recover uninsured motorist coverage unless the three conditions under Â§ 38-77-170 are met.â€Â  Miller v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 446, 441 S.E.2d 319, 320&nbsp;(1994).\r\nThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692&nbsp;(1996).Â  The first question of statutory interpretation is whether the statuteâ€™s meaning is clear on its face.Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588&nbsp;(2002); Eagle Container Co., LLC v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 622, 622 S.E.2d 733, 738&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nWhen a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed, and this Court has no right to impose another meaning.Â  See Vaughn v. Bernhardt, 345 S.C. 196, 198, 547 S.E.2d 869, 870&nbsp;(2001).Â  â€œ[T]he words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT&amp;T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470&nbsp;(2004); see also Miller, 312 S.C. at 447, 441 S.E.2d at 321 (â€œIn determining the meaning of a statute, the terms used therein must be taken in their ordinary and popular meaning, nothing to the contrary appearing.â€).\r\nSection 38-77-170(2) is clear on its face.Â  It expressly requires that someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle witness the accident.Â  As stated in Wausau Underwriters Insurance Company v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 275, 422 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1992), â€œno physical contact with the unknown vehicle is necessary when a witness other than the owner or driver of the insured vehicle is able to attest to the facts of the accident.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  See also Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 470, 574 S.E.2d 739, 744&nbsp;(2002) (â€œThe plain language of Â§ 38-77-170 requires that where the accident involves no physical contact between the insuredâ€™s vehicle and the unidentified vehicle, the accident â€˜must have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicleâ€™ and the â€˜witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident contained therein.â€™â€).Â  Shealy asserts section 38-77-170(2) does not require the witness affidavit to be based on personal knowledge.Â  This argument directly contravenes the language of the statute.Â  Shealy submitted affidavits of two people who apparently did not witness the accident; their affidavits do not attest to facts they perceived, but merely restate the perceptions of the vehicleâ€™s operator. Â Thus, Shealy produced no evidence that someone other than Bolin, the operator of the insured vehicle, witnessed the accident.Â  Shealyâ€™s and Cromerâ€™s affidavits do not comply with this express directive.Â  \r\nShealyâ€™s interpretation of section 38-77-170(2) would totally eviscerate the statuteâ€™s efficacy as it would allow an owner or operator to inform any third-party of the facts of the accident and have that third-party swear out an affidavit as to the owner or operatorâ€™s version of the events.Â  In Collins, our supreme court elucidated that the â€œobvious purposeâ€ of the affidavit requirement of section 38-77-170(2) is â€œfraud prevention.â€Â  Collins, 352 S.C. at 470, 574 S.E.2d at 743.Â  Shealyâ€™s reading of the statute would circumvent the fraud-preventing function of subsection (2), rendering that section meaningless.Â  \r\nAccording to Shealy, requiring the affiant to have witnessed the accident creates an unreasonably harsh result because a sleeping passenger or blind passenger injured by a John Doe driver might be precluded from recovery.Â  Yet the statute indubitably bars an operator and lone occupant of a vehicle from recovery where no contact is made with the unknown driver and where no one else witnesses the accident.Â  In both instances, the result is lamentable to the injured party, but mandated by the statute.Â  Section 38-77-170 demonstrates a policy decision by the legislature which balances the interest of parties injured in accidents with unknown drivers, with the interest of insurance companies in preventing fraudulent claims.Â  Where the legislature determines policy and promulgates a clear rule of law, there is no room for the courts to alter that decision.Â  Â \r\nFinally, Shealy contends the affidavits comply with Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 592 S.E.2d 626 (2004), because the affidavits he submitted provide circumstantial evidence of the accident.Â  In Gilliland, two young men in a truck were closely pursuing Angel Gilliland.Â  As Gilliland sped up to get away from the truck, she lost control of her car and hit a tree.Â  The truck never made contact with Gillilandâ€™s vehicle.Â  A witness who was stopped at a nearby intersection testified that she â€œsaw the lights of two cars as the cars came around the curve,â€ and that â€œafter the accident, she saw the lights of the car behind Petitionerâ€™s â€˜arc through the fieldâ€™ as if it were making a U-turn.â€Â  357 S.C. at 198-99, 592 S.E.2d at 627.Â  A jury returned a verdict for Gilliland, but we held a witness â€œmust testify to more than the actual collision itself.Â  The witness must also be able to attest to the circumstances surrounding the accident, i.e. what actions of the unknown driver contributed to the accident.â€Â  Gilliland v. Doe, 351 S.C. 497, 501-02, 570 S.E.2d 545, 548 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Accordingly, we reversed the trial court and granted Doeâ€™s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  However, the South Carolina Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the judgment of the trial court.Â  \r\nThe supreme court began with a historical review of the unknown driver statute:\r\n\r\nThe Legislature first enacted a â€œJohn Doeâ€ statute in 1963, recognizing an insuredâ€™s right to receive uninsured motorist coverage for injuries caused by unknown drivers. Since the statuteâ€™s enactment, the Legislature placed\r\nsafeguards within the statute to prevent citizens from bringing fraudulent â€œJohn Doeâ€ actions. Â The initial safeguard was a requirement that the unknown vehicle make â€œphysical contactâ€ with the plaintiffâ€™s car. Â Act No. 312, 1963 S.C. Acts 535.\r\n\r\n    Then in 1987, the Legislature amended the statute once\r\n    again to allow insureds to bring a â€œJohn Doeâ€ action regardless of\r\n    physical contact as long as an independent person witnessed the accident.\r\n    &nbsp;Act. No. 166, 1987 S.C. Acts 1122.\r\nIn 1989, the Legislature again amended the statute to require that the independent witness provide the court with a signed affidavit attesting to the unknown vehicleâ€™s involvement in the accident.\r\n\r\n357 S.C. at 199-200, 592 S.E.2d at 627-28.Â  \r\nThe question for the Gilliland court was â€œto what extent an independent witness must testify about the causal connection between the unknown vehicle and the accident to satisfy the legislatureâ€™s intent to protect insurance companies from fraudulent claims in â€˜John Doeâ€™ actions.â€Â  Id. at 200, 592 S.E.2d at 628.Â  The court answered the question with the following analysis:\r\n\r\nIn Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, 309 S.C. 269, 422 S.E.2d 106, (1992) this Court indicated that the statute required an independent witness to attest to facts that provide at least some causal connection between an unknown driver and the accident.Â  The Court provided that the adequacy of the â€œcausal connectionâ€ should pass the same test used in determining whether an injury or damage arose out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured vehicle. Â Id. at 275, 422 S.E.2d at 110.Â  The Court explained that this test regarding the sufficiency of the evidence is â€œsomething less than proximate cause and something more than the vehicle being the mere site of the injury.â€Â  Id. at 272, 422 S.E.2d at 108 (citing Continental Western Ins. Co. v. Klug, 415 N.W.2d 876 (Minn. 1987)).\r\n Based on the test set forth in Howser, Â§ 38-77-170(2) may be satisfied even though an independent witness fails to provide a clear answer to\r\nthe question of proximate cause.Â  Howser suggests that Â§ 38-77-170(2) should be interpreted liberally.Â  This Court arguably abandoned a liberal interpretation of Â§ 38-77-170(2) in Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002).\r\n In Collins, this Court strictly interpreted Â§ 38-77-170(2). Â This Court held that while the purpose of the affidavit requirement of Â§ 38-77-170(2) could have been met by witness testimony, the statute specifically required that the plaintiff provide an affidavit of an independent witness.\r\n Here, Â§ 38-77-170(2) provides that an independent witness must attest to â€œthe truth of the facts of the accident.â€ Â On one hand, Collins suggests that we should not apply standards that are not specifically set forth in the statute. Â On the other hand, the provision in question here is arguably ambiguous (while the affidavit requirement, according to Collins, is not); therefore, a strict interpretation of Â§ 38-77-170(2) would undermine the statuteâ€™s purpose. Â See Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994) (â€œHowever plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, [we] will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.â€)\r\n\r\n In the case at hand, the Court of Appeals held that the witness must â€œbe able\r\nto attest to the circumstances surrounding the accident, i.e., what actions of the unknown driver contributed to the accident.â€ Â Gilliland, 351 S.C. at 500, 570 S.E.2d at 548. Â We agree that this analysis is consistent with Howser and constitutes a fair interpretation of the ambiguous fact requirement of Â§ 38-77-170(2). Â However, the Court of Appeals found that Norris failed to attest to the existence of an unknown vehicle. Â Gilliland, 351 S.C. at 498, 570 S.E.2d at 546. Â We find the record includes sufficient evidence that an unknown vehicle was involved in Petitionerâ€™s accident.\r\n\r\nGilliland, 357 S.C. at 199-202, 592 S.E.2d at 628-29.Â  The linchpin of the courtâ€™s ruling was its determination that the witness affidavit contained circumstantial evidence corroborating Gillilandâ€™s testimony that an unknown vehicle contributed to her accident:\r\n\r\nIn Marks v. Indus. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 212 S.C. 502, 505, 48 S.E.2d 445, 446, this Court held that â€œ[t]he attending circumstances along with direct testimony may be taken into account by the jury in arriving at its decision as any fact in issue may be established by circumstantial evidence, if the circumstances, which must themselves be proven lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty.â€ \r\n We now hold that the testimony of Gayle Norris contained circumstantial evidence that supports Petitionerâ€™s testimony that an unknown driver contributed to her accident. Â Norrisâ€™s testimony that she saw the lights of an unknown car that was turning around and fleeing the scene of the accident sufficiently corroborates Petitionerâ€™s testimony creating a question of fact as to causation for the jury.\r\n\r\nGilliland, 357 S.C. at 202, 592 S.E.2d at 629 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nâ€œFor circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to warrant the finding of a fact, the circumstances must lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty and must have sufficient probative value to constitute the basis for a legal inference, not for mere speculation.â€Â  Gastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C. 565, 570 n.2, 503 S.E.2d 712, 714 n.2 (1998) (citing Holland v. Georgia Hardwood Lumber Co., 214 S.C. 195, 204-05, 51 S.E.2d 744, 749 (1949)).Â  \r\n\r\nCircumstantial evidence means proof that does not actually assert or represent the proposition in question, but that asserts or describes something else, from which the trier of fact may either (1) reasonably infer the truth of the proposition, in which case the evidence is not only relevant under Rule 401 but is sufficient as well, or (2) at least reasonably infer an increase in the probability that the proposition is in fact true, in which case the evidence is relevant under Rule 401 (assuming that the proposition is of consequence to the determination of the action) but may not be sufficient by itself to create a question for the trier of fact to decide.\r\n\r\n29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 313 (1994) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\nUnlike in Gilliland, the affidavits submitted by Shealy do not contain circumstantial evidence supporting the driverâ€™s version of the accident.Â  Shealy failed to corroborate the driverâ€™s account.Â  In Gilliland, the court found â€œthe testimony of Gail Norris contained circumstantial evidence that supports Petitionerâ€™s testimony.â€Â  357 S.C. at 202, 592 S.E.2d at 629 (emphasis added).Â  Contradistinctively, Shealyâ€™s affidavits merely repeat the driverâ€™s account and fail to provide any support for his assertions.Â Â  \r\nThe purpose of section 38-77-120(2) is to prevent fraud.Â  Concomitantly, the affidavit of the independent witness must contain some independent evidence that an unknown vehicle was involved in the accident.Â  Shealy failed to satisfy the statuteâ€™s mandate; thus, the court properly granted summary judgment.\r\nII.Â  Admission Against Interest\r\nShealy contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Doe because Safecoâ€™s letter constituted an admission against interest.Â  The trial court did not rule on this issue, and Shealy did not raise it in a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding where â€œthe circuit court did not explicitly ruleâ€ on an argument, and no Rule 59(e) motion was made, â€œthe issue was thus not properly before the Court of Appeals and should not have been addressedâ€); Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 235, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726&nbsp;(Ct.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 381, 597 S.E.2d 181, 186&nbsp;(Ct.

Allen, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4129\r\nHeard April 6, 2006 â€“ Filed June 26, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMelissa J. Copeland, and Catherine H. Kennedy, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nRobert K. Whitney, of Seneca, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: Lyn Cherry Stribling (Widow), as personal representative of Joseph Neal Stribling (Husband), brought an action against Linda Dianne Stribling (Wife) seeking a court order requiring Wife to waive her claim to Husbandâ€™s Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) pursuant to a Divorce Decree.Â  Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s order, arguing the court erred in holding Wife waived interest in non-employment related retirement accounts and erred in holding any waiver applied to her expectancy interest.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on December 22, 1973.Â  During their marriage, Husband established two IRAs: a Charles Schwab IRA in December of 1993 and a TD Waterhouse IRA in March of 1998.Â  Husband named Wife as primary beneficiary for both IRAs; a charity was also named as a five percent beneficiary for the Schwab IRA.Â  \r\nIn February 2003, Husband and Wife divorced pursuant to a Divorce Decree.Â  The Decree incorporated the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement.Â  The Decree and agreement awarded ownership of both IRAs to Husband.[1]Â  The Decree also provided, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nThe parties acknowledge that each party is retaining his or her retirement accounts accumulated through their respective employment.Â  The parties further acknowledge they are waiving any interest they may have in the other partyâ€™s retirement.Â  As a result, the parties agree to sign any and all documentation necessary to fully waive any right or entitlement he or she may have had in the retirement of the other.Â  The parties will fully cooperate in securing the necessary waivers, releases, QDROâ€™s or other required documents for the signature of the waiving party.Â  \r\n\r\nNot long after the partiesâ€™ divorce, Husband married Widow.Â  Husband died on July 25, 2004.Â  At the time of Husbandâ€™s death, Wife was the named beneficiary of the Waterhouse IRA and the named beneficiary of ninety-five percent of the Schwab IRA.Â  On March 16, 2005, Widow, as personal representative of Husbandâ€™s estate, brought an action against Wife seeking a court order requiring Wife to waive her claim to Husbandâ€™s IRAs pursuant to the Divorce Decree. Â Â \r\nA hearing was held on May 3, 2005.Â  By order, the family court ruled that the â€œlanguage of the settlement is clear and sufficiently comprehensive so as to establish [Wife] had waived or relinquished any interest, including expectancy interest, in [Husbandâ€™s] retirement.â€Â  As a result, the court ordered Wife to sign documentation necessary to waive any rights or entitlement to the IRAs.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to construe a written contract is an action at law.â€Â \r\nS. Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 349 S.C. 77, 80, 562 S.E.2d 482, 484 (Ct. App. 2002), affâ€™d as modified, 356 S.C. 444, 590 S.E.2d 27 (2003).Â  Whether a contractâ€™s language is ambiguous is a question of law. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  â€œ[W]hen a contract is clear and unambiguous, the construction thereof is a question of law for the court.â€Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 345 S.C. 243, 249, 547 S.E.2d 877, 880 (Ct. App. 2001), affâ€™d, 352 S.C. 494, 575 S.E.2d 573 (2003).Â  â€œWhile a trial courtâ€™s findings of fact in a nonjury action at law should not be disturbed on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support, a reviewing court is free to decide questions of law with no particular deference to the trial court.â€Â  Hunt v. S.C. Forestry Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564, 569, 595 S.E.2d 849, 848-49 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWaiver of Interest in Husbandâ€™s IRAs \r\nWife argues the family court erred in holding the Divorce Decree clearly established Wife waived her interest in the Husbandâ€™s IRAs.Â  Specifically, Wife asserts the Divorce Decree only establishes waiver of interest in employment related retirement accounts, and the Decree does not apply to the IRAs because they are non-employment retirement accounts.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe construction of an agreement is a matter of contract law.Â  McDuffie v. McDuffie, 313 S.C. 397, 399, 438 S.E.2d 239, 241 (1993).Â  â€œIn construing a contract, the primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.â€Â \r\nS. Atl. Fin. Servs., 349 S.C. at 80, 562 S.E.2d at 484.Â  â€œThe partiesâ€™ intention must, in the first instance, be derived from the language of the contract.â€Â  Jacobs v. Serv. Merch. Co., 297 S.C. 123, 128, 375 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œIf its language is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, no construction is required and the contractâ€™s language determines the instrumentâ€™s force and effect.â€Â  Id. Â â€œMere lack of clarity on casual reading is not the standard for determining whether a contract is afflicted with ambiguity.â€ Â Gamble, Givens &amp; Moody v. Moise, 288 S.C. 210, 215, 341 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nWe find the language of the Decree unambiguously provides Wife waived any interest in all of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts.Â  The relevant language of the Decree states that each of the parties retain their â€œretirement accounts accumulated through their respective employment.â€Â  The Decree then provides that the parties â€œfurther acknowledge they are waiving any interest they may have in the other partyâ€™s retirement.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The inclusion of the word â€œfurtherâ€ indicates that, in addition to each party retaining their respective employment-related retirement accounts, each party waives any interest in any of the other partyâ€™s retirement.Â  The Decree does not limit this waiver of interest to employment related retirement accounts, but rather simply states the waiver applies to the â€œother partyâ€™s retirement.â€Â  This interpretation is further substantiated by the settlement agreement which specifically lists both IRAs in Husbandâ€™s column.Â  Accordingly, after looking at the Decree as a whole, we find the trial court did not err in finding the Decree was clearly and sufficiently comprehensive to establish Wife waived any interest in Husbandâ€™s retirement, including Husbandâ€™s IRAs.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nExpectancy Interest \r\nWife next contends the family court erred in finding any waiver of interest in Husbandâ€™s IRAs encompassed a waiver of an expectancy interest in the IRAs.Â  We disagree. \r\nGenerally, in South Carolina, divorce does not per se affect the rights of a beneficiary interest.Â  See, e.g., Duncan v. Investors Diversified Serv., Inc., 285 S.C. 467, 470, 330 S.E.2d 295, 296 (1985) (holding divorce does not of itself operate to defeat the beneficiaryâ€™s claim to proceeds under a life insurance policy). Â However, it is generally recognized that a beneficiary may contract away the beneficiary interest through a separation or property settlement agreement, even if the beneficiary designation is not formally changed.Â  Estate of Revis by Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 477, 484 S.E.2d 112, 116 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Estate of Revis, this court held: \r\n  \r\n[W]hen a separation agreement does not specifically address a life insurance policy in which one spouse has an expectancy as a named beneficiary, general language of release . . . is not controlling on the issue. Where the insured spouse maintains ownership and control of the policy, including the right to change\r\nbeneficiaries, the question of whether or not the agreement extinguishes the right of the named beneficiary to claim the benefits upon the death of the estranged spouse depends upon the intention of the insured spouse as determined by the facts of each case.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 478, 484 S.E.2d at 116-17.Â  The beneficiary interest in a life insurance policy is analogous to the beneficiary interest in an IRA.Â  Like the beneficiary in a life insurance policy, the IRA beneficiary merely has an expectancy interest in the IRA until the ownerâ€™s death.Â  See Luszcz v. Lavoie, 787 So. 2d 245, 248 (Fla. 2d Dist. Ct. App. 2001) (in holding that the IRA beneficiary designation controlled in a case where the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement did not include releases of claims against each other, the court noted that â€œa beneficiaryâ€™s rights to proceeds do not attach until the IRA ownerâ€™s death.Â  Until then, the beneficiary merely has an expectancy in the IRA because until the ownerâ€™s death, the owner can do with the IRA as desired, including changing the beneficiary designation or cashing out the account altogetherâ€); Rishel v. Estate of Rishel, 781 N.E.2d 735, 742 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003) (in finding that the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement only included a waiver of property in general and did not amount to a specific waiver of an expectancy interest in an annuity, the court noted there was no distinction between the expectancy interest in life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and annuities).Â  Â Â \r\nIn Rushton v. Lott, this court, quoting the above language in Estate of Revis, held a separation agreement may be interpreted to preclude a beneficiaryâ€™s interest in an annuity even though the agreement did not specifically mention the annuity.Â  Rushton v. Lott, 330 S.C. 418, 420, 499 S.E.2d 222, 224 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The separation agreement in Rushton provided: â€œEach party shall retain exclusive ownership and possession of their respective savings, checking or retirement accounts now in their possession.â€Â  Id. at 420, 499 S.E.2d at 223.Â  The court held the agreement precluded the named beneficiary from claiming rights to the proceeds of an annuity because parol evidence indicated the parties viewed the annuity as an IRA and, therefore, intended to include the annuity in the separation agreement.Â  In Rushton, this court upheld the trial courtâ€™s use of parol evidence to determine the separation agreement applied to an annuity.Â  Id. at 421, 499 S.E.2d at 224.Â  Â Â \r\nThus, in South Carolina, a separation agreement may preclude a named beneficiary from recovery of an expectancy interest in two ways.Â  First, a named beneficiary may be precluded from recovery when a separation agreement specifically addresses a particular policy/account providing an expectancy interest and the agreement contains language of release applicable to the policy/account.Â  Second, when a separation agreement provides general language of release without specifically addressing the policy/account providing the expectancy interest, a named beneficiary may be precluded from recovery when the policy/account owner intended for the general waiver to apply to the expectancy interest.Â  In other words, for separation agreements that do not specifically address a policy/account providing an expectancy interest, a general waiver is not controlling, and the effect of the general release on the expectancy interest â€œdepends upon the intention of the [policy/account owning] spouse as determined by the facts of each case.â€Â Â  Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at 478, 484 S.E.2d at 117. \r\nIn this case, we find the waiver contained in the separation agreement is controlling because the agreement specifically addresses the IRAs.Â  The agreement provides the parties waive â€œany interest they may have in the other partyâ€™s retirement.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The agreement then clearly lists the IRAs in Husbandâ€™s column and provides â€œHusband will receive all assets in his column.â€ Â Thus, the agreement specifically references the IRAs providing the expectancy interest and is accompanied by a clear waiver of any interest, including present or future interests.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not err in finding Wife waived her expectancy interest in Husbandâ€™s IRAs. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the family court did not err in finding Wife waived her interest in Husbandâ€™s IRAs.Â  The decision of the court is accordingly\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Decree provided that â€œ[t]he parties have agreed to a division of their assets as set out in [their settlement agreement]â€ and â€œWife will receive all assets in her column, and Husband will receive all assets in his column.â€Â  The settlement agreement listed both IRA accounts in Husbandâ€™s column.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
