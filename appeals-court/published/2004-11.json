Doar, Jr., of Georgetown, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Teresa Shadwell appeals \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of James Craigie, M.D., \r\n  and Loris Surgical Associates (collectively â€œRespondentsâ€) in this medical malpractice \r\n  action.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.\r\nFACTS  \r\nIn January 1996, Shadwell was referred to Dr. Craigie \r\n  by her treating physician, Dr. Robert A. Ziff, because she was experiencing \r\n  lower abdominal pain.Â  Dr. Craigie ordered laboratory tests for Shadwell at \r\n  Loris Hospital Laboratory prior to performing a colonoscopy.Â  The lab results \r\n  were reported to Dr. Craigie on January 25, 1996.Â  The results showed Shadwell \r\n  had an elevated creatinine level, indicating problems with her kidneys.Â  Dr. \r\n  Craigie performed a colonoscopy on Shadwell on January 26, 1996.Â  Shadwell returned \r\n  to Dr. Craigieâ€™s office for a follow-up examination on February 9, 1996, at \r\n  which time she complained of abdominal cramps and diarrhea.Â  Shadwell was scheduled \r\n  to return on March 27, 1996, on a â€œneeds basis â€“ only if she continued to have \r\n  complaints,â€ but she did not appear for the appointment.Â  Dr. Craigie had no \r\n  further contact with Shadwell following the February visit.Â  Dr. Craigie never \r\n  informed Shadwell of the test results indicating problems with her kidneys, \r\n  nor did he forward the results to Shadwellâ€™s treating physician, Dr. Ziff.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn January and February of 1998, while pregnant \r\n  with her daughter, Shadwell underwent two twenty-four hour kidney tests at Loris \r\n  Hospital at the direction of Dr. Ziff.Â  These tests revealed her kidneys were \r\n  functioning at only twenty percent of normal capacity.Â  Following the birth \r\n  of her daughter, Shadwellâ€™s kidney function began to deteriorate, at one point \r\n  functioning at only eight percent.Â  Because her kidneys were not functioning \r\n  properly, Shadwell went on dialysis to assist in removing toxins from her blood.Â  \r\n  On August 14, 2000, Shadwell successfully underwent a kidney transplant. \r\nIn 2001, Shadwell filed suit against Dr. Ziff and \r\n  other physicians who provided treatment during her pregnancy.Â  One of the grounds \r\n  for the lawsuit was that Dr. Ziff failed to properly diagnose her condition \r\n  after receiving the results from the 1998 kidney function tests.Â Â Â  \r\nDuring the course of preparing for the case against \r\n  Dr. Ziff, the parties took several depositions including that of Shadwell, Dr. \r\n  Ziff, and Dr. Craigie.Â  It is not clear from the record when Shadwell learned \r\n  of the January 1996 lab results showing elevated creatinine levels.Â  During \r\n  Dr. Craigieâ€™s August 17, 2001 deposition, he confirmed the January 1996 lab \r\n  results.Â  During Shadwellâ€™s September 12, 2001 deposition, she testified that \r\n  she learned at Duke Hospital in late 1998 that she should have been made aware \r\n  of prior lab results.Â  It is not altogether clear whether she was referring \r\n  to the results from Dr. Craigieâ€™s 1996 lab tests or from the tests performed \r\n  early in 1998 during her pregnancy.Â  During Dr. Ziffâ€™s October 17, 2001 deposition, \r\n  he was shown the results from the January 1996 tests for the first time.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nShadwell commenced the current action against Dr. \r\n  Craigie and Loris Surgical Associates on March 4, 2002, alleging, among other \r\n  things, that Dr. Craigie was negligent in: (1) failing to discuss these lab \r\n  results with her, and (2) failing to forward a copy of the results to Dr. Ziff, \r\n  as her referring physician, or to inform any of Shadwellâ€™s other physicians \r\n  of the abnormal results.Â  Shadwell alleged in her complaint that she first became \r\n  aware of Dr. Craigieâ€™s negligence when she received discovery in the prior case.Â  \r\n  Specifically, she stated â€œ[t]hat until August 17, 2001, [she] was unaware that \r\n  any duty had been breached by [Dr.] Craigie or that any negligence occurred.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents answered the complaint with general \r\n  denials and asserted that the statute of limitations governing medical malpractice \r\n  actions barred the case.Â  Accordingly, Respondents moved to have the case dismissed \r\n  under Rule 12(c), SCRCP.Â  On July 8, 2002, the court denied the motion finding \r\n  it to be premature.Â  Respondents then filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  The \r\n  primary dispute at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration concentrated \r\n  on whether the action was filed within the six-year time period established \r\n  by the statute of repose. \r\nOn September 23, 2002, the trial court issued an \r\n  order denying the motion for reconsideration holding that a genuine issue of \r\n  material fact existed concerning when the physician-patient relationship ended \r\n  between Shadwell and Dr. Craigie.Â  Thus, the trial court found that an issue \r\n  of fact existed as to whether Shadwellâ€™s action was barred by the statue of \r\n  repose. Â Following receipt of this order, Respondents moved pursuant \r\n  to Rule 59(e), SCRCP to alter or amend, seeking a ruling as to whether the three-year \r\n  statute of limitations also acted as a time bar to Shadwellâ€™s action.\r\nIn an order dated November 15, 2002, the trial \r\n  court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  Based on the deposition \r\n  testimony taken in Shadwellâ€™s prior lawsuit, the court ruled that by the end \r\n  of 1998, Shadwell â€œwas aware of sufficient facts that would have put her on \r\n  notice of the existence of a cause of action against Dr. Craigie for allegedly \r\n  not informing her of the results of the lab tests performed on her on January \r\n  24, 1996.â€Â  Therefore, because Shadwell did not file her suit against Dr. Craigie \r\n  until March 2002, her action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\r\nShadwell filed a motion to alter or amend arguing \r\n  the trial court erred in dismissing her claims.Â  Shadwell argued that she raised \r\n  two claims in her complaint: (1) that Dr. Craigie committed malpractice in failing \r\n  to inform her of the lab results; and (2) that Dr. Craigie committed malpractice \r\n  in failing to inform her referring physician of the lab results.Â  Because she \r\n  did not learn until Dr. Ziffâ€™s October 17, 2001 deposition that Dr. Craigie \r\n  failed to inform him of the test results, Shadwell argued the trial court erred \r\n  in also dismissing her second claim as barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  Shadwell argued that these two allegations of negligence constituted separate \r\n  and independent causes of action, and thus, the court erred in dismissing her \r\n  case.Â  The trial court denied Shadwellâ€™s motion by order dated November 25, \r\n  2002.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 294, 584 S.E.2d 149, \r\n  151 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate when â€œâ€˜there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP).Â  \r\n  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary \r\n  judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  McNair \r\n  v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 341, 499 S.E.2d 488, 493 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nShadwell argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment because the record does not support the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that she should have known about Dr. Craigieâ€™s failures by late 1998.Â  \r\n  Regardless of when Shadwell learned of Dr. Craigieâ€™s failures, the record in \r\n  this case supports a finding that Shadwellâ€™s cause of action for failure to \r\n  inform her of the test results was barred by the statute of repose. \r\n  [1] \r\nMedical malpractice actions are governed by a three-year \r\n  statute of limitations and a six-year statute of repose.Â  The statute provides:\r\n\r\nIn any action, other than \r\n  actions controlled by section (B), to recover damages for injury to the person \r\n  arising out of any medical, surgical, or dental treatment, omission, or operation \r\n  by any licensed health care provider . . . acting within the scope of his profession \r\n  must be commenced within three years from the date of the treatment, omission, \r\n  or operation giving rise to the cause of action or three years from date of \r\n  discovery or when it reasonably ought to have been discovered, not to exceed \r\n  six years from date of occurrence, or as tolled by this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-545(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added). [2] \r\nRespondents contended the trial court properly granted summary \r\n  judgment in their favor because the occurrence took place more than six years \r\n  prior to the commencement of Shadwellâ€™s action. On the other hand, Shadwell \r\n  argued that the statute of repose did not bar her action against Dr. Craigie \r\n  because the time period was tolled while she was under Dr. Craigieâ€™s continuous \r\n  treatment.Â  Thus, Shadwell asserted the â€œoccurrenceâ€ did not happen until after \r\n  she missed her March 27, 1996 appointment.Â  \r\nOur supreme court has recently addressed the continuous \r\n  treatment doctrine.Â  In Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  109 (2003), the guardian for James L. McLean sued the Department of Mental Health \r\n  and various physicians for negligence in their treatment of McLean from 1982 \r\n  until his discharge in 1995.Â  The court declined to adopt the continuous treatment/continuous \r\n  tort doctrine, stating that â€œjudicial adoption of the continuous treatment rule \r\n  would run afoul of the absolute limitations policy the Legislature has clearly \r\n  setâ€ through statute, including the statute of repose.Â  Harrison, 354 \r\n  S.C. at 138, 580 S.E.2d at 114; see also Hoffman v. Powell, \r\n  298 S.C. 338, 339-340, 380 S.E.2d 821, 821 (1989) (holding that the statute \r\n  of repose â€œconstitutes an outer limit beyond which a medical malpractice claim \r\n  is barred, regardless of whether it has or should have been discovered.â€); Dunbar \r\n  v. Carlson, 341 S.C. 261, 269, 533 S.E.2d 913, 917 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œ[T]he \r\n  statute of repose imposes an outer limit for filing a medical malpractice action, \r\n  regardless of when it is discovered.â€).Â  Thus, the statute of repose in the \r\n  present case was not tolled by the time period between Shadwellâ€™s February 1996 \r\n  and March 1996 appointments, presumably a period of time she was under the care \r\n  of Dr. Craigie.Â  \r\nWe need only determine the time of the â€œoccurrenceâ€ \r\n  in order to determine if the statute of repose barred this cause of action.Â  \r\n  This court has previously determined the date of occurrence in a medical malpractice \r\n  claim.Â  Oâ€™Tuel v. Villani, 318 S.C. 24, 455 S.E.2d 698 (Ct. App. 1995), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, \r\n  338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).Â  In Oâ€™Tuel, parents alleged their \r\n  child was injured during birth when they discovered he had certain physical \r\n  and learning disabilities when he entered school.Â  They sued the delivering \r\n  physician nine years after the child was born.Â  This court found that since \r\n  the date of â€œoccurrenceâ€ was the date of the childâ€™s delivery, the statute of \r\n  repose barred the parentsâ€™ action against the physician.Â  Oâ€™Tuel, 318 \r\n  S.C. at 27, 455 S.E.2d at 700 (holding that â€œwhile the parentsâ€™ claim may have \r\n  accrued when Adam started school, their claim is nonetheless barred because \r\n  it was instituted more than six years from the date of occurrence, in this case, \r\n  the date of Adamâ€™s birthâ€).\r\n  In the present case, the occurrence happened when Dr. Craigie \r\n  failed to inform Shadwell about the elevated creatinine levels discovered in \r\n  her January 1996 test results.Â  Dr. Craigie knew about the results before the \r\n  January 26, 1996 colonoscopy.Â  Dr. Craigie should have informed Shadwell within \r\n  a reasonable time after learning the results, either at the time of the colonoscopy, \r\n  or at the latest, at her follow-up appointment on February 9, 1996.Â  Since he \r\n  failed to do so, we agree with the trial court that the occurrence in this case \r\n  is no later than the date of Shadwellâ€™s last appointment, February 9, 1996.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the six-year statute of repose for Shadwellâ€™s cause of action against \r\n  Dr. Craigie for his failure to inform her of the test results expired prior \r\n  to the March 4, 2002 filing of the action against Dr. Craigie, regardless of \r\n  when Shadwell discovered his omission. \r\nII\r\nShadwell also argues the trial court erred in not \r\n  specifically addressing her â€œsecond cause of actionâ€ of Dr. Craigieâ€™s failure \r\n  to inform Dr. Ziff, her treating physician, of the 1996 test results. Â \r\nAs noted, among other allegations, Shadwell averred \r\n  in her complaint that Dr. Craigie committed two acts of negligence: (1) failing \r\n  to inform her of the test results, and (2) failing to forward a copy of the \r\n  results to Dr. Ziff as her referring physician. On appeal, Shadwell argues her \r\n  second allegation of negligence constitutes a separate cause of action.Â  She, \r\n  therefore, argues the evidence shows she could not have been aware that Dr. \r\n  Craigie failed to inform Dr. Ziff of the test results until Dr. Ziff testified \r\n  to as much in his deposition on October 17, 2001.Â  Accordingly, since she filed \r\n  her complaint in March 2002, the statute of limitations would not act as a bar \r\n  to this cause of action. [3] \r\nTo support her contention that Dr. Craigieâ€™s failure \r\n  to inform her treating physician of the test results constitutes a separate \r\n  cause of action, Shadwell relies on this courtâ€™s decision in Jernigan v. \r\n  King, 312 S.C. 331, 440 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In Jernigan, \r\n  a physician admitted the plaintiff to a hospital after plaintiff complained \r\n  of severe headaches.Â  Id. at 332, 440 S.E.2d at 380.Â  While covering \r\n  for plaintiffsâ€™ admitting physician, another doctor was called to answer an \r\n  emergency code from plaintiffâ€™s room.Â  After resuscitating plaintiff, this physician \r\n  ordered a number of tests be performed including a CT scan.Â  Thereafter, the \r\n  admitting physician resumed care for plaintiff.Â  Id.\r\nNeither physician reviewed the results of the CT \r\n  scan, which revealed plaintiff was suffering from intracranial hemorrhaging.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Four days later, while again covering for plaintiffâ€™s admitting \r\n  physician, the same doctor who ordered the first CT scan ordered a second.Â  \r\n  Upon receiving and reviewing the results, the doctor performed immediate surgery \r\n  to remedy the problem.Â  Id. at 332-33, 440 S.E.2d at 380.Â  Thus, the \r\n  essence of plaintiffâ€™s claim was that the delay in treatment caused permanent \r\n  brain damage.Â  Id. at 333, 440 S.E.2d at 380. \r\nSpecifically, the plaintiff averred that once the \r\n  physician ordered the CT scan the first time, he had an obligation to review \r\n  the results, or at the very least, to see that another physician did.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Although this Court eventually found against the plaintiff, in reaching this \r\n  conclusion, we stated:Â  â€œ[w]e assume, without deciding, [plaintiff] is \r\n  correct that once [the operating physician] ordered a CT scan on August 3, he \r\n  was under a duty to see to it that the scan was performed and to see the results, \r\n  or to see to it that someone else evaluated the results.â€Â  Id. at 333, \r\n  440 S.E.2d at 381 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nFrom this statement, Shadwell asserts we recognized \r\n  a separate and distinct cause of action for a physicianâ€™s failure to inform \r\n  a patientâ€™s primary physician of pertinent test results. Shadwell, however, \r\n  fails to recognize that in Jernigan we specifically declined to rule \r\n  on the issue. Â Accordingly, as a review of our case law uncovers a lack of authority \r\n  on point, the question is a matter of first impression. \r\n  [4]   \r\nÂ Here, the trial court summarily disposed of this \r\n  issue, which could have significant implications concerning the liability to \r\n  which consulting physicians may be exposed. Additionally, application of the \r\n  statute of limitations and/or the statute of repose to any cause of action Shadwell \r\n  may have for Dr. Craigieâ€™s failure to report the test results to Dr. Ziff may \r\n  differ from her other cause of action. Moreover, the standard for reporting \r\n  such findings and proximate cause are issues that need to be developed further. \r\n  We, thus, hold the trial court improperly disposed of the question by granting \r\n  summary judgment. ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, \r\n  320 S.C. 143, 153, 463 S.E.2d 618, 624 (Ct. App.1995) (stating that although \r\n  all issues of novel impression do not require a trial, summary judgment is inappropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts is desirable to clarify application of \r\n  the law); See Shea v. State Dept. of Mental Retardation, 279 S.C. \r\n  604, 611, 310 S.E.2d 819, 822 (Ct. App. 1983) (â€œIf the statuteâ€™s application \r\n  is not absolutely clear as a matter of law, [the] question should not be decided \r\n  without fully developing the facts by means of trial.â€) overruled on other \r\n  grounds by McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985). [5] \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nShadwellâ€™s cause of action based on the failure of Dr. Craigie to inform her \r\n  of the test results is barred by the statute of repose.Â  Because the issue of \r\n  whether the respondents are liable to Shadwell for Dr. Craigieâ€™s failure to \r\n  notify Dr. Ziff of the test results needs further factual development and is \r\n  a novel issue, we hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. Â Accordingly, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order is reversed as to the latter issue, and this case is \r\n  remanded to the trial court for a determination as to whether Dr. Craigieâ€™s \r\n  failure to notify Dr. Ziff of the abnormal test results constituted actionable \r\n  negligence for which Shadwell may recover against the Respondents.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  An appellate court may affirm \r\n    a trial courtâ€™s order based on any grounds found in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), \r\n    SCACR; Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 \r\n    S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (holding that an appellate court may affirm the circuit \r\n    courtâ€™s ruling using any additional reasons that are both raised by the respondentâ€™s \r\n    brief and found within the record). Respondents also argue this basis for \r\n    affirmance in their brief.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  In Langley v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 438 S.E.2d 242 (1993), \r\n    our supreme court discussed the tolling language in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-545(A).Â  \r\n    The court noted that the tolling language in subsection (A) â€œclearly indicates \r\n    that the only tolling of Â§ 15-3-545(A) intended by the legislature \r\n    is that contained in subsection (D).â€Â  Langley, 313 S.C. at 403, 438 \r\n    S.E.2d at 243.Â  Subsection (D) provides that the statute will be tolled to \r\n    a certain extent for minors injured by healthcare providers.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 15-3-545(D) (Supp. 2003). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Although Respondents suggest this argument is not preserved because \r\n    Shadwell did not raise it at the time the motion for summary judgment was \r\n    heard, we disagree.Â  Both allegations of negligence were included in Shadwellâ€™s \r\n    complaint. Furthermore, Shadwellâ€™s position at the summary judgment hearing \r\n    was to argue against Respondentsâ€™ assertion that her action was time barred, \r\n    not to support her allegations of negligence.Â  Finally, Shadwell did specifically \r\n    raise this claim in her Rule 59(e) motion submitted after receipt of the courtâ€™s \r\n    summary judgment order. Moreover, in denying Shadwellâ€™s motion for reconsideration, \r\n    the court found: â€œthat both parties fully expounded all issues raised in [Shadwellâ€™s] \r\n    Motion for Reconsideration at the previous hearing.â€ Â We therefore \r\n    find the issue is preserved for our review.Â  See Staubes v. City \r\n    of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  In fact, Respondents argue in their brief that it is a novel issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  While Jernigan did not recognize a separate cause of action \r\n    for failure of a consulting physician to notify the referring physician of \r\n    a patientâ€™s abnormal test results, we suggest there is a duty on the part \r\n    of the consulted physician to report abnormal test results to the treating \r\n    physician if the results indicate a need for further follow-up or treatment. \r\n    Other courts have likewise concluded such a duty exists. See Sinclair \r\n    v. Roth, 811 A.2d 460, 465 (2002) (â€œThere is little doubt that the specialist \r\n    has a duty to advise the referring physician of his findings.â€); Munoz \r\n    v.

Arthur, III, all of \r\n          Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to Windsor \r\n  Green Owners Association, Inc. on its claim that Allied Signal, Inc. was contractually \r\n  liable for damages to the common area of a condominium complex that were caused \r\n  by a fire.Â  The court found Windsor Green was a third-party beneficiary to a \r\n  lease agreement Allied had with one of the condominium owners.Â  Allied appeals.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 23, 1998, Allied entered into a rental agreement with J.B. Allen \r\n  Real Estate for the lease of a condominium at the Windsor Green condominium \r\n  complex in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  J.B. Allen Real Estate was the agent \r\n  for the owners, Earl and Ula Reitzel.Â  Windsor Green, the homeownersâ€™ association \r\n  for the complex, was not mentioned in the rental agreement.Â  \r\nAllied allowed one of its employees, Stanley Kaminski, to move into the condominium \r\n  following a fire that destroyed his home.Â  On November 28, 1998, the condominium \r\n  caught fire.Â  An investigation revealed that Kaminskiâ€™s son, Michael, had set \r\n  both fires.Â  Michael confessed to a history of arsonist activity.Â  Allied had \r\n  no knowledge of Michaelâ€™s arsonist tendencies prior to the condominium fire.Â  \r\n\r\nWindsor Green is comprised of all the individual condominium owners.Â  Each \r\n  owner retains an undivided interest in the common areas of the complex.Â  The \r\n  â€œWindsor Green Condominiums Rules and Regulationsâ€ make individual owners responsible \r\n  for costs and repairs to their condominiums and for any resultant damage to \r\n  any adjacent unit.Â  Owners are also responsible for damage caused by their tenants.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn December 27, 2000, Windsor Green sent a letter to Allied demanding payment \r\n  of $524,712.09 for damage to the common area of the condominium complex caused \r\n  by the fire.Â  Windsor Green asserted Allied was contractually liable for the \r\n  damage because Windsor Green was a third-party beneficiary to the rental agreement \r\n  between Allied and J.B. Allen Real Estate based on paragraph K of the agreement.Â  \r\n  That paragraph provides as follows:\r\n\r\nDAMAGEÂ Â Â Â  K.Â  Damage to the Property caused by Resident, Residentâ€™s family \r\n  or guests, will be repaired and costs billed to the Resident and payable on \r\n  demand.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter Allied refused to pay for the damage, Windsor Green filed suit against \r\n  Allied, Stanley Kaminski, and Honeywell International, Inc., [1]  alleging claims of negligence \r\n  and breach of contract.Â  \r\nAllied later moved for summary judgment on all causes of action.Â  Some time \r\n  thereafter, Windsor Green moved for partial summary judgment on its claim of \r\n  breach of contract.Â Â Â  \r\nJudge Steven H. John granted Alliedâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the negligence \r\n  claim, but denied its motion on the breach of contract claim.Â  The next day, \r\n  Judge John L. Breeden, Jr. granted Windsor Greenâ€™s motion for partial summary \r\n  judgment on the breach of contract claim and entered judgment in favor of Windsor \r\n  Green against Allied in the stipulated amount of $524,712.09.Â  Judge Breeden \r\n  found Windsor Green was a third-party beneficiary to the rental agreement and \r\n  thus entitled to recover for breach of contract for damage caused to the common \r\n  area of the condominium complex.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies \r\n  the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  \r\n  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  â€œSummary \r\n  judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  \r\n  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999).Â  \r\n  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all \r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. \r\n  36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAllied contends the circuit court erred in finding Windsor Green was a third-party \r\n  beneficiary to the rental agreement between Allied and J.B. Allen Real Estate \r\n  and in awarding damages to Windsor Green for breach of contract.Â  We agree.\r\nIt is undisputed that Windsor Green is not a named party to the rental agreement.Â  \r\n  â€œGenerally, one not in privity of contract with another cannot maintain an action \r\n  against him in breach of contract, and any damage resulting from the breach \r\n  of a contract between the defendant and a third party is not, as such, recoverable \r\n  by the plaintiff.â€Â  Bob Hammond Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. Co., 312 \r\n  S.C. 422, 424, 440 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œHowever, if a contract \r\n  is made for the benefit of a third person, that person may enforce the contract \r\n  if the contracting parties intended to create a direct, rather than an incidental \r\n  or consequential, benefit to such third person.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œThe main guide in contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect \r\n  to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the language of the lease.â€Â  \r\n  Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 30, 586 S.E.2d 861, 864 (Ct. App. 2003) \r\n  (holding it was clear the lease language evidenced no intent to make the plaintiff, \r\n  either as a guest or a tenant, a third-party beneficiary by imposing a duty \r\n  in tort on the landlord to prevent a tenantâ€™s dog from injuring another).Â  \r\nâ€œIf a contractâ€™s language is clear and capable of legal construction, this \r\n  Courtâ€™s function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties \r\n  as found in the agreement.â€ Â Id. at 30-31, 586 S.E.2d at 864.Â  â€œA clear \r\n  and explicit contract must be construed according to the terms the parties have \r\n  used, with the terms to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and \r\n  popular sense.â€Â  Id. at 31, 586 S.E.2d at 864.\r\nThe circuit court rejected Alliedâ€™s argument that the rental agreement in this \r\n  case could not be interpreted to indicate the partiesâ€™ intention to bestow third-party \r\n  benefits upon Windsor Green.Â  The court noted condominiums are creatures of \r\n  statute; thus, the rental agreement must be interpreted in view of the provisions \r\n  of the South Carolina Horizontal Property Regime Act.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSection 27-31-120 of the Horizontal Property Act states â€œ[a]ny conveyance or \r\n  lease of an individual apartment is deemed to also convey or lease the undivided \r\n  interest of the owner in the common elements, both general and limited, appertaining \r\n  to the apartment without specifically or particularly referring to same.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-120 (1991).Â  \r\nAs noted above, paragraph K of the rental agreement provided:Â  â€œDamage to the \r\n  Property caused by Resident, Residentâ€™s family or guests, will be repaired and \r\n  costs billed to the Resident and payable on demand.â€Â  â€œPropertyâ€ was not specifically \r\n  defined in the rental agreement.\r\nThe term â€œpropertyâ€ is defined in the Horizontal Property Act as including \r\n  â€œ(1) the land whether leasehold or in fee simple and whether or not submerged, \r\n  (2) the building, all improvements, and structures on the land, in existence \r\n  or to be constructed, and (3) all easements, rights, and appurtenances belonging \r\n  thereto.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-20(k) (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe circuit court found Allied had agreed to pay for any damage to the common \r\n  areas under paragraph K of the rental agreement by applying the Horizontal Property \r\n  Actâ€™s definition of â€œpropertyâ€ to the undefined term â€œpropertyâ€ appearing in \r\n  paragraph K and by reading â€œpropertyâ€ to include the common areas.Â  \r\nAlthough the circuit court noted the rental agreement contained no specific \r\n  language conferring third-party beneficiary rights upon Windsor Green, it found \r\n  that Windsor Green was nevertheless a third-party beneficiary to the contract \r\n  â€œsince Windsor Green is the entity which maintains and controls the ownership \r\n  interests of the common elementsâ€ and because Allied agreed to be financially \r\n  responsible for damage to the â€œpropertyâ€ caused by it or its guests, with the \r\n  term â€œpropertyâ€ encompassing the common elements.\r\nWe find the circuit court erred in its interpretation of the Horizontal Property \r\n  Act.Â  Section 27-31-120 does no more than make the lease of an individual condominium \r\n  unit serve to also lease the ownerâ€™s undivided interest in the common elements \r\n  to the lessee, whether or not use of the common elements is addressed in the \r\n  lease.Â  Thus, a lessee has the same right to use the common areas of the condominium \r\n  complex, such as the hallways, the stairways, etc., as has the owner.Â  \r\nIn any case, even if section 27-31-120 and the definition of â€œpropertyâ€ as \r\n  used in the Horizontal Property Act are applied to the rental agreement, nothing \r\n  in the language of the contract itself implies any contractual duty on the part \r\n  of Allied to be liable for damage to anyone other than to J.B. Allen Real Estate \r\n  on behalf of the owners, the Reitzels.Â  No third-party beneficiary status is \r\n  created absent an intent by the parties to confer a substantial benefit on Windsor \r\n  Green.Â  Since we find no evidence of an intent to benefit Windsor Green, we \r\n  hold the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Windsor Green on \r\n  its claim for breach of contract. \r\nAs an alternative sustaining ground, the circuit court further ruled that, \r\n  while Windsor Green was not specifically mentioned in the rental agreement, \r\n  a condominium owner and a lessee cannot enter into a lease for the conveyance \r\n  of a leasehold interest without also creating reciprocal contractual duties \r\n  and obligations between the homeownersâ€™ association and the lessee despite the \r\n  lack of privity.Â  Since the ownerâ€™s undivided interest in the common areas passes \r\n  with the lease pursuant to the Horizontal Property Act, any rights Windsor Green \r\n  would have to pursue a recovery from the owner for damages to the common areas \r\n  attach to the lessee by virtue of the lease agreement; therefore, the circuit \r\n  court reasoned, Windsor Green is a third-party beneficiary of the rental agreement \r\n  to the extent Allied assumed obligations of the owners with respect to damage \r\n  to the common areas. [2] Â  \r\nWe do not think a rental agreement between a condominium owner and the ownerâ€™s \r\n  tenant by which the tenant voluntarily agreed to pay the owner for any \r\n  property damage caused by the tenant, his family, or guests, goes so far as \r\n  to make the homeowners association a third-party beneficiary of the contract, \r\n  notwithstanding the fact that, by law, the tenant has the right to use the common \r\n  areas.Â  Under this rationale, a homeownersâ€™ association could directly hold \r\n  a tenant contractually responsible for assessments, association dues, or any \r\n  other expenses even though the parties did not intend this result by virtue \r\n  of entering into a rental agreement.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order granting summary judgment to Windsor Green \r\n  on its claim for breach of contract isÂ  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Honeywell International, Inc. is the successor corporation to Allied \r\n    Signal, Inc.Â  Where appropriate, a reference to Allied shall include Honeywell \r\n    International.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Â The circuit court based its \r\n    ruling on section 27-31-120 of the Horizontal Property Act, as well as the \r\n    supreme courtâ€™s decision in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Horizontal Property \r\n    Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998), while noting Davenport \r\n    was factually distinguishable.Â  \r\n  In Davenport, the \r\n    lessee sued the condominium association after he fell down a stairway at night \r\n    in an area where the lights were not working.Â  The supreme court cited its \r\n    earlier holding in Murphy v. Yacht Cove Homeowners Association, 289 \r\n    S.C. 367, 345 S.E.2d 709 (1986) that a member of a condominium association \r\n    may bring a tort action against the association for failing to properly maintain \r\n    the common elements.Â  The holding in Murphy coupled with section 27-31-120 \r\n    led the court to conclude that a lessee could bring an action in \r\n    tort against the property regime for its failure to maintain the common \r\n    areas.Â  Davenport, 333 S.C. at 88, 508 S.E.2d at 574.Â  The current \r\n    appeal does not involve a tort claim; rather, it concerns contractual liability.Â  \r\n    Consequently, we find Davenport inapposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3885","title":"Horry County State Bank v.

(Flemington/Boatworks) \r\n  have a common principal, Bill Bartus.Â  \r\nSometime in late 2001 or early 2002, Kenâ€™s Cabana entered \r\n  into a joint venture with Winnerâ€™s World, Inc. to operate a casino boat out \r\n  of the restaurant property.Â  In addition, Kenâ€™s Cabana was operating a lunch \r\n  business out of the restaurant earlier than 4:00 p.m.Â  Both of these actions \r\n  violated the terms of the easement. \r\nBased on these violations, Flemington/Boatworks terminated Kenâ€™s Cabanaâ€™s parking \r\n  easement by letter on January 29, 2002.Â  Subsequently, Flemington/Boatworks \r\n  posted restricted parking signs in the Marina parking lot.Â  Kenâ€™s Cabana, Winnerâ€™s \r\n  World, Inc., and Winnerâ€™s World Tours (collectively referred to as Kenâ€™s Cabana) \r\n  initiated this action on February 7, 2002 against Flemington/Boatworks, alleging \r\n  civil conspiracy, unfair trade practices, violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth \r\n  Amendments, inverse condemnation, and violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust and \r\n  Clayton Acts.Â  Flemington/Boatworks answered and counterclaimed seeking a declaratory \r\n  judgment affirming their termination of Kenâ€™s Cabanaâ€™s easement.Â  Flemington/Boatworks \r\n  then filed a motion for summary judgment which was heard on January 30, 2003. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Flemington/Boatworks \r\n  and filed an order to that effect on February 24, 2003.Â  Kenâ€™s Cabana filed \r\n  a motion to reconsider on March 5, 2003, and a hearing was set for May 27, 2003.Â  \r\n  The Bank first learned of the litigation on May 22, 2003.Â  It promptly filed \r\n  a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2), SCRCP, along with a motion \r\n  to set aside the summary judgment order.Â  The motion to reconsider and the Bankâ€™s \r\n  motions were heard together on May 27, 2003. The trial judge ruled from the \r\n  bench, denying all three motions.Â  The Bank appeals the denial of its motion \r\n  to intervene.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review for a Rule 24(a)(2) motion is whether the judge abused \r\n  his discretion in granting or denying the motion.Â  S.C. Tax Commâ€™n v. Union \r\n  County Treasurer, 295 S.C. 257, 260, 368 S.E.2d 72, 74 (Ct. App. 1988) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  â€œOn reviewing the trial judgeâ€™s decision as to whether adequacy of \r\n  representation exists, we must appraise all of the circumstances of a particular \r\n  case as to whether interests sufficiently overlap so as to deny intervention.â€Â  \r\n  Berkeley Electric Co-op., Inc. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 302 S.C. 186, \r\n  191, 394 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1990).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIntervention is a procedural device whereby a third party who is not a named \r\n  party in an existing lawsuit, but who has an interest in its outcome, may become \r\n  a party to the action.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 826 (7th ed. \r\n  1999).Â  Intervention may be of right or permissive; intervention of right is \r\n  governed by Rule 24(a), SCRCP, which is modeled after the federal rule.Â  Intervention \r\n  should be liberally granted, particularly where judicial economy will be promoted \r\n  by the declaration of rights of all parties who may be affected.Â  See \r\n  Berkeley Electric at 189, 394 S.E.2d at 714.Â  However, this does not \r\n  mean intervention should always be granted.Â  Instead, â€œwe must consider the \r\n  pragmatic consequences of a decision to permit or deny intervention and avoid \r\n  setting up rigid applications of Rule 24(a)(2).â€Â  Id.Â  â€œEach case will \r\n  be examined in the context of its unique facts and circumstances.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 24(a) provides:\r\n\r\nUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene \r\n  in an action: (1) when a statute confers an unconditional right to intervene; \r\n  or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction \r\n  which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition \r\n  of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect \r\n  that interest, unless the applicantâ€™s interest is adequately represented by \r\n  existing parties.Â  \r\n\r\nThus, a party seeking intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) must: (1) establish \r\n  timely application; (2) assert an interest relating to the property or transaction \r\n  which is the subject of the action; (3) demonstrate that it is in a position \r\n  such that without intervention, disposition of the action may impair or impede \r\n  its ability to protect that interest; and (4) demonstrate that its interest \r\n  is inadequately represented by other parties.Â  Ex Parte Reichlyn, 310 \r\n  S.C. 495, 427 S.E.2d 661 (1993).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe parties do not dispute that the Bank timely filed for intervention and \r\n  has an interest in the subject of the underlying action.Â  At issue is whether \r\n  Kenâ€™s Cabana adequately represented the Bankâ€™s rights. [1] Â  \r\nThe burden of demonstrating inadequacy of representation is on the applicant.Â  \r\n  Berkeley Electric at 191, 394 S.E.2d at 715.Â  This burden may be satisfied \r\n  by a showing that the representation of the applicantâ€™s interest â€œmay beâ€ inadequate.Â  \r\n  Id.

Watt, 713 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1983), \r\n  the leading case on intervention of right, the court articulated a set of factors \r\n  for determining when an absent partyâ€™s interest is adequately represented.Â  \r\n  The court considered â€œwhether the [existing party] will undoubtedly make all \r\n  of the intervenorâ€™s arguments, whether the [existing party] is capable of and \r\n  willing to make such arguments, and whether the intervenor offers a necessary \r\n  element to the proceedings that would be neglected.â€Â  Id. at 528 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  Subsequently, in Berkeley Electric, our supreme court adopted \r\n  the following Sagebrush factors for determining the adequacy of representation:\r\n\r\n(1) whether the existing parties will undoubtedly make all of the intervenorâ€™s \r\n  arguments; (2) whether the existing parties are capable and willing to make \r\n  such arguments; and (3) whether the intervenor offers different knowledge, experience, \r\n  or perspective on the proceedings that would otherwise be absent.Â  \r\n\r\nBerkeley Electric \r\n  at 191, 394 S.E.2d at 715.Â  We find the Bank has failed to demonstrate its interest \r\n  was not adequately represented by Kenâ€™s Cabana. \r\nThe trial judge found \r\n  that the Bankâ€™s interest was adequately represented because â€œKenâ€™s Cabana has \r\n  vigorously defended against the termination of the easement,â€ and the interests \r\n  of the Bank and Kenâ€™s Cabana were essentially the same.Â  On appeal, the Bank \r\n  offers nothing to convince us otherwise.Â  The Bank addresses no arguments or \r\n  defenses that were not made by Kenâ€™s Cabana and points to no unique knowledge, \r\n  experience, or perspective that the Bank could bring to the proceedings.Â  It \r\n  simply does not address the Sagebrush factors.\r\nInstead, the Bank asserts \r\n  Kenâ€™s Cabana â€œmay have different intentionsâ€ than the Bankâ€”i.e., Kenâ€™s Cabana \r\n  â€œmay desire to sell the restaurant or even declare bankruptcy,â€ whereas the \r\n  Bank is concerned with protecting its security interest.Â  While there is nothing \r\n  in the record to suggest Kenâ€™s Cabana is planning to sell the restaurant or \r\n  declare bankruptcy, even if there were, this argument fails to address whether \r\n  or not Kenâ€™s Cabana has adequately represented the Bankâ€™s interest in the easement.Â  \r\n  If representation could be shown inadequate by the mere possibility that two \r\n  parties could have different intentions, little would be left of the doctrine \r\n  of adequacy of representation.Â  \r\nCommentators have noted \r\n  that adequacy of representation cases generally fall into one of three categories.Â  \r\n  See 7C Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary K. Kane, Federal \r\n  Practice and Procedure Â§ 1909, at 318-49 (2d ed. 1986).Â  First are cases \r\n  where â€œthe interest of the absentee is not represented at allâ€ or where â€œall \r\n  existing parties are adverse to him.â€Â  Id. at 319.Â  In these situations \r\n  there is an obvious lack of adequate representation.Â  At the other extreme are \r\n  cases where â€œthe interest of the absentee is identical with that of one of the \r\n  existing parties or there is a party charged by law with representing the interest \r\n  of the absentee.â€Â  Id.Â  at 324.Â  Examples of this second category include \r\n  class actions and cases where an executor, administrator, trustee, or other \r\n  formal fiduciary represents the interest of the absent party.Â  Id.Â  In \r\n  between these two extremes is the third category consisting of situations where \r\n  â€œthe interests of the absentee, and of the party thought to represent him, are \r\n  different, though perhaps similar.â€Â  Id. at 346. The case sub \r\n  judice falls into this third category.Â  \r\nBy focusing on the possibility \r\n  that the Bank and Kenâ€™s Cabana might have different intentions, the Bank apparently \r\n  would limit the denial of intervention, if at all, to that second category of \r\n  cases where the interests of the parties are identical.Â  However, that is not \r\n  the law in South Carolina.Â  Instead, we avoid â€œsetting up rigid applications \r\n  of Rule 24(a)(2)â€ and take each case â€œin the context of its unique facts and \r\n  circumstances.â€Â  Berkeley Electric at 191, 394 S.E.2d at 715.Â  Adequacy \r\n  of representation is determined by the Sagebrush factors.Â  Essentially, \r\n  we look to â€œwhether the absentee is likely to have anything of his own to say \r\n  that will be of value.â€ See Wright &amp; Miller at 350.Â  The Bank points \r\n  to nothing additory or instructive it would bring to the dispute, but merely \r\n  reiterates that it has an interest.Â  \r\nThe crux of the underlying \r\n  case is whether Kenâ€™s Cabana will be able to continue to use the easement.Â  \r\n  The Bankâ€™s mortgage on the parking easement is only as good as Kenâ€™s Cabanaâ€™s \r\n  right to use it.Â  As the trial judge found, â€œThe rights and defenses of the \r\n  Bank rise and fall with the acts and omissions of their mortgagor, Kenâ€™s Cabana.â€Â  \r\n  They share the same interest and objective.Â Â Â  \r\nIn S.C. Tax Commâ€™n \r\n  v. Union County Treasurer, 295 S.C. 257, 368 S.E.2d 72 (Ct. App. 1988), \r\n  we affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of the South Carolina Tax Commissionâ€™s \r\n  application for intervention precisely because we were â€œunable to discern from \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s argument that its ultimate objective in th[e] case [was] different \r\n  from that of the Auditor and Treasurer.â€Â  Id. at 260-61, 368 S.E.2d 74.Â  \r\n  There, the underlying action arose when Milliken &amp; Company sued the Treasurer \r\n  and Auditor of Union County to collect over $87,000 in taxes paid under protest \r\n  to Union County.Â  The Tax Commission had exempted a Milliken manufacturing establishment \r\n  located in Union County from ad valorem taxes.Â  The Union County \r\n  Auditor and Treasurer levied a tax against Milliken that the county characterized \r\n  as a nonexempt municipal tax rather than an exempt county tax.Â  The trial judge \r\n  denied the South Carolina Tax Commissionâ€™s application for intervention.Â  In \r\n  affirming, we concluded: \r\n\r\nThe burden to show that the representation may be inadequate \r\n  is on the applicant.Â  3B J. Moore, Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Section 24.07[4] \r\n  (2d ed. 1987).Â  WHEN AN APPLICANT FOR INTERVENTION AND AN EXISTING PARTY \r\n  HAVE THE SAME INTERESTS OR ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IN THE LITIGATION A PRESUMPTION \r\n  ARISES THAT ITS INTERESTS ARE ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED AND THE APPLICATION SHOULD \r\n  BE DENIED UNLESS A SHOWING OF INADEQUATE REPRESENTATION IS MADE BY DEMONSTRATION \r\n  OF ADVERSITY OF INTEREST, COLLUSION, OR NONFEASANCE.Â  . . . [T]he County \r\n  Officersâ€™ objective was to retain the tax for the county and [the Commissionâ€™s] \r\n  objective is to have the court rule the tax was not a county tax from which \r\n  Millikenâ€™s property is exempt.Â  We see no difference of interest.\r\n. . . .\r\nThe Tax Commission has made no convincing showing the representation of its \r\n  interest may be inadequate.Â  It seems to argue the County Officersâ€™ interest \r\n  in a determination of the issue is local while its interest is statewide.Â  We \r\n  fail to appreciate this distinction in the context of this case.Â  Regardless \r\n  of how the partiesâ€™ interests are characterized, the Commission and the County \r\n  Officers seek the same outcome in the case.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 260-61, \r\n  368 S.E.2d at 74 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nSimilarly, we see no difference \r\n  of interest here.Â  Both Kenâ€™s Cabana and the Bank seek the same outcome in the \r\n  case: retention of the easement.Â  Kenâ€™s Cabana obviously wants to retain parking \r\n  for its customers, and it trenchantly contended against the easementâ€™s termination.Â  \r\n  The Bankâ€™s security interest in the easement exists only so long as Kenâ€™s Cabana \r\n  is allowed to use the easement.Â  Both parties want to preserve the easement \r\n  to enhance the value of the restaurant property.Â  Apodictically, the parties \r\n  seek the same outcome. \r\nBerkeley Electric \r\n  offers an instructive example of an intervenor satisfying the Sagebrush \r\n  adequacy of representation factors.Â  302 S.C. 186, 394 S.E.2d 712.Â  The underlying \r\n  lawsuit in Berkeley Electric arose when Berkeley Electric sued Mt. Pleasant \r\n  over the right to provide electrical services to a newly annexed area of the \r\n  town.Â  South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas (SCE &amp; G) moved to intervene, but \r\n  the trial judge denied its motion.Â  Our supreme court reversed, finding:\r\n\r\nSCE &amp; G has raised certain issues outside the existing pleadings.Â  \r\n  SCE &amp; G has also plead several special defenses to Berkeley Electricâ€™s complaint.Â  \r\n  Additionally, SCE &amp; G may be able to assert certain defenses that Mt. Pleasant \r\n  may or may not be able to raise.Â  SCE &amp; G also has the ability to bring \r\n  a different perspective or experience to the proceeding that would otherwise \r\n  be absent.Â  For example, SCE &amp; G has extensive experience in the area of \r\n  territorial service questions which arise after annexation.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 191-92, \r\n  394 S.E.2d at 715-16.Â  \r\nContrastively, the Bank \r\n  has failed to raise, argue, or even mention any defense not already asserted \r\n  by Kenâ€™s Cabana.Â  The Bank had no right to notice or right to cure upon breach \r\n  of the terms of the easement and thus has no independent grounds to defend the \r\n  termination of the easement.Â  The Bank does not point to any area of expertise \r\n  it could bring to address the termination of the easement.Â  It does not address \r\n  the Sagebrush factors at all.Â  \r\nThe Bank cites Thomasson \r\n  v. Ocean Point Golf, Inc., 300 S.C. 29, 386 S.E.2d 282 (Ct. App. 1989), \r\n  for support.Â  Thomasson involved a bankâ€™s intervention in a suit between \r\n  the lessor and lessee of a golf course.Â  The bank was the assignee of the lesseeâ€™s \r\n  right to receive dues from the Fripp Island Club.Â  A dispute arose between the \r\n  lessor and lessee of the golf course, and the lesseeâ€™s right to payment of dues \r\n  was one of the contended issues.Â  The trial judge allowed the bankâ€™s intervention, \r\n  and we affirmed, stating: \r\n\r\n[W]e find no abuse of discretion in this case. . . . Thomasson \r\n  makes no convincing argument that the disposition of the suit would not impair \r\n  or impede [the bank]â€™s ability to protect [its] interest, nor has it convinced \r\n  us that the bankâ€™s interest was adequately represented by other parties to the \r\n  suit.Â  We find no error in the order granting intervention.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 33, 386 \r\n  S.E.2d at 285.Â  \r\nIn this case the trial \r\n  judge found that the Bankâ€™s interest was competently and adequately represented.Â  \r\n  His order states that Kenâ€™s Cabana vigorously defended against termination of \r\n  the easement.Â  Further, the Bank has offered nothing to show that Kenâ€™s Cabanaâ€™s \r\n  representation was inadequate.Â  Therefore we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nCognizant that intervention \r\n  should be liberally granted, we come to the ineluctable conclusion that the \r\n  denial of the motion to intervene in this case was properly decided by the circuit \r\n  judge.Â  The Bank and Kenâ€™s Cabana share the same ultimate objective and seek \r\n  the same outcome.Â  Based on his fact-intensive review, the trial judge found \r\n  that adequate, competent, and dynamic representation of the Bankâ€™s interest \r\n  occurred.Â  Moreover, the Bank has proffered nothing pertinent to the Sagebrush \r\n  factors.Â  We find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the \r\n  Bankâ€™s motion to intervene.Â  Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because this case turns on adequacy of representation, we need not \r\n    address whether intervention is necessary to prevent the impairment or impediment \r\n    of the Bankâ€™s mortgage.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3886","title":"Estate of Roger D.

Prince [1]  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment \r\n  in favor of his attorney, John P. Gardner, Jr.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [2] \r\n\r\nFACTS \r\nIn May 1991, a Florence County jury convicted Prince of solicitation to commit \r\n  murder, conspiracy, and accessory before the fact of murder.Â  The trial \r\n  judge granted Princeâ€™s motion for a new trial as to the charge of accessory \r\n  before the fact of murder.Â  Prince appealed his convictions to the supreme \r\n  court.Â  The State appealed the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a new trial for the accessory \r\n  charge. \r\nIn addition to his two appellate attorneys, Prince retained Gardner for $25,000 \r\n  on March 1, 1993, to argue half of the oral argument before the supreme court.\r\nOn April 19, 1993, the supreme court heard oral arguments and considered Gardnerâ€™s \r\n  motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  The supreme \r\n  court issued an opinion on December 13, 1993, in which it affirmed Princeâ€™s \r\n  convictions, reversed the grant of a new trial as to the accessory charge, and \r\n  remanded the case for sentencing.Â  State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 447 \r\n  S.E.2d 177 (1993).\r\nOn February 4, 1994, Prince filed a petition for rehearing, a motion to stay \r\n  sentencing/remittitur, and a motion for a new trial based on after-discovered \r\n  evidence.Â  Prince paid Gardner an additional $7,500 to arrange a meeting \r\n  with Attorney General Travis Medlock to discuss the new trial motion.Â  Medlock \r\n  declined to re-open the case.\r\nDuring this time, Prince retained Jack Swerling to file a supplemental petition \r\n  for rehearing, a motion to stay sentencing/remittitur, and a motion for a new \r\n  trial.\r\nOn August 26, 1994, the supreme court denied the petition for rehearing and \r\n  the motion for a new trial.Â  On the same date, the court issued the remittitur.Â  \r\n  The next day, Prince was informed of the courtâ€™s decision.Â  Prince then \r\n  contacted Gardner and paid him $5,000 to arrange for his sentencing date to \r\n  be delayed until he completed his ongoing treatment for cancer.\r\nOn August 29, 1994, Gardner filed with the supreme court a motion to stay Princeâ€™s \r\n  sentencing date until Prince completed his cancer treatments on October 22, \r\n  1994.Â  Because the remittitur had been issued, the supreme court returned \r\n  the motion for lack of jurisdiction.Â  Upon discovering that his sentencing \r\n  date could not be delayed, Prince absconded for eleven months until he was apprehended. \r\n\r\nWhile incarcerated, Prince sent Gardner a letter on February 8, 1999, informing \r\n  Gardner that he intended to seek the return of the fees that had been paid.Â  \r\n  In the letter, Prince expressed his dissatisfaction with Gardnerâ€™s representation, \r\n  particularly his failure to obtain the favorable ruling that he had guaranteed.\r\nOn March 23, 1999, Prince filed an application for the resolution of the disputed \r\n  fees with the South Carolina Fee Disputes Board.Â  An assigned member issued \r\n  an opinion, finding the stated fee was â€œfair and equitable based upon all of \r\n  the surrounding facts and curcumstantces [sic].â€Â  Prince appealed this decision \r\n  to the full panel.Â  After a hearing, the Fee Dispute Hearing Panel issued its \r\n  decision on December 2, 1999, in which it found â€œthe fees charged by [Gardner] \r\n  were reasonable and the complaint is without merit.â€ \r\nSubsequently, Prince appealed the Panelâ€™s decision to the circuit court.Â  In \r\n  response, Gardner moved to dismiss the appeal on the following grounds:Â  (1) \r\n  Prince failed to properly serve the appeal; (2) the appeal was untimely; and \r\n  (3) the statute of limitations had expired prior to the filing of his claim \r\n  with the Fee Disputes Board.Â  Circuit Court Judge Edward Cottingham granted \r\n  Gardnerâ€™s motion and dismissed the appeal with prejudice. Â \r\nOn June 16, 2000, Prince filed suit against Gardner, alleging causes of action \r\n  for:Â  breach of contract; excessive fees/unjust enrichment; breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty; negligence; fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation; and intentional infliction \r\n  of emotional distress.Â  Gardner moved for summary judgment on the grounds:Â  \r\n  (1) the complaint failed to state a cause of action; (2) Princeâ€™s claims were \r\n  barred by the statute of limitations; and (3) Princeâ€™s claims were barred by \r\n  having submitted them to the Fee Disputes Board.\r\nAfter a hearing, Circuit Court Judge Sidney Floyd issued an order on February \r\n  23, 2001, granting summary judgment in favor of Gardner.Â  Judge Floyd primarily \r\n  granted the motion on the statute of limitations ground, finding Prince knew \r\n  or should have known that he had a cause of action against Gardner on or before \r\n  August 29, 1994.Â  He further held the cause of action for excessive fees was \r\n  barred by the previous resolution by the Fee Disputes Board.Â  Finally, he ruled \r\n  a cause of action for an attorneyâ€™s failure to achieve a guaranteed result is \r\n  not recognized in South Carolina.Â  See Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. v. \r\n  Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 26, 531 S.E.2d 282, 285 (2000) (holding no cause \r\n  of action exists in South Carolina for legal malpractice based on breach of \r\n  express warranty to obtain a specific result).\r\nOn March 16, 2001, Prince appealed the order to this court \r\n  [3]  and filed a motion for reconsideration in the circuit court.Â  After \r\n  a hearing on the motion for reconsideration, Circuit Court Judge John Milling \r\n  [4]  issued an order on July 23, 2001, in which he denied the motion on \r\n  the statute of limitations ground.\r\nOn November 26, 2001, Prince appealed this order and Judge Floydâ€™s order dated \r\n  February 23, 2001. [5] Â  On the \r\n  same day, Prince sent Judge Milling a letter in which he stated that Judge Floyd \r\n  had failed to rule on his motion to supplement his pleadings in response to \r\n  Gardnerâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nOn January 22, 2002, Judge Milling again denied Princeâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\n  He ruled that Princeâ€™s motion to supplement his pleadings was untimely.Â  He \r\n  further found that even if the motion had been timely, it did not provide a \r\n  basis to reverse Judge Floydâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of Gardner.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Prince appealed this order on February 26, 2002.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to \r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn \r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, \r\n  the evidence and all the inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Cunningham \r\n  v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 491, 575 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2003).\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies \r\n  the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  \r\n  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  Therefore, \r\n  on appeal from an order granting summary judgment, this court will review all \r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in \r\n  a light most favorable to the nonmoving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, \r\n  346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\nPrince argues the circuit \r\n  court [6]  erred in granting summary \r\n  judgment in favor of Gardner based on the statute of limitations.Â  He contends \r\n  the court erred in applying a subjective standard of the discovery rule.Â  Under \r\n  an objective standard, Prince asserts he was not neglectful of his rights.Â  \r\n  Because the purpose of the discovery rule is to guard against those who fail \r\n  to enforce their rights with reasonable diligence, he contends he should not \r\n  be precluded from pursuing the causes of action against Gardner. \r\n  [7] Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nActions for breach of \r\n  contract and personal injuries that arise after April 5, 1988, must be commenced \r\n  within three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1), (5) (Supp. 2003).Â  The discovery \r\n  rule, as outlined in section 15-3-535, provides that â€œthe statute of limitations \r\n  begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.Â  \r\n  The statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or should have \r\n  known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises \r\n  from the wrongful conduct.â€ Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 2003) (â€œExcept \r\n  as to actions initiated under Section 15-3-545, all actions initiated under \r\n  Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three years after the person knew \r\n  or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause \r\n  of action.â€); see Santee Portland Cement Co. v.

Glasscock, Jr., president \r\n  of Glasscock Company, Inc., a company which is also in the waste disposal business. \r\n  Â Mr. Glasscock thereafter began contacting council members, insisting \r\n  the proposed contract extension be put out for competitive bid.Â  However, because \r\n  Waste Managementâ€™s proposal, and particularly its terms, had been improperly \r\n  disclosed, County Council determined the competitive sealed bidding process \r\n  urged by Glasscock would be tainted and therefore was no longer feasible.Â Â  \r\n\r\nCouncil took up the matter of the Waste Management proposal at its next scheduled \r\n  meeting on April 10, 2001.Â  Several alternatives to the proposal were considered.Â  \r\n  After some debate, Council passed resolutions to amend the collection and transportation \r\n  contracts by, among other things, extending their terms as proposed by Waste \r\n  Management and agreeing to â€œsellâ€ its solid waste transfer station to Waste \r\n  Management. [1]   \r\nAt its next scheduled meeting on April 24, 2001, Council gave first reading \r\n  approval to two proposed ordinancesâ€”specifically, Ordinances 01-436 and 01-437â€”authorizing \r\n  the contract extensions that had been approved by resolution on April 10, 2001.Â  \r\n  Following second and third readings at the next two scheduled Council meetings \r\n  and a public hearing, the ordinances approving the contract amendments were \r\n  formally adopted on May 22, 2001.Â  The addenda to the Waste Management contracts \r\n  were subsequently executed. Â These contract extensions were an integral \r\n  part of the agreement to convey the transfer station to Waste Management.Â  Sumter \r\n  Countyâ€™s sale of the transfer station is not challenged on appeal.Â  Glasscock \r\n  seeks only the rescission of the contract extensions authorized by Ordinances \r\n  01-436 and 01-437.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW \r\nAn action for rescission of a contract is equitable in nature.Â  Brown v. \r\n  Greenwood School Dist. 50 Bd. of Trustees, 344 S.C. 522, 525, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  642, 643 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  While this court may review the record and make findings \r\n  based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence as provided in the \r\n  landmark case of Townes Associates v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, \r\n  86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976), the material facts in this case are undisputed.Â  \r\n  The issues before us on appeal concern only the legal question of whether the \r\n  County Councilâ€™s actions complied with local and state procurement laws.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Compliance with Sumter County Procurement Ordinance \r\nGlasscock first argues the referee erred in finding the County Council complied \r\n  with the Sumter County Procurement Ordinance \r\n  [2]  provisions governing the purchase of county service contracts.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nSection 2-221 of the Procurement Ordinance provides, in pertinent part, that \r\n  â€œcompetitive sealed bidding shall be used for all purchases . . . [w]here the \r\n  purchase price exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).â€ Â§ 2-221(1).Â  \r\n  Specifically exempted, however, from the competitive procurement requirements \r\n  are â€œ[c]ontracts that are specifically approved by a county ordinance.â€ Â§ 2-186(A)(1). \r\n  Â Â \r\nAs noted above, Ordinances 01-436 and 01-437 approving the \r\n  amendment of the Waste Management contracts were duly passed by County Council \r\n  in May 2001.Â  Glasscock claims, however, these ordinances were ineffective to \r\n  exempt the contract amendments from competitive bidding under section 2-186.Â  \r\n  He argues the contracts were effectively executed and binding upon the County \r\n  several weeks before the ordinances were passed when County Council passed its \r\n  initial resolution approving the contract amendments.Â  Therefore, according \r\n  to Glasscock, the contract amendments were void because they were not entered \r\n  into in strict compliance with the Procurement Ordinance.Â  Glasscock argues \r\n  the subsequent passage of Ordinances 01-436 and 01-437 was simply an attempted \r\n  remedial measure to imbue illegal contracts with the appearance of compliance \r\n  with the Procurement Ordinance.Â  \r\nIn support of his argument that it was the resolution and \r\n  not the ordinances that effectively bound the County, Glasscock places heavy \r\n  emphasis on the trial testimony of County Council member Rudy Singleton.Â  Singleton \r\n  testified that, based on his informal discussion with several other fellow council \r\n  members, he thought the Waste Management contract amendments were a â€œdone dealâ€ \r\n  when the resolution was passed on April 10, 2001. \r\nWe find this argument is without merit.Â  Glasscock misapprehends \r\n  the generally accepted function of resolutions as distinguished from ordinances \r\n  in the conduct of local government legislation.Â  Resolutions do not normally \r\n  have mandatory or binding effect.Â  Rather, the passage of resolutions is generally \r\n  considered to be merely directory.Â  See Central Realty Corp. v. Allison, \r\n  218 S.C. 435, 446, 63 S.E.2d 153, 158 (1951) (holding that â€œit seems to be well \r\n  settled that a resolution is not a law, and in substance there is no difference \r\n  between a resolution, order, and motionâ€); see also 56 Am Jur. \r\n  2d Municipal Corporations Â§ 296 (2000) (commenting that â€œan ordinance \r\n  is distinctively a legislative act, while a resolution may simply be an expression \r\n  of opinion or mind concerning some particular item of business coming within \r\n  the legislative bodyâ€™s official cognizance . . .â€); 62 C.J.S. Municipal \r\n  Corporations Â§ 247 (Supp. 2004) (commenting that â€œa resolution ordinarily \r\n  is an act of a special or temporary character, not prescribing a permanent rule \r\n  of government, but is merely declaratory of the will or opinion of a municipal \r\n  corporation in a given matter . . .â€).\r\nIt is clear here that the adoption of the resolution was \r\n  simply a first step in the process of County Councilâ€™s formal, public consideration \r\n  of the contract amendments.Â  As noted above, following the adoption of the resolution, \r\n  the contract amendments proposed by the resolution were given formal first, \r\n  second, and third readings at public County Council sessions followed by a public \r\n  hearing on the matter noticed several weeks in advance.Â  Indeed, in order to \r\n  carry out this public process, the Council and Waste Management needed to reach \r\n  at least a tentative understanding regarding the details of any contract amendments \r\n  that would ultimately be agreed upon.Â  Such an understanding was needed prior \r\n  to the period for public comment and hearings in order for specific ordinances \r\n  to begin their journey through the deliberative process.\r\nAccordingly, we concur with the refereeâ€™s ruling that County \r\n  Council complied with the applicable provisions of the Sumter County Procurement \r\n  Ordinance in adopting the contract amendments through the enactment of Ordinances \r\n  01-436 and 01-437.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Compliance with State \r\n  Statutory Procurement Law\r\nAlternatively, Glasscock contends that, even if County Councilâ€™s \r\n  adoption of the contract amendments complied with the requirements of the Sumter \r\n  County Procurement Ordinance, that Procurement Ordinance is contrary to and \r\n  preempted by applicable state procurement laws. \r\nSection 11-35-50 of the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement \r\n  Code provides that â€œ[a]ll political subdivisions of the State shall adopt ordinances \r\n  or procedures embodying sound principles of appropriately competitive procurement \r\n  no later than July 1, 1983.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-50 (Supp. 2003).Â  Glasscock \r\n  contends the Sumter County Procurement Ordinanceâ€™s exemption from competitive \r\n  bid requirements for contracts that are specifically approved by county ordinance \r\n  violates the mandate of section 11-35-50 and is therefore invalid.Â  As such, \r\n  Glasscock argues, County Councilâ€™s adoption of the contract amendments by enacting \r\n  Ordinances 01-436 and 01-437 violated the state procurement code.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nFirst, we note that section 11-35-50 does not impose a specific \r\n  requirement that all public procurement in our state be carried out by way of \r\n  a single, narrowly defined procedure.Â  While its mandate that all government \r\n  bodies adopt some form of competitive procurement procedures is unambiguous, \r\n  the statuteâ€™s broad directive that the processes chosen â€œembody[] sound principles \r\n  of appropriately competitive procurementâ€ clearly was intended to afford local \r\n  governments needed flexibility to determine what is â€œappropriately competitiveâ€ \r\n  in light of the public business they must transact.Â  \r\nThe state government, for exampleâ€”operating under the same \r\n  general approach prescribed by section 11-35-50â€”provides certain exceptions \r\n  to the competitive sealed bid rule for state purchases in its procurement code. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-710 (Supp. 2003).Â  We find no logic or consistency \r\n  in recognizing some flexibility at the state level while handcuffing local governments \r\n  with none. \r\nThat local governments should be afforded a reasonable degree \r\n  of latitude in devising their own individual procurement ordinances and procedures \r\n  is entirely consistent with our stateâ€™s now firmly rooted constitutional principle \r\n  of â€œhome rule.â€Â  By the ratification of Article VIII of our state constitution \r\n  in 1973, substantial responsibility for city and county affairs devolved from \r\n  the General Assembly to the individual local governments.Â  â€œ[I]mplicit in Article \r\n  VIII is the realization that different local governments have different problems \r\n  that require different solutions.â€ Hospitality Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. \r\n  County of Charleston, 320 S.C. 219, 230, 464 S.E.2d 113, 120 (1995); see \r\n  also Knight v. Salisbury, 262 S.C. 565, 571, 206 S.E.2d 875, 877 \r\n  (1974) (opining that the constitutional amendment providing for home rule was \r\n  â€œprompted by the feeling that Columbia should not be the seat of county government, \r\n  and that the General Assembly should devote its full attention to problems at \r\n  the state levelâ€).Â  In addition, Article VIII mandates that â€œall laws concerning \r\n  local government shall be liberally construed in their favor.â€Â  S.C. Const. \r\n  art. VIII, Â§ 17.Â  Coordinate with the principle of home rule, South Carolina \r\n  Code section 4-9-25 empowers counties to enact regulations, ordinances, and \r\n  other laws provided they are consistent with the general laws of our state. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-25 (Supp. 2003).\r\nGlasscock urges this Court to construe section 11-35-50 as \r\n  mandating sealed competitive bids in virtually every instance of public procurement.Â  \r\n  This approach would effectively strip our stateâ€™s local governments of any flexibility \r\n  in determining the competitive procurement policies and procedures appropriate \r\n  for them to adopt.Â  Indeed, such a reading of section 11-35-50 runs wholly contrary \r\n  to the home rule authority vested in local government by our constitution.Â  \r\n  We reject Glasscockâ€™s argument.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we do not intend to diminish \r\n  the vital role sealed bidding procurement procedures play in ensuring open, \r\n  accountable government.Â  To be sure, we recognize the general applicability \r\n  of competitive sealed bids under the Sumter County Procurement Ordinance.Â  In \r\n  the present case, however, we address only a narrow exception to that general \r\n  rule.Â  Whether a contract should be approved by ordinance and therefore exempt \r\n  from the sealed bid requirement is a function of County Councilâ€™s discretion, \r\n  the exercise of which they are accountable for as publicly elected officials.Â  \r\n  â€œIn reviewing the discretionary decision of a legislative body, our courts have \r\n  been loath to substitute their judgment for that of elected representatives. \r\n  Such decisions â€˜should not be upset on appeal unless [they are] arbitrary, unreasonable, \r\n  in obvious abuse of discretion, or in excess of lawfully delegated power.â€™â€ \r\n  Sloan v.

Georgetown County Council, 292 S.C. \r\n  235, 238-39, 355 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct.App.1987)).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons we conclude the contract amendments \r\n  at issue here were validly executed in accordance with the procedures prescribed \r\n  by the Sumter County Procurement Ordinance.Â  Furthermore, we hold that the exemption \r\n  from sealed competitive bidding provided for under the Sumter County Procurement \r\n  Ordinance is valid under our stateâ€™s mandate that all government bodies employ \r\n  appropriately competitive procurement procedures.Â  The order of the special \r\n  referee is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1]&nbsp; Although termed a â€œsale,â€ the then proposed conveyance of the transfer \r\n    station provided that title to the property would revert to the County in \r\n    the event Waste Management â€œceases to operate the transfer station at the \r\n    termination of the either of two existing contracts, or any extensions thereof, \r\n    either through the passage of time or default by [Waste Management] in its \r\n    performance of the two existing contracts . . . .â€Â  (footnote omitted). \r\n\r\n \r\n  [2]&nbsp; Sumter County Code Â§Â§ 2-171 to -268.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3888","title":"State v.

State, 354 S.C. 151, 155, 580 S.E.2d 120, 122 (2003).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€Â  State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 107, 572 S.E.2d 309, 311 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing State v. Brown, 351 S.C. 522, 570 S.E.2d 559 (2002)).\r\n  Section 56-5-2945 of the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part the following:\r\n  \r\n    (A) A person who, while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or the combination of alcohol and drugs, drives a vehicle and when driving does any act forbidden by law or neglects any duty imposed by law in the driving of the vehicle, which act or neglect proximately causes great bodily injury or death to a person other than himself, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction must be punished:\r\n    \r\n      (2)&nbsp;by a mandatory fine of not less than ten thousand one hundred dollars nor more than twenty-five thousand one hundred dollars and mandatory imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than twenty-five years when death results.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2945(A) &amp; (A)(2) (Supp. 2003).\r\n  The indictment alleged the following:\r\n  \r\n     That Allison L. Campbell did in Oconee County on or about April 10, 2002, drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both, and did an act forbidden by law and/or neglected a duty imposed by law, to wit:Â  a Motor Vehicle Accident caused by the Defendantâ€™s driving while under the influence of alcohol, which act and/or neglect proximately cuased [sic] the death of Kevin Tremain Shook in violation of Â§56-5-2945(A)(2)â€¦.\r\n  \r\n  (emphasis in original).\r\n  Campbell contends the indictment is fatally flawed because it â€œfails to allege an act forbidden by law or neglect of a duty imposed by law.â€Â  Specifically, she argues that although the indictment includes the statutory language â€œdid an act forbidden by law and/or neglected a duty imposed by law,â€ it fails to describe the specific act and/or neglected duty on which the State relied to support the felony D.U.I. charge.Â  \r\n  The general rule regarding the adequacy of an indictment is that â€œ[a]n indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 364, 580 S.E.2d 785, 791 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (citing State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987)).\r\n  An indictment is sufficient when it uses substantially the same language contained in the statute prohibiting the crime charged, or when it is described in such a way that the nature of the charge is plainly understood.Â  State v. Reddick, 348 S.C. 631, 635, 560 S.E.2d 441, 443 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When examining the sufficiency of an indictment, â€œthis court should â€˜look at the issue with a practical eye in view of the surrounding circumstances.â€™â€Â  State v. Barnett, 358 S.C. 199, 202, 594 S.E.2d 534, 535 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993)).Â  \r\n  Even a cursory reading of the indictment in the current case shows it contains virtually identical language to that contained in the statute defining the offense.Â  In addition, because Campbell pled guilty, it is clear she was aware of the nature of the charge against her.Â  A thorough review of the record discloses no indications of uncertainty in regard to the crime with which she was charged.Â  Accordingly, as the indictment adequately alleged the elements of the offense, we find the indictment was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court.Â  \r\n  Because we find the indictment sufficient, we need not address Campbellâ€™s remaining argument concerning double jeopardy.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive); Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œ[t]he appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in Record on Appealâ€).Â  \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3889","title":"Rimer v.

Rimer (Husband) and Kimberly V. Rimer (Wife) were married in 1977 and separated in 2002.Â  Citing irreconcilable differences, Husband brought the present action for separate maintenance and support.Â  The family court issued an order distributing the marital property, setting the terms of custody and support for the Rimersâ€™ minor child,[1] and awarding alimony to Wife.Â  The only issue raised in this appeal is whether the alimony award was excessive in light of the partiesâ€™ respective incomes and expenses.\r\n  The relevant facts concerning the Rimersâ€™ financial circumstances are as follows.Â  Husband has been employed by the same company, CSX Railroad, throughout the marriage.Â  With only a high school education, Husband worked his way up through the ranks at the railroad to a position of substantial responsibility as a mechanical superintendent.Â  This job has required that Husband work long hours and be available to travel to the railroadâ€™s various East Coast shop locations.Â  At the time of the final hearing, Husbandâ€™s reported gross income was approximately $7,000 per month.[2]\r\n  During the marriage, Wife was primarily occupied as a stay-at-home mother, raising the children and tending to the household affairs.Â  Like Husband, she too did not pursue education or training beyond high school.Â  Her work experience outside the home has been limited. Early in the marriage she was briefly employed as a bookkeeper and restaurant hostess.Â  More recently, she has worked part time as a substitute teacher at a local private school, earning approximately $266 per month.Â  The family court concluded, however, that Wife was underemployed, and found she was â€œcapable of at least minimum wage employment,â€ which, at the time, equaled approximately $900 income per month. \r\n  The family court granted Wife possession of the marital home.Â  Wifeâ€™s exclusive use and enjoyment of the house, however, was only to continue as long as the Rimersâ€™ minor son continued to live at home while finishing high school.Â  Once their son left for college (anticipated in fall of 2003), the court order required that the house be listed for sale at its appraised value and sold, with the equity to be split sixty percent to Husband and forty percent to Wife.[3]Â  In the interim, however, Wife assumed responsibility for paying all of the household bills, including the monthly mortgage payment.Â  \r\n  Bearing full financial responsibility for the home, Wife faced substantial monthly expenses.Â  The monthly mortgage payment alone was $1,046.Â  This payment and her other household and living expenses totaled $3,496 per month according to the estimates accepted by the family court.Â  Wife clearly could not make ends meet on her ownâ€”even assuming, as the family court did, she was capable of finding full-time, minimum wage employment. \r\n  The family court awarded Wife alimony of $2,600 per monthâ€”the amount necessary to cover the shortfall between the minimum wage income of $900 per month and Wifeâ€™s monthly expenses of nearly $3,500.Â  From this alimony award Husband now appeals.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  The amount of alimony is within the sound discretion of the family court judge and should not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown. Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975). An abuse of discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by an error of law, or where the order is based upon findings of fact lacking evidentiary support. Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Husband claims the family court abused its discretion in setting alimony at $2,600 per month, arguing the amount is excessive in light of Wifeâ€™s income potential and his ability to pay.Â  While a close question is presented, we conclude the award is within the broad discretion accorded the family court.\r\n  The purpose of an alimony award is to serve as a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital relationship, thereby placing the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage. Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516-17, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003). Alimony should not dissuade a spouse, to the extent possible, from becoming self-supporting. McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998). The family court has broad discretion in determining the amount of permanent alimony, and there is no single, fixed standard to use in making that determination. See, e.g., Graham v. Graham, 253 S.C. 486, 491, 171 S.E.2d 704, 707 (1970) (opining that â€œ[t]he amount of alimony . . . cannot be determined by any mathematical formula but is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial judge . . . â€).Â Â  All relevant factors must be considered and weighed by the court.Â  South Carolina Code section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2003) lists some of the factors a family court must consider when deciding whether and how much alimony to award, including, but not limited to: the duration of the marriage, the educational background of the parties, the employment history and earning potential of the parties, the standard of living established during the marriage, and the current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties. \r\n  In the present case, the nub of Husbandâ€™s argument is that the family court erred in its assessment of some of the critically relevant factors concerning the partiesâ€™ current and prospective financial situation.Â  Specifically, Husband asserts: (1) the court should have found Wife had greater earning potential than merely the minimum wage; (2) the court should have judged his ability to pay alimony based on his net monthly income rather than his gross income; and (3) the court should not have included among Wifeâ€™s expenses the monthly mortgage payment on the former marital home because of the homeâ€™s imminent, court-ordered sale.Â  We address each of these points separately below.\r\n  1.Â  Wifeâ€™s Earning Potential\r\n  Husband claims the family court arrived at an unrealistically low estimate of Wifeâ€™s prospective earning capacity.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\n   As described above, Wifeâ€™s training and work experience over the course of their twenty-five-year marriage were limited.Â  In recent years, she has only worked â€œonce or twice a monthâ€ as a substitute teacher.Â  Her last full-time employmentâ€”as a bookkeeper performing â€œgeneral office dutiesâ€ for a hotelâ€”was approximately twenty years ago.Â  Husband maintains this work experience should have translated, as of the date of the final hearing, into a higher-paying managerial or professional level job today.Â  We do not share his confidence.Â  The paper-driven back office of decades past has been largely replaced by computer-based management tools.Â  If Wife seriously desired to reenter that line of work, she would almost certainly need training in order to become competent in todayâ€™s technology-intensive office environment.Â  We do, however, recognize that Wife has considerable potential in the broader workforce.Â  In this regard, we agree with the family court judge who recognized that Wife â€œis an attractive, bright woman and although her education and training are limited, she is capable, at the age of 47, of getting a reasonable job or obtaining training or education to qualify her for even better employment.â€[4] \r\n  For these reasons, we cannot fault the family court for taking a less sanguine view of Wifeâ€™s employment prospects.Â  We find the court acted within its discretion by imputing only the minimum wage to Wife.\r\n  2.Â  Husbandâ€™s Income\r\n  Husband argues the family court should have considered only his net monthly income of $4,700 rather than his gross income of $7,000.Â  We find no error.Â  Included among the factors listed in section 20-3-130(C) that the family court â€œmust considerâ€ when determining the appropriate amount of alimony are â€œthe current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(6).Â  The statute makes no distinction between net and gross income, and no such distinction has been imposed by our courts.Â  While the family court judge referenced Husbandâ€™s gross income, a careful review of the record reveals that proper consideration was given to his net income.Â  The suggestion that the family court simply relied on Husbandâ€™s gross income without regard to his net pay finds no traction in this record.[5]Â Â  \r\n  Parties petitioning for alimony awards are, of course, free to argue that a spouseâ€™s earnings be calculated in any manner they think justified.Â  We leave it largely to the family court judgeâ€™s discretion, however, to determine what is appropriate in light of the circumstances of each individual case.Â  Formulaic principles and bright-line rules will only hinder the ability of family court judges to reach an equitable result in this individualized, fact-intensive area of law.[6]\r\n  3.Â  Sale of the Former Marital Home\r\n  Husband next argues the family court improperly determined Wifeâ€™s expenses.Â  He claims the court should not have included the $1,046 monthly mortgage payment for the former marital home among Wifeâ€™s expenses, arguing that obligation would be short-lived in light of the family court order that the home be sold in the fall of 2003 when their youngest son left for college.Â  While we agree the substantial mortgage payment was designed to be short-lived, the able family court judge properly declined Husbandâ€™s invitation to speculate as to Wifeâ€™s reasonable and necessary expenses following sale of the former marital residence.\r\n  While the sale of the former marital residence was certainly contemplated in the final decree, the ultimate effect of this change of circumstances could not have been ascertained at the time of the initial award.Â  Accordingly, it would have been inappropriate for the family court to follow Husbandâ€™s suggestion and speculate as to the effect of this event on Wifeâ€™s living situation and attendant expenses. We similarly decline to modify the alimony award based on purported changed circumstances associated with the sale of the former marital residence, for we find that such request must in the first instance be presented to the family court.[7]\r\n  This case illustrates well the competing tensions at stake when a family court judge initially rules on a matter which is modifiable upon a showing of a material change in circumstances.Â  Recognizing that the desired goal of finality is elusive in this area, our family court judges strive to recognize anticipated, foreseeable changes.Â  However, when the effect of anticipated changes is not readily ascertainable, it is inappropriate for the family court to speculate as to the effect of such anticipated changes. In such circumstances, as here, the family court should consider the effect of changed circumstances in the context of a modification action. \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  For these reasons, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in the alimony award to Wife.Â  The family court order is therefore \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  HEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] The parties have two children of the marriage, one of whom had already reached the age of eighteen at the time this action was initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2] This income figure does not include substantial bonuses which Husband received in some years, ranging from $12,000 to $16,000.Â  The family court did not consider the potential for bonuses in the alimony award.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [3] This court was informed at oral argument that the former marital residence was sold in 2003. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [4] It was disclosed at oral argument that Wife obtained employment as a flight attendant during the pendency of this appeal.Â  The issue of Wifeâ€™s current earnings and earning capacity is not before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [5] The alimony award here is not the result of a gross versus net income approach, but is primarily the result of two factors: (1) the award of exclusive possession of the former marital residence pending the partiesâ€™ youngest childâ€™s completion of high school; and (2) the family courtâ€™s assessment of Wifeâ€™s earnings and earning capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [6] Husband had been voluntarily paying pendente lite support of $2,700 monthly to Wife.Â  Wife urges this court to rely on this fact in affirming the award of permanent alimony of $2,600 per month.Â  To do so, however, would be ill-advised.Â  Family court litigants may well confront challenges at the onset of litigation which are not present if the case proceeds to trial.Â  For example, an offer of temporary support may be motivated by a desire to reconcile the marriage.Â  Moreover, the obligation to pay pendente lite support only continues during the pendency of the litigation prior to a final determination of the matter on its merits.Â  To assign weight to the amount of support awarded pendente lite or view the award as having any precedential value at the merits hearing or on appeal would discourage parties from amicably agreeing upon temporary support for fear the slightest concession would prejudice their position at the final hearing.Â  Temporary hearings are not de facto final hearings, and we adhere to the principle that temporary orders must be without prejudice to the rights of the parties at the final hearing. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [7] Indeed, our law allows a supporting spouse the right to petition the family court for a reduction in alimony based upon a showing of a material change in circumstances. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  Our ruling today does not in any way foreclose Husbandâ€™s right to pursue, as provided by law, a modification of the alimony award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3890","title":"State v.

[1] Â  We affirm. [2]   \r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the early \r\n  morning hours of August 7, 1999, the body of David Christopher Briggs was found \r\n  in a vacant lot in Florence.Â  The victim had multiple gunshot wounds.Â  Although \r\n  neighbors heard gunshots during the night, no one witnessed the shooting.Â  An \r\n  autopsy later revealed the victim had been shot at least seventeen times, which \r\n  caused him to bleed to death.Â  \r\nAfter receiving \r\n  information concerning a red Grand Am frequenting drug areas, narcotics officers \r\n  interviewed Dennis Rhodes, a confidential informant and the owner of the vehicle. \r\n  Â Rhodes told them that he had reason to believe that someone had been \r\n  killed in his car.Â  He stated that, on the morning of the murder, he loaned \r\n  his car to Broaddus.Â  According to Rhodes, the interior of the vehicle was covered \r\n  in blood and had bullet holes when Broaddus returned it.Â  Subsequently, the \r\n  investigating officers impounded and searched Rhodesâ€™s vehicle.Â  As part of \r\n  the continuing investigation, SLED analysis of the blood evidence confirmed \r\n  a DNA match with the victim.Â  Broaddus was ultimately apprehended in \r\n  New York where he was hospitalized as a result of another shooting incident.Â  \r\n  A Florence County grand jury later indicted Broaddus for murder and possession \r\n  of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nAt trial, the State \r\n  called Dennis Rhodes as a witness.Â  Prior to Rhodesâ€™s testimony, Broaddusâ€™s \r\n  counsel moved to exclude any mention of whether Broaddus was dealing drugs on \r\n  the night in question.Â  Specifically, counsel argued the evidence should not \r\n  be admitted as part of the res gestae of the charged crimes.Â  \r\n  He further contended the evidence would be far more prejudicial than probative \r\n  and should be excluded under Rule 403 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  \r\n  The judge admitted the evidence, finding Rhodes could describe the circumstances \r\n  of the night of the murder in order to give a full description of the events \r\n  that occurred that night, including an explanation of Rhodesâ€™s involvement with \r\n  Broaddus.Â  The judge concluded the testimony in question was part of the res \r\n  gestae of the crimes.\r\nRhodes testified \r\n  on the night of the murder he went to Tony Pickettâ€™s home where he met several \r\n  acquaintances including Broaddus.Â  According to Rhodes, everyone was drinking \r\n  and doing drugs that were supplied by Broaddus.Â  At one point during the evening, \r\n  Broaddus asked Rhodes if he could borrow his car.Â  Rhodes loaned his car to \r\n  Broaddus in exchange for cash or crack cocaine because Broaddus stated he needed \r\n  to make some phone calls and â€œsome deliveries.â€Â  Rhodes believed Broaddus was \r\n  going to make drug deliveries because he observed the supply of drugs in Broaddusâ€™s \r\n  hand.Â  Broaddus borrowed the car around 2:30 a.m. and returned it to Rhodes \r\n  at approximately 6:00 a.m.Â  When Rhodes opened the door to the vehicle, he noticed \r\n  blood and gunshot holes in the interior.Â  Rhodes testified that Broaddus apologized \r\n  for the condition of the vehicle and explained that his cousin had been shot \r\n  and he had taken him to the hospital.Â  Broaddus then gave Rhodes crack cocaine \r\n  while he and Pickett cleaned the vehicle.Â  The next day, Rhodes found a bullet \r\n  slug, as well as hair and scalp tissue on the passenger side of the vehicle.\r\nThe State offered \r\n  evidence regarding its theory about what might have precipitated the shooting.Â  \r\n  J.C. Newsome testified he sold Broaddus a CD player a week prior to the incident.Â  \r\n  When Broaddus inquired about the CD player, Newsome informed him that the victim \r\n  had it.Â  Newsome took Broaddus to the motel where the victim was staying, \r\n  but purposefully brought him to the wrong room when he discovered that Broaddus \r\n  had a gun and threatened to kill the victim.Â  Kelvin Lucas testified \r\n  he went to a bar with the victim on the night of the shooting.Â  During the evening, \r\n  the victim left the bar but returned within a short period of time.Â  Lucas testified \r\n  the victim seemed upset.Â  Around 4:30 a.m., the victim told Lucas that he had \r\n  â€œsomething to go take care ofâ€ and left the bar.Â  Lucas testified that he observed \r\n  the victim get into a car with Broaddus. \r\nThe jury convicted \r\n  Broaddus of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent \r\n  crime.Â  The judge sentenced him to forty years imprisonment for murder and a \r\n  concurrent, five-year term for possession of a weapon during the commission \r\n  of a violent crime.Â  Broaddus appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBroaddus asserts the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of drug use and \r\n  drug dealing as res gestae of the crimes.Â  He contends the evidence \r\n  was not necessary for the presentation of the Stateâ€™s case given the presence \r\n  of drugs did nothing to further the explanation for the blood and bullet holes \r\n  that were discovered in the borrowed vehicle.Â  He further argues the evidence \r\n  of drug dealing and drug use did not establish a motive for the murder.Â  Although \r\n  we agree with Broaddus that the admission of the evidence was improper, we find \r\n  any error in its admission was harmless. \r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.â€Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 \r\n  (2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is based \r\n  on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d \r\n  464, 467 (2000).Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe rationale underlying the res gestae theory is that evidence of other criminal \r\n  conduct that occurs contemporaneously with or is part and parcel of the crime \r\n  charged is considered part of the res gestae of that offense.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 462, 469 S.E.2d 49, 53 (1996).Â  â€œThe res \r\n  gestae theory recognizes evidence of other bad acts may be an integral \r\n  part of the crime with which the defendant is charged, or may be needed to aid \r\n  the fact finder in understanding the context in which the crime occurred.â€Â  \r\n  State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1999). Under res \r\n  gestae, evidence of other crimes is admissible:\r\n\r\nwhen such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crimeâ€ or is necessary \r\n  to a â€œfull presentationâ€ of the case, or is so intimately connected with and \r\n  explanatory of the crime charged against the defendant and is so much a part \r\n  of the setting of the case and its â€œenvironmentâ€ that its proof is appropriate \r\n  in order â€œto complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate \r\n  context or the â€˜res gestaeâ€™â€ or the â€œuncharged offense is â€˜so linked together \r\n  in point of time and circumstances with the crime charged that one cannot be \r\n  fully shown without proving the other . . .â€™ [and is thus] part of the res gestae \r\n  of the crime charged.â€Â  And where evidence is admissible to provide this â€œfull \r\n  presentationâ€ of the offense,â€ [t]here is no reason to fragmentize the event \r\n  under inquiryâ€ by suppressing parts of the â€œres gestae.â€Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 512-13, 514 S.E.2d at 582-83 (quoting State v. Adams, \r\n  322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (1996)).Â  \r\nOur appellate courts have found evidence of prior drug use to be inadmissible \r\n  as part of the res gestae where the record does not support any \r\n  relationship between the charged crime and the drug use.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  State v. Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 92-94, 480 S.E.2d 77, 79-80 (1997) (finding \r\n  co-defendantâ€™s testimony regarding prior crack cocaine use did not form a part \r\n  of the res gestae of burglary and grand larceny where there was \r\n  no evidence defendant and co-defendant had smoked crack cocaine immediately \r\n  prior to the burglary or that the prior acts were â€œso linked together in point \r\n  of time and circumstancesâ€ as to be required for a full presentation of the \r\n  Stateâ€™s case); State v. Smith, 309 S.C. 442, 446-47, 424 S.E.2d 496, \r\n  498-99 (1992) (holding evidence of defendantâ€™s prior drug use should have been \r\n  excluded where it was unrelated to the crimes of murder and armed robbery and \r\n  was not contemporaneous with the victimâ€™s murder); State v. Bolden, 303 \r\n  S.C. 41, 43, 398 S.E.2d 494, 494-95 (1990) (concluding evidence that defendant \r\n  was a social user of crack cocaine should have been excluded where evidence \r\n  was â€œnot essential to a full presentation of the Stateâ€™s case, nor was it so \r\n  intimately connected with the crimes charged that its introduction was appropriate \r\n  to complete the story of the crimeâ€). \r\nIf, however, the evidence of drug use is â€œinextricably intertwinedâ€ with the \r\n  crime at issue, our appellate courts have found it to be admissible.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71 (1996) \r\n  (concluding trial judge properly admitted evidence of defendantâ€™s cocaine use \r\n  prior to the robbery and murder where cocaine use, which precipitated the decision \r\n  to commit the robbery and murder, was in close â€œtemporal proximityâ€ to the crimes, \r\n  the cocaine use was part of the environment of the crimes and was inextricably \r\n  intertwined with the crimes); State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 461-63, \r\n  469 S.E.2d 49, 53-54 (1996) (finding evidence of crack cocaine sale between \r\n  defendant and victim several hours prior to the murder was a part of the res \r\n  gestae of the crime where evidence of earlier sale was necessary to show \r\n  why the victim sought out the defendant and to explain the specific circumstances \r\n  surrounding the encounter); State v. Gagum, 328 S.C. 560, 564-65, 492 \r\n  S.E.2d 822, 823-24 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding, in case involving strong-arm robbery \r\n  stemming from a purse snatching, evidence of defendantâ€™s offer of drugs to his \r\n  captors to obtain his release was admissible where the offering of the drugs \r\n  â€œâ€˜was so intimately connected with the crime charged that its introduction was \r\n  appropriate to complete the story of the crimeâ€™â€ (quoting Bolden, 303 \r\n  S.C. at 43, 398 S.E.2d at 495)).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn this case the testimony regarding Broaddusâ€™s drug use and drug dealing â€œwas \r\n  not essential to a full presentation of the Stateâ€™s case, nor was it so intimately \r\n  connected with the crimes charged that its introduction was appropriate to complete \r\n  the story of the crime.â€Â  Bolden, 303 S.C. at 43, 398 S.E.2d at 495.Â  \r\n  The testimony presented established that Broaddus threatened to kill the victim \r\n  because he stole the CD player that Broaddus purchased from Newsome.Â  Lucas \r\n  testified he observed the victim get into a car with Broaddus shortly before \r\n  the murder.Â  Rhodes testified that when Broaddus returned the vehicle it was \r\n  covered in blood and had bullet holes.Â  The decedentâ€™s blood was positively \r\n  matched to the evidence found in Rhodesâ€™s vehicle.Â  Thus, evidence of drug use \r\n  and drug dealing was not necessary for the Stateâ€™s presentation of its case.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the drug evidence was not inextricably intertwined with the crimes \r\n  charged given there was no evidence that Broaddus and the victim were involved \r\n  in any type of drug transaction.Â  Because the testimony did not form a part \r\n  of the res gestae of the crimes, the trial judge erred in admitting \r\n  the evidence.Â  Additionally, even assuming the testimony was relevant, its probative \r\n  value was outweighed by its unfair prejudice.Â  See Bolden, 303 \r\n  S.C. at 43, 398 S.E.2d at 495 (holding even if testimony under the res \r\n  gestae theory is relevant, its probative value must be weighed against \r\n  any unfair prejudice); Rule 403, SCRE (â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded \r\n  if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, \r\n  confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue \r\n  delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€).\r\nHowever, any error \r\n  in the admission of the evidence was harmless.Â  â€œError is harmless where it \r\n  could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€Â  State v. Adams, \r\n  354 S.C. 361, 380, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied \r\n  (Apr. 22, 2004).Â  When guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence \r\n  such that no other rational conclusion can be reached, this court should not \r\n  set aside a conviction because of errors not affecting the result.Â  Hill \r\n  v. State, 350 S.C. 465, 472, 567 S.E.2d 847, 851 (2002).Â  Newsome testified \r\n  that Broaddus threatened to kill the victim shortly before the murder.Â  Lucas \r\n  testified that he witnessed the victim get into a vehicle with Broaddus several \r\n  hours before the shooting.Â  Additionally, witnesses who were present when Broaddus \r\n  returned Rhodesâ€™s automobile testified concerning the condition of the car and \r\n  the presence of blood in the car.Â  The DNA from the blood in the car was a positive \r\n  match to the victim.Â  Furthermore, there is evidence that Broaddus absconded \r\n  to New York after the incident.Â  See State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. \r\n  196, 200, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996) (stating flight is â€œat least some evidenceâ€ \r\n  of defendantâ€™s guilt).Â  \r\nFurthermore, the \r\n  drug evidence is cumulative to other unobjected to testimony.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Van Purvis, who was present at Pickettâ€™s home, testified that Broaddus provided \r\n  the crack cocaine and intended to pay Rhodes with crack cocaine to borrow his \r\n  automobile.Â  Pickett also testified that Rhodes would be paid with crack cocaine \r\n  for lending his car to Broaddus.Â  See State v. Schumpert, \r\n  312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993) (stating that any error in admission \r\n  of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless); State \r\n  v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 499, 381 S.E.2d 732, 733 (1989) (â€œThe admission \r\n  of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the testimony \r\n  regarding drug use and drug dealing was not admissible as part of the res \r\n  gestae of the charged crimes.Â  We hold, however, that any error in its \r\n  admission was harmless.Â  Based on the foregoing, Broaddusâ€™s convictions and \r\n  sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  \r\n    Pursuant to Anders v.

Dâ€™Agostino, of York, for Appellant.\r\nLucy London McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In this domestic matter, Patricia \r\n  E. Deidun (Wife) appeals the family courtâ€™s final order, arguing the court erred \r\n  in: (1) defining a car as nonmarital property; (2) distributing the marital \r\n  assets and debts; (3) failing to award adequate alimony; and (4) failing to \r\n  award adequate attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Richard C. Deidun (Husband) were \r\n  married on April 23, 1977, and separated on December 17, 1999, when Husband \r\n  left the marital home.Â  The parties had a son during the marriage, born October \r\n  27, 1981.Â  Husband worked throughout the marriage, except for a seven-week period \r\n  in 1999 when he suffered from depression.Â Â  Wife also worked either part-time \r\n  or full-time jobs throughout the marriage, with the exception of two years after \r\n  the birth of their son.Â  Wife was the primary party responsible for caring for \r\n  the partiesâ€™ son, cleaning, cooking, buying the familyâ€™s food and clothes, and \r\n  handling the familyâ€™s finances.Â  \r\nThe parties lived in Michigan after they \r\n  were married.Â  In 1988, Husband accepted a position in Charlotte, North Carolina, \r\n  and the family moved there.Â  Husbandâ€™s North Carolina position paid him substantially \r\n  less than his former Michigan position.Â  The parties soon accumulated nearly \r\n  $33,000 in credit card debt, and Wife did not tell Husband about the debt.Â  \r\n  Husband discovered the marital debt in 1993, and he took control over the finances.Â  \r\n  The parties borrowed $28,000 from Wifeâ€™s father to pay off a portion of the \r\n  debt.Â  Two years later, Husband repaid Wifeâ€™s father for the loan, paid off \r\n  all of the partiesâ€™ other credit card debts, and reduced the family to one Wachovia \r\n  credit card which they both used.Â  At that time, Wife resumed responsibility \r\n  over the familyâ€™s finances. \r\nThe parties lived a comfortable lifestyle.Â  \r\n  They took vacations each year and enjoyed riding motorcycles.Â  Husband used \r\n  money inherited from his father to establish Putnam IRA accounts for himself \r\n  and Wife.Â  In 1996, the parties sold their Charlotte home, clearing nearly $80,000 \r\n  in equity from the sale.Â  The couple built a 3,400 square foot home in Fort \r\n  Mill, South Carolina, for $253,000.Â  The parties also took out a $25,000 line \r\n  of credit on their new home and used $19,000 to purchase a second motorcycle.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Husband suffered from depression \r\n  and he took leave from work.Â  While recovering, he cleaned up his old motorcycle, \r\n  sold it, and gave $9,200 to Wife to pay on the line of credit used to buy the \r\n  new motorcycle.Â  He was informed by Wife that there was still $25,000 owing \r\n  on the line of credit.Â  Because the parties only used $19,000 on the line of \r\n  credit to purchase the new motorcycle and they had been paying on the line of \r\n  credit for several years, Husband was surprised.Â  When he investigated the partiesâ€™ \r\n  financial status, he learned that the balance on the line of credit was actually \r\n  $31,000, not $25,000 as Wife had told him.Â  He also learned that Wife had withdrawn \r\n  and spent nearly $27,000 from her Putnam IRA account without disclosing it to \r\n  him, and Wife had incurred nearly $7,500 in credit card debt without his knowledge.Â  \r\n  Wife had also opened a Truliant credit union line of credit, with a balance \r\n  of $7,218, that Husband was not aware of.Â  The parties eventually separated \r\n  in December 1999 when Husband left the marital home.Â Â  \r\n After the parties separated in December \r\n  1999, they agreed to sell the marital home and Wife decided to build a new $172,000 \r\n  home for herself and the partiesâ€™ son.Â  Wife obtained several credit cards and \r\n  charged nearly $19,000 before the parties entered into a consent order in March \r\n  2000.Â  The March 6, 2000 temporary consent agreement provided that Husband would \r\n  pay: child support for the partiesâ€™ seventeen-year old son; $1,000 a month in \r\n  alimony to Wife; all the marital bills until Wife moved from the marital home; \r\n  $16,300 to pay off the balance due on Wifeâ€™s car; and $75,000 to Wife to assist \r\n  in closing on her new home.Â  Husband liquidated his Putnam IRA account, subject \r\n  to a substantial early withdrawal tax penalty, and gave Wife $75,000 to put \r\n  towards her new home and $16,300 to pay off the balance owed on her car.Â  Wife \r\n  used the funds to put $43,000 down on her new home and to pay off some of the \r\n  credit card debt.Â  The parties sold their home in September 2000 for $286,000.Â  \r\n\r\nAt some point, Husband started a relationship with \r\n  another woman.Â  Husband, his paramour, and the paramourâ€™s children eventually \r\n  moved to California when Husband accepted a job there in 2000.Â  Wife filed a \r\n  summons and complaint on September 18, 2000, seeking a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s \r\n  adultery.Â  On November 7, 2000, a second consent order was filed memorializing \r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreement that Husband could have $75,000 from the sale of the \r\n  partiesâ€™ house, with Husbandâ€™s attorney holding the remaining funds in trust.Â  \r\n  A third consent order was filed on December 13, 2000, in which Wife signed a \r\n  quit-claim deed to any home Husband purchased in California, a community property \r\n  state.Â  Husband voluntarily paid his sonâ€™s college tuition and purchased a car \r\n  for his son.Â  \r\nThis action was tried on July 11, 2001.Â  \r\n  After hearing testimony from Wife and Husband, the family court granted Wife \r\n  a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  The court also found that Wifeâ€™s failure \r\n  to handle the family finances responsibly and failure to inform Husband about \r\n  the status of their finances or her large expenditures amounted to a form of \r\n  misconduct that was a contributing factor to the breakup of the marriage.Â  The \r\n  court found Husbandâ€™s Corvette was not marital property and ordered the marital \r\n  assets be split with 65% going to Husband and 35% to Wife.Â  The court also divided \r\n  the marital debt, awarded Wife $1,200 per month in alimony, and awarded Wife \r\n  $2,570 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Finally, the court ordered a qualified domestic \r\n  relations order to divide the marital portions of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts \r\n  on a 50/50 basis.Â  \r\nAfter Wife filed a motion to reconsider, the family \r\n  court issued a supplemental order, finding that: (1) Wife was not fiscally responsible \r\n  and would likely spend beyond her means, regardless of the size of award she \r\n  were to be given by the family court; (2) Husband voluntarily paid for the sonâ€™s \r\n  college expenses; and (3) Wifeâ€™s expenses cited to support her claim for additional \r\n  alimony appeared to be inflated by debt service on additional borrowing and \r\n  appeared excessive in light of Wifeâ€™s receipt of $75,000 from Husband during \r\n  their separation.Â  The court noted that its original order actually failed to \r\n  allocate marital assets 65/35 in favor of Husband, so the court ordered that \r\n  Husbandâ€™s attorney distribute the entire $10,240 in funds remaining from the \r\n  sale of the partiesâ€™ home to Wife.Â  The court refused to alter the original \r\n  order further.Â  Although the court intended to divide the non-pension assets \r\n  on a 65/35 basis, the distribution after the supplemental order amounted to \r\n  an approximately 59/41 allocation.\r\nWife timely appealed the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order.Â  Husband filed a motion before this court to remand the matter when he \r\n  learned that his taxes had been miscalculated and he owed an additional $10,002.60 \r\n  early withdrawal penalty on the Putnam IRA account he cashed in to pay Wife.Â  \r\n  This court granted the motion to remand on February 20, 2003, and Husband filed \r\n  a motion for relief from judgment before the family court pursuant to Rule 60, \r\n  SCRCP. [1] Â  The family court indicated at the hearing \r\n  that it would deny Husbandâ€™s motion, and the court refused to: grant him relief \r\n  from judgment; reopen the case; consider the additional $10,002.60 tax penalty \r\n  as marital debt; or redistribute the marital assets and debts.Â  However, the \r\n  May 9, 2003 written order granted Husbandâ€™s motion to the extent that the additional \r\n  $10,002.60 would be considered marital debt and Husband would be responsible \r\n  for the debt.Â  Wife appeals both the supplemental order and the order on Husbandâ€™s \r\n  Rule 60 motion.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this \r\n  court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, \r\n  204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, \r\n  require this court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson \r\n  v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither is \r\n  the court required to ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and \r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, \r\n  276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. NONMARITAL PROPERTY\r\nWife argues Husbandâ€™s Corvette was transmuted into \r\n  marital property during the marriage, and thus the family court erred in determining \r\n  that it was nonmarital property.Â  Alternatively, Wife asserts that she was entitled \r\n  to special equity from the increase in value of the Corvette during the marriage.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nProperty acquired prior to the marriage is generally \r\n  considered nonmarital.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2003).Â  Although \r\n  nonmarital property is generally not subject to equitable distribution, the \r\n  other spouse may be entitled to a special equity in the property.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(5) (Supp. 2003).Â  A spouse obtains an equitable interest in \r\n  improvements to property to which he or she has contributed, even if the property \r\n  is nonmarital.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 299, 372 S.E.2d 107, \r\n  113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nNonmarital property may be transmuted into marital \r\n  property.Â  In determining whether property has been transmuted, courts must \r\n  consider whether the property: (1) â€œbecomes so commingled with marital property \r\n  as to be untraceable;â€Â  (2) is titled jointly; or (3) â€œis utilized by the parties \r\n  in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent \r\n  by the parties to make it marital property.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 \r\n  S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001). Â â€œTransmutation is a matter \r\n  of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.â€Â  Id.Â  The burden \r\n  is on the spouse claiming transmutation to produce objective evidence that the \r\n  parties considered the property to be marital during the marriage.Â  Id.\r\nIt is undisputed that Husband purchased \r\n  his 1973 Corvette when it was new for $5,900, and he paid off the balance owing \r\n  on the car a year before the parties married.Â  Wife testified the Corvette was \r\n  Husbandâ€™sÂ  â€œprized possession,â€ and Husband described it as his â€œtoyâ€ and â€œweekend \r\n  pleasure vehicle.â€Â  With the exception of an eighteen-month period when it was \r\n  necessary for Husband to drive the car on a daily basis, the car was not regularly \r\n  used.Â  While the parties lived in Michigan, the Corvette was stored and not \r\n  insured during the winter months every year.Â  Husband primarily drove the Corvette, \r\n  although Wife occasionally drove it.Â  During the marriage, Husband maintained \r\n  the vehicle and made improvements to it including installing new calipers, a \r\n  stainless steel exhaust system, and new wheels, for a total cost of $1,500.Â  \r\n  At the time of the final hearing, the Corvette had increased in value to $15,000.Â  \r\n  The family court specifically held that the Corvette was the nonmarital property \r\n  of Husband.Â  \r\nDespite Wifeâ€™s argument that the car was at times used \r\n  during the marriage by both parties, the evidence indicates the car was more \r\n  of a pleasure vehicle and not necessary for transportation for the parties.Â  \r\n  Although the Corvette was maintained and insured during the marriage from the \r\n  partiesâ€™ joint account, to which both parties contributed, nothing indicates \r\n  the partiesâ€™ intentions that the Corvette change from nonmarital to marital \r\n  property.Â  Because this car was not used for the benefit of the marriage, we \r\n  find the car was not transmuted and agree with the family court that the Corvette \r\n  was Husbandâ€™s separate, nonmarital property.Â  \r\nFurther, there is no evidence in the record \r\n  to support Wifeâ€™s argument that she is entitled to special equity from the increase \r\n  in value of the Corvette.Â  Other than the money from the partiesâ€™ joint account, \r\n  Wife made no other contribution to the maintenance or improvements to the Corvette.Â  \r\n  The evidence in the record indicates that, other than routine maintenance, the \r\n  cost of improvements was only $1,500.Â  Accordingly, the evidence does not support \r\n  Wifeâ€™s argument that she is entitled to special equity in the vehicle.Â Â  \r\nII. EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION\r\nWife argues the distribution of the partiesâ€™ assets \r\n  and debts was not fair and equitable because the family court did not adequately \r\n  consider the statutory factors and erred in finding she was guilty of economic \r\n  misconduct.Â  Wife also asserts the family court erred in considering additional \r\n  evidence concerning tax liabilities pursuant to a Rule 60, SCRCP motion.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nA. Fairness of the Distribution\r\nWife argues the family court erred in: \r\n  (1) finding she committed â€œeconomic misconductâ€ which led to the dissolution \r\n  of the marriage; (2) awarding a 59/41 distribution; and (3) failing to adequately \r\n  consider all the statutory factors in dividing the martial assets and debts.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe apportionment of marital property \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bungener \r\n  v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Section \r\n  20-7-472 lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning \r\n  a marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003); Greene v. Greene, \r\n  351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  On appeal, this court \r\n  looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  If the end result is \r\n  equitable, it is irrelevant that the appellate court would have arrived at a \r\n  different apportionment.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nWife incurred $33,000 in credit card debt \r\n  without informing Husband prior to 1993, when Husband took control of the finances.Â  \r\n  After Wife regained responsibility for the family finances and without Husbandâ€™s \r\n  knowledge, she increased the partiesâ€™ $25,000 line of credit to $31,000; withdrew \r\n  nearly $27,000 from her Putnam IRA; incurred $7,500 in credit card debt; and \r\n  opened a new line of credit with a balance of $7,218.Â  Wife admitted at trial \r\n  that she hid her expenditures, the partiesâ€™ growing debt, and her withdrawal \r\n  from her Putnam IRA account from Husband.Â  Wife claimed she neglected to inform \r\n  Husband because he had a stressful job and he did not want to be bothered with \r\n  the financial details.Â  Wife claimed she always spent the money on family necessities, \r\n  including clothing, food, and other household debt.Â  Wife incurred additional \r\n  credit card debt between the partiesâ€™ separation in December 1999 and the March \r\n  2000 temporary consent order.Â  Wife testified that she incurred those debts \r\n  to pay for household expenses, including nearly $2,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  nearly $5,000 in Christmas gifts for their son, including ski equipment and \r\n  a $3,100 musical instrument.Â  Husband testified that Wifeâ€™s financial mismanagement \r\n  led to the breakup of the marriage.Â  \r\nCiting McDavid v. McDavid, 333 \r\n  S.C. 490, 511 S.E.2d 365 (1999), Wife complains that the family court erred \r\n  in finding her guilty of economic misconduct and in considering the economic \r\n  misconduct in the equitable distribution.Â  In McDavid, the husband used \r\n  $24,13.50 in marital funds to support his failing business during the marriage \r\n  without informing the wife.Â  The family court found the husbandâ€™s actions constituted \r\n  marital misconduct, and the court used that amount in adjusting downward the \r\n  husbandâ€™s share of the marital assets.Â  The supreme court affirmed this courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that the husbandâ€™s imprudent business decisions did not constitute marital \r\n  misconduct:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with [other jurisdictions], we hold poor business \r\n  decisions, in and of themselves, do not warrant a finding of marital â€œmisconduct,â€ \r\n  and that there must be some evidence of willful misconduct, bad faith, intention \r\n  to dissipate marital assets, or the like, before a court may alter the equitable \r\n  distribution award for such misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\nMcDavid, 333 S.C. at 496, 511 S.E.2d at 368 \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe find McDavid may be distinguished \r\n  from the present case.Â  Although there is nothing in the record to indicate \r\n  that Wife acted with any bad faith in her spending habits, we believe McDavid \r\n  is more applicable to cases involving business expenditures.Â  Wifeâ€™s depletion \r\n  of marital funds and increase of the marital debt in the present case were not \r\n  to support a failing business.Â  Accordingly, we find McDavid inapplicable \r\n  in the present case and the family courtâ€™s consideration of Wifeâ€™s failure to \r\n  appropriately manage the family finances was not error.Â  \r\nFurther, we find the evidence in the record \r\n  supports the courtâ€™s findings that Wifeâ€™s willful habit of spending irresponsibly \r\n  was one factor that led to the breakup of the marriage.Â  After Wife incurred \r\n  substantial marital debt and Husband paid it off, she again incurred substantial \r\n  debt and depleted funds from a marital IRA account, without informing Husband. \r\n  Â She admitted that she hid the mounting debts, expenditures, and a withdrawal \r\n  from the IRA from Husband.Â  Other than Wifeâ€™s testimony that she spent the money \r\n  on the family, there is nothing in the record to show actually what the money \r\n  was spent on.Â  Wifeâ€™s intentional, reckless spending habits, and the associated \r\n  debt, placed significant stress on the partiesâ€™ marriage and led to the breakup \r\n  of the marriage.Â  Her spending amounted to mismanagement of the family finances \r\n  and to economic misconduct.Â Â  \r\nFinally, we find the family court adequately \r\n  considered the statutory factors, including Wifeâ€™s financial misconduct, in \r\n  awarding a 59/41 division of the non-pension marital assets in favor of Husband.Â  \r\n  A family court must consider several factors in equitably dividing marital property, \r\n  including: (1) the length of the marriage and the ages of the parties; (2) the \r\n  martial misconduct of either party; (3) the value of the marital property; (4) \r\n  the income and earning potential of each spouse; (5) each partyâ€™s emotional \r\n  and physical health; (6) the need of a spouse for training to reach his or her \r\n  earning potential; (7) each partyâ€™s nonmarital property; (8) retirement benefits; \r\n  (9) awards of alimony; (10) whether the marital home should be awarded to one \r\n  spouse; (11) the tax consequences of a particular distribution; (12) the existence \r\n  of support obligations from prior marriage; (13) liens or encumbrances on marital \r\n  property and any debt; (14) child custody arrangements; and (15) any other relevant \r\n  factor the trial court enumerates in the order.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. \r\n  2003).\r\nAt the time of the final hearing, the parties had \r\n  been married twenty-two years and their only child was over the age of eighteen.Â  \r\n  Neither party had a college education, although Husbandâ€™s specialized skills \r\n  made him highly marketable in his field.Â  Wife was forty-five years old, employed \r\n  to her potential, earned approximately $2,300 per month, and was in relatively \r\n  good health.Â  Husband was forty-nine years old, employed to his potential, earned \r\n  approximately $81,212 per year, and was in relatively good health.Â  Wife had \r\n  $110,980.79 in non-pension marital assets in her possession, and Husband had \r\n  $175,495.96 in non-pension marital assets in his possession.Â  Husband earned \r\n  pension benefits at two of his jobs; one of the retirement accounts was earned \r\n  entirely during the marriage and 80% of the other account was earned during \r\n  the marriage.Â  The marital debts included a $34,967 tax penalty for Husbandâ€™s \r\n  early withdrawal from his Putnam IRA; $7,155.86 from Wifeâ€™s Truliant line of \r\n  credit; $8,767.18 on Wifeâ€™s Shade Platinum credit card; $10,117.87 on Wifeâ€™s \r\n  MBNA credit card; a $16,149.56 lien on Wifeâ€™s car; and $11,609 in tax liability \r\n  from Wifeâ€™s early withdrawal from her Putnam IRA.Â Â Â  \r\nThe evidence indicates that the family \r\n  court adequately considered all the statutory factors in equitably dividing \r\n  the marital assets and debts.Â  In addition to considering the above factors, \r\n  the court considered Husbandâ€™s adultery, Wifeâ€™s non-economic contributions to \r\n  the marriage, and Wifeâ€™s economic misconduct.Â  With the exception of the tax \r\n  liability incurred when Wife withdrew funds from her Putnam IRA, of which Husband \r\n  was ordered to pay 65%, the court ordered each party be responsible for their \r\n  own debt.Â  Out of a total marital debt of $88,766.47, Wife was ordered to pay \r\n  $46,253.62 or 52%.Â  In the supplemental order, the court awarded Wife $120,220.79 \r\n  of the total $296,716.75 in non-pension marital assets, or 41%.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the court granted Wife 50% of the marital portions of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts \r\n  when they vested.Â  Further, the parties admitted at the oral argument of this \r\n  case that considering the pension award would raise Wifeâ€™s percentage of the \r\n  marital estate above 41%. \r\nAlthough the parties in the present case had a \r\n  long marriage and each party contributed financially to the marriage, we find, \r\n  based on the factors considered by the family court, that the actual distribution \r\n  of assets and debts was equitable in this case.Â Â  \r\nB. Post-trial Evidence\r\nWife asserts that, upon remand from this \r\n  court, the family court erred in â€œreopening the case and accepting additional \r\n  evidenceâ€ regarding the tax penalty from the early withdrawal of Husbandâ€™s Putnam \r\n  IRA account.Â  We disagree.\r\nA circuit court may relieve a party from \r\n  a final judgment pursuant to Rule 60 (b)(1), SCRCP, where a party shows â€œthe \r\n  judgment or order was induced by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable \r\n  neglect.â€Â  Hillman v. Pinion ex. rel Estate of Hillman, 347 S.C. 253, \r\n  256, 554 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Relief from judgment under Rule 60, \r\n  SCRCP, rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the courtâ€™s \r\n  findings will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Thompson \r\n  v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1989).\r\nDuring the final hearing, Husband presented \r\n  two un-filed tax returns prepared by his accountant.Â  One showed his estimated \r\n  taxes had he not cashed out his Putnam IRA.Â  The second tax return showed he \r\n  owed $34,967 as an early withdrawal penalty for cashing out the Putnam IRA.Â  \r\n  The family court determined the early withdrawal penalty was a marital debt \r\n  and ordered Husband to pay the entire $34,967.Â Â  \r\nAfter this court remanded the appeal to the family \r\n  court, a hearing was held on Husbandâ€™s Rule 60, SCRCP, motion for relief from \r\n  judgment.Â  Husband alleged that his accountant had underestimated the tax penalty \r\n  for the early withdrawal from the Putnam IRA account, and he learned after the \r\n  final divorce hearing that he owed an additional $9,132 plus $870 in interest.Â  \r\n  He alleged the family court should consider this amount to be marital debt and \r\n  then recalculate the debt.Â  The family court indicated at the hearing that it \r\n  was not willing to alter the facts and it was denying the motion to reopen the \r\n  case and consider the additional penalty.Â  However, the court held in the written \r\n  order that: the additional taxes constituted newly-discovered evidence; the \r\n  prior evidence regarding the miscalculated tax penalty was submitted as a result \r\n  of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect; and the additional tax penalty \r\n  was marital debt of which Husband would be solely responsible.Â  The family courtâ€™s \r\n  consideration of the additional taxes as marital debt and award of them to Husband \r\n  lowered Wifeâ€™s award of marital debts from 52% to 47%.\r\nAlthough Wife complains that the family court \r\n  committed an error of law in granting Husbandâ€™s Rule 60, SCRCP, motion and considering \r\n  the additional debt, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  The court found that Husbandâ€™s \r\n  reliance on his accountantâ€™s figures was justified and the miscalculation was \r\n  the result of mistake or excusable neglect.Â  Further, the consideration and \r\n  award of the additional debt did not harm the Wife insofar as she was not required \r\n  to pay any of the additional debt.Â  Accordingly, we find no error with the family \r\n  courtâ€™s order granting Husbandâ€™s motion and awarding responsibility for the \r\n  additional debt to Husband.\r\nIII. ALIMONY\r\nWife argues the family \r\n  court erred in only awarding her $1,200 a month in alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of alimony \r\n  rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 \r\n  S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support that \r\n  is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  McElveen v. McElveen, \r\n  332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The purpose of alimony \r\n  is to place the supported spouse in the position he or she enjoyed during the \r\n  marriage.Â  Id.Â  However, alimony should not â€œserve as a disincentive \r\n  for spouses to improve their employment potential or to dissuade them from providing, \r\n  to the extent possible, for their own support.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nFactors to be considered in making \r\n  an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional \r\n  health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment \r\n  history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during \r\n  the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; \r\n  (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital \r\n  and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital \r\n  misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; \r\n  and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nAt the final divorce hearing, Wife submitted \r\n  a financial declaration showing expenses for herself and the partiesâ€™ grown \r\n  son of nearly $4,000 a month.Â  Included in the expenses was a monthly payment \r\n  on a $27,274 second mortgage on Wifeâ€™s new home; payment on a $9,278 line of \r\n  credit; and payments on two or more credit cards.Â  Also included as an expense \r\n  was a $375 monthly car payment.Â  Wife only earned $2,300 in monthly wages.Â  \r\n  By contrast, Husbandâ€™s financial declaration indicated he earned nearly $82,000 \r\n  a year.Â  \r\nIn the final divorce decree, the family \r\n  court considered the statutory factors for alimony.Â  In reviewing Wifeâ€™s expenses, \r\n  the court specifically held that it would not consider her expenses related \r\n  to servicing debt in calculating alimony and further found that her expenses \r\n  might be inflated.Â  Reviewing all the factors, the court awarded Wife $1,200 \r\n  in alimony.Â  In the supplemental order, the court refused to increase the alimony, \r\n  stating Wifeâ€™s monthly expenses â€œappear to be inflated by debt service on additional \r\n  borrowing, for a second mortgage and credit card expenditures, which appeared \r\n  to be excessiveâ€ in light of the substantial cash payout given to Wife by Husband.Â  \r\n  The court also noted that Wife â€œis not fiscally responsible and is likely to \r\n  spend beyond her means, regardless of the size of award she receives from this \r\n  court.â€Â Â  \r\nThe evidence supports the family courtâ€™s award.Â  \r\n  Both parties were working to their potential and neither suffered from ill health.Â  \r\n  Husband earned substantially more than Wife, and the family court found him \r\n  guilty of adultery.Â  Although Wife had large expenses, the expenses can predominantly \r\n  be attributed to credit card debt and debt on a second mortgage.Â  Wifeâ€™s past \r\n  spending habits is evidence of her lack of fiscal responsibility.Â  Considering \r\n  these factors, we find the $1,200 a month alimony award is appropriate.\r\nIV. ATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nWife argues the family court erred in \r\n  only awarding her $2,570 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court may order payment of \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to a party pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial court, and the award will not be reversed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 633-34, \r\n  576 S.E.2d 156, 167 (2003).Â  The family court should consider: the partiesâ€™ \r\n  ability to pay their own fee; the beneficial results obtained by counsel; the \r\n  financial conditions of the parties; and the effect of the fee on each partiesâ€™ \r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  812, 816 (1992).Â  To determine the amount of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the \r\n  court should consider: the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; \r\n  the time necessarily devoted to the case; counselâ€™s professional standing; the \r\n  contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary \r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, \r\n  161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nWife consulted several attorneys immediately \r\n  following the partiesâ€™ separation. Â She paid fees for representation during \r\n  the consent agreements totaling nearly $5,000.Â  Wife testified that she charged \r\n  $2,000 of these fees to her credit card, and the debt was distributed by the \r\n  court as marital debt.Â  She also incurred $990 in private investigator fees.Â  \r\n  After filing the underlying action for divorce, Wife paid her current counsel \r\n  $1,500 as a retainer fee.Â  Wifeâ€™s counsel submitted an affidavit for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to the family court showing that the retainer fee had been spent and Wife \r\n  owed an additional $2,540.75.Â  Wife requested the family court to award her \r\n  $11,560 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  After considering the Glasscock factors, \r\n  the court awarded her $2,570 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â  \r\nThe amount of fees awarded to Wife is \r\n  supported by the record.Â  Although Wife spent several thousands of dollars in \r\n  fees prior to the filing of the divorce action, the record shows she merely \r\n  consulted some attorneys and the other attorneys only represented her in consent \r\n  agreements.Â  Further, the $2,000 in credit card debt Wife used to pay legal \r\n  expenses was counted as marital debt and equitably distributed.Â  The family \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife the amount of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees that remained due to her final attorney.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court correctly held that Husbandâ€™s \r\n  Corvette was nonmarital property.Â  The evidence supports the family courtâ€™s \r\n  findings that Wife was guilty of economic misconduct that led to the dissolution \r\n  of the marriage.Â  The overall distribution of the marital assets was fair, and \r\n  the court did not abuse its discretion in granting Husbandâ€™s Rule 60, SCRCP, \r\n  motion to consider and distribute the additional tax penalty.Â  Finally, we find \r\n  no error with the courtâ€™s award of alimony or attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n  STILWELL, and SHORT, J.J., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  It is unclear when Husband filed this motion \r\n    in family court because the copy of this document contained in the record \r\n    is not dated.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3892","title":"Steele v.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3892\r\nSubmitted September 15, 2004 â€“ Filed \r\n  November 22, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nErnest Steele, of Bennettsville, pro se for Appellant.\r\nJohn Benjamin Aplin, and Tommy Evans, Jr., South Carolina \r\n  Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Ernest Steele appeals the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s denial of his petition for a writ of mandamus against Stephen Benjamin, \r\n  Director of the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services \r\n  (the Department).Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nSteele was convicted of murder in 1967 \r\n  and sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  At the time of his conviction, the law \r\n  provided that a person was entitled to review for parole after serving one-third \r\n  of his sentence.Â  See 1962 Code Â§ 55-611 (Supp. 1966) (noting that the \r\n  Parole Board may parole a prisoner serving a thirty year to life sentence if \r\n  he has served at least ten years); 1962 Code Â§ 55-611.1 (1962) (providing that \r\n  a prisoner is entitled to review for parole after he has served one-third of \r\n  his sentence).Â  The law did not specify how often an inmate who was denied parole \r\n  would receive review thereafter.Â  \r\nSteele was paroled in 1978.Â  Steeleâ€™s parole was \r\n  revoked in May 1987 for convictions in Tennessee for Possession with Intent \r\n  to Resell drugs and driving under the influence. \r\n  [2] Â  Steele was again granted parole one year later in July 1988.Â  Steele \r\n  violated his parole and it was revoked on February 9, 1994, due to another conviction \r\n  for Possession with Intent to Resell Heroin.Â  Steele was denied parole when \r\n  he next appeared before the Parole Board on May 24, 2000.Â  He was informed that \r\n  his next review by the Parole Board would be two years later, on August 12, \r\n  2002.Â  \r\nSteele filed an action in circuit court \r\n  for a writ of mandamus on December 4, 2000.Â  Steele alleged that he was eligible \r\n  for annual parole review when he first became eligible for parole and that application \r\n  of the statutorily required two-year review enacted in 1986 constituted an impermissible \r\n  ex post facto application of law.Â  He requested the circuit court mandate the \r\n  Department to apply the annual review in place at the time of his first parole.Â  \r\n  The Department moved to dismiss the action, or, alternatively, for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  The Department argued: (1) Steele had not met the requirements to acquire a \r\n  writ of mandamus; (2) he was only entitled to parole review every two years; \r\n  and (3) no ex post facto violation had occurred.Â  \r\nA hearing was held in the matter on February \r\n  27, 2003.Â  After Steele submitted Erwin v. State, Op. No. 93-MO-286 (S.C.S.Ct. \r\n  filed Aug. 20, 1993), [3]  the \r\n  circuit court requested the Department to consider whether granting Steele annual \r\n  parole review would be a viable option.Â  In a letter, the Department noted that \r\n  Erwin was a memorandum opinion.Â  The Department informed the circuit \r\n  court that: (1) Erwin had no precedential value; (2) because no law existed \r\n  at the time of Steeleâ€™s conviction regarding the timing of parole review after \r\n  a denial of parole, the Departmentâ€™s internal policy of review every two years \r\n  controlled; (3) Steele failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he \r\n  failed to seek review of the Parole Boardâ€™s decision through the Administrative \r\n  Law Judge Division (ALJD); and (4) if the Department allowed Steele annual review, \r\n  it would also have to allow annual review to the 3,000 other inmates similarly \r\n  situated, which would strain an â€œalready diminishing budget.â€Â  In support of \r\n  its position, the Department attached to its letter an undated, untitled copy \r\n  of a document, stating the document was a copy of the Departmentâ€™s parole investigation \r\n  policies at the time of Steeleâ€™s conviction.Â  The document stated that inmates \r\n  serving a thirty-year sentence or greater who were denied parole would have \r\n  a subsequent review for parole after twenty-four months.Â  \r\nAfter a subsequent hearing in the matter \r\n  was held on June 2, 2003, the circuit court issued an order denying Steeleâ€™s \r\n  request for mandamus. [4] Â  The court found that in allowing Steele parole \r\n  review every two years instead of every year, the Department was applying the \r\n  â€œlaw/rule/regulation in effect at the time Mr. Steele was sentenced.â€Â  Thus, \r\n  the court found no violation of the ex post facto clause.Â  The court did not \r\n  address whether Steele should have exhausted administrative remedies.Â  Steele \r\n  appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhether to issue a writ of mandamus lies within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court, and an appellate court will not overturn \r\n  that decision unless the trial court abuses its discretion.â€Â  Charleston \r\n  County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Commâ€™n, 336 S.C. 174, 179, \r\n  519 S.E.2d 567, 570 (1999).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion arises where the trial \r\n  judge was controlled by an error of law or where his order is based on factual \r\n  conclusions that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Tri-County Ice &amp; \r\n  Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).Â  \r\n  An appellate court will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court \r\n  on a mandamus petition if the trial courtâ€™s findings are supported by any reasonable \r\n  evidence.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. at 179-180, 519 S.E.2d at 570. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Department points out that Steele \r\n  failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and thus, Steele did not meet \r\n  all the requirements for a writ of mandamus. \r\n  [5] Â  Steele, however, argues the circuit court had jurisdiction over the \r\n  mandamus proceedings.Â  Thus, as an initial matter, we address whether the ALJD \r\n  had jurisdiction to hear Steeleâ€™s claim that the Department violated the ex \r\n  post facto clause when it denied him annual review of parole eligibility.Â  \r\nThe question of whether an inmate may \r\n  seek review of the Departmentâ€™s and the Department of Correctionâ€™s final decisions \r\n  under the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) was answered by \r\n  our supreme court in Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 \r\n  (2000).Â  The court held:\r\n\r\n[A]n inmate may seek review of Departmentâ€™s final decision \r\n  in an administrative matter under the APA.Â  Placing review of these cases within \r\n  the ambit of the APA will ensure that an inmate receives due process, which \r\n  consists of notice, a hearing, and judicial review.Â  It also will provide an \r\n  orderly and consistent framework for resolving such matters.Â  \r\n\r\nAl-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 369, 527 S.E.2d at \r\n  750.Â  The court emphasized that not all APA provisions apply to the internal \r\n  prison disciplinary or decision-making process: â€œâ€˜The requirements of procedural \r\n  due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendmentâ€™s protection of liberty and property.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Bd. \r\n  of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972)).Â  The court \r\n  also said that review of non-collateral or administrative matters, although \r\n  limited in scope, must be provided in some form, and the APA is the most obvious \r\n  and practical solution.Â  Id. at 373, 527 S.E.2d at 752.Â  \r\nEx post facto claims are non-collateral \r\n  matters.Â  Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 260, 531 S.E.2d 507, 509 (2000).Â  \r\n  In Jernigan, the appellant, like Steele, argued that the change from \r\n  annual parole eligibility review to biannual review violated the ex post facto \r\n  clause of the federal and state constitutions.Â  Jernigan brought his claim in \r\n  a PCR application in the circuit court. Â Our supreme court held that Jerniganâ€™s \r\n  ex post facto claim was non-collateral and had not received an APA review.Â  \r\n  The court held:Â  â€œAccordingly, as a non-collateral matter, petitionerâ€™s claim \r\n  should be remanded to the appropriate agency to allow it to make a final decision \r\n  on petitionerâ€™s claim.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Sullivan v. South Carolina Department \r\n  of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 586 S.E.2d 124 (2003), our supreme court held \r\n  that the only way that an ALJD can obtain subject matter jurisdiction is that \r\n  the claim must implicate a state created â€œliberty interest sufficient to trigger \r\n  procedural due process guarantees.â€Â  Sullivan, 355 S.C. at 443, 586 S.E.2d \r\n  at 127 (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557 (1972); Furtick \r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Probation, Parole, &amp; Pardon Servs., 352 S.C. 594, 598, \r\n  576 S.E.2d 146, 149 (2003); and Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 382, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  at 757)).Â  Sullivan seems to imply that a quantitative analysis of the \r\n  liberty interest must be conducted.Â  \r\nThe requirement of a liberty interest \r\n  as pronounced in Sullivan is not new.Â  It was recognized in Al-Shabazz, \r\n  postulated in Jernigan (citing Al-Shabazz), and directly addressed \r\n  in Furtick.Â  However, the quantification of the liberty interest was \r\n  central in Sullivan, yet, like some constitutional issues, it remained \r\n  nebulous.Â  Sullivan cited Furtick as an example of a sufficient \r\n  liberty interest required to seek due process in the ALJD.Â  Furtick found \r\n  â€œthe permanent denial of parole eligibility implicates a liberty \r\n  interest sufficient to require at least minimal due process.â€Â  Furtick, \r\n  352 S.C. at 598, 576 S.E.2d at 149.Â  \r\nThe use of the word permanent in \r\n  Sullivan and Furtick does not mean that there must be a permanent \r\n  denial of parole eligibility before a sufficient liberty interest is involved.Â  \r\n  It is merely one of the ways that a sufficient liberty interest may be involved.Â  \r\n  We must be mindful of the facts in Furtick.Â  Furtick actually had been \r\n  permanently denied parole eligibility.Â  Sullivan recognizes that Furtick \r\n  established that an inmate has a right to a ALJD review of an agencyâ€™s final \r\n  decision denying parole eligibility, but an inmate does not have a right to \r\n  a review of a denial of parole.Â  The distinction is that the review or consideration \r\n  for parole is a right granted by statute whereas parole is only a privilege.Â  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, Steele is not appealing \r\n  the denial of parole; he is appealing the Parole Boardâ€™s change in the time \r\n  frame in which it will review parole.Â  The question then becomes whether Steeleâ€™s \r\n  claim raises a sufficient liberty interest to trigger due process requirements.Â  \r\n  Jernigan is factually similar to the present case.Â  Jernigan, like Steele, \r\n  alleged that the change from annual parole eligibility review to biannual review \r\n  violated the ex post facto clause.Â  The Jernigan court held that the \r\n  change from annual parole eligibility review to biannual review produces a sufficient \r\n  risk of prolonging incarceration by one year and increasing the measure of punishment \r\n  attached to the covered crimes.Â  It is axiomatic that any period of incarceration \r\n  implicates a sufficient liberty interest to trigger due process requirements.Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, Steeleâ€™s claim was appropriate \r\n  for disposition under the APA and should have been reviewed by the ALJD.Â  Because \r\n  he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, Steeleâ€™s petition for a writ \r\n  of mandamus was appropriately denied.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSteeleâ€™s complaint that the Departmentâ€™s application \r\n  of biannual parole review to him constituted an ex post facto violation, potentially \r\n  lengthening the period of his incarceration by one year, implicated a liberty \r\n  interest.Â  Thus, Steele should have exhausted his administrative remedies by \r\n  bringing this action pursuant to the APA.Â  Because he failed to pursue this \r\n  matter through administrative means, his petition for a writ of mandamus was \r\n  appropriately dismissed.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of this \r\n  action is \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n  [6]   \r\n STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  In its brief, the Department alleges that Steeleâ€™s parole was revoked \r\n    in 1985.Â  However, a verification of Steeleâ€™s case history is included in \r\n    the record.Â  In that document, the Department of Corrections verified that \r\n    Steele re-entered the Department of Corrections in 1987.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  In Erwin v. State, Op. No. 93-MO-286 (S.C.S.Ct. filed Aug. \r\n    20, 1993), the appellant pled guilty in 1960, and the Department attempted \r\n    to apply to him the biannual parole review from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-645 \r\n    (Supp. 1989).Â  The court held the PCR court erred in finding that Erwin was \r\n    not suffering an ex post facto violation from the application of the biannual \r\n    review law enacted decades after his guilty plea.Â  Erwin, at 2.Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  The record does not contain a transcript of either \r\n    the February 27, 2003 or the June 2, 2003 hearings.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â  Although the circuit court did not address whether \r\n    Steele failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, the Department, as the \r\n    respondent in this matter, points to other sustaining grounds found in the \r\n    record.Â  Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, \r\n    526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â  Because we decide this issue on the additional sustaining ground \r\n    that Steele failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, we decline to address \r\n    Steeleâ€™s ex post facto claim.Â  See Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v.

Gess of Beaufort, \r\n  and Robert E. Austin, Jr., of Leesburg, Florida, for Appellant.\r\nDrew A. Laughlin and Gregory Milam Alford, both of \r\n  Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  This is an appeal from a \r\n  decision of the Town of Hilton Head Island to grant a building permit.Â  The \r\n  Townâ€™s Board of Zoning Appeals upheld the issuance of the permit, and, on appeal, \r\n  the circuit court affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  We also affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn September 2002, the Town of Hilton \r\n  Head Island issued a building permit for the construction of a single-family \r\n  home on Lot 18 at the corner of Dune Lane and Jacana Street within the Townâ€™s \r\n  corporate limits.Â  The permit was approved for a structure that was set back \r\n  twenty feet from Dune Lane and ten feet from Jacana Street.Â  Carolyn Songer \r\n  Austin, a neighboring property owner, believed the ten-foot setback on the Jacana \r\n  Street side of Lot 18 was improper, and that the new home should be set back \r\n  at least twenty feet from Jacana Street.Â  She subsequently filed an application \r\n  with the Townâ€™s Board of Zoning Appeals seeking rescission of that permit. \r\nAs part of the permitting process, the \r\n  Town must ensure the proposed home site is designed with the appropriate setback \r\n  distances from the street and neighboring property.Â  These setback requirements \r\n  are designed to preserve the aesthetic character of the surrounding neighborhood.Â  \r\n  As a general rule, the Townâ€™s Land Management Ordinance provides that single-family \r\n  homes must be set back at least twenty feet from the street, but notes:\r\n\r\nFor all corner lots, the 20 ft. \r\n  adjacent street setback may be reduced to 10 ft. on the side of the residence.Â  \r\n  The 20 ft. adjacent street setback shall apply to the street having the highest \r\n  number of average daily vehicle traffic (ADT) as determined by the Administrator.Â  \r\n  If both streets have equal ADT, the property owner may choose which street to \r\n  apply the 20 ft. adjacent street setback.Â  \r\n\r\nIn this case, it was determined there was no evidence that \r\n  either Dune Lane or Jacana Street had higher average daily traffic, so the decision \r\n  as to which street to apply the ten-foot setback was left to the property owner.Â  \r\n\r\nAustin disagreed.Â  She claimed Jacana Streetâ€”not \r\n  Dune Laneâ€”had more daily vehicle traffic, thereby requiring the new home on \r\n  Lot 18 be set back twenty feet from Jacana Street rather than Dune Lane.Â  The \r\n  Townâ€™s Planning Department examined the matter and determined â€œ[t]here is no \r\n  evidence that indicates that Jacana Street has a higher traffic volume than \r\n  Dune Lane,â€ and therefore concluded â€œthe application of a ten-foot setback to \r\n  [the Jacana Street] side of the property is correct.â€Â  After conducting a hearing, \r\n  the Board accepted the Planning Department determination and informed Austin \r\n  by letter that her request to rescind the building permit had been denied. \r\nAustin appealed the Boardâ€™s decision to the circuit \r\n  court.Â  Several months after filing her petition, Austin filed two motions with \r\n  the circuit court that are relevant to the present appeal: first, she filed \r\n  a motion to amend her petition to add two new grounds; and, second, she moved \r\n  to supplement the record on appeal to include an additional plat depicting Lot \r\n  18 and the surrounding property.Â  The circuit court denied both of these motions \r\n  and ultimately affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal, we apply the \r\n  same standard of review as the circuit court below: the findings of fact by \r\n  the Board shall be treated in the same manner as findings of fact by a jury, \r\n  and the court may not take additional evidence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2003); see also Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for \r\n  City of Beaufort, 346 S.C. 401, 405, 552 S.E.2d 42, 44&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  In reviewing the questions presented by the appeal, the court shall determine \r\n  only whether the decision of the Board is correct as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, â€œ[a] court will refrain from substituting its judgment for that \r\n  of the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with the decision.â€ Restaurant \r\n  Row Assocs. v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 216, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446 \r\n  (1999).Â  â€œHowever, a decision of a municipal zoning board will be overturned \r\n  if it is arbitrary, capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful purpose, \r\n  or if the board has abused its discretion.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAustin raises \r\n  five issues on appeal: She claims (1) the Board failed to set out its final \r\n  decision in writing as required by statute; (2) the circuit court applied the \r\n  wrong standard of review; (3) the circuit court improperly denied the motion \r\n  to amend the petition for appeal; (4) the circuit court improperly denied the \r\n  motion to supplement the record on appeal; and (5) the Board lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to issue its decision.Â  \r\n1.Â  The Boardâ€™s Final Decision\r\nAustin first argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding the Boardâ€™s decision to deny her application was properly issued \r\n  in writing as required by statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 6-29-800 requires \r\n  that â€œ[a]ll final decisions and orders of the board must be in writingâ€ and \r\n  that â€œ[a]ll findings of fact and conclusions of law must be separately stated \r\n  . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800(F) (Supp. 2003).Â  In the present case, the \r\n  Board informed Austin of its decision by letter dated December 9, 2002, from \r\n  the Townâ€™s Deputy Planning Director, David L. Recor.Â  In relevant part, the \r\n  letter advised Austin:\r\n\r\nPursuant to testimony in this \r\n  matter, the Board of Zoning Appeals concluded and made the following written \r\n  findings:\r\n  \r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  There is no evidence that indicates that Jacana Street has a higher traffic \r\n  volume than Dune Lane and therefore it was correct for the Department of Building \r\n  and Fire Codes to issue a building permit with a ten (10) foot setback on the \r\n  Jacana Street side of the affected property.\r\n  \r\nThe vote on the motion to uphold \r\n  the administrative determination was 5-1 and therefore the appeal request was \r\n  denied.\r\n\r\nAustin contends this letter does not satisfy the \r\n  statutory requirement that the Boardâ€™s decision be in writing with findings \r\n  of fact and conclusions of law separately stated.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\n  Though the statute does not specify the form the writing must take, it is well-settled \r\n  that courts reviewing the decisions of zoning boards and other administrative \r\n  agencies may look to written documents as well as records of proceedings as \r\n  sufficient formats for final decisions.Â  For example, in Vulcan Materials \r\n  Co. v. Greenville County Board of Zoning Appeals, 342 S.C. 480, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  892 (Ct. App. 2000), this court upheld a circuit court finding that a transcript \r\n  of a zoning board hearing constituted a sufficient final written decision.Â  \r\n  On the question of whether the transcript alone could satisfy the statutory \r\n  requirement of a written decision, the court opined that â€œ[g]enerally, the format \r\n  of a final decision is immaterial as long as the substance of the decision is \r\n  sufficiently detailed so as to allow a reviewing court to determine if the decision \r\n  is supported by the facts of the case.â€ Id. at 494, 536 S.E.2d at 899; \r\n  cf. Massey v. City of Greenville Bd. of Zoning Adjustments, 341 \r\n  S.C. 193, 201, 532 S.E.2d 885, 889 (Ct. App. 2000) (considering use of transcript \r\n  but rejecting in part because it was virtually indecipherable). \r\nIn the present case, the evidence considered by \r\n  the Board is clearly laid out in the transcript of the hearing.Â  Reading this \r\n  transcript together with the December 9, 2002, letter, therefore, provides sufficient \r\n  basis for a reviewing court to determine whether the decision was supported \r\n  by the facts of the case.Â  \r\nOur decision today, however, should not be interpreted \r\n  as an indication that state and municipal agencies need not follow the mandate \r\n  of section 6-29-800 and other statutory provisions requiring fully formed written \r\n  final decisions.Â  In the present case, the issue raised by Austin to the Board \r\n  was limited to the narrow factual question of determining which of the two streets \r\n  had a higher average traffic volume.Â  While an exhaustive written decision may \r\n  not be warranted when a narrow issue may be addressed succinctly by the Board, \r\n  further detail will surely be required in more complicated cases.Â  Indeed, thorough \r\n  written findings and determinations eliminate potential confusion and ensure \r\n  the will of the Board is accurately transmitted to the affected parties and \r\n  reviewing courts.\r\n2.Â  Standard of Review\r\nAustin next argues the circuit court applied \r\n  the wrong standard of review.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 6-29-840 prescribes \r\n  the standard of review a circuit court should apply when considering an appeal \r\n  from a local zoning board.Â  In pertinent part, the statute provides: â€œThe findings \r\n  of fact by the board of appeals must be treated in the same manner as a finding \r\n  of fact by a jury, and the court may not take additional evidence.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-840 (Supp. 2003).Â  It is well-settled that â€œthe factual findings \r\n  of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses that \r\n  there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.â€ \r\n  Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 \r\n  (1992) (emphasis added) (citing Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976)).Â  In the present case, the circuit court \r\n  articulated the standard of review in different terms, stating: â€œFactual findings \r\n  of the zoning board of adjustment must be affirmed by the circuit court if there \r\n  is any evidence to support them and if they are not influenced \r\n  by an error of law.â€ (emphasis added). \r\nThis variance in language is likely the \r\n  result of confusion that arose after the Legislature enacted an entirely new \r\n  statutory scheme for local planning and zoning in 1994 in which the standard \r\n  of review as set out under section 6-29-840 was adopted. \r\n  [1] Â  Prior to the enactment of the new statute, the standard of review \r\n  was phrased as an â€œany evidenceâ€ standardâ€”identical to that articulated by the \r\n  circuit court in the present case.Â  As quoted above, the current statute clearly \r\n  phrases the proper standard of review as a â€œno evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Austin argues \r\n  the failure of the circuit court to couch the standard of review in the precise \r\n  language of section 6-29-840 is a fatal error requiring reversal.Â  This argument \r\n  is without merit.\r\nWe discern no material difference between \r\n  the standard of review articulated by the circuit court and the standard prescribed \r\n  by section 6-29-840.Â  Looking carefully at the way the sentences are phrased \r\n  in the court order and the statute reveals that the distinction between them, \r\n  if any, is purely linguistic.Â  The circuit court phrases the standard positively: \r\n  The â€œfindings . . .Â  must be affirmed . . . if there \r\n  is any evidence to support them.â€ (emphasis added).Â  On the other hand, \r\n  section 6-29-840, by reference to the common law standard for reviewing a juryâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact, adopts a standard of review generally phrased in the negative: \r\n  The â€œfindings . . . will not be disturbed unless \r\n  a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably \r\n  supportsâ€ them. (emphasis added).Â  When these sentences are read as a whole, \r\n  therefore, it is clear there is no meaningful difference in the quantum of proof \r\n  required under the standard formulated by the circuit court and the standard \r\n  prescribed under the statute.\r\nWe have confronted this issue before in \r\n  Vulcan Materials Co. v. Greenville County Board of Zoning Appeals, 342 \r\n  S.C. 480, 536 S.E.2d 892 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In that case as in the present one, \r\n  the court was asked to determine whether the circuit court applied the correct \r\n  standard of review for an appeal of a zoning board decision when the lower court \r\n  set out the standard using the â€œany evidenceâ€ language rather than the â€œno evidenceâ€ \r\n  language.Â  After detailing the history of the enactment of the new statute and \r\n  the confusion it has caused regarding the proper standard of review, the court \r\n  reached the same conclusion we do today:\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly held that \r\n  the old statute, Â§ 6-7-780, imposed an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of review . . \r\n  . .Â  The new statute, Â§ 6-29-840, is also very deferential to a boardâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact as it equates them to a juryâ€™s findings. . . .Â  The distinction, if \r\n  any, between an â€œany evidenceâ€ and a â€œno evidenceâ€ standard is of little importance \r\n  to the instant action . . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 488, 536 S.E.2d at 896.\r\nWe therefore find the standards of review \r\n  set out by the circuit court and prescribed under section 6-29-840 are functionally \r\n  equivalent.Â  Austinâ€™s argument to the contrary is unpersuasive.\r\n3.Â  Motion to Amend \r\nAustin next argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in denying her motion to amend the petition to state additional grounds for \r\n  her appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe procedures governing appeals of Board \r\n  decisions to the circuit court are prescribed by statute.Â  Section 6-29-820 \r\n  requires that the aggrieved party must file a written petition with the clerk \r\n  of court â€œsetting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is contrary \r\n  to law.â€Â  Furthermore, this petition â€œmust be filed within thirty days after \r\n  the decision of the board is mailed.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-820 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  The statute makes no provision for amendment of the grounds set forth in the \r\n  petition.\r\nAustin, however, argues the circuit court \r\n  should have freely allowed amendments to the petition.Â  Analogizing to the lenient \r\n  notice pleading regime of our Rules of Civil Procedure, Austin asserts that \r\n  parties should have the same latitude to amend petitions appealing a Board decision \r\n  as they would when seeking to amend any pleading in a civil trial court.Â  This \r\n  argument misapprehends the function of the circuit court in this case.Â  When \r\n  reviewing a Board decision, the circuit court sits as an appellate court.Â  Its \r\n  review is strictly limited to the facts and arguments raised to the Board below.Â  \r\n  Indeed, the circuit court is expressly forbidden from considering any new facts. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840(A) (providing the circuit court â€œmay not \r\n  take additional evidenceâ€).Â  This is a stark contrast to the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  role in its original jurisdiction as a fact finder.Â  There, the Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure recognize the reality of the pre-trial and trial process that facts \r\n  uncovered during the course of ongoing discovery and presentation of evidence \r\n  necessitate that amendments to initial pleadings be freely allowed in order \r\n  to conform to newly garnered facts.Â  See, e.g., Rule 15, SCRCP \r\n  (providing that leave to amend pleadings â€œshall be freely given when justice \r\n  so requires and does not prejudice any other partyâ€).Â  Therefore, it would be \r\n  error for the circuit court to adhere to the rules designed to govern the conduct \r\n  of civil trial litigation when sitting in its appellate capacity.\r\nOur supreme court reached a similar conclusion \r\n  in Smith v. South Carolina Department of Social Services, 284 S.C. 469, \r\n  327 S.E.2d 348 (1985).Â  In that case, the appellant filed a petition in the \r\n  circuit court for review of a final decision issued in a contested case before \r\n  DSS.Â  As in the present case, the procedure for seeking judicial review of the \r\n  DSS decision was governed by statute mandating the petition for appeal be filed \r\n  within 30 days of the Departmentâ€™s decision. Id. at 471, 327 S.E.2d at \r\n  349.Â  The circuit court dismissed the appeal because the petition failed to \r\n  specify an error, and it refused to consider the appellantâ€™s motion to amend \r\n  the petition after the thirty day filing period had expired. Id.Â  In \r\n  upholding the circuit courtâ€™s decision, the supreme court rejected the appellantâ€™s \r\n  argument that her motion to amend should have been freely granted, opining: \r\n  â€œThe appellant contends that the circuit judge erred in failing to consider \r\n  her Motion to Amend. She relies on the policy of liberally allowing amendments \r\n  to pleadings. We disagree. This policy does not apply to amendments made after \r\n  expiration of the thirty-day statutory period for filing the appeal.â€ Id.\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court \r\n  correctly refused Austinâ€™s request to amend the petition after the expiration \r\n  of 30-day period for filing the appeal.\r\n4.Â  Motion to Supplement the Record\r\nAustin next argues the circuit court erred \r\n  by denying her motion to supplement the record with an additional plat.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nAs noted in the discussion above, the \r\n  scope of review for a circuit court reviewing the decision of the Board is strictly \r\n  proscribed by statute.Â  Section 6-29-840 states:\r\n\r\nThe findings of fact by the board \r\n  of appeals must be treated in the same manner as a finding of fact by a jury, \r\n  and the court may not take additional evidence. In the event the judge determines \r\n  that the certified record is insufficient for review, the matter may be remanded \r\n  to the zoning board of appeals for rehearing.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2003).\r\nAustin maintains the plat was admitted into evidence \r\n  at the hearing before the Board, but that the Board, nevertheless, failed to \r\n  include the plat in the record on appeal. [2] Â  In support of her argument that \r\n  the plat was considered by the Board, Austin draws our attention to the transcript \r\n  of the Board hearing where the plat in question was mentioned.Â  Specifically, \r\n  a zoning board member asked a member of the Townâ€™s Planning Staff whether she \r\n  provided the Board a copy of a plat she had just referenced in describing the \r\n  setback requirements in the area surrounding Lot 18.Â  The staff member replied \r\n  that the plat had not been given to the Board.Â  After canvassing the entire \r\n  transcript of the hearing, we cannot discern from this fleeting reference sufficient \r\n  indication that the additional plat was introduced into the record or that the \r\n  zoning board relied upon it.Â  Moreover, we are bolstered in this view by the \r\n  fact that another plat depicting the area surrounding Lot 18 was expressly relied \r\n  upon by the Board and included in the record on appeal.Â  \r\nThe circuit court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in refusing to supplement the record based solely on the briefest mention of \r\n  an additional plat during the Board hearing.\r\n5.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \r\nFinally, we address Austinâ€™s argument \r\n  that the Board was without subject matter jurisdiction to uphold the issuance \r\n  of the building permit.Â  We find this claim is without merit.\r\nAustin asserts that the Boardâ€™s action \r\n  upholding the building permit effectively â€œalteredâ€ Jacana Street, an action \r\n  Austin maintains was in excess of the Boardâ€™s statutorily prescribed authority. \r\n  [3] Â  This allegation stems from some questions raised at the Board hearing \r\n  concerning whether the portion of Jacana Street that dead-ends into a pedestrian \r\n  beach access had been classified as a â€œstreetâ€ or â€œpark.â€Â  Homes built on private \r\n  property abutting areas set aside as â€œparksâ€ under the Townâ€™s Land Management \r\n  Ordinance need only be set back a minimum of five feet rather than the ten and \r\n  twenty feet setback distances applicable for streets.\r\nIn this case, the issue of whether the \r\n  Board â€œclassified,â€ â€œaltered,â€ or otherwise viewed any part of Jacana Street \r\n  as a park is of no consequence to any issue raised in her appeal.Â  Austin invoked \r\n  the jurisdiction of the Board to address the narrow question of whether the \r\n  Town erred in issuing the building permit based on her contention that Jacana \r\n  Street had a higher average daily traffic volume than Dune Lane.Â  The Boardâ€™s \r\n  ruling only answered this question and did not in any way touch upon whether \r\n  a portion of Jacana Street was classified as a park, for the Board authorizedâ€”consistent \r\n  with the applicationâ€”a ten-foot setback along Jacana Street, not a five-foot \r\n  setback. [4]   \r\nThis issue, and the confusion from which \r\n  it arises, illustrates the Legislatureâ€™s wisdom in requiring that boards of \r\n  zoning appeals reduce their findings and conclusions to writing.Â  Had the Board \r\n  in this case prepared a detailed order or memorandum outlining its decision, \r\n  the extent and effect of the Boardâ€™s action would not be called into question. \r\n  Nevertheless, we find the Boardâ€™s decision to uphold the building permit did \r\n  not exceed the bounds of its statutory authority.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of \r\n  the circuit court upholding the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals to permit \r\n  a twenty-foot setback along Dune Lane and a ten-foot setback along Jacana Street \r\n  is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â  \r\n    [1] See 1994 S.C.

Belser, Jr., and Michael J. Polk, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nRobert C. Brown, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: This action originated after \r\n  an insurance company denied a beneficiaryâ€™s claim for proceeds from a life insurance \r\n  policy.Â  The beneficiary sued the insurance company for breach of contract and \r\n  moved in limine to exclude evidence regarding the decedentâ€™s medical \r\n  condition.Â  The trial court denied the motion and found for the insurance company.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts of this case are not in dispute.Â  On \r\n  August 19, 1996, Carolyn Myers Metz (â€œDecedentâ€) applied for and received a \r\n  life insurance policy from National States Insurance Company (â€œInsurance Companyâ€). \r\n  In August 1998, her policy lapsed due to nonpayment. In October 1998, Decedent \r\n  applied for, and was granted, reinstatement of the policy.Â  On July 28, 1999, \r\n  Decedent passed away. When Patricia Myers (â€œBeneficiaryâ€) made a claim for the \r\n  proceeds of the policy, her claim was denied and the premium payments were refunded. \r\n\r\nInsurance Company rescinded the policy based on \r\n  alleged misrepresentations made in the reinstatement application.Â  In her application \r\n  for reinstatement (which references the original application in the policy), \r\n  Decedent indicated that there had been no change in her health from that noted \r\n  on her original policy. In her original application, Decedent did not \r\n  indicate that she had any of the listed problems. The Insurance Company asserted \r\n  that had it known Decedentâ€™s medical condition at the time of her reapplication, \r\n  it would not have approved the application and thus, would not have reinstated \r\n  coverage. Insurance Company based its ability to rescind on the incontestability \r\n  clause in the policy. \r\nIn denying Beneficiaryâ€™s claim, Insurance Company \r\n  mentioned in its letter to Beneficiary that when the policy was reinstated, \r\n  the incontestability clause was reinstated as well. The insurance policy provides \r\n  for a limited period during which Insurance Company can contest the policy.Â  \r\n  The provision states: \r\n\r\nINCONTESTABILITY.Â  We cannot contest this policy, except for \r\n  nonpayment of premium, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the \r\n  insured for a period of two years from the Policy Date. \r\n\r\nBeneficiary brought a breach of contract action \r\n  against Insurance Company. The trial court heard arguments as to Beneficiaryâ€™s \r\n  motion in limine, which sought to keep evidence of Decedentâ€™s medical \r\n  condition from being considered based on the notion that the incontestability \r\n  period had run. Â Insurance Company argued that the incontestability period \r\n  started over upon reinstatement.Â  In its final order, the trial court denied \r\n  the motion and considered evidence of Decedentâ€™s medical condition.Â  Based on \r\n  that medical evidence, the court declared the policy null and void.Â  We affirm.Â &nbsp;  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œGenerally, an action on a life insurance policy \r\n  is a legal action involving a question of contract law.â€Â  Estate of Revis \r\n  by Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 476, 484 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n  â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of \r\n  review extends only to the correction of errors of law.â€ Key Corporate Capital, \r\n  Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 360 S.C. 513, 516, 602 S.E.2d 104, 106 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted).Â  In addition, the trial courtâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact will not be disturbed unless the record contains no supporting evidence.Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBeneficiary argues that the motion in limine \r\n  to exclude evidence of Decedentâ€™s medical condition should have been granted \r\n  based on the running of the incontestability period. We disagree.\r\nInsurance policies are subject to the rules of \r\n  contract construction.Â  B.L.G. Enters., Inc. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., \r\n  334 S.C. 529, 535, 514 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1999).Â  Courts must give policy language \r\n  its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  Id.Â  When the contract is \r\n  unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms \r\n  used by the parties.Â  Id.  \r\nBeneficiary argues the rules of reinstatement do \r\n  not allow revival of the contestability period because reinstating an insurance \r\n  policy does not create a new contract. Beneficiary is correct that the reinstatement \r\n  of an insurance policy does not create a new contract of insurance. However, \r\n  in Murray v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 193 S.C. 368, 373, 8 S.E.2d \r\n  314, 316 (1940), our Supreme Court held that reinstatement is â€œa contract by \r\n  virtue of which the policy already issued, under the conditions prescribed \r\n  therein, is revived or restored after its lapse.â€Â  Id.Â  (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  No new contract is created, rather the conditions of the policy remain \r\n  the terms of the contract.Â  The terms of this contract provide for reinstatement \r\n  subject to evidence of insurability and for a contestability period of two years \r\n  from the policy date. [1] \r\nBeneficiary contends that reviving the period of \r\n  incontestability modifies the terms of and/or adds a new term to the contract. \r\n  This is simply not the case.Â  As stated in Murray, the parties remain \r\n  subject to the same conditions prescribed in the original policy.Â  193 S.C. \r\n  at 373, 8 S.E.2d at 316.\r\nBeneficiary also argues that the policy is ambiguous.Â  \r\n  The terms of the policy are the same as those required by Section 38-63-220 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code.Â  Subsection (d) mandates that life insurance policies \r\n  include:\r\n\r\na provision that the policy and \r\n  any rider or supplemental benefits attached to the policy are incontestable \r\n  as to the truth of the application for insurance and to the representations \r\n  of the insured individual after they have been in force during the lifetime \r\n  of the insured for a period of two years from their date of issue.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-63-220 (d) \r\n  (2002).\r\nFurthermore, subsection (j) states (in pertinent \r\n  part) that individual life insurance policies must include:\r\n\r\na provision that the policy may \r\n  be reinstated at any time within three years after the date of default in the \r\n  payment of the premium . . . upon evidence of insurability satisfactory to the \r\n  insurer and the payment of all overdue premiums and payment . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-63-220 (j) (2002).\r\nWe do not find the language ambiguous. \r\n  It clearly provides for a period of contestability for two years from the date \r\n  of issue and reinstatement subject to evidence of insurability.\r\nNor do we find the terms of the policy, which were \r\n  taken directly from the South Carolina Code, ambiguous.Â  The policy clearly \r\n  provides for reinstatement â€œsubject to evidence of insurability satisfactory \r\n  to [the Insurance Company]â€ and for a period of contestability â€œduring the lifetime \r\n  of the insured for a period of two years from the Policy Date.â€ The original \r\n  application specifically mentions the â€œIncontestability Provision,â€ and the \r\n  reinstatement application references the original application in the policy.Â  \r\n  Based on the terms used by the parties, reinstatement of the policy is subject \r\n  to evidence of insurability satisfactory to Insurance Company and a two year \r\n  period of contestability.\r\nFinally, Beneficiary contends that the period of \r\n  contestability begins on the original policy date, and does not start over upon \r\n  reinstatement.Â  However, a review of South Carolina law reveals that the contestability \r\n  period begins anew on reinstatement.Â  See Murray, 193 S.C. at \r\n  370-71, 378, 8 S.E.2d at 315, 318; Ward v. New York Life Ins. Co., 129 \r\n  S.C. 121, 123 S.E. 820 (1924); P. G. Guthrie, Annotation, Insurance: Incontestable \r\n  Clause As Affected By Reinstatement of Policy, 23 A.L.R.3d 743, 748 (1969). \r\n\r\nAlthough the reinstatement application does not \r\n  in and of itself restart the incontestability period, in this case it references \r\n  the original application, which specifically mentions the â€œIncontestability \r\n  Provision.â€ Thus, by its own terms, the policy provides for a period of contestability \r\n  and requires evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the plain meaning of the policy, Insurance \r\n  Company had two years from the date of reinstatement to contest the policy.Â  \r\n  Because Decedent passed away before the expiration of that period, Insurance \r\n  Company could contest the representations she made in her reinstatement application.Â  \r\n  The trial court could consider medical evidence related to those representations.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the motion in limine was properly denied.Â  Therefore, the \r\n  decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY AND ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Specifically, the policy provides that: â€œReinstatement will be subject \r\n    to: (a) evidence of insurability satisfactory to us; (b) payment of overdue \r\n    premiums with interest at the rate of 6 % per year.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3895","title":"In Re: The Estate of Melvin Hyman","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3895","description":"M.

Richardson Hyman, Jr. appeals \r\n  a circuit court order affirming the special refereeâ€™s decision that a vested \r\n  remainder in certain stocks owned by Hymanâ€™s father passed to his wife through \r\n  the residuary clause of his will and not through a direct devise to his children.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\n FACTS\r\nFollowing a lifetime of distinguished \r\n  service to the people of this state as a highly respected member of the South \r\n  Carolina Bar, Melvin Hyman passed away in 1973.Â  He was survived by his wife, \r\n  Maintzie R. Hyman, and two children, Melvin R. Hyman and Mary C. Hyman.Â  In \r\n  his last will and testament, Melvin Hyman granted a life estate in certain securities \r\n  to his wife, with a remainder interest to his two children.Â  Melvin Hyman expressly \r\n  stated in his will that his childrenâ€™s remainder interest would â€œvest immediately \r\n  upon [his] death, subject only to the life estate devised and bequeathed to \r\n  my said wife.â€Â  \r\nIn 1984, Melvin Hymanâ€™s son, Melvin \r\n  R. Hyman (â€œTestatorâ€), was diagnosed with a life threatening disease.Â  Because \r\n  his condition worsened over the years following this diagnosis, Testator decided \r\n  to undergo an operation in September 1987.Â  In contemplation of serious risks \r\n  inherent in this particular kind of surgery, he executed a will shortly before \r\n  the operation.Â  A few weeks following the surgery, Testator passed away. Testator \r\n  was survived by his mother, Maintzie; his second wife, Sara Hyman; and three \r\n  children from his first marriage, M. Richardson Hyman, Jr. (â€œAppellantâ€), Benjamin \r\n  F. Hyman, and M. Caroline Hyman.Â  \r\nArticle three of Testatorâ€™s will, \r\n  which establishes a trust for the benefit of his children, states the following:\r\n\r\nI will, devise, and bequeath to my three children any and \r\n  all property which I may receive by reason of inheritance from my motherâ€™s [Maintzieâ€™s] \r\n  estate.\r\n\r\nTestator also provided that the residue of his estate \r\n  was to be distributed to his wife, Sara Hyman, outright and free of trust. Â Â \r\nIn January 1999, Maintzie R. Hyman, \r\n  wife of Melvin Hyman and mother of Testator, passed away, terminating her life \r\n  estate in the aforementioned securities at issue in this case.Â  At this time, \r\n  the remainder interests devised to Testator and Mary C. Hyman became possessory.Â  \r\n  Sara Hyman, Testatorâ€™s wife, began receiving distributions and paying taxes \r\n  on Testatorâ€™s portion of the securities pursuant to the residuary clause of \r\n  Testatorâ€™s will.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Appellant filed this action \r\n  seeking to reopen Testatorâ€™s estate and declare Testatorâ€™s three children the \r\n  lawful heirs of the securities pursuant to article three of Testatorâ€™s will.Â  \r\n  The case was referred by consent of the parties to a special referee.Â  At trial, \r\n  Appellant offered testimony, over the respondentsâ€™ objection, from Mary C. Hyman, \r\n  sister of Testator, which evidenced Testatorâ€™s intent that his remainder interest \r\n  in the securities pass through his will to his children, notwithstanding the \r\n  willâ€™s express language. [1] Â Â  \r\n  Although this testimony was allowed at trial, the referee later determined it \r\n  was improperly admitted, as the will contained no ambiguity which would warrant \r\n  the admission of extrinsic evidence.Â  The referee found, by the plain and ordinary \r\n  meaning of the willâ€™s language, that the remainder interest in the securities \r\n  owned by Testator passed to his wife through the residuary clause of his will \r\n  and not to his children by the direct devise of article three.Â  The circuit \r\n  court affirmed the refereeâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review applicable \r\n  to cases originating in the probate court is controlled by whether the underlying \r\n  cause of action is at law or in equity.Â  Howard v. Mutz, 315 S.C. 356, \r\n  361-62, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257-58 (1993). This is an action at law.Â  NationsBank \r\n  of South Carolina v. Greenwood, 321 S.C. 386, 392, 468 S.E.2d 658, 661 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (holding an action to construe a will is an action at law).Â  If a \r\n  proceeding in the probate court is in the nature of an action at law, review \r\n  by this court extends merely to the correction of legal errors.Â Â  Townes \r\n  Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 \r\n  (1976).\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the probate \r\n  court erred in finding no ambiguity in Testatorâ€™s will and refusing to consider \r\n  extrinsic evidence to ascertain Testatorâ€™s true intent.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn construing a will, a court \r\n  should give effect to the expressed intention of the testator.Â  Bagwell v. \r\n  Alexander, 285 S.C. 331, 329 S.E.2d 771 (Ct. App. 1985).Â Â  In ascertaining \r\n  this intent, a courtâ€™s first reference is always to the will's language itself.Â  \r\n  Fenzel v. Floyd, 289 S.C. 495, 498, 347 S.E.2d 105, 107 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986).Â  When construing this language, the reviewing tribunal must give \r\n  the words contained in the document their ordinary and plain meaning.Â  In \r\n  re Estate of Fabian, 326 S.C. 349, 353, 483 S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n  Where the testatorâ€™s intent is ascertainable from the will and not counter to \r\n  law, we will give it effect.Â  Id.Â  Only when the willâ€™s terms or provisions \r\n  are ambiguous may the court resort to extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity.Â  \r\n  See Fenzel, 289 S.C. at 498, 347 S.E.2d at 107.\r\nIn the case at bar, the Testatorâ€™s remainder \r\n  interest in the securities clearly does not pass through article three of the \r\n  will to his children when the language of article three is given its plain and \r\n  ordinary meaning.Â  The provision states, â€œI will, devise, and bequeath to my \r\n  three children any and all property which I may receive by reason of inheritance \r\n  from my motherâ€™s estate.â€Â  Testator owned his remainder interest in the securities \r\n  at the time he executed his will.Â  The remainder interest, though subject to \r\n  his motherâ€™s life estate, was at no time part of his motherâ€™s actual estate \r\n  and, thus, never passed to him through inheritance from his mother.Â  Appellant \r\n  contends, however, that the provision is ambiguous; therefore, the court should \r\n  consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain Testatorâ€™s true intent.Â  We do not \r\n  agree with this position.Â Â  \r\nThere are two types \r\n  of ambiguities found in the construction of wills: \r\n\r\nAmbiguities . . . are patent \r\n  and latent; the distinction being that in the former case the uncertainty is \r\n  one which arises upon the words of the . . . instrument as looked at in themselves, \r\n  and before any attempt is made to apply them to the object which they describe, \r\n  while in the latter case the uncertainty arises, not upon the words of the . \r\n  . . instrument as looked at in themselves, but upon those words when applied \r\n  to the object or subject which they describe. \r\n\r\nFabian, 326 S.C. at 353, \r\n  483 S.E.2d at 476 (quoting Jennings v. Talbert, 77 S.C. 454, 456, 58 \r\n  S.E. 420, 421 (1907)).Â  It is undisputed that the will in the case before us \r\n  contains no patent ambiguity arising from the willâ€™s own language.Â  It is, however, \r\n  argued that, when one considers Testatorâ€™s property and the circumstances known \r\n  to him at the execution of his will, a latent ambiguity arises and extrinsic \r\n  evidence may be admitted to resolve it.Â  \r\nAppellant first contends \r\n  the will is inconsistent when applied to Testatorâ€™s property because, without \r\n  the remainder interest, the childrenâ€™s trust is left unfunded.Â  According to \r\n  Appellant, Testator must have been aware of his motherâ€™s relative good health \r\n  at the time of the willâ€™s execution and, thus, could not have intended to leave \r\n  the trust barren in the probable circumstance that he predeceased his mother.Â Â  \r\n  Because a testator is presumed to have disposed of all property that he owned \r\n  and the remainder interest was not specifically disposed, Appellant argues the \r\n  will is ambiguous.Â  See Gano v. Gano, 88 N.E. 146, 147 (Ill. 1909).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe presumption, arising \r\n  from the lawâ€™s disfavoring of partial intestacy, that a testator intends to \r\n  dispose of his entire estate is, in fact, a longstanding rule in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  See Dobson v. Smith, 213 S.C. 15, 48 S.E.2d 607 (1948).Â  However, \r\n  intestacy is not an issue in this matter.Â  Testator disposed of his entire estate \r\n  under the willâ€™s residuary clause.Â  Furthermore, by Testatorâ€™s language in article \r\n  three, he acknowledges he does not own the property, which he â€œmay receive \r\n  by reason of inheritanceâ€ from his mother.Â  These words clearly establish a \r\n  contingency providing for Testatorâ€™s children in the event their grandmother \r\n  died before their father, no matter how unlikely.Â  Where a testator employs \r\n  language that is clear and definite, the function of the court is consigned \r\n  to the interpretation of the will and the enforcement of its provisions without \r\n  resorting to rules of construction.Â  80 Am. Jur. 2d Wills Â§1132 (2004).Â  \r\n  â€œCircumstances known to Testator at the time of execution are an admissible \r\n  aid in construing doubtful provisions, but the main recourse must be \r\n  to the language used in the will.â€Â  Limehouse v. Limehouse, 256 S.C. \r\n  255, 257, 182 S.E.2d 58, 59 (1971) (emphasis added).Â  Because the language of \r\n  Article three is clear and definite, not doubtful, the referee was proper in \r\n  upholding the provisionâ€™s plain meaning.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant also contends \r\n  the will is ambiguous because extrinsic evidence in the form of Testatorâ€™s sisterâ€™s \r\n  testimony shows Testatorâ€™s intent to be different from the plain language of \r\n  the will and the findings of the special referee.Â Â Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nA court may admit extrinsic \r\n  evidence to determine whether a latent ambiguity exists. \r\n  [2] Â  Fabian, 326 S.C. at 353, 483 S.E.2d at 476.Â  In order to find \r\n  an ambiguity, however, the extrinsic evidence must reflect that the words of \r\n  the will, when applied to the object or subject which they describe, are â€œincapable \r\n  of application as they stand.â€Â  Boykin v. Capehart, 205 S.C. 276, 31 \r\n  S.E.2d 506 (1994).Â  The mere showing that a testator may have intended a testamentary \r\n  construction in direct contradiction to the plain meaning of the willâ€™s language \r\n  is not enough.Â  As the supreme court has stated, â€œ[a] will must be read in the \r\n  ordinary and grammatical sense of the words employed, unless some obvious absurdity, \r\n  repugnancy or inconsistency with the declared intention of the testatorâ€ should \r\n  follow.Â  In the Matter of Ezra Clark, 308 S.C. 328, 330, 417 S.E.2d 856, \r\n  857 (1992).\r\n The special referee correctly found \r\n  that giving the language of this will its plain and ordinary meaning did not \r\n  render it â€œincapable of applicationâ€ or result in â€œan obvious absurdity, repugnancy, \r\n  or inconsistency with Testatorâ€™s declared intent.â€Â  Boykin, 205 S.C. \r\n  at 279, 31 S.E.2d at 508; Id.Â  At the time Testator created his will, \r\n  Maintzie Hyman had a considerable estate she conceivably could have left to \r\n  Testator if the contingency of her death before his had been met, thereby fulfilling \r\n  his primary goal of providing for the â€œreasonable comfortâ€ and proper education \r\n  of his three children.Â  Accordingly, the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  findings that no latent ambiguity exists; therefore, the use of extrinsic evidence \r\n  to determine Testatorâ€™s intent is not appropriate.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the circuit court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Specifically, Testatorâ€™s sister testified she and her brother both \r\n    frequently referred to their vested remainder interests in their motherâ€™s \r\n    life estate as property that would come to them from their mother, their â€œmotherâ€™s \r\n    estate,â€ or â€œthe Hyman estate.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Once the court finds a latent ambiguity, extrinsic evidence is also \r\n    permitted to help the court determine the testatorâ€™s true intent and resolve \r\n    the ambiguity.Â  Fabian, 326 S.C. at 353, 483 S.E.2d at 476.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3896","title":"Doe v.

Dawes Cooke, Jr., \r\n  of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  John Doe filed an action for breach of fiduciary duty \r\n  and professional negligence against Gedney M. Howe, III and Gedney M. Howe, \r\n  III, P.A. (collectively, â€œHoweâ€). Doe filed a motion for confidentiality seeking \r\n  permission from the circuit court to proceed anonymously, which was denied.Â  \r\n  Doe appeals, and we reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nDoe was previously represented by Howe \r\n  and his brother Donald H. Howe in connection with a civil claim against Porter \r\n  Gaud School and others relating to allegations of sexual abuse by an employee \r\n  of the school, Eddie Fischer. [1] Â  Doe attended Porter Gaud from 1968 through \r\n  1980.Â  The alleged abuse occurred from 1977 until 1982, two years after his \r\n  graduation from Porter Gaud.Â  In 1999, Howe agreed to represent Doe in the civil \r\n  action against the Porter Gaud defendants.Â  When the action was filed Doe was \r\n  36 years old. Doeâ€™s legal counsel recognized two potential impediments to a \r\n  favorable judgment.Â  The first and primary concern dealt with the statute of \r\n  limitations, and the second hurdle dealt with a potential immunity defense.Â  \r\n  Because of these problems, counsel pursued, with Doeâ€™s consent, settlement negotiations.Â  \r\n  These negotiations resulted in a settlement agreement.Â  On May 24, 2000, Doe \r\n  signed a â€œConfidential Settlement Agreement and Releaseâ€ settling all past, \r\n  current, and future claims against Porter Gaud, in exchange for what Doe characterizes \r\n  as â€œa modest payment of money ....â€Â  \r\nIn November 2000, another former student who claimed to have been sexually \r\n  abused by Fischer, brought an action against Porter Gaud.Â  That case proceeded \r\n  to a jury trial, resulting in a verdict for over one hundred million dollars.Â  \r\n  Doe responded to news of the jury verdict by contacting Donald Howe to discuss \r\n  the possibility of setting aside his settlement.Â  Donald Howe ultimately informed \r\n  Doe that the settlement was final, and there was no basis to set aside the settlement \r\n  agreement.\r\nDoe filed a complaint asserting causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty \r\n  and professional negligence against Howe.Â  Doe subsequently filed a motion of \r\n  confidentiality asking the circuit court to issue an order â€œrequiring the parties \r\n  and their counsel, and any expert witnesses who may be consulted or designated \r\n  by the parties, from directly or indirectly divulging the true identity of the \r\n  plaintiff in this matter, until further order of the Court.â€Â  The motion states, \r\n  â€œit is the interests of justice that he be permitted to proceed in this matter \r\n  confidentially, at least in the pretrial phases, in order to protect \r\n  him from embarrassment, harassment, or divulging of personal information.â€Â  \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Doeâ€™s counsel confirmed at the motion hearing that Doeâ€™s \r\n  request for anonymity was limited to the pretrial proceedings.\r\nFollowing a hearing, \r\n  the circuit court issued an order denying the motion.Â  The circuit court order \r\n  acknowledged that in the course of the Porter Gaud litigation, victims and witnesses \r\n  were permitted to use pseudonyms but found the issues in this case â€œentirely \r\n  different from the Porter Gaud litigation.â€Â  On a motion for reconsideration, \r\n  the circuit court affirmed its previous order denying the motion to proceed \r\n  anonymously.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis court will be bound by the factual findings of the trial court made in \r\n  response to motions preliminary to trial where the findings are supported by \r\n  evidence and not clearly wrong or controlled by error of law.Â  City of Chester \r\n  v. Addison, 277 S.C. 179, 182, 284 S.E.2d 579, 580 (1981); Askins v. \r\n  Firedoor Corp. of Florida, 281 S.C. 611, 615, 316 S.E.2d 713, 715 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe single issue \r\n  raised on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in denying Doeâ€™s motion \r\n  to proceed anonymously.Â  However, we are first confronted with whether this \r\n  interlocutory order is immediately appealable.Â  A fundamental rule of appellate \r\n  procedure is that a judgment or order must usually be final before it can be \r\n  appealed.Â  See Culbertson v. Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 23, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  163, 164 (1996) (â€œAs a general rule, only final judgments are appealable.â€).Â  \r\n  Rule 201(a) SCACR, provides that an: â€œ[a]ppeal may be taken, as provided by \r\n  law, from any final judgment or appealable order.â€Â  Section 14-3-330 of the \r\n  South Carolina Code (1991) defines categories of appealable judgments and codifies \r\n  the final judgment rule.Â  â€œFinal judgmentâ€ is a term of art referring to the \r\n  disposition of all the issues in the case.Â  Link v. Sch. Dist. of Pickens \r\n  County, 302 S.C. 1, n.3, 393 S.E.2d 176, n.3 (1990).\r\nCertain interlocutory \r\n  orders are, however, immediately appealable.Â  An interlocutory order is appealable \r\n  if it falls into one of a few, limited categories of appealable judgments or \r\n  orders.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (Supp. 2003);Â  Woodward v. Westvaco Corp., \r\n  319 S.C. 240, 242, 460 S.E.2d 392, 393 (1995) (overruled on other grounds by \r\n  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002)).Â  \r\n  Whether the denial of a request to proceed anonymously is immediately appealable \r\n  is an issue of first impression in South Carolina.\r\nThe final judgment \r\n  rule serves the laudatory goal of preventing piecemeal review of matters that \r\n  are merely steps toward a final judgment.Â  In light of the policy underpinnings \r\n  of the final judgment rule, exceptions should be recognized cautiously.\r\nFederal courts have \r\n  addressed the issue of the appealability of such orders, holding that the refusal \r\n  â€œto allow parties to proceed anonymously at trial is â€˜separate from and collateral \r\n  toâ€™ the merits of the action.â€™â€Â  James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 237 (4th \r\n  Cir.1993) (citing Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180 (5th Cir.1981) and \r\n  S. Methodist Univ. Assâ€™n v. Wynne &amp; Jaffee, 599 F.2d 707 (5th Cir.1979)).Â  \r\n  Under the collateral order analysis employed by the federal courts, the order \r\n  is appealable if it (1) conclusively determines the question, (2) resolves an \r\n  important question independent of the merits, and (3) is effectively unreviewable \r\n  on appeal from a final judgment.Â  Id., 653 F.2d at 236.Â  \r\nWe are persuaded \r\n  that the denial of Doeâ€™s motion to proceed anonymously meets the criteria for \r\n  appellate review.Â  The decision conclusively determines the question, is a question \r\n  independent of the merits of the litigation and would be effectively unreviewable \r\n  on final appeal once Doeâ€™s true identity was revealed.Â  The order denying Doeâ€™s \r\n  motion to proceed anonymously prior to trial has the effect of revealing his \r\n  identity, the very thing he was seeking to keep confidential.Â  Therefore, we \r\n  find that the order is immediately appealable and address whether the circuit \r\n  court erred in denying Doeâ€™s motion to proceed anonymously. \r\nOur courts have long recognized the need for confidentiality \r\n  in cases dealing with sensitive and personal subject matter.Â  In cases involving \r\n  the sexual abuse of children, the courts have judicially protected the names \r\n  of the victims.Â  See Doe by Roe v. Orangeburg County Sch. Dist., \r\n  335 S.C. 556, 518 S.E.2d 259 (1999); Doe by Doe v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., \r\n  323 S.C. 33, 448 S.E.2d 564 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Additionally, the names of victims \r\n  of criminal sexual conduct are prohibited by law from being publicly disclosed \r\n  in news media.Â Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-730 (2003) (â€œWhoever publishes \r\n  or causes to be published the name of any person upon whom the crime of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct has been committed or alleged to have been committed in this \r\n  State in any newspaper, magazine or other publication shall be deemed guilty \r\n  of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of \r\n  not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment of not more than three years.â€).\r\nThere is no litmus test in South Carolina to determine \r\n  whether a litigant in a civil proceeding should be allowed to proceed anonymously.Â  \r\n  We believe that the better practice is one which avoids a rigid, formulaic approach, \r\n  thereby allowing the trial courts a degree of flexibility in this fact-sensitive \r\n  area.Â  In the present case, we find the factors utilized in the Fourth Circuit \r\n  provide appropriate guidance:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         whether the justification asserted \r\n  by the requesting party is merely to avoid the annoyance and criticism that \r\n  may attend any litigation or is to preserve privacy in a matter of sensitive \r\n  and highly personal nature;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (2)\r\n         whether identification poses \r\n  a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the requesting party or even \r\n  more critically, to innocent non-parties;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (3)&nbsp;\r\n         the ages of the persons whose \r\n  privacy interests are sought to be protected;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (4)&nbsp;\r\n         whether the action is against \r\n  a governmental or private party; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (5)&nbsp;\r\n         the risk of unfairness to the \r\n  opposing party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously. [2] \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJames v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d at 238 (emphasis added);Â  \r\n  America On Line, Inc. v. Anonymous Publicly Traded Company, 261 Va. 350, \r\n  363, 542 S.E.2d 377, 384 (2001) (citing James v. Jacobson) (trial court \r\n  considered enumerated factors and permitted the plaintiff to proceed anonymously \r\n  â€œto avoid annoyance and criticism that may attend any type of litigationâ€ and \r\n  â€œto preserve privacy in a matter or sensitive and highly personal natureâ€). \r\n\r\nThe decision to proceed anonymously is committed to \r\n  the discretion of the trial court.Â  Though there is a presumption of openness \r\n  of judicial proceedings, it operates â€œonly as a presumption and not as an absolute, \r\n  unreviewable license to deny.â€Â  James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d at 238.\r\nWe agree with Doe that the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  that the underlying facts of the sexual abuse claims â€œare not the focus of this \r\n  particular litigation.â€Â  The court found that â€œ[p]ursuing the malpractice cause \r\n  of action does not require [Doe] to publish his personal life and sexual history \r\n  indiscriminately.Â Â  The allegations of sexual abuse are peripheral to the malpractice \r\n  allegations.â€Â  The record does not support this finding.\r\nHere, Howeâ€™s defense to the claims of professional \r\n  negligence and breach of fiduciary duty requires an examination of the merits \r\n  of the original sexual abuse claims against Porter Gaud.Â  In effect, it requires \r\n  a â€œtrial within a trial.â€Â  The record includes Doeâ€™s deposition in which appear \r\n  the times, places, and sexual acts that were the basis of the claim against \r\n  Porter Gaud.Â  Clearly, the malpractice case cannot be litigated in a vacuum.Â  \r\n  It is readily apparent that revealing Doeâ€™s identity would likely cause the \r\n  harm and social stigmatization he understandably seeks to avoid.Â  Doe has established \r\n  the need to â€œpreserve privacy in a matter of [a] sensitive and highly personal \r\n  nature.â€Â  Id.\r\nFurthermore, the order of the circuit court found that \r\n  â€œ[t]he sexual assaults in the underlying claim for which Defendants represented \r\n  him occurred many years ago.â€Â  Answers in the deposition belie the suggestion \r\n  that the mere passage of time removes the claimed embarrassment and humiliation \r\n  purportedly suffered by Doe.Â  While the passage of time may be an appropriate \r\n  factor in the judgeâ€™s analysis, it is not dispositive and in this case, it carries \r\n  little weight in advancing Howeâ€™s efforts to compel Doe to disclose his identity.\r\nWe conversely discern no prejudice or â€œrisk of unfairnessâ€ \r\n  to Howe in allowing Doe to proceed anonymously in the â€œpretrial phases.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  Howe has failed to demonstrate that his ability to conduct further \r\n  discovery or otherwise prepare for trial will be hindered by allowing Doe to \r\n  proceed anonymously prior to trial. \r\n  [4]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe are firmly persuaded that the general presumption \r\n  of public identification of parties should yield under the record before us \r\n  to Doeâ€™s request that he be permitted to proceed anonymously prior to trial.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] It appears that Donald Howe was Doeâ€™s primary counsel, although \r\n    the allegations in connection with the malpractice claim are primarily directed \r\n    against Gedney Howe.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] We cite these factors as a nonexclusive list, and recognize \r\n    that on a case-by-case basis other factors may require consideration. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] This is the relief sought by Doe in his motion in the circuit \r\n    court, and this is the relief he will receive as a result of our reversal \r\n    of the circuit court.Â  The matter of additional relief is not before us.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] It was disclosed at oral argument that Howe has been granted \r\n    summary judgment on Doeâ€™s malpractice complaint.Â  We are further informed \r\n    that Doe has appealed the grant of summary judgment.Â  Doeâ€™s appeal from the \r\n    denial of his motion to proceed anonymously remains a justiciable controversy, \r\n    and the present appeal is not rendered moot by the grant of summary judgment \r\n    to Howe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3897","title":"State v.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â Â  Â  This case arises from a convenience store robbery, which resulted in the death of one of the storeâ€™s owners and injury to the other owner.Â  Paris McLeod appeals from his conviction for murder and sentence of thirty years imprisonment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPerry Lloyd and his wife owned and operated the B &amp; D convenience store in Rembert, South Carolina. Â On December 21, 1999, Lloyd was locking up the store for the evening after removing the dayâ€™s proceeds.Â  His wife was seated in the passenger seat of his truck parked in front of the store.Â  When Lloyd turned from locking the front door, Rashaun Brooks, one of McLeodâ€™s codefendants, jumped around the corner of the store holding a gun and demanded that Lloyd â€œgive it up.â€Â  Lloyd initially thought it was a joke.Â  However, Brooks fired his gun twice.Â  Dropping the bag of money, Lloyd backed toward his truck.\r\nBrooks retrieved the bag of money from the ground and said to Lloyd,Â Â  â€œDidnâ€™t I say give it up?â€Â  Brooks shot again, this time in the direction of the truck.Â  Lloyd observed McLeod emerge from the dark holding a shotgun.Â  As Lloyd reached for his pistol, McLeod stumbled and the shotgun fired.Â  The shot struck Lloyd in the leg.Â  At the same time Lloyd was pulling his pistol, Jermaine Harris, McLeodâ€™s second codefendant, began shooting at Lloyd.Â  Lloyd fired two bullets from his pistol and, after Brooks fired two more shots, the three assailants ran.\r\nLloyd stood after the robbers fled, though he had multiple wounds to the legs.Â  Lloyd testified he heard a bullet strike the truck during the shooting.Â  When he checked on his wife in the truck, he discovered she had been wounded from a gunshot to the head.Â  He stated he saw â€œthe last breath and the blood running from her head.â€Â  Lloyd went inside the store, called 911, and frantically sought help for his wife.Â  Yet his wifeâ€™s gunshot wound was fatal.\r\nIn his telephone call to 911, Lloyd explained he and his wife had both been shot.Â  He advised the dispatcher that the suspects included McLeod.Â  Lloyd referred to McLeod as P.J. on the 911 call and when he made his identification to Lieutenant Wesley Gardner.Â  Additionally, he stated all of the suspects had weapons.Â  When describing the individuals to the dispatcher, he stated: â€œAlright, I canâ€™t tell you exactly what the other ones had on, but I know P.J.Â  All of â€˜em the same ones I have trouble with right here all the time.â€\r\nOne of the initial responding officers was Lieutenant Wesley Gardner, an investigator with the Sumter County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  Lt. Gardner questioned Lloyd regarding the events.Â  Lloyd declared he knew three of the attackers.Â  He identified his attackers as McLeod, Brooks, and Harris.Â  The identification of these three men was certain.Â  However, Lloyd told Lt. Gardner that he saw shadows, so there may have been more individuals involved.\r\nShortly after the shooting, McLeod, Brooks, and Harris were arrested at a nearby residence.Â  The police arrested Leroy Porter at the same time, but on an unrelated charge.Â  Following his arrest, Porter offered to assist in retrieving the weapons used in the convenience store robbery and murder.Â  The police were unable to find the guns in their first search attempt using Porterâ€™s information.Â  Thereafter, Porter was asked to wear a wire to record a conversation between himself and Brooks in Brooksâ€™ jail cell.Â  After reviewing the recorded conversation, the police located a rifle that was connected to the shells used during the convenience store robbery.\r\nAs corroborating evidence, the State presented the testimony of Lakeysha Nelson.Â  Nelson informed the police she was at a gathering with McLeod and Brooks shortly prior to the attack.Â  Nelson stated Brooks had a gun and McLeod told Brooks â€œthat he needed money,â€ and â€œthat they needed to rob somebody.â€\r\nMcLeod was thirteen at the time of the robbery and shootings.Â  He was indicted for murder, armed robbery, assault and battery with intent to kill, possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, first degree lynching, and second degree lynching.Â  After hearings before the family court, jurisdiction was transferred to General Sessions court.Â  All charges except the murder charge were remanded to the family court for consideration.\r\nMcLeod was tried with his codefendants.Â  He was convicted of murder.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003). This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Mattison, 352 S.C. at 6, 583 S.E.2d at 855.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 353, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377-78, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793-94 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  See State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); see also State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995) (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Rule 613(b), SCRE\r\nDuring the trial, Lt. Gardner was questioned about whether he had entered into a prior agreement with Porter.Â  Lt. Gardner denied making a statement that he made an agreement with Porter.Â  Brooks sought to impeach Lt. Gardner by introducing evidence of a purported prior statement Lt. Gardner had made admitting he had entered into an agreement with Porter. Â \r\nAfter removing the jury, the trial judge heard testimony regarding the circumstances of the prior statement.Â  Brooksâ€™ trial counsel alleged the conversation between Lt. Gardner and Porter occurred at the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  Brooks called Officer John Davis[1] who recalled a conversation occurring on the second floor of the law enforcement center.Â  Davis said the term â€œagreementâ€ was not specifically used but that Lt. Gardner agreed to take his cooperation into consideration.Â  Davis alleged that the conversation took place in either December or January.Â  After hearing the testimony, the trial judge sustained the Stateâ€™s objection and refused to allow Brooks to impeach Lt. Gardner.Â  McLeodâ€™s counsel joined in the objection to the refusal to allow the impeachment evidence and the proffer of the evidence.\r\nMcLeod argues the circuit court erred when it did not allow him to impeach Lt. Gardner with his prior statement.Â  We disagree.\r\n Rule 613(b), SCRE, provides:\r\n\r\n  Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.Â  If a witness does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina rule differs from the federal rule in that a proper foundation must be laid before admitting a prior inconsistent statement.Â  It is mandatory that a witness be permitted to admit, deny, or explain a prior inconsistent statement.Â  Under Rule 613(b), extrinsic evidence of the statement is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made.Â  Rule 613(b) explicates the procedure for impeachment by a prior inconsistent statement and requires laying the foundation.Â  See State v. Sierra, 337 S.C. 368, 523 S.E.2d 187 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nDuring questioning of Lt. Gardner about the alleged conversation, counsel asked whether he recalled a conversation that took place in the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  Davis testified to a conversation which occurred in the second floor classroom of the law enforcement center.Â  Finally, Davis could not testify to the statement or its meaning.Â  Davis gave his own interpretation.Â  He admitted the conversation could have been about a prior instance and may have involved other charges.Â  Consequently, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the testimony due to the failure to provide a sufficient foundation under Rule 613(b).\r\nII.Â  Relevance\r\nâ€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE; see also State v. Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 69, 536 S.E.2d 666, 669 (2000) (although evidence is relevant, it should be excluded where danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We review a trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nThe trial judge determined the evidence would be more prejudicial than probative.Â  The judge found the only way the State could contradict the evidence would be to call the solicitor as a witness.Â  The individual who allegedly received a deal, Leroy Porter, did not testify at trial.Â  He wore a wire to record a conversation with Brooks, which was played at trial.Â  Brooksâ€™ words spoke for themselves.Â  It is hard to discern what benefit there would have been for the jury to know the solicitor and Lt. Gardner agreed â€œto help him on some charges.â€\r\nAdditionally, any attempt to introduce the impeaching evidence to raise the issue of Porterâ€™s possible guilt in the crime is not a proper reason for its admittance.Â  â€œOur Supreme Court has imposed strict limitations on the admissibility of third-party guilt.â€Â  State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 81, 538 S.E.2d 257, 265 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œEvidence offered by a defendant as to the commission of the crime by another person is limited to facts which are inconsistent with the defendantâ€™s guilt.â€Â  Id.\r\nGiven the minimal probative effect of the evidence, and its clear prejudicial effect, the trial court properly excluded the testimony under Rule 403, SCRE.\r\nIII.Â  Harmless Error\r\nAny error arising from the exclusion of the evidence in the present case would be harmless.\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795.Â  The admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.Â  State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003); Pagan, 357 S.C. at 146, 591 S.E.2d at 653.\r\nIn State v. Fossick, 333 S.C. 66, 70, 508 S.E.2d 32, 33-34 (1998), and State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999), the supreme court applied a harmless error analysis to the failure to allow impeaching testimony.Â  In both cases, the court ruled that although the judge erred in not admitting the impeachment evidence, the error was harmless.Â  The Fossick court concluded:\r\n\r\n  In determining harmless error regarding any issue of witness credibility, we will consider the importance of the witnessâ€™s testimony to the prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the witnessâ€™s testimony was cumulative, whether other evidence corroborates or contradicts the witnessâ€™s testimony, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and the overall strength of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  State v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 464 S.E.2d 334 (1995) (citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)).\r\n  Here, the main thrust of Shaneâ€™s testimony was that he left appellant and Marilee about 1:30 p.m. on the day Marilee disappeared.Â  This same information was admitted into evidence as part of a statement appellant made to police months before his confession that he was with Marilee at 1:30 p.m. that day when Shane saw them on the side of the road.Â  Appellantâ€™s father also testified to this statement which appellant made to police in his fatherâ€™s presence.Â  Accordingly, Shaneâ€™s testimony was cumulative.\r\n  Further, Shaneâ€™s testimony was relatively unimportant to the Stateâ€™s case which rested on appellantâ€™s confession and the fact he led police to the murder weapon.Â  In addition, appellant was permitted extensive cross-examination of Shane and impeached him with extrinsic evidence of conduct Shane denied. In light of all these factors, exclusion of Shaneâ€™s prior inconsistent statement as impeaching evidence was harmless.\r\n\r\nId. at 70, 508 S.E.2d at 34.Â  Citing State v. Fossick, the Beckham court held:\r\n\r\n  [H]ere, the trial judge erred in not admitting the impeachment evidence but we find the error was harmless.Â  McCrawâ€™s testimony was not that important to the Stateâ€™s case.Â  Much of McCrawâ€™s testimony was merely cumulative to Andersonâ€™s testimony and corroborated by other evidence.Â  The majority of McCrawâ€™s testimony was about the phone records of appellant, appellantâ€™s father, Vickieâ€™s father, Anderson, Andersonâ€™s employer (Smugglerâ€™s), and several pay phones, and appellantâ€™s bank records.Â  McCraw also testified as to Andersonâ€™s statement and how he had investigated the information contained in the statement.Â  Appellant was permitted to extensively cross-examine McCraw.Â  Lastly, the Stateâ€™s case was fairly strong. Andersonâ€™s testimony and the evidence of flight were very damning.Â  After considering the Van Arsdall factors in light of the evidence against appellant, we hold the exclusion of this impeachment evidence was harmless.\r\n\r\nId. at 319, 513 S.E.2d at 614-15Â  (footnote omitted).In the instant case, there was overwhelming evidence of McLeodâ€™s guilt.Â  Lloyd identified McLeod as one of the assailants when he called 911.Â  Specifically, he enounced: â€œAlright, I canâ€™t tell you exactly what the other ones had on, but I know P.J.Â  All of â€˜em the same ones I have trouble with right here all the time.â€Â  Additionally, Lloyd was certain of McLeodâ€™s involvement when he provided Lt. Gardner with a list of the individuals involved in the shooting.Â  Finally, during his testimony, Lloyd stated unequivocally: â€œP.J. comes over from out of the dark.Â  When I looked up, I look right straight and I seen him.Â  I look straight down a gun barrel.â€Â  Lloyd then explained how he was shot by McLeod.\r\nAdditionally, the testimony of Nelson provided support for McLeodâ€™s guilt.Â  Nelson stated it was McLeodâ€™s idea to rob someone, because he â€œneeded money.â€Â  She testified that when most of the group left, McLeod, Brooks and Harris stayed behind.Â  These are the same three individuals later identified by Lloyd as his assailants and his wifeâ€™s murderers.\r\n Finally, Lt. Gardnerâ€™s main testimony was in regard to Lloydâ€™s identification of McLeod.Â  Because this testimony was cumulative to Lloydâ€™s identification of McLeod without any qualification, as well as the 911 tape, the error would be harmless.Â  See Fossick, 333 S.C. at 70, 508 S.E.2d at 33-34.Â  Accordingly, even if there were an error in admitting the evidence, which we do not find, the error would be harmless given the overwhelming evidence against McLeod.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe impeachment testimony sought to be introduced by McLeod was properly excluded because a foundation had not been laid pursuant to Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  Additionally, the testimonyâ€™s prejudicial effect greatly outweighed its probative value.Â  Finally, any possible error in its admittance was harmless given the strength of the Stateâ€™s case against McLeod and the cumulative nature of Lt. Gardnerâ€™s testimony.Â  Accordingly, McLeodâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Officer Davis is no longer employed with the Sheriffâ€™s Department, but worked as an investigator with the Department in December of 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
