Jackson appeals his conviction and thirty-year sentence for voluntary\r\n  manslaughter and possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime,\r\n  arguing the trial court erred in excluding evidence of his knowledge of the\r\n  decedent's violent history and in refusing to charge the jury on self-defense.Â \r\n  We affirm the trial court's exclusion of evidence but reverse its refusal to\r\n  charge the jury on self-defense.\r\nFACTS\r\nJackson\r\n  lived in a mobile home with his girlfriend and two children.Â  Jackson's home\r\n  was located adjacent to the mobile home of his sister, Vicki (Sister); her\r\n  boyfriend, Andrew Felder; and Sister's three young children.Â  Jackson's mother,\r\n  Dorothy (Mother), lived with Sister and Felder but sometimes stayed the night\r\n  at Jackson's home.Â  When Mother drank alcohol to the point of intoxication, she\r\n  became boisterous and unpleasant and, when her children were young, whipped\r\n  them and beat Jackson with a broom.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 27, 2003, Mother drank heavily and began arguing with Felder.Â  After\r\n  unsuccessfully asking Mother to leave, Sister went to her brother's home and\r\n  asked him to come and remove Mother from Felder's home.Â  Jackson encountered\r\n  Mother and Felder in the yard between the homes and invited Mother to his home,\r\n  where he was cooking dinner for his family.Â  When she refused, Jackson told her\r\n  his door would be open to her.Â  As Jackson turned back toward his home, Mother\r\n  began to cry and told him Felder disliked Sister's son and beat Sister.Â \r\n  Jackson returned and asked Felder what was going on.Â  Both Felder and Sister\r\n  denied Mother's statements.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  attempted unsuccessfully to re-enter Felder's home.Â  Testimony differed as to\r\n  what happened next.Â  According to Sister, Mother stumbled as she tried to go up\r\n  the steps, Felder caught her as she fell, and Mother told him not to touch\r\n  her.Â  According to Jackson, Felder blocked the door with his body, argued with\r\n  Mother, and the two returned to the yard when Jackson intervened on Mother's\r\n  behalf.Â  Once back in the yard, Mother positioned herself between Jackson and\r\n  Felder and, still arguing with Felder, shoved him.Â  Felder warned Mother not to\r\n  touch him again, and Jackson warned Felder not to touch Mother.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, Felder either shoved or punched Mother, knocking her to the\r\n  ground.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record does not indicate which man delivered the first blow, but when Mother\r\n  fell to the ground, Jackson and Felder began fighting. Â Felder soon pinned\r\n  Jackson against Felder's mobile home, pummeling him.Â  According to his testimony,\r\n  Jackson feared for his life and therefore pulled out his pocketknife and\r\n  stabbed or cut Felder a total of seventeen times.[1]Â \r\n  As Jackson looked on in shock, Felder fell to the ground, bleeding profusely,\r\n  and died.Â  Jackson ran away and hid, discarding his shirt and the knife, but\r\n  turned himself in to police two days later.[2]Â  \r\nJackson\r\n  was charged with murder and possession of a weapon during a crime.Â  The trial\r\n  court sustained the State's objections to testimony concerning Felder's boasts\r\n  about his past crimes and violence.Â  Over Jackson's objections, the trial court\r\n  refused to charge the jury concerning self-defense.Â  Jackson was convicted of\r\n  voluntary manslaughter, for which he was sentenced to thirty years'\r\n  imprisonment, and the weapons charge, for which he was sentenced to a\r\n  concurrent term of five years' imprisonment.Â  Jackson appealed to this court.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Exclusion\r\n  of Evidence\r\nJackson\r\n  argues the trial court erred in excluding his testimony about his personal\r\n  knowledge of Felder's violent history.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the trial\r\n  court's sound discretion, and an appellate court may only disturb a ruling admitting\r\n  or excluding evidence upon a showing of a manifest abuse of discretion\r\n  accompanied by probable prejudice.Â  State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424, 429,\r\n  632 S.E.2d 845, 847-48 (2006).Â  \r\nGenerally, the failure to make a proffer of excluded evidence will\r\n  preclude review on appeal.Â  State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, 163, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 23, 29 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding a proffer of testimony is required to\r\n  preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial\r\n  judge, and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion\r\n  of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded\r\n  testimony would have been).Â  Where no proffer of excluded testimony is made,\r\n  the court is unable to determine whether the appellant was prejudiced by the\r\n  trial court's refusal to admit the testimony into evidence.Â  TNS Mills, Inc.\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't. of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 628, 503 S.E.2d 471, 480 (1998).\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the trial court's decision to exclude evidence of Jackson's knowledge of\r\n  Felder's violent history because Jackson failed to preserve this issue by\r\n  proffering the excluded testimony.Â  Excluded testimony must be proffered to the\r\n  trial court to preserve the issue of its exclusion for appellate review.Â  See Santiago, 370 S.C. at\r\n  163, 634 S.E.2d at 29.Â  Because Jackson made no attempt to proffer this\r\n  testimony, the issue of its exclusion is not preserved for our review.[3]Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Instruction\r\nJackson\r\n  next argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on\r\n  self-defense.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current\r\n  and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646,\r\n  665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472&nbsp;(2004).Â  The evidence presented at trial\r\n  determines the law to be charged to the\r\n  jury.Â  State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 261-62, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  &quot;If there is any evidence of record from which it can be\r\n  reasonably inferred that an accused justifiably inflicted a wound in\r\n  self-defense, then the accused is entitled to a charge on the law of\r\n  self-defense.&quot;Â  State v. Wigington, 375 S.C. 25, 31, 649 S.E.2d 185,\r\n  188 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  When any evidence in the record entitles the accused to a\r\n  jury charge on self-defense, a trial judge's refusal to give the charge is\r\n  reversible error. Â State v. Muller, 282 S.C. 10, 10, 316 S.E.2d 409, 409\r\n  (1984).Â  \r\nA self-defense charge is only required when the evidence supports\r\n  it.Â  State v. Slater, 373 S.C. 66, 69, 644 S.E.2d 50, 52 (2007).Â  The\r\n  State then bears the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303\r\n  (2002).Â  \r\n\r\n\tTo establish self-defense in South Carolina, four elements must be\r\n  present: (1) the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty;\r\n  (2) the defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life\r\n  or sustaining serious bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was\r\n  in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3)\r\n  if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent danger, defendant must show\r\n  that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have\r\n  entertained the belief that he was actually in imminent danger and that the\r\n  circumstances were such as would warrant a person of ordinary prudence,\r\n  firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in order to save himself from\r\n  serious bodily harm or the loss of his life; and (4) the defendant had no other\r\n  probable means of avoiding the danger. \r\n\r\nSlater, 373 S.C. at 69-70, 644 S.E.2d at 52.Â \r\n  &quot;Any act of the accused in violation of law and reasonably calculated to\r\n  produce the occasion amounts to bringing on the difficulty and bars his right\r\n  to assert self-defense as a justification or excuse for a homicide.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 345, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999).Â  An accused who\r\n  provokes or initiates an assault cannot claim self-defense unless he both\r\n  withdraws from the conflict and communicates his withdrawal by word or act to\r\n  his adversary.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe reverse\r\n  the trial court's decision not to instruct the jury on self-defense because\r\n  some evidence exists to support a self-defense charge and because the facts in\r\n  this case are similar to those in a South Carolina Supreme Court case in which\r\n  a self-defense charge was found to be proper.Â  See State v. Taylor,\r\n  356 S.C. 227, 589 S.E.2d 1 (2003).Â  The trial court did not articulate a\r\n  specific basis for its decision at the time it ruled.Â  However, oral argument on\r\n  Jackson's request for a jury charge focused on the first and last elements of\r\n  self-defense.Â  A jury could have found Jackson satisfied those elements and\r\n  should have had the opportunity to consider self-defense.Â  \r\nA\r\n  jury could reasonably have found Jackson was not at fault for the fight because\r\n  no evidence indicated he acted &quot;in violation of law&quot; and in a manner\r\n  &quot;reasonably calculated to produce the occasion&quot; until after he became\r\n  embroiled in the fight.Â  See id.Â  The eyewitness testimony\r\n  supports very different theories of fault.Â  Felder and Mother were already\r\n  arguing before Jackson attempted to convince Mother to leave the yard with\r\n  him.Â  Seeing the dangerous level of tension between Mother and Felder, Jackson\r\n  instructed Felder not to touch Mother.Â  Mother pushed Felder, he shoved her to\r\n  the ground, and the men began to fight.Â  No testimony indicated whether Jackson\r\n  or Felder threw the first punch.Â  Under one theory, Jackson could have\r\n  assaulted Felder, thereby negating his right to argue self-defense.Â  However,\r\n  under another equally viable theory, Felder, already angry from his interaction\r\n  with Mother, could have assaulted Jackson when Jackson stepped between Jackson\r\n  and Mother.Â  Because a jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that\r\n  Felder assaulted Jackson, a refusal to charge self-defense on the basis of\r\n  fault would have been reversible error.Â  See State v. Muller, 282 S.C. 10, 10, 316 S.E.2d 409, 409\r\n  (1984).Â  \r\nA\r\n  jury also could have found Jackson had no other probable means of preventing\r\n  serious bodily injury or death once the fight began.Â  Unless the incident\r\n  occurred in the accused's home or business or on the curtilage thereof, the\r\n  accused generally has a duty to retreat.Â  State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C.\r\n  538, 548 n.15, 500 S.E.2d 489, 494 n.15 (1998).Â  This incident occurred on ground between Jackson's and\r\n  Felder's trailers, with the climax playing out against the outer wall of\r\n  Felder's trailer.Â  Consequently, Jackson had a duty to retreat if possible.Â \r\n  However, testimony indicated at the time Jackson stabbed Felder, Felder was in\r\n  a superior position to Jackson, had pinned him against a wall, and was\r\n  continuing to beat him.[4]Â \r\n  There was also testimony that Felder himself had the knife at one point during\r\n  the fight.Â  Therefore, a jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that at\r\n  the time he made the decision to stab Felder, Jackson had no other means of\r\n  extricating himself, and a refusal to charge self-defense on the basis of\r\n  failure to retreat would have been reversible error.Â  See Muller,\r\n  282 S.C. at 10, 316 S.E.2d at 409.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  although the issues on appeal differ, the facts of this case are similar to\r\n  those in State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 589 S.E.2d 1 (2003).Â  There, Taylor\r\n  witnessed a violent and escalating argument between a man named Kevin and a\r\n  woman.Â  Id. at 229, 589 S.E.2d at 2.Â  Kevin pushed the woman, and Taylor\r\n  intervened in an attempt to stop the altercation.Â  Id.Â  Witnesses\r\n  disagreed about who started the fight between Taylor and Kevin.Â  Id.Â  At\r\n  the homeowner's insistence, the two men took their fight outside.Â  Id. at 230, 589 S.E.2d at 2.Â  At some point during the outdoor portion of the\r\n  fight, Taylor took a buck knife from his pocket and stabbed Kevin a total of\r\n  fifteen times.Â  Id.Â  Kevin died of a stab wound to the heart.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Taylor court considered whether the trial court properly charged the\r\n  jury on both self-defense and mutual combat.Â  Id. at 231-34, 589 S.E.2d\r\n  at 3-5.Â  No exception was taken to the charge on self-defense; rather, the\r\n  supreme court held the mutual combat charge negated the self-defense charge and\r\n  created unfair prejudice against Taylor.[5]Â  Id. at 235, 589 S.E.2d at 5.Â  The supreme court specifically found the\r\n  trial court properly charged self-defense.Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Jackson intervened as peacemaker in an escalating argument between Mother and\r\n  Felder.Â  After Felder pushed Mother to the ground, Jackson and Felder began to\r\n  fight, although no evidence indicates which man threw the first punch.Â  Felder\r\n  eventually pinned Jackson against the wall of a mobile home, preventing his\r\n  escape.Â  Fearing Felder would not stop hitting him, Jackson took from his\r\n  pocket the pocketknife he used for work.Â  Jackson stabbed Felder eight times,\r\n  killing him.[6]Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the supreme court's finding concerning the propriety of charging self-defense\r\n  in Taylor is dicta, it is nonetheless instructive in the case at bar.Â \r\n  In both cases, the accused stepped into a fight in progress with the intent of\r\n  stopping the violence but instead became a participant and killed the man he\r\n  fought.Â  However, in Taylor, the accused was not closely related to the\r\n  woman whose place he took in the fight.Â  In addition, the accused in Taylor may have had an opportunity to retreat at the time the men removed their fight\r\n  from the house to the yard.Â  If the evidence merited a self-defense charge\r\n  under those circumstances, it should do so here as well.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dissent notes that the defense of others was not an issue on appeal but\r\n  proceeds to analyze that doctrine in part.Â  We do not turn our disposition on that\r\n  doctrine.Â  We find only that more than one reasonable inference may be drawn as\r\n  to whether the accused was the aggressor or provoked the assault and that these\r\n  inferences must be resolved by the jury, not the court.Â  In our view, the\r\n  testimony cited by the dissent does not demonstrate that the defendant provoked\r\n  the assault nor does it establish who the aggressor was in this situation. We\r\n  also respectfully disagree that we may conclude from this record that it was\r\n  &quot;apparent&quot; why the defense of others was not asserted on appeal.Â  To\r\n  do so would amount to speculation on our part and it would be inappropriate to\r\n  resolve this issue on such speculation.Â  Accordingly, we respectfully disagree\r\n  with our learned colleague and suggest the matter is more appropriately\r\n  resolved by the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find\r\n  Jackson failed to preserve the trial court's exclusion of evidence for\r\n  appellate review and therefore affirm that decision.Â However, we find the trial court erred in refusing to  charge the jury on self-defense, and thus we reverse the conviction for  voluntary manslaughter.&nbsp; Because we reverse the voluntary manslaughter conviction, we  necessarily must reverse the conviction for the weapon  charge.&nbsp; Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., concurs and CURETON, A.J., dissents.Â  \r\nCURETON,\r\n  A.J., dissenting:Â  Because\r\n  I believe the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is\r\n  that Jackson was not faultless in &quot;bringing on the difficulty&quot;\r\n  between him and Felder, he was not entitled to a charge on self-defense.Â  I\r\n  would therefore affirm.\r\nI note\r\n  initially that although Jackson's principal argument at trial was that he had a\r\n  right to defend his mother, he has not asserted on appeal that he was entitled\r\n  to the self-defense charge because he was defending his mother.Â  It is apparent\r\n  that the reason he has not done so is due\r\n  to the fact that, as admitted at trial, his mother was the person who started\r\n  the fight with Felder, thus, bringing on the difficulty. \r\nI believe Jackson's\r\n  status in reference to his right to a self-defense charge is summed up in his\r\n  own testimony.Â  In response to his counsel's questions, he responded on direct\r\n  examination as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.\r\n\t\t\tDid you ever say anything to him about pushing your \r\n\t\t\tmother? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Yes, sir. I told him not to touch her. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.\r\n\t\t\tThen what happened? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tBecause she was in between us and real close.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tSo, I was likeâ€”and I seen the expression on his face like he was \r\n\t\t\tready to hit her.&nbsp; So, I was like don't touch her. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.\r\n\t\t\tThen what happened? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tHe hit her and we started fighting. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.\r\n\t\t\tAnd were y'all all on the ground when you say he \r\n\t\t\thit her? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t* * * \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tâ€¦ How long after your mother was pushed did you and [Felder] begin to fight?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tImmediately.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t* * * \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tDid you feel the need to protect your mother?&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tYes, sir, I did.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tâ€¦ Before the fight began why didn't you just run \r\n\t\t\taway? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tBecause I was scared.&nbsp; I mean, if I would have \r\n\t\t\tran away, I mean, by her being drunk and him being him that she was \r\n\t\t\tgoing to get it.&nbsp; He was going to jump on her.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Jackson's sister, Elizabeth Jackson, testified:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tGoing back, could you tell us because I'm not entirely sure, the pushing\r\n  between your mother and Andrew Felder, can you tell us again from the start how\r\n  the physical contact [between Mother and Felder] occurred? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tMy\r\n  mother pushed [Felder] first, and he replied to her not to touch him again.Â \r\n  She pushed him again, and he pushed her, and when he hit her, she hit the\r\n  ground, and my brother came in, and that's how they started fighting.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAn\r\n  accused who &quot;provokes or initiates an assault&quot; cannot claim\r\n  self-defense unless he both withdraws from the conflict and communicates his\r\n  withdrawal by word or act to his adversary.Â  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C.\r\n  340, 345, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999).Â  Under the theory of defense of others,\r\n  one is not guilty of taking the life of an assailant who assaults a friend,\r\n  relative, or bystander if that friend, relative or bystander would likewise\r\n  have the right to take the life of the assailant in self-defense.Â  State v.\r\n    Long, 325 S.C. 59, 64, 480 S.E.2d 62, 64 (1997).Â  Moreover, one cannot\r\n  justify a homicide on the ground of necessity in the defense of another when\r\n  the other person could not have asserted self-defense by reason of having\r\n  provoked the encounter.Â  40 Am. Jur. 2d Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Homicide, Â§ 168 (2008).\r\nI\r\n  would affirm the trial court's decision not to instruct the jury on\r\n  self-defense because there is no evidence to support a self-defense charge.Â  It\r\n  is undisputed that Felder and Mother were already arguing before Jackson\r\n  attempted to convince Mother to leave Felder's house with him.Â  Aware of theÂ \r\n  level of tension between Mother and Felder, Jackson virtually dared FelderÂ  to\r\n  touch Mother.Â  After Mother pushed Felder, he shoved her to the ground.Â \r\n  Thereafter, according to the uncontradicted testimony of Jackson's sister,\r\n  Jackson &quot;came in&quot; and the fight began immediately.Â  While the\r\n  majority states that a reasonable inference from the testimony is that Felder\r\n  assaulted Jackson and thus was the aggressor, I do not think that is a reasonable\r\n  inference to be drawn from the evidence.Â  I would hold that, unlike StateÂ \r\n    v. Taylor, where the defendant testified the decedent &quot;threw the first\r\n  punch,&quot; the only reasonable inference the jury could adduce from the\r\n  testimony in this case is that Jackson intervened in an ongoing altercation\r\n  between Mother and Felder to protect his mother who admittedly was at fault in\r\n  bringing on the difficulty.Â  Because Jackson stepped into the shoes of his\r\n  mother, he was not entitled to a charge on self-defense.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Felder sustained eight stab wounds and nine cuts.Â  \r\n[2] Although Jackson identified in which garbage can he\r\n  threw his shirt and pocketknife, they were not recovered because the garbage\r\n  was picked up before police checked the can.Â Â Â  \r\n[3] The threshold issue is whether Jackson attempted to\r\n  proffer the evidence, rather than whether his attempt succeeded.Â  The rule regarding proffers has been relaxed where the\r\n  trial court refuses to allow a proffer and the record clearly demonstrates\r\n  prejudice, or where the appellate court is able to determine from the record\r\n  what the testimony was intended to show and that prejudice clearly exists.Â  Jamison\r\n    v.

Rutledge Young contends the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (CZMAP)\r\n  erred in accepting and adopting the Administrative Law Judge's findings of fact\r\n  and conclusions of law.Â  Specifically, Young alleges CZMAP, in upholding the\r\n  disputed permit, erred in (1) declining to find the Administrative Law Court\r\n  (ALC) made an error of law in deciding the case under incorrect regulations;\r\n  (2) declining to find the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental\r\n  Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) abused its discretion\r\n  in failing to exercise discretion when issuing the disputed permit; and (3)\r\n  declining to find OCRM abused its discretion when not considering the\r\n  cumulative effect of a boatlift included in the permit application.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn April 5,\r\n  2005, Samuel M. Riddle, III, submitted an application to OCRM to construct a\r\n  private recreational dock in Church Creek originating from Lot 11-D on Lonnie\r\n  Taylor Lane in Wadmalaw Island.Â  According to the application, the proposed\r\n  project was to include a 10-foot by 15-foot four-pile boatlift.Â  Public notice\r\n  of the permit application was published on April 21, 2005.Â  \r\nOn May 3, 2005,\r\n  Young, who owns property two lots away from Lot 11-D, notified OCRM in writing\r\n  of his objection to the proposed permit.Â  Among the objections to the permit\r\n  was Young's complaint that the proposed boatlift would interfere with his view of\r\n  Church Creek.Â  In support of his position, Young asserted there were only five\r\n  docks on the Wadmalaw side of Church Creek, none of which had mechanical\r\n  boatlifts.Â  Young also contended a drive-on floating dock was an available\r\n  alternative that would cause less interference with his view.\r\nOCRM issued a conditional\r\n  dock permit on June 10, 2005, and validated the permit on June 15, 2005.Â  The\r\n  conditional permit noted that &quot;[a] 10' by 15' four-pile boatlift will be\r\n  located on the downstream side of the pierhead.&quot;Â  Boyce and Carol Miller\r\n  bought Lot 11-D on June 21, 2005, and were later substituted for Riddle as\r\n  respondents of record in this case. \r\nThe\r\n  pertinent regulation in effect when the permit was issued gave OCRM the right\r\n  to consider allowing an applicant to have a boat storage dock in lieu of a\r\n  boatlift; however, on June 24, 2005, it was amended to give the permit\r\n  applicant the option of a boatlift or a storage dock.[1]\r\nOn June 12,\r\n  2006, the ALC held a hearing in the matter.Â  By order dated August 21, 2006,\r\n  the ALC upheld OCRM's decision to issue the permit for the dock with the\r\n  boatlift.\r\nOn August 30,\r\n  2006, Young appealed the ALC decision to CZMAP.Â  CZMAP heard oral arguments in\r\n  the matter on June 22, 2007, and on August 17, 2007, affirmed the ALC. Â This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp; Did CZMAP err in declining to hold\r\n  the ALC decided this case using regulations that were not in effect when OCRM\r\n  considered the permit application?\r\nII.&nbsp; Did CZMAP err in declining to hold\r\n  OCRM abused its discretion in failing to exercise discretion when issuing the\r\n  disputed permit?\r\nIII.&nbsp; Did CZMAP err declining to hold\r\n  OCRM abused its discretion in not considering the cumulative effect of the\r\n  proposed boatlift as required by its own regulation?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  contested permitting cases, the ALC serves as the finder of fact.&quot;Â  Neal\r\n    v. Brown, 374 S.C. 641, 648, 649 S.E.2d 164, 167 (Ct. App. 2007), cert.\r\n      granted May 30, 2008.Â  On appeal to CZMAP, the standard of review is\r\n  whether substantial evidence supports the ALC's findings.Â  Id.Â  &quot;A\r\n  proceeding before the ALJ is in the nature of a de novo hearing, including the\r\n  presentation of evidence and testimony, rather than an appellate\r\n  proceeding.&quot;Â  Brownlee v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Env'tl Control,\r\n  372 S.C. 119, 125, 641 S.E.2d 45, 48 (Ct. App. 2007), rev'd on other grounds Op. No. 26620 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Mar. 30, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at\r\n  11).\r\nJudicial\r\n  review of CZMAP's decision by this Court is governed by the prior version of section\r\n  1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code, under which the court &quot;may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if the substantial rights of the appellant have\r\n  been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or\r\n  decisions are\r\n\r\n\t(a) Â in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\t. .\r\n  .\r\n\t(d) affected\r\n  by other error of law;\r\n\t(e) clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record; or\r\n\t(f)\r\n  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion \r\n\t. .\r\n  . .&quot;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(a)(6)\r\n  (2005).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when a ruling is based on an error\r\n  of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 300, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Applicable Regulations\r\nYoung\r\n  first argues CZMAP should have reversed the order issued by the ALC because the\r\n  ALC based its decision on regulations that were not in effect when the permit\r\n  application came before OCRM.Â  We hold this issue was not preserved for\r\n  appellate review.\r\nA court has a\r\n  limited scope of review of the final decisions of administrative agencies and\r\n  cannot ordinarily consider issues that were not raised to and ruled on by the\r\n  agency from which an appeal is taken.Â  See Kiawah Resort Assocs. v.\r\n    S.C. Tax Comm'n, 318 S.C. 502, 505, 458 S.E.2d 542, 544 (1995) (applying\r\n  this rule to judicial review by the circuit court of an administrative agency\r\n  decision).Â  &quot;[E]very ground of appeal ought to be distinctly stated that\r\n  the Court may at once see the point which it is called upon to decide without\r\n  having to 'grope in the dark' to ascertain the precise point at issue.&quot;Â  Boyer\r\n    v. Loftin-Woodard, Inc.., 247 S.C. 167, 170-71, 146 S.E.2d 606, 607 (1966); see also Home Med. Sys. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, Op. No. 26638\r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 20, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 25, 31)\r\n  (emphasizing that issue preservation is required in administrative appeals and\r\n  holding &quot;Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions are permitted in ALC proceedings&quot;).Â Â  \r\nIn his brief to CZMAP, Young merely referenced the regulation he now asserts was applicable to\r\n  this controversy and never specifically asserted error in the ALC's failure to\r\n  follow the correct version in reaching its decision.Â  Moreover, as he admitted\r\n  in his brief to this Court, the reference contained a typographical error. Â Even\r\n  if, as Young asserted during oral argument, the correct citation to the\r\n  regulation should have been evident to those familiar with this case, we do not\r\n  agree with Young that such a passing reference sufficed to bring this issue to\r\n  the attention of CZMAP.Â  Cf. Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354,\r\n  379, 527 S.E.2d 742, 755 (2000) (concerning a final decision of an\r\n  administrative law judge in an appeal from the final decision of the Department\r\n  of Corrections wherein the supreme court stated &quot;the inmate's petition to\r\n  the circuit court must distinctly and specifically direct the court's attention\r\n  to the errors or abuses allegedly committed by the ALC. . . . A mere expression\r\n  of dissatisfaction with the ruling is not sufficient.&quot;).\r\nII.&nbsp; OCRM's Alleged Failure to Exercise\r\n  Discretion\r\nYoung\r\n  next asserts the order of the ALC should have been reversed on the ground that\r\n  OCRM failed to exercise its statutorily required discretion when it approved\r\n  the dock permit application.Â  Specifically, Young contends OCRM failed to\r\n  consider (1) the individual merits of the permit application, (2) certain\r\n  legislative declaration of findings and state policy, and (3) the extent to\r\n  which the proposed boatlift could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent\r\n  owners such as himself.[2]Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nUnder\r\n  section 48-39-150 of the South Carolina Code, OCRM must consider certain\r\n  criteria in deciding whether to approve or deny a permit.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  48-39-150 (1987 &amp; Supp. 2006).Â  Section 48-39-150 references the three\r\n  factors that Young asserts were not given adequate attention by OCRM when it\r\n  approved the Millers' dock permit; however, based on our view of the record, we\r\n  hold Young did not meet his burden to show OCRM disregarded the relevant\r\n  statutory prerequisites when it considered the Millers' application.Â  See Hoffman v. Greenville County, 242 S.C. 34, 39, 129 S.E.2d 757, 760\r\n  (1963) (&quot;The burden of proof is upon the party who by the pleadings has\r\n  the affirmative on the issue.&quot;).\r\nYoung maintains OCRM's decision was motivated by the presence of other boatlifts in the\r\n  vicinity and cites evidence suggesting OCRM personnel operated under the belief\r\n  that authorization of boatlifts meeting certain size requirements was\r\n  mandatory, including a handwritten notation in the permitting document\r\n  indicating the boat lift had to be authorized because its dimensions did not\r\n  count against the total square footage of the dock.Â  We have found nothing in\r\n  the record, however, identifying who made this notation or suggesting that\r\n  OCRM's decision to allow the boatlift was based solely on the size of the\r\n  boatlift or the recognition that there were other boatlifts in the area.Â  To\r\n  the contrary, Curtis Joyner, OCRM's Manager of Critical Area Permitting,\r\n  testified that in addition to boatlifts, the area in question already had pier\r\n  heads and floating docks.Â  He further stated the proposed dock was a very\r\n  reasonably sized dock compared to other docks in the area and fitted within the\r\n  general character of the area.Â  Although Joyner candidly admitted that he would\r\n  have been influenced by what boat storage structures were already present in\r\n  the area, he had in the past modified a permit based on view impact. \r\nYoung next\r\n  complains that, as required by section 48-39-150(A) of the South Carolina Code, OCRM did not base its determination on the policies stated in sections 48-39-20\r\n  and 48-39-30.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  Young's argument on this point appears to focus on Joyner's\r\n  acknowledgement that he never distinguished Wadmalaw Island from other more\r\n  developed areas when considering the permit application.Â  This admission,\r\n  however, does not nullify the fact that OCRM, in determining whether or not to\r\n  allow the proposed dock, considered the presence of comparable structures in\r\n  the area as well as whether the dock satisfied all statutory and regulatory requirements.Â \r\n  Moreover, as Joyner testified, heightened protection for the area would be\r\n  available through the creation of a special area management plan, zoning, or\r\n  enactment of appropriate local ordinances.\r\n\r\nWe also\r\n  reject Young's argument that OCRM failed to consider the extent to which the\r\n  proposed boatlift could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners such\r\n  as himself.Â  In support of this argument, Young cites a recent case from the\r\n  supreme court for the proposition that recreational pursuits conferred standing\r\n  on the petitioner to challenge a permit issued by OCRM for &quot;beach sand\r\n  scraping&quot; from a public intertidal beach. Â See Smiley v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 374 S.C. 326, 331-33, 649 S.E.2d 31,\r\n  34 (2007).Â Â  In the present case, however, the issue not whether aesthetic\r\n  concerns and recreational activities are appropriate factors to consider in\r\n  evaluating the propriety of the proposed boat storage dock but whether the\r\n  issues Young raised were in fact given adequate attention during the permitting\r\n  process.Â  We hold OCRM gave sufficient consideration to Young's reasons opposing\r\n  the boatlift.Â  \r\nHere, Young's interests in view alone are limited under South\r\n  Carolina law.Â  See Hill v. Beach Co., 279 S.C. 313, 315, 306\r\n  S.E.2d 604, 605 (1983) (noting prescriptive rights to ocean views, breezes,\r\n  light, and air do not exist in South Carolina).Â  Furthermore, there is a\r\n  regulation minimizing the visual impact of boatlifts by prohibiting their enclosure.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(e)(iii) (Supp. 2005).[4]Â  We therefore agree with DHEC that\r\n  OCRM gave adequate attention to Young's interests and rights when it balanced\r\n  the factors for and against the permit.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; OCRM's\r\n  Evaluation of Cumulative Effects\r\nFinally, Young argues OCRM's alleged failure to consider the\r\n  cumulative effects of the proposed boatlift amounted to a violation of its own\r\n  administrative regulation.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn deciding permit applications, OCRM must be guided by\r\n  &quot;[t]he extent to which long-range, cumulative effects of the project may\r\n  result within the context of other possible development and the general\r\n  character of the area.&quot;Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-11(C)(1) (Supp. 2003).[5]Â  \r\nTo support his assertion that OCRM failed to consider the\r\n  long-range, cumulative effects of the proposed boatlift within the context of\r\n  other possible development, Young points to (1) Joyner's testimony that all\r\n  owners of adjacent and nearby properties would be granted boatlifts if they\r\n  applied for them; (2) Joyner's acknowledgment that a proliferation of boatlifts\r\n  in a reasonably small area could alter the visual aspects of the area; (3)\r\n  evidence that OCRM personnel felt compelled to allow all applications for\r\n  boatlifts so long as the boatlifts were of proper dimensions; and (4) the\r\n  absence of any notation or evidence in OCRM's file regarding the cumulative\r\n  effect of a boatlift in the area.Â  This evidence, however, does not necessarily\r\n  warrant a finding that inadequate attention was given to the cumulative effects\r\n  of the proposed boatlift within the context of other possible development and\r\n  the general character of the area.Â  As noted by the ALC, the area surrounding\r\n  Young's property is not a &quot;pristine wilderness, unmarked by docks and\r\n  piers, but is a creek familiar with development, including docks with boatlifts\r\n  and other boat storage methods.&quot;Â  There is no evidence that any negative\r\n  impact of the proposed boatlift would be any greater than that of other boat\r\n  storage structures.Â  Given these considerations, we hold that Young has not\r\n  carried his burden to show OCRM violated Regulation 30-11(C)(1).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we affirm CZMAP's decision to adopt the ALC's order upholding\r\n  the issuance of the Millers' dock permit.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The prior regulation provided in pertinent part that\r\n  &quot;[b]oat storage docks will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may\r\n  be permitted in lieu of elevated boatlifts.&quot;Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(q)(viii) (Supp. 2003).Â  Under the 2005 changes, applicants were\r\n  granted the right &quot;to choose either one boat lift or one boat storage dock\r\n  with an impact area not to exceed 160 square feet that will not count against\r\n  the total allowable dock square footage.&quot;Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(c) (Supp. 2005).\r\n[2]&nbsp; The ALC determined that although Young's property\r\n  was not contiguous to the Millers' property, Young was still an adjacent owner.\r\n[3]Â  In section 48-39-20 of the South Carolina Code, the\r\n  South Carolina General Assembly enumerated various findings concerning the\r\n  importance of developing a statewide management program to regulate development\r\n  in the coastal zone &quot;in light of competing demands and the urgent need to\r\n  protect and to give high priority to natural systems in the coastal zone while\r\n  balancing economic interests.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-20(F) (1987 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2006).Â  In section 48-39-30, the General Assembly declared &quot;the\r\n  basic state policy . . . to protect the quality of the coastal environment and\r\n  to promote the economic and social improvement of the coastal zone and of all\r\n  the people of the State.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 48-39-30(A).\r\n[4]Â  This regulation was still in effect in 2008.Â  See S.C. CodeÂ  Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(e)(iii) (Supp. 2008).\r\n[5]Â  This regulation has not changed since 2003.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4556","title":"Murphy v.

Â Tyndall\r\n  and Watts testified Tyndall had performed headlight restoration services for\r\n  E-Z Credit on occasions in the past.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Don Juan Lewis testified that at the scene of the accident, Tyndall said:\r\n  &quot;Well I just left the shop around there, and I was going right here to\r\n  NAPA to get some parts, and I was going right back to the shop.&quot;Â  The\r\n  record shows Tyndall purchased nuts, washers, and regal blue paint or dye at McKenzies' Parts and Equipment just prior to the accident.Â  The register\r\n  receipt shows the items were charged to E-Z Credit's account and specifically\r\n  notes, &quot;Attention:Â  Donnie.&quot;\r\nOfficer Kenneth O'Neal Smith testified\r\n  he spoke with Tyndall at the scene to ascertain where he would be later that\r\n  afternoon.Â  Smith stated Tyndall &quot;said he was going back to work.Â  He had\r\n  just went to NAPA to pick up some parts.&quot;Â  Smith indicated he delivered\r\n  Tyndall's copy of the accident report to him at E-Z Credit later that\r\n  afternoon.Â  Tyndall also provided E-Z Credit's phone number as well as his cell\r\n  phone number for the accident report.Â  \r\nA witness at the scene, Lajarvious\r\n  Javonta' Buie testified he overheard Tyndall say, &quot;I work for Allen\r\n  Watts.Â  I was just trying to make it to the car lot.&quot;Â  Buie clarified\r\n  Tyndall said he worked at Alan Watts' shop.Â  Buie also testified Tyndall was\r\n  wearing dirty clothes like he had been working at the time of the accident.Â  \r\nMurphy\r\n  sued Tyndall and E-Z Credit alleging Tyndall was acting as an agent or employee\r\n  for E-Z Credit and was acting within the course and scope of that employment or\r\n  agency at the time of the collision. Â E-Z Credit filed a motion for summary\r\n  judgment contending there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding\r\n  Tyndall's employment status at the time of the accident.Â  \r\nIn support of its summary judgment\r\n  motion, E-Z Credit presented Tyndall's testimony that he had never been\r\n  employed by E-Z Credit and he was not doing subcontract work for E-Z Credit the\r\n  day of the accident.Â  Tyndall further testified he purchased some replacement\r\n  parts for the Mitsubishi at NAPA and, with Watt's permission as part of their\r\n  sales transaction, charged the parts to E-Z's account.Â  \r\nE-Z also produced documentation of the\r\n  sales transaction that was presented to Officer Lewis at the scene approximately\r\n  thirty-five minutes after the accident occurred.[1]Â \r\n  Via affidavit, Watts corroborated Tyndall's testimony regarding Tyndall's\r\n  dealings with E-Z Credit on the day of the accident, as did two E-Z Credit\r\n  employees. Â E-Z Credit also produced invoices and checks regarding E-Z Credit\r\n  and Tyndall's business relationship in the past.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment\r\n  in E-Z Credit's favor finding &quot;the only reasonable inference to be drawn\r\n  from the facts in the record is that Tyndall's actions at the time in question\r\n  were taken for his own independent purposes and not with reference to any\r\n  service to E-Z.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the trial court's grant\r\n  of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard found in\r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Boyd v. Bellsouth Tel. Tel. Co., 369 S.C. 410, 415,\r\n  633 S.E.2d 136, 138 (2006). Summary judgment\r\n  is proper when no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  On\r\n  summary judgment, the court's task is not to try issues of fact but to\r\n  determine if genuine issues of material fact exist.Â  Thomas Sand Co. v.\r\n    Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 408, 563 S.E.2d 109, 112 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  &quot;The problem besetting courts lies in deciding what is or what is\r\n  not a 'genuine issue as to any material fact.'&quot;Â  Spencer v. Miller,\r\n  259 S.C. 453, 456, 192 S.E.2d 863, 864 (1972). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMurphy contends the circuit court erred\r\n  in granting summary judgment in favor of E-Z Credit.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Because it is a drastic remedy,\r\n  summary judgment should be cautiously invoked so no person will be improperly\r\n  deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.&quot;Â  Carolina Alliance\r\n    for Fair Employment v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation,\r\n  337 S.C. 476, 485, 523 S.E.2d 795, 799 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Additionally,\r\n  even where there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, but only as to the\r\n  conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should not be\r\n  granted.&quot;Â  Hill v. York County Sheriff's Dep't, 313 S.C. 303, 305,\r\n  437 S.E.2d 179, 180 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In determining whether a triable issue of\r\n  fact exists, the evidence and reasonable inferences from it must be viewed in\r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth.\r\n    ofÂ  S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  When evidence is\r\n  susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the issue should be\r\n  submitted to the jury.Â  Vaughan v. Town of Lyman, 370 S.C. 436, 448, 635\r\n  S.E.2d 631, 638 (2006).Â  &quot;At the summary judgment stage of the\r\n  proceedings, it is only necessary for the nonmoving party to submit a scintilla\r\n  of evidence warranting determination by a jury for summary judgment to be\r\n  denied.&quot;Â  Hill, 313 S.C. at 308, 437 S.E.2d at 182; see also Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803\r\n  (2009) (clarifying and reaffirming in cases applying the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence burden of proof, the nonmoving party is only required to submit a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment).\r\nIn the instant case, we believe Murphy\r\n  has set forth at least a mere scintilla of evidence that Tyndall was E-Z\r\n  Credit's employee or agent or was working on behalf of E-Z Credit at the time\r\n  of the accident.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Murphy,\r\n  Tyndall stated at the accident scene he worked for Watts, owner of E-Z Credit.Â \r\n  While Tyndall could have meant he performed headlight restoration for E-Z\r\n  Credit periodically, that is not what he stated.Â  A jury could reasonably draw\r\n  more than one inference from the statement.Â  Likewise, Tyndall told Officer\r\n  Smith &quot;he was going back to work.&quot;Â  Again, Tyndall may have meant he\r\n  was returning to work on his newly purchased car, but a jury could reasonably\r\n  draw an alternative inference from his statement.Â  Furthermore, Tyndall gave\r\n  E-Z Credit's phone number as a contact number for him, and Murphy testified he\r\n  had seen Tyndall around E-Z Credit washing cars.Â  Officer Lewis also\r\n  testified that while on patrol he had seen Tyndall &quot;working [at E-Z Credit]\r\n  cleaning up cars,&quot; although he did not have any direct knowledge of\r\n  Tyndall's employment status with E-Z Credit.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the receipt from NAPA auto\r\n  parts shows Tyndall bought three items just before the accident: nuts, washers,\r\n  and blue paint or dye.Â  The record contains no clear testimony that explains\r\n  how the blue paint would be used in the restoration or repair of Tyndall's\r\n  silver Mitsubishi.[3]Â \r\n  Therefore, a jury could draw the inference Tyndall was purchasing the items for\r\n  E-Z Credit as part of his employee duties or as part of a special errand on E-Z\r\n  Credit's behalf.Â  Additionally, two of E-Z Credit's employees testified they\r\n  were not aware of E-Z Credit ever allowing customers to purchase parts on the\r\n  business's NAPA account.Â  \r\nWith respect to payment, the record\r\n  shows Tyndall received a 1099 tax form from E-Z Credit in 2006.Â  The record\r\n  also shows Tyndall received checks made to him personally on a weekly basis for\r\n  the period from July 7, 2006 through August 4, 2006.Â  Some of the checks\r\n  contain &quot;subcontractor&quot; in the memo line, but some contain\r\n  &quot;advances&quot; in the memo line.Â  A jury could interpret the regularity\r\n  of the checks and the term &quot;advances&quot; to mean there was more than an infrequent\r\n  independent contractor relationship between Tyndall and E-Z Credit.\r\nFinally, issues\r\n  of credibility are generally for a jury's determination.Â  See Anderson v. The\r\n    Augusta Chronicle, 355 S.C. 461, 475, 585 S.E.2d 506, 513 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n  (stating credibility determinations and the drawing of legitimate inferences\r\n  from the facts are jury functions).Â  In this case, all the testimony\r\n  corroborating E-Z Credit's position is from E-Z Credit employees, E-Z Credit's\r\n  owner, or Tyndall himself.Â  Tyndall has admittedly done work for E-Z Credit\r\n  through his headlight restoration business, and Tyndall is a tenant in a home\r\n  owned by Watts.Â  Furthermore, Tyndall is receiving Social Security Disability\r\n  and would benefit by appearing to have less income.Â  With that in mind, a jury\r\n  could reasonably infer bias on the part of the witnesses and find their\r\n  testimonies to be less than credible. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhen viewing the facts and all\r\n  reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable\r\n  to him, we find Murphy presented at least a mere scintilla of evidence Tyndall\r\n  was working for E-Z Credit at the time of the accident thereby precluding\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Accordingly the judgment of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Officer Smith\r\n  required documentation of the sales transaction at the scene because the\r\n  vehicle was being operated without a license plate at the time of the\r\n  accident.Â  \r\n[2] The circuit\r\n  court's order relies heavily upon Bravis v. Dunbar, 316 S.C. 263, 449\r\n  S.E.2d 495 (Ct. App. 1994), finding Murphy failed to produce more than a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence regarding Tyndall's employment status.Â  However, the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court abrogated Bravis in Hancock v. Mid-South\r\n    Management Co., 381 S.C. 326, 673 S.E.2d 801 (2009).\r\n[3] E-Z Credit's\r\n  attorney stated at one point Tyndall was going to dye the inside door panel of\r\n  the Mitsubishi.Â  However, the item is frequently referred to in the record as\r\n  blue spray paint.Â  Josh Watts, son of Allen Watts and an employee in the E-Z\r\n  Credit shop, testified he repaired the Mitsubishi after the collision and used\r\n  silver paint for the exterior.Â  He indicated one would not paint the interior\r\n  of a car but would dye it.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4557","title":"State v.

Douglas Brannon, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney\r\n  General, of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.: Bradley Dye (Dye) appeals his conviction\r\n  for second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Dye claims the circuit\r\n  court should have excluded his confession at trial because it was the product\r\n  of police coercion and the circuit court did not articulate the relevant\r\n  findings to establish his confession was voluntarily given.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 8, 2004, Dye's twelve-year-old daughter\r\n  (Daughter) reported to the police that her father had sexually abused her on\r\n  several occasions between 2000 and 2003.[1]Â \r\n  On that day, Officer Nikki Cantrell (Officer Cantrell) interviewed Daughter,\r\n  who then gave the police a brief handwritten statement.Â  Soon thereafter,\r\n  Daughter again met with Officer Cantrell, at which time Daughter recounted her\r\n  allegations of abuse and signed a statement detailing those allegations.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  result of Daughter's statements, Officer Cantrell went to Dye's home and asked\r\n  Dye if he would be willing to come to the police station for an interview.Â  Dye\r\n  agreed, and on September 30, 2004, Dye met Officer Cantrell at the police\r\n  station.Â  Officer Cantrell testified that she had not told Dye the purpose or\r\n  nature of the prospective interview before he came to the police station.Â  Dye\r\n  arrived at approximately 8 p.m. and followed Officer Cantrell into an interview\r\n  room.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to questioning Dye, Officer Cantrell read him a pre-interrogation waiver of\r\n  rights form.Â  Officer Cantrell testified at the Jackson v. Denno[2] hearing that after she read him each right, she\r\n  would ask him if he understood that right, and when he said he did, he would\r\n  then initial on that line.Â  After he indicated that he understood all of his\r\n  rights, she then asked him again whether he understood them, and he responded in\r\n  the affirmative.Â  Officer Cantrell stated that they read the waiver of\r\n  rights portion of the form together and that Dye indicated by his signature that\r\n  he understood he was not being threatened or forced into speaking with the\r\n  police and was doing so by his own free will.Â  Dye also signed the portion of the\r\n  waiver form that noted Dye could read and write, had a seventh grade education,\r\n  and agreed to talk with Officer Cantrell &quot;in reference to [Daughter].&quot;Â \r\n  She testified Dye never requested clarification as to the meaning of his\r\n  rights, and based on her experience, he understood what was taking place.Â  She\r\n  recalled that Dye was calm and cooperative during this time.Â  Â \r\nOfficer\r\n  Cantrell began the interview by talking with Dye about his family and his two\r\n  daughters.Â  Dye initially denied having molested Daughter and claimed his\r\n  ex-wife was lying about the incidents to harass him.Â  In response, Officer\r\n  Cantrell informed Dye that Daughter had told some of her friends at school and that\r\n  one of the friends told his ex-wife, who then reported it to the police.Â  Dye\r\n  told Officer Cantrell he could not have molested Daughter because he had never\r\n  spent more than five minutes alone with Daughter, but he then contradicted\r\n  himself by saying the two of them took fishing trips together.Â  Officer\r\n  Cantrell pointed out this inconsistency and told Dye there were two types of\r\n  people who molest children: one type that does it on a frequent basis to\r\n  numerous victims and a second type that usually does it to one person; but\r\n  either way, these people could get help to keep them from continuing to hurt\r\n  children.Â  Officer Cantrell testified that Dye then said, &quot;I'm not saying\r\n  that I did it, but if I did, what would happen to me?&quot;Â  In response,\r\n  Officer Cantrell told him that he would be arrested, taken to jail, released if\r\n  he could post bond, and tried at a later date.Â  Officer Cantrell advised Dye\r\n  that once he was released, he could seek help if that is what he felt he needed.\r\nAt\r\n  this point, Dye confessed to having molested Daughter.Â  Officer Cantrell stated\r\n  that Dye allowed her to type his confession while he recounted the episodes of\r\n  abuse to her because he was upset and emotional.Â  When Officer Cantrell asked\r\n  if there was a reason why he performed all the acts on Daughter but never had\r\n  her perform an act on him, he started sobbing and shaking and said that his\r\n  older brother had raped him when he was younger.Â  Officer Cantrell then\r\n  questioned Dye on whether any abuse occurred with his younger daughter from his\r\n  current marriage, and Dye said that he had never done anything to her.Â  \r\nThroughout\r\n  the hour-and-a-half questioning, Officer Cantrell stated she never promised Dye\r\n  anything, never raised her voice at him, and never threatened Dye in any way.Â \r\n  She also stated only Dye and she were in the interview room during that time.Â \r\n  Officer Cantrell denied threatening to remove his younger daughter from his\r\n  home if Dye did not give her a statement but agreed that his younger daughter\r\n  was mentioned in reference to his family situation during the interview.Â  \r\nThe circuit court found there was no evidence Officer\r\n  Cantrell threatened to remove Dye's younger daughter if he refused to confess\r\n  to molesting Daughter.Â  The court ruled that the statement was voluntary on the\r\n  basis that his confession was given after he was advised of his rights and\r\n  after Dye stated he understood and wanted to waive those rights.Â  Dye's\r\n  statements were later admitted into evidence at trial over his objection.Â  A\r\n  Spartanburg County jury found Dye guilty of second-degree criminal sexual\r\n  conduct with a minor, and the circuit court sentenced Dye to the maximum\r\n  penalty of twenty years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court will review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n  v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  This Court is\r\n  bound by the circuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111\r\n  (2000).Â  On review, the circuit court's conclusions on issues of fact as to the\r\n  voluntariness of a confession will not be disturbed unless so manifestly\r\n  erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Rochester, 301\r\n  S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990).Â  This Court does not reevaluate the\r\n  facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the circuit court's ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDye contends that the circuit court erred in admitting his\r\n  confession into evidence because it was not freely and voluntarily given.Â \r\n  Specifically, Dye argues that the circuit court failed to consider the totality\r\n  of circumstances in its voluntariness determination because the court\r\n  articulated no specific findings regarding Dye's education, experience,\r\n  background, or conduct.Â  Additionally, Dye contends that his confession was not\r\n  freely and voluntarily given because it was the product of police coercion. Â We\r\n  disagree.\r\nTo determine the voluntariness of a statement, the circuit court\r\n  must first conduct an evidentiary hearing, outside the presence of the jury,\r\n  where the State must show the statement was voluntarily made by a preponderance\r\n  of the evidence. Â State v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 379, 652 S.E.2d 444,\r\n  448 (Ct. App. 2007). Â Â During this hearing, the circuit court must examine the\r\n  totality of circumstances surrounding the statement and determine whether the\r\n  State has carried its burden of proving the statement was given voluntarily.Â  Id. at 383, 652 S.E.2d at 450.Â  Our courts have recognized that the appropriate\r\n  factors to consider in the totality of circumstances analysis include:\r\n  background, experience, conduct of the accused, age, length of custody, police\r\n  misrepresentations, isolation of a minor from his or her parent, threats of\r\n  violence, and promises of leniency.Â  State v. Parker, 381 S.C. 68, 87,\r\n  671 S.E.2d 619, 628-29 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  If the circuit court finds that the\r\n  statement was given voluntarily, it is then submitted to the jury, where its\r\n  voluntariness must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v.\r\n    Washington, 296 S.C. 54, 56, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988). Â On appeal, the\r\n  circuit court's decision as to the voluntariness of the statement will not be\r\n  reversed unless so erroneous as to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.Â  Miller,\r\n  375 S.C. at 378, 652 S.E.2d at 448.Â  \r\nÂ The circuit court considered the totality of circumstances in its\r\n  voluntariness determination.Â  While the court may not have specifically\r\n  articulated all relevant factors, the court did find that Dye's statement to\r\n  the police was knowingly, intelligibly, and voluntarily made.Â  See id. at 382, 652 S.E.2d at 450 (&quot;The trial judge must determine if under the\r\n  totality of the circumstances a statement was knowingly, intelligibly, and\r\n  voluntarily made.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, a review of the record demonstrates\r\n  that the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Dye's confession\r\n  was freely and willingly made.Â  \r\nAt Officer Cantrell's request, Dye voluntarily came to the police\r\n  station.Â  Prior to speaking about any allegations of misconduct, Officer\r\n  Cantrell read Dye his rights, and Dye acknowledged that he understood them when\r\n  he initialed his name on the line next to each right.[3]Â  Officer Cantrell testified that she\r\n  never promised Dye anything in return for making a confession and denied ever\r\n  threatening or raising her voice at him.Â  Furthermore, Officer Cantrell's\r\n  statement to Dye that he could get help for his problems if he admitted to the\r\n  charge was not tantamount to coercion.Â  See State v. Von Dohlen,\r\n  322 S.C. 234, 245, 471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996) (finding fact that interrogating\r\n  officer knew and was empathetic to defendant was insufficient to render\r\n  statement involuntary) (citing to Miller v. Fenton, 796 F.2d 598, 607-11\r\n  (3rd Cir.), which upheld the admissibility of a defendant's statement\r\n  notwithstanding police's friendly approach, lies\r\n  concerning evidence, and promises to help the defendant get psychiatric care); see\r\n    also State v. Linnen, 278 S.C. 175, 179, 293 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1982)\r\n  (holding that even though interrogating officers encouraged defendant to make a\r\n  statement, their actions were not coercive or threatening).\r\nThe circuit court noted that no testimony was presented to show\r\n  that Officer Cantrell specifically threatened to remove his younger daughter if\r\n  Dye did not give a confession, and Officer Cantrell adamantly denied even\r\n  alluding to placing Dye's younger daughter in emergency protective custody if\r\n  he failed to make a statement.Â  Cf. State v. Corns, 310 S.C. 546,\r\n  549, 426 S.E.2d 324, 325 (Ct. App. 1992) (finding defendant's confession\r\n  involuntary when interrogating officer admitted that he told defendant that\r\n  defendant's wife could be arrested and that D.S.S. could take his children if\r\n  he did not confess).Â  Because no competing testimony was introduced to\r\n  contradict Officer Cantrell's statements, the circuit court was free to accept\r\n  Officer Cantrell's version of events in making its voluntariness\r\n  determination.Â  See Miller, 375 S.C. at 387, 652 S.E.2d at 453 (finding\r\n  that in a Jackson v. Denno hearing, the circuit court has the\r\n  opportunity to listen to the testimony, assess the demeanor and credibility of\r\n  all witnesses, and weigh the evidence accordingly).\r\nMoreover, the conditions surrounding Dye's confession do not\r\n  indicate his statements were induced by an oppressive environment.Â  Dye was\r\n  present at the police station for approximately an hour and a half before\r\n  signing his confession, which is not excessive under the circumstances.Â  Cf. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 245, 471 S.E.2d at 696 (finding three-hour\r\n  interrogation did not render statement involuntary based on totality of\r\n  circumstances surrounding defendant's confession).Â  Officer Cantrell stated\r\n  Dye's general demeanor was calm and cooperative, except in the instances when\r\n  he became emotional as he recounted details of prior abuse. Â In addition, when\r\n  Dye confessed, he was not in a police-dominated atmosphere as only Officer\r\n  Cantrell was present in the room.Â  See State v. Kirton, 381 S.C.\r\n  7, 39, 671 S.E.2d 107, 123 (Ct.

Eversole, of Beaufort and Stephen L. Brown, William L.\r\n  Howard, and Russell G. Hines, all of Charleston, for Appellants. \r\n\t\t\t\tColden Battey and Louis O. Dore, both of Beaufort and Robert V.\r\n  Mathison, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this\r\n  civil case, we must determine whether the trial court erred in concluding Donald and Jane Hanna (collectively the\r\n  Hannas) did not own certain property\r\n  located in Beaufort County by adverse possession and whether Eliza Frazier and\r\n  Dorothy Anderson Brailford have a right to an easement in certain property\r\n  located in the same county.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe case involves around a parcel of land located in Beaufort\r\n  County on Corn Island.[1]Â \r\n  Specifically, the property at issue lies within Section 29, Township One, Range\r\n  One East.Â  The individual lots within Section 29 are numbered sequentially.Â \r\n  The numbering begins in the upper right corner as Lot 1 and continues, reading\r\n  right to left until Lot 8 is reached in the upper left corner of the grid.Â  The\r\n  next row of lots is to the south starting with Lot 9 immediately below Lot 8 on\r\n  the left side of the grid and continuing left to right until Lot 16 is reached\r\n  on the right side of the grid immediately below Lot 1.Â  The particular parcel\r\n  of land in question in this case is Lot 9.Â  \r\nEve Green, whose descendants are Frazier and Brailford, purchased\r\n  eight acres of land on Corn Island from George Holmes in 1881. Â By 1889, Green\r\n  had increased her holdings on Corn Island from eight acres to twenty-two\r\n  acres.Â  In 1954, Beaufort County began to keep tax records by district, map,\r\n  and parcel numbers.Â  In this same year, the property record card for Green's\r\n  twenty-two acre parcel was designated as Parcel 1 on Map 12 in the name of &quot;Heirs\r\n  of Eve Green&quot; (the Heirs).Â  Parcel 1 on Map 12 included Lots 9, 23, 24,\r\n  and 26 in Section 29.Â  Lot 24 is directly below Lot 9, while Lot 23 abuts Lot\r\n  24 on the east, and Lot 26 is immediately to the south of Lot 23.Â  Green or her\r\n  heirs paid taxes on the twenty-two-acres until 1997.Â  In June 1997, the Heirs\r\n  sold Lot 26 and a small portion of Lot 23 to Broadus Thompson and his wife,\r\n  Patricia Thompson (collectively the Thompsons).Â  \r\nAt trial, the Hannas argued they had been in open, notorious,\r\n  hostile, continuous, and exclusive possession of Lot 9 for a period in excess\r\n  of ten years and asked the trial court to award title to the property by reason\r\n  of adverse possession under color of title.Â  Frazier and Brailford argued they\r\n  were entitled to an easement over Cassena Road and Cassena Island Drive, which\r\n  had been constructed by the Hannas and crossed the Hannas' property. Matthew\r\n  McAlhaney sought to intervene because he had a contract to purchase Lot 9,\r\n  among other property, from Frazier and Brailford. \r\nThe trial court allowed McAlhaney to intervene.Â  The trial court\r\n  concluded the Hannas did not own Lot 9 by adverse possession.Â  The trial court\r\n  also found Frazier and Brailford were entitled to an easement by prescription\r\n  over Cassena Road and Cassena Island Drive.Â  The trial court also denied the\r\n  Hannas' post-trial motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Adverse PossessionÂ Â  \r\nInitially, the Hannas argue the trial court erred in holding they\r\n  did not own Lot 9 by virtue of adverse possession under color of title.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  an action to quiet title usually rests in equity, an action to determine title\r\n  to real property is an action at law.Â  Eldridge v. City of Greenwood,\r\n  331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Likewise, an adverse\r\n  possession claim is an action at law.Â  Miller v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56,\r\n  61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1992).Â  In an action at law tried by a judge without a\r\n  jury, the appellate court will correct any error of law, but it must affirm the\r\n  trial court's factual findings unless no evidence reasonably supports those\r\n  findings.Â  Eldridge, 331 S.C. at 416, 503 S.E.2d at 200; see Knight\r\n    v. Hilton, 224 S.C. 452, 456, 79 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1954) (holding whether\r\n  deceased spouse of claimant had held title to land involved by adverse\r\n  possession was a legal issue and conclusion of the trial court was binding upon\r\n  an appellate court if any evidence reasonably tended to sustain it).\r\nIn\r\n  order to acquire title by adverse possession, the claimant must show the\r\n  possession to &quot;be actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous and\r\n  exclusive for the whole statutory period. It may be stated as a general rule\r\n  that claimant's possession must be such as to indicate his exclusive ownership\r\n  of the property.&quot;Â  Gregg v. Moore, 226 S.C. 366, 370, 85 S.E.2d\r\n  279, 281 (1954).Â  Color of title, as employed in this case, is relevant to\r\n  adverse possession in that color of title may be used to show possession of an\r\n  entire tract of property even though the claimant adversely possesses only a\r\n  small portion of the entire tract.Â  Johnson v. Pritchard, 302 S.C. 437,\r\n  446, 305 S.E.2d 191, 196 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has\r\n  described color of title as follows:\r\n\r\n\tColor of title means any semblance of title by which\r\n  the extent of a man's possession can be ascertained.Â  It is anything which\r\n  shows the extent of occupant's claim.Â  The object of color of title is not to\r\n  pass title.Â  In that case it would be title, not color of title.Â  The only\r\n  office of color of title is to define the extent of the claim and to extend the\r\n  possession beyond the actual occupancy to the whole property described in the\r\n  paper.Â  Hence, when one enters upon land, under color\r\n  of title, his actual possession of a portion of the property will be\r\n  constructively extended to the boundaries defined by his color of title.\r\n\r\nMullins v. Winchester, 237 S.C. 487, 492, 118 S.E.2d 61, 63 (1961)\r\n  (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  Hannas pursued their claim of adverse possession under color of title.Â  To\r\n  support that theory, the Hannas argued that in 1951 a deed from Joseph Holmes\r\n  to H.B. Attaway, Sr.,[2] J.M. Attaway, and H.B. Attaway conveyed forty-seven acres of property.Â  According\r\n  to the Hannas, this conveyance included a twenty-acre parcel that they believe\r\n  contained Lot 9.Â  A careful review of the record reveals the Hannas' belief the\r\n  1951 deed included Lot 9 is misplaced.\r\nThe\r\n  1951 deed for the forty-seven acres consisted of twenty-seven acres from the estate\r\n  of Caesar Holmes and twenty acres from the estate of Sam Holmes.Â  These two\r\n  parcels were in turn comprised of Lots 17, 18, 19, 20, and 32.Â  Nowhere is Lot\r\n  9 included in the 1951 deed. There was no color of title conferring any\r\n  ownership interest in Lot 9 to the Hannas.Â  The Hannas' claim of occupying Lot\r\n  9 under color of title is without evidentiary support.Â  As such, in order to\r\n  prevail under a theory of adverse possession the Hannas must show their\r\n  possession of Lot 9 to &quot;be actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous\r\n  and exclusive for the whole statutory period.&quot;Â  See Gregg,\r\n  226 S.C. at 370, 85 S.E.2d at 281.\r\nIf a claimant asserts title by adverse possession and\r\n  his or her occupancy is not under color of title, the claimant must show either\r\n  fencing or other improvements covering most of the subject land or some other\r\n  continuous use and exercise of dominion.Â  King v. Hawkins, 282 S.C. 508,\r\n  511, 319 S.E.2d 361, 362 (1984).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the record reveals the Hannas\r\n  never fenced the property, made improvements to it, or exercised dominion over\r\n  it.Â  Peter Brown, who stated he was intimately aware of the property on Corn\r\n  Island, testified that Lot 9 had never been farmed or fenced.Â  Louise Calvary,\r\n  who testified she was an heir of Green, stated she came to Beaufort County to\r\n  pay taxes on the property between 1996 and 2004.Â  Calvary testified that during\r\n  these visits she would inspect the property, and when asked whether it was\r\n  fenced, she replied it was not.Â  Additionally, Calvary testified that Don Hanna\r\n  was timbering the property but when asked to stop, he complied.Â  Although this\r\n  testimony may seem self-serving, Jane Hanna's testimony confirmed Calvary's\r\n  account.Â  \r\nJane Hanna was asked, &quot;The only purpose that you\r\n  ever used Lot 9 was for recreational?&quot;Â  She replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;Â \r\n  Jane Hanna was also asked, &quot;You have never fenced [Lot 9]?,&quot; to which\r\n  she replied, &quot;Never fenced it.&quot;Â  Based on the foregoing, evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the trial court's findings.Â  See Knight, 224\r\n  S.C. at 456, 79 S.E.2d at 873 (holding whether deceased spouse of claimant held\r\n  title to land involved by adverse possession was a legal issue and conclusion\r\n  of trial court was binding upon an appellate court if any evidence reasonably\r\n  tended to sustain it).\r\nII. Easement \r\nThe\r\n  Hannas next argue the trial court improperly concluded Frazier and Brailford were entitled to an\r\n  easement by prescription over Cassena Road and Cassena Island Drive.Â  We agree. \r\n&quot;The determination of the existence of an easement\r\n  is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an any evidence standard\r\n  of review when tried by a judge without a jury.&quot;Â  Tupper v. Dorchester\r\n    County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  &quot;However, the\r\n  determination of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in\r\n  equity.&quot;Â  Id.Â  As such, this court may take its own view of the\r\n  evidence on the latter issue.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe only public\r\n  road leading to Corn Island is Coosaw River Drive.Â  Prior to 1994, the only\r\n  means of accessing property on Corn Island from Coosaw River Drive was by a\r\n  road (Old Road) that crossed the properties of the Hannas, Colden Battey,[3] and the Heirs.Â  The Old Road ran along the southern boundary of the Hannas' and\r\n  Battey's property and crossed onto the property of the Heirs. Â The location\r\n  where the Old Road crossed the Heirs' property was sold to the Thompsons.Â \r\n  Based on these facts, the trial court concluded the Heirs possessed a\r\n  prescriptive easement over the Old Road.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition to finding this easement, the trial court relocated the easement to a\r\n  new road constructed by the Hannas.Â  In 1994, Don Hanna cleared a new road that\r\n  crossed the Hannas' and Battey's property.Â  This new road is called Cassena\r\n  Road from the point it intersects the public road, Coosaw River Drive.Â  Cassena\r\n  Road splits at a point north of the boundary between the Hannas property and\r\n  property owned by the Thompsons.Â  The section of Cassena Road that goes north\r\n  onto the Hannas property is called Cassena Island Drive, while the section that\r\n  heads south onto the Thompsons property is called Cassena Road.Â  After Cassena\r\n  Road was built, the Old Road fell into disuse and became obstructed by debris\r\n  and trash.Â  As a result, the Thompsons, Battey, and the Hannas employed Cassena\r\n  Road and Cassena Island Drive to access their property.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  establish a private right of way by prescription, one must show &quot;(1) the\r\n  continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of the right for the full period\r\n  of twenty years, (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed, and (3) the use or\r\n  enjoyment was adverse or under claim of right.&quot;Â  Hartley v. John Wesley\r\n    United Methodist Church of Johns Island, 355 S.C. 145, 150, 584 S.E.2d 386,\r\n  388 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWith\r\n  respect to the first element, no evidence showed the Heirs used the Old Road\r\n  for the required twenty years.Â  Battey testified he did not specifically know\r\n  if the Heirs had ever used the Old Road.Â  Jane Hanna testified that she never\r\n  saw the Heirs use the Old Road.Â  Additionally, the trial court could not point\r\n  to any specific occurrences in which the Heirs ever used the Old Road.Â  The\r\n  trial court's conclusion that the Heirs owned an easement by prescription over the Old Road was error\r\n  because no evidence in the record showed\r\n  the Heirs ever, much less for twenty years, employed the Old Road to access\r\n  their property.Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  trial court also stated, &quot;[T]he Hannahs [sic] are estopped to deny that\r\n  the easement of Frazier and Brailford moved when Donald G. Hannah [sic]\r\n  relocated the road.Â  The 'old road' had been in place and had been used by all\r\n  owners on Corn Island for a period sufficient to establish the easement by\r\n  prescription, at the time Donald G. Hannah [sic] made his decision to move the\r\n  road . . . .&quot;Â  Even if we assume, without deciding, the trial court\r\n  properly employed estoppel in this case, the necessary elements of estoppel are\r\n  not met.\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  essential elements of estoppel as related to the party estopped are: (1)\r\n  conduct which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material\r\n  facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the\r\n  facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party\r\n  subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intention, or at least expectation, that\r\n  such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; [and] (3) knowledge,\r\n  actual or constructive, of the real facts.Â  As related to the party claiming\r\n  the estoppel, the essential elements are: (1) lack of knowledge and of the\r\n  means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question, (2) reliance upon\r\n  the conduct of the party estopped, and (3) prejudicial change in position. \r\n\r\nS. Dev. Land &amp; Golf\r\n  Co. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth., 311\r\n  S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1993) (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe first element\r\n  requires the Hannas' conduct to amount to a false representation or concealment\r\n  of material facts or at least, which is calculated to convey the impression the\r\n  facts are otherwise than and inconsistent with those that the Hannas subsequently\r\n  attempted to assert.Â  This element was not met because the Hannas did not make\r\n  any representations, nor did their conduct amount to a false representation or\r\n  concealment of facts, with respect to the Heirs using the Old Road.Â  Jane Hanna\r\n  testified she never saw the Heirs use the Old Road.Â  Additionally, the trial\r\n  court could not point to any specific occurrences in which the Heirs had ever\r\n  used the Old Road.Â  As the Heirs presented no direct evidence they ever\r\n  employed the Old Road, the Hannas could not have made any representations to\r\n  the Heirs.Â  As such, the trial court committed reversible error in concluding Frazier and Brailford were\r\n  entitled to an easement by prescription over Cassena Road and Cassena Island\r\n  Drive.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.Â Â  \r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Corn Island is also known as James Island. \r\n[2] H.B.

Â In January 2003, Dr. Reid noted Fishburne exhibited four out\r\n  of five Waddell's non-organic physical signs[2] and had non-organic pain behaviors which affected her gait.Â  He also restated\r\n  her subjective complaints of pain far outweighed his objective findings, and he\r\n  did not see any necessity in continuing narcotic medication given his\r\n  findings.Â  Again, he discharged her at MMI and gave her an impairment rating of\r\n  five percent for the whole person and entire spine.\r\nIn July\r\n  of 2002, Fishburne underwent a functional capacity evaluation, which found she\r\n  was able to frequently sit, stand, walk, grasp, stack, static trunk bend,\r\n  kneel, crouch, stoop, repetitively squat, and push and pull a weighted cart;\r\n  occasionally lift a maximum of thirty-six-and-a-half pounds from floor to\r\n  knuckle level; lift thirty-one-and-a-half pounds from knuckle to shoulder; frequently\r\n  lift twenty-four-and-a-half pounds from floor to knuckle level and from knuckle\r\n  to shoulder level; and frequently carry twenty-four-and-a-half pounds for\r\n  one-hundred feet.Â  Based on the findings, the evaluator determined Fishburne was\r\n  lifting in the medium category of work based on the United States Department of\r\n  Labor (USDL) Standards and met the physical demands to perform medium work for\r\n  an eight-hour day based on the USDL Standards; however, she did not meet the\r\n  physical demands required to lift a maximum of fifty pounds as required by her job\r\n  at ATI.Â  The evaluator also noted Fishburne exhibited some Waddell signs,\r\n  indicating she had moderate magnified illness behavior, and although she did\r\n  not take pain medicine before the test, no spikes in Fishburne's heart rate\r\n  were noted with the increased reports of pain.\r\nDr. Philip C. Latourette, a\r\n  pain management specialist at\r\n  the Carolina Center for Advanced Management of Pain, saw Fishburne in June of\r\n  2003.Â  He noted her electromyogram (EMG), MRI, computerized tomography (CT)\r\n  myelogram, and nerve conduction velocity tests were all negative.Â  He also\r\n  noted that Fishburne did not find physical therapy, epidural shots, and\r\n  discography to be helpful.Â  Dr. Latourette ordered a sacroiliac joint injection and right side facet joint\r\n  injection; however, they also\r\n  did not provide Fishburne with relief.Â  A selective nerve root injection gave\r\n  her some short-term relief.Â  Dr. Latourette referred Fishburne to Dr. C. David\r\n  Tollison for further treatment.Â  Dr. Tollison, a psychologist at the Carolina\r\n  Center for Advanced Management of Pain, first saw Fishburne in February of\r\n  2004.Â  She complained of lower back and right leg pain from her work injury.Â \r\n  He diagnosed her with an adjustment disorder with mixed depressive and anxiety\r\n  features and somatoform pain disorder with psychological factors.[3]Â  At his deposition, Dr. Tollison\r\n  stated he had just seen Fishburne the day before, and she told him the &quot;pain\r\n  was not all the way down her leg and in her foot like it was when she was first\r\n  injured.&quot;Â  Fishburne also told Dr. Tollison she was exercising, spending\r\n  time with her family, fishing, maintaining a positive attitude overall, and\r\n  learning to do other things.Â  Dr. Tollison prescribed Wellbutrin and Zoloft for\r\n  Fishburne's depression and said he believed she would need treatment five or six\r\n  times a year because of her medications and continued therapy.Â  He also stated\r\n  he believed she had reached a level of psychological MMI.Â  However, in October\r\n  of 2005, Dr. Tollison signed a statement that Fishburne was permanently and\r\n  totally disabled as a result of the combination of her physical and\r\n  psychological problems related to her work injury.\r\nIn February of 2004, Fishburne saw Dr. William B. Evins, an\r\n  orthopedic surgeon at Oakwood Orthopaedic, for an independent medical evaluation.Â  Dr. Evins found no\r\n  indication of any disc disease that would cause all of her symptoms and she was\r\n  at MMI with an impairment rating of fifteen to twenty percent of the lumbar\r\n  spine.Â  In January of 2006, Fishburne was given two independent medical\r\n  evaluations and one vocational evaluation.Â  Dr. George R. Bruce, an orthopedic surgeon at Oconee Orthopaedic Clinic, found in his independent\r\n  medical examination that Fishburne had a physical impairment of twenty-four\r\n  percent for the whole person and twenty-seven percent of the lumbar spine.Â  He\r\n  also noted she would not benefit from any surgery and had reached MMI.Â  Dr.\r\n  Charles B. Thomas, of Palmetto Disability Evaluations, found in his independent\r\n  medical examination that Fishburne demonstrated four of Waddell's five signs,\r\n  suggesting a non-organic source for her pain, and noted she grimaced and sighed\r\n  with all movement.Â  Dr. Thomas also noted the degenerative changes shown on Fishburne's\r\n  MRI predated her work injury, and he believed she could return to her previous\r\n  level of work if she were off narcotics.Â  In his vocational evaluation of\r\n  Fishburne, Randy L. Adams, M.Ed., determined she was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled from any work.\r\nAt the hearing before the Single Commissioner, Fishburne was the\r\n  sole witness to testify on her behalf.Â  Fishburne testified she suffered from\r\n  pain in her low back, right side, right heel, right leg, and right foot.Â  As a\r\n  result, she claimed it was hard for her to get out of bed in the morning, and she\r\n  came to the hearing using her mother's cane that no doctor had prescribed for\r\n  her.Â  Fishburne testified she was not able to sit or stand for long periods of\r\n  time, wash a sink of dishes, or remove wet clothes from the washer.Â  Fishburne also\r\n  asserted she cried for no reason because she could no longer do things she used\r\n  to be able to do, and the pain medicine eased her pain, but the pain never went\r\n  away completely.Â  In July of 2004, Fishburne was involved in a car accident,\r\n  but maintained she only injured her neck.Â  Fishburne testified she sought a\r\n  lump sum payment for total disability to buy a house, and she had not worked\r\n  since she was let go from ATI, but she had not applied for any jobs since that\r\n  time.\r\nThe Single Commissioner found Fishburne sustained a ten percent\r\n  permanent partial disability to her back including any right lower extremity\r\n  radiculopathy.Â  The Commissioner determined the greater weight of the evidence\r\n  did not support a finding that Fishburne was permanently and totally disabled\r\n  under South Carolina Code sections 42-9-10 or 42-9-30(19).Â  In February of\r\n  2007, the Commission's Appellate Panel affirmed the Single Commissioner, and in\r\n  July of 2007, the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â Â Â  \r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for\r\n  judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel.&nbsp; Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\n    Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).&nbsp; Under the scope of review established\r\n  in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\n  Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\n  reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.&nbsp; Stone v.\r\n    Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a\r\n  workers' compensation decision.&nbsp; Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357\r\n  S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp; The Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the\r\n  record.&nbsp; Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d\r\n  569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005).&nbsp; However, an appellate court can reverse or\r\n  modify the Appellate Panel's decision if the appellant's substantial rights\r\n  have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is &quot;clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); Bursey v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d\r\n  80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\n\r\n\t&quot;Substantial evidence&quot; is not a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is\r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have\r\n  reached in order to justify its action.\r\n\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306\r\n  (citation omitted).\r\n&quot;[T]he\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,\r\n  282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984).&nbsp; In workers' compensation\r\n  cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact.&nbsp; Shealy v.\r\n    Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).&nbsp; When the evidence is conflicting over a factual\r\n  issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive.&nbsp; Hargrove\r\n    v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).&nbsp; The final determination of witness credibility\r\n  and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved for the Appellate\r\n  Panel.&nbsp; Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 458, 622 S.E.2d\r\n  577, 581 (Ct. App. 2005).[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Permanent Total DisabilityÂ  \r\nFishburne\r\n  argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she sustained only a ten percent\r\n  loss of use of her back because she asserts she was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled from the combination of her injuries.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe extent of an injured workman's disability is a question of\r\n  fact for determination by the Appellate Panel and will not be reversed if it is\r\n  supported by competent evidence.Â  Colvin\r\n    v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours Co., 227\r\n  S.C. 465, 468, 88 S.E.2d 581, 582 (1955).Â  &quot;While an impairment rating may\r\n  not rest on 'surmise, speculation or conjecture . . . it is not necessary that\r\n  the percentage of disability or loss of use be shown with mathematical\r\n  exactness.'&quot;Â  Sanders v. MeadWestvaco Corp., 371 S.C. 284, 291, 638\r\n  S.E.2d 66, 70 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Roper v. Kimbrell's of Greenville,\r\n  231 S.C. 453, 461, 99 S.E.2d 52, 57 (1957)).Â  &quot;The Appellate Panel is not\r\n  bound by the opinion of medical experts and 'may find a degree of disability\r\n  different from that suggested by expert testimony.'&quot; Id. at 292,\r\n  638 S.E.2d at 70 (quoting Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co., 315 S.C. 440, 445,\r\n  434 S.E.2d 292, 295 (Ct. App. 1993)). Â &quot;Expert medical testimony is\r\n  designed to aid the Commission in coming to the correct conclusion; therefore,\r\n  the Commission determines the weight and credit to be given to the expert\r\n  testimony.&quot;Â  Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C.\r\n  333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999).Â  The Commission is also given discretion\r\n  to weigh and consider all the evidence, including both lay and expert\r\n  testimony.Â  Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 847. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFishburne asserts substantial evidence exists to prove she was\r\n  entitled to permanent total disability because she sustained complete loss of\r\n  earning capacity from the injuries to her back and the related effect in her\r\n  right leg and psyche.Â  The substantial evidence, however, supports the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision.Â  Dr. Reid, Fishburne's treating physician,\r\n  determined she could return to medium work capacity in July of 2002.Â  Also, in July, a functional capacity evaluation\r\n  determined Fishburne met the physical demands to perform medium work for an eight-hour\r\n  day based on the United States Department of Labor Standards.Â  In January of\r\n  2006, Dr. Thomas stated he thought Fishburne could return to her previous level\r\n  of work if she were off narcotics.Â  In contrast, Dr. Tollison signed a statement that Fishburne was\r\n  permanently and totally disabled as a result of the combination of her physical\r\n  and psychological problems related to her work injury.Â  The Single\r\n  Commissioner, however, stated she gave less weight to Dr. Tollison's opinion\r\n  &quot;because of the objective evidence and [her] own observations and\r\n  impression at the hearing.&quot;Â  Also, the\r\n  vocational evaluator, Adams, determined Fishburne was permanently and totally\r\n  disabled from any work, but he\r\n  cited only the opinions of Dr. Bruce and Dr. Tollison in reaching his conclusion,\r\n  causing the Single Commissioner to give his opinion little weight.Â  Furthermore, Fishburne testified she had not even\r\n  applied for any jobs since her injury; thus, she did not make any reasonable\r\n  efforts to secure employment and was unable to do so because of her\r\n  work-related injury.\r\nThe objective medical evidence also does not support Fishburne's\r\n  claim that she suffers from a serious medical condition that entitles her to\r\n  permanent total disability.Â  Fishburne underwent many tests and none revealed\r\n  any serious problems:Â  her\r\n  EMG and nerve conduction velocity tests were\r\n  negative; her CT myelogram and neurological exam were\r\n  benign; her discography was\r\n  non-diagnostic; and her MRIs showed only mild disc degenerative disease.Â  None of Fishburne's physicians recommended\r\n  she have any surgery.Â  Furthermore, at least three different health care\r\n  providers noted Fishburne exhibited either symptom magnification or Waddell\r\n  signs, indicating there was a non-organic\r\n  or psychological component to Fishburne's back pain.Â  Dr. Tollison also diagnosed Fishburne\r\n  with somatoform pain disorder, a condition where physical symptoms are caused\r\n  by psychological factors, rather than an identifiable physical cause.Â  The Single Commissioner also determined Fishburne's\r\n  psychological condition was not disabling because Dr. Tollison's reports stated\r\n  her mood was stable and the drugs were controlling her depression.Â  The reports\r\n  also stated her crying spells and irritability had ceased; she was walking for\r\n  exercise; visiting with grandchildren; attending birthday parties; and seeing\r\n  friends socially.\r\nFishburne\r\n  also argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she sustained only a ten\r\n  percent loss of use of her back.Â \r\n  However, this finding was within the evidence presented to the Single Commissioner.Â \r\n  Dr. Reid gave Fishburne an impairment rating of five percent for the whole person\r\n  and entire spine; Dr. Evins gave\r\n  Fishburne an impairment rating of fifteen to twenty percent of the lumbar\r\n  spine; and Dr. Bruce gave Fishburne a physical impairment of twenty-four\r\n  percent for the whole person and twenty-seven percent of the lumbar spine. Â Therefore, the Appellate Panel's decision\r\n  awarding Fishburne a permanent partial disability benefit of ten percent loss\r\n  for her back, including her right lower extremity, was within the medical\r\n  evidence and testimony presented to the Commission.\r\nII.&nbsp; Right LegÂ  \r\nFishburne\r\n  argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she was not entitled to an award of\r\n  permanent partial disability to her right leg.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFishburne\r\n  claims her back injury negatively affected her right leg and she was limited in\r\n  her ability to sit or stand for an extended period of time; thus, she asserts\r\n  she is entitled to a separate award for the loss of the use of her right leg.Â \r\n  The Single Commissioner's order specifically stated the ten percent permanent\r\n  partial disability award for Fishburne's back injury encompassed any right\r\n  lower extremity radiculopathy.Â  Also, Fishburne presented no evidence that she\r\n  had sustained a specific injury to her right lower extremity, and Dr. Evins noted he did not see indication\r\n  of any disc disease that would cause all of her symptoms.Â  Furthermore, at his\r\n  deposition, Dr. Tollison stated he had just seen Fishburne the day before and\r\n  she told him the pain was not all the way down her leg and in her foot like it\r\n  had been.Â  Thus, the Appellate Panel's decision, finding Fishburne was not\r\n  entitled to a separate award for permanent partial disability benefits for her\r\n  right lower extremity, was supported by the evidence presented to the\r\n  Commission. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Medical TreatmentÂ  \r\nFishburne\r\n  argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she was only entitled to additional\r\n  medical treatment to wean her from unnecessary narcotics.Â  We disagree. \r\nDr.\r\n  Reid noted in his records that Fishburne exhibited four out of the five\r\n  Waddell's non-organic physical signs and had non-organic pain behaviors that\r\n  affected her gait; her subjective complaints of pain far outweighed the\r\n  objective findings; and he did not see any necessity for Fishburne to continue\r\n  taking narcotic medication.Â  Dr. Thomas wrote that Fishburne could return to\r\n  her previous level of work if she were off narcotics.Â  Dr. Thomas also noted\r\n  Fishburne grimaced and sighed with all movement; determined she demonstrated four\r\n  out of the five Waddell's signs; and the degenerative changes noted on her MRI\r\n  predated her work injury.Â  Additionally, Dr. Evins noted he did not see\r\n  indication of any disc disease that would cause all of Fishburne's symptoms.Â \r\n  Dr. Tollison and Dr. Bruce stated they believed Fishburne needed to be\r\n  maintained on medication; however, the Single Commissioner declared she gave\r\n  little weight to the opinions of Drs. Tollison and Bruce.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  Appellate Panel's order finding Fishburne was only entitled to medical\r\n  treatment for the purpose of weaning her from unnecessary narcotic medication\r\n  is supported by sufficient evidence. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Witness Credibility\r\nFishburne\r\n  argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she did not provide credible\r\n  testimony at the hearing.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\n&quot;[T]he Commission is the sole fact-finder in workers'\r\n  compensation cases, and . . . any questions of credibility must be resolved by\r\n  the Commission.&quot;Â  Smith v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 329 S.C.\r\n  485, 501, 494 S.E.2d 630, 638 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  &quot;It is logical for the [Appellate\r\n  Panel], which did not have the benefit of observing the witnesses, to give\r\n  weight to the Hearing Commissioner's opinion.&quot;Â  Green v.\r\n    Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 250 S.C. 58, 64, 156 S.E.2d 318, 321 (1967).Â  Â Â \r\nFishburne\r\n  was the only witness to testify on her behalf.Â  The\r\n  reliability of the documents and Fishburne's statements were matters of\r\n  credibility for the Appellate Panel, which, in upholding the Single\r\n  Commissioner's order, discounted Fishburne's credibility because she\r\n  exaggerated her symptoms and made inconsistent statements at the hearing and to\r\n  her treating physicians.Â  Additionally, the Single Commissioner's order stated\r\n  Fishburne &quot;ambulated into the hearing room with a cane that no doctor\r\n  prescribed. . . . [P]resented herself as continually wiping tears [the]\r\n  Commissioner never observed, and constantly made loud sniffling sounds from a\r\n  nose that . . . never 'ran'.&quot;Â  This conduct, in addition to her\r\n  inconsistent statements, caused the Single Commissioner to question Fishburne's\r\n  credibility.Â  Therefore, substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision that Fishburne's testimony was not credible.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â From the record on appeal, it appears Fishburne was\r\n  treated at Doctor's Care from the day after her accident until she began seeing\r\n  Dr. Reid.\r\n[2]Â  Waddell's non-organic physical signs are a group of\r\n  physical signs that may indicate a non-organic or psychological component to\r\n  chronic low back pain.Â  Gordon Waddell, MD, et al., Nonorganic Physical\r\n    Signs in Low-Back Pain, Spine, March/April 1980, at 117.Â  If more than three\r\n  out of the five signs are present, there is high probability the patient has\r\n  non-organic pain.Â  Id.

Giese\r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.:Â  Appellant Christopher\r\n  Commander seeks review of his murder conviction.Â  He challenges the trial\r\n  court's admission of certain expert testimony and the trial court's failure to\r\n  charge the jury on the defense of accident.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCommander's\r\n  pregnant girlfriend, Gervonya Goodwin, was last seen alive by members of her\r\n  family on November 29, 2004.Â  On January 7, 2005, her family discovered her\r\n  body covered with a blanket and lying on a couch inside her home.Â  The body was\r\n  mummified and partially decomposed.[1]Â \r\n  Additionally, Goodwin's purse, cell phone, and car were missing.Â  Police\r\n  investigators and family members later discovered that Commander had (1) stolen\r\n  Goodwin's car, credit cards, and cell phone; (2) withdrawn money from her bank\r\n  accounts; and (3) sent text messages from her cell phone to members of her\r\n  family indicating that she was at the beach and was still alive. Â Commander admitted\r\n  to killing Goodwin when he was arrested in New Orleans, Louisiana.Â  \r\nThe State indicted Commander for murder\r\n  in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003).Â  At trial, the State's expert in forensic\r\n  pathology, Dr. Clay Nichols, testified that the cause of Goodwin's death was\r\n  asphyxiation.Â  Prior to sharing his final conclusion as to the cause of death,\r\n  counsel for the State questioned him about his preliminary conclusion upon examining\r\n  Goodwin's body at her home:\r\n\r\n\tQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Did you come â€“ after your\r\n  examination and prior to getting the toxicology reports back, did you come to a\r\n  preliminary conclusion as [sic] the cause of death in this case?\r\n\tAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, I did.\r\n\tQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  And what was that, sir?\r\n\tAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Given the fact that this woman\r\n  died under suspicious circumstances, that the history I was given was that her\r\n  â€“ she was already in her house, no one had talked to her for a period of time,\r\n  her car was missing, her purse was missing, there was some indication that\r\n  somebody was sending text messages to family members indicating that the dead\r\n  woman, Gervonya Goodwin, was still alive, this indicated an extremely\r\n  suspicious circumstance, and I felt that we were dealing with a homicide.\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n  counsel immediately objected.Â  Outside the jury's presence, defense counsel\r\n  argued that Dr. Nichols' opinion was based on matters outside the scope of his\r\n  expertise and therefore was not allowed under Rule 702, SCRE.[2]Â \r\n  The trial court questioned Dr. Nichols on his definition of\r\n  &quot;homicide,&quot; and Dr. Nichols responded as follows:\r\n\r\n\tTHE WITNESS:Â  Yes sir.Â  Homicide is\r\n  someone [sic] who died as a result of the actions of another individual.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â Â Â Â Â  As opposed to?\r\n\tTHE WITNESS:Â  An accidental cause where\r\n  somebody unintentionally caused death to another individual.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Defense counsel objected\r\n  to Dr. Nichols' use of the concept of intent in his definition of\r\n  &quot;homicide&quot; and requested that the trial court give a curative\r\n  instruction to the jury.Â  \r\nThe trial court did\r\n  not indicate whether it would give a curative instruction, but it directed\r\n  counsel for the State to question Dr. Nichols on his definition of\r\n  &quot;homicide&quot; in the jury's presence.[3]Â \r\n  Dr. Nichols provided the jury with the following definition:\r\n\r\n\tQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Doctor, what is your definition\r\n  of homicide?\r\n\tAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  A person that [sic] has died as\r\n  a result of another person's actions.\r\n\tQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  And in your opinion in this\r\n  case, was this or could this have been a natural death?Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\tAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  No, I don't believe so.\r\n\tQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Or an accidental death?\r\n\tAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  No, I do not believe so.\r\n\tQÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Or a suicide?\r\n\tAÂ Â Â Â Â Â  No, I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel cross-examined Dr.\r\n  Nichols on his earlier statement that Goodwin died under &quot;suspicious\r\n  circumstances,&quot; and Dr. Nichols explained that the autopsy process\r\n  included interpreting the history of the case.Â  During his explanation, Dr.\r\n  Nichols stated &quot;somebody went through an awful lot of effort to cover up\r\n  this death . . . .&quot;Â  After ruling out other causes of death, Dr. Nichols\r\n  concluded that the cause of Goodwin's death was homicide due to asphyxiation.Â \r\n  The conclusion was based in part on the absence of any other cause.Â  Dr. Nichols\r\n  later stated, &quot;I'm not claiming intent.Â  I'm claiming that she died as a\r\n  result of somebody else's actions.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State also presented the testimony of John Pressley, who met Commander while\r\n  they were both serving prison time at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center. Â Pressley testified that Commander approached him to obtain assistance with a petition\r\n  for a writ of habeas corpus and that they had several conversations about Commander's\r\n  pending murder charge.Â  Pressley recounted Commander asking him the following\r\n  question:\r\n\r\n\tWhat do you think if I told my attorney\r\n  to tell them that she, the victim, hit me in the head with a stick, we had an\r\n  argument and she hit me in the head with a stick and I fell unconscious and\r\n  fell on top of her, and when I regained consciousness she had died from being\r\n  suffocated?\r\n\r\nPressley\r\n  stated that he told Commander that no one was going to believe that account of\r\n  events.Â  Pressley also indicated that Commander later told him that he had an\r\n  argument with Goodwin, that she hit him with a stick and made him angry, and that\r\n  he fell on her and suffocated her.Â  Pressley further stated, &quot;I asked him\r\n  were you unconscious, and he said, no, he wasn't unconscious, he suffocated\r\n  her.&quot;Â  On cross-examination, Pressley repeated Commander's question\r\n  regarding what he should tell his attorney:\r\n\r\n\tAnd he asked me a question, what did I\r\n  think, he wanted my opinion.Â  If he had this lawyer . . . what did I think if\r\n  he told his lawyer to tell the State that his girlfriend, the victim, hit him\r\n  in the head with a stick and he fell unconscious and fell on her and when he\r\n  was â€“ when he regained consciousness that she had died from suffocation because\r\n  he was on her, he fell on top of her.Â  And I told him, no one is going to\r\n  believe this.Â  \r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of trial, defense\r\n  counsel requested the trial court to charge the jury on the defenses of\r\n  self-defense and accident, but the trial court declined to do so.Â  As to Dr.\r\n  Nichols' testimony, the trial court charged the jury that they were not to\r\n  place any expert opinions &quot;above the idea of your own opinions on the\r\n  subject, but you are to consider these opinions along with all the other\r\n  evidence in the case in forming your own conclusions.&quot;Â  The jury found Commander\r\n  guilty of murder, and the trial court sentenced Commander to life imprisonment\r\n  without the possibility of parole. Â This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in allowing Dr. Nichols to \r\n\t\t\tgive his opinion that the &quot;suspicious circumstances&quot; surrounding \r\n\t\t\tGoodwin's death indicated a homicide when that opinion was not based \r\n\t\t\ton scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that would \r\n\t\t\tassist the jury in understanding the evidence or in determining a \r\n\t\t\tdisputed fact as required by Rule 702, SCRE?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in declining to charge the \r\n\t\t\tjury on the defense of accident?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the\r\n  discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not interfere unless the\r\n  rights of the appellant were prejudiced.&nbsp; State v. Bridges, 278\r\n  S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982).&nbsp; As such, this Court reviews\r\n  errors of law only and is bound by the trial court's factual determinations\r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.&nbsp; State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41,\r\n  48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Admission\r\n  of Expert Testimony\r\nCommander asserts that the trial court\r\n  erred in admitting Dr. Nichols' opinion that the &quot;suspicious\r\n  circumstances&quot; surrounding Goodwin's death indicated a homicide because\r\n  that opinion was not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized\r\n  knowledge that would assist the jury in understanding the evidence or in\r\n  determining a disputed fact.Â  We conclude that Commander was not prejudiced by\r\n  the admission of this opinion into evidence.\r\n&quot;Error may not be predicated upon a\r\n  ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the\r\n  party is affected.&quot; Â Rule 103, SCRE.Â  In other words, to warrant reversal based on the admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the\r\n  ruling and the resulting prejudice. Â Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc.,\r\n  366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375 (2005); Fields v. Reg'l\r\n    Med. Ctr. Orangeburg,\r\n  363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005). \r\nTo establish prejudice, the appellant\r\n  must convince this Court that there is a reasonable probability that the jury's\r\n  verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at\r\n  26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  Here, Commander argues that he was prejudiced by Dr.\r\n  Nichols' opinion detailing the &quot;suspicious circumstances&quot; of\r\n  Goodwin's death because it misled the jurors into substituting his opinion for\r\n  their own judgment on matters not requiring specialized knowledge.\r\nAssuming, arguendo, that the admission\r\n  of this opinion violated Rule 702, SCRE, Commander was not prejudiced. Â Dr. Nichols later\r\n  explained to the jury that in concluding that Goodwin's death was a homicide, he\r\n  was not purporting to give an opinion on &quot;intent,&quot; but was rather\r\n  attempting to establish the manner of deathâ€”that Goodwin died as a result of\r\n  somebody else's actions. Â Further, during the course of giving standard jury\r\n  instructions, the trial court advised the jury that they were not to place any\r\n  expert opinions above the idea of their own opinions on the subject at hand,\r\n  but that they were to consider expert opinions along with all the other\r\n  evidence in the case in forming their own conclusions. Â Such an instruction is\r\n  consistent with established South Carolina law.Â  &quot;The same tests\r\n  which are commonly applied in the evaluation of ordinary evidence are to be\r\n  used in judging the weight and sufficiency of expert testimony.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499,\r\n  503, 671 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2009); [4] see also State v.\r\n    White, Op. No. 26642 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 27, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 36, 41) (holding that the trial court\r\n  properly instructed the jury that they were to give expert dog handler's\r\n  testimony such weight and credibility as they deemed appropriate as with any\r\n  and all witnesses testifying at trial). &nbsp;&quot;As with any witness,\r\n  the jury is free to accept or reject the testimony of an expert witness.&quot;Â  Douglas, 380\r\n  S.C. at 503, 671 S.E.2d at 609. Â Â \r\nIn any event, the admission of the\r\n  disputed testimony was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Commander's\r\n  guilt.Â  See State\r\n    v. Mizzell,\r\n  349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318 (2002) (holding that whether error is\r\n  harmless depends on the facts of each case, including the importance of challenged testimony in prosecution's\r\n  case, whether the testimony was cumulative, presence or absence of evidence\r\n  corroborating or contradicting testimony on material points, extent of\r\n  cross-examination otherwise permitted, and overall strength of prosecution's\r\n  case).Â  Therefore,\r\n  the admission of Dr. Nichols' testimony does not warrant reversal.Â  See Rule 103,\r\n  SCRE (stating that error\r\n  may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a\r\n  substantial right of the party is affected); State v. Mitchell,\r\n  286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151&nbsp;(1985)&nbsp;(holding that error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected\r\n  the result of the trial).Â  Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Charge on Accident\r\nCommander\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the\r\n  defense of accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nIf a killing is\r\n  unintentional and occurs &quot;while the perpetrator [is] engaged in a lawful\r\n  enterprise, and [is] not the result of negligence, the homicide will be excused\r\n  on the score of accident.&quot;Â  State v. Brown, 205 S.C. 514, 521, 32\r\n  S.E.2d 825, 828 (1945). Â \r\n&quot;The law to be charged must be\r\n  determined from the evidence presented at trial.&quot;Â  \r\nState v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 512&nbsp;(2000).Â  In\r\n  determining whether the evidence requires a charge of accident, the Court views\r\n  the facts in a light most favorable to the defendant.Â  Cf. \r\nState v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474 S.E.2d 430, 431&nbsp;(1996) (charging\r\n  voluntary manslaughter).&nbsp; However, an instruction should not be\r\n  given unless justified by the evidence.Â  State v. Moultrie, 273 S.C.\r\n  532, 533, 257 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1979).Â  &quot;If a jury instruction is provided\r\n  to the jury that does not fit the facts of the case, it may confuse the jury.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Blurton,\r\n  352 S.C. 203, 208, 573 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002). Â This Court will not reverse the\r\n  trial court's ruling regarding jury instructions unless the trial court abused\r\n  its discretion.Â  State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443,\r\n  445 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nCommander points to John Pressley's\r\n  testimony as evidence of an accident.Â  Commander cites \r\nState v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 555 S.E.2d 391&nbsp;(2001), for the proposition\r\n  that inconsistencies in the evidence must not deprive a defendant of the\r\n  benefit of evidence supporting a jury charge on a lesser-included offense.Â  In Knoten,\r\n  our Supreme Court held that a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter was\r\n  required when the evidence included a confession that showed sufficient legal\r\n  provocation despite other evidence showing that the defendant later recanted\r\n  the confession.Â  Id. at 308-09, 555 S.E.2d at 397-98.\r\nEven if we disregard Commander's admission\r\n  to Pressley that he was not unconscious when he fell on Goodwin, Commander's\r\n  earlier strategy\r\n  session with Pressley indicated that Commander merely sought advice on what to\r\n  tell his attorney.Â  In our view, this does not constitute evidence of an accident. Â Therefore, the\r\n  trial court acted well within its discretion in declining to charge the jury on\r\n  the defense of accident.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Commander's conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] &quot;Mummified&quot; means that the body is dried out from a low level of\r\n  humidity so that the skin surfaces are relatively maintained and the internal\r\n  organs maintain their shape in the normal anatomic relationships.Â  The State's\r\n  expert in forensic pathology, Dr. Clay Nichols, stated that Goodwin's body\r\n  could have dried out from being left in her heated home for several weeks.Â  \r\n[2] Rule 702, SCRE,\r\n  states the following: Â &quot;If scientific, technical, or other specialized\r\n  knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\r\n  determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,\r\n  skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of\r\n  an opinion or otherwise.&quot;\r\n[3] The trial court\r\n  relied on the opinion of Maine's Supreme Judicial Court in \r\nState v. Young, 662 A.2d 904\r\n  (Me. 1995), in which the court held that a medical examiner's testimony that the\r\n  victim's death was a homicide neither exceeded the examiner's area of expertise\r\n  nor invaded the province of the factfinder.Â  The opinion explained that the trial court\r\n  could prevent any potential prejudice by explaining that the term &quot;homicide&quot;\r\n  merely distinguishes death caused by another human being from accidental and\r\n  natural deaths and suicide.\r\n[4] In Douglas, the defendant, who had been convicted of committing a lewd act on a minor, argued\r\n  that the trial court erred in qualifying a witness who had interviewed the\r\n  victim as an expert in forensic interviewing and in admitting her testimony\r\n  that, based on the interview, she concluded that a medical evaluation was\r\n  necessary.Â  Id. at 500-01, 671 S.E.2d at 607.Â  The defendant argued\r\n  that the witness' testimony was prejudicial because the jury likely gave her\r\n  testimony undue weight simply because of her qualification as an expert.Â  Id. at 503, 671 S.E.2d at 609.Â \r\n  The Court held that the disputed testimony was not required to be presented by\r\n  an expert witness, but that the defendant was not prejudiced by her\r\n  qualification as an expert because such qualification did not require the jury\r\n  to accord her testimony any greater weight than that given to any other\r\n  witness.Â  Id. at 502-03, 671 S.E.2d at 608-09.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4561","title":"Trotter v.

Scott\r\n  James, III, an orthopedist, for the following week.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 7, 2005, Dr. James examined Claimant and scheduled an MRI.Â  Claimant testified she called Carlos Mays in\r\n  Employer's personnel department to inform him Dr. James had advised her to not\r\n  work.Â  Claimant stated Mays told her to\r\n  bring in the doctor's slip, and Charleston made of copy of the document.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the MRI, Dr. James recommended Claimant undergo surgery, which she did on\r\n  February 21, 2005.Â  Claimant applied for\r\n  and began receiving short-term disability benefits from Employer, which ended\r\n  in April 2005.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 28, 2005, Claimant participated in a conference call with Charleston, Duboo, Mays, and Adrian Barnhill, Employer's human resource\r\n  manager.Â  During this call, Claimant\r\n  revealed she had undergone surgery, and she subsequently provided a written\r\n  statement documenting her claim.Â Â Â  \r\n On May 11, 2005, Claimant filed a Form 50 alleging &quot;an\r\n  accidental injury to her back on 2-4-05&quot; caused by repetitive &quot;lifting,\r\n  pulling and pushing.&quot;Â  Claimant also\r\n  stated she gave verbal notice to her &quot;supervisor&quot; on February 4,\r\n  2005.Â  In response, Employer denied the\r\n  claim pending further investigation because (1) Claimant failed to provide notice\r\n  prior to proceeding with the surgery, and (2) Employer found no evidence\r\n  Claimant's back complaints and her job duties were causally connected.Â  A hearing was scheduled for September 20,\r\n  2005.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPrior to the hearing, Employer made two motions.Â  The first motion was to add Spherion as a\r\n  defendant in the suit.Â  Employer made\r\n  this request because &quot;Claimant's medical report state[d] that 'this\r\n  [medical condition] has really been going on for the past several months'[,\r\n  and] . . . Claimant ha[s] only been employed by [Employer] for approximately\r\n  two and a half months.&quot;Â  The single commissioner\r\n  denied the motion.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the second motion, Employer requested a continuance due to the difficulty it\r\n  faced in scheduling a deposition with Dr. James.Â  Employer originally scheduled Dr. James's\r\n  deposition for September 7, 2005.Â  Due in\r\n  part to Employer's plan to also depose Claimant on that date, Employer\r\n  rescheduled Dr. James's deposition for September 14, 2005.Â  Dr. James later canceled the deposition and\r\n  rescheduled for October 3, 2005.Â  The\r\n  single commissioner denied the motion.Â Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Employer requested the record remain open for Dr. James's\r\n  deposition.Â  Employer additionally\r\n  requested the record remain open for the deposition of Charleston.Â  He was unable to attend the hearing due to\r\n  his hospitalization for stomach cancer complications.Â  The single commissioner denied the request as\r\n  to Dr. James's deposition, finding Employer had the opportunity to depose him\r\n  but chose not to for strategic reasons.Â  The single commissioner, however, granted the request as to Charleston\r\n  and agreed to leave the record open for fourteen days.Â  As of October 4, 2005, Charleston's doctors\r\n  stated he was still incapacitated, so Employer requested an &quot;additional\r\n  period of time to allow the parties to proceed with the deposition of Mr.\r\n  Charleston.&quot;Â  This request was\r\n  granted, and the single commissioner allowed the record to remain open until\r\n  October 20, 2005.Â  Notice of this extension was mailed to\r\n  Employer October 20, 2005, and was therefore received after the record had\r\n  already been closed.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner issued an order on May 5,\r\n  2006.Â  In this order, the single commissioner\r\n  found:\r\n\r\n  That on\r\n    or about December 31, 2004[, Claimant] felt a pop in her back while\r\n    working.Â  She continued to work until\r\n    February 4, 2005, causing further injury to her low back. . . . [Claimant]\r\n    properly and timely reported the problems with her back to both her team leader[, Cloud,] and to her supervisor, Pat Charleston. . .\r\n    . [O]n [Claimant's] first visit to a medical doctor [(Dr. James)] after the\r\n    injury, she reported a work related injury to her lower back. . . . Dr. James\r\n    causally related her low back complaints and resulting injury to the job that\r\n    [Claimant] performed with [Employer]. . . . [T]he workers' compensation carrier\r\n    for [Employer] shall reimburse [Claimant's] private insurance carrier for all\r\n    causally related medical treatment incurred since the accident date of December\r\n    31, 2004. . . . [Employer] is the employer responsible for this claim and that\r\n    all benefits referenced in this Order shall be provided through them.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe Appellate Panel sustained the single commissioner's\r\n  order in its entirety, as did the circuit court.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (the APA) governs this\r\n  Court's standard of review in appeals from the Appellate Panel.Â  Hopper v. Terry Hunt\r\n    Constr., 373 S.C. 475, 479, 646 S.E.2d 162, 164 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;In an appeal from the [Appellate Panel],\r\n  neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that\r\n  of the [Appellate Panel] as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.&quot;Â  Id.Â  However, an appellate court may reverse or modify a decision of the Appellate\r\n  Panel &quot;if the findings and conclusions of the administrative agency are\r\n  affected by error of law, clearly erroneous in view of the reliable and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record, or arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  Gray\r\n    v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 182, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEmployer argues the Appellate Panel abused its discretion\r\n  by affirming the single commissioner's refusal to grant Employer's pretrial\r\n  motion for a continuance in order to allow for the depositions of two key\r\n  witnesses to be taken.Â  We agree. \r\n&quot;Administrative agencies are required to meet minimum\r\n  standards of due process,&quot; and &quot;[i]n cases\r\n  where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process at least\r\n  requires an opportunity to present favorable witnesses.&quot;Â  Smith v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Mental Health, 329 S.C. 485, 500, 494 S.E.2d 630, 638 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  &quot;An administrative or quasi judicial\r\n  body is allowed a wide latitude of procedure and [is]\r\n  not restricted to the strict rule of evidence adhered to in a judicial\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Hallums v. Michelin Tire\r\n    Corp., 308 S.C. 498, 504, 419 S.E.2d 235, 239 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Great liberality is to be exercised in\r\n  allowing the introduction of evidence in workers' compensation\r\n  proceedings.Â  Hamilton v. Bob Bennett\r\n    Ford, 339 S.C. 68, 70, 528 S.E.2d 667, 668 (2000); see Brown v. La\r\n      France Indus., 286 S.C. 319, 324-25, 333 S.E.2d 348, 351 (Ct. App. 1985)\r\n  (stating a single commissioner has similar discretion as that of a trial judge\r\n  in deciding whether to reopen a case for the introduction of additional\r\n  evidence).Â Â Â  \r\nA motion for continuance due to the absence of a material\r\n  witness is addressed to the judge's discretion, and therefore, the ruling will\r\n  not be disturbed unless it is shown to be an abuse of discretion.Â  Logan v. Gatti, 289 S.C. 546, 548, 347 S.E.2d 506, 507 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986).Â  This abuse of discretion\r\n  must result in prejudice to the moving party.Â  Hudson v. Blanton, 282 S.C. 70, 74, 316 S.E.2d\r\n  432, 434 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Additionally, &quot;[t]o justify a continuance, the moving party must\r\n  show not only the absence of some material evidence but also due diligence on\r\n  his part to obtain it.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs to the deposition of Charleston, we find the Appellate\r\n  Panel abused its discretion by affirming the single commissioner's decision to\r\n  not grant Employer's motion for a continuance and to close the record without\r\n  Charleston's deposition being taken.Â  As\r\n  Claimant's supervisor, Charleston was the person whom Claimant was to inform\r\n  regarding any work related injury.Â  From\r\n  the beginning, Employer contested Claimant's claim arguing Claimant failed to\r\n  give notice of her injury prior to seeking medical help from Dr. James.Â  Charleston's testimony would undoubtedly be\r\n  material evidence to the issue of notice, and without his testimony, Employer had\r\n  no way of contesting the issue.Â  Charleston's\r\n  testimony was so crucial and important to Employer's defense that its exclusion\r\n  constitutes prejudicial error.Â  See Guffey v. Columbia/Colleton Reg'l Hosp., Inc., 364 S.C. 158, 170-71, 612 S.E.2d\r\n  695, 701 (2005) (stating an appellate court considers whether &quot;the wrongly\r\n  excluded evidence or testimony was so crucial and important in proving the\r\n  aggrieved party's claim or defense that its exclusion constitutes prejudicial\r\n  error&quot;).\r\nAdditionally, the record contains ample evidence Employer\r\n  exercised due diligence in obtaining Charleston's deposition, but through no\r\n  fault of its own was unable to provide that evidence prior to the closing of\r\n  the record.Â  Employer planned to have\r\n  Charleston testify in person at the hearing, but when that was not possible\r\n  because of Charleston's hospitalization, Employer then sought to depose\r\n  Charleston at the first opportunity his doctors would allow.Â  The record, however, was closed before\r\n  Employer was able to do so.Â  \r\n  While the exact date on which Charleston would become available for a\r\n  deposition was unknown, Employer did not make any unreasonable requests, such\r\n  as keeping the record open indefinitely. Â In fact, the record was only left open for one\r\n  month, while the single commissioner's order was not issued until nearly seven\r\nmonths following the hearing.Â Â Â Â  \r\nBecause we find the evidence Employer contemplated offering\r\n  through Charleston's testimony was crucial, and because Employer exercised due\r\n  diligence in obtaining that testimony, we find the Appellate Panel abused its\r\n  discretion by not granting Employer's motion for continuance or keeping the\r\n  record open for Charleston's deposition.Â  See Logan, 289 S.C. at 548-49, 347 S.E.2d at 507-08 (holding\r\n  it was &quot;an error of law and consequently an abuse of discretion&quot; to deny\r\n  a motion for continuance when &quot;only a two and one-half month\r\n  continuance&quot; was sought, the motion was based upon the witness's absence\r\n  after being unexpectedly ordered to sea, and the deposition was purely a\r\n  discovery deposition); see also Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 322,\r\n  548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001) (finding respondent should have been permitted to\r\n  complete discovery when the record did not &quot;support a finding that\r\n  [respondent] was dilatory in pursuing discovery&quot; because depositions were\r\n  scheduled for the week following the hearing but were postponed and this delay\r\n  was not solely attributable to respondent).Â Â Â  \r\nConcerning the testimony of Dr. James, we likewise find the\r\n  Appellate Panel abused its discretion by affirming the single commissioner's\r\n  order not allowing for either a continuance or for the record to remain open\r\n  for his deposition to be taken.Â  Dr.\r\n  James was Claimant's treating physician and, as such, had unique and crucial\r\n  testimony which could not be offered by any other witness or through his\r\n  medical records alone.Â  By not allowing\r\n  Employer to take Dr. James's deposition, Employer was left with no way of\r\n  challenging Claimant's medical claims.Â  The Appellate Panel's ruling was, therefore, not harmless to Employer,\r\n  and Employer was prejudiced.Â  See Means\r\n    v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 171, 558 S.E.2d 921, 926 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  (&quot;[W]e find exclusion of the [expert testimony of a neuropsychologist] was\r\n  not harmless error as there was no equivalent testimony presented to this\r\n  effect.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Employer sought to depose Dr. James prior to the hearing, but due to scheduling\r\n  difficulties, the deposition was scheduled for a date after the hearing.Â  Although Employer rescheduled the deposition\r\n  once, Employer exercised due diligence to try and take the deposition prior to\r\n  the hearing.Â  Dr. James, rather than\r\n  Employer, was the party unavailable before the hearing.Â  The record contained no evidence of\r\n  misconduct, intentional or otherwise, by Employer that would warrant the\r\n  exclusion of this crucial witness.Â  See Orlando v. Boyd, 320 S.C. 509, 512, 466 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1996)\r\n  (&quot;[T]here is no evidence of intentional misconduct in the record which\r\n  would warrant the exclusion of a crucial witness.&quot;).Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find Employer exercised due diligence in trying to depose both Dr. James and\r\n  Charleston in a timely manner, and Employer was prejudiced by the exclusion of\r\n  their testimony because it was necessary evidence for the Appellate Panel to\r\n  make an informed decision.Â  Thus, the Appellate\r\n  Panel abused its discretion in excluding this testimony.Â  We, therefore, reverse the order of the\r\n  circuit court affirming the Appellate Panel and remand the case to the Appellate\r\n  Panel to allow for additional testimony from Dr. James and Charleston.[2]Â  At the conclusion of this testimony, the Appellate\r\n  Panel shall issue new findings of facts and conclusions of law based on the\r\n  overall record.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn light of our decision to reverse and remand this case\r\n  for further testimony, and because we believe the additional testimony could\r\n  affect Employer's remaining arguments, we vacate the remainder of the circuit\r\n  court's order and remand all issues to the Appellate Panel for reconsideration\r\n  following the taking of the additional testimony.[3] Â See Smith, 329 S.C. at 501-02,\r\n  494 S.E.2d at 638 (stating while an appellate court recognizes the Appellate\r\n  Panel is the sole fact-finder in workers' compensation cases, the improper\r\n  exclusion of testimony by the single commissioner amounted to an error of law\r\n  that deprived the claimant of his right to present his case and deprived the Appellate\r\n  Panel of the evidence it needed to make its findings of fact); see, e.g., Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283, 297, 473 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) (holding the issue of alimony should be remanded for reconsideration\r\n  because the issue of equitable division was being remanded and would affect the\r\n  issue of alimony).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED\r\n  IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Claimant's start date with Employer is in\r\n  dispute.Â  Claimant argues she began\r\n  working for Employer November 15, 2004, while Employer claims she did not begin\r\n  until December 6, 2004.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] From a practical standpoint, the single\r\n  commissioner's two rulings on keeping the record open for depositions appear\r\n  inconsistent.Â  Because the single\r\n  commissioner was already allowing the record to remain open for Charleston's\r\n  deposition, allowing the record to also remain open for the deposition of Dr.\r\n  James would cause no further delay.Â Â Â  \r\n[3] Employer's remaining arguments, which should all be\r\n  reconsidered on remand, are: (1) the Appellate Panel abused its discretion by\r\n  refusing to grant Employer's pretrial motion to add Spherion as an additional\r\n  defendant; (2) the Appellate Panel erred in finding Claimant suffered a\r\n  compensable injury arising out of and in the course of her employment; (3) the\r\n  Appellate Panel erred in determining Claimant suffered a compensable injury by\r\n  accident arising out of and in the course and scope of her employment; and (4)\r\n  the Appellate Panel erred in failing to address the issue of credit for\r\n  disability payments made outside the scope of a work related injury.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4562","title":"Walrath v.

Schusterman, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n        Paul V. Degenhart, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Matthew Walrath (Father) appeals the family court's order finding\r\n  Stephanie Pope (Mother) should retain custody of the couple's two minor\r\n  children even if Mother moves out of state.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  Â \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFather and Mother\r\n  married in March 1998 in Texas.Â  They had two children while married, a\r\n  daughter born in 1999 and a son born in 2000.Â  The couple later divorced in\r\n  Texas in June 2002.Â  Pursuant to the Texas Divorce Decree (the Decree), Father\r\n  and Mother were granted joint custody of the children, with primary custody\r\n  being awarded to Mother.Â  Additionally, the Decree gave Mother the right to\r\n  establish the primary residence of the two children.Â  Mother was required to\r\n  give Father sixty days notice if she intended to move with the children. Â Â \r\nMother moved with\r\n  the children from Texas to Maryland for a job opportunity in June 2003.Â  Father\r\n  followed the family to Maryland in order to remain close to the children.Â \r\n  Father eventually found employment as a facility supervisor.Â  While in\r\n  Maryland, Mother married her current husband (Stepfather) and had a child with\r\n  him. \r\nIn May 2004, Mother\r\n  gave Father notice she would be moving with the children to Blythewood, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Stepfather had an opportunity to practice law with a South Carolina\r\n  firm, which would allow Mother to stay at home with the children.Â  Father again\r\n  followed Mother and the children, relocating to Fort Mill where he was able to\r\n  get a job with his same company.Â  While living in Fort Mill, Father began\r\n  dating and eventually married his current wife (Stepmother).Â  \r\nAfter Stepfather\r\n  began to experience some job difficulties, Mother began to search for a job.Â \r\n  Mother searched in the Columbia and Charlotte areas but with no success.Â \r\n  Eventually she expanded her search to other states and was able to secure a job\r\n  working out of her home in South Carolina for a company in the Kansas City\r\n  area.Â  After her company told her she must relocate to Kansas City, Missouri in\r\n  order to keep her job, Mother gave Father notice of her intended move.Â  Father\r\n  then brought this action, asking for a change of custody or, in the\r\n  alternative, an order prohibiting Mother from moving the children to Kansas\r\n  City.Â  A hearing was held.Â  The family court found no change of custody was in\r\n  order, and Mother was allowed to move the children.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a family court order, this Court may find facts based on its view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 522-23,\r\n  599 S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not\r\n  relieve the appealing party of the burden of showing the family court committed\r\n  error.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34 (2004).Â \r\n  Additionally, this Court is not required to disregard the family court's\r\n  findings, as it was in the position to see and hear the witnesses and was\r\n  therefore in a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  Patel,\r\n  359 S.C. at 523, 599 S.E.2d at 118.Â  &quot;This degree of deference is\r\n  especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of the\r\n  [children].&quot;Â  Latimer, 360 S.C. at 380, 602 S.E.2d at 34.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred in determining custody of the children should\r\n  remain with Mother even if she moves to Kansas City.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina\r\n  courts have recognized the difficulty of the issue we have before us: balancing\r\n  the custodial parent's right to relocate with the minor children against the\r\n  non-custodial parent's &quot;right to continue his or her relationship with the\r\n  [children] as established before the custodial parent's relocation.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  This issue is made even more difficult when both parents share a devoted and\r\n  loving relationship with the children, as Mother and Father do in the current\r\n  situation.Â  In resolving this issue, however, our Supreme Court has stated we\r\n  are no longer to be guided by the presumption against relocation, and should\r\n  instead focus on the children's best interests.Â  Id. at 381, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  at 34-35.Â Â  \r\n&quot;In all child\r\n  custody cases, including relocation cases, the controlling considerations are\r\n  the [children's] welfare and best interests.&quot;Â  Id. at 381, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 35.Â  When a change in custody is sought, the non-custodial parent\r\n  must show a change in circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the\r\n  divorce decree.Â  Id.Â  This change of circumstances must be such that it\r\n  would substantially affect the interests and welfare of the children, not\r\n  merely the parties, their wishes, or their convenience.Â  Sharpe v. Sharpe,\r\n  256 S.C. 517, 521, 183 S.E.2d 325, 327 (1971).Â  Additionally, &quot;it is\r\n  incumbent upon the moving party to show that the welfare of the [children]\r\n  requires the court to ignore and set aside the agreement of the parties\r\n  incorporated in the decree.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the overriding concern in all child custody matters is the best interests of\r\n  the children, when a change in custody is sought by the non-custodial parent,\r\n  that parent must establish (1) there has been a substantial change in\r\n  circumstances affecting the welfare of the children and (2) a change in custody\r\n  is in the overall best interests of the children.Â  Latimer, 360 S.C. at\r\n  381, 602 S.E.2d at 35.Â  \r\nA\r\n  change in the custodial parent's residence is not in itself a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children that justifies a\r\n  change in custody.Â  Id. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35.Â  \r\n\r\n  Relocation\r\n    is one factor in considering a change in circumstances, but is not alone a\r\n    sufficient change in circumstances.Â  One location may not necessarily affect\r\n    the best interests of the [children] as would another.Â  The effect of\r\n    relocation on the [children's] best interest[s] is highly fact specific.Â  It\r\n    should not be assumed that merely relocating and potentially burdening the\r\n    non-custodial parent's visitation rights always negatively affects the\r\n    [children's] best interests.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  South Carolina has not delineated criteria for evaluating whether the best\r\n  interests of the children are served in relocation cases, our Supreme Court has\r\n  acknowledged, without endorsing or specifically approving, factors other states\r\n  consider when making this determination.Â  Id.Â  For example, our Supreme\r\n  Court stated the New York Court of Appeals looks at (1) each parent's reason\r\n  for seeking or opposing the relocation; (2) the relationship between the\r\n  children and each parent; (3) the impact of the relocation on the quality of\r\n  the children's future contact with the non-custodial parent; (4) the economic,\r\n  emotional, and educational enhancements of the move; and (5) the feasibility of\r\n  preserving the children's relationship with the non-custodial parent through\r\n  visitation arrangements.Â  Id. at 382-83, 602 S.E.2d at 35-36 (citing Tropea\r\n    v. Tropea, 665 N.E.2d 145, 148 (N.Y. 1996)).Â  Additionally, our Supreme\r\n  Court noted Pennsylvania courts require the following considerations in\r\n  relocation cases: (1) the economic and other potential advantages of the move;\r\n  (2) the likelihood the move would substantially improve the quality of life for\r\n  the custodial parent and the children and is not the result of a whim of the\r\n  custodial parent; (3) the motives behind the parent's reasons for seeking or\r\n  opposing the move; and (4) the availability of a realistic substitute\r\n  visitation arrangement that will adequately foster an ongoing relationship\r\n  between the non-custodial parent and the children.Â  Id. at 383, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 36 (citing Gancas v. Schultz, 683 A.2d 1207, 1210 (Pa. Super.\r\n  Ct. 1996)).Â Â Â Â  \r\nApplying some of\r\n  these factors to the present case, while keeping in mind the overriding\r\n  consideration of the children's best interests is paramount, we affirm the\r\n  family court's order allowing custody of the children to remain with Mother\r\n  even if she relocates with the children to Kansas City.Â  \r\nWe first note the\r\n  integrity of the motives behind each parent's reason for seeking or opposing\r\n  the move does not weigh against either parent, as neither Mother nor Father\r\n  demonstrated any spiteful or vindictive motives.Â  Mother testified as to the\r\n  financial reasons behind the move to Kansas City and the difficulty she has had\r\n  trying to find employment closer to South Carolina.Â  Mother also testified she\r\n  believed the move was in the children's best interests.Â  Likewise, Father\r\n  testified his only reason for opposing the move was because he believed it was\r\n  in the children's best interests to be allowed to &quot;settle down&quot; in\r\n  South Carolina where they have become a part of the community.Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, both\r\n  Mother and Father share a healthy, loving relationship with the children.Â  The\r\n  guardian ad litem (GAL) testified this was a case involving not only two good\r\n  parents, but also two stepparents that love the children.Â  After spending time\r\n  with the children in both households and recognizing the strong relationship\r\n  each parent shares with the children, the GAL recommended the family court\r\n  allow Mother to move to Kansas City.Â  The family court also found that even\r\n  though &quot;[b]oth parents should be commended for putting their children\r\n  first[,] . . . the children are doing well under the current situation while\r\n  being in [Mother's] care.&quot;Â  The family court noted the children are\r\n  &quot;flourishing while being in the primary care of [Mother].&quot;Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, the move\r\n  to Kansas City will provide potential advantages to the children, which were\r\n  discussed at the hearing.Â  With the move, Mother will be able to provide the\r\n  children with economic security she cannot provide if she were to remain in\r\n  South Carolina.Â  This economic security includes not only a comfortable income\r\n  but also affordable health insurance.Â  Additionally, Mother testified the\r\n  company she works for believes in a balance between work and home life, which\r\n  will allow for more time with the children.Â  Furthermore, Mother testified she\r\n  has lots of family and friends in the area, which would provide a support\r\n  system for the entire family.Â  This testimony, as well as other testimony that\r\n  Mother has already looked into schools and housing in the Kansas City area,\r\n  additionally demonstrates Mother has put a great deal of thought into the\r\n  potential move to Kansas City and the move is not the result of a whim on her\r\n  part.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, when\r\n  looking into the availability of a realistic substitute visitation arrangement\r\n  between Father and the children, the family court acknowledged Father stated he\r\n  will move to Kansas City if Mother is allowed to move there with the children.Â \r\n  If Father follows through with this move, Father's visitation with the children\r\n  will likely increase.Â  Mother stated she would allow Father to pick the\r\n  neighborhood she would move to, in hopes that both parents would live in the\r\n  same area, which would cut down on the children's travel time between the two\r\n  households and allow Father to attend more of the children's activities.Â  The\r\n  family court, however, also provided for continued visitation while Father\r\n  remains in South Carolina.Â  The family court was able to provide a new schedule\r\n  that allowed Father to continue to have visitation with the children every\r\n  other weekend and alternating holidays as the Decree allowed.Â  This new\r\n  schedule included the added benefit of Mother reimbursing Father for one\r\n  airline ticket per month if he chooses to fly to Kansas City to visit the\r\n  children.Â  Although we acknowledge the relationship between Father and the\r\n  children will be significantly affected if Father remains in South Carolina,\r\n  the family court's order acknowledged the new hardships and did its best to\r\n  provide the children with continuous and meaningful contact with Father.Â  \r\nAfter considering\r\n  all of the evidence presented and giving deference to the family court, we find\r\n  Father has failed to establish a substantial change in circumstances affecting\r\n  the welfare of the children.Â  We, therefore, do not believe a change in custody\r\n  is in the children's best interests.[1]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family court's\r\n  order is\r\nAFFIRMED.[2]\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Father states that if a change in custody is\r\n  not granted, an alternate ground to his argument is that this Court should\r\n  prohibit Mother from moving, Father never makes a separate argument for this\r\n  alternate position.Â  His brief only addresses the change of conditions that\r\n  should allow for a change of custody, and therefore, we decline to address this\r\n  argument.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating an issue is deemed abandoned and\r\n  will not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not\r\n  supported by authority).Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4563","title":"Tracy v.

Wife shall bear sole\r\n    responsibility for the costs for preparing these returns and shall be solely\r\n    responsible for any tax liability associated with these tax years.\r\n  . . . \r\n  Husband\r\n    shall loan Wife $15,000 . . . and such loan shall be secured along with her\r\n    obligation to pay a portion of Husband's attorney's fees/costs, her obligation\r\n    to reimburse Husband for her share of the tax liability for 2006 and her\r\n    responsibility for 100% of the tax liability associated with 2004 and 2005 with\r\n    a first mortgage against [her property] . . . . The note and mortgage shall\r\n    reflect an initial amount of $35,000 ($15,000 loan and $20,000 for attorney's\r\n    fees/costs) and shall have a future advance clause securing her obligation as\r\n    to her tax liability as specified above.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Order\r\n  provided any violation &quot;shall be considered Contempt of Court.&quot;Â  \r\nOn May 16, 2007, Mr. Tracy filed a Rule to Show Cause,\r\n  requesting the court require Ms. Tracy to show cause why she should not be held in contempt of court for noncompliance with the\r\n  terms and conditions of the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  The family court found Ms. Tracy failed to\r\n  comply with certain time limits set forth in the Final Order, specifically\r\n  noting the requirement of filing the tax returns and forwarding the\r\n  payment.Â  Nevertheless, the family court\r\n  determined Ms. Tracy's noncompliance was not willful, and thus, did not hold her\r\n  in contempt.Â  Specifically, the court\r\n  noted Ms. Tracy delayed her execution and forwarding of the tax returns because\r\n  her two minor children's social security numbers were incorrect, depriving her\r\n  of the deductions, and the correction took approximately four months to\r\n  resolve.Â  Thus, the court did not find\r\n  her in willful contempt because the court believed she had a valid reason for\r\n  requesting the corrections.Â  \r\nAddressing Ms. Tracy's noncompliance with the Order by not\r\n  paying the 2004 and 2005 taxes, the family court noted she entered into negotiations\r\n  with the IRS for an OIC.Â  The court again\r\n  found her conduct was not willful:Â &quot;She signed the returns, obtained a mortgage for the funds\r\n  necessary to pay off the obligations, contacted the taxing authorities,\r\n  completed and filed the Offers in Compromise with the required partial payments\r\n  and held the balance of the funds with an escrow agent.&quot;Â  Moreover, the family court stated:\r\n\r\n  At the\r\n    time the agreement was approved, [Ms. Tracy] was without funds to meet the\r\n    financial obligations imposed; for she had to borrow money from [Mr. Tracy] to\r\n    purchase the home.Â  Subsequently, she\r\n    obtained a mortgage and paid off [Mr. Tracy] with the balance of the funds\r\n    placed in escrow.Â  Her delay in obtaining\r\n    the mortgage funds for the payment of the obligations was, in my opinion, not\r\n    entirely her fault; for she had difficulty in obtaining the payoff amount from\r\n    [Mr. Tracy] as to his existing mortgage.Â  Her borrowing capacity is limited by her income and although she\r\n    initially obtained funds, which she believe[d] to be sufficient to pay the\r\n    obligations, this turned out not to be the case.Â  For the actual tax amounts exceeded the\r\n    figure contained on the spread sheet attached to the parties' agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the family\r\n  court found Ms. Tracy's testimony credible, especially regarding her belief\r\n  that the amount of tax liability she was assuming was contained on the\r\n  spreadsheet attached to the parties' agreement, which was approximately\r\n  $30,000, and the actual amount exceeded $40,000.Â  \r\nWith regard to Mr. Tracy's lien status on Ms. Tracy's\r\n  property, the family court stated it was difficult to understand because\r\n  &quot;once he was paid the funds owed, his lien status became a\r\n  non-issue.&quot;Â  Finally, the family\r\n  court dismissed the Rule to Show Cause, found Ms. Tracy was not in contempt,\r\n  and authorized Carroll Padgett (Ms. Tracy's escrow agent) to disburse the funds\r\n  for the OIC.Â  Mr. Tracy moved for\r\n  reconsideration and the family court denied his motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has\r\n  the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102\r\n  (2005).Â  However, despite our\r\n  broad scope of review, we remain mindful of the family court's findings because\r\n  it is the family court who observed the witnesses, and who was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate the witnesses' credibility and assign comparative weight\r\n  to their testimony.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Contempt\r\nMr.\r\n  Tracy argues the family court erred in failing to find Ms. Tracy in contempt\r\n  for:Â  (1) willful failure to provide\r\n  payment to the IRS and respective state agencies when she forwarded the\r\n  parties' joint 2004 and 2005 income taxes as required by the Final Order and\r\n  Decree of Divorce; and (2) willful failure to provide him with a first mortgage\r\n  on her property to protect his interest as required by the Final Order and\r\n  Decree of Divorce.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  trial court's determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it\r\n  is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has\r\n  been an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Henderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994).Â  &quot;An abuse\r\n  of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law\r\n  or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary\r\n  support.&quot;Â  Townsend\r\n    v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n  A party\r\n    may be found in contempt of court for the willful violation of a lawful court\r\n    order.Â  Before a party may be found in\r\n    contempt, the record must clearly and specifically show the contemptuous\r\n    conduct.Â  In a proceeding for contempt\r\n    for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a\r\n    court order and the facts establishing the respondent's noncompliance with the\r\n    order.Â  At the same time, we remain\r\n    cognizant that &quot;contempt is an extreme measure and the power to adjudge a\r\n    person in contempt is not to be lightly asserted.&quot;\r\n\r\nHawkins\r\n  v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal citations omitted).\r\nSection 63-3-620 of the South Carolina Code provides the\r\n  penalties for an adult's violation of a court's order: &quot;An adult who wilfully violates,\r\n  neglects, or refuses to obey or perform a lawful order of the court, or who\r\n  violates any provision of this title, may be proceeded against for contempt of\r\n  court.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-620 (2008).[1]Â  \r\nHere, Ms. Tracy testified at length regarding her efforts\r\n  to comply with the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  She stated she began attempting to obtain a\r\n  mortgage the day after the Final Order and Decree of Divorce was entered.Â  Ms. Tracy indicated she obtained a letter\r\n  from the first company she sought a mortgage from stating it would not give her\r\n  a mortgage because Mr. Tracy would not release a note with the payoff\r\n  amount.Â  Additionally, Ms. Tracy\r\n  contended Mr. Tracy continually contacted the taxing authorities to complicate\r\n  her attempts to resolve the situation.[2]Â  His interference required her to constantly\r\n  check with the agencies to ensure she was getting all the necessary\r\n  information.Â  As a result of his conduct,\r\n  Ms. Tracy contended she had to hire an escrow agent, Carroll Padgett, to finally\r\n  obtain the payoff amount and secure a mortgage.Â  In response to Mr. Tracy's allegation Ms. Tracy paid personal debts\r\n  before the tax liabilities, Ms. Tracy explained she had to pay the approximate\r\n  $6,000 in personal debt before being qualified for the mortgage.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Ms. Tracy explained she did not mail the\r\n  payment with the tax returns to the IRS because she had not closed on the\r\n  mortgage and did not have the money.Â  Moreover, she stated she would have forwarded the funds with the returns\r\n  if she had enough funds, but the estimate on the parties' agreement was\r\n  incorrect.Â  Ms. Tracy eventually obtained\r\n  a $90,000 mortgage on her house to pay her obligations under the Final Order\r\n  and Decree of Divorce.Â  \r\nAfter Padgett received the escrow funds,[3] he\r\n  began paying the tax agencies.Â  Ms. Tracy\r\n  indicated she paid the 2006 taxes, but entered into an OIC with the IRS for the\r\n  2004 and 2005 taxes, and filed the OIC as quickly as she could.Â  \r\nWith regard to the delay in filing the returns, David Gatti, Mr. Tracy's personal accountant, testified the taxes\r\n  contained incorrect social security numbers for Ms. Tracy's children and it\r\n  took him almost two months to correct the return.Â  \r\nHence, the family court did not err in refusing to\r\n  find Ms. Tracy in contempt for noncompliance with the Final Order and Decree of\r\n  Divorce.Â  While the record does contain\r\n  evidence that Ms. Tracy did not comply with all of the time limits set forth in\r\n  the Order, we find Ms. Tracy did not willfully violate, neglect, or refuse to\r\n  perform the duties proscribed in the Order.Â  Additionally, ample evidence in the record supports the family court's\r\n  findings.Â  \r\nIn addressing Mr. Tracy's contention that Ms. Tracy should\r\n  have maintained Mr. Tracy's first lien status on her property until the tax\r\n  liabilities are completely satisfied, we agree with the family court that his\r\n  argument is difficult to comprehend.Â  Once Mr. Tracy was paid the funds he was owed, his lien status essentially\r\n  became a non-issue because she no longer owed him money.Â  Ms. Tracy has accepted responsibility and has\r\n  taken appropriate measures to satisfy the tax liabilities through obtaining a\r\n  mortgage of her own and entering into an OIC with the IRS.Â  Accordingly, the family court properly found\r\n  Ms. Tracy was not in contempt for noncompliance with the Final Order and Decree\r\n  of Divorce.\r\nII. Offer In\r\n  Compromise\r\nMr.\r\n  Tracy argues the family court erred in allowing Ms. Tracy to enter into an\r\n  Offer In Compromise with the IRS.Â  Specifically, Mr. Tracy asserts the OIC does\r\n  not protect him from liability for the assessed tax amount.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Before\r\n  any action can be maintained, a justiciable controversy must be present.&quot;Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 546, 590 S.E.2d\r\n  338, 346 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;A justiciable controversy is a real and substantial\r\n  controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, as\r\n  distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.&quot;Â  Pee Dee Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Carolina\r\n    Power &amp; Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983); see\r\n      also Graham v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n  319 S.C. 69, 71, 459 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1995) (holding a justiciable controversy exists when a concrete issue is present, there is a definite assertion of legal rights, and a positive legal duty which\r\n  is denied by the adverse party).Â &quot;The concept of justiciability encompasses the doctrines of ripeness, mootness, and\r\n  standing.&quot;Â  Sloan, 356 S.C.\r\n  at 547, 590 S.E.2d at 346.Â  &quot;In determining a ripeness issue under\r\n  the 'case or controversy' requirement of Article III of the United States\r\n  Constitution, federal courts use a two-factor test:Â  (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial\r\n  decision, and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  Waters\r\n    v. S.C. Land Res. Conservation Comm'n, 321 S.C.\r\n  219, 227-28, 467 S.E.2d 913, 918 (1996).\r\nThe language in the Final Order and Decree of Divorce\r\n  gives Ms. Tracy the sole responsibility for any tax liability associated with\r\n  2004 and 2005.Â  Nowhere in the document\r\n  is Ms. Tracy restricted from entering into an OIC with the IRS to reduce the\r\n  tax liability.Â  Additionally, the IRS\r\n  accepted Ms. Tracy's OIC, and no evidence exists to indicate she has defaulted\r\n  on her responsibilities.Â  Moreover, this\r\n  issue is not ripe for review because Mr. Tracy has not been exposed to any\r\n  liability at this time as a result of Ms. Tracy entering into the OIC.Â  Furthermore, any claim Mr. Tracy may have is\r\n  contingent upon Ms. Tracy's nonpayment.Â  Lastly, during the Rule to Show Cause Hearing, the family court\r\n  specifically provided Mr. Tracy with the remedy of coming back before the court\r\n  if Ms. Tracy defaulted on her tax obligations.Â  Accordingly, the issue is not ripe for judicial decision and the parties\r\n  suffer no hardship from withholding a decision.\r\nIII. Attorneys' Fees and Costs\r\nMr.\r\n  Tracy alleges the family court erred in failing to award him attorneys' fees\r\n  and costs stemming from Ms. Tracy's contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  a family court matter, '[t]he award of attorney's fees is left to the\r\n  discretion of the trial judge and will only be disturbed upon a showing of\r\n  abuse of discretion.'&quot;Â  Abate v.\r\n    Abate, 377 S.C. 548, 555, 660 S.E.2d 515, 519 (Ct.

Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006)).Â  &quot;Under South Carolina law, the family\r\n  court has jurisdiction to determine whether to award attorney's fees in a\r\n  matter properly before it.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nHere,\r\n  Mr. Tracy does not contend the family court abused its discretion in declining\r\n  to award him attorneys' fees.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Mr. Tracy's issues were brought prematurely because he suffered no injury from\r\n  Ms. Tracy's actions.Â  Thus, the family\r\n  court did not err in declining to award Mr. Tracy attorneys' fees and costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 63-3-620 was formerly codified as section\r\n  20-7-1350 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2007).\r\n[2] An example of his interference was evidenced during\r\n  his cross-examination.Â  Ms. Tracy\r\n  identified six letters from taxing authorities where Mr. Tracy changed the\r\n  primary address from her home address to his home address.Â  Specifically, Mr. Tracy testified:Â  &quot;I didn't change the address so that\r\n  [Ms. Tracy] would not get any communications.Â  I did talk to the IRS and I did inform them that mine was the primary\r\n  social security number on [the return].&quot;Â  Additionally, Mr. Tracy contacted the IRS to inform them of the escrow\r\n  account, seemingly in an effort to thwart the OIC acceptance.Â  Ms. Tracy also testified Mr. Tracy called the\r\n  tax agencies to inform them that she had enough money to pay the taxes in\r\n  full.Â  \r\n[3] Ms. Tracy first paid Mr. Tracy $35,000 for the\r\n  $15,000 loan to purchase the house and $20,000 in attorneys' fees and costs,\r\n  pursuant to the Final Order and Decree of Divorce.Â  The remainder of the mortgage was placed in\r\n  an escrow account to satisfy the tax liabilities.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4564","title":"Robinson v.

Stern, Jr., of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Â Odell Haggins, Jr., as personal representative of the Estate of\r\n  Odell Haggins, Sr., and Phyllis Robinson, individually\r\n  and as personal representative of the Estate of Rodell Haggins, (collectively, Appellants), appeal from the\r\n  circuit court's order, arguing the court erred in finding the failure to\r\n  install smoke detectors in a rental home was not actionable under the South\r\n  Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (Landlord-Tenant Act), and notice was\r\n  an element of a landlord's liability for failing to maintain rental premises.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOdell Haggins, Sr. rented a house located in Seneca, South Carolina.Â  The house was owned by Merle Code.Â  In the morning hours of February 25, 2004,\r\n  while Odell Haggins, Sr., Rodell Haggins, and Phyllis Robinson were sleeping in the\r\n  house, an upholstered chair in the living room caught fire.Â  The home did not have smoke detectors.Â  When firefighters responded to the fire, they\r\n  found the bodies of Odell and Rodell, who both died\r\n  from carbon monoxide poisoning and smoke inhalation.Â  Robinson was found alive, but overcome by\r\n  smoke.\r\nRobinson\r\n  filed two complaints against Code, one on behalf of herself and one as the\r\n  personal representative of the estate of Rodell Haggins.Â  Haggins, Jr. also filed a complaint against Code as the\r\n  personal representative of the estate of Odell Haggins,\r\n  Sr.Â  The complaints alleged Code was\r\n  negligent for failing to supply and install smoke detectors in the rental\r\n  house.Â  Code filed a motion to strike the\r\n  allegations concerning the smoke detectors, and after a hearing, the circuit\r\n  court issued its order granting Code's motion to strike all allegations concerning\r\n  the smoke detectors.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nStandard of\r\nReview\r\nA\r\n  motion to strike, challenging a theory of recovery in the complaint, is comparable\r\n  to a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  McCormick v.\r\n    England, 328 S.C. 627, 632, 494 S.E.2d 431, 433 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  &quot;Where a pleading is attacked for an\r\n  alleged failure to state a cause of action, the pleading must be liberally\r\n  construed in favor of the pleader and sustained if the facts and reasonable\r\n  inferences to be drawn therefrom entitle the pleader\r\n  to relief on any theory of the case.&quot;Â  Burns v. Wannamaker, 286 S.C. 336, 339, 333\r\n  S.E.2d 358, 360 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  A court should not strike a cause of action merely because the court doubts\r\n  the plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  McCormick, at 633, 494 S.E.2d at 434.Â  However, the matter of striking from a\r\n  pleading is largely within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  Brown v. Coastal States\r\n    Life Ins. Co., 264 S.C. 190, 194, 213 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1975).Â  Thus, the grant of a motion to strike will\r\n  not be reversed except for an abuse of discretion or error of law.Â  Id. at 194-95, 213\r\n  S.E.2d at 728.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in finding Code's\r\n  failure to install smoke detectors in Haggins's rental home was not actionable under the Landlord-Tenant Act, and notice was an\r\n  element of a landlord's liability for failing to maintain rental premises.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Traditionally,\r\n  under the law of South Carolina, a landlord owes no duty to maintain leased\r\n  premises in a safe condition.&quot;Â  Young v. Morrisey, 285 S.C. 236, 239,\r\n  329 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1985).Â  However, the Landlord-Tenant Act,[1] enacted\r\n  in 1986, requires a landlord to comply with applicable housing codes materially\r\n  affecting health and safety, and &quot;make all repairs and do whatever is\r\n  reasonably necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable\r\n  condition.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-40-440(a)(1) and (2) (2007).Â  The Landlord-Tenant Act provides for recovery\r\n  of actual damages as a result of any material noncompliance by the landlord.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-40-610(a) and (b) (2007).Â  The Landlord-Tenant\r\n  Act mentions the delivery of &quot;a written notice to the landlord specifying\r\n  the acts and omissions constituting the breach.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-40-610(a) (2007).Â  Also, the Landlord-Tenant\r\n  Act provides a tenant's rights &quot;do not arise until he has given notice to\r\n  the landlord and the landlord fails to act within a reasonable time.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-40-630(d) (2007).Â  As a result,\r\n  this court has held the Landlord-Tenant Act creates a cause of action for a\r\n  tenant of residential property against the landlord, &quot;for failure, after\r\n  notice, to make necessary repairs and to do what is reasonably necessary to\r\n  keep the premises in a habitable condition.&quot;Â  Watson v. Sellers,\r\n  299 S.C. 426, 433, 385 S.E.2d 369, 373 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  The Landlord-Tenant Act does not specifically\r\n  mandate landlords must provide smoke detectors in their rental properties.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nArticle\r\n  11 of Building Codes and Fire Prevention,[2] enacted\r\n  in 1994, however, requires all one-family dwellings to be equipped with smoke\r\n  detectors.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 5-25-1310(A) (2004).Â  Article\r\n  11 mandates the owner of a rental dwelling is responsible for supplying and\r\n  installing smoke detectors in the home, and must provide the tenant with\r\n  instructions for testing and replacing the batteries in the smoke detectors.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  5-25-1330(A) (2004).Â  The Article\r\n  further states a tenant must notify the owner in writing of any deficiencies in the smoke detectors.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  5-25-1330(B) (2004).Â  However, Article\r\n  11 provides, &quot;[f]ailure to comply with the\r\n  provisions of this article does not create a cause of action for a per se\r\n  statutory violation of liability, or for negligence-based liability, for death,\r\n  injury, or damages.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-25-1380 (2004).Â  \r\nAppellants'\r\n  complaints alleged, in pertinent part, that Code was negligent for:\r\n\r\n  (a) Â Failing to\r\n    install smoke detectors in the dwelling;\r\n  (b) Failing to supply smoke detectors in the dwelling;\r\n  (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing to provide instructions on the use of smoke\r\n    detectors at the same time the tenant took possession of the building; and \r\n  (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing to comply with the requirements of applicable\r\n    building codes in effect materially effecting [sic]\r\n    the property.\r\n\r\nThe complaints did not state\r\n  which South Carolina code sections the Appellants claimed Code violated.[3]Â  Code filed a motion to strike pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(f), SCRCP.Â  &quot;In ruling on\r\n  such a motion, a Court decides whether a party should be allowed to plead a\r\n  defense or other matter, not whether there are facts supporting what has been\r\n  pleaded.&quot;Â  Alladin Plastics, Inc. v. Wintenna, Inc., 301 S.C. 90, 93, 390 S.E.2d 370,\r\n  372 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  \r\nCode moved to strike all allegations pertaining to smoke\r\n  detectors on the basis that Article 11 does not create a cause of action for\r\n  failure to install smoke detectors.Â  Article\r\n  11 specifically provides that failure of a landlord to supply or install smoke\r\n  detectors does not create a cause of action for a per se statutory violation of\r\n  liability, or for negligence-based liability, for death, injury, or\r\n  damages.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 5-25-1380 (2004).Â  Also, Appellants\r\n  did not allege they notified Code of the lack of smoke detectors in the home,\r\n  as required by the Article.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-25-1330(B) (2004).\r\nIn\r\n  response to Code's motion to strike, Appellants asserted they did not allege a\r\n  cause of action under Article 11, but rather under the Landlord-Tenant Act.Â  But, the Landlord-Tenant Act, which preceded Article\r\n  11 by eight years, does not specifically state landlords must provide smoke detectors in their rental properties.Â  This court has found the Landlord-Tenant Act requires\r\n  written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting\r\n  the breach and failure of the landlord to make the necessary repairs after\r\n  notice.Â  Watson, 299 S.C. at 433, 385 S.E.2d at 373.Â  Appellants' complaints do not allege that Haggins, Sr., notified Code of the lack\r\n  of smoke detectors in the residence or that Code failed to correct the problem\r\n  after notice.Â  Therefore, the trial court was correct in granting Code's motion because the complaints did not allege violations of the Landlord-Tenant Act, and Article\r\n  11 does not provide for a negligence\r\n  cause of action. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-10 to 940 (2007).\r\n[2]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-25-1310 to 1380 (2004).\r\n[3]Â  Although\r\n  Appellants did not state which South Carolina code sections their complaints were\r\n  based on, it appears from the allegations that Appellants were alleging Code\r\n  violated South Carolina Code sections 5-25-1310(A) and 5-25-1330(A).Â  S.C.

Husband further contends the family court erred in its\r\n  division of marital property by assigning no value to two vehicles, despite\r\n  Wife's testimony those vehicles were worth a total of $24,000.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife\r\n  married on May 24, 1997.Â  This was the parties' second marriage to each other.Â \r\n  They had two children born during their first marriage, one in 1978 and the\r\n  other in 1985, but none during their second marriage.Â  In 2005, Wife filed a\r\n  complaint seeking a divorce, alimony, the marital home, and the equitable\r\n  division of other property.Â  Husband filed an answer and counterclaim.Â  At\r\n  the beginning of the hearing on the matter, Wife withdrew her request for a\r\n  divorce.Â  Husband moved to supplement his pleadings to seek a divorce.Â  However, Wife objected based on insufficient notice and after Husband\r\n  conceded Wife lacked notice, the family court denied the motion.\r\nFollowing the hearing, the family court issued an\r\n  order awarding the Wife permanent, periodic alimony of $1,000 per month.Â  In\r\n  making that award, the court noted the marriage lasted eight years and both\r\n  parties were forty-eight years old and in good health.Â  The family court\r\n  determined Husband's gross monthly income was $3,585 from Georgia Pacific and\r\n  the Army Reserve, which was &quot;significantly higher&quot; than Wife's income\r\n  of $936 a month.Â  The court noted Wife currently worked as a housekeeper at\r\n  Holiday Inn Express but was previously employed as a welder.Â  The family court\r\n  found the parties had a modest standard of living; they lived in a mobile home\r\n  on land they owned.Â  The court further found &quot;Husband gave no reason for\r\n  leaving home&quot; and had &quot;moved in with another woman but claim[ed] to\r\n  be only a boarder in her home.&quot;Â  The court indicated the tax\r\n  consequences of a permanent, periodic alimony award were the alimony would be\r\n  deductible to Husband and taxable to Wife.Â  The court also determined\r\n  &quot;Wife's financial declaration reflects a need for assistance to be able to\r\n  realize her monthly budget. Â The Husband's declaration reflects the ability to\r\n  assist the Wife.&quot;Â  Based on those factors, the family court awarded\r\n  Wife permanent, periodic alimony of $1,000 per month.\r\nAdditionally, the family court determined although the\r\n  marital home had been Wife's premarital property, the couple transmuted it into\r\n  marital property.Â  The court found the land and mobile home had a net negative\r\n  value of $10,486 and apportioned it to Wife.Â  Husband had two retirement\r\n  accounts with a total value of $22,654, of which the family court found half to\r\n  be marital property.Â  The court determined, &quot;While the Husband made the\r\n  greater financial contributions, the Wife earned some outside income and was\r\n  the primary homemaker doing the traditional duties normally associated with the\r\n  Wife such that a 50/50% division of the marital estate is appropriate.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the family court awarded Wife $5,663 of Husband's retirement\r\n  accounts to be accomplished by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).\r\nThe family court also divided the parties' vehicles.Â  The court awarded Wife the Toyota Forerunner, which Wife had valued at\r\n  $9,000 and testified had a $9,000 balance remaining on it, and the Nissan\r\n  Maxima, which Wife valued at $15,000 with a $15,000 balance.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the court awarded Husband his truck, which had a net value of $6,000.\r\nThe family court found the total marital estate had a\r\n  net value of $6,840 and awarded each party half of that value.Â  Because\r\n  the property allocated to Wife had a negative value of $4,823 and Husband's allocation\r\n  had a positive value of $11,663, the family court ordered Husband pay Wife an\r\n  additional $8,243 out of his retirement accounts in the form of a QDRO.\r\nAs to attorney's fees, the family court found Wife's\r\n  attorney billed her at the rate of $150 an hour, which is the fee normally\r\n  charged in the locale.Â  The family court noted Wife was represented by\r\n  counsel who regularly appeared before it.Â  The family court also found\r\n  counsel obtained beneficial results for Wife; specifically, she was successful\r\n  in the issues raised in her complaint, was awarded the marital residence and\r\n  alimony, and successfully challenged Husband's motion to supplement the\r\n  pleadings. Â The family court also stated it considered Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), and Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 634 S.E.2d 51 (Ct. App. 2006), in\r\n  arriving at its award.Â  Although Wife's affidavit requested attorney's\r\n  fees of $4,885.50, the court acknowledged that figure did not take into account\r\n  preparing the QDRO, which the family court ordered Wife's counsel to prepare.Â  The\r\n  court determined Husband was in a better financial position than Wife to pay\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  The court noted &quot;[a]fter paying $1000.00 per\r\n  month alimony, the net cost to the Husband will be only $747.00 per month and\r\n  the Wife, after realizing the taxable alimony award will realize only $820.00\r\n  per month.Â  The Husband will continue to have more disposable income even after\r\n  the payment of alimony.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the family court ordered\r\n  Husband to contribute $5,000 to Wife's attorney's fees at a rate of $250 per\r\n  month.\r\nHusband\r\n  filed a motion for reconsideration. Â The family court denied the motion finding\r\n  the order contained sufficient findings to support alimony, equitable division,\r\n  and attorney's fees and also properly valued the vehicles.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n&quot;On appeal from a family court order, this [c]ourt has\r\n  authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  E.D.M. v.

Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 628, 216 S.E.2d\r\n  541, 543 (1975); see also Patel v.

Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500,\r\n  602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004). Â \r\nThe family court should consider the following factors in awarding\r\n  alimony: \r\n\r\n\t(1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of\r\n  the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history\r\n  and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during\r\n  the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties;\r\n  (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and\r\n  nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital\r\n  misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations;\r\n  as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nDavis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 79-80, 641 S.E.2d 446,\r\n  454&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008)).Â  &quot;The court is required to consider all\r\n  relevant factors in determining alimony.&quot;Â  Id. at 80, 641 S.E.2d at\r\n  454.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has held &quot;[t]hree important factors\r\n  in awarding periodic alimony are (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the\r\n  overall financial situation of the parties, especially the ability of the\r\n  supporting spouse to pay; and (3) whether either spouse was more at fault than\r\n  the other.&quot;Â  Patel, 359 S.C. at 529, 599 S.E.2d at 121.Â  In\r\n  determining whether to award alimony and what amount and type of alimony to\r\n  award, &quot;[n]o one factor is dispositive.&quot;Â  Pirri v.

Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 171, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977).Â  Rule 26(a),\r\n  SCRFC, provides that &quot;[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication\r\n  in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law to support the courtâ€™s decision.&quot;Â  See also Griffith\r\n    v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (holding the family court must make specific findings of fact on the record for\r\n  each of the required factors to be considered in making its decisions).Â  \r\nHusband asserts the family court did not consider (1) marital\r\n  misconduct and fault but noted &quot;Husband gave no reason for leaving\r\n  home&quot;; (2) the emotional condition of each spouse; (3) Husband's\r\n  educational background, employment history, and earning potential; and (4)\r\n  whether either spouse had a prior support obligation.Â  The family court is only\r\n  required to consider relevant factors.Â  Husband does not point to any\r\n  misconduct or fault on Wife's part.Â  Further, although Husband and Wife had two\r\n  children together during their first marriage, both were emancipated at the\r\n  time of the family court's hearing.Â  Father does not provide any support\r\n  obligations the family court failed to consider.Â  Additionally, the family\r\n  court found both parties to be in &quot;good health&quot; and did not limit\r\n  that finding to only physical health.Â  Once again, Husband does not bring to\r\n  our attention any emotional health issues the family court failed to take into\r\n  account.Â  While Husband filed a motion for reconsideration, he did not mention\r\n  which of the factors the family court failed to consider, simply that the order\r\n  did &quot;not set out specific finding of fact and conclusion of law as it\r\n  relates to awarded alimony and equitable division of property.&quot;Â  Although\r\n  the family court did not specify which findings corresponded with each\r\n  statutory factor, it does appear the family court considered all of the\r\n  relevant factors.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Husband's contention the family court must make its equitable\r\n  distribution before awarding alimony is not preserved for our review.Â  In order\r\n  for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina\r\n    Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007).Â  Husband did\r\n  not object when the family court made its ruling from the bench on alimony nor\r\n  did he file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion making this argument once the family\r\n  court issued its order.Â  Accordingly, we find Husband's argument that the\r\n  family court improperly awarded alimony before making the equitable\r\n  distribution is unpreserved.Â  Because the family court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in awarding alimony, we affirm the award.\r\nII.&nbsp; EQUITABLE\r\n  DISTRIBUTION\r\nHusband argues the family court abused its discretion in making\r\n  the equitable distribution when it assigned zero value to two automobiles Wife\r\n  testified were worth a combined value of $24,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nMarital property includes all real and personal property the\r\n  parties acquired during the marriage and owned as of the date of filing or\r\n  commencement of marital litigation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  &quot;The doctrine of equitable distribution is based on a recognition that\r\n  marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership.&quot;Â  Mallett v.\r\n    Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The\r\n  ultimate goal of apportionment is to divide the marital estate, as a whole, in\r\n  a manner that fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to the economic\r\n  partnership and also the effect on each of the parties of ending that\r\n  partnership.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 298, 372 S.E.2d 107, 112\r\n  (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThe division of marital property is within the family court's\r\n  discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion. Â Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361\r\n  (2005).Â  The appellate court looks to the overall fairness of the\r\n  apportionment.Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  If the end result is equitable, the fact that the appellate\r\n  court would have arrived at a different apportionment is irrelevant.Â  Id. Â &quot;For purposes of equitable distribution, 'marital debt' is debt incurred\r\n  for the joint benefit of the parties regardless of whether the parties are\r\n  legally jointly liable for the debt or whether one party is legally\r\n  individually liable.&quot;Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436-37, 429\r\n  S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  &quot;The same rules of fairness and equity\r\n  that apply to the equitable distribution of marital property also apply to the\r\n  equitable division of marital debts.&quot;Â  Thomson v. Thomson, 377 S.C.\r\n  613, 624, 661 S.E.2d 130, 136 (Ct. App. 2008). Â &quot;In the absence of contrary evidence, the court\r\n  should accept the value the parties assign to a marital asset.&quot; Â Pirri, 369\r\n  S.C. at 264, 631 S.E.2d at 283 (quoting Noll v. Noll, 297\r\n  S.C. 190, 194, 375 S.E.2d 338, 340-41 (Ct. App. 1988)). Â &quot;A family court may accept the\r\n  valuation of one party over another, and the court's valuation of marital\r\n  property will be affirmed if\r\n  it is within the range of evidence presented.&quot; Â Abercrombie v.\r\n    Abercrombie, 372 S.C. 643, 647, 643 S.E.2d 697, 699 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nExamining the overall distribution of property, the end result is\r\n  fair.Â  The parties did not have significant assets and had some debt.Â  Both\r\n  parties contributed to the marital estate; Husband through his income from\r\n  employment and Wife through both her income and her assumption of duties as a\r\n  traditional homemaker.Â  Husband's main contention is that the family court gave\r\n  the Maxima and the Forerunner both zero values, although Wife gave them a value\r\n  of $15,000 and $9,000, respectively.Â  However, Wife also testified both of the\r\n  vehicles had debt equal to their value.Â  Husband provided no testimony or\r\n  evidence the vehicles' values were not as Wife provided.Â  Because the family\r\n  court's valuation of the vehicles was equal to Wife's valuation, the family\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion.Â  Further, even though Wife received assets\r\n  to make up the difference, she actually received more debt than Husband.Â \r\n  Because the overall distribution appears fair, we affirm the family court's equitable\r\n  distribution.\r\nIII.&nbsp; ATTORNEY'S\r\n  FEES\r\nHusband argues the family court abused its discretion in awarding\r\n  attorney's fees because it failed to properly consider and weigh the statutory\r\n  factors.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has discretion in deciding whether to award\r\n  attorney's fees, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d\r\n  741, 748 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled\r\n  by an error of law or is based on factual findings lacking evidentiary\r\n  support.Â  Degenhart, 360 S.C. at 500, 602 S.E.2d at 97.Â  In deciding\r\n  whether to award attorney's fees, the family court should consider: (1) each\r\n  party's ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained\r\n  by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) the\r\n  effect of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  Patel, 359 S.C.\r\n  at 533, 599 S.E.2d at 123.Â  In determining reasonable attorney's fees, the six\r\n  factors the family court should consider are: &quot;(1) the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3)\r\n  professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5)\r\n  beneficial results obtained; [and] (6) customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.&quot;Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nHusband argues the family court failed to consider the nature,\r\n  extent, and difficulty of the case or the time necessarily devoted to the\r\n  case.Â  However, the family court referenced Wife's attorney's affidavit and\r\n  also the fact that the attorney would also be preparing the QDRO in addition to\r\n  the time the affidavit took into account.Â  Further, Husband did not object to\r\n  the affidavit or cross-examine counsel on it.Â  We believe the family court considered\r\n  the applicable factors as evidenced by the record and its reference to Glasscock.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the award of attorney's\r\n  fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe determination of alimony, equitable distribution, and\r\n  attorney's fees are all left to the family court's discretion.Â  Although the\r\n  family court did not specifically list all of the factors for each\r\n  determination, the order indicates it considered all the relevant factors.Â \r\n  Further, the overall equitable distribution is fair.Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4566","title":"Gause v.

Hunt (Father).Â \r\n  During the stop, a second car driven by Nathan Smithers, hit and injured Gause.Â \r\n  Almost three years later, on November 2, 2006, Gause filed a lawsuit against\r\n  Father as the driver of the car, alleging negligence.[1]Â  Father was\r\n  served on November 20, 2006, after the statute of limitations had expired, but\r\n  within the 120 days after filing provided for in Rule 3(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  Father answered\r\n  claiming he was not the driver of the car involved in the accident.Â  \r\nRealizing\r\n  his error in identifying the driver, Gause filed an amended complaint on\r\n  December 19, 2006, naming Son as another defendant based on his negligence in\r\n  driving the car, and adding causes of action against Father for negligent\r\n  entrustment and under the family purpose doctrine.Â  Son was served with the\r\n  amended complaint on January 25, 2007. Â Son moved to dismiss the claims against\r\n  him alleging he had been added as a party after the statute of limitations had\r\n  run.Â  Gause contended he was merely substituting Son as the real driver\r\n  pursuant to Rule 15(c), SCRCP, so the amended complaint should relate back to\r\n  the filing of the original complaint.Â  The circuit court determined Son was\r\n  being added as a party instead of substituted, and thus, Rule 15(c) did not\r\n  save the claims against Son.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard of review\r\n&quot;If, on a motion for\r\n  judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and\r\n  not excluded by the [c]ourt, the motion shall be treated as one for summary\r\n  judgment . . . .&quot;Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr,\r\n  377 S.C. 217, 225, 659 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;When\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same\r\n  standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary\r\n  judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\r\n  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nGause\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in analyzing the amended complaint as an\r\n  attempted addition of a party rather than as the change of a party for purposes\r\n  of Rule 15(c), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRule\r\n  15(c) provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading\r\n  arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to\r\n  be set forth in the original pleadings, the amendment relates back to the date\r\n  of the original pleading.\r\n\t\tAn amendment changing the party\r\n  against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is\r\n  satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action\r\n  against him the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such\r\n  notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in\r\n  maintaining his defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that,\r\n  but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would\r\n  have been brought against him.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJackson\r\n  v. Doe,\r\n  342 S.C. 552, 537 S.E.2d 567 (Ct. App. 2000), discussed the application of Rule\r\n  15(c) at length.Â  In that case, Jackson amended her complaint after the statute\r\n  of limitations had expired in a John Doe hit and run action.Â  Id. at\r\n  554, 537 S.E.2d at 568.Â  Jackson added a named party as the defendant but did\r\n  not dismiss John Doe as a defendant.Â  Id.Â  The majority of the court\r\n  concluded the second paragraph of Rule 15(c) only applied to a substitution or\r\n  change in party, not the addition of a defendant.Â  Id. at 558, 537 S.E.2d\r\n  at 570.Â  (&quot;The language of Rule 15(c) clearly speaks to a change in\r\n  party, not the addition of a defendant to an already existing\r\n  defendant.Â  In our view, the addition of a party is not the same as a\r\n  substitution or change of the party.&quot;).[2]Â  Cline v. J.E. Faulkner Holmes, Inc., more recently followed this view.Â  359\r\n  S.C. 367, 371 n.2, 597 S.E.2d 27, 29 n.2 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding Rule 15(c)\r\n  did not allow plaintiff to add a party to a negligence action after termination\r\n  of statute of limitations when plaintiff discovered additional party was an\r\n  independent contractor and not employee of original defendant).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Gause named Son as a defendant with respect to the direct negligence\r\n  claims.Â  However, he also kept Father in the case.Â  We conclude this amounted\r\n  to the addition of a defendant, the action Jackson sought to proscribe\r\n  in keeping with the plain language of Rule 15(c).Â  We are mindful this produces\r\n  a harsh result, although Gause's claims against Father remain viable.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, we are compelled to affirm the findings of the circuit court.\r\nBecause\r\n  the addition of a party is not contemplated by Rule 15(c), we need not address\r\n  whether Son's being made a defendant was otherwise proper under that Rule.[3]Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716,\r\n  723 (2000) (&quot;The appellate court may find it unnecessary to discuss\r\n  respondent's additional sustaining grounds when its affirmance is grounded in\r\n  an issue addressed by the lower court.&quot;).\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nhuff and Williams, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The portion of\r\n  the accident report identifying the driver was blank, because Son was taken to\r\n  the hospital before the report was completed.Â  After seeing Father's name as\r\n  the owner of the vehicle, Gause proceeded in filing his suit believing Edward\r\n  W. Hunt was both the owner and driver of the vehicle.\r\n[2] Chief Judge\r\n  Hearn dissented in Jackson, reasoning the named defendant was not an\r\n  additional party because Jackson alleged John Doe and the named defendant were\r\n  the same person.Â  342\r\n  S.C. at 558, 537 S.E.2d at 571 (Hearn, C.J., dissenting). Â That reasoning\r\n  does not apply to the facts of this case.\r\n[3] At oral\r\n  argument, Son contended he was not properly substituted for Father because he\r\n  was not necessarily on notice of Gause's action within the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  Gause argues Son had proper notice of the action because he was\r\n  served with the amended complaint within the statute of limitations plus 120\r\n  days after filing of the original complaint.Â  See Rule 3(a)(2), SCRCP\r\n  (stating a civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed\r\n  and served with the statute of limitations, or if not served with the statute\r\n  of limitations, the summons and complaint are actually served within 120 days\r\n  after filing).Â  The circuit court did not rule on this issue.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4567","title":"Fiddie v.

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY,\r\n  J.:Â  In this domestic action, Walter Fiddie (Husband) appeals\r\n    the family court's refusal to terminate alimony and its order increasing\r\n    alimony to Diane Fiddie (Wife).Â  Husband argues the family court misapplied\r\n    certain equitable maxims.Â  Additionally, Husband argues the family court erred\r\n    in awarding attorney's fees and costs to Wife and failing to award attorney's\r\n    fees and costs to him.Â Â  Finally, Husband argues the family court erred in\r\n    finding Wife a credible witness and in finding the errors he made in his\r\n    financial declarations were more than &quot;simple errors.&quot;Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife\r\n  were married on June 6, 1966, and had two children.Â  After twenty-seven years\r\n  of marriage, in 1994, the parties were divorced on the ground of one year's\r\n  continuous separation.Â  In its divorce order, the family court approved an agreement entered into by Husband\r\n  and Wife.Â  Under the terms of their agreement, Husband was obligated to pay\r\n  Wife $250 per month in permanent alimony until her death or remarriage.Â  A\r\n  provision in their agreement provided Wife's alimony would increase to $400\r\n  when their youngest child &quot;complet[ed] college of highest education he\r\n  desire[d].&quot;Â Â Â  Additionally, pursuant to their agreement, Husband agreed\r\n  to pay Wife &quot;one half of any retirement, up to the date the parties are\r\n  divorced, as it becomes available.&quot;Â  In 2002, the family court increased\r\n  Husband's monthly alimony to $675 after Wife petitioned the family court for an\r\n  increase.Â  \r\nOn July 19, 2005, Husband petitioned the family court to terminate\r\n  his alimony obligation based on Wife's continued cohabitation with another man,\r\n  Ronald Robinson.Â  Additionally, Husband requested reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  and costs.Â  Subsequently, Husband filed\r\n  an amended complaint on January 18, 2006, essentially making the same allegations.Â \r\n  Wife answered Husband's complaint, counterclaimed for an increase in alimony,\r\n  and also sought attorney's fees and costs.Â  Â Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial evidence demonstrated Wife could not afford the home she purchased and\r\n  has had to live with friends and relatives.Â Â Â  At one time she lived in a\r\n  substandard house with inadequate plumbing and only a partial roof.Â  She had\r\n  financial troubles, and on occasion did not have enough money for food.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Wife's health was deteriorating, and she could not afford health insurance or\r\n  prescription medication.Â  Because of her health problems, she appeared unable\r\n  to work.Â  \r\nAfter striking up a friendship with Ronald Robinson, Wife moved in\r\n  with him in his North Myrtle Beach apartment from August 2004 until October\r\n  2005 &quot;as a roommate.&quot;Â  While living with him, Wife helped Robinson\r\n  with his business, and he provided her financial support.Â  Both insisted they\r\n  were not engaged in a &quot;romantic relationship,&quot; though they admitted\r\n  having consensual sex approximately three times.Â  Additionally, Wife maintains\r\n  she would spend time with a friend at least twice a month and with her sister\r\n  once a month so that she was not staying with Robinson on a full-time basis.Â \r\n  When the present action began, Wife was living in an apartment in Charleston,\r\n  and Robinson was helping pay her rent.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court refused to terminate Husband's alimony obligation based on his\r\n  continued cohabitation allegation.Â  The family court found the evidence\r\n  presented did not prove Wife lived with Robinson for ninety consecutive days or\r\n  that Robinson and Wife were involved in a romantic relationship.Â  After finding\r\n  a substantial change in Husband and Wife's circumstances, the family court\r\n  increased Husband's alimony obligation to $1,200 per month.Â  Finally, the court\r\n  directed Husband pay $10,000 of Wife's attorney's fees and costs.Â  Husband\r\n  filed a motion to alter or amend judgment which the family court denied.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the\r\n  family court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors of law and find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Epperly\r\n    v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1994).Â  Although this\r\n  court may find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial court, who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Marquez v.\r\n    Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2008).Â  However,\r\n  â€œ[q]uestions concerning alimony rest with the sound discretion of the [family]\r\n  court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Termination based on\r\n  Cohabitation\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to\r\n  terminate alimony based on Wife's cohabitation with another man.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Husband contends Wife's relationship triggered both the common law grounds for\r\n  terminating alimony as well as the statutory grounds.Â  We affirm the family\r\n  court's determination that Wife did not meet the statutory grounds for\r\n  termination of alimony under the continued cohabitation statute and its\r\n  determination that Wife's living arrangement with Robinson was not tantamount\r\n  to marriage.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Continued Cohabitation\r\n  Statute\r\nUnder\r\n  section 20-3-150 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008), a supporting spouse's\r\n  permanent alimony and support obligations will terminate &quot;upon the\r\n  remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse. . . .&quot;Â  Section\r\n  20-3-150 defines &quot;continued cohabitation&quot; to mean &quot;the supported\r\n  spouse resides with another person in a romantic relationship for a period of\r\n  ninety or more consecutive days.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the continued cohabitation\r\n  statute provides:Â  &quot;The court may determine that a continued cohabitation\r\n  exists if there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with another\r\n  person in a romantic relationship for periods of less than ninety days and the\r\n  two periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement.&quot;Â \r\n  Recently, our supreme court found &quot;resides with,&quot; under the statute\r\n  requires &quot;the supported spouse live under the same roof as the person with\r\n  whom they are romantically involved for at least ninety consecutive days.&quot;Â  Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 89, 650 S.E.2d 465, 472 (2007); see\r\n    also Semken v. Semken, 379 S.C. 71, 74, 664 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).\r\nTherefore,\r\n  the threshold question before us is whether Wife lived under the same roof as Robinson\r\n  for at least ninety consecutive days in a romantic relationship.Â  Here, the\r\n  family court found uncontroverted evidence demonstrated Wife stayed with at\r\n  least three people other than Robinson every month in question.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the family court found Husband failed to prove Wife and Robinson resided\r\n  together in a romantic relationship for ninety or more consecutive days.Â  Under\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence, the family court found evidence presented did\r\n  not meet the statutory guidelines for termination of Husband's alimony.Â  \r\nRegarding whether\r\n  Wife resided with Robinson for ninety consecutive days, we defer to the family\r\n  court's judgment.Â  Testimony in the record demonstrates Wife did not want to stay\r\n  with Robinson on a full-time basis and that she hated wearing out her welcome\r\n  anywhere she went.Â  Additionally, testimony from Wife's sister and friend\r\n  corroborated Wife's testimony that she stayed with them for several days each\r\n  month.Â  Accordingly, because this issue seems to be a credibility\r\n  determination, we give deference to the family court which heard the testimony\r\n  and made a credibility determination.[1]Â  See Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742\r\n  (2008).Â  We also find Wife did not stay with her sister and friend in an\r\n  attempt to circumvent the continued cohabitation statute because evidence\r\n  demonstrates she was unaware of the statute until the litigation began and thus\r\n  the potential consequences of cohabitating with another.Â  \r\nB.Â  Tantamount\r\n  to Marriage\r\nHusband maintains\r\n  the family court erred in failing to terminate his alimony because Wife's\r\n  relationship with Robinson was tantamount to marriage.Â  We disagree and find\r\n  the cases Husband relies on distinguishable from the present case.Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  relies on Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001), where this court found ex-Wife's relationship tantamount to marriage\r\n  after she lived with another man for twelve years, moved to Florida with him,\r\n  purchased a home with him, and had the home titled in both their names, among\r\n  other factors.Â  Unlike Bryson, where ex-wife's relationship with another\r\n  man was permanent in nature, here, Wife resided with Robinson as a temporary\r\n  solution to her homelessness.Â  From the record, it appears both understood the\r\n  temporary nature of her residence with him.Â  We also believe the present case\r\n  is different from Jeanes v. Jeanes, 255 S.C. 161, 177 S.E.2d 537 (1970),\r\n  where the supreme court found the ex-Wife and paramour entered into a common\r\n  law marriage because the couple resided together and held themselves out to be\r\n  husband and wife.Â  Here, we believe Wife and Robinson held themselves out to be\r\n  friends rather than husband and wife.Â  Accordingly, due to the temporary nature\r\n  of Wife and Robinson's living arrangement as well as their holding themselves\r\n  out as friends, we find the family court did not err in refusing to terminate his\r\n  alimony obligation based on Husband's argument that Wife's relationship with\r\n  Robinson was tantamount to marriage.Â  \r\nII.Â  Increase in\r\n  Alimony/Changed Circumstances \r\nHusband contends\r\n  the family court erred in finding a change of circumstances warranted an\r\n  increase in Wife's alimony. Â Husband admits his\r\n  financial situation has improved since the parties' divorce; however, he\r\n  maintains his increase in income alone should not be the basis for an alimony\r\n  increase.Â  We disagree.\r\nUpon a change in circumstances, the family court may modify\r\n  an alimony obligation.Â  See Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516,\r\n  586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  To justify modification or termination of\r\n  an alimony award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.\r\n  Â Id. at 519, 586 S.E.2d at 140. Â Moreover, the change in circumstances\r\n  must be unanticipated. Â Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 589, 594 S.E.2d\r\n  171, 174 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  &quot;The party seeking modification has the burden\r\n  to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the unforeseen change has\r\n  occurred.&quot;Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d 727,729\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n&quot;Many of the same considerations relevant to the initial\r\n  setting of an alimony award may be applied in the modification context as well,\r\n  including the parties' standard of living during the marriage, each party's\r\n  earning capacity, and the supporting spouse's ability to continue to support\r\n  the other spouse.[2]&quot; Â Miles, 355 S.C. at 519, 586 S.E.2d at 140. Â Here, the family court based this modification partly on Husband's improved\r\n  financial condition.Â  The family court noted Husband was earning $100,000 per\r\n  year over his retirement annuity, while he was earning only $38,000 per year\r\n  without retirement income when the parties last appeared before the court in\r\n  2002.Â  At the time of this proceeding, Husband's income exceeded his expenses by\r\n  more than $4,000.Â  Further, the family court found Husband intentionally filed\r\n  false financial declarations with the court, and but for Wife's counsel's\r\n  cross-examination, his financials would have misled the court.Â  \r\nIn addition to\r\n  noting Husband's improved change of circumstances, the family court also\r\n  considered Wife's current circumstances.Â  The family court noted Wife is\r\n  unemployed and suffers from multiple ailments including fibromyalgia, severe\r\n  osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, migraine headaches, hypertension, and severe\r\n  depression &quot;such that she is unable to work.&quot;Â  Additionally, the\r\n  family court noted Wife has no health insurance to aid her in obtaining\r\n  prescriptions and doctor's visits.Â  Finally, the family court found Wife's\r\n  insufficient income and declining health eventually led to homelessness.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the family court increased Wife's alimony to $1,200 per month.Â  \r\nWe find Wife met her burden of proving an unforeseen\r\n  change in circumstances occurred based on her declining health, her homelessness,\r\n  and her inability to work.Â  Wife's changes in her health and financial\r\n  conditions are significant.Â  Further, though normal increases in income may not\r\n  be enough to warrant an increase in alimony, here, Husband's change in financial\r\n  situation is material enough to warrant an increase in his alimony obligation\r\n  considering he is making more than double his income from 2002.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the family court did not abuse its discretion by increasing alimony based on\r\n  Husband's improved financial situation together with Wife's diminished standard\r\n  of living.Â  Therefore, we affirm the family court's decision to increase\r\n  Husband's alimony obligation.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Other Issues\r\nHusband's other\r\n  issues on appeal are abandoned because he cited no authority and makes conclusory assertions.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 378 S.C. 502, 510, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding an issue is deemed abandoned and will not be\r\n  considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by\r\n  authority); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 99, 594 S.E.2d 485,\r\n  496 (Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;Numerous cases have held that where an issue is not\r\n  argued within the body of the brief but is only a short conclusory statement,\r\n  it is abandoned on appeal.&quot;).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court did not err in refusing to terminate Wife's alimony under\r\n  the continued cohabitation statute because evidence did not demonstrate Wife\r\n  stayed with Robinson for ninety consecutive days.Â  This issue, in large part, came down to a credibility\r\n  determination, and we gave deference to the family court which heard the\r\n  testimony.Â  We also do not find Wife's relationship with Robinson was\r\n  tantamount to marriage.Â  Additionally, we affirm the family court's decision to\r\n  increase Husband's alimony obligation based on unforeseen changes in both Wife\r\n  and Husband's circumstances.Â  All other issues raised to this court are\r\n  abandoned on appeal.Â  The decision of the family court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Because we find Wife did not stay with Robinson on a\r\n  full-time basis, we decline to comment on whether she and Robinson were in a\r\n  &quot;romantic relationship.&quot;Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-150\r\n  (requiring both residence with another for ninety consecutive days and a\r\n  romantic relationship for a continued cohabitation finding).\r\n[2] Per statute, the complete list of factors the family\r\n  court can consider in setting alimony include: (1) duration of the marriage;\r\n  (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of\r\n  the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5)\r\n  standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably\r\n  anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated\r\n  expenses and needs of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the\r\n  parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax\r\n  consequences; and (12) prior support obligations; as well as other factors the\r\n  court considers relevant.

Â We affirm in part, reverse in\r\n  part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife were married on July 18, 1996, and after nine years of marriage, the\r\n  couple separated. Husband and Wife had no children together. Subsequently,\r\n  Wife filed for divorce on May 2, 2006, on the ground of adultery.Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife began their relationship in North Carolina in 1992. Â In 1994, the\r\n  parties moved their mobile home onto property owned by Husband's father located\r\n  on Highway 25 in Greenville County.Â  Husband and Wife lived in the\r\n  mobile home with Wife's minor son and Husband's minor son and daughter. Husband's\r\n  father died in 1995, and devised a life estate in both a seventeen acre tract\r\n  and a thirty-two acre tract in Greenville County to Husband. Â In 1995,\r\n  Husband and Wife began operating a produce stand on the seventeen acre tract of\r\n  land. In 1998, Husband and Wife built a new stand to house the produce\r\n  business. \r\nOn\r\n  July 2, 2007, the family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery\r\n  and ordered to Husband pay Wife $500 in monthly alimony, and $500 in monthly\r\n  minimum wage income for twenty-five years.Â  The family court also found Wife\r\n  was entitled to a one-fourth interest in the leasehold income from a cellular\r\n  tower and a one-fourth interest in a Certificate of Deposit with a current\r\n  value of $20,000. Additionally, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $2,000\r\n  in attorneys' fees and costs. Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Arnal v. Arnal,\r\n  363 S.C. 268, 280, 609 S.E.2d 821, 827 (Ct. App. 2005). Â However, &quot;[q]uestions\r\n  concerning alimony rest with the sound discretion of the [family] court, whose\r\n  conclusions will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  &quot;The [family] court abuses its discretion when\r\n  factual findings are without evidentiary support or a ruling is based upon an\r\n  error of law.&quot; Â Smith v. Doe, 366 S.C. 469, 474, 623 S.E.2d 370,\r\n  372 (2005).Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  the family court has the discretion to determine whether a witness is qualified\r\n  as an expert, and whether his opinion is admissible on a fact in issue. Â Altman\r\n    v. Griffith,&nbsp;372 S.C. 388, 400, 642 S.E.2d 619, 625&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007).\r\n  Â On appeal, the family court's ruling to exclude or admit expert testimony will\r\n  not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. Id.Â  &quot;Defects in an expert witness' education and experience\r\n  go to the weight, not the admissibility, of the expert's testimony.&quot;Â  Peterson\r\n    v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI. Transmutation of produce\r\nstand \r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding Wife an interest in Husband's life\r\n  estate in the produce stand.Â  We disagree. \r\nHusband\r\n  argues Wife's use of nonmarital property in support of the marriage alone is\r\n  insufficient to establish transmutation.Â  He relies on Peterkin v. Peterkin,\r\n  where the court held mere use of income derived from nonmarital property in\r\n  support of the marriage does not transmute it into marital property. 293 S.C.\r\n  311, 313, 360 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1987).Â  Moreover, this court has ruled: &quot;The\r\n  mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without some additional\r\n  evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient\r\n  to establish transmutation.&quot;Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289,\r\n  295-96, 372 S.E.2d 107, 111 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\n&quot;Transmutation\r\n  is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.&quot;Â  Jenkins\r\n    v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;The\r\n  spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective evidence showing that,\r\n  during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the common\r\n  property of the marriage.&quot; Â Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at\r\n  110-11. &quot;Such evidence may include placing the property in joint names,\r\n  transferring the property to the other spouse as a gift, using the property\r\n  exclusively for marital purposes, commingling the property with marital\r\n  property, using marital funds to build equity in the property, or exchanging\r\n  the property for marital property.&quot; Id.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  property acquired by either party by inheritance, devise, bequest or gift from\r\n  a party other than the spouse is nonmarital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1)\r\n  (Supp. 2008). Â &quot;[N]onmarital property may be transmuted into marital\r\n  property if: (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be\r\n  untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in\r\n  support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by\r\n  the parties to make it marital property.&quot; Jenkins, 345 S.C. at 98,\r\n  545 S.E.2d at 537. \r\nHere,\r\n  the family court found (1) the jointly owned Certificate of Deposit ($20,000.00),\r\n  (2) the income from the cellular tower lease, and (3) the life estate in the\r\n  produce business were all transmuted to marital property &quot;by their title\r\n  and use in support of the marriage.&quot; Although there is no evidence the\r\n  disputed property was ever jointly titled, evidence supports the family court's\r\n  determination that the property was used by the parties in support of the\r\n  marriage. \r\nProfits\r\n  from the produce stand along with rental income from the cellular tower\r\n  provided Husband and Wife their main sources of income.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  parties intended to treat the produce stand as property of the marriage and used\r\n  the income from the produce stand to provide for their family.Â  In turn, the\r\n  parties used marital funds to build equity in the produce stand.Â  Wife\r\n  testified she and Husband used income generated by the produce stand to\r\n  construct the new stand.Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  admits the parties' main source of income came from the produce stand and rental\r\n  income from the cellular tower. Â Husband testified the parties &quot;lived\r\n  off&quot; the income generated by the produce stand. Â Wife worked seven\r\n  days a week during the produce stand's thirty-two week selling season. Her\r\n  responsibilities included running the cash register, purchasing inventory, and\r\n  unloading produce. Wife testified she ran the daily operations of the\r\n  produce stand with the help of several workers until two years before the parties\r\n  separated, when she operated the business on her own. Wife did not receive any\r\n  wages for her work at the produce stand. Â Furthermore, the building permits\r\n  obtained for the construction of the produce stand named both Husband and Wife\r\n  as owners of the property.Â  Â \r\nBecause\r\n  the parties utilized the produce stand in support of their marriage and demonstrated\r\n  their intent to treat it as marital property, we find the family court did not\r\n  err in determining the produce stand was transmuted into marital property, and\r\n  we affirm its finding.Â  \r\nII. Expert testimony as to business valuation of the produce stand\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in qualifying Wife's\r\n  expert witness.Â  We disagree.[1]Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  the family court has the discretion to determine whether a witness has\r\n  qualified as an expert, and whether his opinion is admissible on a fact in\r\n  issue. Â Altman v. Griffith,&nbsp;372 S.C. 388, 400, 642 S.E.2d 619,\r\n  625&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007).Â  Pursuant to Rule 702, SCRE: &quot;If scientific,\r\n  technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\r\n  understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as\r\n  an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify\r\n  thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&quot; Â On appeal, the family\r\n  court's ruling to exclude or admit expert testimony will not be disturbed\r\n  absent a clear abuse of discretion. Â Altman, 372 S.C. at 400, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  at 625. Â &quot;Defects in an expert witness' education\r\n  and experience go to the weight, not the admissibility, of the expert's\r\n  testimony.&quot;Â  Peterson v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391,\r\n  399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005).\r\nIn the present case, Husband objected to the expert's\r\n  testimony based on surprise and lack of qualification as an expert. Husband\r\n  argued Wife failed to disclose that expert testimony would be offered as to the\r\n  valuation of the produce stand. Â The family court overruled the failure to\r\n  disclose objection because &quot;any surprise . . . should have been overcome\r\n  from the standpoint that the value of this produce stand is really pivotal to\r\n  the litigation to the [family] [c]ourt.&quot; Â Thereafter the family\r\n  court qualified Wife's expert, Ken Walker, a certified real estate appraiser, concerning\r\n  the valuation of the business. \r\nWalker testified he began appraising real estate in\r\n  the 1970s and has worked in real estate since that time. Â He is\r\n  certified in South Carolina as a real estate appraiser and has taken ninety\r\n  hours of classes regarding valuations of a life estate. Walker testified\r\n  he has performed fifty to one hundred real estate appraisals per year for the\r\n  last twenty to twenty-five years and has testified in numerous court\r\n  proceedings. Walker acknowledged he had never testified in court as to the\r\n  value of a life estate and had never valued a produce stand business. However, he\r\n  had valued buildings or structures like the produce stand many times. \r\nThe family court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying\r\n  Walker as an expert based on his specialized\r\n  knowledge in valuing real estate.Â  Further, Walker was\r\n  thoroughly questioned regarding his credentials and education.Â  Husband's basis\r\n  for his objection to Walker's qualifications was that Walker had never\r\n  testified as to the value of a life estate and had never valued a produce stand.Â \r\n  However, these assertions would merely go the weight of his testimony and not\r\n  its admissibility.Â  See Peterson, 365 S.C. at 399, 618 S.E.2d at 907\r\n  (&quot;[D]efects in an expert witness' education and experience go to the\r\n  weight, not the admissibility, of the expert's testimony.&quot;).Â  Therefore, we\r\n  see no error in the family court's qualification of Walker\r\n  as an expert.Â  \r\nIII. Equitable division of minimum\r\nwage income \r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court's award of $500 per month in minimum wage income for\r\n  twenty-five years to Wife constitutes future support and is improper as part of\r\n  the equitable division of the marital estate.Â  We believe Wife is entitled to a\r\n  portion of the produce stand's present value rather than $500 in monthly income.Â \r\n  Therefore, we reverse and remand on this issue.Â  \r\nIn its final order, the family court found Wife was\r\n  entitled to $500 per month for twenty-five years for her services and labor at\r\n  the parties' produce stand. Â The order further provided:\r\n\r\n  (1) Alternatively,\r\n    [Wife] is entitled to continue to use the property as a produce stand or\r\n    comparable business in partnership with [Husband] on an equal basis.\r\n  (2)If\r\n    [Husband] should choose not to be in partnership with the [Wife], [Wife] may\r\n    run it herself or develop partnership with third party(ies) with silent\r\n    financing to the said business.Â  [Wife] shall recoup all upfront costs and\r\n    divide net proceeds one-fourth (1/4) with [Husband] on an annual basis.\r\n    [Husband] shall be entitled to full on-going disclosure without interference in\r\n    [Wife's] daily operation.Â  \r\n\r\nWe see several problems with\r\n  the family court's order.Â  The\r\n  family court does not indicate its basis for awarding Wife $500 in monthly minimum\r\n  wage income. Furthermore, it is unclear from the family court's order whether\r\n  or not Wife would have to work at the produce stand in order to receive the\r\n  monthly $500.Â  The current ruling of the family court requires continued\r\n  monitoring of the produce stand as a business, and it remains unclear whether\r\n  the produce stand will continue to be profitable.Â  \r\nInstead, we believe the family court should value\r\n  Wife's interest in the produce stand rather than awarding her a monthly minimum\r\n  wage income.Â  This approach eliminates future conflicts between the parties and\r\n  uncertainties that could arise in running a business.Â  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  the family court's award of $500 in monthly minimum wage income and remand the\r\n  issue to the family court for a valuation.Â  On remand, we find both parties\r\n  should have an opportunity to put forth evidence, either in the form of tax\r\n  returns or expert testimony, to show the produce stand's value.Â  Once the\r\n  family court assigns value to the property, in its discretion, the family court\r\n  shall award Wife an appropriate portion of the produce stand's net present\r\n  value as an equitable division award.\r\nIV.Permanent alimony\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court failed to consider the employment history and earning\r\n  potential of each spouse in awarding Wife $500 in alimony.Â  Based on our\r\n  decision to award Wife an interest in the produce stand, we remand the issue of\r\n  permanent alimony to the family court for reconsideration.Â  Josey v. Josey,\r\n  291 S.C. 26, 33, 351 S.E.2d 891, 895-96 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding the family\r\n  court may consider the amount received in equitable distribution when\r\n  determining an alimony award).Â  On remand, the family court should consider the\r\n  factors set forth in section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2008) in making an alimony determination.Â  Accordingly, without deciding\r\n  whether to award alimony or an alimony amount we remand this issue to the trial\r\n  court. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family court's finding that the produce\r\n  stand was transmuted into marital property, and its qualification of Wife's\r\n  expert witness.Â  Additionally, we remand the award of alimony to the family\r\n  court for reconsideration.Â  On the issue of monthly minimum wage income, we\r\n  reverse and remand.Â  On remand, the family court shall value the produce stand\r\n  and in its discretion, award Wife an appropriate portion of the produce stand's\r\n  net present value as an equitable division award.Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and PIEPER,\r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Based upon our disposition of this issue and the\r\n  following issue, we need not address Husband's argument the family court erred\r\nin accepting the expert's valuation of the parties' business.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4569","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren B.\r\n          Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.: Appellant\r\n  Alphonso Simmons (Simmons) claims the circuit court erred on several grounds at\r\n  his criminal trial for kidnapping, armed robbery, and grand larceny of a motor\r\n  vehicle, which resulted in prejudice to Simmons and warrants a new trial.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 19, 2004, at approximately 7:00 a.m., an armed robbery\r\n  occurred at the McDonald's on Decker Boulevard in Columbia, South Carolina.Â \r\n  The employees were held at gunpoint, robbed, and locked inside the restaurant's\r\n  cooler.Â  While inside the restaurant, the robber stole personal items from the\r\n  employees and approximately $1,300 from the restaurant's safe.Â  After\r\n  fleeing the McDonald's, the robber stole a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire from the\r\n  parking lot.Â  The robber then removed the tires, the custom rims, an amplifier,\r\n  and a custom speaker box, and he abandoned the car in a wooded area near the\r\n  location of the robbery.Â  \r\nSimmons was arrested in an unrelated home invasion in Kershaw\r\n  County on May 24, 2004, approximately one month after the McDonald's robbery.Â \r\n  The police impounded Simmons's vehicle, and the custom rims, speaker box, and\r\n  amplifier from his vehicle were subsequently identified as those stolen from\r\n  the Pontiac Sunfire.Â  Shortly after Simmons's arrest in Kershaw County, he was\r\n  transported to Richland County for questioning in connection with the\r\n  McDonald's robbery.\r\nBefore the police questioned Simmons at Richland County police\r\n  headquarters, Simmons was asked to give his palm print for identification\r\n  purposes. Â Chief David Wilson, deputy chief of investigations for Richland\r\n  County, testified that Simmons initially refused to give his palm print but\r\n  consented after he explained the purpose behind taking the print.[1] Â Â While his palm print was being\r\n  taken, Simmons indicated that he was hungry, so Chief Wilson requested a meal\r\n  for Simmons.Â  \r\nOnce Simmons gave his palm print, Chief Wilson escorted Simmons to\r\n  his office.Â  At that time, Chief Wilson read Simmons his Miranda[2] rights from a standard form.Â  Simmons\r\n  was not handcuffed or restrained in any way while in Chief Wilson's office.Â  Chief\r\n  Wilson then questioned Simmons on whether he understood his rights. Â Simmons\r\n  stated he understood them as he was &quot;familiar with the system.&quot;Â \r\n  Simmons did not sign a waiver of rights form, but Chief Wilson testified that\r\n  in his opinion, Simmons's actions demonstrated a knowing and voluntary waiver\r\n  of his rights.Â  Investigator Steven Faust, who was present when Chief\r\n  Wilson read Simmons his Miranda rights, corroborated Chief Wilson's\r\n  testimony.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, Simmons's meal arrived.Â  While eating his\r\n  meal, but before discussing the McDonald's robbery, Simmons requested that he\r\n  be allowed to call his father, mother, and brother.Â  Chief Wilson was unable to\r\n  contact Simmons's mother, but Simmons spoke with his father and brother over\r\n  the phone, who then came to police headquarters and spoke with Simmons for\r\n  approximately thirty minutes outside of the police's presence.Â  Chief Wilson\r\n  testified that he did not talk with Simmons specifically about the McDonald's\r\n  robbery until after Simmons met with his family, as Simmons stated he would\r\n  tell the police everything after meeting with his family.Â  \r\nAfter speaking with his father and brother, Simmons discussed the\r\n  robbery with Chief Wilson and Captain James Smith.Â  At some point, Captain\r\n  Smith asked whether Simmons had viewed the videotape from the McDonald's\r\n  robbery, at which time Simmons requested to view the videotape.Â  Before Simmons\r\n  made any admissions, Captain Smith told Simmons the quality of the surveillance\r\n  tape was &quot;pretty good.&quot;Â  While viewing a close-up frame of the\r\n  robber's face, Captain Smith testified that Simmons said, &quot;Those are\r\n  pretty good.&quot;Â  Captain Smith then asked Simmons where the clothing was\r\n  located that he was wearing in the video, and Simmons stated the clothing\r\n  should be in his car.Â  Chief Wilson also testified that Simmons identified\r\n  himself as the robber in the video.Â  Following this admission, Simmons confessed\r\n  to stealing the money from McDonald's but claimed it was much less than the\r\n  $1,300 allegedly stolen from the store's safe.Â  Simmons was not willing to\r\n  reduce his confession to writing.Â  Chief Wilson stated the interrogation lasted\r\n  approximately five hours, which did not include the time Simmons was in the\r\n  holding cell. \r\nThe police served warrants on Simmons for the McDonald's robbery\r\n  around 7:30 p.m. that evening, at which time Sergeant Barnes arrived to\r\n  transport Simmons back to the Kershaw County detention center and to deliver a\r\n  second meal to him.Â  En route to the detention center, Sergeant Barnes stated\r\n  that Simmons initiated conversation by asking whether Sergeant Barnes would be\r\n  taking him to jail.Â  Sergeant Barnes replied in the affirmative and stated that\r\n  it had been a long day.Â  Sergeant Barnes then testified that he told Simmons\r\n  the police were tired of chasing him and that while Simmons had given the\r\n  police a good chase, &quot;he messed up when he stole the rims and\r\n  stereo.&quot;Â  Sergeant Barnes also stated that in response to his statements,\r\n  Simmons nodded his head in agreement, smiled, and said, &quot;It was fun while\r\n  it lasted.&quot;Â  \r\nPrior to Simmons's arrest on May 24, 2004 in Kershaw County, Sergeant\r\n  Scott McDonald presented several McDonald's employees with photographic\r\n  line-ups in an attempt to identify the robber.Â  Simmons's photo was not in any\r\n  of the prior line-ups, and none of the witnesses made any positive\r\n  identifications in the prior line-ups.Â  The day Simmons was arrested in Kershaw\r\n  and became a suspect in the McDonald's robbery, Sergeant McDonald returned to\r\n  the McDonald's with a new photographic line-up containing Simmons's picture.Â  Simmons's\r\n  picture was the second photograph in a six-picture photo array.Â  Sergeant McDonald\r\n  separately presented the line-up to four employees with specific instructions\r\n  not to discuss the matter with anyone.Â  Two employees, L'Marshalett Moore and\r\n  Sophia Thomas, positively identified Simmons as the robber in the photographic\r\n  line-up and testified to the same at trial.Â  Both Ms. Thomas and Ms. Moore\r\n  testified unequivocally that they did not discuss their identifications with\r\n  anyone else, including each other.Â  Later that evening, based on the photographic\r\n  identifications, the recovered car rims, and videotape footage from the\r\n  McDonald's robbery, the Richland County police issued a warrant for Simmons's\r\n  arrest.Â  \r\nSimmons was subsequently tried and convicted by a Richland County\r\n  jury of eight counts of kidnapping, five counts of armed robbery, and one count\r\n  of grand larceny of a motor vehicle.Â  Simmons received a concurrent twenty-year\r\n  sentence on each kidnapping charge and a concurrent ten-year sentence on each\r\n  armed robbery charge as well as a concurrent ten-year sentence on the grand\r\n  larceny charge.Â  The latter charges of armed robbery and grand larceny were to\r\n  run concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the kidnapping charges, for a\r\n  total of thirty years confinement.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n(1) Did the circuit court's admission of limited testimony regarding\r\nthe Kershaw County incident violate Rules 404(b) and 403, SCRE? \r\n(2) Did the circuit court err in determining that Simmons's\r\nadmissions to the police while in custody were freely and voluntarily made?\r\n(3) Did the circuit court err in permitting two eyewitnesses to testify\r\n  in court that they positively identified Simmons in a photographic line-up and\r\n  a third eyewitness to testify that Simmons &quot;looked like&quot; the robber? Â Further,\r\n  was it reversible error for the circuit court to deny Simmons's motion for a\r\n  mistrial when the third witness once referred the robber as &quot;the\r\ndefendant&quot; in her testimony? \r\n(4) Did the circuit court err in permitting an investigating officer\r\n  to testify when the officer entered the courtroom during another witness's\r\ntestimony, despite the court's sequestration order?\r\n(5) Did the circuit court err in requiring Simmons to give a second\r\n  palm print at trial when the court previously ruled that the State had improperly\r\nobtained the first palm print during Simmons's custody in Richland County? \r\n(6) Did the circuit court err in charging the jury to find Simmons\r\n  not guilty if they found there was a &quot;real possibility&quot; that he was\r\ninnocent?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court will review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n  v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  This Court is\r\n  bound by the circuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111\r\n  (2000).Â  On review, this Court is limited to determining whether the circuit\r\n  court abused its discretion.Â  State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990).Â  This Court does not reevaluate the facts based on its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the\r\n  circuit court's ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Admissibility\r\n  of Kershaw County Incident\r\nSimmons claims that the circuit court\r\n  erred in permitting any testimony regarding the Kershaw County incident into\r\n  evidence because the testimony violated Rules 404(b) and 403, SCRE.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\n  is inadmissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith; however, such evidence may be admissible &quot;to show\r\n  motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of\r\n  mistake or accident, or intent.&quot;&nbsp; Rule 404(b), SCRE.&nbsp; The evidence\r\n  admitted &quot;must logically relate to the crime with which the defendant has\r\n  been charged.&quot; Â State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679,\r\n682-83 (2000).\r\nWhen the defendant has not been convicted\r\n  of the prior crime, evidence of the bad act must be clear and convincing.[3]&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; If bad act\r\n  evidence is clear and convincing and falls within the Rule 404(b) exception, it\r\n  must nonetheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed\r\n  by the danger of unfair prejudice.&nbsp; See Rule 403, SCRE (although\r\n  relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice); State v. Lyle, 125 S.C.\r\n  406, 417, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923).&nbsp; &quot;Unfair prejudice means an undue\r\n  tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.&quot;&nbsp; State v.\r\n    Dickerson, 341 S.C. 391, 400, 535 S.E.2d 119, 123 (2000).&nbsp; Finally,\r\n  the determination of prejudice must be based on the entire record, and the\r\n  result will generally turn on the facts of each case.&nbsp; State v. Gillian,\r\n373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872, 876 (2007). \r\n\r\n  A. Kershaw County\r\n    Arrest and Stolen Rims \r\n\r\nPrior to the introduction of any testimony\r\n  pertaining to the Kershaw County arrest, the circuit court conducted a pre-trial\r\n  hearing regarding its admissibility under Rule 404, SCRE.&nbsp; The circuit\r\n  court ruled that the State could not question the police on the details of the\r\n  home invasion and the pursuit and capture of Simmons, or on the fact that he\r\n  was bleeding and wounded at the time of his apprehension.&nbsp; The circuit\r\n  court, however, found evidence of the stolen rims on Simmons's vehicle was\r\nadmissible for purposes of linking Simmons with the McDonald's robbery.&nbsp; \r\nOver Simmons's objection at trial,\r\n  Lieutenant Kirk Corley testified that he apprehended Simmons off of a dry creek\r\n  bed in the woods on the evening of April 25, 2004.[4]&nbsp; Corley stated the police took\r\n  Simmons into custody and subsequently impounded his vehicle, which was\r\n  discovered in close proximity to where the police apprehended him. Â When\r\n  questioned as to whether there were any distinguishable items on the vehicle,\r\n  Corley responded that the car had &quot;fairly new shiny rims.&quot;&nbsp; The\r\n  State presented additional testimony to establish that two swabs of dried blood\r\n  were removed from the recovered rims and transported to SLED for DNA analysis,\r\nwhich were then positively matched to DNA samples taken from Simmons.Â  \r\nThe circuit court did not err in admitting\r\n  the objected-to testimony because it clearly linked Simmons to the McDonald's\r\n  robbery, which is permissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE. &nbsp;Here, the evidence\r\n  of the arrest in Kershaw was limited in scope to demonstrate how the police\r\n  obtained custody of Simmons's vehicle, particularly the stolen rims, which was\r\n  necessary to connect Simmons to the McDonald's robbery.Â  See Lyle,\r\n  125 S.C. at 417, 118 S.E. at 807 (&quot;If [evidence of another crime] is\r\n  logically pertinent in that it reasonably tends to prove a material fact in\r\n  issue, it is not to be rejected merely because it incidentally proves the\r\n  defendant guilty of another crime.&quot;).Â  The evidence and witness testimony\r\n  positively showed that the rims on Simmons's vehicle were those stolen from the\r\n  Pontiac Sunfire in the McDonald's parking lot.Â  Consequently, the manner by\r\n  which the police lawfully obtained custody of these rims from Simmons's vehicle\r\n  was logically related to the instant case.Â  See State v. Stokes, 381\r\n  S.C. 390, 405, 673 S.E.2d 434, 441 (2009) (finding evidence of a subsequent\r\n  shooting to establish defendant's identity was admissible under 404(b), SCRE,\r\n  as the evidence from the shooting was logically related to the instant case).Â  This\r\n  evidence clearly aids in establishing the identity of the person who committed\r\n  the robbery at the McDonald's.Â  Further, the circuit court limited the\r\n  prejudicial impact of the testimony when it ruled that the State could not\r\n  question the police on the details of the home invasion, its pursuit of Simmons\r\n  into the woods, his capture, or the fact that he was seriously bleeding and\r\n  required hospitalization after his arrest.Â  As such, the circuit court's\r\nadmission of this testimony did not violate Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\n  B. Blood Evidence\r\n\r\nSimmons objected at the pre-trial hearing to\r\n  the State introducing evidence of his blood on the rims, arguing he bled after\r\n  the Kershaw County case and not in connection with the McDonald's\r\n  robbery.&nbsp; The circuit court overruled this objection, finding that the\r\n  fact the stolen rims were on Simmons's vehicle and that his blood was on the\r\nrims were probative of whether Simmons committed the McDonald's robbery.&nbsp; \r\nSimmons contends that the prejudicial\r\n  value of the blood evidence from the stolen rims outweighs its probative value\r\n  because it suggests that he is a dangerous criminal and was involved in a\r\n  bloody unrelated crime in Kershaw County.Â  However, we find the circuit court\r\n  properly limited the scope of the testimony to prevent Simmons from being\r\n  unduly prejudiced.Â  The jury was never instructed that Simmons was bleeding\r\n  when he was arrested or that the blood on the rims was a result of the Kershaw\r\n  County home invasion, so it could plausibly accept the State's theory that\r\n  Simmons's blood was on the rims because he cut himself when trying to install\r\n  them on the tires.Â  See Cammer v. Atl. Coast Line R. Co., 214\r\n  S.C. 71, 81, 51 S.E.2d 174, 178 (1948) (holding that the tasks of resolving\r\n  contradictions in evidence, determining witnesses credibility, and deciding\r\nwhat testimony to accept when resolving a case are all left to the jury as fact-finder).Â  \r\nFurthermore, while the blood evidence was\r\n  prejudicial, it was not unduly so, as it was probative in identifying Simmons\r\n  as the perpetrator in the McDonald's robbery.Â  See Dickerson, 341\r\n  S.C. at 400, 535 S.E.2d at 123 (&quot;Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency\r\n  to suggest decision on an improper basis.&quot;); See Stokes, 381\r\n  S.C. at 406, 673 S.E.2d at 442 (finding that evidence of a gun in another crime\r\n  was probative of identity under Rule 404(b), SCRE, and while it was\r\n  prejudicial, it was not &quot;unduly prejudicial,&quot; as the weapon from other\r\n  crime linked defendant to gun in instant case).Â  The evidence was not offered\r\n  to show Simmons's bad character, but rather, it was introduced to connect\r\n  Simmons to the rims on the Pontiac Sunfire that were stolen from the McDonald's\r\n  parking lot.Â  Id. (finding evidence of weapon from subsequent shooting\r\n  was admissible under Rules 404(b) and 403, despite defendant's contention that\r\n  it implied &quot;he might be a violent person who may possess a gun,&quot; as\r\n  the weapon connected him to the prior crime).Â  Consequently, the circuit court did\r\n  not err in admitting the limited testimony regarding the blood evidence from\r\nthe stolen rims.Â Â  \r\nII. Voluntariness\r\n  of Statements during Custody\r\nSimmons next maintains that his statements to the police while in\r\n  custody were not freely and voluntarily given because they were the product of\r\n  police coercion.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo determine the voluntariness of a statement, the circuit court\r\n  must first conduct an evidentiary hearing, outside the presence of the jury,\r\n  where the State must show the statement was voluntarily made by a preponderance\r\n  of the evidence.Â  State v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 379, 652 S.E.2d 444,\r\n  448 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  During this hearing, the circuit court must examine the\r\n  totality of circumstances surrounding the statement and determine whether the\r\n  State has carried its burden of proving the statement was given voluntarily.Â  Id. at 382, 652 S.E.2d at 450.Â  If the statement is found to have been given\r\n  voluntarily, it is then submitted to the jury where its voluntariness must be\r\n  established beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Washington, 296 S.C.\r\n  54, 56, 370 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1988).Â  On appeal, the circuit court's decision as\r\n  to the voluntariness of the statement will not be reversed unless so erroneous\r\n  as to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.Â  Miller, 375 S.C. at 378, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 448.Â  \r\nSimmons claims that the police's coercive and threatening actions\r\n  in conjunction with the promise of food and leniency improperly induced him to\r\n  make incriminatory statements.Â  To the contrary, the totality of circumstances\r\n  surrounding his statements demonstrates Simmons made a knowing and voluntary\r\n  waiver of his rights. Â Chief Wilson testified that before Simmons was\r\n  questioned on any details pertaining to the robbery, he read Simmons his Miranda rights from a standard form, which included Simmons's right to counsel.Â  Chief\r\n  Wilson stated that Simmons verbally agreed to waive his rights, but he was not\r\n  asked to sign a waiver of rights form.Â  Although the police did not require\r\n  Simmons to sign a waiver of rights form, this does not necessarily negate the\r\n  voluntary nature of Simmons's statements. Â Cf. State v. Doby, 273\r\n  S.C. 704, 708, 258 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1979) (signing of a waiver of rights form\r\n  is not conclusive as the State must still prove a knowing and voluntary\r\n  waiver). Â After Chief Wilson read Simmons his rights, Simmons stated\r\n  that &quot;he was familiar with how the system worked,&quot; which indicates he\r\n  was aware of his constitutional rights.[5]Â \r\n  While Simmons argues he repeatedly requested counsel during this time, both Chief Wilson and Captain Smith testified to the contrary.Â  The circuit court\r\n  ruled that while Simmons may have told his father and brother that he wanted\r\n  counsel, no evidence or testimony existed to substantiate this assertion, and\r\n  Simmons failed to establish that his request for counsel was relayed to the\r\n  police.Â  Based on the evidence, the circuit court properly exercised its\r\n  discretion in finding the officers' testimony more credible than that of\r\n  Simmons in making its voluntariness determination.\r\nSimmons's contention that he was induced by the promise of food is\r\n  unpersuasive as not even Simmons disputes that he ate before discussing\r\n  the details of the McDonald's robbery.Â  At trial, Chief Wilson testified that\r\n  Simmons complained of hunger while giving his palm print, so he promptly\r\n  requested food for Simmons.Â  Further, the four-hour time frame between the\r\n  initial meal and his subsequent incriminatory statements was not so great as to\r\n  reasonably lead to the conclusion that hunger played a role in making the\r\n  statements.Â  Chief Wilson and Sergeant Barnes stated that the police complied\r\n  with Simmons's subsequent requests for food and drink.Â  Additionally, while\r\n  Simmons was eating, he requested to speak with his family before discussing the\r\n  robbery with the police. Â Chief Wilson agreed and permitted Simmons to\r\n  speak with his family members on the phone, who then came to police\r\n  headquarters and spoke privately with Simmons for approximately thirty\r\n  minutes.Â  It was not until after Simmons spoke with his family that he\r\n  viewed the McDonald's robbery videotape and identified himself as the\r\n  perpetrator.Â  \r\nSimmons also argues that he was induced into making incriminatory\r\n  statements by the solicitor's promise of leniency and by coercive police\r\n  tactics.Â  A statement may not be â€œextracted by any sort of threats or violence,\r\n  [or] obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, [or] obtained\r\n  by the exertion of improper influence.â€Â  Miller, 375 S.C. at 386, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 452 (internal citation omitted).Â  A statement â€œinduced by a promise\r\n  of leniency is involuntary only if so connected with the inducement as to be a\r\n  consequence of the promise.â€ Â Id. (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circumstances surrounding Simmons's statement fail to establish that his\r\n  statements were induced by any promises of leniency or by coercive police\r\n  activity.Â  Before Simmons viewed the videotape, and\r\n  while his family was still present, deputy solicitor John Meadors entered Chief\r\n  Wilson's office and advised Simmons and his family that if Simmons cooperated,\r\n  &quot;it would be considered at sentencing.&quot; Â This was not improper.Â  See id., 375 S.C. at 387, 652 S.E.2d at 453\r\n  (finding that police officers' and assistant attorney general's statements to\r\n  defendant that it was in &quot;his best interests to cooperate&quot; were not\r\n  improper where no one made any direct or implied promises of leniency). Â Chief Wilson denied promising Simmons anything at\r\n  any point during their conversations.Â  Chief Wilson and Captain Smith stated no\r\n  one threatened or coerced Simmons into speaking with the police.Â  Further, when\r\n  Simmons later identified himself as the robber, he was sitting in Captain\r\n  Smith's office where he was not restrained or handcuffed in any manner.Â \r\n  Moreover, the police provided Simmons with an opportunity to not only call but\r\n  also privately consult with his family prior to discussing the robbery.Â  Cf. State v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 138, 382 S.E.2d 911, 914 (1989)\r\n  (acknowledging that a statement induced by the police by preying upon a\r\n  defendant's concern for or desire to contact his family must be excluded from\r\n  evidence as involuntary).Â  While Simmons argues the police's response to his\r\n  initial refusal to give his palm print intimidated him into later making\r\n  incriminatory statements, the intervening events, including the reading of his Miranda rights and consultation with his family, and the lapse of time prevented any prior\r\n  confrontation from reasonably influencing his decision to speak with police.[6]Â Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  in determining whether Simmons voluntarily made the statements, the circuit\r\n  court properly considered the credibility of the witnesses, as it must. Â See Miller, 375 S.C. at 387, 652 S.E.2d at 453 (finding that in a Jackson\r\n    v. Denno hearing, the circuit court has the opportunity to listen to the\r\n  testimony, assess the demeanor and credibility of all witnesses, and weigh the\r\n  evidence accordingly).Â  Simmons contradictorily\r\n  argues on appeal that he was coerced into making incriminatory statements, yet\r\n  he also testified in camera that he never identified himself as the robber in\r\n  the McDonald's videotape; he never watched the videotape; he was never read his Miranda rights; he never waived his rights; and his requests for counsel\r\n  were denied.Â  All of Simmons's assertions directly conflict with the police's\r\n  testimony.Â  As such, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  giving greater weight to the officers' testimony in its voluntariness\r\n  determination based on Simmons's inconsistent testimony of what transpired\r\n  while in custody.Â  See id. (upholding\r\n  the circuit court's determination of voluntariness despite defense attorney's statement that defendant was coerced\r\n  into making a statement by a promise of a lenient sentence when three law\r\n  enforcement officials and an assistant attorney general denied any promise of\r\n  leniency).Â  Consequently, it was proper to allow the jury to ultimately\r\n  decide the voluntariness of Simmons's statements as the State proved by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence that his statements were not induced by any\r\n  promises of leniency.Â  See State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243,\r\n  471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996) (finding that once the circuit\r\n  court determines that the statement is admissible, it is up to the jury to\r\n  ultimately determine whether the statement was voluntarily made). Â \r\nIII. Eyewitness\r\n  Testimony \r\nSimmons claims that the circuit court erred in permitting three\r\n  employees who witnessed the robbery to testify about Simmons's identity because\r\n  their identifications were tainted and unreliable.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  circuit court. Â State v. Tucker,\r\n  319 S.C. 425, 428, 462 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1995).Â  Accordingly, a circuit court's\r\n  decision to allow the in-court identification of an accused will not be\r\n  reversed absent an abuse of discretion or prejudicial legal error.Â  State v. Govan,\r\n  372 S.C. 552, 556, 643 S.E.2d 92, 94 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nAn in-court identification of an accused is inadmissible if a\r\n  suggestive out-of-court identification procedure created &quot;a very\r\n  substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.&quot;Â  Manson v.\r\n    Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 116 (1977).Â  An identification may be reliable\r\n  under the totality of circumstances even when a suggestive procedure has been\r\n  used.Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, 503, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003) (internal citation omitted).Â  To determine whether an identification is\r\n  reliable, it is necessary to consider the following factors: (1) the\r\n  opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2)\r\n  the witness's degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness's prior\r\n  description of the criminal; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the\r\n  witness at the confrontation; and (5) the amount of time between the crime and\r\n  the confrontation.Â  Id. at 504, 589 S.E. 2d at 785.\r\n\r\n  a. L'Marshalett\r\n    Moore and Sophia Thomas\r\n\r\nSimmons argues the circuit court erred in admitting L'Marshalett\r\n  Moore's and Sophia Thomas's in-court identifications because the out-of-court photographic\r\n  line-ups were unduly suggestive and unreliable.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Ms. Moore testified that when she encountered Simmons,\r\n  she was able to get a good look at his face and described him as being tall and\r\n  brown-skinned with a slim face and small ears.Â  She also stated that she was\r\n  very close to Simmons during the robbery because he held a gun to her face and\r\n  that she had an opportunity to look at his face for approximately three or four\r\n  minutes in the store where the lighting was &quot;bright.&quot;Â  Ms. Moore\r\n  testified that at one point she had a &quot;perfect view&quot; of Simmons's\r\n  face.Â  When questioned, Ms. Moore stated that she again observed Simmons's face\r\n  after he forced her and other employees into the restaurant's cooler and that\r\n  the lights were on in the cooler during this time. \r\nAdditionally, Ms. Thomas also testified that when she encountered\r\n  Simmons on the morning of the robbery, he pointed the gun directly at her face,\r\n  took her purse, and forced her into the restaurant's cooler.Â  In identifying\r\n  Simmons, she stated that she was in a well-lit area within a few feet of him at\r\n  the time that she got a &quot;good look&quot; at his face.Â  She further stated\r\n  nothing obstructed her view of Simmons's face, she could clearly see a\r\n  &quot;front view&quot; of his face, and she was able to look at him for several\r\n  seconds.Â  Ms. Thomas described Simmons to police as a skinny, black male who\r\n  was approximately her height.Â  \r\nAfter the robbery, the police presented several McDonald's\r\n  employees, including Ms. Moore and Ms. Thomas, with two sets of photo line-ups.\r\n  Â Simmons's picture was not present in either of these line-ups, and neither Ms.\r\n  Moore nor Ms. Thomas identified anyone in either instance.[7] Â It was not until the third photo\r\n  line-up, which contained Simmons's picture, that Ms. Moore and Ms. Thomas made\r\n  a positive identification.Â  Both witnesses testified that they did not discuss\r\n  the line-up with anyone and that no one told them whom to pick.Â  Ms. Moore\r\n  stated she identified Simmons because of his ears, whereas Ms. Thomas testified\r\n  she identified him because of his face.Â  \r\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, we find the in-court\r\n  identifications were admissible.Â  Despite Simmons's contention that his ears were\r\n  smaller than those of the other individuals in the line-up, his photograph does\r\n  not stand out in such a way as to render the line-up unduly suggestive.Â  See State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 127, 644 S.E.2d 693, 696-99 (2007)\r\n  (finding photo line-up was admissible, despite defendant's assertion that it\r\n  was unduly suggestive due to variations in the background colors on certain\r\n  photos in the line-up); State v. Washington, 323 S.C. 106, 112, 473\r\n  S.E.2d 479, 482 (Ct. App. 1996) (upholding in-court eyewitness identification\r\n  of defendant based on totality of circumstances, despite defendant's objection\r\n  to the dark background in photo line-up and defendant's claim that he was the\r\n  only individual in line-up with a medium length afro-style haircut); State\r\n    v. Roberts, 522 S.E.2d 130, 133 (N.C. App. 1999) (finding photo line-up was\r\n  not unduly suggestive, despite defendant being the only individual in the\r\n  line-up with freckles and a light complexion as &quot;defendant's own unique\r\n  physical appearance was what rendered him conspicuous in the lineup, not any\r\n  suggestive police procedures&quot;).Â  Both eyewitness identifications were\r\n  properly based on their own memories of Simmons's face, which were reconfirmed\r\n  upon viewing Simmons's photo in the line-up.Â  See State v. Davis,\r\n  309 S.C. 326, 339, 422 S.E.2d 133, 142 (1992) (finding that photo line-up was\r\n  not tainted even though victim had opportunity to look at sketch of suspect\r\n  prior to making identification because the victim had her own visual sketch of\r\n  suspect based on her memory of his face and clothing) (overruled on other\r\n  grounds).Â  \r\nWere we to conclude for the sake of argument that the photographic\r\n  line-up was unduly suggestive because of Simmons's ears, the State still presented\r\n  sufficient evidence to establish that both Ms. Moore and Ms. Thomas made\r\n  reliable identifications.Â  See State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C.\r\n  240, 251, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;Reliability is the\r\n  linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.&quot;).Â \r\n  First, both witnesses testified that they had an opportunity to directly view\r\n  Simmons's face during the robbery in a well-lit area.Â  Second, because of their\r\n  close proximity to Simmons in addition to the fact that he was holding a gun\r\n  directly in their face, the witnesses undoubtedly possessed a heightened degree\r\n  of attention.Â  Third, both witnesses' descriptions of Simmons were accurate.Â \r\n  While Ms. Moore may have focused on Simmons's ears in recollecting his identity\r\n  and Ms. Thomas was unsure whether Simmons had facial hair on his chin on the\r\n  day of the robbery, this does not discredit their identifications as they were\r\n  accurate &quot;on the whole.&quot;Â  See State v. Mansfield, 343\r\n  S.C. 66, 79-80, 538 S.E.2d 257, 264 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding eye witness\r\n  identification &quot;on the whole was accurate&quot; even though the witness described the perpetrator as having plaits\r\n  in his hair and wearing tennis shoes while the defendant actually had an afro and\r\n  wore boots).\r\nFourth, both witnesses were certain when they identified Simmons.Â \r\n  At trial, Ms. Moore stated that she was &quot;positive&quot; that the person she\r\n  identified in the line-up as the robber was Simmons, and Ms. Thomas testified\r\n  that she had &quot;no doubt&quot; in her mind that Simmons was the robber after\r\n  viewing the photographic line-up.Â  See Washington, 323 S.C. at\r\n  112, 473 S.E.2d at 482 (upholding in-court eyewitness identification when\r\n  eyewitness testified that defendant &quot;best resembled&quot; the robber); State\r\n    v. Patrick, 318 S.C. 352, 357, 457 S.E.2d 632, 635-36 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n  (finding no abuse of discretion in admission of identification when the victim\r\n  was with the perpetrator under â€œwell-lighted conditions,â€ the victim testified\r\n  she looked at him carefully, and she observed another trial involving the\r\n  defendant and immediately knew the defendant â€œwas the oneâ€). Â Finally, the lapse\r\n  of one month between the crime and the photographic line-up was not so great\r\n  that either witness's identification would be unreliable, particularly given\r\n  the foregoing factors that indicate the reliability of the identifications.Â  See State v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477, 482-83, 562 S.E.2d 689, 692 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002) (upholding admission of victim's in-court identification several years\r\n  after sexual assault and citing Commonwealth v. Wilson, 649 A.2d 435,\r\n  445 (1994), wherein the court found no error in admission of in-court\r\n  identification occurring six and one-half years after the alleged crime).Â \r\n  Based on the totality of circumstances, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  allowing the in-court identifications.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  b. Dawn Richmond\r\n\r\nSimmons next asserts that the circuit court erred in permitting\r\n  Dawn Richmond to testify regarding the photographic line-up and in refusing to\r\n  declare a mistrial when she once referenced the robber as the &quot;defendant&quot;\r\n  when recalling comments the robber made to her during the robbery.Â  We disagree. \r\nMs. Richmond testified at the in camera hearing she could not give\r\n  police a definite answer as to whether the robber was in the line-up, but the\r\n  second photograph in the line-up, which was Simmons's picture, &quot;looked\r\n  like&quot; the robber.Â  Ms. Richmond also testified that the store was well-lit\r\n  and that even though she only saw his face for a few seconds, she got a good\r\n  look at it.Â  When she later attended the bond hearing for the robbery, Ms.\r\n  Richmond stated that she saw Simmons, and while no one told her he was the\r\n  robber, there was no doubt in her mind at that point that he robbed the\r\n  McDonald's.Â  The circuit court did not allow her to make an in-court\r\n  identification, finding her identification at the bond hearing was unduly\r\n  suggestive and would not serve as a proper basis for an in-court\r\n  identification.Â  \r\nAt trial, she testified that after looking at the six photographs\r\n  in the line-up, she selected the second photograph because it looked like the\r\n  robber, although she was not 100% certain.Â  Ms. Richmond also stated that if\r\n  she had seen a side view of the robber, she could have positively identified\r\n  him.Â  When asked why she did not look at him directly, she replied that\r\n  &quot;the defendant&quot; told her not to look at him.Â  Simmons did not make a\r\n  timely objection in response to her statement.Â  It was not until after\r\n  Ms. Richmond finished testifying that Simmons objected to her referencing him\r\n  as &quot;the defendant&quot; and requested a mistrial on that ground.Â  The\r\n  circuit court denied Simmons's motion for a mistrial, finding Ms. Richmond's\r\n  statement was &quot;an inadvertent reference&quot; that did not warrant\r\n  declaring a mistrial. Â The court, however, agreed to give a curative instruction\r\n  to the jury.Â  \r\nMs. Richmond's observations during the course of the robbery were\r\n  properly admitted at trial.Â  Despite the fact that Ms. Richmond lacked absolute\r\n  certainty in identifying Simmons as the robber, our courts have upheld\r\n  identifications by an eyewitness who was not absolutely certain of the\r\n  perpetrator's identity.Â  In State v. Washington, 323 S.C. 106, 111, 473\r\n  S.E.2d 479, 481 (Ct. App. 1996), this Court held that an eyewitness's signed\r\n  statement that the defendant &quot;best resembled&quot; the person who\r\n  attempted to rob the eyewitness was admissible as an out-of-court\r\n  identification.Â  Further, the eyewitness's in-court identification was\r\n  admissible, despite his testimony on direct that there was &quot;no\r\n  question&quot; defendant was the robber.Â  Id. at 112, 473 S.E.2d at\r\n  482.Â  This Court found the eyewitness's in-court identification was reliable\r\n  because &quot;the jury had the opportunity to observe the witness and attach\r\n  the credibility it deemed proper to his testimony, including the certainty or\r\n  uncertainty of his identification . . . .&quot;Â  Id. Â In a similar vein,\r\n  Ms. Richmond testified that when she was presented with the photographic\r\n  line-up, she pointed to Simmons's photograph and said he looked like the robber\r\n  but because of the angle of the picture, she was not 100% certain.Â  Even if her\r\n  identification was not reliable enough to be the basis for an in-court\r\n  identification, the jury was capable of weighing her statements according to\r\n  the degree of certainty or uncertainty she possessed when identifying the\r\n  robber in the photographic line-up.\r\nIn any event, Ms. Richmond's testimony was harmless because it was\r\n  cumulative to other overwhelming evidence that established Simmons's guilt.Â  See State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978)\r\n  (finding the admission of improper evidence is harmless when the evidence is\r\n  merely cumulative to other evidence).Â  The other eyewitness testimony in\r\n  conjunction with the stolen rims, videotape surveillance, DNA and palm print evidence,\r\n  and Simmons's own statements while in custody conclusively prove his guilt,\r\n  regardless of Ms. Richmond's testimony.Â  See State v. Bryant, 369\r\n  S.C. 511, 518, 633 S.E.2d 152, 156 (2006) (holding that an insubstantial error\r\n  not affecting the result of the trial is harmless when a defendant's guilt has\r\n  been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational\r\n  conclusion can be reached).Â  \r\nSimmons also claims that the circuit court erred in denying his\r\n  motion for a mistrial in response to Ms. Richmond referencing the robber as &quot;the\r\n  defendant&quot; during her testimony.Â  This issue is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  State v. Vanderbilt, 287 S.C. 597, 598, 340 S.E.2d 543, 544\r\n  (1986) (finding an issue which is not properly preserved cannot be raised for\r\n  the first time on appeal). Â Simmons failed to make a contemporaneous objection,\r\n  which is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.Â  See State\r\n    v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 51, 406 S.E.2d 315, 319 (1991) (stating a\r\n  contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for\r\n  appellate review); State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 419, 652 S.E.2d 409, 323\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (holding that for an objection to be timely, it must be made at\r\n  the time that evidence is offered).[8]Â  \r\nIV. Violation of\r\n  Sequestration Order\r\nSimmons claims that the circuit court erred by allowing Captain\r\n  Smith to testify at trial because he violated the court's sequestration order.Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nThe circuit court may order the sequestration of witnesses upon\r\n  its own motion or by motion of any party. Â See Rule 615, SCRE. Â A party\r\n  is not entitled to have witnesses sequestered as a matter of right. Â State\r\n    v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 616, 527 S.E.2d 389, 394 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  Rather, the decision to sequester witnesses is left to the sound discretion of\r\n  the circuit court. Â State v. LaBarge,\r\n  275 S.C. 168, 171, 268 S.E.2d 278, 280 (1980); see also State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 375, 509 S.E.2d 819,\r\n  827 (Ct. App. 1998) (allowing the State to recall a reply witness who was\r\n  present in the courtroom during a portion of the trial). Whether to exempt a\r\n  witness from a sequestration order is within the circuit court's discretion. Â Tisdale,\r\n  338 S.C. at 616, 527 S.E.2d at 394.\r\nDuring the Jackson v. Denno hearing, Simmons's counsel\r\n  moved to sequester all testifying witnesses, and the circuit court granted this\r\n  request.Â  Shortly thereafter, Simmons's counsel objected to Captain Smith's\r\n  presence in the courtroom during Chief Wilson's in camera testimony.Â  The State\r\n  responded that Captain Smith was the chief investigating officer, and his\r\n  presence was essential to the presentation of the State's case.Â  The circuit\r\n  court ruled that while Captain Smith could be present during the trial, he\r\n  would need to step out during Chief Wilson's testimony, at which time Captain\r\n  Smith left the courtroom.Â  \r\nLater, Captain Smith, who was to testify after Simmons at the\r\n  pre-trial hearing, entered the courtroom during Simmons's testimony.Â  Simmons's counsel again objected to Captain Smith's presence, and, in response, the\r\n  State noted that Captain Smith was not present for Chief Wilson's testimony.Â \r\n  The circuit court responded that because Smith had been &quot;back and\r\n  forth,&quot; it did not know what Smith heard while in the courtroom; however,\r\n  Smith would still be allowed to testify.Â  When questioned by Simmons's counsel,\r\n  Smith stated he entered the courtroom during Simmons's testimony, but only\r\n  because he was &quot;sent for&quot; to testify.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Smith to testify,\r\n  despite Captain Smith's presence in the courtroom during other witnesses' in\r\n  camera testimony.Â  First, no evidence was presented to establish that Smith\r\n  knowingly and intentionally entered the courtroom in an effort to violate the\r\n  order.Â  While Smith was present for the beginning of Chief Wilson's in camera\r\n  testimony, Smith promptly left the courtroom after the court instructed him to\r\n  leave.Â  Furthermore, Captain Smith was only present for the small portion of\r\n  Chief Wilson's in camera testimony to which he was not a witness during\r\n  Simmons's initial interrogation, so any of Chief Wilson's statements that\r\n  Captain Smith may have heard could not have influenced his subsequent\r\n  testimony.Â  While Captain Smith admitted to being present during Simmons's\r\n  testimony, Captain Smith testified that he entered the courtroom only because\r\n  he was &quot;sent for&quot; as he was the next witness to testify.Â  Moreover, Captain Smith affirmed that his in camera testimony reflected and\r\n  summarized his notes from Simmons's interrogation, and Simmons does not attempt\r\n  to highlight any inconsistencies between Captain Smith's notes and his\r\n  testimony as a result of Captain Smith's presence during Chief Wilson's and\r\n  Simmons's in camera testimony.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in permitting Captain Smith to testify at trial.Â  \r\nV. Admissibility\r\n  of Second Palm Print\r\nSimmons also asserts that the circuit court erred in requiring\r\n  Simmons to give a second palm print at trial when the court previously ruled\r\n  that the police had improperly obtained the first palm print during Simmons's\r\n  custody in Richland County.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits\r\n  unreasonable searches and seizures. Â U.S. Const. Amend. IV.Â  A court order that\r\n  allows the government to procure evidence from a person's body constitutes a\r\n  search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Â Schmerber v. California,\r\n  384 U.S. 757, 767-70 (1966); State v. Register, 308 S.C. 534, 537, 419\r\n  S.E.2d 771, 772 (1992). Â The Fourth Amendment protects against intrusions into\r\n  the human body for the taking of evidence absent a warrant unless there are\r\n  exigent circumstances, such as the imminent destruction of evidence. Â Schmerber,\r\n  384 U.S. at 770; see also State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 460, 462\r\n  S.E.2d 279, 282-83 (1995) (applying Schmerber analysis to search of\r\n  suspect's mouth).Â  \r\nSection 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003) provides for\r\n  the involuntary submission of nontestimonial identification evidence.Â  In re\r\n    Snyder, 308 S.C. 192, 196, 417 S.E.2d 572, 574 (1992); Register, 308\r\n  S.C. at 537, 419 S.E.2d at 772. Â When the State seeks nontestimonial identification\r\n  evidence from arrested or unarrested suspects, constitutional requirements\r\n  mandate that the State prove it has probable cause before the circuit court\r\n  will permit the acquisition of such evidence.Â  Baccus, 67 S.C. at 54,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 223.Â  Following these constitutional requirements, section\r\n  17-13-140 requires a sworn affidavit for a search warrant to be issued. Â Id. at 54, 625 S.E.2d at 223.Â  Under section 17-13-140, a court order may stand in\r\n  place of a search warrant for purposes of procuring nontestimonial evidence.Â  Id. at 55 n.3, 625 S.E.2d at 223 n.3 (reiterating\r\n  that as previously held in Snyder and Register, a court order may\r\n  be issued under section 17-13-140 instead of a search warrant). Â Like a search warrant, a court order requiring a person to\r\n  produce nontestimonial evidence should only be issued upon a finding of\r\n  probable cause, which is supported by oath or affirmation.Â  Id. at 54-55, 625 S.E.2d at 223 \r\nTo establish probable cause, the State must establish the\r\n  following three elements: (1) probable cause to believe the suspect has\r\n  committed the crime; (2) a clear indication that relevant material evidence\r\n  will be found; and (3) the method used to secure it is safe and reliable.Â  Id. at 54,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 223; see also Register, 308 S.C. at 538, 419 S.E.2d at 773.Â  Additional factors to be weighed are the seriousness of the\r\n  crime and the importance of the evidence to the investigation. Â Register,\r\n  308 S.C. at 538, 419 S.E.2d at 773.Â  The circuit court is required to balance\r\n  the necessity for acquiring involuntary nontestimonial identification evidence\r\n  against constitutional safeguards prohibiting unreasonable bodily intrusions,\r\n  searches, and seizures.Â  Id.Â  \r\nSimmons objected at the pre-trial hearing to the admission of the\r\n  palm print that was taken when he was initially detained in Richland County,\r\n  arguing it was taken by force, without a warrant, and without exigent\r\n  circumstances.Â  In response, the State argued that a search warrant was\r\n  unnecessary because Simmons consented to give his palm print.Â  Despite the\r\n  State's argument, the circuit court found that the State failed to establish\r\n  probable cause existed to take Simmons's palm print, particularly when he had\r\n  neither been served with a search warrant nor placed under arrest in Richland\r\n  County.Â  As a result, the circuit court\r\n  excluded the first palm print.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State immediately moved for a Schmerber[9] hearing.Â  In response, Simmons argued the State's\r\n  attempt to take Simmons's palm print was untimely because the State was\r\n  essentially investigating its case during the course of trial as the jury was\r\n  already impaneled, but the circuit court allowed arguments on the issue.Â  After\r\n  hearing arguments from both sides, the circuit court found the State\r\n  presented probable cause to take Simmons's palm print.\r\nRegardless of the admissibility of the first palm print, the\r\n  court's order requiring Simmons to submit to the second palm print was proper\r\n  as the State established probable cause for the acquisition of the palm print\r\n  evidence by satisfying the three-prong test for acquiring nontestimonial\r\n  identification evidence. Â See Register, 308 S.C. at 538, 419\r\n  S.E.2d at 773.Â  First, based on other inculpatory evidence and testimony,\r\n  probable cause existed to show Simmons committed the McDonald's robbery.Â \r\n  Second, Simmons's palm print was needed to determine whether his palm print\r\n  matched the palm print lifted from the stolen Pontiac Sunfire; thus, it was\r\n  necessary, material, and relevant evidence. Â Last, the method used to procure\r\n  his palm print was safe and reliable, and it was the least intrusive means of\r\n  obtaining this evidence. Â Also, as is required for a court order to procure\r\n  nontestimonial evidence, the witnesses were under oath while giving testimony\r\n  to establish probable cause pursuant to the United States and South Carolina\r\n  constitutions.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10; see\r\n    also Baccus, 367 S.C. at 54,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 223.Â  As such, the circuit court's order requiring Simmons to\r\n  submit to a second palm print was proper.[10]Â  \r\nSimmons\r\n  additionally argues that regardless of whether probable cause existed, the\r\n  circuit court erred in allowing the State to continue to investigate its case\r\n  in the middle of trial.Â  The crux of Simmons's argument appears to be that\r\n  introduction of this evidence created unfair surprise that ultimately\r\n  prejudiced him.Â  However, as the circuit court noted, Simmons failed to\r\n  establish that he was unfairly surprised when the initial palm print was taken\r\n  over two years prior to trial and had been produced early in the discovery\r\n  process.Â  Because Simmons had notice prior to trial that the State possessed\r\n  this inculpatory evidence, it was reasonable to believe that this evidence\r\n  might be used in the State's case against him if it were found admissible.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  while the jury had been impaneled, it had not been sworn in when the court made\r\n  its ruling, so Simmons's claim that this ruling permitted the State to\r\n  investigate its case in the middle of trial is inaccurate.Â  Even if the\r\n  trial had begun, there is authority from other states which condones the taking\r\n  of a defendant's prints during trial.Â  See Carter v. State, 485\r\n  So. 2d 1292, 1295 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986) (finding that the circuit court\r\n  properly may order the State to take a defendant's fingerprints during trial\r\n  without violating the defendant's constitutional rights when the court requires\r\n  that notice be given to the defendant and that the fingerprints be taken at a\r\n  reasonable time and place); Sloane v. State, 507 S.W.2d 747, 749 n.1\r\n  (Tex. Crim. App. 1974) (finding defendant's fingerprint that was taken during\r\n  trial was properly admitted into evidence); Martin v. State, 463 S.W.2d\r\n  449, 451 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971) (holding that taking defendant's fingerprints,\r\n  over objection, just prior to jury selection was not error).Â  As a result, the\r\n  circuit court did not commit error in admitting the second palm print into\r\n  evidence. \r\nVI. Jury Charge\r\nSimmons avers that the circuit court erred in its reasonable doubt\r\n  instruction when it told the jury they could not acquit Simmons unless there\r\n  was a &quot;real possibility&quot; that he was not guilty.Â  He contends the\r\n  instruction lessened the State's burden of proving his guilt beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing jury charges for error, this Court must consider the\r\n  circuit court's jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues\r\n  presented at trial. Â Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334\r\n  S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999) (internal quotations and citations\r\n  omitted). Â If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated\r\n  portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â \r\n  A jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains\r\n  the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  Id. at 495-96,\r\n  514 S.E.2d at 574 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Â To warrant\r\n  reversal, a circuit court's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be\r\n  both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Patterson,\r\n  367 S.C. 219, 232, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nThe circuit court gave the following jury instruction, in relevant\r\n  part:\r\nIf based on your consideration of the evidence you are firmly\r\n  convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crimes charged, you must find the\r\n  defendant guilty.Â  If on the other hand, you think there is a real possibility\r\n  that the defendant is not guilty, you must give the defendant the benefit of\r\n  the doubt and find the defendant not guilty.\r\nThis charge was not in error.Â  The Supreme Court approved an\r\n  almost identical reasonable doubt instruction in State v. McHoney, 344\r\n  S.C. 85, 98, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36-37 (2001), and in State v. Darby, 324\r\n  S.C. 114, 116, 477 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1996). \r\nThe Supreme Court in McHoney approved the following jury instruction: \r\nProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly\r\n  convinced of the defendant's guilt. . . . If based upon your consideration of\r\n  the evidence you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime\r\n  charged, then you must find him guilty. If on the other hand you think there\r\n    is a real possibility that he is not guilty, you must give him the benefit of\r\n    that doubt and find him not guilty. \r\n344 S.C. at 98,\r\n  544 S.E.2d at 36 (emphasis in original).Â  Citing to Darby, the Supreme\r\n  Court reiterated that &quot;[c]ourts specifically addressing whether the 'real\r\n  possibility' language lessens the government's burden of proof have held it\r\n  does not in the context of the preceding language requiring that the juror be\r\n  'firmly convinced' of the defendant's guilt.&quot; Id. at 98, 544 S.E.2d\r\n  at 36-37 (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nAs in McHoney and Darby, nothing in the circuit court's\r\n  reasonable doubt instruction suggests that Simmons bears the burden of proof.Â  See id. at 98, 544 S.E.2d at 36; Darby, 324 S.C. at 116, 477 S.E.2d\r\n  at 711.Â  Moreover, the Supreme Court approved of the &quot;real\r\n  possibility&quot; language in State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 155 n.12, 508\r\n  S.E.2d 857, 868 n.12 (1998), and this Court also approved this language in State\r\n    v. Lowery, 332 S.C. 261, 265, 503 S.E.2d 794, 796-97 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  As\r\n  such, Simmons's claim of error on this ground is without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Chief Wilson testified at the in camera hearing that\r\n  he initially went to Simmons's detention cell after he entered the building and\r\n  overheard Simmons arguing with the lab officers about taking his palm print.Â \r\n  The details of Chief Wilson's and Simmons's initial contact were excluded at\r\n  trial because the circuit court ruled that the first palm print taken by the\r\n  Richland County police was not admissible as it was taken prior to Simmons\r\nbeing served with the Richland County warrants. Â \r\n[2] Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). \r\n[3] Clear and convincing evidence is more than a mere\r\n  preponderance, but less than is required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt;\r\n  it does not mean clear and unequivocal.Â  State v. Fletcher, 379 S.C. 17,\r\n24, 664 S.E.2d 480, 483 (2008).\r\n[4] Lieutenant Corley misspoke because the apprehension\r\nactually occurred on May 24, 2004. \r\n[5] Simmons argues that Chief Wilson's statement should\r\n  have been excluded because it was not introduced at the Jackson v. Denno hearing, and the statement inferred that he had a prior criminal history.Â \r\n  Chief Wilson's statement was not prejudicial to Simmons as it was not the focus\r\n  of his testimony, and the State never attempted to introduce any prior criminal\r\n  convictions to emphasize why Simmons would have knowledge of the\r\n  &quot;system.&quot;Â  See State v. Robinson, 238 S.C. 140, 151, 119\r\n  S.E.2d 671, 675-76 (1961) (finding reference to defendant's past conduct was\r\n  not prejudicial because even if the testimony created the inference in the\r\n  jury's mind that the accused had committed another crime, the State never\r\n  attempted to prove the accused had been convicted of some other crime)\r\n(overruled on other grounds).Â  \r\n[6] Simmons additionally contends that the circuit court\r\n  erred in admitting his conversation with Sergeant Barnes while being\r\n  transported to the detention center, specifically Simmons's statement that the\r\n  &quot;chase&quot; was &quot;fun while it lasted.&quot;Â  At the in camera\r\n  hearing, the circuit court redacted several statements from Sergeant Barnes's\r\n  testimony but found that since Barnes's statements were produced in discovery,\r\n  the State would be allowed to pursue this line of questioning unless Simmons\r\n  could establish unfair prejudice.Â  Based upon the facts and\r\n  circumstances of the case, we find Simmons's statement to Barnes was\r\n  voluntarily given and thus admissible at trial.Â  See State v. Smith,\r\n  259 S.C. 496, 499, 192 S.E.2d 870, 871 (1972) (&quot;[T]he question of whether Miranda warnings, having been once given, should be repeated at later stages of the\r\n  interrogation must be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances\r\n  surrounding each case.&quot;).Â  Simmons had first waived his Miranda rights approximately four hours beforehand and had not told police since\r\n  that time that he wanted to remain silent.Â  We believe the relatively short\r\n  lapse of time between the initial Miranda warnings and his subsequent\r\n  incriminatory statement was not too attenuated to require Sergeant Barnes to\r\n  reread Simmons's rights to him.Â Â  See State v. Bailey, 714 S.W.2d\r\n  590 (Mo. App. 1986) (finding that questioning after a break was not a second\r\n  interrogation so as to require a fresh set of Miranda warnings because\r\n  mere lapse of time does not require exclusion of subsequent incriminatory\r\nstatements).\r\n[7] Simmons argues that the circuit court erroneously\r\n  admitted testimony from police officers who stated that certain eyewitnesses\r\n  were shown lineups but were unable to identify Simmons as the robber.Â  Simmons\r\n  contends this testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay as it amounted to\r\n  improper bolstering under Rule 801, SCRE, and it violated Crawford v.\r\n    Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).Â  Even if the police testimony was hearsay,\r\n  the testimony was harmless error that could not have reasonably affected the\r\n  outcome of the trial as none of the witnesses identified Simmons as the\r\n  perpetrator.Â  Consequently, Simmons's conviction should not be set aside on\r\n  this ground because he was not prejudiced by the admission of this testimony.Â  State\r\n    v. Knight, 258 S.C. 452, 454, 189 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1972) (&quot;[A] conviction\r\n  will not be reversed for nonprejudicial error in the admission of\r\nevidence.&quot;). \r\n[8] Regardless of the timeliness of defense counsel's\r\n  objection, the circuit court gave a curative\r\n  instruction, which cured any potential error.Â  See State v. Walker,\r\n  366 S.C. 643, 658, 623 S.E.2d 122, 129 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œGenerally, a curative\r\n  instruction is deemed to have cured any alleged error.â€).Â  Further, Simmons did\r\n  not object to any insufficiencies in the circuit court's curative instruction.Â  See State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d 903,\r\n  912 (1996) (finding an issue is not preserved for appellate review if the\r\n  objecting party accepts the court's ruling and does not contemporaneously make\r\n  an additional objection to the sufficiency of the curative charge or move for a\r\n  mistrial).Â  \r\n[9] Pursuant to Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S.\r\n  757 (1966),Â  the circuit court may issue an order that allows the State to\r\n  procure evidence from a person's body if the State can establish probable cause\r\nfor the acquisition of such evidence. \r\n[10] While not controlling authority, we find the case of State\r\n  v. Ostroski, 518 A.2d 915 (Conn. 1986), to be instructive.Â  In that case,\r\n  the State had illegally obtained a palm print and a blood sample from the\r\n  defendant, both of which were inadmissible at trial because of fourth amendment\r\n  violations.Â  Id. at 542.Â  Citing to Bynum v. U.S., 274 F.2d 767\r\n  (D.C. Cir. 1960), the court found that the inadmissibility of the initial palm\r\n  print and blood sample did not preclude the State from acquiring, through an\r\n  untainted source, a second palm print and blood sample.Â  Id.Â  The court\r\n  allowed the second palm print and blood sample to be introduced at trial because\r\n  the State established probable cause for acquiring the nontestimonial evidence\r\n  pursuant to Schmerber v.

Pope\r\n  were appointed as the SAs. Â The order also limited the authority of Cannon,\r\n  Dallas, and Bradley regarding the Estate and the Trust.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court granted the SAs access to files, books, and records of the Estate\r\n  and the Trust in June 2007.Â  Upon reviewing the Trust's checkbook, the SAs\r\n  discovered a $900,000 check payable to an account at M &amp; T Bank (M &amp; T)\r\n  had been incorrectly deposited in the Trust's checking account.Â  The entire\r\n  $900,000 was removed from the Trust's account between August 1 and December 28,\r\n  2006.Â  The SAs alleged Cannon, rather than Dallas or Bradley, was responsible\r\n  for the transactions associated with the deposit and removal of the funds.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nBecause\r\n  of the misappropriation, the SAs filed a motion seeking removal of one or more\r\n  of the personal representatives and/or trustees.Â  A hearing on the matter was\r\n  held on August 10, 2007, and Cannon voluntarily submitted his resignation as\r\n  personal representative, trustee, and fiduciary to the Estate and the Trust.Â \r\n  Following the hearing, the circuit court issued an order immediately\r\n  relinquishing Cannon's &quot;signatory authority on all transactions, accounts,\r\n  contracts, checks and/or instruments or undertakings of any kind for James\r\n  Brown, the Estate, the Brown Entities, and the Brown Trusts.&quot;Â  Cannon was\r\n  ordered to pay the Estate $350,000 and to provide a full accounting to the SAs\r\n  of all records related to the Estate and the Trust.Â  Cannon paid the $350,000\r\n  that same day.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court held another hearing on September 24, 2007, and issued an order\r\n  on October 2, 2007.Â  In this order, the circuit court found Cannon in contempt\r\n  for failing to account to the SAs.Â  The circuit court scheduled a later hearing\r\n  to determine the willfulness of Cannon's actions in failing to account.Â  Â Â \r\nIn an effort to recoup funds owed to the Estate, the circuit\r\n  court additionally ordered Cannon to pay the Estate $373,000 in the October 2,\r\n  2007 order.Â  This sum was found to be the remaining amount owed from the\r\n  misappropriated $900,000.Â  The circuit court also ordered Cannon to pay $30,000\r\n  as a deposit towards claims related to attorneys' fees and costs.Â Â Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  a hearing was held on November 15 and 20, 2007, to determine both the willfulness\r\n  of Cannon's failure to account and whether Cannon had paid the Estate $373,000\r\n  and $30,000 as mandated by the circuit court's October 2, 2007 order.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, Cannon testified he paid the $30,000 but did not have the ability to\r\n  pay the $373,000.Â  Cannon also stated he participated in the amendment of tax\r\n  returns for James Brown Enterprises Corporation (the Corporation) after his\r\n  resignation and the circuit court's August 10, 2007 order relinquishing all of\r\n  his authority, including his signatory authority.Â Â Â  \r\nOn December 18, 2007, the circuit court issued an\r\n  order finding Cannon in contempt of court for failing to pay the Estate\r\n  $373,000 and for failing to relinquish all of his authority; he was not,\r\n  however, found to be in willful contempt for failing to account.Â  Cannon was\r\n  ordered to be imprisoned for a period of six months, but Cannon could\r\n  &quot;purge himself of this confinement by the payment of the aforementioned\r\n  $373,000, the payment into [the circuit] court of $50,000.00 to be applied\r\n  towards the payment of attorneys' fees as incurred by the various parties, and\r\n  the payment of a fine of $10,000.00.&quot;Â  Cannon had until &quot;January 25,\r\n  2008[,] to completely purge himself.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nCannon filed a motion to reconsider, which the circuit\r\n  court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nI.\r\n  JURISDICTION\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nPersonal\r\n  jurisdiction may be waived, but subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived.Â  Eaddy v. Eaddy, 283 S.C. 582, 584, 324 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1984).Â  Lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, even for the first time\r\n  on appeal, by a party or by the court.Â  Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330\r\n  S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653-54 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.\r\n  SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \r\nCannon\r\n  argues the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue any orders\r\n  regarding his acts as trustee of the Trust.Â  Specifically, Cannon argues\r\n  section 62-7-201 of the South Carolina Code (2009) does not provide the circuit\r\n  court with subject matter jurisdiction over internal trust matters.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;Subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general\r\n  class to which the proceedings in question belong.&quot;Â  Majors v. S.C.\r\n    Sec. Comm'n, 373 S.C. 153, 159, 644 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2007).Â  &quot;The\r\n  jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter of a proceeding is determined\r\n  by the Constitution, the laws of the state, and is fundamental.&quot;Â  Peterson\r\n    v. Peterson, 333 S.C. 538, 547, 510 S.E.2d 426, 431 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nWhen\r\n  construing a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain the intent of the\r\n  legislature.Â  Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354\r\n  S.C. 18, 22, 579 S.E.2d 334, 336 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;A statute should be\r\n  given a reasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and\r\n  policy expressed in the statute.&quot;Â  Id. at 22-23, 579 S.E.2d at\r\n  336.Â  &quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that\r\n  legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\n  language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended\r\n  purpose of the statute.&quot;Â  Id. at 23, 579 S.E.2d at 336.Â  \r\n&quot;The legislature's intent should be ascertained\r\n  primarily from the plain language of the statute.&quot;Â  Id.Â  If,\r\n  however, the language of the statute gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to\r\n  legislative intent, the construing court looks to the statute's language as a\r\n  whole in light of its manifest purpose.Â  Id. at 25, 579 S.E.2d at 337-38.Â \r\n  The construing court may additionally look to the legislative history when\r\n  determining the legislative intent.Â  State v. Byrd, 267 S.C. 87, 92, 226\r\n  S.E.2d 244, 247 (1976).Â Â Â  \r\nIn determining whether the circuit court possessed\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction in the instant matter, we must first examine the\r\n  statutes Cannon argues give the probate court exclusive jurisdiction.Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Probate Code grants the probate court &quot;exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction of proceedings initiated by interested parties concerning the\r\n  internal affairs of trusts.&quot;Â  Â§ 62-7-201(a).Â  This exclusive jurisdiction,\r\n  however, is subject to section 62-1-302(c), which states, &quot;The probate\r\n  court has jurisdiction to hear and determine issues relating to paternity,\r\n  common-law marriage, and interpretation of marital agreements in connection\r\n  with estate, trust, guardianship, and conservatorship actions pending before\r\n  it, concurrent with that of the family court . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-1-302(c) (2009).Â  \r\nSection 62-7-201(a) specifically deals with the internal\r\n  affairs of trusts and grants exclusive jurisdiction to the probate court in\r\n  those proceedings.Â  Section 62-7-201(a) also states, however, that the probate\r\n  court's exclusive jurisdiction is &quot;[s]ubject to the provisions of [s]ection\r\n  62-1-302(c),&quot; meaning there is one instance when this exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction may be taken away from the probate court.Â  Section 62-1-302(c), on\r\n  the other hand, has no language divesting the probate court of exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Rather than divesting the probate court of jurisdiction, section\r\n  62-1-302(c) provides the probate court with additional jurisdiction it did not\r\n  previously have.Â  Section 62-1-302(c) gives the probate court concurrent\r\n  jurisdiction with the family court to determine, in specific circumstances, issues\r\n  of paternity, common-law marriage, and the interpretation of marital\r\n  agreements.Â Â Â  It is, therefore, difficult to reconcile section 62-7-201(a)\r\n  with section 62-1-302(c).Â  Consequently, the plain language of section\r\n  62-7-201(a) referencing section 62-1-302(c) gives rise to uncertainty.Â  We,\r\n  therefore, look to the language of the two statutes as a whole and the\r\n  legislative history to determine the legislative intent of section\r\n  62-7-201(a).Â  See Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc., 354 S.C. at\r\n  25, 579 S.E.2d at 337-38 (&quot;If the language of an act gives rise to doubt\r\n  or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search for\r\n  that intent beyond the borders of the act itself. . . . In construing a\r\n  statute, the court looks to the language as a whole in light of its manifest\r\n  purpose.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nAfter reviewing both the language of section 62-7-201\r\n  and section 62-1-302 as a whole and the legislative history of the two statutes,\r\n  we believe the reference to section 62-1-302(c) in section 62-7-201(a) to be a\r\n  scrivener's error.[1]Â \r\n  We find the legislative intent was to reference section 62-1-302(d), which\r\n  specifically discusses divestment of the probate court's &quot;exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction&quot; and reads, \r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\n  probate court over the foregoing matters, any action or proceeding filed in the\r\n  probate court and relating to the following subject matters, on motion of a\r\n  party, or by the court on its own motion, . . . must be removed to the circuit\r\n  court and in these cases the circuit court shall proceed upon the matter de\r\n  novo: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(4) trusts . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(d) (2009).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  62-7-201 of the South Carolina Trust Code was enacted May 23, 2005. Â Act No.\r\n  66, 2005 S.C. Acts 280, 317.Â  At that time, section 62-1-302(c) was the current\r\n  section 62-1-302(d), discussing the issue of the circuit court's concurrent\r\n  jurisdiction with the probate court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(c) (1987).Â  Subsequently,\r\n  on June 3, 2005, section 62-1-302 was amended, and the legislature added the\r\n  current section 62-1-302(c) and reassigned the sub-section regarding a party's\r\n  right to remove a proceeding to the circuit court to section 62-1-302(d). Act\r\n  No. 132, 2005 S.C. Acts 1528.Â  Therefore, when section 62-7-201 was enacted and\r\n  section 62-1-302(c) was referenced, the legislature was referencing what is the\r\n  current section 62-1-302(d), meaning the legislative intent was to give the\r\n  circuit court jurisdiction to hear trust matters removed from the probate court.Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\nFurther,\r\n  the &quot;South Carolina Comment&quot; section of section 62-7-201 states: \r\n\r\n\t[South Carolina Trust Code] subsections 62-7-201(a)\r\n  and (b) incorporate former South Carolina Probate Code Section 62-7-201\r\n  regarding the Probate Court's exclusive jurisdiction over the internal affairs\r\n  of trusts. . . . Such exclusive jurisdiction is subject to Section 62-1-302(c)\r\n  of the South Carolina Probate Code regarding a party's right to remove a\r\n  proceeding to the circuit court. \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  As the current section 62-1-302(c) discusses the family court's\r\n  jurisdiction and makes no reference to removal of a proceeding or the circuit\r\n  court, this comment can only indicate the legislature intended to refer to\r\n  section 62-1-302(d).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the language of the statutes as a whole, the statutes' comments, and the\r\n  legislative history, we find the legislative intent of section 62-7-201(a) is\r\n  to allow removal of internal trust matters, by a party or the probate court on\r\n  its own motion, to the circuit court.Â  Therefore, it was proper for the probate\r\n  court to remove the matter to the circuit court on the court's own motion,\r\n  giving the circuit court subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.Â  \r\nB. PERSONAL JURISDICTION \r\nCannon\r\n  argues he was never made a party to any proceedings in his capacity as trustee,\r\n  has never been served with a rule to show cause for contempt, and was only\r\n  before the circuit court in his capacity as personal representative, and therefore,\r\n  the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\n&quot;By\r\n  accepting appointment, a personal representative submits personally to the\r\n  jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be\r\n  instituted by any interested person.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-602 (2009).Â \r\n  &quot;By accepting the trusteeship of a trust having its principal place of\r\n  administration in this State . . . the trustee submits personally to the\r\n  jurisdiction of the courts of this State regarding any matter involving the\r\n  trust.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-202(a) (2009).Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n&quot;Although\r\n  a court commonly obtains personal jurisdiction by the service of the summons\r\n  and complaint, it may also obtain personal jurisdiction if the defendant makes\r\n  a voluntary appearance.&quot;Â  Stearns Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Glenwood Falls,\r\n    LP, 373 S.C. 331, 337, 644 S.E.2d 793, 796 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  &quot;Voluntary appearance by [a] defendant is equivalent to personal service .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  Rule 4(d), SCRCP.Â  &quot;A defendant may waive any complaints he\r\n  may have regarding personal jurisdiction by failing to object to the lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction and by appearing to defend his case.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Dudley, 354 S.C. 514, 542, 581 S.E.2d 171, 186 (Ct. App. 2003); see Cheraw\r\n      Motor Sales Co. v. Rainwater, 125 S.C. 509, 513 119 S.E. 237, 239 (1923)\r\n  (&quot;The defendant filed his answer and tried his case on the affidavit in\r\n  attachment, and thereby waived his right to his motion [to dismiss the\r\n  proceedings because there was no summons and complaint served].&quot;).Â  \r\nThis\r\n  failure to object resulting in waiver of personal jurisdiction applies equally\r\n  in constructive contempt cases.Â  See Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C.\r\n  612, 629, 576 S.E.2d 156, 165 (2003) (finding constructive contempt proceedings\r\n  are commenced by a rule to show cause and that the record indicated service of\r\n  the rule to show cause was not accomplished correctly, but because the\r\n  appellant never raised the issue, his objections to personal jurisdiction were\r\n  waived).Â Â Â Â  \r\nShortly\r\n  after Brown's death, a petition for the removal of Cannon as trustee was filed\r\n  in the probate court.Â  A certificate of service was served upon Cannon's\r\n  counsel.Â  The probate court, on its own motion, removed all matters to the\r\n  circuit court, with no objection by Cannon.Â  Later, a petition for accounting\r\n  was filed, and Cannon's counsel signed an &quot;Acknowledgement of\r\n  Service,&quot; which waived all objections to defects in service of process.Â Â Â  \r\nCannon\r\n  and his counsel appeared at the August 10, September 24, and November 15 and\r\n  20, 2007 hearings and never made a motion or an objection as to the personal\r\n  jurisdiction of the circuit court.Â  At the August 10, 2007 hearing, counsel for\r\n  the SAs began by discussing their &quot;motion related to the recommendation\r\n  that one or more of the [personal] representatives and trustees be\r\n  removed.&quot;Â  Counsel stated, &quot;[A]lthough some of these captions bear\r\n  the name Estate, this is an order that clearly extends to the estate â€“ a\r\n  recommendation that it extends to the estate, the trusts, and what we call the\r\n  Brown entities . . . .&quot;Â  Again, no objection was made by Cannon or his\r\n  counsel.Â  Cannon then specifically consented to the terms of the August 10,\r\n  2007 order, which formed the basis for all contempt proceedings.Â Â Â  \r\nBefore the conclusion of the August 10, 2007 hearing,\r\n  the circuit court issued an &quot;oral subpoena&quot; ordering Cannon to be\r\n  present at the September 24, 2007 hearing, ready &quot;to be called for\r\n  testimony subject to cross examination .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  As before,\r\n  no objection was made.Â  With this oral subpoena, the circuit court gave Cannon\r\n  actual notice of the proceedings in which he was a party, and in response,\r\n  Cannon and his counsel appeared and again argued the merits.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCannon\r\n  clearly had notice of all proceedings and waived any defects that might have\r\n  occurred.Â  See Stickland v. Consol. Energy Prods. Co., 274 S.C.\r\n  554, 555, 265 S.E.2d 682, 683 (1980) (&quot;A general appearance constitutes a\r\n  voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the court and waives any defects\r\n  and irregularities in the service of process.&quot;); H.S. Chisholm, Inc. v.\r\n    Klinger, 229 S.C. 8, 16, 91 S.E.2d 538, 542 (1956) (&quot;[T]he appellants\r\n  had actual notice of the issuance and contents of the rule [to show cause,\r\n  which was improperly filed] by the personal service of it upon them, and in\r\n  response to it they appeared by counsel.&quot;).Â  Cannon never raised the issue\r\n  of improper service of process and, consequently, never objected to personal\r\n  jurisdiction of the circuit court.Â  See Bakala, 352 S.C. at 629,\r\n  576 S.E.2d at 165 (finding husband never raised the issue of improper service\r\n  of rule to show cause in constructive contempt case and, therefore, waived his\r\n  objection to personal jurisdiction).Â  By appearing and arguing the merits of\r\n  the action multiple times before the circuit court, we find Cannon consented to\r\n  the circuit court's personal jurisdiction and waived any defense of lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction.[2]Â  \r\nFinding\r\n  the circuit court had both subject matter jurisdiction and personal\r\n  jurisdiction to hear this matter, we now address the merits of Cannon's\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\nII. CONTEMPT\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A\r\n  decision on contempt rests within the sound discretion of the [circuit]\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 71, 615 S.E.2d 465, 473 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005). Â It is within the circuit court's discretion to punish by fine or\r\n  imprisonment every act of contempt before the court.Â  Miller v. Miller,\r\n  375 S.C. 443, 454-55, 652 S.E.2d 754, 760 (Ct.

Widman,\r\n  348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;A willful act is\r\n  one . . . done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do\r\n  something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something\r\n  the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey\r\n  or disregard the law.&quot;Â  Miller, 375 S.C. at 454, 652 S.E.2d at\r\n  759-60 (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  \r\n&quot;In addition, courts have the inherent power to\r\n  punish for offenses that are calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the\r\n  administration of justice.&quot;Â  Id. at 455, 652 S.E.2d at 760.Â \r\n  &quot;[J]udges have the authority to [sua sponte] use contempt\r\n  proceedings to preserve the authority and dignity of their courts.&quot;Â  McEachern\r\n    v.

App. 1998).Â  \r\n&quot;Once the moving party has made out a prima facie\r\n  case [for contempt], the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his\r\n  . . . defense and inability to comply with the order.&quot;Â  Miller, 375\r\n  S.C. at 454, 652 S.E.2d at 760.Â  If, through no fault of his own, the contemnor\r\n  is unable to obey a court order, the contemnor cannot be held in contempt.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is a distinction between constructive and direct contempt.Â  Floyd, 365\r\n  S.C. at 75, 615 S.E.2d at 475.Â  &quot;Constructive contempt is contempt that\r\n  occurs outside the presence of the court.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;In contrast,\r\n  direct contempt involves contemptuous conduct occurring in the presence of the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, &quot;[c]ontempt can be either civil or\r\n  criminal.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The distinction between civil and criminal\r\n  contempt is crucial because criminal contempt triggers additional\r\n  constitutional safeguards.&quot;Â  Ex parte Jackson, 381 S.C. 253, 259,\r\n  672 S.E.2d 585, 588 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;Intent for purposes of criminal\r\n  contempt is subjective, not objective, and must necessarily be ascertained from\r\n  all the acts, words, and circumstances surrounding the occurrence.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 571-72, 611 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct.

Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 386, 287\r\n  S.E.2d 915, 920 (1982) (stating a purpose of civil contempt is to coerce the\r\n  defendant to comply with a court order); Miller, 375 S.C. at 462, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 764 (finding the contempt proceeding was civil in nature because the\r\n  term of imprisonment was not unconditional or fixed and the contemnor could\r\n  obtain release by complying with the court's directive).Â Â Â  \r\nFinding\r\n  civil contempt, the record must contain clear and convincing evidence of\r\n  Cannon's contemptuous behavior.Â  See Durlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C.\r\n  64, 70-71, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (stating an appellate court should\r\n  reverse a decision regarding contempt if it is without evidentiary support or\r\n  the circuit court abused its discretion, and clear and convincing evidence must\r\n  support a finding of civil contempt).Â  Cannon provided the circuit court with\r\n  clear and convincing evidence, through his testimony and conduct, upon which to\r\n  base its decision, including admitting to not complying with either circuit\r\n  court order. Â Cannon went so far as to testify that he knowingly and willfully\r\n  disregarded an order of the circuit court.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAs for Cannon's failure to pay the Estate $373,000 as\r\n  ordered by the circuit court on October 2, 2007, Cannon readily admitted he did\r\n  not pay the fee.Â  Cannon, however, argued he did not have the ability to pay\r\n  the fee and, therefore, could not comply with the court order.Â  The circuit\r\n  court did not find this testimony to be credible.Â  This finding was in light of\r\n  the evidence of Cannon's earnings from the previous seven years, the purchase\r\n  of land in Honduras, and his entry into a contract for the construction of a\r\n  home on that land.Â  \r\nAccording to Cannon's federal income tax returns,[3] Cannon's adjusted gross income from 2000 to 2006 was as follows: $1,397,000;\r\n  $959,851; $169,334; $749,639; negative $514,509;[4] $348,831; and $1,058,790, respectively.Â  Additionally, Cannon claimed\r\n  $1,529,000 in deductions from his business income in 2003.Â  Further, $1,323,972\r\n  in income was reported on a Schedule C form attached to Cannon's 1999 tax\r\n  return.Â  When asked by the circuit court to provide a current financial\r\n  statement, Cannon provided one showing his current net value to be negative\r\n  $311,592.38.Â Â Â  \r\nCannon also testified as to the land and the contract\r\n  to build a home he and his wife purchased in Honduras around August 16, 2007.Â \r\n  This purchase took place less than one week after the hearing where the circuit\r\n  court ordered Cannon to pay the Estate $350,000 of the $900,000 that had been\r\n  misappropriated, where the circuit court raised serious questions about those\r\n  remaining funds, and where the circuit court made it clear the payment of\r\n  $350,000 was only a partial payment.Â  Cannon testified he and his wife planned\r\n  to retire in Honduras, which was the reason for building in that location.Â \r\n  Cannon and his wife formed a corporation in Honduras called Bay Island\r\n  Hermitage in order to buy property in the country; Cannon and his wife equally\r\n  own 99% of the corporation while a Honduran attorney owns 1%, which is required\r\n  by Honduran law.Â  Cannon stated he paid $223,000 for the lot in Honduras and\r\n  then $866,000 for a &quot;turn-key contract&quot; for the construction and\r\n  furnishing of a home.Â  Cannon stated he paid the entire cost up front in cash,\r\n  and the property is unencumbered.Â  He also testified, however, that the funds\r\n  used for these purchases belonged to his wife.Â Â Â Â  \r\nBased on the record, we find there was clear and\r\n  convincing evidence Cannon was in contempt of the October 2, 2007 court order\r\n  requiring him to pay the Estate $373,000.Â  Remaining mindful the circuit court\r\n  was in a better position to judge the credibility of the witnesses, we also\r\n  find Cannon failed to carry his burden of proving he was without fault in not\r\n  being able to satisfy the circuit court's order.Â  See Reed v. Ozmint,\r\n  374 S.C. 19, 24, 647 S.E.2d 209, 211 (2007) (deferring to the circuit court\r\n  because the judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony); Thornton\r\n    v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 112, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94-95 (1997) (stating that in\r\n  response to the husband's argument he could not pay child support and should,\r\n  therefore, not be held in contempt for failure to pay, our Supreme Court looked\r\n  at factors which included: &quot;(1) Husband's ownership of valuable property,\r\n  as evidenced by his own financial declaration; [and] (2) Husband's extensive\r\n  history of lying to virtually everyone about his assets or hiding those\r\n  assets&quot;); see generally 17 Am. Jur. 2d Contempt Â§ 141\r\n  (2008) (&quot;The defense of inability to comply with a court order is not\r\n  available where the contemnor has voluntarily created the incapacity or, said\r\n  another way, when the inability to comply is self-induced.&quot;).Â  Thus, the\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in holding Cannon in contempt.Â Â  \r\nAs\r\n  for Cannon's failure to relinquish all authority relating to the Estate, the\r\n  Trust, and the related entities by participating in the amendment of some of\r\n  the Corporation's tax returns, Cannon unequivocally stated that despite knowing\r\n  the circuit court's order prohibited him from doing so, he disregarded the\r\n  order and amended the tax returns with no authority.Â  At the hearing to\r\n  determine the willfulness of Cannon's failure to account and whether he had\r\n  paid specified sums to the Estate, Cannon admitted he amended corporate tax\r\n  returns for the Corporation, which were filed September 26 and October 16,\r\n  2007, after his resignation as personal representative and trustee on August\r\n  10, 2007.Â  When questioned as to whether he was aware of the circuit court's\r\n  order relinquishing his duties effective upon his resignation, he stated he had\r\n  notice of the order and understood he did not have the authority to take the\r\n  actions he took.Â  Cannon informed the circuit court &quot;[he] knew that\r\n  probably [he] would have to take the heat for [amending the tax returns without\r\n  authority], but [he] would rather take the heat for doing it than not doing\r\n  it.&quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record contains clear and convincing evidence that Cannon was in contempt of\r\n  the circuit court's August 10, 2007 order, and again, Cannon failed to carry\r\n  his burden of proving a defense for his actions.Â  Consequently, there was no\r\n  abuse of discretion in the circuit court's finding of contempt.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinding\r\n  the circuit court was correct to hold Cannon in civil contempt, we must also\r\n  review the sanction imposed by the circuit court.Â Â  Cannon was sentenced to six\r\n  months imprisonment with the ability to purge his confinement by paying\r\n  specified fees and fines.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the circuit\r\n  court's imposition of the six-month prison sentence or in handing Cannon the\r\n  keys to his prison by allowing him to purge the confinement upon the payment of\r\n  $373,000 as previously ordered by the court.Â  We do, however, take issue with\r\n  the $50,000 award towards attorneys' fees, and we find the $10,000 fine to be\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nRegardless of whether a six-month imprisonment\r\n  sentence is imposed for civil or criminal contempt, a contemnor has no right to\r\n  a jury trial for an imprisonment sentence of six months or less.Â  See Curlee,\r\n  277 S.C. at 385, 287 S.E.2d at 919 (&quot;If [the contempt] was civil, [the\r\n  contemnor's] sentence of one year without a right to jury trial is proper.Â  If\r\n  it was criminal, [the contemnor] had a constitutional right to a jury trial\r\n  before a sentence of more than six months could be imposed.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added); Passmore, 363 S.C. at 572, 611 S.E.2d at 275\r\n  (&quot;Currently, these provisions [of the Constitution] require a contemnor to\r\n  be allowed a jury trial when facing a serious sentence-i.e., one of greater\r\n    than six months in prison.&quot;) (emphasis added). Â Cannon was, therefore,\r\n  not deprived of any due process rights with the imposition of a six-month\r\n  imprisonment sentence, especially in this civil contempt proceeding.[5] Â Â \r\nFurthermore, Cannon's sentence was made conditional on\r\n  his compliance with the circuit court's order.Â  As we have already stated,\r\n  looking at the evidence in the record and deferring to the circuit court on\r\n  matters of credibility, we find Cannon either had the ability to pay the\r\n  $373,000 to purge his confinement or was unable to pay this fee as a direct\r\n  consequence of his own actions and behavior from the start of the proceedings.Â  See Miller, 375 S.C. at 454, 652 S.E.2d at 760 (stating contemnor\r\n  must be without fault in his inability to comply with the court order); cf. Thornton, 328 S.C. at 104, 492 S.E.2d at 90-91 (stating the family court\r\n  found husband had the ability to pay arrearages of $21,000 and was, therefore,\r\n  in contempt for failure to pay, despite his claim that he lacked the means to\r\n  pay because husband had received approximately $350,000 from a recent legal\r\n  settlement, he had a &quot;substantial&quot; lifestyle, and he owned several\r\n  properties, including a lien-free Georgetown office valued at $250,000 and a\r\n  one-half interest in a Colorado vacation home valued at $600,000). \r\n&quot;Courts, by exercising their contempt power, can\r\n  award [attorneys'] fees under a compensatory contempt theory.&quot;Â  Cheap-O's\r\n    Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 609, 567 S.E.2d 514, 520 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002) (citation omitted).Â  The award of attorneys' fees is not a punishment but\r\n  an indemnification to the party bringing the action.Â  Miller, 375 S.C.\r\n  at 463, 652 S.E.2d at 764-65.Â  Because the record lacks sufficient evidence\r\n  from which the circuit court could determine the appropriate amount of attorneys'\r\n  fees required for reimbursement, we find the $50,000 award for attorneys' fees\r\n  to be an abuse of discretion.Â  We reverse and remand the issue of attorneys'\r\n  fees to the circuit court for findings of fact as to the proper amount of\r\n  attorneys' fees required for indemnification.Â  Â \r\nCourts may also impose fines on a party held in\r\n  contempt.Â  Cheap-O's Truck Stop, Inc., 350 S.C. at 609, 567 S.E.2d at\r\n  520.Â  &quot;If the sanction is a fine, it is punitive when it is paid to the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Poston, 331 S.C. at 112, 502 S.E.2d at 89.Â  A fine may\r\n  also be &quot;remedial and civil if paid to the complainant even though the\r\n  contemnor has no opportunity to purge himself of the fine . . . .&quot;Â  Miller,\r\n  375 S.C. at 457, 652 S.E.2d at 761 (citations omitted).Â  However, &quot;[a]ny\r\n  component of a sanction must be directly related to the contemptuous conduct\r\n  and the loss incurred by the offended party.&quot;Â  Cheap-O's Truck Stop,\r\n    Inc., 350 S.C. at 609, 567 S.E.2d at 520.Â  \r\nThe circuit court imposed an additional $10,000 fine\r\n  on Cannon.Â  The order did not state the purpose of the fine. If the fine was\r\n  imposed for compensation purposes, it was improper because the record contains\r\n  no reasonable relationship between Cannon's contemptuous conduct and the\r\n  imposition of the $10,000 fine. Â Consequently, we reverse the $10,000 fine\r\n  imposed.Â  Cf. id. (reversing the circuit court's improper\r\n  imposition of a fine on the contemnor).Â  \r\nCannon\r\n  also argues the circuit court erred in (1) finding Cannon in civil contempt for\r\n  conduct that took place after August 10, 2007, and (2) imposing a purge remedy\r\n  based upon the assets or financial strength of Cannon's wife.Â  We find these\r\n  arguments abandoned on appeal due to Cannon's failure to cite any legal\r\n  authority in support of either argument. Â See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb,\r\n  362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating an issue is\r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal when no legal authority is cited to support the\r\n  argument).Â Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Cannon argues the circuit court erred in requiring him to pay $373,000 into the\r\n  circuit court regarding a disputed civil claim even though Cannon had not been\r\n  served with a summons and complaint affording him an opportunity to be heard\r\n  and to engage in discovery, thereby placing him in the position of being estopped with regard to any claim that may be brought against him for the funds\r\n  that are at issue.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nCannon\r\n  begins his argument with the premise that the circuit court held him in both\r\n  civil and criminal contempt.Â  As previously discussed, we find the present\r\n  contempt proceedings to be civil in nature, meaning the additional\r\n  constitutional safeguards required in criminal contempt proceedings were not\r\n  triggered.Â  See Ex parte Jackson, 381 S.C. at 259, 672 S.E.2d at\r\n  588 (&quot;The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is crucial\r\n  because criminal contempt triggers additional constitutional\r\n  safeguards.&quot;).Â  Further, even if the contempt proceedings were criminal in\r\n  nature, Cannon was not entitled to a jury trial on the matter because his imprisonment\r\n  sentence did not exceed six months.Â  See Curlee, 277 S.C. at 385,\r\n  287 S.E.2d at 919 (&quot;If [the contempt] was civil, [the contemnor's]\r\n  sentence of one year without a right to jury trial is proper.Â  If it was\r\n  criminal, [the contemnor] had a constitutional right to a jury trial before a\r\n  sentence of more than six months could be imposed.&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added); Rhoad v.

Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733\r\n  (1998).Â  Cannon failed to raise this argument to the circuit court despite his\r\n  many opportunities to do so.Â  Thus, we will not address this argument.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While our analysis does not rely on or give weight to\r\n  the proposed amendment, we note on March 26, 2009, the South Carolina House of\r\n  Representatives proposed a bill to amend section 62-7-201(a) to read,\r\n  &quot;Subject to the provisions of Section 62-1-302(c) and (d), . . .\r\n  .&quot; H.R. 3803, 118th Sess. (S.C. 2009) (emphasis in original).Â Â  \r\n[2] We additionally note, Cannon's counsel conceded the\r\n  circuit court had personal jurisdiction over Cannon at oral arguments.Â  \r\n[3] Due to IRS and SLED investigations involving Cannon's\r\n  income, Cannon continually invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege on questions\r\n  concerning his income.Â  The circuit court was, therefore, only able to use the\r\n  numbers listed on his federal income tax returns, with no explanations or\r\n  discussions, to determine Cannon's income from 2000-2006.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[4] The circuit court's December 18, 2007 order\r\n  incorrectly stated Cannon's adjusted gross income for 2004 was $514,509.Â \r\n  Cannon's 2004 federal income tax return showed Cannon had a business income of\r\n  $203,226 and took deductions of $721,601.Â  Cannon's adjusted gross income for\r\n  2004 was negative $514,509.Â  During this testimony, Cannon again invoked his\r\n  Fifth Amendment privilege, giving the circuit court no explanation of the\r\n  significant deductions taken in 2004.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[5] Additionally, at the November 2007 contempt hearing,\r\n  Cannon's counsel highlighted the right to a jury trial when a criminal contempt\r\n  sentence exceeds six months.Â  The circuit court responded that Cannon's\r\n  sentence would not exceed six months.Â  Moreover, counsel did not request any\r\n  rights associated with a criminal proceeding even if we were to construe the\r\n  fine as a criminal sanction.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4571","title":"State v.

Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Kevin Dwayne Goodwin appeals his\r\n  convictions and sentences for first-degree burglary and murder.Â  Goodwin argues\r\n  the trial court erred in admitting his statements into evidence and denying his\r\n  mistrial motion. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 7, 2004,\r\n  Dr. Joseph Dillard's residence was burglarized.Â  Sometime during the burglary,\r\n  Dillard returned home, surprised the intruder, and was fatally shot.Â  During a\r\n  search of Dillard's home, a cigar butt containing DNA evidence was found near\r\n  the point of entry, which was a broken window in the back of the house.\r\nFive days later,\r\n  Officer Derwood Joseph Barton, Jr. was contacted by a DNA analyst who informed\r\n  him the DNA found on the cigar butt matched Goodwin's DNA.[1]Â \r\n  As a result, Barton visited three locations he suspected Goodwin frequented to\r\n  obtain physical descriptions for potential search warrants.Â  At the same time,\r\n  Officer Bryant William Hinson, Jr. was in transit to get the magistrate to sign\r\n  an arrest warrant alleging Goodwin was responsible for burglarizing Dillard's\r\n  home.\r\nWhen Barton arrived\r\n  at one of the three locations he suspected Goodwin frequented, he observed\r\n  Goodwin outside.Â  Barton asked him for assistance in an attempt to dispel\r\n  suspicion, but Goodwin shook his head and walked back inside the house.Â  Barton\r\n  then moved his vehicle to the entrance of the dead-end road where he could\r\n  maintain visual surveillance, and called for backup.Â  Hinson heard Barton's\r\n  request for backup and responded before he obtained the magistrate's signature\r\n  on the arrest warrant.Â  \r\nAfter additional\r\n  officers arrived, Goodwin attempted to leave the house in a car with his\r\n  grandmother.Â  The officers stopped his vehicle and arrested Goodwin for the\r\n  burglary charge.Â  After the arrest, officers arrived with a search warrant and\r\n  searched the residence.Â  \r\nGoodwin was\r\n  transported to the police station where he was interrogated by Hinson and\r\n  Barton.Â  The interrogation was audio-taped.Â  Hinson advised Goodwin of his\r\n  right to remain silent and his right to an attorney.Â  When asked if he\r\n  understood his rights, Goodwin replied in the affirmative.Â  Hinson asked\r\n  Goodwin if he was willing to speak with them, and Goodwin replied:Â  &quot;I'll\r\n  listen, yeah I'll listen.&quot;Â  Then Hinson asked Goodwin if he would be\r\n  willing to sign the waiver of rights form, and the following colloquy took\r\n  place:\r\n\r\n  Hinson:Â \r\n    Okay.Â  Are you willing to sign this?\r\n  Goodwin:Â \r\n    So what is it say . . . .\r\n  Hinson:Â \r\n    All it is . . . .\r\n  Goodwin:Â \r\n    . . . sign over my rights?\r\n  Hinson:Â \r\n    All it is, is your basically saying that we told you these, you understand them\r\n    and you're willing to talk to us.Â  As you read, you don't have to say a thing\r\n    if you don't want to.\r\n  Barton:Â \r\n    Right.Â  You're not signing any rights away, I'll [sic] you gotta do, if you don't\r\n    want to talk to us, don't talk to us.Â  If, if you want to stop, you can stop.\r\n  Goodwin:Â \r\n    Yeah, I'll sign.Â  Yeah, I'll listen.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Goodwin signed\r\n  the waiver.Â  \r\nOnce the\r\n  interrogation began, Hinson informed Goodwin they had DNA and fingerprint\r\n  evidence linking him to the burglary.Â  However, at that point in their\r\n  investigation, the palm print found at Dillard's house had not yet been matched\r\n  to Goodwin.Â  Additionally, Hinson informed Goodwin that Dillard's neighbors saw\r\n  him at the time of the burglary.Â  However, during his cross-examination at\r\n  trial, Hinson testified the neighbor indicated they saw someone at Dillard's\r\n  before the police arrived, but did not identify Goodwin as the perpetrator. Â Moreover,\r\n  Hinson pressed Goodwin about the guns stolen from Dillard's house:\r\n\r\n  And we'd\r\n    like to get the guns.Â  I mean, we've already been in a couple of houses, we're\r\n    fixing to go to a couple of more houses.Â  I mean I don't want to waste our time\r\n    anymore than we have to, going all over these places harassing people, going in\r\n    people's houses that had absolutely nothing to do with this and putting them\r\n    in, ya know, putting them out and staying there hours on end cause these are\r\n    your loved ones that we going to these houses, or your friends, that we going\r\n    to these houses.Â  I mean, I don't want to do that.Â  I'm sure you don't want us\r\n    to have to do that or you don't want it for them anyway.\r\n\r\nEventually, Goodwin admitted\r\n  to breaking into the house, but denied killing Dillard.Â  Barton asked:Â  &quot;Alright,\r\n  you didn't kill nobody, but, who took you to the house?&quot;Â  Goodwin\r\n  responded:Â  &quot;I'm saying I can have some time to think on this here?Â  I can\r\n  think on this?&quot;Â  Hinson replied:Â  &quot;Well, you think on that and we'll\r\n  think of something else to ask you.Â  How about that.Â  You think, you think\r\n  about that.&quot;Â  The officers began to question Goodwin about the stolen\r\n  guns.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter,\r\n  the officers began questioning Goodwin about the stolen jewelry.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Barton began discussing what Goodwin could be charged with:Â  &quot;You, you\r\n  understand, you understand, you, you're in the house, were in the house, you\r\n  admitting to being in the house, you admitting to taking the gun.Â  If you take\r\n  one gun or if you take the whole house, it's still burglary [first].&quot;Â  The\r\n  officers then began to tell Goodwin it would be in his best interest to tell\r\n  them what happened, and Barton stated:Â  &quot;[T]he longer you wait, the more\r\n  chance that somebody else is going to tell your story or tell their side of a\r\n  story that doesn't sound good for you and you won't get to tell your story\r\n  because we won't need to talk to you.&quot;Â  \r\nAs a result,\r\n  Goodwin began talking about how he would receive a life sentence regardless of\r\n  whether he identified the murderer because of the burglary charge and his\r\n  previous conviction.Â  Then, Barton pointed out that South Carolina also\r\n  employed the death penalty.Â  Goodwin replied that the death penalty would be\r\n  better than a life sentence.Â  \r\nNext, the officers\r\n  began to push Goodwin to talk by discussing Goodwin's family and their\r\n  reactions to the burglary and murder:\r\n\r\n  Barton:Â \r\n    Do you know how bad tore up your daddy is right now?\r\n  Goodwin:Â \r\n    Huh, yeah.\r\n  Barton:Â \r\n    And your momma.\r\n  Goodwin:Â \r\n    um, yeah.\r\n  Barton:Â \r\n    I mean they good people . . .\r\n  Hinson:Â \r\n    And your girlfriend too\r\n  Goodwin:Â \r\n    Yeah, I know.\r\n  Barton:Â \r\n    But you want your kids, your 6 and 11 year old child to think that you're a\r\n    cold blooded murderer, that you would just put somebody down and shoot them in\r\n    the back of the head.Â  Not that you had, you know, that's, but if you don't\r\n    tell your side, you don't tell that somebody else was there or whatever, they'll\r\n    never know.\r\n\r\nGoodwin began telling the\r\n  officers that he entered the house to rob it after he noticed it was already\r\n  burglarized.Â  He admitted to stealing a gun, some jewelry, and urinating in the\r\n  bathroom.Â  Hinson then instructed Goodwin they were matching footprints found\r\n  at the scene to shoes taken from the search of his residence.Â  Moreover, Hinson\r\n  explained some of the items recovered from Goodwin's residence were items\r\n  stolen in another burglary incident on Lake Shore Drive.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  officers told Goodwin that the jury would consider his cooperation because at\r\n  trial, the prosecutor would ask them if he was cooperative.Â  Barton attempted\r\n  to push Goodwin to confess to murder, stating:Â  &quot;using your logic and your\r\n  reality, okay, that life sentence, you going to get it anyway, right?&quot;Â \r\n  Barton also tried to get Goodwin to confess by saying the shooting was an\r\n  accident:Â  &quot;And your momma and daddy don't have to deal with the fact they\r\n  raised somebody that killed somebody in cold blood, shot him in the back of the\r\n  head.&quot;Â  Barton stated:\r\n\r\n  [Y]ou're\r\n    telling me, that your [sic] cooked anyway, that your [sic] going to get life\r\n    one way or the other.Â  It's time you start thinking about the other people in\r\n    your life.Â  And I, I'm using your logic, I'm not putting this on you.Â  I'm not\r\n    saying that's what I think.Â  I'm just saying using your own, using your own\r\n    words, if you're done anyways, you need to start thinking about the people in\r\n    your life.Â  [Because] your daddy said that today, he said Lord, I can't even\r\n    leave out my house.Â  You got two boys.Â  What they going to think?Â  Daddy's a\r\n    murderer or daddy did some bad things in life and some shit happened bad and he\r\n    had to do what he had to do.Â  It was him or, or me.Â  There's a big difference.\r\n\r\nAt this point in\r\n  the interrogation, Goodwin began to ask the officers about a plea bargain.Â \r\n  Hinson instructed Goodwin only the solicitor's office could offer a plea\r\n  bargain, but stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  I mean,\r\n    but there's no plea bargain I can see.Â  I mean there's, there's really no room\r\n    except for maybe life to, [I] mean from a death penalty to life without a\r\n    chance of parole . . . but I can't say.Â  We don't have the authority to make\r\n    that but I, but I can assure you it won't go any lower than that.Â  There's no\r\n    way.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  You, in\r\n    fact you really think they going to plea bargain on something like that\r\n    [(murder)].Â  I mean, I ain't even going to sit here and try to tell you\r\n    something that you, you know.Â  That ain't going to happen.Â  I mean, but when it\r\n    comes down to was he cooperative, was he not, it can make a difference on where\r\n    you're going.Â  What happens with you when you get to SCDC.Â  Those types of\r\n    things can, can always be worked out.\r\n\r\nFinally, Goodwin admitted to\r\n  shooting Dillard, and claimed Dillard startled him while he was robbing the\r\n  house.Â  Goodwin also stated he flushed all the jewelry he stole down the\r\n  toilet, and got rid of the guns.Â  The officers then asked Goodwin to handwrite\r\n  a statement, and Goodwin declined.Â  However, Goodwin did agree to sign a typed\r\n  statement, and also admitted to taking a television and cigar box from the\r\n  other burglarized house on Lake Shore Drive.Â Â Â  \r\nAs a result, the\r\n  officers took Goodwin across the hall into their offices and typed a\r\n  statement.Â  According to Barton and Hinson, the three discussed the burglary\r\n  and murder in more detail, typed and printed the statement, and Goodwin read\r\n  over the statement and signed it.Â  Additionally, Goodwin admitted the boots\r\n  found during the search of his residence were the boots he wore during the\r\n  burglary.Â  Goodwin asked the officers if he could make a phone call and called\r\n  his girlfriend. Â The officers overheard him say, &quot;It's all over.Â  They\r\n  know everything.&quot;Â  \r\nThe next day, Officers\r\n  Hinson and Barton visited Goodwin at the jail to discuss the location of the\r\n  missing guns because they were having trouble finding them.Â  Goodwin was not\r\n  re-advised of his rights.Â  The officers returned the next day and took Goodwin\r\n  out of jail to point out the exact location where he disposed of the guns.Â  \r\nDuring pretrial\r\n  motions, Goodwin argued the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him\r\n  because the only evidence they had was the DNA match on the cigar butt, which\r\n  did not amount to probable cause for an arrest.Â  The State maintained the cigar\r\n  butt placed Goodwin within inches of the point of entry where a house was\r\n  burgled and a man was fatally shot; thus, there was probable cause because the\r\n  officers believed Goodwin was guilty of a felony.Â  Goodwin contended the cigar\r\n  butt did not place him inside the house, and the palm print was not matched to\r\n  his until much later.Â  The trial court found probable cause existed for Goodwin's\r\n  arrest based on the cigar butt containing his DNA found so close to the point\r\n  of entry.Â  \r\nNext, a Jackson\r\n  v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), hearing was held to determine the\r\n  admissibility of Goodwin's statements.Â  Hinson testified he informed Goodwin of\r\n  his constitutional rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\r\n  (1966), using the form on his computer.Â  Hinson stated he believed Goodwin was\r\n  not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, seemed coherent, seemed to\r\n  understand what he was saying to the officers, and seemed to understand the\r\n  circumstances of the interrogation.Â  Hinson maintained the interrogation lasted\r\n  seventy minutes.Â  Additionally, Hinson contended Goodwin never invoked his\r\n  right to remain silent or asked to speak to an attorney. \r\nBarton testified\r\n  Goodwin was coherent, understood what was going on, responded appropriately,\r\n  was advised of his rights, and signed the Miranda waiver.Â  Barton also\r\n  stated Goodwin never asked for an attorney or to stop the questioning, and he\r\n  and Hinson did not threaten or coerce Goodwin, or promise him anything in\r\n  return for his statement.Â  \r\nThe State argued it\r\n  proved the voluntariness of the statement through the officers' testimony which\r\n  was corroborated by the audio tape where Goodwin was advised of his rights,\r\n  stated he understood his rights, and signed the waiver.Â  The State defended the\r\n  officers' discussion of the death penalty and asserted the officers' statements\r\n  were that they did not have authority to make any kind of plea deal with\r\n  Goodwin.Â  Additionally, the State maintained the officers' encouraging Goodwin\r\n  to tell the truth was not equivalent to promising Goodwin something in exchange\r\n  for a confession.Â  Moreover, the State contended there was a continuation\r\n  between the six statements, and Goodwin never asked to end the two questionings\r\n  at the police station and the follow-up questionings at the jail.Â  \r\nGoodwin conceded he never requested an attorney.Â \r\n  However, he maintained his statement, &quot;let me think about this,&quot;\r\n  invoked his right to remain silent.Â  Additionally, Goodwin argued his will was\r\n  overborne because the officers were lying to him about the evidence, bringing\r\n  up his family's perception, and discussing the death penalty.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Goodwin pointed out he was never re-advised of his constitutional rights after\r\n  the first audio-taped interrogation.Â  \r\nIn reply, the State\r\n  argued the officers were trying to find out the truth, were not overbearing,\r\n  and, while Goodwin said he would listen and did not expressly state he would\r\n  converse, he signed the Miranda waiver indicating he was willing to\r\n  talk.Â  The trial court found by the preponderance of the evidence the initial\r\n  waiver was voluntarily and knowingly made, there was no coercion and no\r\n  promises made, and there was no evidence Goodwin's will was overborne.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court admitted all six statements,[2] finding they were all a continuation and Goodwin never invoked his right to\r\n  remain silent.Â  \r\nDuring the State's closing argument, the solicitor\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  Do you\r\n    remember I asked Special Agent Barton on the stand, this is about the audiotape\r\n    and about the interview, subsequent interviews:Â  Question, &quot;Through all\r\n    your extensive training in the area, is there anything that you did, or anybody\r\n    did, in interrogation of the defendant in this case that's not accepted\r\n    interview procedure.?&quot; . . . Special Agent Barton, &quot;Nothing, Nothing.&quot;\r\n    . . . Uncontradicted testimony.\r\n\r\nGoodwin objected, arguing the\r\n  State impermissibly shifted the burden of proof.Â  The trial court overruled the\r\n  objection.Â  After the State finished its closing argument, Goodwin moved for a\r\n  mistrial based on the burden shifting objection.Â  The trial court responded:Â  &quot;I\r\n  don't believe that the comment made during the closing rises to the level of burden\r\n  shifting.Â  The motion was denied, but your position is stated on the record.&quot;Â  \r\nBefore the court\r\n  charged the jury, Goodwin took exception to the charge that the waiver of the\r\n  right to remain silent is a permanent one.Â  The trial court acknowledged Goodwin's\r\n  objection, stating it would allow him to take exception once the charge was\r\n  given.Â  Accordingly, the trial court charged the jury extensively on the\r\n  voluntariness of statements, how much weight to afford statements during\r\n  deliberation, and the State's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\n  the statement was given freely and voluntarily.Â  The jury convicted Goodwin as\r\n  charged, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of\r\n  parole.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\n&quot;In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  Thus, an appellate\r\n  court is bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Admissibility of Goodwin's\r\n  Statements\r\nGoodwin\r\n  argues the trial court abused its discretion in admitting his statements into\r\n  evidence, asserting various arguments.Â  We address each argument individually.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when\r\n  the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\n  controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  &quot;When reviewing a trial judge's ruling\r\n  concerning voluntariness, the appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts\r\n  based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply\r\n  determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by any evidence.&quot;Â  State v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 378-79, 652 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).\r\nWhen\r\n  seeking to introduce a confession, the State must prove that the statement was\r\n  voluntary and taken in compliance with Miranda.Â  State v. Middleton,\r\n  288 S.C. 21, 25, 339 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1986).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  test of voluntariness is whether a defendant's will was overborne by the\r\n  circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession.Â  Dickerson v. U.S.,\r\n  530 U.S. 428, 434 (2000).Â  When considering the voluntariness of a statement,\r\n  the court and jury should consider &quot;not only the crucial element of police\r\n  coercion; the length of the interrogation; its location; its continuity; the\r\n  defendant's maturity; education; physical condition; and mental health.&quot;Â Â  Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 693 (1993) (omitting internal\r\n  citations).Â  Misrepresentations of evidence by police, although a relevant\r\n  factor, do not render an otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible.Â  Frazier\r\n    v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 739 (1969).Â  &quot;Coercion is determined from the\r\n  perspective of the suspect.&quot;Â  Miller, 375 S.C. at 386, 652 S.E.2d\r\n  at 452.\r\nThe\r\n  question of whether law enforcement complied with the requirements of Miranda is for the court, not the jury.Â  State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 342, 422\r\n  S.E.2d 133, 143 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v.\r\n    State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999).Â  &quot;Once the court\r\n  determines that a defendant received and understood his rights, the court\r\n  allows a confession into evidence.&quot;Â  Davis, 309 S.C. at 342, 422\r\n  S.E.2d at 143.Â  &quot;It then is for the jury ultimately to decide whether the\r\n  confession was voluntary.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nAlthough the court must make the initial determination\r\n  of admissibility, the trial court must instruct the jury that it cannot\r\n  consider any confession unless it finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\n  accused gave his statement freely and voluntarily under the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Davis, 309 S.C. at 342-43, 422 S.E.2d at 143.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  An\r\n  express waiver is unnecessary to support a finding that the defendant has\r\n  waived his or her Miranda rights.Â  State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C.\r\n  426, 429, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998).Â  Once a voluntary waiver is made, it\r\n  continues until the individual being questioned indicates he wants to revoke\r\n  the waiver and remain silent or circumstances exist which establish that his\r\n  will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically\r\n  impaired.Â  State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 246\r\n  (1990).\r\n\r\n  a. Overborne Will\r\n\r\nGoodwin\r\n  maintains the trial court abused its discretion by admitting his statements\r\n  into evidence when the officers created an environment that caused his will to\r\n  be overborne.Â  We disagree.\r\nHere, Goodwin maintains his will was overborne by the\r\n  culmination of police tactics used during his interrogation.Â  Specifically, he\r\n  cites the officers' lying about evidence, threatening inappropriate and\r\n  unjustifiable police action against his family members, strongly suggesting\r\n  they could influence the State's decision to seek the death penalty, and\r\n  numerous emotional appeals relating to his family.Â  \r\nWhen considering\r\n  the Withrow factors to determine the voluntariness of Goodwin's\r\n  statement, we find the trial court properly admitted Goodwin's statements.Â \r\n  Goodwin evidenced his knowledge of the judicial system in the audio taped\r\n  interview when he initiated a conversation about his probable sentence.Â  The\r\n  initial interrogation lasted seventy minutes, and Goodwin was offered food,\r\n  drink, and the opportunity to use the facilities.Â  Moreover, the first four\r\n  statements were at the police station, in an interview room and in the officers'\r\n  offices.Â  The fifth interview was at the jail, and the sixth was during an\r\n  excursion from jail.Â  Furthermore, the questioning was at the most a continuous\r\n  seventy minutes, and while there were six individual statements, all occurred\r\n  within a three-day period.Â  At no time during the three days did Goodwin state\r\n  he wished to stop the questioning, and he never requested an attorney.Â  Finally,\r\n  no evidence exists to suggest Goodwin was suffering from a mental or physical\r\n  condition.Â  \r\nWhile we do not\r\n  condone the officers' statements regarding their evidence and Goodwin's family,\r\n  we do not find they overbore Goodwin's will.Â  The\r\n  argument that the officers' had influence over the State's decision to seek the\r\n  death penalty is factually without merit for two reasons:Â  Goodwin initiated\r\n  the discussion about sentencing and the death penalty, and the officers\r\n  repeatedly stated that they had no influence over plea negotiations.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find the officers did not create an environment that caused Goodwin's will\r\n  be to overborne, and when viewing the totality of the circumstances surrounding\r\n  Goodwin's statements, evidence exists to support the trial court's\r\n  determination that the statements were voluntary.\r\n\r\n  b. Right to Remain Silent\r\n\r\nGoodwin\r\n  argues the trial court abused its discretion by admitting his statements into\r\n  evidence because the State failed to:Â  (i) show by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that he voluntarily waived his right to remain silent; and (ii)\r\n  scrupulously honor his invocation of his right to remain silent.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    i. Preponderance of the\r\n      Evidence\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121,\r\n  126 n.1, 644 S.E.2d 693, 696 n.1 (2007).Â  Because this issue was never raised\r\n  to the trial court, it is unpreserved for our review.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    ii. Failure to Honor Goodwin's\r\n      Invocation of his Right to Remain Silent\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  examining the record, we do not find an instance where Goodwin invoked his\r\n  right to remain silent.Â  Goodwin argues his statements during the audio-taped\r\n  interrogation that he would listen and he wanted some time to think about a\r\n  question, invoked his right to remain silent.Â  We find when the statements are\r\n  viewed in context, and with their surrounding dialogue, they do not indicate he\r\n  invoked his right to remain silent.Â  Accordingly, evidence supports the trial\r\n  court's admission of the statements.\r\n\r\n  c. Fruit of an Arrest without\r\n    Probable Cause\r\n\r\nGoodwin\r\n  contends the trial court erred in admitting his statement into evidence because\r\n  the statement was the fruit of an arrest unsupported by probable cause.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  an arrest must be supported by probable cause to believe that a crime has been\r\n  committed and that the person to be arrested committed the crime.Â  Tennessee\r\n    v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 7 (1985).Â  The standard for an arrest is probable\r\n  cause, defined in terms of facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a\r\n  prudent man in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing an\r\n  offense.Â  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111 (1975).\r\nHere, a cigar butt\r\n  with Goodwin's DNA was discovered within inches of the point of entry to a\r\n  house that had been burglarized.Â  These facts and circumstances are sufficient\r\n  to warrant a prudent person in believing Goodwin committed the burglary.Â \r\n  Accordingly, evidence supports the trial court's findings and we find the trial\r\n  court properly determined there was probable cause for Goodwin's arrest, and properly\r\n  admitted his statements which arose therefrom.\r\nII. Mistrial\r\nGoodwin\r\n  asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial because the\r\n  State's closing argument impermissibly shifted the burden of proof regarding\r\n  his statement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court.Â  State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;The court's discretion will not be overturned on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest\r\n  caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes stated\r\n  into the record by the trial court.Â  Id. at 34, 615 S.E.2d at 460.Â  &quot;The\r\n  granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken\r\n  only where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in\r\n  no other way.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;A mistrial should only be granted when 'absolutely\r\n  necessary,' and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in\r\n  order to be entitled to a mistrial.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;'The less than\r\n  lucid test is therefore declared to be whether the mistrial was dictated by\r\n  manifest necessity or the ends of public justice.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting State\r\n    v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 33, 301 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1983)).Â  &quot;'Whether a\r\n  mistrial is manifestly necessary is a fact specific inquiry.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 457, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000)).\r\nA\r\n  trial court is allowed broad discretion in dealing with the range and propriety\r\n  of closing argument to the jury.Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184,\r\n  195-96, 562 S.E.2d 320, 325 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Ordinarily, the court's rulings\r\n  on such matters will not be disturbed.Â  Id. at 196, 562 S.E.2d at\r\n  325-26.Â  An appellate court must review the argument in the context of the\r\n  entire record.Â  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766\r\n  (1997).Â  &quot;The relevant question is whether the solicitor's comments so\r\n  infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial\r\n  of due process.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHere, the State's\r\n  closing argument did not present the requisite urgent circumstances for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  The comment was not so grievous that its alleged prejudicial effect\r\n  could not be removed in any other way.Â  After reviewing the record in its\r\n  entirety, we do not believe the solicitor's comments so infected the trial with\r\n  unfairness as to make Goodwin's conviction a denial of due process.Â  Moreover,\r\n  any alleged error was cured by the trial court's extensive jury charge on\r\n  voluntariness of statements, and the State's burden to prove voluntariness of a\r\n  statement beyond a reasonable doubt.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly denied Goodwin's mistrial motion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not err in admitting Goodwin's\r\n  statements and properly denied Goodwin's mistrial motion.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Goodwin's DNA was in the police database C.O.D.I.S.\r\n[2] The six statements were:\r\n\r\n  1. Audio taped interrogation at the\r\n    police station.\r\n  2. Written statement at the police\r\n    station.\r\n  3. Statement admitting the boots\r\n    recovered at his residence were the ones he wore during the burglary and\r\n    murder.\r\n  4. Overheard statement to his\r\n    girlfriend on the phone:Â  &quot;It's all over.Â  They know everything.&quot;\r\n  5. Written statement taken the day\r\n    after his arrest while he was in jail.\r\n  6. Statement taken two days after his\r\n    arrest when he was taken out of jail by the officers to identify the location\r\n    of the guns.\r\n\r\n[3] The trial court charged:Â  &quot;The State must prove\r\n  the voluntariness of a statement beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  If you determine\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that a statement was given freely and voluntarily,\r\n  then you may give the statement such further consideration as you deem proper.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4572","title":"Watt v.

Â Dr. Ware\r\n  had Watt admitted to Anderson Memorial Hospital for a heart catherization,\r\n  which showed three blockages.Â  Watt was transferred to Greenville Hospital,\r\n  where he had triple by-pass surgery.Â  Since that time, Watt has been unable to\r\n  work by doctor's orders.Â  \r\nWatt has had heart\r\n  problems and has been under the care of a cardiologist since 1991.Â  He has been\r\n  diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic disease and congestive cardiomyopathy.Â \r\n  In addition, he has chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia.Â  \r\nWatt filed this\r\n  workers' compensation action claiming he suffered an accidental injury to his\r\n  heart and cardiovascular system, which culminated in total disability on or\r\n  about January 30, 2001.Â  He asserted Piedmont Honda's implementation of a &quot;Net\r\n  Profit&quot; program in January of 2000 produced an extraordinary working\r\n  condition causing him stress that aggravated his cardiovascular disease and\r\n  caused the blockage of his coronary arteries.Â  Employers denied the claim.Â  The\r\n  single commissioner held that pursuant to section 42-1-160 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, Watt did not sustain a personal injury because he failed to\r\n  establish the stressful employment conditions causing the injury were\r\n  extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the normal conditions of employment.\r\n  Â The commissioner held that Watt suffered from angina on the date of his\r\n  alleged injury and angina is not compensable because it did not cause any\r\n  disability.Â  The commissioner found Watt's claim was barred by the notice\r\n  provision of section 42-15-20 of the South Carolina Code because he failed to\r\n  notify Employers of a work-related accident within ninety days from the date of\r\n  the alleged accident.Â  Finally, the commissioner ruled an employer/employee\r\n  relationship did not exist on the date of the alleged accident, January 31,\r\n  2001.Â  The Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission affirmed.Â \r\n  The circuit court, however, reversed on all grounds.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes our standard of review of decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission. Accordingly, this court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panel's\r\n  decision only if the appellant's substantial rights have been prejudiced\r\n  because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Â Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2008); Shealy v. Aiken County, 341\r\n  S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a\r\n  mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such\r\n  evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.&quot;Â  Shealy,\r\n  341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two\r\n  inconsistent conclusions does not prevent the Appellate Panel's conclusions\r\n  from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care\r\n    Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).Â  The final determination\r\n  of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to\r\nthe Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  1. Injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment\r\n\r\nEmployers\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in determining Watt suffered an injury by\r\n  accident arising out of and in the course of employment when Watt was not\r\n  subjected to unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  We agree.\r\nAn\r\n  employee may recover workers' compensation benefits if he sustains an &quot;injury\r\n  by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.&quot; S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2008); Jordan v. Kelly Co., 381 S.C. 483, 486,\r\n  674 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2009); Section 42-1-160(C) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2008) provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  Stress, mental injuries, heart attacks,\r\n    strokes, embolisms, or aneurisms arising out of and in the course of employment\r\n    unaccompanied by physical injury are not considered compensable if they result\r\n    from any event or series of events which are incidental to normal\r\n    employer/employee relations including, but not limited to, personnel actions by\r\n    the employer such as disciplinary actions, work evaluations, transfers,\r\n    promotions, demotions, salary reviews, or terminations, except when these\r\n    actions are taken in an extraordinary and unusual manner.\r\n\r\n&quot;The general rule is\r\n  that a heart attack is compensable as a worker's compensation accident if it is\r\n  induced by unexpected strain or overexertion in the performance of the duties\r\n  of a claimant's employment or by unusual and extraordinary conditions of\r\n  employment.&quot; Â Jordan, 381 S.C. at 486, 674 S.E.2d at 168. \r\nIn Jordan,\r\n  the employee, a truck driver, suffered a heart attack following a long haul\r\n  route from Virginia to Texas. Â 381 S.C. at 484, 674 S.E.2d at 167.Â  The\r\n  employee contended he was entitled to workers' compensation benefits because\r\n  his heart attack was proximately caused by unusual and extraordinary duties of\r\n  the long haul, which included a seven hour departure delay, having to leave\r\n  without the necessary permits until he could pick up faxed copies at a truck\r\n  stop, and not being able to take the exit his permit required him to take and\r\n  therefore having to drive through downtown Houston, barely making the extended\r\n  deadline.Â  Id. at 485, 674 S.E.2d at 167-68.Â  Although the Appellate\r\n  Panel denied the employee compensation, the circuit court reversed.Â  The\r\n  supreme court found the circuit court's decision was in error.Â  The court noted\r\n  that while the employee testified the haul was very stressful, his boss and\r\n  co-worker testified that the employer did not impose deadlines and it was not\r\n  unusual for employees to deviate from their routes due to construction.Â  The\r\n  employee admitted that he had left without permits on prior deliveries and then\r\n  picked up faxed copies at the nearest truck stop.Â  In addition, the employee\r\n  had several risk factors for heart attacks:Â  he smoked cigarettes, abused\r\n  alcohol, suffered from high blood pressure, and had a family history of heart\r\n  disease.Â  Id. at 486-87, 674 S.E.2d at 168-69. \r\nThe\r\n  supreme court held that while the record contained conflicting evidence, it was\r\n  not in a position to weigh the evidence presented in a workers' compensation\r\n  hearing. Â Id. at 487, 674 S.E.2d at 169. Â Thus, the supreme court ruled\r\n  substantial evidence supported the Appellate Panel's finding that the employee's\r\n  heart attack was not induced by unexpected strain or overexertion in the\r\n  performance of the duties of his employment or by unusual and extraordinary\r\n  conditions of employment.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the Appellate Panel held Watt's disability was caused by his underlying\r\n  coronary artery disease and his cardiomyopathy, both of which he had for\r\n  several years.Â  Dr. Ware, Watt's cardiologist, testified that angina did not\r\n  damage Watt's heart, but rather was a warning about the insufficiency of blood\r\n  supply to the heart caused by the underlying heart disease. Â There is no\r\n  question that Watt has suffered from heart conditions during the prior decade.Â \r\n  Watt first saw Dr. Ware in June of 1991 for unstable angina pectoris.Â  A\r\n  cardiac catheterization at that time showed a high grade obstruction of his right\r\n  coronary artery.Â  He had angioplasty as a result.Â  In the mid-1990s, he\r\n  developed congestive heart failure and poor left ventricle function.Â  Dr. Ware\r\n  felt that Watt had developed a second condition, congestive cardiomyopathy.Â \r\n  Watt was treated medically and was instructed to follow certain dietary\r\n  restrictions, lose weight, exercise more, and limit his stress at work.Â \r\n  However, as Dr. Ware noted, Watt was unable to comply with any of these\r\n  instructions.Â  In addition to the heart conditions, Watt suffered from\r\n  gastroesophageal reflux, anxiety, and depression.Â  He has numerous risk factors\r\n  for coronary artery disease including obesity, hyperlipidemia, and\r\n  hypertension.Â  Dr. Ware noted these factors were difficult to control because\r\n  of Watt having difficulty with compliance with medical directions.Â  In\r\n  addition, Watt has a family history of heart disease.Â  \r\nWatt asserts the\r\n  unusual stress and strain and/or extraordinary conditions in his workplace\r\n  aggravated his prior existing coronary artery disease, which resulted in total\r\n  disability.Â  Dr. Ware opined that stress contributed to a progression of Watt's\r\n  coronary artery disease, along with other factors. Â Watt testified that\r\n  Piedmont Honda's implementation of the Net Profit system in January of 2000\r\n  placed extraordinary stress on him.Â  He claimed the system redesigned the whole\r\n  service process resulting in double the paper work and much longer hours for\r\n  him.Â  He stated he went to work before daylight and would work until 8:00 or\r\n  9:00 at night.Â  He related that the new system angered the customers and he\r\n  would have to handle their complaints.Â  He also had to call the customers at\r\n  night and would sometimes take the list of customers home with him to complete\r\n  his calls.Â  During the year of Net Profit's implementation, Watt had more chest\r\n  pains and felt tired.Â  He was depressed because the new system was not working\r\n  well, upsetting the technicians as well as the customers and he had to handle\r\n  their complaints.Â  Watt stated he was told he would be fired if he did not\r\n  implement the new system.Â  Sean Parkhurst, a former employee of Piedmont Honda,\r\n  similarly testified that the implementation of the Net Profit system doubled\r\n  Watt's work.Â  He stated Watt always appeared tired and worked late every night. \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, Gary Billy Vinson, the shop foreman and assistant service manager at\r\n  Piedmont Honda, testified the Net Profit system merely changed the way\r\n  customers were greeted and the way repair orders were written. Â He stated it\r\n  did not change the amount of work needed or cause Watt to work extra hours,\r\n  other than a 45 minute meeting once a week. Â Vinson, who handled customer\r\n  complaints when Watt was not there, testified the system did not upset the\r\n  customers.Â  He stated that while not all of the employees liked the new system,\r\n  some did. \r\nSimilarly, Jeff\r\n  Searcy, the general manager of Piedmont Automotive, testified the Net Profit\r\n  system did not change anything other than the way customers were greeted and\r\n  the way repair orders were written.Â  He stated the implementation of Net Profit\r\n  would not have necessitated Watt having to stay and work until 9:00 at night.Â \r\n  He denied threatening to fire Watt if he did not implement the new system.Â \r\n  William Dial, Piedmont Honda's Chief Financial Officer, testified that his\r\n  office looked directly into Watt's office.Â  He stated he usually left the\r\n  office between 7:00 and 8:00 at night and rarely saw Watt still in his office\r\n  when he left.Â  He claimed the implementation of Net Profit would not have\r\n  necessitated Watt's having to stay late at night.Â  He denied that it created\r\n  problems or made customers unhappy. \r\nAlthough,\r\n  as in Jordan, the record contains conflicting evidence, this court may\r\n  not weigh the evidence.&nbsp; 381 S.C. at 487, 674 S.E.2d at 169 (holding &quot;that\r\n  the final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded\r\n  evidence is reserved to the [Appellate Panel], and it is not the task of an\r\n  appellate court to weigh the evidence as found by the [Appellate Panel]&quot;).Â  There is substantial evidence in the record that Watt was accustomed to\r\n  working 55 and 60 hour weeks in the years preceding the implementation.Â  In\r\n  addition, there is substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panel's\r\n  conclusion that the implementation of Net Profit did not result in unusual or\r\n  extraordinary conditions of employment for Watt or that Watt was subject to\r\n  unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment in comparison to the normal\r\n  conditions of his employment.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in\r\n  reversing the order of the Appellate Panel.Â  \r\n\r\n  2. Notice\r\n\r\nEmployers\r\n  assert the circuit court erred in reversing the Appellate Panel's determination\r\n  that Watt failed to provide adequate and timely notice.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  42-15-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) requires an injured\r\n  employee to immediately &quot;on the occurrence of an accident, or as soon\r\n  thereafter as practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer a notice\r\n  of the accident.&quot;Â  Generally, the injury is not compensable unless notice\r\n  is given within ninety days.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20(B) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  ruling Watt had satisfied the notice requirement, the circuit court found\r\n  Piedmont Honda had been aware of Watt's heart condition during his years there.Â \r\n  In addition, it held Piedmont Honda was provided notice in February 2001 when\r\n  Watt's wife informed Dial, one of Watt's supervisors, that Watt was in the\r\n  hospital and was going to have open heart surgery.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  several Piedmont employees testified that they knew of Watt's heart condition,\r\n  they did not testify that they knew he believed his heart condition to be\r\n  work-related.Â  At the hearing, Watt's wife testified that before Watt was\r\n  transferred to Greenville Hospital she went to Piedmont Honda and spoke with\r\n  Dial.Â  She told him that Watt was in the hospital and would have open heart\r\n  surgery because of the stress he had been under.Â  Sean Parkhurt, a former\r\n  employee of Piedmont Honda testified that a few days after Watt was fired, he\r\n  saw Watt's wife visit the dealership and speak to Dial.Â  Dial, however, denied\r\n  having this conversation with Mrs. Watt.Â Â  He stated he did not learn that Watt\r\n  was making a workers' compensation claim until December of 2001.Â  Dial's\r\n  testimony provides substantial evidence for the Appellate Panel's ruling that\r\n  Watt failed to provide the required notice.Â  It is the Appellate Panel, rather\r\n  than the circuit court or this court, that determines the credibility of\r\n  witnesses and resolves disputes between witnesses. See Anderson v. Baptist\r\n    Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 492-93, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001) (&quot;Where\r\n  there is a conflict in the evidence, either by different witnesses or in the\r\n  testimony of the same witness, the findings of fact of the [Appellate Panel]\r\n  are conclusive.&quot;).Â Â Â  Accordingly, the circuit court erred in reversing\r\n  the Appellate Panel on this issue.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  stated reasons, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.[1]\r\nWILLIAMS\r\nand KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At oral argument,Â  Employers conceded the issue regarding the employment\r\nrelationship at the time of the injury.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4573","title":"State v.

Vick was indicted for and\r\n  convicted of murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC), and\r\n  kidnapping.Â  The trial judge sentenced Vick to life imprisonment for murder and\r\n  thirty years each for CSC and kidnapping.Â  Vick appeals, arguing (1) the trial\r\n  court erred in allowing hearsay testimony from a witness regarding a telephone\r\n  conversation between the victim and appellant's mother and (2) his kidnapping sentence should be\r\n    vacated pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910.Â  We affirm in part\r\n  and vacate in part. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis case involves the murder of Dana (hereinafter Victim), a\r\n  twenty-seven year old mother of two who was found brutally beaten and strangled\r\n  on July 31, 1995 inside the beauty salon she owned. Â Patty Taylor testified she\r\n  arrived at Victim's salon at 6:30 in the evening on July 31, 1995 for a hair\r\n  appointment.Â  After she arrived, a woman selling a cleaning product made aÂ \r\n  demonstration to her and Victim, and Victim purchased a bottle of the item from\r\n  the woman.Â  Thereafter, Victim began working on Taylor's hair a little before\r\n  7:00 and finished around 8:00.Â  During this time, Victim also swept and cleaned\r\n  her shop.Â  After Taylor paid her, Victim walked Taylor to the door.Â  Victim\r\n  told Taylor she had some clothes in the dryer, and when Taylor offered to stay\r\n  with her until she locked up the shop, Victim declined, stating she would be\r\n  right behind her as she only had five minutes left for the clothes.Â  Taylor\r\n  estimated she left the shop at 8:10 or 8:15. \r\nWitness Diane Harris, who lived in Charlotte, was in the area of the\r\n  beauty salon on the day of Victim's death, selling an all purpose cleaning\r\n  product door-to-door.Â  Harris went to Victim's salon around 6:30 or 6:40 and,\r\n  after giving Victim a demonstration of her product, completed a sale with\r\n  Victim around 6:50.Â  Harris was scheduled to meet back at a designated spot at\r\n  8:30 and was to be the last salesperson picked up before travelling back to\r\n  Charlotte.Â  After leaving Victim's shop, Harris walked around the area making\r\n  calls on different houses.Â  Around 8:10, she walked back through the parking\r\n  lot of Victim's salon at which time she saw Victim through the window of the\r\n  salon and spoke to Victim.Â  Victim appeared to be cleaning and waved at\r\n  Harris.Â  Harris continued on her quest to sell her product and headed back to\r\n  her pick-up spot at 8:30.Â  As she reached the parking lot of the salon, she\r\n  noticed the lights were on in the salon, but the window blinds were now down.Â \r\n  At that time, she heard thumping sounds.Â  When she looked around, she observed\r\n  a man coming out of the salon window.Â  Startled, Harris ran, leaving all her\r\n  belongings behind.Â  As she ran around the building in one direction, the man\r\n  ran in the other, and the two came face to face on the other side of the\r\n  building.Â  Harris then ran out to the street and screamed.Â  She ran into a\r\n  home, locked the door, and told the residents to call 9-1-1, screaming that\r\n  Victim needed help.Â  Harris testified the man she saw coming out of the window\r\n  and again at the back of the building &quot;was white and looked crazy.&quot;Â \r\n  He was wearing a gray or white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans, and appeared\r\n  to be between twenty and thirty years-old.\r\nAnother witness observed a woman and man in the area of the salon fitting\r\n  the description of Harris and the man Harris described encountering that\r\n  night.Â  Around 8:30 in the evening on July 31, 1995, Michael Crook was driving\r\n  towards Spartanburg when he observed a black woman walking and then saw a white\r\n  male, who was bent down and was looking back toward Victim's salon.Â  The man was\r\n  wearing &quot;grayish colored blue jeans and a grayish colored t-shirt.&quot;\r\nAdditionally, witness Jerry Mills testified he was familiar with Victim's\r\n  salon, which was located in the same area as his place of employment.Â  Mills\r\n  stated that he drove by the area around 5:00 or 5:30 on the afternoon of July\r\n  31, 1995 and did not notice anything out of the ordinary.Â  However, just before\r\n  dusk as he drove back through, he observed a Ford Bronco parked in a place where\r\n  his employer did not allow parking.Â  None of Mills' co-employees drove a\r\n  vehicle like that.Â  Mills pulled up closer to the car to investigate further\r\n  but found no one around the vehicle.Â  He described the Bronco as a late 1980's\r\n  car, blue with a white or light cream colored top, and with &quot;nice rims&quot;\r\n  on the tires that did not look like factory rims, and may have been called\r\n  razor rims.\r\nSpartanburg County Sheriff's Deputy John Todd Burnett received a call\r\n  reporting a breaking and entering on July 31, 1995 at approximately 8:45 or\r\n  8:50 p.m., and arrived on the scene at Roebuck Beauty and Tanning Salon shortly\r\n  before 9:00.Â  Deputy Burnett found the only door to the establishment partially\r\n  cracked and a screen from a window on the ground, with the window open.Â \r\n  Inside, the deputy discovered the body of a twenty-seven year-old female in a\r\n  bathroom/washroom.Â  Victim was hanging from a strap around her neck which was\r\n  connected to a hot water heater.Â  She had blood in her hair and on her face,\r\n  she had cuts and bruises on her face, and her tongue appeared to protrude from\r\n  her mouth.Â  A white t-shirt on the top of her body was covered with blood, and\r\n  she was nude from the top portion of her waist down, with her pants on her left\r\n  ankle.\r\nInvestigation of the scene revealed all of the blood was contained to the\r\n  bathroom area where Victim was found.Â  This room showed evidence a struggle had\r\n  taken place therein.Â  Victim's pocketbook, wallet, and checkbook were discovered\r\n  in the salon, as well as the business cashbox and checkbook.Â  The wallet and\r\n  cashbox together contained over $200 in cash. Â Â Â Â \r\nThe pathologist who performed an autopsy on Victim noted she had a deep\r\n  abrasion on her forehead as well as other superficial abrasions and numerous\r\n  contusions about her head, neck, upper chest, elbows, arm, wrist, knees, and\r\n  ankle.Â  Victim's hyoid bone appeared fractured, indicating considerable\r\n  pressure had been applied. This usually occurs from manual strangulation but\r\n  could have been caused by a ligature.Â  The pathologist believed Victim was\r\n  probably strangled manually, as well as with the use of a ligature.Â  Examination\r\n  of Victim's brain also revealed extensive hemorrhaging caused by blunt force\r\n  trauma.\r\nDavid Michael Pace testified that he became a friend of appellant Vick in\r\n  1994 when they were in high school.Â  Pace worked at a bowling alley and Vick\r\n  would come by the place of business about twice a month, usually on Friday or\r\n  Saturday nights.Â  The last time Vick visited Pace at the bowling alley was on a\r\n  Monday evening at the end of July in 1995.Â  At that time, Vick was wearing blue\r\n  jeans and a light colored shirt.Â  Vick talked to Pace about a lady named Dana,\r\n  and the fact that he was going to ask her out that night.Â  Vick had previously\r\n  spoken about Dana to Pace on a couple of occasions, telling Pace that Dana was\r\n  a hairdresser who cut his hair and complimenting Dana's looks.Â  On that Monday\r\n  night at the end of July, Vick told Pace that Dana was having problems with her\r\n  husband and he was going to ask Dana out and hoped she would agree to date him.\r\n  Â Pace laughed at the idea because Dana was an older woman and he thought Vick\r\n  was too young for her.Â  Vick then became defensive and angry at Pace's\r\n  reaction, stating he believed he had a chance with her.Â  Vick stated that he\r\n  hoped Dana would say yes to his date proposal, and graphically described to\r\n  Pace how he would &quot;bend her over her barber chair&quot; and perform sexual\r\n  acts on her.Â  He further stated other sexual conduct he would like to have take\r\n  place with Dana.\r\nAfter talking for close to an hour, Vick agreed to give Pace a ride home.Â \r\n  During the drive, Vick, who was very serious about his intentions with Dana, &quot;kept\r\n  defending himself&quot; and was upset that Pace had laughed at him.Â  Vick\r\n  dropped Pace off around 6:45 or 7:00 p.m.Â  As Pace exited the vehicle, Vick\r\n  told him he was going to get his hair cut.Â  When Pace asked who would cut his\r\n  hair that late at night, Vick responded that Dana kept her salon open late at\r\n  night and she knew he was coming.Â  Pace described the vehicle Vick drove that\r\n  night as a blue and white Ford Bronco with distinctive saw blade wheels.\r\nThe next time Pace saw Vick was a few days later at a pool hall.Â  Pace\r\n  stated Vick walked up and &quot;bumped into [him] in a serious manner.&quot;\r\n  Vick then told Pace &quot;if I tell anybody he would kill me.&quot;Â  When Pace\r\n  asked what he was talking about, Vick said that Pace knew, or he would find out.Â \r\n  A couple of days to weeks after the incident at the pool hall, Pace realized\r\n  what Vick did not want him to discuss when he saw a report on the news that\r\n  described a vehicle similar to Vick's and showed a sketch that closely\r\n  resembled Vick.[1]Â \r\n  Approximately three months after the murder, Pace anonymously provided\r\n  authorities the name of a possible suspect.Â  Pace contacted law enforcement a\r\n  second time after the murder was featured on a television program, again\r\n  remaining anonymous.Â  On a third occasion, during an unrelated incident at the\r\n  bowling alley, Pace informed an officer he might know who was responsible for\r\n  Victim's murder and gave the officer a name, but he still did not give the\r\n  officer his own name.Â  Finally, in 2005 Pace had someone again contact law\r\n  enforcement on his behalf.Â  Eventually he came forward and informed the\r\n  authorities of the information he relayed to the jury.\r\nSLED Agent Lilly Gallman, an expert in the area of DNA and serology,\r\n  testified she processed the crime scene for body fluids.Â  When she examined\r\n  Victim's body with an illumilight she noted it fluoresced, indicating possible\r\n  semen in Victim's pubic hairs.Â  Remembering what she had observed at the time\r\n  she processed the scene, Agent Gallman later tested evidence from Victim's rape\r\n  kit, which contained pubic hair combings, hoping to find semen.Â  The sample\r\n  tested positive for semen, and Gallman was later able to develop a profile from\r\n  it.Â  Agent Gallman received a sample of Vick's DNA in 2005 and found his DNA\r\n  profile matched the DNA profile developed from the semen.Â  She testified the\r\n  probability of randomly selecting an unrelated individual having a DNA profile\r\n  matching the semen was approximately one in 900 million.\r\nThe State also presented evidence that in 1996, Aaron Popkin purchased a\r\n  1988 blue and white Ford Bronco with saw blade wheels owned by Vick's family.Â \r\n  Popkin testified he met with Vick at his place of employment after seeing an ad\r\n  for the car.Â  When Popkin offered to loan Vick one of his cars while his\r\n  mechanic kept the Bronco for inspection, Vick indicated to Popkin that he was\r\n  suspicious Popkin may actually be a police officer.Â  The two then worked out an\r\n  alternate arrangement for inspection of the car.\r\nThe State further presented the testimony of one of Vick's cellmates at\r\n  the local county detention center.Â  Steve Vaughn was housed in a cell with Vick\r\n  for approximately eight or nine weeks starting in February 2006.Â  Vaughn\r\n  testified that he and Vick discussed their pending charges during this time.Â \r\n  On one particular night, Vaughn recalled he had a &quot;bad phone call&quot;\r\n  from his wife and was upset.Â  In discussing the call with Vick, Vaughn asked\r\n  him whether there was anything in his life or a day in his life he would take\r\n  back if he could.Â  Vick responded it would be the day he went over to Victim's\r\n  shop.Â  Vick told Vaughn he drove his vehicle over there, but parked across the\r\n  road because Victim was married and he did not want her husband to see him or\r\n  his vehicle.Â  He further indicated he exited the building through the window\r\n  because he was scared.Â  Vick indicated he recalled having a conversation with\r\n  Victim, but he &quot;blacked out&quot; and did not recall anything else while\r\n  in the shop.\r\nThe jury found Vick guilty of murder, kidnapping, and first-degree CSC.Â \r\n  The court sentenced Vick to life imprisonment for murder, thirty years for the\r\n  CSC charge, and thirty years for kidnapping.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n1. Did the trial court err by allowing the testimony from a witness that\r\n  while Victim was doing her hair at the salon Vick's mother telephoned Victim\r\n  and asked Victim to fix Vick's hair, Victim related to the witness her\r\n  exasperation about the situation, and Victim told the witness she would not\r\n  accommodate Vick, as the testimony amounted to prejudicial hearsay since the\r\n  State's theory was that Vick sexually assaulted and killed Victim at the beauty\r\n  shop at some time not far removed from the phone call?\r\n2. Should Vick's thirty year sentence for kidnapping be vacated pursuant to\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 since he was also sentenced for murder?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law\r\n  only.Â  We are bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are\r\n  clearly erroneous. This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual\r\n  findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal\r\n  cases.&quot;Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829\r\n  (2001) (citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nVick first contends the trial court committed reversible\r\n  error in allowing the testimony of Darlene Reeves regarding a telephone\r\n  conversation she heard between Vick's mother and Victim almost one week prior\r\n  to Victim's murder.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe record reveals the State called Reeves to the stand and\r\n  questioned her about a telephone conversation she overheard between Victim and\r\n  Vick's mother, and the related conversation between Victim and Reeves after the\r\n  call ended.Â  Reeves testified that she was a customer and a friend of Victim,\r\n  and that she was in Victim's salon around Tuesday, July 25, 1995 to have her\r\n  hair cut.Â  While Reeves was in the chair, Victim received a call from Vick's\r\n  mother, Mary Ann.Â  Reeves, who was acquainted with Mary Ann Vick and had talked\r\n  to her on the telephone before, knew it was Mary Ann on the phone because\r\n  Victim was behind Reeves when the phone call came, and she recognized Mary Ann's\r\n  voice. When Reeves was asked why Mary Ann was calling, defense counsel objected\r\n  on the basis of speculation and hearsay.Â  The trial court overruled the\r\n  objection and Reeves then testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  She wanted [Victim]\r\n    to look at [Vick's] hair that, you know, I don't know if he put something on it\r\n    or had someone.Â  But she told her that it wouldn't take but about ten minutes\r\n    of her time.Â  And Mary Ann could not, excuse me, [Victim] could not do it that\r\n    day and had stated to Mary Ann that she was not able to do it but if she would\r\n    call her back, you know, it's been a timeframe, so I don't know if she said come\r\n    by there the next day or call her back.\r\n\r\nCounsel\r\n  again objected, asserting anything Victim said in the phone conversation was\r\n  hearsay.Â  The court again overruled the objection, but instructed the witness to\r\n  testify only to matters that she remembered. Â When asked what she remembered\r\n  about the conversation, Reeves stated &quot;[t]he conversation was to call back\r\n  and she would take a look at it but she could not do it that day.&quot;Â  Reeves\r\n  went on to state, &quot;I just heard the voice.Â  And when [Victim] hung up sheÂ \r\n  - - obviously Mary Ann hung up on her because there was no good-bye.Â  And\r\n  Victim turned around to me and she just, she took a breath and she said Mary\r\n  Ann Vick.&quot;Â  Counsel again objected on the basis of hearsay, at which time\r\n  a bench conference was held off the record.Â  The Solicitor then asked Reeves\r\n  what Victim told Reeves after the phone call ended.Â  Reeves stated that Victim\r\n  told her that it was Mary Ann Vick, at which point Reeves told Victim she knew\r\n  because she recognized the voice.Â  When Victim asked if Reeves knew them,\r\n  Reeves told her that she did.Â  Reeves then testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  [Victim] said to me,\r\n    she said, well, I won't do that anymore.Â  She said that the last time that he\r\n    was here that was the case, that ten minutes of your time and it took her an\r\n    hour and a half.Â  She did not have time to do it that day.\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n  counsel objected &quot;to that last statement,&quot; but was overruled without\r\n  comment.Â  Â \r\nVick maintains this testimony related in detail the substance\r\n  of what Victim told Reeves about the conversation and the situation with Vick.Â \r\n  He argues the purpose of the testimony elicited by the State was to impart to\r\n  the jury that Victim's past dealings with Vick were unpleasant, she was unhappy\r\n  with Vick and his mother, and that she was not looking forward to dealing with Vick\r\n  again.Â  Accordingly, Vick argues Reeves' testimony, coupled with Pace's\r\n  testimony of Vick's anger when Pace mocked him about his intention to date\r\n  Victim, led to the inference of a strong rebuff by Victim of any advance by Vick\r\n  and a resulting angry response by Vick. Â Â He contends this testimony was\r\n  hearsay and it was highly prejudicial.Â  Â Â Â \r\nHearsay is defined as &quot;a\r\n  statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial\r\n  or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of\r\n  evidence of an out of court statement by someone other than the person\r\n  testifying which is used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Â Watson\r\n    v. State, 370 S.C. 68, 71, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006);Â  Rhodes v. State,\r\n  349 S.C. 25, 31, 561 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2002).Â  It is well settled that evidence\r\n  is not hearsay unless offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State\r\n    v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, 451 S.E.2d 888, 894 (1994);Â  State v. Smith,\r\n  309 S.C. 442, 447, 424 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1992);Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C.\r\n  409, 420, 405 S.E.2d 377, 383 (1991); Â State v. Green, 318 S.C. 426,\r\n  429, 458 S.E.2d 73, 75 (Ct.. App. 1995).\r\nFurther, the improper admission of\r\n  hearsay testimony constitutes reversible error only when the admission causes\r\n  prejudice. Â State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 288, 625 S.E.2d 641, 646 (2006); State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 150-51 (1985).Â  Error\r\n  is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the\r\n  trial.Â  Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151. Â Appellate courts\r\n  will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the\r\n  result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597\r\n  (1991).Â  An insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is\r\n  harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such\r\n  that no other rational conclusion can be reached. Â State v. Bailey, 298\r\n  S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).Â  Additionally, the admission of improper\r\n  hearsay evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other\r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 499, 629 S.E.2d 363, 366 (2006).\r\nHere, the evidence objected to by Vick\r\n  obviously was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted and therefore,\r\n  by definition, is not hearsay.Â  As noted by the State, the conversation simply\r\n  related that Victim did not have time to fix Vick's hair at the request of Vick's\r\n  mother.Â  Clearly, this evidence was not offered for the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted, i.e. that Victim did not have time to work on Vick's hair that day.Â \r\n  If the evidence was elicited, as Vick contends, to show that Victim's past\r\n  dealings with Vick were unpleasant, she was unhappy with Vick and his mother,\r\n  and that she was not looking forward to dealing with Vick again, it was not\r\n  then elicited to show the truth of the matter asserted, that Victim did not\r\n  have time to fix Vick's hair on that particular day.\r\nFurther, even if the evidence was\r\n  improperly admitted hearsay, Vick has failed to demonstrate reversible error.Â \r\n  If the logical relevance of the evidence is, as submitted by the State, to show\r\n  Victim knew Vick and he was one of her customers, Reeves' testimony was merely\r\n  cumulative to other un-objected to testimony that Vick was a customer.Â  More\r\n  importantly, however, a review of the record shows the jury's verdict was based\r\n  on an abundance of competent evidence from which Vicks' guilt was conclusively\r\n  proven such that any error in admission of the evidence would be harmless.Â \r\n  Testimony submitted at trial shows: (1) Vick had a sexual desire to be with\r\n  Victim and intended to visit her at the salon on the night of her murder, and\r\n  Vick threatened to kill the witness who could provide this information, (2) a\r\n  person matching the description of Vick was seen exiting Victim's salon just\r\n  before Victim's brutally beaten, semi-nude body was discovered in the salon, (3)\r\n  a car very similar to Vick's in make, model, color and with distinctive rims\r\n  was seen parked in the area around the time of the murder, (4) Vick confided in\r\n  a cellmate that he wished he could take back the day he went over to Victim's\r\n  shop, that he drove his vehicle over there, parking across the road so as not\r\n  to be seen, and though he blacked out while inside the salon, he recalled\r\n  exiting the building through the window because he was scared, and (5) Vick's\r\n  DNA matched the semen left on Victim's body and the probability of randomly\r\n  selecting an unrelated individual having a DNA profile matching the semen was\r\n  approximately one in 900 million.Â  Accordingly, the admission of Reeves'\r\n  testimony was insubstantial and could not have affected the result of the trial\r\n  and therefore, if in error, was harmless.Â  \r\nVick next contends his thirty-year kidnapping sentence should\r\n  be vacated inasmuch as he was sentenced for murder and the kidnapping sentence\r\n  was therefore improper pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  State acknowledges it is error to sentence a defendant for the kidnapping of a\r\n  victim whom he is also convicted of murdering, and that when a defendant is\r\n  convicted of murder, any sentence for kidnapping of the victim should be\r\n  vacated.Â  However, the State maintains Vick failed to object to the sentence when\r\n  imposed, and the law requires a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial\r\n  in order to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Accordingly, the State\r\n  maintains, though the kidnapping sentence was error and likely will be\r\n  addressed in a separate proceeding, the issue is procedurally barred from\r\n  review and may not be addressed in a direct appeal before this court.Â  \r\nSection 16-3-910 of the South Carolina Code provides as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  Whoever shall\r\n    unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct or carry away any\r\n    other person by any means whatsoever without authority of law, except when a\r\n    minor is seized or taken by his parent, is guilty of a felony and, upon\r\n    conviction, must be imprisoned for a period not to exceed thirty years unless\r\n      sentenced for murder as provided in Section 16-3-20.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (2003) (emphasis added).Â  Our courts have long held, where\r\n  an appellant has been sentenced for murder of a victim, this code section\r\n  precludes a sentence for kidnapping of that victim, and any such sentence\r\n  should be vacated.Â  Owens v. State, 331 S.C. 582, 584-85, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  462, 463 (1998);Â  State v. McCall, 304 S.C. 465, 470, 405 S.E.2d 414,\r\n  416-17 (Ct. App. 1991), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v.\r\n    State, 336 S.C. 348, 352, 520 S.E.2d 614, 616 (1999);Â  State v.\r\n      Livingston, 282 S.C. 1, 8, 317 S.E.2d 129, 133 (1984);Â  State v. Perry,\r\n  278 S.C. 490, 495, 299 S.E.2d 324, 327 (1983);Â  State v. Copeland, 278\r\n  S.C. 572, 597, 300 S.E.2d 63, 77-78 (1982).\r\nThe\r\n  State correctly notes that our courts have held a challenge to sentencing must\r\n  be raised at trial to be preserved for appellate review.Â  See State\r\n    v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (noting our\r\n  supreme court &quot;has consistently held that a challenge to sentencing must\r\n  be raised at trial, or the issue will not be preserved for appellate review&quot;).Â \r\n  However, the State concedes that it is error to sentence a defendant for the\r\n  kidnapping of a victim whom he is also convicted of murdering, and any such\r\n  sentence for kidnapping should be vacated.Â  The State further recognizes that\r\n  the issue, if determined to be unreviewable on direct appeal, will in all\r\n  likelihood be addressed in a post-conviction relief proceeding.Â  In Johnston,\r\n  the court noted that case presented an exceptional circumstance wherein the\r\n  State conceded that the trial court committed error by imposing an excessive\r\n  sentence.Â  The State nevertheless maintained that appellant's appropriate\r\n  remedy was through the Post Conviction Relief Act.Â  The Johnston court recognized\r\n  that if it unyieldingly enforced PCR as the only avenue of relief, there was a\r\n  real threat that appellant would remain incarcerated beyond the legal sentence\r\n  due to the additional time it would take to pursue such a remedy.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the court determined that exceptional circumstances warranted a remand for\r\n  resentencing.Â  Id. at 463-64, 510 S.E.2d at 425.Â Â  Â Â \r\nWhile the case at hand does not present a threat that Vick\r\n  will remain incarcerated beyond the legal sentence as in Johnston, our\r\n  courts have, in the past, &quot;summarily vacated&quot; sentences for\r\n  kidnapping where such sentences were precluded by Â§ 16-3-910 because the\r\n  defendant received a concurrent sentence under the murder statute.Â  SeeÂ  Owens, 331 S.C. at 585, 503 S.E.2d at 463; McCall, 304 S.C. at\r\n  470, 405 S.E.2d at 417 (noting the appellate courts have &quot;summarily\r\n  vacated&quot; sentences for kidnapping when the defendant received a concurrent\r\n  sentence under the murder statute).Â  Additionally, our courts have at times\r\n  considered an issue in the interest of judicial economy.Â  See S. Bell\r\n    Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Hamm, 306 S.C. 70, 75, 409 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1991) (holding,\r\n  where a party argued that the trial court erred in rendering judgment on a\r\n  constitutional issue inasmuch as such an analysis was &quot;purely advisory,&quot;\r\n  because the issue would be raised to the court at some future time and since\r\n  both parties had fully briefed the issue, it was proper for the appellate court\r\n  to decide the matter in the interest of judicial economy);Â  Jeter v. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 441 n.6, 633 S.E.2d 143, 147 n.6 (2006) (holding,\r\n  regardless of any preservation problems, the appellate court would address an\r\n  issue in the interest of judicial economy).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the testimony from Reeves was not hearsay and, even\r\n  if the testimony did constitute inadmissible hearsay, its admission was\r\n  harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Vick's guilt. Accordingly, we\r\n  affirm Vick's convictions.Â  However, because the State concedes the kidnapping\r\n  sentence was erroneously imposed, and in light of the fact our courts recognize\r\n  there may be exceptional circumstances allowing the appellate court to consider\r\n  an improper sentence even though no challenge was made to the sentence at trial\r\n  and have further summarily vacated in matters such as the one at hand, in the\r\n  interest of judicial economy we vacate the clearly erroneous kidnapping\r\n  sentence.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Pace stated that after watching the\r\n  news report, he knew it was July 31 when he had talked with Vick at the bowling\r\nalley. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4574","title":"State v.

Â Software incorporated into Patterson's computer\r\n  recorded the communications in real time. \r\nAt some point that night,\r\n  Skatergurl received a message from a person with the screen name &quot;Fine_Ass_Seminoles_Fan,&quot;\r\n  (FASF) asking her where she lived.Â  Skatergurl responded Oconee County.Â  FASF\r\n  then inquired of Skatergurl as to her name and age. Â Skatergurl responded with &quot;Karen&quot;\r\n  and &quot;fourteen.&quot;Â  FASF said his name was Jamey. Â Thereafter, the\r\n  following discussion occurred:\r\n\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Well, what you looking for? . . . Sex, Love, Relationships, Friends, What?\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    Laugh out loud.Â  What's everybody looking for?\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    I asked.Â  You tell me.\r\n  [Skatergurl]:Â \r\n    I don't know. Fun stuff.\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Sex? Love?\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    L.O.L., Laugh out loud.\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Honestly.\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    What are you looking for?\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Good Girl.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    You need some loving? I'm asking?\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    I don't know. Laugh out loud.\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    I do.\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    Kewl. \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  conversation turned to arranging a meeting place.Â  FASF asked when and where\r\n  they could meet.Â  Skatergurl replied they could only meet at night and\r\n  suggested Westminster Middle School.Â  Skatergurl subsequently asked:\r\n\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    Whatcha wanna do?\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Go back to my apt. â€“ I assume.Â  Okay?\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    Do what?\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    What you want to do.Â  Tell me.\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    I don't know.\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Watch movie, I dunno, talk.Â  Make love.\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    Make love?\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    Yes.Â  Wanna [] don't mean you have to.\r\n  [Skatergurl]:\r\n    You don't care I am 14?\r\n  [FASF]:\r\n    No.Â  You? \r\n\r\nFASF suggested\r\n  meeting between 2:00 and 2:15 a.m. at the middle school that night.Â  He told Skatergurl\r\n  he would arrive in a black truck or a red car and he confirmed what Skatergurl\r\n  would be wearing.Â  Just before signing out of the chat room, FASF said,\r\n  &quot;we come here and make love, okay, snuggle, kiss, whatever, okay?&quot; Â He\r\n  then asked, &quot;you wanna have sex, honestly,&quot; and Skatergurl responded,\r\n  &quot;I can try.&quot;\r\nOfficer Patterson\r\n  called another Westminster police officer and they stationed their vehicles near\r\n  the middle school.Â  At approximately 2:30 a.m., a red Toyota Celica pulled into\r\n  the parking lot.Â  The officers stopped the car and arrested the driver, Jamey Allen\r\n  Reid.Â Â  \r\nOn February 7,\r\n  2006, an Oconee County grand jury indicted Reid for attempted CSC with a minor\r\n  second degree and for criminal solicitation of a minor.Â  A jury trial was held\r\n  on March 7, 2007. Â At the close of the State's case, Reid's counsel moved for a\r\n  directed verdict of acquittal.Â  The court denied the motion.Â  The jury\r\n  convicted Reid on both charges.Â  The trial court sentenced Reid to twenty years\r\n  for the attempted CSC with a minor second degree conviction, which was suspended\r\n  upon the service of ten years with five years probation. Â Reid was sentenced to\r\n  ten years for the criminal solicitation of a minor, which was to run\r\n  concurrently.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in refusing to direct\r\n  a verdict of acquittal when the State failed to produce sufficient evidence for\r\n  the charge of attempted CSC with a minor second degree?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the trial court err in refusing to find\r\n  criminal solicitation of a minor was a lesser included offense of attempted CSC\r\n  with a minor second degree?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases,\r\n  appellate courts review errors of law only and are bound by the trial court's\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus, 367\r\n  S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nReid first argues\r\n  the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal because the\r\n  State failed to demonstrate Reid committed an overt act as required to prove\r\n  guilt for attempted CSC with a minor second degree.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, a trial court is concerned with the\r\n  existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Wetson,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  &quot;A defendant is entitled\r\n  to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.&quot;Â  State v. McCombs, 368 S.C. 489, 493, 629 S.E.2d 361,\r\n  362-63 (2006).Â Â  &quot;On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an\r\n  appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\n  State.&quot;Â Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36\r\n  (2001).Â  &quot;If there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  an appellate court must find\r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  State v. Cherry, 361\r\n  S.C. 588, 593-94, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).\r\nA\r\n  person is guilty of CSC with a minor in the second degree if the actor engages\r\n  in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years or less but who is at\r\n  least eleven years of age.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(B) (Supp. 2005).[1]Â \r\n  &quot;A person who commits the common law offense of attempt is punishable as\r\n  for the principal offense.&quot;Â  State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 396 n.3, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 n.3 (2000); see also, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-80 (2003).Â  Thus, the elements of\r\n  attempted CSC with a minor in the second degree are: (1) an attempt; (2) to\r\n  engage in a sexual battery; (3) with a victim; (4) who is fourteen years of age\r\n  or less; (5) but who is at least eleven years of age.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(B) (Supp. 2005) (statutory elements of the object crime).Â  \r\nGenerally, the mens\r\n  rea of an attempt crime is one of specific intent such that the act\r\n  constituting the attempt must be done with the intent to commit that particular\r\n  crime. Â Sutton, 340 S.C. at 397, 532 S.E.2d at 285.Â  &quot;In the\r\n  context of an attempt crime, specific intent means that the defendant\r\n  consciously intended the completion of acts comprising the choate offense.&quot;Â  State v. Nesbitt, 346 S.C. 226, 231, 550 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  (internal quotes omitted).Â  The State must prove the defendant's specific\r\n  intent was accompanied by some overt act, beyond mere preparation, in\r\n  furtherance of the intent.Â  Id.; see also, State v. Sosbee,\r\n  371 S.C. 104, 109, 637 S.E.2d 571, 573 (Ct. App. 2006) (defining attempt, in a\r\n  case categorizing criminal sexual conduct with a minor as a &quot;most serious\r\n  offense,&quot; as &quot;an overt act that is done with the intent to commit a\r\n  crime but that falls short of completing the crime.&quot;) (quoting Black's\r\n    Law Dictionary 123 (7th ed. 1999)).\r\nCourts have struggled\r\n  to determine the point at which conduct moves beyond the preparatory stage to\r\n  the perpetration stage. A competition amongst policy considerations exists in\r\n  this realm of the law.Â  On the one hand, there exists a policy not to punish or\r\n  convict innocent persons for evil or criminal thoughts alone;[2] on the other hand, a countervailing policy exists to allow law enforcement to\r\n  prevent criminal conduct before it reaches the point of completion.Â  South\r\n  Carolina jurisprudence in the area of attempt law is sparse.Â  Cases in South\r\n  Carolina do not clearly establish any absolute guiding test for our trial\r\n  courts to employ in resolution of this issue although Nesbitt utilizes\r\n  the overt act discussion in State v. Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 19 S.E.2d 101\r\n  (1942), a case not dealing specifically with attempt.Â  \r\nOther\r\n  state and federal courts have employed a variety of tests, some of which have\r\n  been used in part or interchangeably by various courts demonstrating the\r\n  difficulty in defining a universal test.Â  These tests generally are either\r\n  directed to how much has been done, or instead, how much remains to be done in\r\n  furtherance of the object crime.Â  Notwithstanding, one rule which does appear\r\n  consistent throughout the country is the sequence of events need not reach the\r\n  last proximate act necessary to completion, an original common law test.Â  Wayne\r\n  R. Lafave, 2 Subst. Crim. L. Â§ 11.4 (2d ed. 2008).\r\nCase\r\n  law additionally suggests varying proximity tests.Â  One test credited to\r\n  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the common law &quot;dangerous proximity&quot;\r\n  test, focuses on whether the act comes so close or near to the object crime\r\n  that the danger of success is very great. Â Id.; see Joshua\r\n  Dressler, Understanding Criminal Law 339 (5th ed. 2009). Â Essentially,\r\n  this test focuses upon how much remains to be done before the defendant would\r\n  have succeeded in his goals; often, factors such as the nearness of danger, the\r\n  substantiality of harm and the apprehension felt are considered. Â Dressler at\r\n  339 (referencing Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 48 N.E. 770 (Mass. 1897). Â Further,\r\n  the more severe the object crime, the less close the actor must come to\r\n  completing it in order to be convicted of attempt.Â  See Joshua Dressler, Cases and Materials on Criminal Law 762-63 (4th ed. 2007); see also People v. Burger, 280 P.2d 136, 138 (Cal. Ct. App. 1955) (the more\r\n  clearly the intent to commit the offense is proven, the less proximate the acts\r\n  need to be to completion); Van Bell v. State, 775 P.2d 1273, 1275 (Nev.\r\n  1989) (&quot;[I]n our review of an 'attempt' offense, we emphasize the inverse\r\n  relationship which exists between the defendant's intent to commit the crime\r\n  and the performance of an overt act toward the commission of the crime.&quot;).\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  the &quot;physical proximity&quot; test focuses upon whether the defendant's\r\n  acts &quot;may be said to be physically proximate to the intended crime.&quot; Â Â Lafave,\r\n  2 Subst. Crim. L. Â§ 11.4.Â  This test has been further described as focusing\r\n  upon an act which amounts to the commencement of the consummation of the object\r\n  crime or stands &quot;either as the first or some subsequent step in direct\r\n  movement towards the commission of the offense after preparations are made.&quot;Â  State v. Dowd, 28 N.C. App. 32, 37, 220 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1975); see United States v. Mandujano, 499 F.2d 370, 374 (5th Cir. 1974); Dressler, Understanding Criminal Law at 398.\r\nAnother\r\n  test, the &quot;substantial step&quot; test, derives from the Model Penal Code\r\n  and focuses upon whether the defendant has taken a substantial step that\r\n  strongly corroborates his intent to commit the object crime.Â  Model Penal Code\r\n  Â§5.01.Â  Here, the court looks to what has been done as opposed to what remains\r\n  to be done.Â  Thus, the drafters of the model code noted that the scope of\r\n  attempt liability would be broadened consistent with the policy of restraining\r\n  dangerous persons where the firmness of criminal purpose is shown. Lafave, 2\r\n  Subst. Crim. L. Â§ 11.4.[3]\r\nThe Mandujano court, relying upon the Model Penal Code references to other formulations of\r\n  various tests, indicated the following additional tests:\r\n\r\n  (c) The\r\n    indispensable element test- a variation of the proximity tests which emphasizes\r\n    any indispensable aspect of the criminal endeavor over which the actor has not\r\n    yet acquired control.\r\n    (d) The\r\n    probable desistance test- the conduct constitutes an attempt if, in the\r\n    ordinary and natural course of events, without interruption from an outside\r\n    source, it will result in the crime intended.\r\n    (e) The\r\n    abnormal step approach- an attempt is a step toward crime which goes beyond the\r\n    point where the normal citizen would think better of his conduct and desist.\r\n    (f) The\r\n    res ipsa loquitur or unequivocality test- an attempt is committed when the\r\n    actor's conduct manifests an intent to commit a crime.\r\n  \r\n499 F.2d at 373 n.5.Â  Some of\r\n  these tests bear different labels but are essentially consistent with the above-mentioned\r\n  discussion.Â  One final test, at least in name, an overt act test, simply\r\n  suggests any overt or positive act in furtherance of the attempted crime may be\r\n  sufficient. Â See Sosbee, 371 S.C. at 109, 637 S.E.2d at 573\r\n  (dicta); see also State v. Rallo, 304 S.C. 258, 269, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  653, 659 (1991) (Toal, J., dissenting) (&quot;In order to constitute an attempt\r\n  to commit a crime, it is essential that, coupled with the intent to commit the\r\n  offense, there be some overt act, beyond mere preparation, in furtherance of\r\n  the intent, and there must be an actual or present ability to complete the\r\n  crime.&quot;); David Crump et al., Criminal Law: Cases, Statutes, and\r\n    Lawyering Strategies 537 (2005) (classifying the overt act approach as an actus\r\n  reus test wherein &quot;any positive act in furtherance of the attempt is\r\n  sufficient (a minimal requirement).&quot;).\r\nAs indicated, we have not found any case in South Carolina\r\n  specifically indicating how far a person must go before that person may be\r\n  convicted of attempt to commit a crime.Â  However, our state supreme court has\r\n  provided some guidance, albeit dicta, in Quick, a case not involving the\r\n  crime of attempt, but subsequently utilized by the court of appeals in Nesbitt.\r\n  Â Nesbitt, 346 S.C. at 231, 550 S.E.2d at 866-67 (quoting Quick, 199\r\n  S.C. at 259-60, 19 S.E.2d at 102-03).Â  Although the crime of attempt was not at\r\n  issue in Quick, the court nonetheless discussed the distinction between\r\n  preparations and overt acts, making reference in part to an &quot;attempt to\r\n  commit.&quot;Â  Quick, 199 S.C. at 260, 19 S.E.2d at 103. The court\r\n  indicated &quot;preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or\r\n  measures necessary for the commission of the crime; the attempt or overt act is\r\n  the direct movement toward the commission, after the preparations are made.&quot;Â  Id. at 260, 19 S.E.2d at 103.Â  The court went on to articulate &quot;'the\r\n  act' is to be liberally construed, and in numerous cases it is said to be\r\n  sufficient that the act go far enough toward accomplishment of the crime to\r\n  amount to the commencement of its consummation.&quot;Â  Id. at 259, 19\r\n  S.E.2d at 102.Â  Further, the court explained, &quot;the act need not be the\r\n  last proximate step leading to the consummation of the offense.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nOur sister state,\r\n  North Carolina, has employed a similar test as that suggested in Quick.Â  Dowd, 220 S.E.2d at 396.Â  In describing the law of attempt, North Carolina\r\n  courts have indicated &quot;it is essential that the defendant, with the intent\r\n  of committing the particular crime, should have done some overt act adapted to,\r\n  approximating, and which in the ordinary and likely course of things would\r\n  result in the commission thereof.&quot; Â Id. Thus, &quot;the act must\r\n  reach far enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to\r\n  the commencement of the consummation.&quot;Â Â Â  Id. The court further\r\n  elaborated &quot;while it need not be the last proximate act to the consummation\r\n  of the offense attempted to be perpetrated, it must approach sufficiently near\r\n  to it to stand either as the first or some subsequent step in a direct movement\r\n  towards the commission of the offense after the preparations are made.&quot; Â Id.\r\nReviewing the facts\r\n  herein, Reid asked a person whom he thought was a fourteen year old girl if she\r\n  would meet him within the hour in order to &quot;make love . . . snuggle, kiss,\r\n  whatever.&quot;Â  Moreover, the last question Reid asked Skatergurl was,\r\n  &quot;you wanna have sex, honestly?&quot; Â This evidence constituted\r\n  evidence of Reid's specific intent to accomplish CSC with a minor.Â  Having\r\n  found evidence of the specific intent to commit the underlying offense, we must\r\n  determine whether the State offered sufficient evidence demonstrating Reid\r\n  committed some act toward the commission of the crime beyond any act or acts of\r\n  preparation.\r\nAs\r\n  noted in Quick, no definite rule as to what constitutes an overt act for\r\n  attempt purposes can safely be laid down and each case is dependent upon its\r\n  particular facts and the inferences which the jury may reasonably draw\r\n  therefrom, &quot;subject to general principles applied as nearly as can be,\r\n  with a view to working substantial justice.&quot; Â Quick, 199 S.C. at 259,\r\n  19 S.E.2d at 102. Â Â Moreover, as indicated in Mandujano, &quot;it seems\r\n  equally clear that the semantical distinction between preparation and attempt\r\n  is one incapable of being formulated in a hard and fast rule.&quot; Â 499 F.2d\r\n  at 373.Â  As an example, the court noted that &quot;[t]he procuring of the\r\n  instrument of the crime might be preparation in one factual situation and not\r\n  in another.&quot; Id.; see Â United States v. Neal, 78 F.3d\r\n  901, 906 (4th Cir. 1996) (suggesting the line between mere preparation and\r\n  attempt is fact intensive and must be determined on a case by case basis).Â \r\n  Thus, once we have determined whether there exists some act separate from an\r\n  act of preparation, we must also determine whether that act is sufficient to\r\n  justify an attempt conviction.[4]\r\nWe\r\n  have not found any precedent within our State addressing this specific type of\r\n  factual situation.Â  However, a significant number of other jurisdictions confronted\r\n  with this issue have concluded that the act of a defendant who travels to a\r\n  prearranged location with the purpose of having sex with an individual whom he\r\n  believes is a child is a sufficient act in furtherance of an attempted sex\r\n  crime. Â See, e.g., United States v. Farner, 251 F.3d 510, 513\r\n  (5th Cir. 2001) (substantial step test); State v. Glass, 87 P.3d 302,\r\n  307 (Idaho Ct. App. 2003) (applying the &quot;dangerous proximity&quot; test,\r\n  while using &quot;substantial step&quot; cases in analysis); People v.\r\n    Patterson, 734 N.E.2d 462,\r\n  470 (Ill. Ct. App. 2000) (using term &quot;overt act&quot; to determine whether\r\n  a &quot;substantial step&quot; had been made for attempt); Cook v. State,\r\n  256 S.W.3d 846, 849 (Tex. Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;[A]ll the State was required to\r\n  allege and prove . . . was that [defendant] had the intent to commit aggravated\r\n  sexual assault of a child, and did an act amounting to more than mere\r\n  preparation, that tended but failed to effect the actual commission of the offense\r\n  intended.&quot;); State v. Townsend, 57 P.3d 255, 262 (Wash. 2002) (en\r\n  banc) (&quot;[I]t makes no difference that [defendant] could not have completed\r\n  the crime because 'Amber' did not exist.Â  He is guilty if he intended to\r\n  have sexual intercourse with her.&quot;) (emphasis in original).[5]\r\nHowever,\r\n  other jurisdictions have held merely arriving at an arranged location is\r\n  insufficient to constitute a sufficient act in furtherance of a planned sex\r\n  crime.Â  See, e.g., State v. Duke, 709 So.2d 580, 582 (Fla. Ct.\r\n  App. 1998) (holding the State failed to establish an overt act leading to the\r\n  commission of a sexual battery where the defendant discussed sexual acts with a\r\n  person the defendant believed to have been a minor, planned an occasion when he\r\n  could carry out those acts, and arrived at the prearranged meeting point); State\r\n    v. Kemp, 753 N.E.2d 47, 50-51 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (finding circumstances\r\n  of defendant's conduct alleged in the State's information did not reach the\r\n  level of an overt act showing defendant committed a substantial step toward the\r\n  offense beyond mere preparation), superseded in part by statute, Ind.\r\n  Code Â§ 35-42-4-6 (West 2004), as recognized in Alpin v. State,\r\n  889 N.E.2d 882, 885 n.5 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008); People v. Walter, 810\r\n  N.E.2d 626 (Ill. Ct. App. 2004) (finding circumstances of defendant's conduct\r\n  fell short of demonstrating either actual intent to have sex or a substantial\r\n  step beyond mere preparation).\r\nHere, based on the\r\n  evidence presented, Reid completed a requisite act in furtherance of the offense\r\n  of attempted CSC with a minor second degree.Â  Reid, in preparation, arranged a\r\n  time and meeting location with a person whom he thought to be a minor.Â  Reid\r\n  described the type of car he would be driving and he confirmed the description\r\n  of Skatergurl's clothing.Â  Further, Reid left the location where he was\r\n  communicating with Skatergurl and committed an act beyond mere preparation in driving\r\n  to and physically arriving at the prearranged location within fifteen minutes\r\n  of the agreed upon time.[6] Â See Quick, 199 S.C. at 259, 19 S.E.2d at 102 (noting courts\r\n  should liberally construe whether an act rose to the level of an overt act in\r\n  furtherance of crime). Â Reid's act, for purposes of directed verdict,\r\n  constituted evidence of the first or some subsequent step in a direct movement\r\n  towards the commission of the offense after any act or acts of preparation.[7] Â \r\nMoreover,\r\n  we give weight to the policy goal of stopping dangerous persons through earlier\r\n  intervention by law enforcement by punishing the attempted conduct as a crime,\r\n  especially in any cybermolester type cases where the conduct also clearly\r\n  manifests or strongly corroborates the intent to commit such a dangerous object\r\n  crime. Â Accordingly, the trial court did not err because the evidence was\r\n  sufficient to withstand Reid's motion for a directed verdict and warranted\r\n  submission of the case to the jury.Â  See Cherry, 361 S.C. at\r\n  593-94, 606 S.E.2d at 478 (providing an appellate court must find a case was\r\n  properly submitted to a jury, if there is any direct evidence or any\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused).\r\nReid also contends\r\n  the trial court erred in ruling criminal solicitation of a minor was not a lesser\r\n  included offense of attempted CSC with a minor second degree. Â We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  test for determining whether a crime is a lesser included offense of the crime\r\n  charged is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the elements of\r\n  the lesser offense.&quot;Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 215, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 873, 877 (2007).Â  Absent some special exception, if the lesser offense\r\n  includes an element not included in the greater offense, then the lesser\r\n  offense is not included in the greater.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  previously indicated, the elements of attempted CSC with a minor in the second\r\n  degree are: (1) an\r\n  attempt; (2) to engage in a sexual battery; (3) with a victim; (4) who is\r\n  fourteen years of age or less; (5) but who is at least eleven years of age.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(B) (Supp. 2005) (statutory elements of the object\r\n  crime).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  elements of criminal solicitation of a minor include: Â (1) the defendant is\r\n  eighteen years of age or older; (2) he or she knowingly contacts or\r\n  communicates with, or attempts to contact or communicate with; (3) a person who\r\n  is under the age of eighteen, or a person reasonably believed to be under the\r\n  age of eighteen; (4) for the purpose of or with the intent of persuading,\r\n  inducing, enticing, or coercing the person to engage or participate in a sexual\r\n  activity as defined in Section 16-15-375(5) or a violent crime as defined in\r\n  Section 16-1-60; or (5) with the intent to perform a sexual activity in the\r\n  presence of the person under the age of eighteen, or person reasonably believed\r\n  to be under the age of eighteen.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-342(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nHere, the trial\r\n  court did not err in charging separate crimes because the greater offense, attempted\r\n  CSC with a minor second degree, did not include an element of the lesser\r\n  offense, which was contacting or attempting to contact an underage person or a\r\n  person thought to be underage. Â Given the greater of the two offenses did not\r\n  include all the elements of the lesser offense, the trial court did not err in\r\n  refusing to charge criminal solicitation of a minor as a lesser included\r\n  offense.[8]Â  See State v. Fristoe, 658 P.2d 825, 831 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1983)\r\n  (Stating solicitation is not a lesser included offense of attempt.\r\n  &quot;[T]here are many instances in which oral sexual contact with a minor\r\n  could be attempted without involving any request or solicitation for the minor\r\n  to engage in the contact.&quot;); see also State v. Bland, 318\r\n  S.C. 315, 317-18, 457 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1995) (holding where the greater offense\r\n  did not contain all the elements of the lesser, the court of appeals properly found\r\n  two separate crimes); State v. Kirby, 325 S.C. 390, 399, 481 S.E.2d 150,\r\n  154 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing the convictions are \r\nAFFIRMED.[9]\r\nHUFF\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The statute, as amended, became effective June 1,\r\n2005.Â  Reid was arrested in January 2006.Â  \r\n[2] See State v. Evans, 216 S.C. 328, 333,\r\n  57 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1950) (&quot;The law does not concern itself with mere\r\n  guilty intention, unconnected with any overt act.&quot;) (citing State v.\r\n    Kelly 114 S.C. 336, 338, 103 S.E. 511, 512 (1920)).Â  This statement simply\r\n  reflects that generally a crime includes both an actus reus component and a\r\nmens rea component.Â  \r\n[3] The United States Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\r\n  utilizes the substantial step test.Â  United States v. Pratt, 351 F.3d\r\n  131, 135-36 (4th Cir. 2003).Â  According to Professor Dressler's research, at\r\n  least 25 states have codified the &quot;substantial step&quot; standard.Â \r\nDressler, Understanding Criminal Law at 413 n.190).\r\n[4] We note, however, there is some authority for the\r\n  proposition that some acts of preparation may be sufficient for attempt\r\n  purposes.Â  As Justice Holmes stated, &quot;preparation is not an attempt.Â  But\r\n  some preparations may amount to an attempt.Â  It is a question of degree.&quot;Â  Commonwealth v. Peaslee, 59 N.E. 55, 56 (Mass. 1901).Â  We need not\r\n  resolve this issue because we agree with Mandujano that this question is\r\n  merely semantic in nature.Â  499 F.2d at 373.Â  Notwithstanding, we further note\r\nsome states have abandoned the &quot;mere preparation&quot; distinction.Â  See State v. Reeves, 916 S.W.2d 909 (Tenn. 1996).\r\n[5] Additional cases and jurisdictions addressing the\r\n  matter include the following: United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222, 1227\r\n  (11th Cir. 2002) (substantial step test); State v. Sorabella, 891 A.2d\r\n  897, 915 (Conn. 2006) (substantial step test); Dennard v. State, 534\r\n  S.E.2d 182, 188 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000) (substantial step test); State v.\r\n    Risinger, 194 P.3d 52, 54 (Kan. Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;To be convicted of an\r\n  attempt crime, a defendant must intentionally take a first step towards\r\n  committing that crime.Â  Our courts call that step 'performing an overt\r\n  act.'&quot;); Commonwealth v. Bell, 853 N.E.2d 563, 569-70 (Mass. Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (using overt act language while applying proximity analysis); State\r\n    v. Tarbay, 810 N.E.2d 979, 984 (Ohio Ct. App. 2004) (substantial step test); see also United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 640 (6th Cir.\r\n  2000) (&quot;The prosecution must have presented evidence of objective, overt\r\n  acts that would allow a reasonable jury to find [the defendant] had taken a\r\nsubstantial step. . . .&quot;).\r\n[6] Reid arguably would have been closer to committing\r\n  the attempted crime had a minor been present upon Reid's arrival.Â  However,\r\n  this court has previously stressed &quot;[i]t should not be necessary to\r\n  subject victims to a face-to-face confrontation with a lethal weapon in order\r\n  to find the essential element of an overt act.&quot;Â  Nesbitt, 346 S.C.\r\n  at 234, 550 S.E.2d at 868 (finding sufficient evidence of an overt act warranting\r\n  the trial court to charge the jury with attempted robbery).Â  Further, while\r\n  there is no evidence a lethal weapon was present, this type of situation is\r\n  just as dangerous or potentially injurious to a minor.Â  Therefore, consistent\r\n  with our state's public policy to protect minors from harm, a minor need not be\r\n  present in order to prove an act in furtherance of the commission of an\r\n  attempted sex crime.Â  Early intervention is appropriate in light of the serious\r\nnature of this crime.\r\n[7] We recognize the significant number of jurisdictions\r\n  adopting the substantial step test.Â  Many of these states have done so by\r\n  legislative enactment and this may be a matter worthy of legislative\r\n  attention.Â  Notwithstanding, even if the South Carolina Supreme Court were to\r\n  adopt a substantial step test, we find the case herein would meet that test as\r\ndemonstrated by the case law cited herein.\r\n[8] Reid also alleges because an attempt crime requires\r\n  the State to prove an overt act in furtherance of the principal crime, the\r\n  additional element of the lesser offense, in this instance communicating with\r\n  the victim, was an element of attempted CSC with a minor second degree.Â  This\r\n  argument has no merit.Â  One may attempt to commit CSC with a minor without any\r\n  communication at all.Â  See Fristoe, 658 P.2d at 831. Â Regardless\r\n  of whether the act of communication is an act of preparation or an act in\r\n  furtherance of the crime, it is not dispositive of a lesser included offense\r\n  analysis. Thus, the trial court properly charged the jury with the two separate\r\noffenses.Â  \r\n[9] No issues were raised herein as to merger,\r\n  impossibility, or entrapment and we need not address those doctrines or their\r\napplicability.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
