Dudek, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  William Townes Jones, Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Randy Wakefield Anderson was \r\n  convicted of murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.Â  \r\n  He appeals, arguing the trial court erred (1) in allowing the admission of hearsay \r\n  evidence and (2) in admitting statements into evidence which were taken in violation \r\n  of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nAround midnight on May 10, 1998, Jamal Manick shot \r\n  and killed Lamont Rappley in the parking lot of a restaurant.Â  At trial, the \r\n  State alleged that Appellant conspired with Manick and Fred Ross to rob the \r\n  victim. Officer Shawn Fisher testified that upon arriving at the scene, he observed \r\n  the victim lying face down on the pavement with Appellant kneeling beside him. \r\n  Appellant told Officer Fisher: â€œMy manâ€™s been shot.â€ During this time, Kenneth \r\n  Williams, a friend of the victim, arrived at the scene. Officer Fisher instructed \r\n  Appellant to sit in his patrol car while he secured the scene. \r\nAfter securing the scene, Officer Fisher \r\n  returned to his patrol car to speak with Appellant.Â  Anderson explained that \r\n  he was walking with Williams through the restaurantâ€™s parking lot when a car \r\n  approached, and a passenger got out, shot the victim, jumped back in the car, \r\n  and left the scene. According to Appellant, he and Williams then left the scene \r\n  to call 911. \r\nWilliams, a witness for the State, testified that \r\n  on the evening of May 10, 1998, the victim asked Williams to accompany him to \r\n  the restaurant to conduct a drug deal. When they arrived at the restaurant, \r\n  Williams â€œhung backâ€ as the victim met with Anderson to conduct the deal. Williams \r\n  stated that about five or ten minutes later, it began raining and he and the \r\n  victim began to leave the parking lot. As they were walking away, Williams saw \r\n  headlights and turned around; he then saw a man jump from the car, and shoot \r\n  the victim. After the shooting, he and Anderson ran to the victimâ€™s house, which \r\n  was nearby, to call 911. Williams admitted that he initially lied to the police \r\n  when questioned about the circumstances surrounding the shooting because he \r\n  â€œdidnâ€™t want it to look like a drug-crime.â€ \r\nFred Ross also testified for the State.Â  According \r\n  to Ross, he was hanging out in an apartment with Manick on the day of the incident. \r\n  Ross claimed that Appellant arrived at the apartment and told themÂ  â€œthat he \r\n  had a lick,â€ indicating that the men could rob the victim. Ross testified that \r\n  later in the evening, he drove Manick to the restaurant where Appellant had \r\n  set up a drug deal with the victim. Ross stated that as they approached the \r\n  restaurant, Manick jumped out of the car and shot the victim. On cross-examination, \r\n  Ross acknowledged that he had a deal with the State allowing him to plead guilty \r\n  to accessory after the fact of murder and accessory after the fact of armed \r\n  robbery, charges which carry maximum ten-year prison sentences, in exchange \r\n  for his testimony. \r\nBobby Lukie, who rode with Ross and Manick to the restaurant, \r\n  also testified that Manick shot the victim. Lukie maintained that he was not \r\n  involved in planning the robbery and that he merely ran into Ross and Manick \r\n  at a convenience store that night and decided to accompany them to the restaurant.Â  \r\n  The defenseâ€™s theory of the case, however, was that it was Lukie, not Appellant, \r\n  who planned the robbery of the victim.\r\nThe jury found Appellant guilty of all charges and \r\n  sentenced him to thirty years for murder, twenty years concurrent for armed \r\n  robbery, and five years concurrent for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. This \r\n  appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hearsay\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred \r\n  in allowing Lukie to testify regarding statements allegedly made to him by Ross.Â  \r\n  Appellant asserts that this testimony constituted impermissible hearsay.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nAt trial, Lukie testified that around 11:00 p.m. \r\n  on the night of the murder, he drove by a convenience store and noticed Ross \r\n  and Manick standing outside the store. Lukie stated that when he asked Ross \r\n  and Manick what they were doing, Ross told him â€œthey had a lick or something \r\n  like that.â€ Defense counsel objected, arguing this testimony was hearsay. The \r\n  State argued the testimony was admissible as non-hearsay because the statement \r\n  was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.Â Â  The trial court agreed and overruled \r\n  the defenseâ€™s objection.\r\nRule 801(d)(2)(E), SCRE, provides thatÂ  \r\n  â€œa statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance \r\n  of the conspiracyâ€ is not hearsay.Â  See also State v. Gilchrist, \r\n  342 S.C. 369, 371, 536 S.E.2d 868, 869 (2000) (noting that Rule 801(d)(2)(E) \r\n  allows for the admission of a coconspiratorâ€™s statement where there is evidence \r\n  of the conspiracy independent of the statement sought to be admitted). Here, \r\n  there was evidence presented at trial that Ross and Manick conspired with Appellant \r\n  to rob and murder the victim.Â  The statements allegedly made to Lukie by Ross \r\n  were sufficient to allow the jury to reasonably infer that the statements were \r\n  made in furtherance of the conspiracy, especially in light of the fact that \r\n  Lukie agreed to accompany Ross and Manick in their robbery of the victim.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the statement was not hearsay.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Sixth Amendment\r\nAppellant also argues the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to suppress a statement he made to police on June 16, 1998 because \r\n  it was taken in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  We agree.\r\n At trial, a Jackson v. Denno [1]  hearing was held to determine the admissibility \r\n  of statements Appellant made to police.Â  Officer Fisher testified that, immediately \r\n  following the shooting, Appellant agreed to accompany him to the police station, \r\n  and a gunshot residue test was performed on Appellant. Officer Raczinsky went \r\n  to Appellantâ€™s home on June 15, 1998 to discuss the positive results of the \r\n  gunshot residue test. After this discussion, Appellant accompanied Raczinsky \r\n  to the police station, and following a brief interview, he was arrested for \r\n  murdering the victim. Raczinsky read Miranda warnings to Anderson and \r\n  escorted him to jail.Â  \r\nAt 11:30 the next morning, Appellant was \r\n  arraigned for the murder, and he signed a form requesting the services of a \r\n  public defender. Later that afternoon, Andersonâ€™s aunt visited with him at the \r\n  police station.Â  Raczinsky testified that after the visit, the aunt â€œsuggested \r\n  I go talk to [Anderson] again.â€Â  Raczinsky testified that he then went in to \r\n  talk with Anderson, read to him his Miranda warnings, and asked if â€œanything \r\n  had changed since the last time [they] talked.â€ Appellant then told Raczinsky \r\n  that â€œhe was at [the restaurant] in reference to a drug transaction.â€ Appellant \r\n  explained that he met the victim earlier in the day and had arranged to purchase \r\n  crack cocaine from him around midnight.Â  Defense counsel objected to the admission \r\n  of this statement, arguing it was initiated by the police and was made after \r\n  Appellant had invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  \r\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees that in all criminal \r\n  prosecutions â€œthe accused shall enjoy the right to . . . have the Assistance \r\n  of Counsel for his defence.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  â€œ[O]nce a criminal defendant \r\n  invokes his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a subsequent waiver of that rightâ€”even \r\n  if voluntary, knowing, and intelligent under traditional standardsâ€”is presumed \r\n  invalid if secured pursuant to police-initiated conversation,â€ and â€œstatements \r\n  obtained in violation of that rule may not be admitted as substantive evidence \r\n  in the prosecutionâ€™s case in chief.â€Â  Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U.S. 344, \r\n  345 (1990) (stating the holding of Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, \r\n  106 S. Ct. 1404 (1986)). Likewise, the South Carolina Supreme Court has held:\r\n\r\nWhen the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has attached, if \r\n  police initiate interrogation after a defendantâ€™s assertion, at an arraignment \r\n  or other similar proceedings, of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendantâ€™s \r\n  right to counsel for that police initiated interrogation is invalid unless the \r\n  defendant initiates the contact himself.\r\n\r\nState v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 15-16, 515 \r\n  S.E.2d 508, 515 (1999).Â  \r\nHere, in ruling that Appellantâ€™s statement was \r\n  admissible, the trial court first found that Officer Raczinsky â€œwas not restrained \r\n  in his questioning of [Appellant] by the existence of the document [requesting \r\n  the services of a public defender] . . . because it was signed at a time different \r\n  from and a place different from [where Appellant was questioned].â€Â  However, \r\n  this very issue was considered by the United States Supreme Court in Michigan \r\n  v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, 634 (1986) and was resolved in favor of the defendant \r\n  because â€œSixth Amendment principles require that we impute the Stateâ€™s knowledge \r\n  from one state actor to another.â€Â  Thus, the police (one state actor) may not \r\n  claim to be ignorant of Appellantâ€™s request for counsel at his arraignment before \r\n  the court (another state actor).Â  Id.\r\nAs additional support for admitting Appellantâ€™s \r\n  statement into evidence, the trial court found that Appellantâ€™s signing of the \r\n  paperwork for a public defender was not enough to invoke his right to counsel.Â  \r\n  However, pursuant to State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 15-16, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  508, 515 (1999), we believe signing the paperwork requesting a public defender \r\n  did invoke Appellantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\r\nIn Council, the defendant was arraigned \r\n  on October 14, 1992, and requested the court appoint an attorney to represent \r\n  him. Id. at 14, 515 S.E.2d at 514. An attorney was appointed to represent \r\n  the defendant on October 16, 1992, and the defendant made inculpatory statements \r\n  to the police on October 19, 1992.Â  Id. In discussing the defendantâ€™s \r\n  claim that the October 19th statements were obtained in violation \r\n  of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the court found as follows: â€œAppellantâ€™s \r\n  Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached on October 14, 1992, when he was arraigned.Â  \r\n  Further, appellant asserted his right to counsel on October 14, 1992, when he \r\n  requested appointment of counsel.â€ Id.Â  As in Council, we find \r\n  that Andersonâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached at the time of his \r\n  arraignment, and he invoked that right by requesting a public defender at 11:30 \r\n  a.m. on June 16, 1998.\r\nAccordingly, we find that Officer Raczinskyâ€™s \r\n  contact with Appellant violated the protections afforded Appellant under the \r\n  Sixth Amendment.Â Â  Even if the police re-entered the room at the behest of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  aunt, Officer Raczinsky admitted that he initiated the conversation with Appellant \r\n  by asking him if â€œanything had changedâ€ since the last time the two had spoken.Â  \r\n  Thus, the trial court erred in admitting Appellantâ€™s statement about the â€œdrug \r\n  dealâ€ because it was made after Appellant had invoked his Sixth Amendment right \r\n  to counsel and was pursuant to a conversation he did not initiate.Â  Therefore, \r\n  Appellantâ€™s convictions are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.Â  \r\n\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3731","title":"Electro-Lab of Aiken v.

HarteÂ  and David W. Miller, of Aiken and James D. Mosteller, III, \r\n  of Barnwell, for Appellant.\r\nThomas B. Jackson, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Electro-Lab of Aiken \r\n  asserts that Sharp Construction Company breached the partiesâ€™ contract by replacing \r\n  Electro-Lab with a different subcontractor.Â  The parties became contractually \r\n  bound, Electro-Lab argues, by virtue of Sharpâ€™s use of Electro-Labâ€™s subcontracting \r\n  bid in its general contracting bid and by certain acts following the use of \r\n  the bid.Â  The trial court disagreed, concluding that no contract existed between \r\n  the parties.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 24, 1997, bidding closed for \r\n  all general contractors on two projects to build schools in York County, South \r\n  Carolina.Â  Before the bid deadline, Sharp Construction Co., a general contractor, \r\n  received an oral bid by telephone from Electro-Lab pertaining to one of the \r\n  school projectsâ€™ electrical work.Â  Electro-Labâ€™s bid amount was $1,150,000.Â  \r\n  Sharp listed Electro-Lab in its overall general contractorâ€™s bid submitted to \r\n  the projectâ€™s owner.Â  Sharp alleges this inclusion was actually a mistake because \r\n  it had inadvertently overlooked a lower bid from another electrical subcontractor, \r\n  Ind-Com Electric Company, Inc. for $1,140,000.Â  However, this oversight was \r\n  not discovered until after Sharp submitted its general contractorâ€™s bid.Â  At \r\n  the time Sharp submitted its general contractorâ€™s bid, the only information \r\n  it had about Electro-Labâ€™s bid was the dollar amount.Â  \r\nSharp, as the low bidder for the project, \r\n  was awarded the general contract and was required to provide payment and performance \r\n  bonds.Â Â  When Electro-Lab contacted Sharp to inquire about the project, Sharp \r\n  notified Electro-Lab that its bid was the lowest and that it was listed as the \r\n  electrical subcontractor in Sharpâ€™s successful bid. Sharpâ€™s project manager \r\n  testified that during this telephone conversation, he told Electro-Lab that \r\n  he would like to know what its bond rate was and asked Electro-Lab to fax its \r\n  bid in writing.Â  Shortly thereafter, Sharp discovered that Electro-Labâ€™s subcontract \r\n  bid was not the lowest bid received, and asked Electro-Lab if it could perform \r\n  the work for $1,140,000.Â  Electro-Lab agreed, and Sharp submitted the following \r\n  confirmatory fax:\r\n\r\nDear Michael:\r\n  This letter is to confirm that we will be issuing a subcontract \r\n  for the electrical work on the above referenced project for $1,140,000.00.\r\n  Please proceed immediately with having shop drawing completed \r\n  and performance and payment bonds issued.Â  A subcontract is forthcoming.Â  We \r\n  look forward to working with you.\r\nSincerely,\r\nSHARP CONSTRUCTION CO.\r\nOF SUMTER, INC. \r\nHAL TURNER\r\n\r\nFollowing receipt of this letter, Electro-Lab \r\n  attended a pre-construction conference at Sharpâ€™s request and began gathering \r\n  submittals for the project from suppliers.Â  Approximately six weeks after bidding \r\n  closed on the project, Electro-Lab informed Sharp that it had been unable to \r\n  obtain the required bonds.Â  According to Sharp, during this telephone conversation \r\n  Electro-Lab requested that its name be withdrawn from further consideration \r\n  as the electrical subcontractor for the project.Â  Electro-Lab disputes this, \r\n  maintaining that it never requested to be withdrawn from consideration.\r\nAfter Electro-Lab informed Sharp that \r\n  it could not obtain the bonds, Sharp entered into a subcontract for the same \r\n  dollar amount with Ind-Com, which provided payment and performance bonds as \r\n  required.Â  By letter, Sharp confirmed that it would be switching to a different \r\n  electrical subcontractor because of Electro-Labâ€™s inability to obtain bonding.Â  \r\n\r\nElectro-Lab did not protest the change until \r\n  nine months later when it initiated the instant lawsuit, alleging that Sharp \r\n  breached their contract by switching the subcontract for the projectâ€™s electrical \r\n  work to Ind-Com.Â  After a full trial on the merits, the trial judge ruled in \r\n  favor of Sharp, determining that no contract existed between the parties and \r\n  that Electro-Labâ€™s proof of damages was legally insufficient.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for breach of contract is an \r\n  action at law.Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C. 578, 581, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 496, 497 (Ct. App. 1998) (citation omitted).Â  In an action at law, \r\n  on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s standard of \r\n  review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. \r\n  v.

Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d \r\n  432, 439 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  The necessary elements of a contract \r\n  are offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.Â  Carolina Amusement Co. \r\n  v. Connecticut Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 215, 220, 437 S.E.2d 122, 125 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In this case, there was a valid oral offer to perform electrical \r\n  subcontract work for $1,150,000 based on the telephone bid received by Sharp \r\n  before Sharp furnished its general contractorâ€™s bid to the project owner.Â  See \r\n  id. (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 24 (1981) (â€œâ€˜An offer \r\n  is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify \r\n  another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and \r\n  will conclude it.â€™â€). See also Klose v. Sequoia Union High Sch. Dist., \r\n  258 P.2d 515, 517 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1953) (â€œA subcontractor bidder merely \r\n  makes an offer that is converted into a contract by a regularly communicated \r\n  acceptance conveyed to him by the general contractor.â€).Â  As a result, the issue \r\n  in this case turns on whether Sharpâ€™s conduct following Electro-Labâ€™s bid amounted \r\n  to acceptance of Electro-Labâ€™s offer.Â Â Â  \r\nJurisdictions outside of South Carolina \r\n  have consistently held that a general contractorâ€™s use of a subcontractorâ€™s \r\n  bid is not an acceptance that creates a contractual relationship between the \r\n  general contractor and the subcontractor should the general contractor become \r\n  the successful bidder.Â  See, e.g., Elec.

Bona Fide Builders, Inc., 301 P.2d \r\n  759, 763 (Wash. 1956).\r\nIn accordance with these jurisdictions \r\n  and based on general contract law principles, we agree that a general contractorâ€™s \r\n  mere use of a subcontractorâ€™s bid in a general contractorâ€™s successful overall \r\n  bid does not constitute acceptance of an offer.Â  â€œAcceptance of an offer is \r\n  a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the offeree in a manner \r\n  invited or required by the offer.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 50 (1981).Â  \r\n  A typical contract contains mutual promises and is created by an acceptance \r\n  constituting a return promise by the offeree.Â  See Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Contracts Â§ 50 cmt. c (1981); Â Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. \r\n  397, 405, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003) (â€œA bilateral contract . . . exists when \r\n  both parties exchange mutual promises.â€).Â  Moreover, a contract only arises \r\n  when there is an actual agreement by the parties in which the parties demonstrate \r\n  a mutual intent to be bound.Â  Timmons v. McCutcheon, 284 S.C. 4, 9-10, \r\n  324 S.E.2d 319, 322 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Sharpâ€™s mere use of Electro-Labâ€™s subcontractorâ€™s \r\n  bid in its overall bid falls short of manifesting any assent to the terms of \r\n  the bid or the required mutual intent to be bound.Â  As a consequence, no contract \r\n  existed between the parties by virtue of Sharpâ€™s use of Electro-Labâ€™s bid.\r\nElectro-Lab argues that even \r\n  if the use of a bid by a general contractor from a subcontractor does not necessarily \r\n  form a contract, such use is indicative of the formation of a contract between \r\n  the two companies.Â  Electro-Lab asserts, based on the totality of circumstances, \r\n  that the culmination of Sharpâ€™s and Electro-Labâ€™s actions formed an enforceable \r\n  contract.Â  We disagree.Â  Following Sharpâ€™s use of Electro-Labâ€™s bid, Sharpâ€™s \r\n  project manager testified that he told Electro-Lab that its bid was low, inquired \r\n  about Electro-Labâ€™s bond rate and asked Electro-Lab to fax its bid in writing.Â  \r\n  This communication falls short of amounting to acceptance of the bid because \r\n  it does not convey any assent to the terms of the bid by a return promise or \r\n  any mutual intent to be bound.Â  Such communications were merely preliminary \r\n  negotiations between the parties and do not amount to an enforceable contact.Â  \r\n  See McLaurin v. Hamer, 165 S.C. 411, 420, 164 S.E. 2, 5 (1932) \r\n  (stating that there is no meeting of the minds between the parties when they \r\n  are merely negotiating the terms of an agreement to be entered into).Â  Similarly, \r\n  Sharpâ€™s discussions with Electro-Lab about performing the work for the $1,140,000 \r\n  were also preliminary negotiations as evidenced by Sharpâ€™s confirmatory fax \r\n  instructing Electro-Lab that â€œ[a] subcontract is forthcoming.â€ See Caulder \r\n  v. Knox, 251 S.C. 337, 345, 162 S.E.2d 262, 266 (1968) (â€œThe intention of \r\n  the parties should be determined from the surrounding circumstances, as well \r\n  as from the testimony of all witnesses; and subsequent acts are relevant to \r\n  show whether a contract was intended.â€).Â  See also Bugg v. \r\n  Bugg, 272 S.C. 122, 125, 249 S.E.2d 505, 507 (1978) (â€œWhere it is determined \r\n  that the parties intended not to be bound until the written contract is executed, \r\n  no valid and enforceable obligation will be held to arise.â€).Â  Under the totality \r\n  of the circumstances, the culmination of Sharpâ€™s actions does not evidence any \r\n  assent to the terms of the Electro-Labâ€™s bid or a mutual intent to be bound.Â  \r\n  Further, we do not find Electro-Lab, in attending the pre-construction meeting \r\n  and gathering submittals, established a mutual intent to be bound or any acceptance \r\n  by Sharp.Â  As a result, we find the conduct of Sharp and Electro-Lab following \r\n  the bid did not amount to acceptance of Electro-Labâ€™s bid and did not create \r\n  an enforceable contract. \r\nElectro-Lab also asserts that principles \r\n  of mutuality of contract require we find the parties bound in contract.Â  We \r\n  do not find the principles of mutuality of contract to be invoked under these \r\n  circumstances.Â  In support of this argument, Electro-Lab relies on Powers \r\n  Constr. Co. v. Salem Carpets, Inc., 283 S.C. 302, 322 S.E.2d 30 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984).Â Â  This case noted the doctrine of promissory estoppel could support an \r\n  action by a contractor who has submitted a prime bid in reliance upon a subcontractorâ€™s \r\n  bid.Â  Id.Â  at 306, 322 S.E.2d at 33.Â  Electro-Lab argues because, pursuant \r\n  to Powers, a subcontractor could be liable for damages under the doctrine \r\n  of promissory estoppel, principles of mutuality of contract require a general \r\n  contractor to be bound to a subcontract, or in this case, Sharp to be bound \r\n  to Electro-Lab.Â  Electro-Labâ€™s argument, however, is flawed for two significant \r\n  reasons.Â  First, the Powers case is premised on the doctrine of promissory \r\n  estoppel and not breach of contract as asserted by Electro-Lab on appeal.Â  Second, \r\n  principles of mutuality of contract only arise between parties to a contract.Â  \r\n  Because we find no enforceable contract existed, the principles of mutuality \r\n  of contract are neither invoked nor violated.\r\nBecause we agree with the conclusion \r\n  of the trial court that no enforceable contract existed between the parties, \r\n  we need not reach Electro-Labâ€™s argument concerning the sufficiency of damages.Â  \r\n  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, \r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling that an appellate court need not review \r\n  remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTRIDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3732","title":"Frame v.

We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTed Frame began his employment with RSI, a commercial \r\n  laundry business, as a route sales driver in March 1985.Â  After establishing \r\n  himself as a â€œjack of all tradesâ€ and an â€œexcellent employee,â€ Frame was promoted \r\n  to route sales manager sometime between 1991 and 1993 and again to production \r\n  manager in 1997. Â By the time he ended his employment with RSI, a family \r\n  owned business run by the five sons of founder Jerry Reeves, Frame was known \r\n  within the company as the sixth Reeves brother, having many of the same responsibilities \r\n  and ostensibly the authority of a co-owner.\r\nBoth Frame and RSI agree \r\n  that he had a very difficult and stress inducing job throughout his employment \r\n  with RSI.Â  As a route sales driver, he would often work up to fourteen hours \r\n  a day, and it was not uncommon to put in sixty to seventy hours a week. Â In \r\n  both the route sales manager and production manager positions, his responsibilities \r\n  were increased and the amount of time his job required remained around sixty \r\n  to seventy-five hours a week, depending on the season, often working weekends. \r\n  Â Furthermore, his level of job-related stress was aggravated by what \r\n  he perceived to be managementâ€™s continual incompetence, violations of law (Department \r\n  of Transportation and environmental regulations), conflicting orders, disregard \r\n  of proper chain of command, overt racism [1] , and sexual misconduct on the \r\n  part of some of his five bosses. Â Frame professed that many of the circumstances \r\n  which eventually led to his heightened level of job-related stress, particularly \r\n  racist remarks by management, reporting and receiving conflicting orders from \r\n  multiple bosses and having to rush between several different areas of the business, \r\n  had been present for about five years before the date he left the employ of \r\n  the company.\r\nThroughout his fifteen years \r\n  of employment, especially in the last five years, Frame had feelings of frustration, \r\n  helplessness and outrage at the practices of his supervisors.Â  He testified \r\n  to several instances where he fired employees for violations of the companyâ€™s \r\n  drug and alcohol policy, which he was charged to enforce, only to have the Reeves \r\n  brothers rehire them a month later.Â  There were occasions when truck maintenance, \r\n  hauling practices, and the plantâ€™s compliance with environmental regulations \r\n  were responded to with perceived apathy by the Reeves brothers.Â  Frame believed \r\n  this rose to the level of a violation of law.Â  His dissatisfaction with his \r\n  job was exacerbated throughout his employment by feelings that its demands were \r\n  destroying his family life.\r\nOn September 9, 1999, an \r\n  outside vendor of paper goods arrived at RSI with a delivery. Two boxes of paper \r\n  towels, damaged during delivery, were deemed below the quality standards of \r\n  the company and were removed from the bill. The driver of the truck, expressing \r\n  his intention of throwing the products away, instead gave the products to the \r\n  employees of RSI. One employee, driver Kevin Moore, an outstanding employee \r\n  by RSIâ€™s own testimony, took some of the towels home with him at the end of \r\n  his shift.\r\nFrame arrived to work the \r\n  following morning to find Michelle Johnson, a purchasing agent for the company \r\n  and Frameâ€™s subordinate, loudly accusing Moore of being a thief.Â  Frame attempted \r\n  to explain to Johnson the situation, namely that the paper products were given \r\n  free of charge from the vendor, but Johnson continued to accuse Moore and seek \r\n  action from Frame. When Frame became annoyed by Johnsonâ€™s continual finger pointing, \r\n  he inquired into the cost of the paper towels had the company been charged by \r\n  the vendor, wrote the company a check for that amount (about thirty-five dollars) \r\n  and handed it to Johnson.\r\nThe Reeves brothers were \r\n  conducting a family business meeting on the day in question.Â  Johnson, alleged \r\n  paramour of Michael Reeves, quickly approached him as he left the meeting and \r\n  told him of the events of the day.  \r\n  [2] Â  Michael Reeves, siding with his alleged girlfriend, sought out Frame \r\n  and explained to him that it was a violation of company policy to allow an employee \r\n  to receive free items. According to Frame, Michael Reeves expanded on the policy \r\n  by adding, â€œ[Kevin Moore] is a thief and liar.Â  [A]ll black people are thieves \r\n  and liars and . . . youâ€™ve got to watch out for it.â€Â  \r\nOver Frameâ€™s assertions \r\n  that Moore was innocent of any wrongdoing, Michael Reeves continued to state \r\n  his position on the alleged towel theft until Frame suffered a complete mental \r\n  breakdown. In his own words, â€œI think really what topped the notch was with \r\n  Michelle and the paper products that said that Kevin stole and then Michael \r\n  told me that blacks were all thieves and liars.Â  I think thatâ€™s what really \r\n  snapped.â€Â  Frame told his boss to leave Moore alone, placed his pager and phone \r\n  down, went out to his truck and started crying. Â He never returned to \r\n  work in his previous capacity.\r\nAfter expressing to family \r\n  and friends his breakdown and an onslaught of suicidal tendencies following \r\n  the above incident, Frame was examined by a psychologist and a psychiatrist.Â  \r\n  The psychiatrist and psychologist agree: (1) that Frame suffers from a bipolar \r\n  type of psychosis; (2) on the day in question he experienced what is known as \r\n  a â€œdecompensationâ€ (a mental breakdown); (3) there is a certain genetic predisposition \r\n  to this kind of psychosis; (4) this â€œdecompensationâ€ was the result of job-related \r\n  stress; and (5) it was in no way certain that Frame would experience such a \r\n  mental collapse regardless of exterior stimuli (i.e., his job).Â  According to \r\n  the psychiatrist and psychologist, Frame is not currently capable of full-time \r\n  work.\r\nFrame claimed entitlement \r\n  to benefits under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  A hearing before a single \r\n  commissioner resulted in an order granting Frame full benefits.Â  The order of \r\n  the single commissioner reads: \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The Claimant was predisposed to mental illness, although it is unclear whether \r\n  the predisposition was as a result of genetics or something else.Â  The basis \r\n  of the predisposition is not relevant.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The Claimantâ€™s work stress was a contributing factor to the decompensation and \r\n  was the major contributing factor.\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Particular stressors in the workplace included:Â  answering to â€œfive bossesâ€; \r\n  the constant anxiety resulting from escalating pressure associated with being \r\n  on call.Â  Other examples were trying to cut costs without cooperation, insufficient \r\n  fire extinguishers to put out fires in the plant, conflict with DOT standards \r\n  or regulations, lack of cooperation from mechanics and drivers, etc.\r\n. . . .\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Under Section 42-1-160, Claimant did sustain a mental injury by repeated stresses, \r\n  and specific trigger event, arising out of and in the course of his employment \r\n  within the meaning therein.\r\n\r\nRSI appealed the order of \r\n  the single commissioner to the Full Commission.Â  The Full Commission adopted \r\n  the order of the single commissioner.Â  The order of the Full Commission states:\r\n\r\nIn an Appellate Review, \r\n  the Commission has the power to weigh the evidence as presented at the initial \r\n  hearing and, after careful review in the instant case, the Commission, by majority \r\n  vote, has determined that all of the Hearing Commissionerâ€™s Findings of Fact \r\n  and Rulings of Law are correct as stated.Â  Accordingly, they shall become, and \r\n  hereby are, the law of the case; and therefore, the Order is sustained in its \r\n  entirety.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe Order of the Single \r\n  Commissioner filed in the above entitled matter on December 21, 2000, is hereby \r\n  affirmed by the Panel and same shall constitute the Decision and Order of the \r\n  Appellate Panel.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the circuit court \r\n  affirmed the findings of the Full Commission.Â  The order of the circuit court \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nOn appeal to the commission \r\n  tribunal, the law of mental injury on the job, without accompanying physical \r\n  injury, was extensively debated by both counsel in their briefs and in their \r\n  argument.\r\n. . . .\r\nThe tribunalâ€™s order was \r\n  based on their detailed knowledge of the facts of this case and their intimate \r\n  knowledge of the law as relates to mental injury on the job, but said order \r\n  does not cite such specifics even while upholding the rulings of the single \r\n  commissioner.\r\n. . . . \r\nThe single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  opinion noted a specific trigger event for Frameâ€™s mental injury, arising from \r\n  the facts specified on the date in question, such substantial evidence leading \r\n  one to reasonably conclude that such facts represent unusual and extraordinary \r\n  conditions of the employment, notwithstanding any conflicting argument which \r\n  reasonably could also be made.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act governs the standard of review in a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision.Â  \r\n  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002);Â  Gray \r\n  v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 528 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2000); Lake \r\n  v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 498 S.E.2d 650 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In \r\n  an appeal from the Commission, this court may not substitute its judgment for \r\n  that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, \r\n  but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Hamilton \r\n  v. Bob Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 518 S.E.2d 599 (Ct. App. 1999); Stephen \r\n  v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (Supp. 2001); see also Etheredge v. \r\n  Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating court \r\n  may reverse or modify Commissionâ€™s decision if substantial rights of appellant \r\n  have been prejudiced because administrative findings, inferences, conclusions \r\n  or decisions are affected by other error of law).Â  This courtâ€™s review is limited \r\n  to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial \r\n  evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, \r\n  Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. \r\n  Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); see also \r\n  Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993) (in reviewing decision of Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, Court \r\n  of Appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported by \r\n  substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law).\r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of \r\n  evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is \r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds \r\n  to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify \r\n  its action.Â  Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 456, 562 S.E.2d at 681-82; Broughton \r\n  v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The \r\n  Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and \r\n  is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Muir v. C.R. \r\n  Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination \r\n  of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to \r\n  the Appellate Panel.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  438 (2000); Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 \r\n  (1995); Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729.Â  The findings of \r\n  an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if \r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., \r\n  343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., \r\n  335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999).Â  It is not within our province to reverse \r\n  findings of the Commission which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Broughton, \r\n  336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFrame asserts that he has \r\n  suffered an accidental injury within the scope and course of his employment \r\n  with RSI pursuant to section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina Code, and is entitled \r\n  to benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act for his mental \r\n  illness.Â  RSI contends there is no â€œinjuryâ€ as defined by the statute.\r\nMental injuries are compensable \r\n  if they are induced either by physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary \r\n  conditions of employment.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, \r\n  493, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001); Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., \r\n  335 S.C. 77, 80, 515 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 1999); Stokes v. First Natâ€™l \r\n  Bank, 298 S.C. 13, 21, 377 S.E.2d 922, 926 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  A mental-mental \r\n  injury is a purely mental injury resulting from emotional stimuli.Â  Shealy \r\n  v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).\r\n\r\nMental or nervous disorders \r\n  are compensable accidental injuries under the statute when â€œthe emotional stimuli \r\n  or stressors are incident to or arise from unusual or extraordinary conditions \r\n  of employment.â€Â  Powell v. Vulcan Materials, Co., 299 S.C. 325, 384 S.E.2d \r\n  725 (1989).Â  In Powell, this Court held that courts should use the â€œheart \r\n  attack standardâ€ to determine when a mental-mental injury is compensable.Â  A \r\n  heart attack suffered by an employee constitutes a compensable accident if it \r\n  is induced by unexpected strain or overexertion in the performance of his duties \r\n  of employment, or by unusual and extraordinary conditions in employment.Â  Bridges \r\n  v. Housing Auth., City of Charleston, 278 S.C. 342, 295 S.E.2d 872 (1982).Â  \r\n  However, if a heart attack results as a consequence of ordinary exertion that \r\n  is required in performance of employment duties in an ordinary and usual manner, \r\n  and without any untoward event, it is not compensable as an accident.Â  Fulmer \r\n  v. South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 306 S.C. 34, 410 S.E.2d 25 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991).Â  According to this Court in Powell, the heart attack standard \r\n  applies to mental-mental injuries:\r\n  \r\nMental or nervous disorders \r\n  resulting from either physical or emotional stimuli are equally compensable \r\n  provided the emotional stimuli or stressors are incident to or arise from unusual \r\n  or extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  Powell, 299 S.C. at 327, \r\n  384 S.E.2d at 726; see also, Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 306 S.C. \r\n  46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991).\r\n  \r\n\r\nShealy, 341 S.C. \r\n  at 457, 535 S.E.2d at 443.Â  The requirement of â€œunusual or extraordinary conditions \r\n  in employmentâ€ for a claimant to recover for a mental-mental injury refers to \r\n  conditions to the particular job in which the injury occurs, not to conditions \r\n  of employment in general.Â  Id. at 456, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  \r\n\r\nIn order for [a claimant] \r\n  to recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits, he must prove both: (1) that he was \r\n  exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in his employment; and (2) that \r\n  these unusual and extraordinary conditions were the proximate cause of his mental \r\n  breakdown.Â  See generally Powell, supra; Gambrell v. \r\n  Burleson, 252 S.C. 98, 165 S.E.2d 622 (1969) (must prove causal connection \r\n  between injury and subsequent condition in workersâ€™ compensation cases).\r\n\r\nId. at 459, 535 S.E.2d at 444.\r\nWe find the Full Commission, \r\n  as the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases, failed to sufficiently \r\n  specify its factual findings to the degree required by the amended statute.Â  \r\n  See Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000) \r\n  (holding the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission is the ultimate finder of fact).Â  \r\n  Specifically, by simply adopting the order of the single commissioner, no \r\n  finding of â€œextraordinary or unusual circumstancesâ€ leading to the injury was \r\n  articulated.Â  \r\nFrame relies on Powell \r\n  v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299 S.C. 325, 384 S.E.2d 725 (1989), for the proposition \r\n  that a work-related altercation could legally amount to an â€œunusual and extraordinaryâ€ \r\n  condition of employment notwithstanding the lack of any specific stated finding \r\n  on the issue.Â  Frameâ€™s reading of the case is misguided. \r\nIn 1996, partially in response \r\n  to Powell, the legislature amended section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code to include the following provisions:\r\n\r\nStress arising out of and \r\n  in the course of employment unaccompanied by physical injury and resulting in \r\n  mental illness or injury is not a personal injury unless it is established \r\n  that the stressful employment conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary \r\n  and unusual to the normal conditions of the employment.\r\n[A mental injury] is not \r\n  considered compensable if it results from any event or series of events which \r\n  is incidental to normal employer/employee relations such asâ€¦ [nonexclusive \r\n  list]â€¦ except when these actions are taken in an extraordinary and unusual \r\n  manner.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 \r\n  (Supp. 2002) (emphasis added).\r\nWhile this amendment \r\n  maintains the part of Powell that held a purely mental injury compensable \r\n  under the statute, it adds the requirement, non-existent when the court decided \r\n  Powell, that the finder of fact make a specific finding that such an \r\n  injury arose from â€œextraordinary and unusualâ€ circumstances.Â  The circumstances \r\n  must be â€œextraordinary and unusualâ€ in regard to the particular employment in \r\n  question and not as applied to some general notion of the average reasonable \r\n  employment. See Shealy, 341 S.C. at 457, 535 S.E.2d at 443.Â  \r\nFrame argues, per the â€œsubstantial \r\n  evidenceâ€ rule and this courtâ€™s standard of review, that the record provides \r\n  a significant number of facts to allow a reasonable person to conclude his injury \r\n  was a result of unusual and extraordinary conditions.Â  We agree that a reasonable \r\n  mind could possibly make such a finding based on the evidence of this case.Â  \r\n  The issue here, however, is not whether such conclusion could be reached as \r\n  an issue of fact, but rather, was such conclusion reached as required by law.Â  \r\n\r\nThe findings of fact made \r\n  by the Full Commission must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing \r\n  court to determine whether the evidence supports the findings.Â  Parsons v. \r\n  Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 66, 456 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1995).Â  The mere \r\n  mention of a â€œspecific trigger eventâ€ by the single commissioner, later cited \r\n  by the circuit court as proof that this required finding was made, is not a \r\n  satisfactory showing that the Full Commission found the conditions on the date \r\n  of Frameâ€™s decompensation â€œextraordinary and unusual to the normal conditions \r\n  of the employment.â€Â  Although evidence on record indicates that this may very \r\n  well have been the case, â€œthe reviewing court may not make findings of fact \r\n  as to basic issues of liability for compensation, where, to do so, would impose \r\n  upon the court the function of determining such facts from conflicting evidence.â€Â  \r\n  Fox v. Newberry County Memâ€™l Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, \r\n  394 (1995).Â  When an administrative agency acts without first making the proper \r\n  factual findings required by law, the proper procedure is to remand the case \r\n  and allow the agency the opportunity to make those findings.Â  See id.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the order of \r\n  the circuit court and remand this case to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  to make the appropriate findings of fact on the issue of whether the stressful \r\n  employment conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual \r\n  to the normal conditions of employment of Frame.Â  Accordingly, the case is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. and CURETON, A.J. concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Frame, a Caucasian, was often troubled by the dishonorable treatment \r\n    African-American employees under his charge received from upper management, \r\n    exacerbated by comments by certain members of the Reeves family.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Although Frame asserted that the adulterous relationship \r\n    between Michael Reeves and Michelle Johnson was common knowledge within the \r\n    company, he offered no proof at the hearing and admitted to never actually \r\n    witnessing intimate sexual relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3733","title":"Smith v.

Bryant, III, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\nS. Jahue Moore and M. Ronald McMahan, Jr., of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This case asks us to determine whether \r\n  an estate owned by Ernest Smith and his wife, Joanne Rucker, is subject to partition.Â  \r\n  The case was heard by a master-in-equity, who partitioned the property after \r\n  finding that the parties owned it as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, \r\n  a cotenancy subject to partition. Wife appeals, arguing the property is not \r\n  subject to partition because she and her Husband own the property as tenants \r\n  in common for life with indestructible survivorship rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married in June 2000.Â  On August \r\n  17, 2000, Wife deeded Husband a one-half interest in her home and land.Â  The \r\n  deed contained a granting clause that gave the property to Husband and Wife \r\n  â€œfor and during their joint lives and upon the death of either of them, then \r\n  to the survivor of them, his or her heirs and assigns forever in fee simple, \r\n  together with every contingent remainder and right of reversion.â€Â  The habendum \r\n  clause used similar language, providing Husband and Wife owned the property, \r\n  â€œfor and during their joint lives and upon the death of either of them, then \r\n  to the survivor of them, his or her heirs and assigns whomever lawfully claiming, \r\n  or to claim the same, or any party thereof.â€ \r\nHusband filed a complaint in the court of common \r\n  pleas seeking partition of the subject property, and the case was referred to \r\n  a master-in-equity.Â  The master granted Husbandâ€™s motion for summary judgment, \r\n  finding the parties owned the real property at issue as joint tenants with rights \r\n  of survivorship. As such, the master held the property could be partitioned \r\n  pursuant to section 15-61-10 of the South Carolina Code. [1] Â  Wife appeals, arguing the parties owned the \r\n  property as tenants in common for life with indestructible survivorship rights.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe deed at hand unquestionably creates survivorship \r\n  rights.Â  The crux of this case is whether those survivorship rights are paired \r\n  with a tenancy in common and therefore indestructible or whether they are paired \r\n  with a joint tenancy, in which case the property would be subject to partition \r\n  at the whim of either party.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-40 (Supp. 2002); \r\n  Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. 182, 75 S.E.2d 46 (1953).Â  We find that the \r\n  deed created a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship and affirm the masterâ€™s \r\n  decision to partition the property.\r\nSection 27-7-40 of the South Carolina Code provides \r\n  that a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship is conclusively established \r\n  when a deed grants land to two or more persons â€œas joint tenants with rights \r\n  of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.â€Â  However, this language is not \r\n  the only means by which joint tenancies are created, but rather is â€œ[i]n addition \r\n  to any other methods for the creation of a joint tenancy in real estate which \r\n  may exist by law . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-40 (Supp. 2002).\r\nThe common law method of creating a joint tenancy \r\n  requires a conveyance to have four unities: unity of interest, unity of title, \r\n  unity of time, and unity of possession.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 8 S.C.L. \r\n  (1 Mill) 48 (1817).Â Â Â Â Â  When a joint tenancy is coupled with a right of survivorship, \r\n  the right of survivorship can, under certain circumstances, be destroyed by \r\n  one party acting alone.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-40 (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  Because survivorship rights often encumber land, our courts require clear, unambiguous, \r\n  and express language to create a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship and \r\n  will construe instruments in favor of tenancies in common whenever possible.Â  \r\n  Herbemont v. Thomas, Chev.Eq. 21 (S.C. 1839).Â  The reason South Carolina \r\n  courts favor tenancies in common over joint tenancies is due to â€œthe harsh results \r\n  of survivorship rights incident to joint tenanc[ies] [which] usually defeated \r\n  the intention of the grantor.â€ 6 S.C. Jur. Cotenancies Â§ 18 (1991).Â Â  \r\n  We do not believe this general rule favoring tenancies in common is applicable \r\n  to cases involving deeds that unequivocally grant rights of survivorship because \r\n  construing a deed to convey a tenancy in common with a right of survivorship \r\n  would result in finding an estate that has indestructible survivorship rights \r\n  and would thereby render the land less rather than more marketable.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., Harold W. Jacobs, Cotenancies, Estates of in South Carolina, \r\n  11 S.C.L.Q. 520, 523 (1958) (explaining that South Carolina courts favor estates \r\n  that do not have harsh survivorship rules).Â  \r\nAlthough the deed in the instant case does not \r\n  contain the language suggested by section 27-7-40, it does satisfy the four \r\n  unities required to create a joint tenancy: both Husband and Wife have the same \r\n  interest, created by the same conveyance, which commenced at the same time, \r\n  and they hold the property in undivided possession.Â  Furthermore, the deed clearly \r\n  and unambiguously grants the right of survivorship, a distinguishing characteristic \r\n  of joint tenancies. 6 S.C. Jur. Cotenancies Â§ 17 (1991) (â€œThe distinguishing \r\n  characteristic of joint estates is survivorship.â€).Â  Thus, we find the language \r\n  of the deed unambiguously created a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship.Â  \r\n  See Lake View Acres Development Co. v. Tindal, 306 S.C. 477, 479, \r\n  412 S.E.2d 457, 458 (Ct. App. 1991) (â€œThe main object in construing a deed is \r\n  to ascertain the intention of the grantor from the language used in the deed.â€). \r\n  [2] \r\nIn support of her position that the property is not \r\n  subject to partition, Wife relies on Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. 182, 75 \r\n  S.E.2d 46 (1953), in which our supreme court recognized indestructible survivorship \r\n  rights attaching to a tenancy in common.Â  However, in that case, the court was \r\n  called upon to determine what quantum of estate was created by a deed that purported \r\n  to create a tenancy by the entirety [3]  after such estates were no longer recognized in South Carolina. \r\n  [4] Â  Here, the deed did not purport to create a tenancy by the entirety.Â  \r\n  Instead, as explained above, Wifeâ€™s deed created a joint tenancy by satisfying \r\n  the four unities required under common law and by unambiguously creating a right \r\n  of survivorship.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the language of the deed and South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  penchant for construing deeds in favor of marketability, we find Wifeâ€™s deed \r\n  created a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship.Â  As a joint tenancy, the \r\n  property is subject to partition pursuant to section 15-61-10 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code.Â  Accordingly, the masterâ€™s decision to partition the property isÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Section 15-61-10 states: â€œAll joint tenants and tenants in common \r\n    who hold, jointly or in common, for a term of life or years or of whom one \r\n    has an estate for a term of life or years with the other that has an estate \r\n    of inheritance or freehold in any land, tenements or hereditaments shall be \r\n    compelled to make severance and partition of all such lands, tenements and \r\n    hereditaments.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; When the language in a deed is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence \r\n    is admissible to aid the court in determining the grantorâ€™s intentions.Â  See \r\n    Bellamy v. Bellamy, 292 S.C. 107, 111, 355 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\n    Here, extrinsic evidence was unnecessary because we find the language of the \r\n    deed sufficiently clear to create a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship. \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] &nbsp; Tenancies by the entirety, which were premised on the \r\n    common law fiction that a man and woman merged into one person upon marriage, \r\n    were recognized as valid estates in South Carolina until 1907.Â  Green v. \r\n    Cannady, 77 S.C. 193, 57 S.E. 832 (1907).Â  Because of the â€œunity of personâ€ \r\n    notion, property conveyed to spouses was automatically deemed a tenancy by \r\n    the entirety, and as such, neither Husband nor Wife could convey or alienate \r\n    the property without the otherâ€™s permission and the surviving spouse was entitled \r\n    to the entire estate upon the otherâ€™s death.Â  In Green v. Cannady, \r\n    the supreme court abolished tenancies by the entirety, finding that the Married \r\n    Womanâ€™s Separate Property Acts and the state constitutions of 1868 and 1895 \r\n    effectively destroyed the fiction that, upon marriage, a couple merged into \r\n    one, unified person.Â  Instead, the Green court held that property titled \r\n    to both Husband and Wife created a tenancy in common.Â  Id. at 197, \r\n    57 S.E. at 834.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] &nbsp; When called upon to determine what quantum of estate the \r\n    deed actually created, the Davis court held that a tenancy in common \r\n    with indestructible survivorship rights was created either because the cotenants \r\n    had â€œ(1) a tenancy in common for life with a contingent remainder in favor \r\n    of the survivorâ€ or â€œ(2) a tenancy in common in fee simple with an executory \r\n    limitation in favor of the survivor.â€ Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. 182, \r\n    192, 75 S.E.2d 46, 50 (1953).Â  In reaching its decision, the court â€œapproached \r\n    the question . . . by first undertaking to ascertain the intention of the \r\n    parties . . . .â€Â  Id. at 185, 75 S.E.2d at 47.In doing this, the court \r\n    found that the purported creation of a tenancy by the entirety â€œ[threw] some \r\n    light on the intention to create an indestructible right of survivorshipâ€ \r\n    and that â€œby adding the phrase â€˜and the survivor of them,â€™ the parties . . \r\n    . clearly indicated the nature of the estate intended to be created, namely \r\n    that upon the death of either of the grantees the absolute estate should vest \r\n    in the survivor.â€Â  Id. at 191-192, 75 S.E.2d at 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3734","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

In 1999, Leigha was taken into emergency protective custody after \r\n  Mother left her with friends in Hilton Head, supposedly for a day, and did not \r\n  return after two weeks. Mother had a serious drug problem, and her whereabouts \r\n  were unknown at the time of the TPR hearing. \r\nAt the hearing, Father testified that during the time \r\n  he and Mother were together, she did not have a drug problem and was a good \r\n  mother.Â  He further testified that he was very active in his daughterâ€™s life, \r\n  though he offered very few details.Â  \r\nFather admitted that while he was in prison, he attempted \r\n  to contact Leigha on only two occasions.Â  According to his testimony, his first \r\n  attempt occurred when he asked prison officials to help him locate his daughter.Â  \r\n  When they did not help him, Father became frustrated and did nothing else.Â  \r\n  His second attempt occurred when he sent Leigha a birthday card by way of her \r\n  older half-sister, [1]  but the \r\n  card was returned as undeliverable.Â  According to Fatherâ€™s own testimony, no \r\n  other attempts were made to contact his daughter.\r\nDSS attempted to locate Father, but the only information \r\n  it received from Mother was that he was incarcerated in Georgia.Â  When asked \r\n  if he did anything to aid in DSSâ€™s search for him, Father stated:Â  â€œI remained \r\n  breathing oxygen.â€Â  Eventually, a caseworker found him through the Internet \r\n  listings of the Georgia Department of Corrections, and in January of 2001, he \r\n  was served with a summons and complaint to terminate his parental rights.Â  \r\nEven after learning of the TPR, Father failed to establish \r\n  any contact with the caseworker or DSS.Â  The caseworker testified that Father \r\n  knew or should have known how to contact her or DSS from the time he received \r\n  the summons and complaint in January of 2001.Â  Father also made no attempt to \r\n  contact the guardian for the minor child until after he was released from prison, \r\n  about one week prior to the TPR hearing.Â  \r\nDSS sought to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights on \r\n  the grounds that he abandoned his daughter, he willfully failed to visit within \r\n  the previous six months, and he willfully failed to provide support during the \r\n  previous six months.Â  Father denied the allegations.Â  \r\nThe family court found that Father abandoned his daughter \r\n  and that TPR was in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  In making this finding, the \r\n  family court explicitly stated that Fatherâ€™s testimony was without credibility \r\n  and was completely self-serving.Â  Father appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA ground for termination of parental rights must be \r\n  proved by clear and convincing evidence.â€Â  Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\n  Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998) (citing Greenville \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 437 S.E.2d 107 (1993)).Â  \r\n  â€œIn reviewing a termination of parental rights, the appellate court has the \r\n  authority to review the record and make its own findings of whether clear and \r\n  convincing evidence supports the termination.â€Â  Earles, 330 S.C. at 24, \r\n  496 S.E.2d at 868 (citing S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Brown, 317 S.C. \r\n  332, 454 S.E.2d 335 (Ct. App. 1995)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather maintains the family court erred both \r\n  in finding that he had abandoned daughter and in finding that termination of \r\n  his parental rights would serve her best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to section 20-7-1572(7) of the South \r\n  Carolina Code, the court can terminate the rights of a parent who abandons his \r\n  or her child if termination of those rights is in the childâ€™s best interest.Â Â  \r\n  Abandonment occurs when â€œa parent or guardian willfully deserts a child or willfully \r\n  surrenders physical possession of a child without making adequate arrangements \r\n  for the childâ€™s needs or the continuing care of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-490(19) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\nWillfulness is â€œa question of intent \r\n  to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 336, 543 S.E.2d 580, 582 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (citing S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 \r\n  S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992)).Â  â€œOur supreme court has defined willfulness as â€˜[c]onduct \r\n  of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . \r\n  . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to \r\n  receive support and consortium from the parent.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Broome, \r\n  307 S.C. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839).Â  â€œGenerally, the family court is given wide \r\n  discretion in making this determination.Â  However, the element of willfulness \r\n  must be established by clear and convincing evidence.â€Â  Id.\r\nFather argues that the only evidence of \r\n  abandonment was his incarceration and that incarceration alone is insufficient \r\n  to terminate his parental rights.Â  We agree that pursuant to South Carolina \r\n  Department of Social Services v. Wilson, incarceration alone is insufficient \r\n  to justify termination.Â  However, in Wilson, the incarcerated father \r\n  made extensive efforts to maintain contact with his children, but DSS prevented \r\n  the visitation.Â  The Wilson court held: â€œThe record contains overwhelming \r\n  evidence that SCDSS not only refused to facilitate visitation, it actually took \r\n  an active role in preventing the father from visiting his children.Â  Despite \r\n  the fatherâ€™s repeated requests, the caseworkers refused to allow visitation \r\n  both at the correctional facility and after the review hearings.â€Â  344 S.C. \r\n  at 338, 543 S.E.2d at 583.\r\n In the instant case, aside from unsuccessfully \r\n  sending Leigha a birthday card via her older half-sister, Father admitted he \r\n  only attempted to locate his daughter one time and that his effort to find her \r\n  ended when prison officials were unhelpful.Â Â Â  Even after learning Leigha was \r\n  in DSSâ€™s custody, Father made no attempt to inquire about her health and wellbeing.Â  \r\n  Father neither made arrangements for his childâ€™s care nor showed concern for \r\n  the status of her current arrangements.Â  Unlike the father in Wilson, \r\n  Father made only a miniscule attempt to remain a part of his daughterâ€™s life \r\n  while in prison.Â Â Â  In addition to â€œbreathing oxygen,â€ Father was required to \r\n  take the necessary steps to assure that his daughter was being continually cared \r\n  for, and because he failed to do this, we find he effectively abandoned her.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(19) (defining abandonment as the willful \r\n  surrender of a child by a parent without making adequate arrangements for the \r\n  childâ€™s continuing care). \r\nFather asserts that he did not abandon \r\n  his daughter because he left her in Motherâ€™s care when he was initially incarcerated.Â  \r\n  However, based on the language of section 20-7-490(19), a parentâ€™s responsibility \r\n  extends beyond making initial arrangements for his or her child while the parent \r\n  is away; the statute requires that the parent make adequate arrangements for \r\n  the childâ€™s continuing care. Thus, even if we believe Fatherâ€™s testimony \r\n  that Mother had been a qualified caregiver at the time of his incarceration, \r\n  [2]  he had an ongoing responsibility to make efforts to ensure that his \r\n  daughter was continually cared for while he was serving his sentence.Â  Because \r\n  Father willfully failed to either inquire about his daughter or verify that \r\n  Mother was indeed taking care of her, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s \r\n  determination that Father abandoned his child.Â  Furthermore, based on the lack \r\n  of recent contact between Father and Leigha, the guardian ad litemâ€™s testimony \r\n  that termination is in Leighaâ€™s best interest, and the foster motherâ€™s testimony \r\n  about Leighaâ€™s current living situation, we agree with the family court that \r\n  termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights is in Leighaâ€™s best interest.\r\n Father next argues that the family court \r\n  judgeâ€™s questions of him displayed bias.Â  After having been examined and cross-examined \r\n  by his attorney and the attorney for DSS, Father then fielded over thirty questions \r\n  from the family court judge.Â  While we believe this questioning was certainly \r\n  excessive and unnecessarily harsh, we find that, ultimately, it did not adversely \r\n  affect the outcome of the proceedings.\r\nIn Fowler v. Laney Tank Lines, Inc., \r\n  263 S.C. 422, 211 S.E.2d 231 (1975), the court reiterated â€œthe sound and long \r\n  established rule that â€˜the trial judge, of course, has the right, in his discretion, \r\n  and in a proper manner, to question witnesses during a trial, in order to elicit \r\n  the truth.â€™â€Â  Id. at 425, 211 at 232 (quoting Williams v. S.C. Farm \r\n  Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 464, 163 S.E.2d 212 (1968)).Â  The foremost \r\n  danger in a judge asking a witness questions is that the nature of the questioning \r\n  might indicate to the jury how the judge feels about a particular witnessâ€™s \r\n  testimony or how the case itself should be resolved.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Williams v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 464, 472, 163 S.E.2d \r\n  212, 216 (1968) (â€œIf a trial judge in the exercise of his discretion feels called \r\n  upon . . . to question witnesses to elicit the truth, he should be cautious \r\n  to see that such questions are propounded in a fair and impartial manner, and \r\n  should not express or indicate to the jury the judgeâ€™s opinion . . . .â€).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the family court judge questioned Father \r\n  at length about his incarceration and whether he accepted any responsibility \r\n  for his daughter being in foster care.Â  The judge repeated many questions even \r\n  after receiving answers from Father.Â  Although we believe the form of the judgeâ€™s \r\n  questions was adversarial and the number of questions was excessive, we also \r\n  acknowledge that the family court judge was the fact-finder at this hearing; \r\n  thus, the â€œforemost dangerâ€ of judicial questioning, i.e., tainting the jury, \r\n  is not present in this case.Â  Moreover, we find ample evidence in the trial \r\n  record to support the family court judgeâ€™s decision to terminate Fatherâ€™s rights.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Leighaâ€™s half-sister is Motherâ€™s daughter from \r\n    a previous relationship.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The family court judge discounted Fatherâ€™s testimony regarding whether \r\n    Mother was a qualified caregiver at the time of Fatherâ€™s incarceration.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3735","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, of Columbia; Solicitor Warren \r\n  Blair Giese, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â Â  Alvin \r\n  Simuel was convicted and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment for escaping \r\n  from the Kirkland Correctional Center.Â  He appeals, asserting the trial judge \r\n  erred in sentencing him to an enhanced penalty when the enhancement element \r\n  was neither charged in the indictment nor submitted to the jury.Â  We reverse \r\n  and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nWhile serving a fifteen-year \r\n  sentence for armed robbery, Simuel escaped from the Kirkland Correctional Center \r\n  in January 1976.Â  In 1999, he was apprehended by authorities in Massachusetts.Â  \r\n  After extradition to South Carolina, Simuel was indicted for escape.Â  The body \r\n  of the indictment read:Â  â€œThat Alvin Simuel did in Richland County on or about \r\n  January 25, 1976, unlawfully escape or attempt to escape from lawful confinement \r\n  or custody, to wit:Â  escape while serving time for armed robbery at the Kirkland \r\n  Correctional Center on 4344 Broad River Road.â€Â  \r\nThe statutory section in effect in January \r\n  1976 regarding escape read, in relevant part, as follows: \r\n\r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person, being lawfully confined \r\n  in any prison . . . to escape . . . and any person so doing . . . shall be guilty \r\n  of a misdemeanor and punished by a sentence of not less than six months nor \r\n  more than two years, such sentence to be consecutive to the original sentence \r\n  and to any other sentences theretofore imposed upon such escapee by any court \r\n  of this State . . . . Provided however, that should \r\n  the escapee be recaptured elsewhere than in this State the sentence to be imposed \r\n  in addition to any remaining unserved portion of the original sentence shall \r\n  be not less than one year nor more than three years, such sentence to be \r\n  consecutive to any other sentences theretofore imposed upon such escapee by \r\n  any court of this State.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 55-6 (1962 &amp; Supp. 1975) (italics in \r\n  original, emphasis added). [1] \r\nDuring sentencing, defense counsel objected, \r\n  arguing the indictment did not specify Simuel was taken into custody outside \r\n  of South Carolina. [2] Â  Counsel \r\n  argued the trial court could not sentence him to an enhanced penalty because \r\n  the indictment failed to allege this element.Â  The trial judge denied Simuelâ€™s \r\n  motion, stating: â€œEnhancement of penalty is not an element of the crime.â€Â  Simuel \r\n  was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment, to be served consecutively with \r\n  Simuelâ€™s underlying sentence of fifteen years for armed robbery.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSimuel argues the trial court erred in \r\n  sentencing him to an enhanced penalty when the enhancement element of being \r\n  apprehended in another state was not charged in the indictment or submitted \r\n  to the jury.Â  We agree.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of sentence enhancement \r\n  in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).Â  In Apprendi, \r\n  the defendant fired several shots into the home of an African-American family.Â  \r\n  The defendant was indicted on a weapons charge, but not under the hate crime \r\n  statute, which provided for an enhanced sentence.Â  After pleading guilty, the \r\n  trial judge granted the Stateâ€™s motion to enhance the defendantâ€™s sentence under \r\n  the hate crime statute.Â  The Supreme Court reversed, holding:Â  â€œOther than the \r\n  fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime \r\n  beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.â€  [3] Â  Id. at 490.Â  The Court noted the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment â€œcommands the same answerâ€ in cases concerning state statutes.Â  Id. \r\n  at 476. \r\nIn the instant case, Simuelâ€™s indictment \r\n  did not mention the sentence enhancement incurred when an escapee is recaptured \r\n  outside the state of South Carolina.Â  Nor did Simuelâ€™s indictment allege that \r\n  he was recaptured in Massachusetts.Â  Additionally, the enhancement provision \r\n  of section 24-13-410 was not submitted to the jury.Â  As such, under the holding \r\n  of Apprendi, the trial judge erred in enhancing Simuelâ€™s sentence in \r\n  excess of the maximum two-year sentence provided for by section 24-13-410.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Simuelâ€™s \r\n  enhanced thirty-month sentence for escape violated the holding in Apprendi, \r\n  we reverse and remand for sentencing consistent with our holding in this case.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The current statutory section is S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 24-13-410 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Further, the jury instructions did not include any mention of a statutory \r\n    sentence enhancement provision.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  We note the Fourth Circuit has found that Apprendi \r\n    is not implicated when the trial judge makes factual findings increasing the \r\n    sentencing range; however, such analysis is not applicable here, as the trial \r\n    judge did not make factual findings.Â  See United States v.

Shupe, of Columbia; and Solicitor W. \r\n  Townes Jones, IV, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n HEARN, C.J.:Â  During the \r\n  sentencing phase of his guilty plea, Michael Higgins asked the trial court to \r\n  be credited for time served while he was released on bond but placed on house \r\n  arrest.Â  The trial court denied this request, and Higgins appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHiggins was arrested and indicted for accessory \r\n  after the fact to murder.Â  He was released on a $50,000 bond, which contained \r\n  the following conditions:Â Â  \r\n\r\n[N]o contact with the victim or the victimâ€™s family in any \r\n  manner either directly or indirectly; The Defendant must remain on House Arrest \r\n  and reside with his grandmother [in] â€¦ Laurens, South Carolina and may not leave \r\n  the residence except for medical appointments or treatment, consultations with \r\n  his attorney, or for employment reasons.\r\n\r\nHiggins remained under house \r\n  arrest from the date of his release, July 24, 2001, until August 13, 2002.Â  \r\n  There is no evidence that Higgins violated the conditions imposed in the release \r\n  order.Â  On August 13, Higgins entered a negotiated Alford \r\n  [1]  plea to misprision of a felony, a lesser included offense of accessory \r\n  after the fact to murder.Â  \r\nDuring sentencing, defense counsel argued \r\n  that Higgins should be given credit for time served on house arrest.Â  The trial \r\n  court disagreed, and held that credit would only be given for the seven months \r\n  and eleven days Higgins actually spent in jail.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Higgins contends that under \r\n  section 24-13-40 of the South Carolina Code (1989 &amp; Supp. 2002), the applicable \r\n  sentencing statute, he was entitled to receive credit for the time he spent \r\n  under house arrest prior to sentencing.Â  Section 24-13-40 provides, in pertinent \r\n  part:\r\n\r\nIn every case in computing the time served by a prisoner, \r\n  full credit against the sentence shall be given for time served prior to trial \r\n  and sentencing.Â  Provided, however, that credit for time served prior \r\n  to trial and sentencing shall not be given: (1) when the prisoner at the time \r\n  he was imprisoned prior to trial was an escapee from another penal institution; \r\n  or (2) when the prisoner is serving a sentence for one offense and is awaiting \r\n  trial and sentence for a second offense in which case he shall not receive credit \r\n  for time served prior to trial in reduction of his sentence for the second offense.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  In support of his argument, Higgins \r\n  asserts that because house arrest is not specifically excluded by the statute, \r\n  the legislature intended to give credit for the time a defendant serves on house \r\n  arrest.Â  We disagree. \r\nOur supreme court has defined â€œtime served,â€ \r\n  as it is used in section 24-13-40, as â€œthe time during which a defendant is \r\n  in pre-trial confinement and charged with the offense for which he is \r\n  sentenced (so long as he is not serving time for a prior conviction).â€Â  Blakeney \r\n  v. State, 339 S.C. 86, 88, 529 S.E.2d 9, 10-11 (2000) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n  However, whether time served includes time spent under house arrest is an issue \r\n  of first impression in South Carolina.Â  Generally, penal statutes are to be \r\n  construed â€œstrictly against the State and in favor of the defendant.â€Â  Williams \r\n  v. State, 306 S.C. 89, 91, 410 S.E.2d 563, 564 (1991) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  â€œFurthermore, in construing a statute, words must be given their plain and ordinary \r\n  meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the \r\n  statuteâ€™s operation.â€Â  State v. Leopard, 349 S.C. 467, 471, 563 S.E.2d \r\n  342, 344 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, â€œâ€˜[a]ll rules of statutory construction \r\n  are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can \r\n  be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed \r\n  in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€™â€Â  Id. (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nInitially, we find it important to note \r\n  that Higgins was placed on house arrest as a condition of his release \r\n  on bond.Â  Any person charged with a noncapital offense may, in the courtâ€™s discretion, \r\n  be released pending trial.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-10 (2003).Â  The court may \r\n  impose certain â€œconditions of release,â€ including, but not limited to, requiring \r\n  an appearance bond, placing the person in the custody of another, or other conditions \r\n  reasonably necessary to assure appearance as required.Â Â  Id.Â Â  Because \r\n  Higgins was on house arrest as a condition of his release, we believe it would \r\n  be illogical to credit him for the time he served while he was â€œreleasedâ€ on \r\n  bond.Â  \r\nFurthermore, section 24-13-40 consistently \r\n  uses the language â€œtime served by a prisoner.â€Â  A prisoner is defined as â€œ[a] \r\n  person who is serving time in prison.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1213 (7th ed. \r\n  1999). [2] Â Â  Further, a prison is defined as â€œ[a] state \r\n  or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Our statutes have also used the term prisoner to refer to persons confined in \r\n  a county jail.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-10 et \r\n  seq. (1989 &amp; Supp. 2002); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-5-10 et seq. \r\n  (1989 &amp; Supp. 2002).Â  Based on the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \r\n  prisoner, we believe the legislature only intended to award sentencing credit \r\n  to those who actually spend time confined in a penal institution.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the trial court did not err in concluding Higgins was not entitled to \r\n  credit for time served on house arrest while released on bond.Â  \r\nThis view is in accord with that taken \r\n  by other jurisdictions interpreting similar statutes.Â  See State v. \r\n  Jarman, 535 S.E.2d 875, 880 (N.C. Ct. App. 2000) (holding that â€œconfinementâ€ \r\n  as contemplated by a similar statute did not include time spent before trial \r\n  on house arrest or electronic surveillance); Licata v. State, 788 So.2d \r\n  1063, 1064 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2001) (finding house arrest is not the equivalent \r\n  of incarceration in the â€œcounty jailâ€ as required by the Florida statute); People \r\n  v. Ramos, 561 N.E.2d 643, 648 (Ill. 1990) (holding the Illinois legislature \r\n  did not intend the term â€œcustodyâ€ to apply to the period of time the defendant \r\n  was released on bail for pretrial home confinement).Â  But cf. Commonwealth \r\n  v. Chiappini, 782 A.2d 490, 497, 501 (Pa. 2001) (stating house arrest could \r\n  be the equivalent of time spent in an institution when the program was run by \r\n  the local prison system, and participants were considered inmates who were required \r\n  to wear electronic devices and submit to constant monitoring). \r\nBecause we find our legislature only \r\n  intended to allow credit for time served in a penal institution, we find no \r\n  error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to afford credit to Higgins for the time \r\n  he served on house arrest while he was released on bond.Â  Accordingly, the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  North Carolina v.

Pope, III, of Newberry, for Appellants.\r\nJames L. Bruner, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBeatty, J.: Â Newberry Electric Cooperative \r\n  (NEC) appeals from the trial courtâ€™s finding that Billye West, his children, \r\n  and their family corporation (collectively, the Wests) were entitled to declaratory \r\n  relief and ordering NEC to relocate a power line on the Westsâ€™ property.Â  We \r\n  affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nW.E. and Edith Matthews owned a 98-acre tract \r\n  of land in Newberry County.Â  In June 1955, they entered into a written agreement \r\n  with NEC concerning the construction, operation, and maintenance of a power \r\n  line on their property. The easement contained several restrictive covenants, \r\n  including, NEC would not place more than four poles on the property, each pole \r\n  was to be at least 45 feet tall, and the wires at least 35 feet from the ground \r\n  â€œat the lowest point of sag.â€ The easement also stated \r\n\r\nshould the premises over which these lines \r\n  pass be developed by cutting into streets or lots or otherwise, then and \r\n  in that event, with a reasonable time after notice and upon same conditions, \r\n  [NEC] does hereby agree to remove its lines along a location along said street \r\n  or streets or elsewhere to be designated by [the Matthews] but at no time \r\n  shall [NEC] be deprived of the privilege of crossing said property at the general \r\n  proximity of the same location and in case said line is moved, [NEC] shall have \r\n  a right to use approved methods of construction in re-locating said line.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe easement concludes with a habendum clause \r\n  which states â€œTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the privileges herein granted unto [NEC], \r\n  its successors and assigns forever.â€ The document was never recorded, but rather \r\n  was maintained on file at NEC.Â  In 1989, NEC placed additional poles on the \r\n  property, in essence violating the covenant, but the Matthews did not complain. \r\n\r\nThe Wests purchased the property \r\n  from the Matthews estate in 1996.Â  While unaware of the unrecorded 1955 easement, \r\n  the Wests were aware of the NEC power line on the property. Indeed, Billy West \r\n  spoke with Larry Longshore, the CEO of NEC, before acquiring the property. West \r\n  wanted to know whether the line could be relocated.Â  West testified Longshore \r\n  assured him the line would be moved. Longshore admitted to only speaking with \r\n  West about a possible relocation and maintained that he made no firm commitment \r\n  to moving the line. However, both an NEC employee and a consulting engineer \r\n  testified that Longshore indicated a desire to move the line and asked that \r\n  plans be drawn up for relocation.Â  \r\nIn 1999, the Wests decided to \r\n  develop the property for commercial use, prompting the need for water and sewer \r\n  service.Â  The City of Newberry (the City) could provide these utilities, but \r\n  only if the Wests agreed to (1) annex the property into the City limits and \r\n  (2) receive electric service from the City instead of NEC. The Wests agreed \r\n  and the City annexed the property in January 2000. After the annexation, the \r\n  Wests asked NEC to relocate the line, and NEC refused.Â  The Wests then learned \r\n  about the 1955 easement. They reiterated their request to move the line â€“ this \r\n  time arguing that NEC had violated the covenants of the 1955 easement. NEC again \r\n  refused to relocate the line.Â  \r\nThe Wests filed a complaint seeking the relocation \r\n  of the power line, claiming trespass and promissory estoppel.Â  They also sought \r\n  a declaration that the 1955 easement was a real covenant that touched and concerned \r\n  the subject property. The trial court found for the Wests on all three issues \r\n  and ordered NEC to move the line. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in concluding that the 1955 easement on the property \r\n  was a real covenant?Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in finding that the Wests had not waived their rights \r\n  to complain to NEC under the 1955 easement?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the trial court err in finding that the Wests had met their burden of proving \r\n  promissory estoppel?\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding that NEC had trespassed \r\n  upon the property?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal \r\n  nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts \r\n  v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  â€œThe \r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law \r\n  action and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by a judge \r\n  without a jury.â€Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 533, \r\n  535 (1998). The doctrine of promissory estoppel is equitable in nature.Â  See \r\n  28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver Â§Â§ 1, 55 (2000). â€œWhen legal and equitable \r\n  actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or \r\n  equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.â€ Kiriakides \r\n  v. Atlas Food Systems &amp; Services, Inc., 338 S.C. 572, 580, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  371, 375 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted). In an action at equity, this court \r\n  can find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995).Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  1955 EasementÂ  \r\nNEC argues the trial judge erred in finding the \r\n  1955 easement was a real covenant that ran with the land. We disagree.\r\nâ€œA restrictive covenant runs with the land, and \r\n  is thus enforceable by a successor-in-interest, if the covenanting parties intended \r\n  that the covenant run with the land, and the covenant touches and concerns the \r\n  land.â€Â  Marathon Fin. Co. v. HHC Liquidation Corp., 325 S.C. 589, 604, \r\n  483 S.E.2d 757, 765 (Ct. App. 1997) (citations omitted).Â  â€œ[A] party seeking \r\n  to enforce a covenant must show the covenant applies to the property either \r\n  by its express language or by a plain and unmistakable implication.â€Â  Charping \r\n  v. J.P. Scurry &amp; Co., Inc., 296 S.C. 312, 314, 372 S.E.2d 120, 121 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1988) (citations omitted). \r\nThe very language of the 1955 easement reveals \r\n  it to be a restrictive covenant that runs with the land. In the agreement, NEC \r\n  promises to relocate the power line should the property ever â€œbe developed.â€ \r\n  That agreement applies to the land.Â  While the agreement does not specify whether \r\n  this promise was to be honored only with respect to the Matthews, it does envision \r\n  the future of the land and thus applies to the Wests. See Marathon, \r\n  325 S.C. at 604, 483 S.E.2d at 765 (explaining that a â€œrestrictive covenant \r\n  runs with the land, and is thus enforceable by a successor-in-interest, if the \r\n  covenanting parties intended that the covenant run with the land, and the covenant \r\n  touches and concerns the landâ€) (citation omitted).\r\nMoreover, the restrictive covenants in the 1955 easement \r\n  touch and concern the subject property.Â  The Matthews insisted upon several \r\n  conditions in order to maintain the safety and value of the property. The subject \r\n  of the covenants is a power line connected to and crossing over the land. Adherence \r\n  to the covenants by NEC directly affects the nature and value of the easement \r\n  to both NEC and the Wests.Â  The covenants in the easement also restrict the \r\n  manner in which NEC can use the easement. The exact location of the easement \r\n  on the property is not described in the easement, but its possible relocation \r\n  is contemplated. The covenants were obviously intended to touch and concern \r\n  the subject property.Â  See id.Â  While the language of the easement \r\n  does not expressly state the covenants were intended to touch and concern the \r\n  subject property, that is clearly implied.Â  See Charping, 296 \r\n  S.C. at 314, 372 S.E.2d at 121.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial judge did not err in holding \r\n  the 1955 easement was a real covenant that ran with the land.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Waiver\r\nNEC argues the trial judge erred in failing to apply \r\n  the doctrine of waiver.Â  Specifically, NEC argues that, as neither the Matthews \r\n  nor the Wests ever enforced several covenants in the 1955 easement, the right \r\n  to file a complaint to NEC under the easement was waived.\r\nThis issue was neither addressed by the trial judge \r\n  in the final order nor mentioned in the subsequent Rule 59(e), SCACR, motion.Â  \r\n  As such, it is not preserved for review by this court.Â  See Wilder \r\n  Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic \r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been \r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); \r\n  see also Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  122, 124 (1991) (finding issue was not preserved where the trial judge did not \r\n  explicitly rule on the appellantâ€™s argument and the appellant did not raise \r\n  the issue in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment).Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Promissory EstoppelÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSince we have found that the 1955 easement is valid as to the Wests, \r\n  we need not address the issue of promissory estoppel.\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Trespass\r\nNEC argues the trial judge erred in finding NEC \r\n  had committed a trespass upon the property.\r\nâ€œTrespass is any intentional invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  interest in the exclusive possession of his property.â€Â  Hedgepath v. American \r\n  Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 357, 559 S.E.2d 327, 337 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (citing Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 \r\n  S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001)); see also Ravan v. Greenville County, \r\n  315 S.C. 447, 463, 434 S.E.2d 296, 306 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œa trespass is any interference \r\n  with oneâ€™s right to the exclusive peaceable possession of his property.â€). \r\nIn the final order, the trial judge found, â€œthe \r\n  facts demonstrate that the NEC has violated the covenants in several ways, has \r\n  technically forfeited its rights by reason of its violation and has committed \r\n  trespass on the Property.â€Â  This is the only mention of trespass in the final \r\n  order.Â  Assuming, without deciding, that the trial judge erred in finding NEC \r\n  guilty of trespass without conducting a more thorough analysis, we conclude \r\n  this was harmless error.Â  The record supports both the trial judgeâ€™s substantive \r\n  findings and his ultimate conclusion that NEC violated the terms of the 1955 \r\n  easement.Â  See, e.g., Brown v. Allstate Ins. Co., 344 S.C. \r\n  21, 25, 542 S.E.2d 723, 725 (2001) (reinstating a trial courtâ€™s decision though \r\n  the trial court had erred since the error was harmless); 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate \r\n  Review Â§ 711 (1995) (â€œHarmless error provisions are designed to eliminate \r\n  reversals on purely formal and technical grounds, and to assure that substantial \r\n  justice has been done.â€).\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3738","title":"Rumpf v.

(â€œRTLâ€).Â  RTL was a family-owned business with three shareholders: \r\n  siblings Marvin G. Rumpf, Robert E. Rumpf, and Alice Rumpf Easton.Â  Marvin Rumpf \r\n  served as president of the company.\r\nIn 1966, RTL and Mass Mutual entered into a contract containing a pension plan \r\n  for the non-union employees of RTL.Â  The contract gave retirement benefits to \r\n  RTL employees in the form of annuities having defined benefit schedules.Â  Marvin \r\n  Rumpf served as the pension plan administrator.\r\nIn 1975, RTL merged with Duff Truck Line, Inc.Â  Duff decided to discontinue \r\n  the pension plan.Â  The contract with Mass Mutual was amended so that all of \r\n  the RTL employees who had participated in the pension planâ€”including Marvin \r\n  Rumpfâ€”were given paid-up annuities in the value of their pension plan balances.\r\nIt was anticipated, however, that the investment returns Mass Mutual received \r\n  under the contract would sometimes exceed the amount needed to pay the benefits \r\n  under the individual annuity contracts.Â  When those circumstances arose, the \r\n  amended contract provided that any dividends declared by Mass Mutual after the \r\n  commencement of the paid-up term would be â€œpaid in cash to the Contractholder \r\n  or such person, persons, firm or corporation as the Contractholder may designate.â€\r\nOn August 7, 1979, Denise A. Wilson, with Mass Mutualâ€™s Group Pension Consulting \r\n  Department, wrote to Marvin Rumpf as plan administrator informing him that dividends \r\n  had accrued under the contract that Mass Mutual wished to pay.Â  The letter noted \r\n  that Mass Mutual did not know to whom it should send the dividendsâ€”advising \r\n  Rumpf that it could not determine whether the contractholder was RTL or Duff.Â  \r\n  Mass Mutual wrote Duff notifying it of the same information.\r\nMarvin Rumpf replied by letter, dated August 25, 1979, that all dividends should \r\n  be sent to him and that he would ensure they were distributed among the three \r\n  stockholders.Â  Duff responded to Mass Mutual claiming it was the proper contractholder.Â  \r\n  Mass Mutual replied to both Marvin Rumpf and Duff informing them of the dispute.\r\nOn September 16, 1980, Marvin Rumpf again inquired with Mass Mutual regarding \r\n  the status of the dividend payment.Â  Mass Mutual advised Marvin Rumpf and Duff \r\n  by letter dated November 3, 1980 that it could not pay dividends until the parties \r\n  determined which was the contractholder.\r\nMarvin Rumpf took no further action to claim or ascertain his entitlement to \r\n  any dividends.Â  He died in South Carolina in 1989, survived by his four children \r\n  who were the beneficiaries of his estate.\r\nAs directed in his will, Palmetto Bank was appointed personal representative \r\n  of Rumpfâ€™s estate.Â  Phillip Betette, a senior trust officer for Palmetto Bank, \r\n  carried out much of the bankâ€™s work on the estate, but was not himself named \r\n  personal representative.Â  The estate was closed after a hearing before the probate \r\n  court.\r\nIn 1993, Duff Truck Lines dissolved.Â  Mass Mutual later escheated the accumulated \r\n  dividends for the period 1979 through 1989 to the State of South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Throughout the balance of the 1990â€™s, dividends continued to accrue under the \r\n  contract and were held by Mass Mutual.\r\nNo one inquired regarding the status or ownership of these funds until â€œlate \r\n  April, 1999.â€Â  That year, one of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s surviving daughters discovered \r\n  the escheated dividend payments â€œwhile browsing the Internet.â€Â  The surviving \r\n  shareholders and other beneficiaries of Marvin Rumpf confronted Palmetto Bank \r\n  and Mass Mutual as to why they had not been informed of the accumulated dividends \r\n  at the time of the distribution of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s estate a decade earlier.\r\nUpon demand from the beneficiaries, Mass Mutual, on October 6, 1999, paid them \r\n  accumulated dividends, in the amount of $169,873.45, for the period 1990 through \r\n  1999.Â  The shareholders and heirs obtained the escheated funds from the State \r\n  in the sum of $186,394.04 by check dated December 13, 1999.Â  Accordingly, all \r\n  dividends under the contract have been paid.\r\nThis Action\r\nThough all of the accrued dividends were ultimately paid, the beneficiaries \r\n  believed Mass Mutual and Palmetto Bank acted wrongfully by failing to discover \r\n  or actively concealing their entitlement to the dividend funds.Â  Thus, they \r\n  brought the present action.Â  Against Mass Mutual, they asserted multiple claims \r\n  for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, insurance bad-faith, \r\n  conversion, and unfair trade practices.Â  They alleged breach of fiduciary duty \r\n  and fraud against Palmetto Bank.\r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants on all \r\n  of the causes of action.Â  Though the court addressed the merits of the individual \r\n  claims, it found the entire case against Mass Mutual was barred by the applicable \r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Likewise, in a separate order addressing the claims \r\n  against Palmetto Bank, the trial court held that action was barred because the \r\n  statute of limitations had expired.Â  The court further ruled the action was \r\n  barred because the probate court overseeing the administration of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s \r\n  estate had discharged Palmetto Bank from all liability as personal representative, \r\n  and the beneficiaries of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s estate had signed a full release in \r\n  favor of Palmetto Bank upon distribution of property from the estate.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Laurens \r\n  Emergency Med. Specialists v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 375 (2003); Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 \r\n  (2002); Regions Bank v.

Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. \r\n  Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003); Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., \r\n  353 S.C. 449, 578 S.E.2d 711 (2003); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, \r\n  499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, \r\n  355 S.C. at 108, 584 S.E.2d at 377 (stating that in reviewing summary judgment \r\n  motion, facts and circumstances must be viewed in light most favorable to non-moving \r\n  party).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Baril \r\n  v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to \r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, \r\n  N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 578 S.E.2d 329 (2003); Regions Bank, 354 S.C. \r\n  at 659, 582 S.E.2d at 438; Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 340, 559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001); Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  All ambiguities, \r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most \r\n  strongly against the moving party.Â  Schmidt v. Courtney, Op. No. 3719 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 22, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 66); Bayle \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001); see also Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., \r\n  349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002) (â€œOn appeal from an order granting \r\n  summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to \r\n  the non-moving party below.â€).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of \r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Brockbank v. \r\n  Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000); Bayle, 344 \r\n  S.C. at 120, 542 S.E.2d at 738.Â  Summary judgment should not be granted even \r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is disagreement concerning \r\n  the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary \r\n  Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000).Â  However, when plain, \r\n  palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, \r\n  summary judgment should be granted.Â  Hedgepath, 348 S.C. at 355, 559 \r\n  S.E.2d at 336; Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).\r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary judgment has the initial \r\n  burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Regions \r\n  Bank, 354 S.C. at 659, 582 S.E.2d at 438; Trivelas v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Once the \r\n  party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence \r\n  of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest \r\n  on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank, \r\n  354 S.C. at 660, 582 S.E.2d at 438.Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward \r\n  with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  SSI Med. \r\n  Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990); Peterson v. \r\n  West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of \r\n  cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, \r\n  354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 868 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Claims Against Mass Mutual\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in ruling their claims against \r\n  Mass Mutual were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the former South Carolina Code section 15-3-530, plaintiffs \r\n  alleging an action in contract or tort were required to bring suit within six \r\n  years of the time the cause of action arose.Â  In 1988, this time period was \r\n  shortened to three years for causes of action arising on or after April 5, 1988. \r\n  See Annotation, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003) (referencing 1988 \r\n  Act No. 432).\r\nIn determining when a cause of action arose under section 15-3-530, \r\n  we apply the â€œdiscovery rule.â€Â  See Santee Portland Cement Co. v. \r\n  Daniel Intâ€™l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 384 S.E.2d 693 (1989), overruled on \r\n  other grounds by Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors \r\n  Div., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995).Â  According to the discovery rule, \r\n  the statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought \r\n  to have been discovered.Â  Hedgepath v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 340, 559 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. App. 2001); Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Under this rule, \r\n  a cause of action accrues for purposes of the statute of limitations when a \r\n  plaintiff has notice that he might have a remedy for a harm.Â  Dean v. Ruscon \r\n  Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 (1996).Â  The statute runs from the date \r\n  the injured party either knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable \r\n  diligence that a cause of action arises from the wrongful conduct.Â  Hedgepath, \r\n  348 S.C. at 355-56, 559 S.E.2d at 336; Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In explaining the discovery rule, \r\n  our Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\nWe have interpreted the â€œexercise of reasonable diligenceâ€ \r\n  to mean that the injured party must act with some promptness where the facts \r\n  and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common knowledge \r\n  and experience on notice that a claim against another party might exist. Moreover, \r\n  the fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full extent of the damage \r\n  is immaterial.\r\n\r\nDean, 321 S.C. at 363-64, 468 S.E.2d at 647 (citation \r\n  and emphasis omitted); see also Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, \r\n  442 S.E.2d 169 (1994) (stating exercise of reasonable diligence means simply \r\n  that injured party must act with some promptness where facts and circumstances \r\n  of injury would put person of common knowledge and experience on notice that \r\n  some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party \r\n  might exist; statute of limitations begins to run from this point and not when \r\n  advice of counsel is sought or full-blown theory of recovery is developed); \r\n  Burgess v. American Cancer Socâ€™y, 300 S.C. 182, 386 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. \r\n  1989) (noting that statute starts to run upon discovery of such facts as would \r\n  have led to knowledge thereof if pursued with reasonable diligence).Â  Reasonable \r\n  diligence is intrinsically tied to the issue of notice.Â  Hedgepath, 348 \r\n  S.C. at 356, 559 S.E.2d at 336; Bayle, 344 S.C. at 126, 542 S.E.2d at \r\n  741.\r\nThe date on which discovery of the cause of action \r\n  should have been made is an objective, rather than a subjective, question.Â  \r\n  Hedgepath, 348 S.C. at 356, 559 S.E.2d at 336; Joubert v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 S.C. 176, 534 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In other \r\n  words, whether the particular plaintiff actually knew he had a claim is not \r\n  the test.Â  Young, 333 S.C. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416.Â  Rather, courts \r\n  must decide whether the circumstances of the case would put a person of common \r\n  knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded, \r\n  or that some claim against another party might exist.Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, we look to whether Marvin Rumpf knew \r\n  or should have known that he, along with other shareholders, were entitled to \r\n  receive the dividend payments from Mass Mutual.Â  It is undisputed that the claims \r\n  of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s four children as beneficiaries of his estate are derivative \r\n  only and rest upon the knowledge of Marvin Rumpf as to when the causes of action \r\n  arose.Â  Appellants contend the trial court erred in finding Marvin Rumpf acted \r\n  as the agent of his sibling shareholders, and that his knowledge should be imputed \r\n  to them.Â  We disagree.\r\nMarvin Rumpf was the plan administrator when the pension plan was \r\n  discontinued and the individual, fully-paid annuities were purchased.Â  All contact \r\n  with Mass Mutual was handled by Marvin Rumpf or his attorney.\r\nAppellants claim that Marvin Rumpf notified Mass Mutual that he was \r\n  not acting on behalf of the other shareholders.Â  Specifically, Appellants rely \r\n  upon a letter dated March 22, 1976, from Marvin Rumpf to Mass Mutual in which \r\n  Marvin Rumpf indicates that Mass Mutual should correspond with fellow shareholders \r\n  Robert Rumpf and Alice Easton regarding the pension.Â  Yet, at all times following \r\n  this letter, Marvin Rumpf continued to handle all pension-related affairs on \r\n  behalf of his two co-shareholders.\r\nFor example, Mass Mutual sent annuity information to Robert Rumpf \r\n  on May 21, 1976.Â  The reply to Mass Mutual, however, came from Marvin Rumpfâ€™s \r\n  attorney and contained the Plan Administratorâ€™s Certification of Sufficiency \r\n  required to close out the pension plan which was signed by Marvin Rumpf.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is no proof that anyone other than Marvin Rumpf and his attorney \r\n  were involved with the pension plan and subsequent annuity contract.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The evidence establishes that Marvin Rumpf knew or should have known \r\n  that he and his fellow shareholders were entitled to payment of the dividends \r\n  received under the annuity contract.Â  Mass Mutual wrote to Marvin Rumpf on August \r\n  7, 1979, and advised him that dividends had accrued under the contract with \r\n  Mass Mutual.Â  He was later informed by Mass Mutual on November 3, 1980, that \r\n  there was a dispute regarding who should receive the dividendsâ€”RTL or Duff Truck \r\n  Lines.Â  At that time, Mass Mutual explicitly advised Marvin Rumpf that:\r\nWe have taken this matter up with our law department and \r\n  it is our position that Massachusetts Mutual is not the party to determine to \r\n  whom the dividend is to be paid.Â  May we ask that you contact Mr. Keenan of \r\n  Duff Truck Line, Inc. and resolve this matter.\r\nWe find that any cause of action against Mass Mutual accrued no later than \r\n  1980.Â  Instead of pursuing his claim to the dividend payments, Marvin Rumpf \r\n  permitted the then-existing six year statute of limitations to lapse.Â  Concomitantly, \r\n  we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the entire action against Mass Mutual \r\n  is barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Claims Against Palmetto Bank\r\nA.Â  Applicable Statute of Limitations\r\nWe do not reach the merits of Appellantsâ€™ claims against Palmetto \r\n  Bank because their action is barred by the statute of limitations.Â  As with \r\n  the claims against Mass Mutual, the action against Palmetto Bank rests on the \r\n  fact that Palmetto Bank failed to secure ownership of the disputed funds for \r\n  the estate of Marvin Rumpf.Â  At the time of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s death, his right \r\n  to bring suit to obtain the dividend funds from Mass Mutual had already expired.Â  \r\n  Consequently, Appellantsâ€™ derivative claims through the Estate are barred by \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530.\r\nB.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1001\r\nFurthermore, Appellantsâ€™ claims are barred because the probate court \r\n  overseeing the administration of Marvin Rumpfâ€™s estate discharged the personal \r\n  representative from any liability for the estate.Â  South Carolina Code section \r\n  62-3-1001 reads:\r\n\r\n[T]he court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate \r\n  conditions, determining testacy, determining the persons entitled to distribution \r\n  of the estate, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing \r\n  or approving distribution of the estate, terminating the appointment of the \r\n  personal representative, and discharging the personal representative from \r\n  further claim or demand of any interested person.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1001 (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).\r\nPalmetto Bank petitioned the probate court for an order of discharge.Â  \r\n  Notice of the petition was served on all of the parties, and a hearing was held \r\n  in November 1990.Â  None of the Appellants appeared at the hearing.Â  After the \r\n  hearing, Probate Judge Ralph Drake signed a form discharge order.Â  Judge Drake, \r\n  however, did not check any of the boxes on the preprinted form order indicating \r\n  the action the court intended to take.\r\nIn order to clear up the ambiguity surrounding the effect of the \r\n  probate courtâ€™s order, Palmetto Bank submitted an affidavit of Judge Drake as \r\n  evidence of his intent in signing the order.Â  In the affidavit, Judge Drake \r\n  declared that his failure to check any of the boxes on the form was an oversight.Â  \r\n  He further stated that his intention was to check Box 3 on the form, which provides: \r\n  â€œ[T]he Personal Representative is released and discharged as the Personal Representative, \r\n  and any and all liability arising in connection with the performance of the \r\n  Representativeâ€™s duties and the administration of the estate be closed.â€\r\n We first note that Appellants failed to appeal the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  findings with regard to the probate courtâ€™s discharge of liability.Â  Any unappealed \r\n  portion of the trial courtâ€™s judgment is the law of the case, and must therefore \r\n  be affirmed.Â  See Greenville County v. Kenwood Enters., Inc., \r\n  353 S.C. 157, 577 S.E.2d 428 (2003); Douglass v. Boyce, 344 S.C. 5, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 715 (2001); National Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Firemenâ€™s Ins.

Harpootlian, both of \r\n  Columbia; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  Nicholas and Peggy \r\n  Trivelas brought this action against the South Carolina Department of Transportation \r\n  (â€œDOTâ€) for damages arising from an automobile collision involving a DOT truck.Â  \r\n  The case was tried before a jury, resulting in a verdict for DOT.Â  DOT appeals \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a new trial absolute to the Trivelases, arguing \r\n  the circuit court erred because:Â  1) as a matter of law, Trivelas was more than \r\n  fifty percent negligent, and thus, the Trivelases should be barred from recovery \r\n  by the doctrine of comparative negligence; 2) the court applied the incorrect \r\n  legal standard for granting a new trial absolute based on the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine; and 3) it failed to consider explanatory and excusatory circumstances \r\n  while sitting as the thirteenth juror.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nA truck hauling lumber in an easterly \r\n  direction on Interstate 20 spilled its load in the roadway, blocking the eastbound \r\n  lanes of traffic.Â  In response to a request from police, DOT dispatched a dump \r\n  truck pulling a trailer and backhoe to assist with the cleanup.Â  \r\nThe dump truck approached the spill from the inside, \r\n  westbound lane of traffic and attempted to cross the median at the location \r\n  of the spill.Â  In order to do so, the dump truck slowed to approximately ten \r\n  miles per hour.Â  The dump truck did not have emergency signals or lights and \r\n  did not cross the median in an area designated for turning.Â  \r\nAt the same time, Nicholas Trivelas drove \r\n  his van in the westbound lane of Interstate 20, and when DOTâ€™s dump truck slowed \r\n  to turn, Trivelasâ€™ car collided with the dump truck and trailer.Â  Trivelas sustained \r\n  severe personal injuries, as well as property damage.Â  \r\nThereafter, Nicholas Trivelas sued DOT \r\n  for negligence, and Peggy Trivelas sued DOT for loss of consortium.Â  Prior to \r\n  trial, the Trivelases moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of negligence, \r\n  asserting that under any view of the facts, DOT was negligent as a matter of \r\n  law pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated sections 56-5-1560(a) (Supp. 2002) \r\n  [1]  and 56-5-1920 (1991). [2] Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted the Trivelasesâ€™ motion \r\n  for partial summary judgment, holding by any view of the evidence, DOT was negligent \r\n  as a matter of law. \r\nOn appeal, this Court reversed and remanded, \r\n  [3]  ruling that in a light most favorable to DOT, evidence existed within \r\n  the record by which the jury could find DOT was acting under explanatory or \r\n  excusatory circumstances, and thus, a violation of the statutes was not negligence \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  \r\nOn remand, the case was tried to a jury.Â  At the \r\n  close of the trial, DOT moved for a directed verdict, arguing under any view \r\n  of the evidence, Nicholas Trivelasâ€™ negligence was greater than DOTâ€™s negligence, \r\n  and thus, the Trivelasesâ€™ claims were barred by the doctrine of comparative \r\n  negligence.Â  The circuit court denied the motion.Â  \r\nDOT then requested the circuit court charge the \r\n  jury that explanatory and excusatory circumstances could justify operating the \r\n  DOT truck in derogation of the aforementioned statutes.Â  The circuit court declined, \r\n  ruling explanatory or excusatory circumstances did not apply to the facts of \r\n  the case.Â  \r\nSubsequently, the jury returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of DOT, and the Trivelases moved for a new trial absolute, arguing the evidence \r\n  presented did not sustain the jury verdict. The circuit court agreed and granted \r\n  the motion pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  DOT appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Comparative \r\n  Negligence\r\nDOT argues the circuit court erred by granting \r\n  a new trial absolute pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine because, as asserted \r\n  in its motion for directed verdict, a reasonable jury could not find Trivelas \r\n  was less than fifty-one percent negligent.Â  Thus, DOT contends the Trivelasesâ€™ \r\n  claims were barred by the doctrine of comparative negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the comparative negligence doctrine, a plaintiff \r\n  may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater than that of the \r\n  defendant.Â  Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002); \r\n  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 422, 529 S.E.2d 710, 712-13 (2000).Â  \r\n  Generally, â€œunder a â€˜less than or equal toâ€™ comparative negligence rule, determination \r\n  of respective degrees of negligence attributable to the plaintiff and the defendant \r\n  presents a question of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences \r\n  may be drawn.â€Â  Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 559, 481 S.E.2d 444, 451 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997); see also Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife \r\n  and Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 32, 491 S.E.2d 571, 575 (1997) (holding \r\n  comparison of a plaintiffâ€™s negligence with that of the defendant is a question \r\n  of fact for the jury to decide). \r\nâ€œIn a comparative negligence case, the trial court \r\n  should only determine judgment as a matter of law if the sole reasonable inference \r\n  which may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded \r\n  fifty percent.â€Â  Bloom, 339 S.C. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 713.\r\nIn a light most favorable to the Trivelases, the \r\n  evidence within the record indicates Trivelas was traveling westbound on Interstate \r\n  20, during rush hour, at approximately sixty-five miles per hour.Â  There is \r\n  no indication Trivelas was speeding.Â  Rather, the evidence indicates Trivelas \r\n  was within the flow of traffic traveling at the posted speed limit.\r\nAccording to Trivelas, he noticed a brown van immediately \r\n  in front of his vehicle.Â  The van appeared to be a van he once owned, and for \r\n  several seconds, Trivelas attempted to determine if the van was his old van.Â  \r\n  Trivelas determined it was not his old van.Â  \r\nThereafter, the van abruptly switched from the \r\n  left lane to the right lane, and, for the first time having an unobstructed \r\n  view of the road in front of him, Trivelas saw the DOT dump truck and trailer \r\n  attempting to cross the median of the Interstate, without emergency signals \r\n  or lights, in a non-designated area.Â  Trivelas applied his brakes but was unable \r\n  to stop his vehicle before it collided with the dump truck and trailer.\r\nTrivelas testified he was traveling at a safe distance \r\n  from the van at all times, and he could not see past the van until the van moved \r\n  from the left to the right lane.Â  Additionally both Trivelas and an accident \r\n  reconstructionist testified Trivelas could not have done anything to avoid the \r\n  accident.Â  A human factors analyst also testified people in Trivelasâ€™ situation \r\n  would not have sufficient time to react and avoid the accident.Â  However, if \r\n  the dump truck had been using emergency signals or lights, Trivelas would have \r\n  had more time to analyze the situation and perhaps avoid the accident.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the record in a light most \r\n  favorable to Trivelas, we do not believe the sole reasonable inference was that \r\n  Trivelas was more than fifty percent negligent.Â  See Bloom, 339 \r\n  S.C. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 713 (â€œIn a comparative negligence case, the trial \r\n  court should only determine judgment as a matter of law if the sole reasonable \r\n  inference which may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence \r\n  exceeded fifty percent.â€).Â  Rather, the jury could reasonably have found the \r\n  accident was predominantly caused by the actions of DOTâ€™s dump truck driver. \r\n  Thus, we hold the evidence was conflicting on this point, providing a legal \r\n  basis for the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a new trial absolute pursuant to the \r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Thirteenth \r\n  Juror Doctrine\r\nDOT argues the circuit court erred by granting \r\n  a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine because the circuit court \r\n  applied an incorrect legal standard.Â  We disagree.\r\n South Carolinaâ€™s thirteenth juror doctrine allows \r\n  the circuit court judge to grant a new trial absolute when the judge finds the \r\n  evidence does not justify the verdict.Â  Norton v. Norfold S. Ry. Co., \r\n  350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854 (2002).\r\nDuring the hearing on the motion for a new trial \r\n  absolute, the circuit court stated, \r\n\r\nAS CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL WROTE IN THE BAILEY V. PEACOCK CASE, \r\n  WHICH WAS TRIED HERE IN AIKEN COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT, AND I QUOTE, â€˜THE THIRTEENTH \r\n  JUROR DOCTRINE IS A VEHICLE BY WHICH THE TRIAL COURT MAY GRANT A NEW TRIAL ABSOLUTE \r\n  WHEN HE FINDS THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE VERDICT,â€™ AND THEY CITE FOLKENS \r\n  V. HUNT.Â  THE COURT IS CONVINCED THAT THE EVIDENCE DID NOT JUSTIFY THE VERDICT \r\n  AND THE COURT DOES GRANT A NEW TRIAL ABSOLUTE IN THIS CASE.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  Furthermore, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  subsequent order states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts introduced at trial, and after due consideration \r\n  of all factual evidence and testimony offered at trial, this Court is of the \r\n  opinion that conflicting evidence was presented on the issues of liability and, \r\n  therefore, evidence existed from which the jury might reasonably have inferred \r\n  that the Plaintiffsâ€™ injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of the \r\n  Defendant.Â  THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that, based upon \r\n  the factual evidence, this Court finds that justice was not done by the juryâ€™s \r\n  verdict, and in the exercise of the discretionary powers of this Court . . . \r\n  the Plaintiffs . . . are . . . granted a new trial absolute.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  \r\nDOT contends the language in the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order indicates the circuit court granted the new trial absolute merely because \r\n  conflicting evidence existed within the record.Â  However, viewing the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order as a whole, coupled with the courtâ€™s statements during the hearing, \r\n  it is clear the circuit court granted the Trivelasesâ€™ motion for a new trial \r\n  absolute because it believed â€œTHE EVIDENCE DID NOT JUSTIFY THE VERDICT[,]â€ and \r\n  thus, â€œjustice was not done by the juryâ€™s verdict . . .â€Â  (emphasis as in original).Â  \r\n  See State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 584, 582 S.E.2d 407, 410 (2003) \r\n  (holding an appellate court must view the circuit courtâ€™s statements as a whole \r\n  to determine its reasoning); Dibble v. Sumter Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 283 \r\n  S.C. 278, 282, 322 S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œAn order should be construed \r\n  within the context of the proceeding in which it is rendered.â€); see also \r\n  Eddins v. Eddins, 304 S.C. 133, 135, 403 S.E.2d 164, 166 (Ct. App. 1991) \r\n  (holding judgments are to be construed as other instruments, and the determinative \r\n  factor is the intention of the court, considering the judgment in its entirety).Â  \r\n  This is the appropriate legal standard for granting a new trial absolute based \r\n  on the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  See Norton, 350 S.C. at 478, \r\n  567 S.E.2d at 854.Â  Thus, we hold the circuit court did not err.Â  \r\nDOT next argues the circuit court erroneously refused \r\n  to charge explanatory or excusatory circumstances, and thus, when the circuit \r\n  court granted DOTâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute pursuant to the thirteenth \r\n  juror doctrine, it based its decision on an error of law.Â  \r\nThe thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by which \r\n  the circuit court may grant a new trial absolute when it finds the evidence \r\n  does not justify the verdict.Â  Norton, 350 S.C. at 478, 567 S.E.2d at \r\n  854.Â  The effect is the same as if the jury failed to reach a verdict, and thus, \r\n  the circuit court is not required to give any reason for granting the new trial. \r\n  Â Â Â Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990).Â  Rather, \r\n  assuming evidence exists to support the circuit courtâ€™s order, the circuit court \r\n  â€œjudge . . . [, sitting as] the thirteenth juror, possess[es] the veto power \r\n  to the Nth degree . . .â€Â  Worrell v. South Carolina Power Co., 186 S.C. \r\n  306, 313-14, 195 S.E. 638, 641 (1938).Â  Therefore, a circuit courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  or denying a new trial upon the facts will not be disturbed unless its decision \r\n  is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusion reached was controlled \r\n  by an error of law.Â  South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t v. Clarkson, \r\n  267 S.C. 121, 126-27, 226 S.E.2d 696, 697 (1976).Â  \r\nThe DOTâ€™s argument presumes the circuit court premised \r\n  its decision to grant a new trial absolute on an earlier legal conclusion that \r\n  explanatory and excusatory circumstances should not be charged.Â  However, other \r\n  than the statement, â€œjustice was not done by the juryâ€™s verdict,â€ the circuit \r\n  court did not state its reasons for granting the new trial absolute.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the circuit court is not required to do so.Â  See Folkens, 300 \r\n  S.C. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267 (holding a circuit court is not required to give \r\n  any reason for granting a new trial absolute based on the thirteenth juror doctrine).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThus, we decline to speculate on the significance \r\n  of the courtâ€™s prior rulings as the underlying basis for the decision to grant \r\n  a new trial absolute.Â  Rather, where, as here, the circuit court applied the \r\n  correct legal standard for granting a new trial, and conflicting evidence exists \r\n  on the contested issues, a circuit courtâ€™s decision to sit as a thirteenth juror \r\n  and grant a new trial absolute is inviolable.Â  See Worrell, 186 \r\n  S.C. at 313-14, 195 S.E. at 641 (holding a â€œjudge . . . [, sitting as] the thirteenth \r\n  juror, possess[es] the veto power to the Nth degree . . .â€); see also \r\n  South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 267 S.C. at 126-27, 226 S.E.2d at \r\n  697 (holding an appellate court may not disturb a circuit courtâ€™s decision to \r\n  grant or deny a motion for new trial absolute based on the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine unless the decision is wholly without evidentiary support or is the \r\n  result of an error of law).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decisions of the \r\n  circuit court are \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Section 56-5-1560(a) provides:Â  â€œNo person shall drive a motor vehicle \r\n    at such a slow speed as to impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic \r\n    except when reduced speed is necessary for safe operation or in compliance \r\n    with law.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] Section 56-5-1920 provides:\r\n  \r\n  Whenever any highway has \r\n    been divided into two or more roadways by leaving an intervening space or \r\n    by a physical barrier or clearly indicated dividing section so constructed \r\n    as to impede vehicular traffic, every vehicle shall be driven only upon the \r\n    right-hand roadway unless directed or permitted to use another roadway by \r\n    official traffic-control devices or police officers.Â Â  No vehicle shall be \r\n    driven over, across or within any such dividing space, barrier or section \r\n    except through an opening in such physical barrier or dividing section or \r\n    space or at a crossover or intersection as established, unless specifically \r\n    prohibited by public authority.Â  For clarification, a left turn across a painted \r\n    median is authorized unless prohibited by an official traffic-control device.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Trivelas v.

Chandler &amp; Associates listing Tillotson as the \r\n  named insured with Commercial Casualty Insurance Company of Georgia and Capital \r\n  City Insurance Company as the insurers.Â  Allegedly, Tillotson was subsequently \r\n  injured at Builderâ€™s job site. \r\nAfter the injury, Tillotson \r\n  informed Builder that Tillotsonâ€™s employees were covered by the insurance policy, \r\n  but that he was not.Â  Tillotson sued Builder in tort.Â  Builder answered that \r\n  it was immune from a suit in tort under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  As such, Builder argued, Tillotson's sole route of recovery was through workers' \r\n  compensation. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant summary \r\n  judgment only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  CafÃ© Assocs., Ltd. v. \r\n  Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991).Â  Summary judgment \r\n  is not proper where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable \r\n  to clarify the application of the law.Â  Middleborough Horizontal Property \r\n  Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison, 320 S.C. 470, 479, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  765, 771 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  An appellate court reviews the granting of summary \r\n  judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  George v. Fabri, \r\n  345 S.C. 440, 451, 548 S.E.2d 868, 873 (2001).\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment based solely on its belief that Tillotson \r\n  was barred from bringing his action in tort because of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415? \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTillotson \r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the sole basis \r\n  ofÂ  Â§ 42-1-415.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, coverage under the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act is dependent on the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Neese \r\n  v. Michelin Tire Corp., 324 S.C. 465, 471, 478 S.E.2d 91, 94 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  Whether an employer-employee relationship exists is an initial fact to be established \r\n  prior to applying the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., \r\n  343 S.C. 102, 108, 538 S.E.2d 276, 279 (Ct. App. 2000); Dawkins v. Capitol \r\n  Constr. Co., 250 S.C. 406, 410, 158 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1967); Gray v. Club \r\n  Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 184, 528 S.E.2d 435, 441 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In \r\n  the absence of such a relationship, the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission lacks \r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 343 S.C. at 108, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  at 279; see also Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, \r\n  482 S.E.2d 49 (1997).Â  \r\nIn the absence of a statutory provision to the \r\n  contrary, an injured person who is not an employee, but an independent contractor, \r\n  is not within the scope of the compensation act.Â  McDowell v. Stilley Plywood \r\n  Co., 210 S.C. 173, 182, 41 S.E.2d 872, 876 (1947).Â  We find nothing in the \r\n  record to reflect a finding by the trial court that an employer-employee relationship \r\n  existed between Tillotson and Builder.\r\nBuilder argues that Tillotson, by submitting an \r\n  insurance certificate that listed Tillotson as an insured, subjected himself \r\n  to the jurisdiction of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act through S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-1-415(a). This section provides:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the submission \r\n  of documentation to the commission that a contractor or subcontractor has represented \r\n  himself to a higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner as having \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance at the time the contractor or subcontractor \r\n  was engaged to perform work, the higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project \r\n  owner must be relieved of any and all liability under this title except as specifically \r\n  provided in this section. In the event that employer is uninsured, regardless \r\n  of the number of employees that employer has, the higher tier subcontractor, \r\n  contractor, project owner, or his insurance carrier shall in the first instance \r\n  pay all benefits due under this title . . . Any disputes arising as a result \r\n  of claims filed under this section must be determined by the commission.\r\n\r\nA court construing a statute \r\n  must first seek to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.Â  Koenig v. \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Public Safety, 325 S.C. 400, 403, 480 S.E.2d 98, \r\n  99 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to give \r\n  words used in a statute their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle \r\n  or forced construction.Â  Id.Â  The language must be read to harmonize \r\n  its subject matter with its general purpose.Â  Id.Â  â€œIn construing statutory \r\n  language, the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of \r\n  the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given \r\n  effect, if it can be done by any reasonable construction.â€Â  Higgins v. State, \r\n  307 S.C. 446, 449, 415 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1992); see also Jackson \r\n  v. Charleston Cty. Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 181, 447 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1994) \r\n  (â€œThe true guide to statutory construction is not the phraseology of an isolated \r\n  section or provision, but the language of the statute as a whole considered \r\n  in the light of its manifest purpose.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBuilder, in advancing its argument, \r\n  concentrates on the first portion and the last sentence of Â§ 42-1-415(a).Â  Builder \r\n  argues it is not liable to Tillotson because Tillotson represented himself as \r\n  having workersâ€™ compensation insurance at the time it engaged him to work.Â  \r\n  Builder also argues the last sentence of the statute vests the adjudication \r\n  of any dispute in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, not the circuit court.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWhen read in its entirety and \r\n  in harmony with the other statutes within the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, Â§ 42-1-415(a) \r\n  is inapplicable to this case.Â  First, the statute itself makes clear its purpose \r\n  is to ensure that statutory employees are protected, although their immediate \r\n  employer may have misrepresented to a contractor that it had workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  insurance.Â  The section removes liability from the contractor except in certain \r\n  circumstances.Â  \r\nImportantly, in keeping with \r\n  the statutory employee doctrine, Â§ 42-1-415(a) requires the upstream contractor \r\n  initially pay all benefits due to the subcontractorâ€™s injured employee.Â  The \r\n  contractor may then petition to transfer responsibility of future payments to \r\n  the Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund.Â  In addition, the contractor may be reimbursed \r\n  by the Fund.Â  \r\nThe section may be viewed as \r\n  enforcing the statutory employee doctrine even when a subcontractor commits \r\n  fraud by stating it has workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  The purpose of the \r\n  section is further clarified when read in context of surrounding statutes.Â  \r\n  Each section, from Â§ 42-1-410 to 450, deals with certain aspects of the statutory \r\n  employee doctrine.Â  Section 42-1-415 is principally concerned with protecting \r\n  a subcontractorâ€™s injured employees.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Builderâ€™s reliance \r\n  on the last sentence in Â§ 42-1-415 (a) is misguided. The sentence states â€œ[a]ny \r\n  disputes arising as a result of claims filed under this section must \r\n  be determined by the commission.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-1-415 (Supp. 2002) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  Tillotson did not file a claim that can be construed as a Â§ 42-1-415 \r\n  claim. Further, absent the existence of an employer-employee relationship, Tillotson \r\n  cannot file a workersâ€™ compensation claim. \r\nAccordingly, \r\n  we reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment and remand this case \r\n  to the trial court for a determination of whether an employer-employee relationship \r\n  exists and for any further action appropriate for the disposition of this case.\r\nREVERSED \r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHOWARD, \r\n  J. and JEFFERSON, A.J. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3741","title":"Ellie v.

Young, Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3741\r\nHeard January 13, 2004 â€“ Filed February \r\n  2, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nFrancis T. Draine, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nJustin Oâ€™Toole Lucey, of Mount Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Ellie, Inc., and Ronald R. \r\n  Miccichi and Ronco of Charleston, Inc., filed competing claims of breach of \r\n  contract and sought a declaratory judgment on the status of the lease between \r\n  the parties.Â  The trial court denied all claims by Ellie and found Ellie had \r\n  breached the lease.Â  The court concluded the breach was accompanied by fraudulent \r\n  acts and awarded actual and punitive damages, \r\n  [1]  Miccichi validly terminated the lease, and Stefani was personally liable \r\n  under his Guaranty.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMiccichi owned and ran Sports, a bar in \r\n  Mount Pleasant.Â  Robert Stefani and Miccichi entered negotiations regarding \r\n  Stefani taking over the barâ€™s operations.Â  Stefani established Ellie, Inc., \r\n  for management of the bar.Â  Miccichi, on behalf of Ronco, and Stefani, acting \r\n  for Ellie, signed a Management Agreement in July 1995, in which Ellie was hired \r\n  to operate the bar.Â  The agreement outlined the basic responsibilities and compensation \r\n  to Ellie.Â  Attached to the Agreement was an Addendum dealing with equipment \r\n  rental and the installation and maintenance of video gaming machines by Miccichi.Â  \r\n  Under the Addendum, Ellie received nominal compensation for handling the daily \r\n  payouts for the machines, but did not acquire any portion of the profits.\r\nSimultaneously, Miccichi, as owner of the property, \r\n  and Ellie entered into a Lease Option Agreement.Â  Ellie was granted the option \r\n  to lease and operate Sports for five years with possibilities of renewal for \r\n  three five-year terms.Â  The agreement set forth several acts of default, the \r\n  failure to observe, keep and perform any of the duties contained within the \r\n  lease after sixty days notice.Â  Miccichi was given the power to extinguish the \r\n  lease for default with fifteen days notice.Â  Miccichi signed the lease, but \r\n  enclosed a corporate authorization by Ronco, indicating he was the president \r\n  and had authority to sign.Â  An identical Addendum to the one appended to the \r\n  Management Agreement was attached to the Lease Option Agreement.\r\nContemporaneously, Stefani executed a \r\n  Guaranty and non-compete contract.Â  He personally guaranteed the payments required \r\n  under the lease, and up to $30,000.00 in liquidated damages in the event of \r\n  Ellieâ€™s default.Â  Stefani signed the Guaranty individually and as president \r\n  of Ellie.\r\nThe parties executed a first amendment \r\n  on December 18, 1995, which expressly modified the Addendum to the Lease Option \r\n  and Management Agreements.Â  The amendment established Ellieâ€™s first shares of \r\n  revenue from video gaming.Â  Ronco would purchase a five-seat gaming machine \r\n  and the profits would be divided.Â  Ellie would maintain the machine and the \r\n  payouts.Â  The amendment also ratified the existing contracts and expressly enunciated \r\n  that the Guaranty remained in full effect. \r\nA second amendment on April 4, 1996, had \r\n  more efficacy upon the original agreements.Â  It altered the Lease Option Agreement \r\n  to allow for installment payments of the fees in the event it was exercised.Â  \r\n  Additionally, it changed some of the equipment rental provisions.Â  The parties \r\n  agreed a second video gaming machine would be purchased and the parties would \r\n  share revenues of the second machine.Â  Finally, the amendment acknowledged that \r\n  the prior agreements remained in effect.\r\nSeveral months after this amendment, Stefani exercised \r\n  the Lease Option.Â  Therefore, the Management Agreement was no longer in effect.Â  \r\n  However, there is no indication Stefani was released from the Guaranty as it \r\n  also applied to the financial responsibilities of Ellie under the Lease Option \r\n  contract.\r\nRonco and Miccichi presented a third amendment \r\n  on July 6, 1998, which provided Ellie a share of all the gaming machinesâ€™ revenues.Â  \r\n  The amendment defined net revenues, and allocated twenty percent to Ellie.Â  \r\n  Miccichi and Ronco retained ownership of the machines, but Ellie was responsible \r\n  for twenty percent of certain costs, including licenses. Additionally, Ellie \r\n  was to handle daily collection of money from the machines, insure the collections, \r\n  and report any problems to Ronco.\r\nOn September 28, 1998, the parties adjusted the \r\n  amount of gaming proceeds being paid to Ellie, as well as allowed Ronco to lease \r\n  no more than twenty percent of the building for gaming use.Â  This fourth agreement \r\n  indicated that the revenues allocated to Ellie would pass on to any sublet tenant.Â  \r\n  The agreement further established that the cost of all new machines would be \r\n  paid off before any profits are distributed. \r\nThe parties next signed off on a â€œletter . . . \r\n  for the purpose of clarifying the relationship between Ronco/Ron Micciche [sic] \r\n  and Ellie/Bob Stefani with regard to the operation of video gambling machines \r\n  . . . .â€Â  The agreement, dated December 2, 1998, allocated seventy-five percent \r\n  of the first $500,000.00 in net revenue to Ronco.Â  Once net revenue surpassed \r\n  $500,000.00, the parties divided the revenue evenly.Â  Ellie/Stefani continued \r\n  to pay twenty-five percent of the expenses, and the parties agreed to add additional \r\n  rooms onto the property for gaming.Â  The rooms would be paid for seventy-five \r\n  percent by Ronco and twenty-five percent by Ellie.Â  The agreement included a \r\n  provision, which made the terms transferable with Ronco having the right of \r\n  first refusal on any offer.Â  Finally, the contract included a provision, which \r\n  read:Â  â€œThis agreement is binding on Ellie and Ronco and replaces any previous \r\n  agreement(s) between these parties.â€\r\nThe final amendment on May 1, 1999 introduced \r\n  a new company, Maple Games, Inc., into the collection of money and sharing of \r\n  revenues.Â  Maple was owned and operated by Stefani.Â  The amendment continued \r\n  the $500,000.00 revenue threshold and split Stefaniâ€™s share between Maple and \r\n  Ellie.Â  The amendment also included a provision allowing for a higher share \r\n  of revenue for Stefani in the summer months.Â  The provision was not contained \r\n  in the previous amendment.Â  Finally, the amendment defined net revenue as total \r\n  income less total payouts and Miccichi wrote in â€œless expenses!â€ that was not \r\n  objected to by Stefani prior to Miccichi signing.\r\n The partiesâ€™ disagreements centered around \r\n  the video gaming and their sharing of revenues.Â  In October 1999, Stefani claimed \r\n  the revenues had reached the $500,000.00 level at which time the revenues were \r\n  split evenly.Â  Miccichi wanted an accounting to verify the revenue figures, \r\n  and claimed Stefani excluded expenses, which should have reduced the net revenues.Â  \r\n  After reviewing the reconciliation, Miccichi identified two â€œphantom entriesâ€ \r\n  on dates where he knew no reconciliation had been performed because he and his \r\n  daughter were out of the country on vacation.\r\nIn striving to analyze the reports, Miccichi \r\n  requested additional information to support the figures.Â  Miccichi also attempted \r\n  to retake control of the collection process.Â  He sent a locksmith to the premises \r\n  to change the locks on the machines, but Stefani refused the locksmith admittance.\r\nFurthermore, the parties disputed the meaning of \r\n  the â€œmerger clauseâ€ in the letter clarifying their relationship.Â  Miccichi sent \r\n  a letter asking Stefaniâ€™s opinion regarding the status of the lease.Â  An additional \r\n  letter was sent in which his counsel stated:Â  â€œIf [Stefani] has not vacated \r\n  the property within thirty days, we will take it as a confirmation that the \r\n  current lease document . . . is still in full force and effect . . . and that \r\n  the only modifications that have potentially occurred to the lease are purely \r\n  with regards to gaming provisions.â€Â  Stefaniâ€™s counsel responded, â€œ[T]he applicability \r\n  and effect of the clause will have to be determined on a case by case basis \r\n  if, and when, a conflict arises between two competing agreements.â€\r\nMiccichiâ€™s counsel responded by letter \r\n  indicating that it was his belief the merger clause superseded the lease, and \r\n  the tenancy was considered month to month.Â  Alternatively, he stated that to \r\n  the extent the lease was valid, he placed Stefani on notice regarding the violations \r\n  of the gaming provisions and the refusal to allow the locks of the machines \r\n  to be changed.Â  Miccichi then gave notice that the lease would be terminated. \r\n\r\nApproximately a month later, Ellie notified \r\n  Miccichi that it sought to assign the lease to another corporation.Â  Miccichi, \r\n  through his counsel, denied the requested assignment.Â  Ellie then initiated \r\n  this lawsuit.\r\nEllie proceeded to trial on four main \r\n  causes of action.Â  Ellie sought a declaratory judgment that the lease was valid \r\n  and Miccichi improperly denied its assignment of the lease.Â  It claimed damages \r\n  for breach of contract and in the alternative breach of contract with fraudulent \r\n  intent.Â  Its final cause of action alleged Miccichi interfered with a prospective \r\n  relationship.Â  Miccichi answered, denying all of Ellieâ€™s claims, and filed a \r\n  counterclaim for breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent intent and a declaratory \r\n  judgment that the lease was validly terminated and his denial of the validity \r\n  of the assignment was valid.Â  The case was referred to the master-in-equity \r\n  by consent of the parties.\r\nAt trial, Miccichi presented evidence \r\n  of five financial irregularities regarding the collection of the gaming money.Â  \r\n  He asserted there were incorrect tabulations of when the threshold level was \r\n  met, unaccounted periods where the machines were reset, errors in determining \r\n  the percentage allotted to Stefani, failure to properly include all expenses \r\n  in calculation of net revenue, and phantom entries.\r\nStefani claimed the violations of the \r\n  gaming agreements were insufficient to be considered a breach of the lease.Â  \r\n  Additionally, he maintained the parties to the lease were different, and therefore \r\n  the lease was a separate document from the gaming agreements.\r\nThe Master denied all of Ellieâ€™s\r\nclaims and found in favor of Respondents on the counterclaims.&nbsp; The Master\r\nconcluded the Lease Option agreement, the video gaming Addendum, and the numerous amendments \r\n  all formed one contract.Â  The Master ruled that the parties were all the same \r\n  even if they were referred to as different names.Â  The Master noted that some \r\n  contracts referred to the parties one way and others used different titles to \r\n  denote the same party.\r\nThe Master ruled Ellie concealed money \r\n  and violated the agreement by not reporting the errors and in trying to inflate \r\n  the revenues.Â  He found Ellie breached the provisions of the agreement and the \r\n  breach was accompanied by fraud in Stefaniâ€™s failure to report the additional \r\n  money in Ellieâ€™s possession.Â  The Master awarded Respondents $47,164.00 in gaming \r\n  revenues owed to them under the contract.Â  Respondents were awarded $60,000.00 \r\n  in double rent based upon Ellieâ€™s occupancy of the premises beyond the termination \r\n  of the lease.Â  The Master awarded $46,984 in punitive damages on the breach \r\n  of contract accompanied by fraudulent intent claim.Â  The total actual and punitive \r\n  damages award was $154,148.00.Â  Additionally, he awarded $73,319.00 in attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees under the contract.Â  The Master also found Respondents were entitled to \r\n  a verdict up to $30,000.00 against Stefani individually based on his Guaranty.\r\nFinally, the Master held the breaches \r\n  of the video gaming provisions were breaches of the Lease Agreement, and therefore \r\n  Miccichiâ€™s termination of the lease was valid and justified.Â  The Master determined \r\n  Miccichi properly denied Ellie the right to assign the lease as it had been \r\n  terminated.Â  The Master ruled in the alternative that because all of the amendments \r\n  related to the Lease contract in addition to the video gaming provisions, the \r\n  merger clause extinguished the lease.Â  Therefore, the Master concluded the tenancy \r\n  was month-to-month and the notice provided by Miccichi was sufficient to terminate \r\n  the tenancy.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the Master err in ruling the contract between \r\n  the parties in existence in 1999 when their dispute arose consisted of the Lease \r\n  Agreement, the Addendum, and all the amendments?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the Master err in finding sufficient evidence \r\n  to terminate the Lease?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the Master err in holding Stefani personally \r\n  liable for up to $30,000.00 pursuant to his personal Guaranty?\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Did the Master err in finding Ellie and Stefani concealed \r\n  income from the video gaming machines?\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in not applying the doctrines \r\n  of laches, equitable estoppel, or waiver to the issue of the breaches of the \r\n  video gaming portions of the contract?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF

App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Contract\r\nEllie and Stefani maintain the video gaming \r\n  agreements were separate and distinct from the Lease Option Agreement.Â  They \r\n  attest the parties and the subject matter of the contracts were dissimilar.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe initial contract was the Lease Option with \r\n  the Addendum.Â  The Addendum included all the video gaming provisions as well \r\n  as the partiesâ€™ responsibilities with regard to collections of money from the \r\n  machines.Â  The Addendum was specifically incorporated into the Lease Option \r\n  Agreement by paragraph seven:\r\n\r\nThe attached addendum regarding equipment, repairs, taxes, \r\n  insurance warranties and indemnity is hereby incorporated by reference as if \r\n  set forth herein. Â For an obligation which pre-existed the exercise of this \r\n  lease option, said obligations shall be deemed a pre-existing or continuing \r\n  obligation, as appropriate and not a new one.\r\n\r\nThe parties to the Lease Option were Miccichi, as \r\n  owner of the property, and Ellie, as the tenant.Â  Miccichi signed the Lease \r\n  Option as President of Ronco.Â  The parties to the Addendum were the same.\r\nThe first and second amendments to the \r\n  contract both specifically recognized the changes were being made to the Addendum \r\n  and that the Lease Option continued in full effect.Â  These amendments added \r\n  video gaming machines and split their revenues between Ellie and Ronco.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the second amendment made alterations to the payments in the event Ellie exercised \r\n  its option.Â  Clearly both of these contracts were amendments to the original \r\n  transaction and constituted a single agreement between the parties.\r\nThe July 1998 amendment does not expressly \r\n  sever the Addendum from the Lease Agreement.Â  At this time, Ellie had executed \r\n  its option and was formally leasing the premises.Â  This amendment allocated \r\n  a portion of all game revenue to Ellie, and not just revenue from the two machines \r\n  in the previous amendments.Â  It allowed Ronco to place the machines in any of \r\n  three locations within its discretion.Â  This provision alters paragraph four \r\n  of the Addendum.\r\nMoreover, this amendment specifically stated either \r\n  party could terminate it and then the parties would â€œ[return] to the agreement \r\n  in the contract between the two above parties [Ronco and Ellie].â€Â  The only \r\n  contract left to return to was the Lease with the Addendum.Â  This July 1998 \r\n  amendment changed the provisions established in the previous two amendments \r\n  as well as provisions of the Addendum.Â  As such, it is read as part of one contract \r\n  between Miccichi, Ronco, and Ellie.\r\nThe September 1998 amendment adjusted the definition \r\n  of the demised premises and altered Lease provisions if necessitated by state \r\n  gaming laws.Â  The amendment contained a provision allowing Ellie to transfer \r\n  the gaming revenues to a subtenant.Â  The parties to this amendment were Miccichi \r\n  for Ronco and Stefani for Ellie.Â  Again, this amendment is tied to the Lease \r\n  and Addendum and is not read as a separate contract.Â  \r\nThe December 2, 1998, letter was â€œfor the purpose \r\n  of clarifyingâ€ the partiesâ€™ relationship.Â  It altered video gaming provisions, \r\n  such as the amount of revenue paid, and changed Lease provisions.Â  The \r\n  parties modified the equipment rental provisions of the Addendum.Â  Finally, \r\n  the parties agreed to add rooms to the premises for gaming, and varied the monthly \r\n  rental costs accordingly.Â  The parties to the letter were listed as â€œRonco/Ron \r\n  Micciche [sic] and Ellie/Bob Stefani.â€Â  Unequivocally, the parties considered \r\n  themselves and their corporations as one for purposes of the contracts and amendments.Â  \r\n  It is impossible to hold that this is a separate contract and not an amendment \r\n  to the original Lease and Addendum.\r\nThe final amendment brought in Maple Games as another \r\n  of Stefaniâ€™s corporations.Â  While this agreement only modifies the way in which \r\n  revenue from the games was split, it specifically recognized â€œEllie, Inc. (Robert \r\n  J. Stefani, operator of SPORTS Bar and Grill) is a party to an agreement between \r\n  itself and Ronco of Charleston (Ronald Micciche [sic], owner of Ronco) . . . \r\n  .â€Â  The final amendment expressly stated that the previous agreement remained \r\n  in effect.\r\nIn South Carolina, two contracts executed at different \r\n  times relating to the same subject matter, entered into by the same parties, \r\n  are to be construed as one contract and considered as a whole.Â  CafÃ© Assocs., \r\n  Ltd. v.

241 (1981) for determining whether the breach of \r\n  a commercial lease is trivial or immaterial:\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a failure to render or to offer performance \r\n  is material, the

injured party can be adequately \r\n  compensated [by damages] for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;\r\n(c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to \r\n  offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;\r\n(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to \r\n  offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances \r\n  including any reasonable assurances;\r\n(e) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing \r\n  to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing. \r\n  \r\n\r\nKiriakides, 312 S.C. at 276, 440 S.E.2d at \r\n  366-67 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 241 (1981)).\r\nEllie and Stefani do not seem to argue \r\n  the trial court erred in finding them in breach of the video gaming provisions.Â  \r\n  Clear evidence is in the record that Ellie failed to properly report revenues \r\n  and that two phantom entries into the revenues resulted in an increase in the \r\n  total revenue.Â  Additionally, Stefani admitted he miscalculated the amount he \r\n  was entitled to by adding an additional five percent in months for which it \r\n  was not provided in the contract.\r\nThe main areas of contention center around \r\n  the alleged resets of the video gaming machines and the failure to include certain \r\n  expenses.Â  At trial, much of the time and testimony was spent detailing the \r\n  resets of the machines and the probable causes for the resets.Â  Stefani maintained \r\n  the resets were caused by mechanical failures or lightning strikes.Â  \r\nMiccichi presented an expert in the video gaming \r\n  technology, who testified the machine resets were not a consequence of lightning \r\n  strikes, but had to be the result of a deliberate reset of the machine.Â  Additionally, \r\n  he professed the printout detailing the money collected would show substantial \r\n  differences, such that anyone would have known a reset occurred.Â  The Master \r\n  had sufficient evidence to demonstrate Stefani knew or should have known of \r\n  the resets and that Stefani did nothing to prevent them or to communicate them \r\n  to Miccichi. \r\nStefani had a duty to report any of the problems \r\n  with the machines immediately to Miccichi.Â  He could not retain the money that \r\n  was collected above and beyond what he was entitled to under the agreement.Â  \r\n  Stefani knew Ellie had more money on hand due to the phantom entries, the miscalculations, \r\n  and most notably the machine resets.Â  Instead of presenting the discrepancies \r\n  to Miccichi, Ellie kept the money without Miccichiâ€™s knowledge or authorization.Â  \r\n  This was in violation of Miccichiâ€™s trust and at least one provision of their \r\n  contract.\r\nMiccichi contends there were other breaches, albeit \r\n  minor ones, of the contract that when taken in total would provide justification \r\n  for cessation of the lease.Â  Stefani failed to properly insure Sports and its \r\n  equipment as required by the Lease, list Miccichi as an insured on the policy, \r\n  and account for repair money.\r\nMiccichi testified that on several occasions he \r\n  requested Stefani provide proof of sufficient insurance.Â  He averred he was \r\n  not provided evidence and could not obtain it from the insurance agent.Â  Stefaniâ€™s \r\n  insurance agent professed that the value of the policy on Sports was only $400,000.00 \r\n  until right before the time for trial when Stefani called to change it to the \r\n  required $600,000.00. \r\nThe breaches of the gaming portions of the contract \r\n  were significant.Â  Miccichi presented evidence that Ellie knew it had excess \r\n  cash on hand and failed to report it to Miccichi.Â  This omission was a breach \r\n  of their agreement requiring monies be turned over to Miccichi and mandating \r\n  the reporting of any irregularities in the machines.Â  In addition to the gaming \r\n  violations, Miccichi provided evidence that neither Stefani nor Ellie was providing \r\n  sufficient insurance on Sports as ordered by the Lease.Â  Accordingly, we find \r\n  there was sufficient evidence to support the Masterâ€™s finding that termination \r\n  of the lease was proper.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Guaranty\r\nStefani maintains the Master erred in \r\n  finding him personally liable for $30,000.00 of the damages pursuant to his \r\n  Guaranty signed at the same time as the lease.Â  He first argues that Miccichi \r\n  and Ronco did not plead the Guaranty.Â  Additionally, he asserts the Guaranty \r\n  was no longer in existence.\r\nRonco and Miccichi brought their counterclaim \r\n  against Ellie, Maple Games, and Stefani individually.Â  While it is true the \r\n  Guaranty was not specifically listed as grounds for recovery in Respondentâ€™s \r\n  pleadings, the issue was tried by consent of the parties.Â  â€œWhen issues not \r\n  raised by the pleadings are

App. 1988) \r\n  (â€œIf neither party timely objects to evidence raising issues not pleaded, each \r\n  is deemed impliedly to consent to the trial of such issues.â€).\r\nStefani and Ellie included the Guaranty \r\n  in their complaint and introduced it at trial.Â  No objection was made regarding \r\n  the introduction of testimony or evidence supporting Respondentâ€™s right to collect \r\n  under the Guaranty.Â Â  Stefani does not assert he was not on notice of the default, \r\n  just that it was not pled.Â  Finally, Stefaniâ€™s motion to alter or amend did \r\n  not raise the issue of whether the Guaranty was properly pled.Â  As we find the \r\n  issue regarding the applicability of the Guaranty was tried by consent, we affirm \r\n  the decision of the Master requiring payment of $30,000.00 by Stefani.\r\nStefani contends the Guaranty was merged out of \r\n  existence and, therefore, Ronco and Miccichi could not collect damages.Â  In \r\n  the brief, Ellie and Stefani fail to cite any supporting authority for the position, \r\n  and all arguments made are merely conclusory statements.Â  South Carolina Appellate \r\n  Court Rules specify what is required in the arguments section for an appellantâ€™s \r\n  brief:Â  â€œThe brief shall be divided into as many parts as there are issues to \r\n  be argued.Â  At the head of each part, the particular issue to be addressed shall \r\n  be set forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations of authority.â€Â  \r\n  Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR.Â  Numerous cases have held that where an issue is not \r\n  argued within the body of the brief but is only a short conclusory statement, \r\n  it is abandoned on appeal.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v.

App. 2000).Â  We find Stefani and Ellie abandoned \r\n  the issue on appeal.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Concealment and other Findings of Fact\r\nStefani maintains the Master made several errors \r\n  in his findings of fact.Â  He asserts these errors detail a bias on the part \r\n  of the judge.Â  Finally, he contends the Master erred in concluding Stefani concealed \r\n  income from the gaming machines.Â  We find no evidence of bias on the part of \r\n  the Master and rule his finding of fact that Ellie concealed income was supported \r\n  by ample evidence.\r\nStefani first asserts the trial court erred in \r\n  finding: â€œThe Lease had been amended, modified, and/or superceded by a number \r\n  of later agreements, giving rise to a dispute as to what agreements were in \r\n  effect in 1999.â€Â  Stefani avers the Lease Option Agreement played no part in \r\n  the partiesâ€™ dispute, and the only controversy was regarding the video gaming \r\n  revenues.Â  \r\nHowever, there is ample evidence in the record \r\n  showing Miccichi, through his counsel, requested a statement from Stefani as \r\n  to what agreements were in effect and whether the merger agreement applied to \r\n  the lease.Â  Stefaniâ€™s counsel refused to issue a response regarding what agreements \r\n  were in effect, and instead answered:Â  â€œGiven the present conflict between the \r\n  parties, my client will not set forth a blanket statement of its position regarding \r\n  the merger clause.Â  Instead, the applicability and affect [sic] of the clause \r\n  will have to be determined on a case by case basis if, and when, a conflict \r\n  arises between two competing agreements.â€Â  While much of the dispute did involve \r\n  the gaming revenues, there were further questions regarding what agreements \r\n  were controlling.Â  The finding of fact challenged by Stefani plays little to \r\n  no part in the ultimate decision of the Master.Â  Regardless, there is evidence \r\n  in the record to support the finding of the Master.\r\nStefani next asseverates the Master erred in finding \r\n  he â€œundertook a course of conduct to leverage and cause Miccichi to give him \r\n  a share in the revenue.â€Â  Again, the finding of fact is not highly relevant \r\n  to the ultimate conclusion of the Master.Â  However, we rule it was supported \r\n  by evidence in the record.Â  Testimony was presented that gaming machines were \r\n  unplugged or had other problems prior to Stefani being given a share of the \r\n  machines revenues.Â  A provision in one of the agreements specifically required \r\n  the machines to stay plugged in during operating hours.Â  The above evidence \r\n  supports the Masterâ€™s finding of fact.\r\nNext, Stefani contends the trial court erred in \r\n  finding:Â  â€œHaving Ellie report its computation of money owed first served as \r\n  a check and balance system to Miccichiâ€™s numbers . . . . Stefani stopped giving \r\n  Kate his spread sheet [sic], and then stopped giving his numbers first, subtly \r\n  inducing her to give her numbers from the period Z tapes first.â€Â  Miccichi testified \r\n  that Stefani gave him the revenue reports, and then they would be reconciled \r\n  with Miccichiâ€™s reports.Â  His daughter averred that Stefani would get her report \r\n  first or would not give her a report at all during the reconciliation.Â  Finally, \r\n  the main conflict over the money reported compared to the money received originated \r\n  when Miccichi discovered entries in Stefaniâ€™s records for dates when Miccichi \r\n  and his daughter were both out of town.Â  We find there was evidence presented \r\n  to support the conclusion of the Master.\r\nFinally, Stefani argues the Master erred in ruling \r\n  he concealed money from Miccichi.Â  However, there is evidence in the record \r\n  to support the finding that money was concealed and Stefani had a duty to report \r\n  the money to Miccichi.\r\nStefani improperly recorded money on several occasions, \r\n  and because of the resets, Ellie had more money on hand than it was supposed \r\n  to collect.Â  The Master found Ellie had additional money and had a duty to disclose \r\n  that to Miccichi.Â  \r\nâ€œThe duty to disclose may be reduced to three distinct \r\n  classes: (1) where it arises from a preexisting definite fiduciary relation \r\n  between the parties; (2) where one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence \r\n  in the other with reference to the particular transaction in question, or else \r\n  from the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position \r\n  towards each other, such a trust and confidence in the particular case is necessarily \r\n  implied; (3) where the very contract or transaction itself, in its essential \r\n  nature, is intrinsically fiduciary and necessarily calls for perfect good faith \r\n  and full disclosure without regard to any particular intention of the parties.â€Â  \r\n  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 673-74, 582 S.E.2d 432, 445-46 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œParties in a fiduciary relationship must fully disclose to \r\n  each other all known information that is significant and material, and when \r\n  this duty to disclose is triggered, silence may constitute fraud.â€Â  Anthony \r\n  v. Padmar, Inc., 320 S.C. 436, 449, 465 S.E.2d 745, 752 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n  â€œNondisclosure is fraudulent when there is a duty to speak.â€Â  Ardis v. Cox, \r\n  314 S.C. 512, 517, 431 S.E.2d 267, 270 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œNon-disclosure becomes \r\n  fraudulent concealment only when it is the duty of the party having knowledge \r\n  of the facts to make them known to the other party to the transaction.â€Â  Lawson \r\n  v. Citizens S. Natl.Â  Bank of S.C., 259 S.C. 477, 481-82, 193 S.E.2d 124, \r\n  126 (1972); accord Manning v. Dial, 271 S.C. 79, 83, 245 S.E.2d \r\n  120, 122 (1978); Jacobson v. Yaschik, 249 S.C. 577, 585, 155 S.E.2d 601, \r\n  605 (1967).Â  \r\nUnder the July 1998 agreement, Ellie was responsible \r\n  for collecting the money from the machines and the agreement stated:Â  â€œIf Ellie \r\n  withholds any money taken from the machines it will be considered theft . . \r\n  . .â€Â  The concealment by Ellie of the additional money in its possession amounted \r\n  to a breach of contract and a fraudulent concealment.Â  \r\n\r\nThe courtâ€™s order states:Â  \r\nThis court finds that while there is no direct evidence \r\n  that Stefani unlawfully took the money out of the machines and caused the resets, \r\n  there is substantial circumstantial evidence that proves Ellie, either through \r\n  Stefani or one of its other agents, did so.\r\nÂ . . . .\r\nThe handling of another personâ€™s cash is intrinsically fiduciary.Â  \r\n  The operation of the contract necessarily relied in part upon Stefaniâ€™s honesty.Â  \r\n  Silence in the face of these duties constituted concealment and fraudulent activity.\r\n\r\nWe find evidence in the record to support the ruling \r\n  by the trial court that Ellie had additional money on hand.Â Â  Stefani had a \r\n  duty to report it or turn it over to Miccichi, failed to perform on that duty, \r\n  and therefore, concealed money from Miccichi.Â Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Laches, Equitable Estoppel, and Waiver\r\nFinally, Appellants maintain the trial \r\n  court erred in not holding Respondents waived their right to complain about \r\n  the additional revenues in Ellieâ€™s possession, or in the alternative, Respondents \r\n  were barred from asserting the breaches by operation of the doctrine of laches \r\n  or equitable estoppel.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, the issue may not be preserved \r\n  for review on appeal.Â  The Master did not specifically rule on any of the doctrines \r\n  in his final order.Â  The motion to alter or amend does not appear in the record, \r\n  and the transcript of the hearing does not evidence the fact that these doctrines \r\n  were specifically raised to the trial court.Â  As such, they would not be preserved \r\n  for review on appeal.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised \r\n  for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by \r\n  the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Staubes v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Larry Dean McCluney was convicted of trafficking in â€œmore \r\n  than 400 grams of cocaine.â€Â  The trial judge sentenced McCluney to twenty-five \r\n  years imprisonment and a $200,000 fine.Â  McCluney appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn February of 1999, Glenn Hadden, a drug dealer, had a conversation \r\n  with Scott Simmons â€œabout transferring a large quantity of cocaineâ€ to Simmons.Â  \r\n  Shannon Randolph, Haddenâ€™s friend to whom he sold drugs, introduced Hadden to \r\n  Simmons.Â  Hadden advised Simmons that he could sell him two or three kilograms \r\n  of cocaine.Â  The two men reached an agreement whereby Hadden would sell â€œtwo \r\n  kilos of cocaineâ€ to Simmons for $40,000.\r\nHadden contacted Lieutenant David Oglesby, with the Cherokee County \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department, and informed him of the drug deal with Simmons.Â  Hadden \r\n  agreed to work as a confidential informant in this drug transaction.Â  The police \r\n  then tape recorded Haddenâ€™s next phone call to Simmons.Â  During the phone conversation, \r\n  Simmons stated that someone from Shelby, North Carolina would be arriving in \r\n  a black Lexus with the money for the transaction.Â  At trial, Simmons testified \r\n  the person he was referring to was McCluney.\r\nHadden arranged to meet with Simmons at a secluded location.Â  Hadden was accompanied \r\n  by an undercover police officer carrying two blocks of imitation cocaine.Â  Immediately \r\n  prior to the transaction, Simmons met McCluney and another individual at Brownâ€™s \r\n  Store, a local gas station.Â  McCluney, a native of Shelby, North Carolina, was \r\n  driving a black Lexus.Â  Police arrested McCluney at Brownâ€™s Store after Simmons \r\n  and Hadden completed the drug transaction. \r\nAt trial, defense counsel cross-examined Hadden about the circumstances of \r\n  the drug transaction.Â  Specifically, counsel asked Hadden whether Shannon Randolph \r\n  â€œsaid that Simmons was looking for two kilos of cocaine.â€Â  Hadden responded: \r\n  â€œSomething to that effect.â€Â  At that point, the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\n[The State]:Â  Objection as to what that person may have \r\n  said.\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  This goes to the state of mind of this \r\n  witness, Your Honor, because heâ€™s the one that ultimately took the ball at that \r\n  point and ran with it.\r\n[The State]:Â  Iâ€™m not sure how state of mind is relative, \r\n  based on that conversation.\r\nThe Court:Â  Sustained.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, defense counsel moved for a directed \r\n  verdict arguing that, as the substance in this case was imitation cocaine, the \r\n  State failed to prove the criminal offense of trafficking cocaine.Â  Defense \r\n  counsel contended that our Supreme Court, in Murdock v. State, 311 S.C. \r\n  16, 426 S.E.2d 740 (1992), held â€œit is not illegal . . . to possess imitation \r\n  drugs with intent to distribute.â€Â  The trial judge denied the motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, finding that (1) Murdock was based on a narrow set of facts \r\n  and (2) the trafficking statute was very broadly written.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial judge err in denying McCluneyâ€™s motion \r\n  for a directed verdict?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow defense \r\n  counsel to cross-examine Simmons regarding the mandatory nature of the sentence \r\n  provided for the crime charged?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial judge err in finding Haddenâ€™s testimony \r\n  was inadmissible hearsay?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDirected \r\n  Verdict\r\nMcCluney contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a directed \r\n  verdict because, as the substance involved was imitation cocaine, the State \r\n  was unable to present evidence of trafficking in cocaine.Â  We agree.\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate \r\n  court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State \r\n  v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 562 S.E.2d 313 (2002); State v. Al-Amin, \r\n  353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. \r\n  359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of \r\n  evidence, not its weight. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 \r\n  (2002); State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 584 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 2003); \r\n  State v. McLauren, 349 S.C. 488, 563 S.E.2d 346 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If \r\n  there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was \r\n  properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d \r\n  267 (2002); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 562 S.E.2d 320 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when \r\n  the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, \r\n  352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 \r\n  S.E.2d 30 (2001); State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 580 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  \r\nAn â€œimitation controlled substanceâ€ is defined as a â€œnoncontrolled \r\n  substance which is represented to be a controlled substance and is packaged \r\n  in a manner normally used for the distribution or delivery of an illegal controlled \r\n  substance.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-110 (2002).Â  In contrast, a â€œcounterfeit \r\n  substanceâ€ is defined as:\r\n\r\na controlled substance which, or the container or labeling \r\n  of which, without authorization, bears the trademark, trade name, or other identifying \r\n  mark, imprint, number, or device, or any likeness thereof, of a manufacturer, \r\n  distributor, or dispenser other than the person who, in fact, manufactured, \r\n  distributed, or dispensed such substance and which, thereby, falsely purports \r\n  or is represented to be the product of, or to have been distributed by, such \r\n  other manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nLieutenant Oglesby testified the substance used in the \r\n  drug transaction was imitation cocaine.Â  Specifically, Oglesby stated the substance \r\n  was â€œfake cocaine.â€Â  That is, the substance was primarily â€œground upâ€ salt and \r\n  flour mixed with other substances such as caffeine, lidocaine, and benzocaine.Â  \r\n  However, McCluney was indicted under the trafficking statute, S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-370 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2003), which refers to only the trafficking of \r\n  controlled or counterfeit substances.Â  Imitation controlled substances, such \r\n  as the imitation cocaine used in the present case, are not mentioned in Â§ 44-53-370.Â  \r\n  In fact, the only indictable offense applicable to imitation cocaine would be \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-390(a)(6) (2002), the statute prohibiting the delivery \r\n  or distribution of imitation controlled substances.Â  Section 44-53-390(a)(6)(A) \r\n  provides: â€œIt is unlawful for a person knowingly or intentionally to . . . distribute \r\n  or deliver . . . an imitation controlled substance with the expressed or implied \r\n  representation that the substance is a narcotic . . . controlled substance . \r\n  . . .â€Â  Section 44-53-390(a)(6) differs from the general trafficking statute \r\n  in that the offense of distribution or delivery of imitation controlled substances \r\n  is not keyed to weight, whereas the trafficking statute is dependent upon it.Â  \r\n  Unlike the mandatory sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment for trafficking \r\n  in controlled or counterfeit substances, the maximum sentence for delivery or \r\n  distribution of imitation controlled substances is five years imprisonment and \r\n  a $10,000 fine.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-390(b) (2002).\r\nThe Supreme Court explained the difference between imitation and counterfeit \r\n  substances in Murdock v. State, 311 S.C. 16, 426 S.E.2d 740 (1992).Â  \r\n  In Murdock, the defendant was found in possession of â€œwhat was believed \r\n  to be cocaine and . . . LSD.â€Â  SLED tested the substances and determined they \r\n  were not controlled substances.Â  The defendant subsequently pled guilty to two \r\n  counts of possession of a counterfeit substance with intent to distribute.Â  \r\n  Id. at 17-18, 426 S.E.2d at 741.Â  The Court declared:\r\n\r\nThis case revolves around the confusion between â€œcounterfeitâ€ and â€œimitationâ€ \r\n  substances.Â  [Defendant] was indicted for two counts of possession with intent \r\n  to distribute a counterfeit substance.\r\nâ€œCounterfeit substanceâ€ means a controlled substance which, or the container \r\n  or labeling of which, without authorization, bears the trademark, trade name, \r\n  or other identifying mark, imprint, number, or device, or any likeness thereof, \r\n  of a manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser other than the person who in fact \r\n  manufactured, distributed, or dispenses such substance and which thereby falsely \r\n  purports or is represented to be the product of, or to have been distributed \r\n  by, such other manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-110 (1985).\r\nThe drugs found in [defendantâ€™s] possession were not counterfeit drugs.Â  They \r\n  were imitation drugs.\r\nâ€œImitation controlled substanceâ€ means a noncontrolled substance which is represented \r\n  to be a controlled substance and is packaged in a manner normally used for the \r\n  distribution or delivery of an illegal controlled substance.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-110 (1985).Â  We take this opportunity to clarify the \r\n  practical difference between counterfeit and imitation substances.Â  While there \r\n  may be exceptions, such as when these substances are legally used for legitimate \r\n  medical purposes, ordinarily there is no offense involving counterfeit \r\n  LSD or cocaine, as these drugs are typically produced illegally and, therefore, \r\n  usually do not have a trademark or label of a manufacturer.\r\n\r\nId. at 18, 426 S.E.2d at 742 (emphasis in original).Â  After noting the \r\n  differences in the statutory definitions of these substances, the Court found \r\n  the defendant had not committed a crime because â€œit is not a criminal offense \r\n  to possess imitation drugs with the intent to distribute.Â  It is illegal \r\n  only to actually distribute or deliver imitation drugs.â€Â  Id. at 18-19, \r\n  426 S.E.2d at 742 (emphasis in original).\r\nGiven the differences between sections 44-53-370 and 44-53-390, we find the \r\n  trial judge erred in denying McCluneyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict. Â Imitation \r\n  cocaine, the substance at issue in this case, is not a counterfeit substance \r\n  and does not fall under the purview of the trafficking statute.Â  This error \r\n  was compounded by the trial judgeâ€™s jury charge on trafficking.Â  The judge did \r\n  not charge the jury that the substance at issue in this case was imitation cocaine.Â  \r\n  Rather, he referred to the substance as counterfeit five times in the jury charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial of McCluneyâ€™s \r\n  motion for a directed verdict because, as McCluney was in possession of imitation \r\n  cocaine, he was improperly indicted under the trafficking statute.Â  We do NOT \r\n  reach any other issues.Â  Based on the foregoing, McCluneyâ€™s conviction and sentence \r\n  is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n GOOLSBY, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3743","title":"Kennedy v.

Clary, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3743\r\nHeard November 5, 2003 â€“ Filed February \r\n  3, 2004Â Â Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKenneth L. Holland, of Gaffney, for Appellant\r\nWilliam S. Brown, of Greenville, for\r\nRespondent(s).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n CONNOR, J.:Â  Richard Kennedy appeals \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s denial of his motion for a new trial based upon: (1) the admission \r\n  of a blood test showing marijuana was in his system at the time of his automobile \r\n  accident; and (2) the trial judgeâ€™s jury instruction regarding the per \r\n  se negligence statute.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 29, 1998, Kennedy was driving his pickup \r\n  truck on U.S. Route 29 in Cherokee County, approaching the intersection with \r\n  Secondary Road 164.Â Â  Scott Griffin was driving an eighteen-wheeler truck in \r\n  the scope of his employment with Dick Simon Trucking, Inc., on Secondary Road \r\n  164.Â Â  At the intersection, Griffin pulled out in front of Kennedy to make a \r\n  left turn onto U.S. Route 29.Â  Kennedyâ€™s truck collided with the rear set of \r\n  tires on the trailer of Griffinâ€™s truck.Â Â  The weather was clear on the day \r\n  of the accident.Â Â  \r\nMaxie Littlejohn witnessed Kennedy applying his brakes at \r\n  the last second before impact, causing Littlejohn to wonder why Kennedy did \r\n  not slow down to avoid the accident. Â Â The investigating officer found \r\n  short skid marks in Kennedyâ€™s lane, suggesting Kennedy was not paying attention \r\n  or panicked and froze before slamming on the brakes.Â Â Â  Griffin testified that \r\n  he saw Kennedyâ€™s truck and thought he had a safe distance to make the turn.Â Â  \r\n  Kennedy testified that Griffin bolted out in front of him, blocked both lanes \r\n  of traffic, and then slammed on his brakes, forcing Kennedy to apply his brakes \r\n  and swerve.Â Â Â Â  \r\nKennedy was taken to the hospital by ambulance \r\n  for treatment of his injuries.Â  As part of a routine practice when treating \r\n  victims of automobile accidents, the emergency room physician performed a blood \r\n  test on Kennedy to determine if any substances were present in his system that \r\n  would react adversely to medicines administered to him.Â Â Â  The results of the \r\n  blood test indicated the presence of marijuana in Kennedyâ€™s blood stream.Â Â  \r\n  The test results did not indicate the level of drugs in Kennedyâ€™s system or \r\n  how long the drugs had been in his system.Â Â  Nothing in the record indicates \r\n  that marijuana was found in or around Kennedyâ€™s vehicle or that Kennedy smelled \r\n  of marijuana.Â  \r\n Kennedy filed suit against Griffin and \r\n  Dick Simon Trucking, Inc., seeking to recover damages for negligence.Â  Prior \r\n  to trial, Kennedy filed a motion in limine to exclude the admission of \r\n  the blood test analysis showing the presence of marijuana in his system.Â Â Â  \r\n  The judge denied the motion.Â Â  Kennedyâ€™s treating physician later testified \r\n  before the jury that the toxicology report showed Kennedy had marijuana in his \r\n  system, but the report did not indicate the level of intoxication or how long \r\n  the marijuana had been in his system.Â Â  \r\nThe trial judge instructed the jury on \r\n  the law of negligence per se under the driving under the influence \r\n  statute.Â Â Â  The jury returned a verdict finding Kennedy was seventy percent \r\n  at fault for the accident and Griffin and Dick Simon Trucking were thirty percent \r\n  at fault.Â Â  Kennedy, thus, was unable to recover any damages.Â  He moved for \r\n  a new trial, and the trial judge immediately denied the motion.Â Â  Kennedy appeals. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nI. Did the trial judge err in allowing the admission of evidence \r\n  that Kennedy had marijuana in his system?\r\nII. Did the trial judge err in charging the jury \r\n  on the law of negligence per se?\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nThe denial of a motion for a new \r\n  trial is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 495, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 295, 300 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d, 353 S.C. 481, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  293 (2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Admission of Marijuana \r\n  Evidence\r\nKennedy argues he was entitled to a new trial due \r\n  to the admission of the toxicology test results into evidence because the probative \r\n  value of the results was substantially outweighed by undue prejudice.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œEvidence is relevant and admissible if it tends \r\n  to establish or make more or less probable some matter in issue.â€Â  Hoeffner \r\n  v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 365, 429 S.E.2d 190, 192 (1993); Rule 401, \r\n  SCRE; Rule 402, SCRE.Â  However, otherwise relevant evidence may be excluded \r\n  where its probative value is â€œsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair \r\n  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .â€Â  Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE.Â  â€œUnfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an \r\n  improper basis.â€Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 666, 552 S.E.2d 745, \r\n  760 (2001).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit or exclude evidence is within \r\n  his discretion and will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion occurs.Â  \r\n  Pike v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000).\r\nIn support of their argument that the \r\n  trial judge did not err in admitting the blood test results, Griffin and Dick \r\n  Simon Trucking cite Gulledge v. McLaughlin, 328 S.C. 504, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  816 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In Gulledge, this Court discussed the admissibility \r\n  of blood test results in a car accident case showing the deceased had a blood \r\n  alcohol content (BAC) of .166.Â  The deceasedâ€™s spouse argued the BAC test result \r\n  should not have been admitted because, standing alone, it was insufficient to \r\n  establish impairment.Â  Reviewing the deceasedâ€™s BAC level of .166, testimony \r\n  from a medical technologist that a BAC level of .4 or .5 would be inconsistent \r\n  with life, the beer cans and cooler found near the deceasedâ€™s vehicle, and the \r\n  circumstances of the accident, the Court found there was evidence sufficient \r\n  for a jury to conclude the deceased was impaired from alcohol consumption at \r\n  the time of the accident.Â  This Court held the trial judge did not abuse his \r\n  discretion in admitting the evidence.Â  Gulledge, 328 S.C. at 511-12, \r\n  492 S.E.2d at 819-20.Â  \r\nThe present case is clearly distinguishable \r\n  from Gulledge.Â  Although Kennedy tested positive for marijuana, the test \r\n  did not measure the quantity of marijuana in Kennedyâ€™s system or how recently \r\n  Kennedy had been exposed to marijuana.Â  Unlike the evidence in Gulledge, \r\n  no evidence in the present case indicated whether the marijuana was of such \r\n  a level as to impair Kennedyâ€™s judgment.Â  Further, the circumstantial evidence \r\n  did not support an inference that Kennedy was impaired due to marijuana use.Â  \r\n  No marijuana was found in or near Kennedyâ€™s truck and there was no testimony \r\n  that Kennedy smelled of marijuana.Â  Although witnesses noticed that Kennedy \r\n  delayed in applying his brakes, Kennedyâ€™s actions did not necessarily suggest \r\n  that he was driving under an impairment.Â  \r\nUnder these circumstances, evidence of the mere \r\n  presence of marijuana, without further indication of impairment, could mislead \r\n  the jury.Â  The admission of this evidence was more prejudicial than probative \r\n  because there was no correlation between the marijuana and the accident.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge erred in allowing its admission.Â  See Simco v. Ellis, \r\n  303 F.3d 929, 933-34 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that evidence of a \r\n  truck driverâ€™s cocaine use at the time of the accident should have been excluded \r\n  as prejudicial where the toxicology test did not support a finding of intoxication \r\n  and the mere mention of cocaine could inflame a jury); State v. McClain, \r\n  525 So. 2d 420 (Fla. 1988) (finding the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in excluding evidence of trace amounts of cocaine in the defendantâ€™s blood where \r\n  chemist could not express opinion on whether it would have affected defendantâ€™s \r\n  driving and it would have seriously prejudiced defendant in the eyes of the \r\n  jury); Martinez v. Graves, 2003 WL 21466962 (Tex. App. 2003) (affirming \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s exclusion of evidence of cocaine in the deceasedâ€™s system \r\n  because the amount of cocaine was not established and there was no correlation \r\n  between the cocaine and the accident). \r\nII. Negligence Per Se charge\r\nKennedy also asserts he was entitled to \r\n  a new trial because the trial judge erred in charging the law of negligence \r\n  per se to the jury.Â  \r\nIt is unlawful to drive in this State \r\n  while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930 (1991). \r\n  [2] Â  A driver is â€œunder the influenceâ€ when ingestion of drugs or alcohol \r\n  results in the impairment of the driverâ€™s faculties, impairs the driverâ€™s ability \r\n  to operate the vehicle with reasonable care, or impairs the driverâ€™s ability \r\n  to drive as a prudent driver would operate the vehicle.Â  State v. Kerr, \r\n  330 S.C. 132, 143-44, 498 S.E.2d 212, 217 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nâ€œNegligence per se is established by proof \r\n  that a party violated a statute which has the essential purpose of protecting \r\n  persons such as the injured party from the kind of harm suffered.â€Â  Gulledge, \r\n  328 S.C. at 510, 492 S.E.2d at 819 (internal citations omitted); Coleman \r\n  v. Shaw, 281 S.C. 107, 314 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding that violation \r\n  of a statute is negligence per se).Â  â€œWhere there is evidence from which \r\n  the jury can reasonably infer one is in violation of a statute, that evidence \r\n  will support a charge of that statute.â€Â  Jefferson v. Synergy Gas, Inc., \r\n  303 S.C. 479, 481, 401 S.E.2d 427, 428 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decisions \r\n  on jury instructions will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn \r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error \r\n  of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 389, 529 S.E.2d at 539 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nOver Kennedyâ€™s objection, the judge charged the \r\n  jury on negligence per se as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for any person who is a habitual user of narcotic \r\n  drugs, or any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquors, narcotic \r\n  drugs, barbiturates, paraldehydes or drugs, herbs, or any other substance of \r\n  like character, whether synthetic or natural, to drive any vehicle within this \r\n  state.\r\nI charge you that violation of any of the provisions of these \r\n  statutes is negligence as a matter of law.Â  This means that proof of such violation \r\n  is in itself proof of negligence, so that should you find such violation, your \r\n  only concern would be whether the violation caused the injury and damage.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n There was no evidence in the present case \r\n  that Kennedy was under the influence of marijuana.Â  As previously discussed, \r\n  the blood test indicated the presence of the drug but not the level of intoxication.Â  \r\n  No marijuana was found on Kennedy or in his vehicle and no evidence was presented \r\n  that Kennedy smelled of marijuana.Â  Although there was evidence that Kennedy \r\n  hesitated before braking, no evidence was presented to support an inference \r\n  that his ability to drive was impaired from the ingestion of marijuana.Â  There \r\n  was no evidence that the marijuana in Kennedyâ€™s system was of such a level as \r\n  to impair his ability to drive with reasonable care, and thus, there was no \r\n  evidence to support an inference that Kennedy was driving â€œunder the influence.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, it was error for the trial judge to \r\n  instruct the jury on the law of negligence per se where no evidence existed \r\n  showing Kennedy was driving under the influence.Â  See State v. Cooley, \r\n  342 S.C. 63, 67, 536 S.E.2d 666, 668 (2000) (holding the trial judge erred when \r\n  he issued a voluntary manslaughter charge because the record contained no evidence \r\n  supporting a finding of sufficient legal provocation).Â  Further, there is a \r\n  reasonable probability that the jury based its verdict on the erroneous charge, \r\n  in conjunction with the erroneous admission of evidence showing marijuana in \r\n  Kennedyâ€™s system.Â  As such, it is proper to grant a new trial.Â  See Taylor \r\n  v. State, 312 S.C. 179, 183, 439 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1993) (â€œ[W]e cannot say \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt the jury did not base its verdict on the erroneous \r\n  jury charge . . . Because there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed \r\n  to the verdict, we REVERSE.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge in this case erred in \r\n  allowing the admission of blood test results showing the presence of an unmeasured \r\n  amount of marijuana in Kennedyâ€™s system absent any other evidence indicating \r\n  Kennedy was under the influence or driving under an impairment.Â  Similarly, \r\n  the trial judge erred in charging the jury on negligence per se when \r\n  there was no evidence that Kennedy was driving â€œunder the influence.â€Â  The trial \r\n  judge should have granted Kennedyâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  juryâ€™s verdict is REVERSED and the matter is REMANDED for a new \r\n  trial.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs and GOOLSBY, J., dissents \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissenting:&nbsp;\r\nI disagree \r\n  with Kennedyâ€™s argument that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to \r\n  suppress the blood test.\r\nâ€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ means \r\n  evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence \r\n  to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would \r\n  be without the evidence.â€3Â  â€œAll \r\n  relevant evidence is admissible.â€4&nbsp;\r\nâ€œAlthough relevant, evidence may \r\n  be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \r\n  of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by \r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative \r\n  evidence.â€5&nbsp;\r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit or exclude evidence \r\n  is within his discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse \r\n  of discretion occurs.6&nbsp;\r\nEvidence showing the presence of drugs in Kennedyâ€™s \r\n  system at the time of the accident is highly probative of impairment.7Â  \r\n\r\nThe circumstances surrounding the \r\n  accident, as in Gulledge v. McLaughlin, \r\n  [8]  provide corroborating evidence that Kennedy may have been under the \r\n  influence of marijuana at the time of the accident and supply the basis for \r\n  the admission of the blood test results.Â  Kennedyâ€™s failure to stop quickly \r\n  enough to avoid the accident, even though the tractor-trailer was in plain view, \r\n  and the presence of marijuana in his blood system support an inference of impairment \r\n  that the jury should have been allowed to consider in determining fault. \r\nI also disagree with Kennedyâ€™s argument \r\n  that the judge erred in instructing the jury that a violation of S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-5-2930 (Supp. 2002) would constitute negligence per se.\r\nA trial judge should confine jury \r\n  instructions to the issues raised by the pleadings and supported by the evidence. \r\n  [9] Â  Here, the question of Kennedyâ€™s negligence was an issue framed by \r\n  the pleadings and there was evidence that he had marijuana in his system at \r\n  the time of the accident.  [10] Â  As our supreme court recognized \r\n  in Field v. Gregory,  [11] \r\n   a violation of an applicable statute by a motorist is negligence per \r\n  se.Â  The jury instruction concerning the statute at issue was, therefore, \r\n  proper.Â  I would affirm.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Dick Simon Trucking filed a Chapter 11 Petition on February 25, \r\n    2002, and an automatic stay was placed on the appeal.Â  The United States Bankruptcy \r\n    Court for the District of Utah entered an order liquidating Dick Simon Trucking.Â  \r\n    The order further allowed a lifting of the bankruptcy stay to the extent that \r\n    Kennedy seeks to recover available insurance coverage.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â This version of section 56-5-2930 was in effect at the time of the \r\n    May 29, 1998, accident.Â  Effective June 29, 1998, section 56-5-2930 was substantially \r\n    revised.Â  The new version incorporates the definition of â€œunder the influence.â€Â  \r\n    It provides that it is unlawful to drive while under the influence of alcohol \r\n    or drugs â€œto the extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially \r\n    and appreciably impaired.â€Â  S.C.

[1] Â  The issues on appeal \r\n    relate to the verdict, which Hunt challenges as inconsistent, and to the trial \r\n    judgeâ€™s failure to instruct the jury regarding the doctrine of attractive \r\n    nuisance.Â  We affirm.\r\n  FACTS \r\n  \r\n  Hunt \r\n    commenced this action against IPC for the wrongful death of Terry Henson (â€œTerryâ€).Â  \r\n    Huntâ€™s complaint alleged negligence, attractive nuisance, and unguarded dangerous \r\n    condition.Â  IPC answered, pleading affirmative defenses of comparative negligence \r\n    and sole negligence of others.\r\n  IPC \r\n    owns and operates a canal that runs twenty-seven miles through Georgetown \r\n    County.Â  The canal eventually terminates in the City of Georgetown.Â  Several \r\n    pumping stations aid the flow of the water through the canal.Â  When water \r\n    reaches the Church Street pumping station, it rushes through an underground, \r\n    forty-two-inch pipe at 19,000 gallons per minute.\r\n  Access \r\n    roads that IPC uses for maintenance run alongside the entire length of the \r\n    canal.Â  IPC employees travel these roads Monday through Friday, inspecting \r\n    the canal.Â  With the exception of some small areas near two schools, the canal \r\n    is not fenced.Â  â€œNO TRESPASSINGâ€ signs, which IPC erected when it constructed \r\n    the canal, have disappeared.Â  On Saturday, April 25, 1998, there were no signs \r\n    warning trespassers of the hazard created by the swift, flowing water.\r\n\r\n \r\n  On \r\n    that day, ten-year-old Terry and his older brother went to the home of Donnie \r\n    Lippert, a friend.Â  Another friend, Dustin, had been riding his go-cart near \r\n    the canal and wanted to show the boys something the record describes as â€œa \r\n    dirt jumping hill.â€Â  The boys walked to the canal and entered the canal property, \r\n    using a dirt path by a fence that protected the Church Street pumping station. \r\n    \r\n  The \r\n    boys eventually walked over to a pipe that spans the canal.Â  Metal bracing, \r\n    which serves as support for the pipe, gives it the appearance of a bridge.\r\n  The \r\n    boys used the pipe to cross over to the other side of the canal, where they \r\n    found a cast net.Â  Terry decided to enter the water, holding on to the cast \r\n    net while his friends held the other end.Â  After being in the water for a \r\n    short period, Terry attempted to grab the metal supports to lift himself out \r\n    of the water.Â  In the process, he slipped and fell back into the water.Â  With \r\n    his friends unable to hold on to the cast net, the swift current swept Terry \r\n    away and he drowned.\r\n  IPC \r\n    knew of at least three other people who had drowned in the canal, two of whom \r\n    were reportedly good swimmers.\r\n  The \r\n    trial judge directed a verdict in favor of IPC as to attractive nuisance and \r\n    submitted the case to the jury, using a verdict form to which no one objected. \r\n    \r\n  The \r\n    form consisted of four questions.Â  The first asked whether IPC was negligent \r\n    and whether its negligence proximately caused Terryâ€™s death.Â  The jury answered \r\n    â€œyes.â€Â  The second question asked whether Terry was negligent and whether \r\n    his negligence proximately caused his death.Â  Again, the jury answered â€œyes.â€Â  \r\n    Question three instructed the jury to allocate the percentage of negligence \r\n    attributable to each party.Â  The jury attributed 75 per cent to Terry and \r\n    25 per cent to IPC.Â  Question four asked for the total amount of damages sustained \r\n    by the plaintiff.Â  The jury found $400,000.Â  The question, however, instructed \r\n    the jury not to reduce the amount of damages by the negligence attributed \r\n    to Terry.Â  It did not do so.\r\n\r\n \r\n  When \r\n    the jury reached its verdict, the trial judge instructed the clerk to publish \r\n    the answers to the verdict form.Â  The clerk read the answers to questions \r\n    one through three.Â  Once the clerk stated the jury had allocated 75 per cent \r\n    of the negligence to Terry and 25 per cent to IPC, the trial judge instructed \r\n    the clerk not to read any further; consequently, the clerk did not publish \r\n    the juryâ€™s answer to the fourth question in the juryâ€™s presence. \r\n  After \r\n    affirming the verdict, the judge asked the parties if there was anything else \r\n    they wanted from the jury.Â  Receiving negative responses from both parties, \r\n    she dismissed the jurors.\r\n  Afterward, \r\n    the judge published the answer to the fourth question.Â  She explained she \r\n    did not publish the answer earlier because of the percentage of negligence \r\n    attributed to the child would not have entitled Hunt to a judgment against \r\n    IPC. \r\n  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    I. \r\n  \r\n  Hunt \r\n    argues the juryâ€™s verdict is inconsistent and also contends the trial judge \r\n    erred by discharging the jury before publishing the juryâ€™s answer to the fourth \r\n    question.\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n  Hunt \r\n    maintains the verdict was inconsistent because the jury, which experienced \r\n    confusion concerning certain issues it was to decide, found Terry 75 per cent \r\n    at fault, damages notwithstanding.\r\n  While \r\n    it is true the record reflects the jury raised several questions with the \r\n    trial judge during its deliberations and twice returned to the courtroom for \r\n    further instructions, the trial judge responded to each question without objection \r\n    from Hunt. In particular, Hunt did not object to the judgeâ€™s additional instructions \r\n    on comparative negligence. [2] \r\n  Regarding the verdict \r\n    form, the trial judge explained to the jury how it was to complete it.Â  She \r\n    told the jury:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Now, if you answered number three \r\n    [which instructed the jury to apportion fault if it found the negligence of \r\n    both parties proximately caused Terryâ€™s death] and you put a percentage, and \r\n    this is again for instructions only, if this should happen, you put a percentage \r\n    of negligence on the part of the deceased, Terry Henson, you do not lower \r\n    the amount of damages by that percentage.Â  Do not do it.Â  In other words, \r\n    even if you found negligence on the part [sic] for this question I want to \r\n    see the total amount of damages.Â  Do you understand what Iâ€™m saying?Â  Do not \r\n    reduce it by any amount of negligence you might apply.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Hunt did not \r\n    object to these instructions and, as indicated above, did not object to the \r\n    verdict form. [3] \r\n\r\n \r\n  Hunt, \r\n    however, cites cases concerning inconsistent verdicts or the failure of a \r\n    jury to follow instructions. [4] Â Â  These cases have no application \r\n    here.Â  In this instance, the jury rendered a verdict that was consistent on \r\n    its face with the structure of the form submitted to it and the jury completed \r\n    the verdict form in accordance with the trial judgeâ€™s instructions.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n  B.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n  Hunt \r\n    also argues the trial judge erred in discharging the jury before publishing \r\n    the verdict form to counsel in its entirety.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The trial judge properly determined \r\n    the jury returned a defense verdict based on the law of comparative negligence \r\n    and in accordance with her instructions; thus, there was no need to publish \r\n    the entire verdict form in the juryâ€™s presence. \r\n    [5] \r\n\r\n \r\n  II.\r\n  A.\r\n  Tragic as this case is, \r\n    the trial judge committed no error in directing a verdict in favor of IPC \r\n    on the issue of attractive nuisance.Â  Settled law supports what the trial \r\n    judge did. [6] Â  When viewed in the light most favorable to Hunt, \r\n    [7]  the evidence shows Terry was not attracted to the premises \r\n    by reason of the canal.Â  He went there for another purpose entirely, i.e., \r\n    to see â€œa dirt jumping hill.â€Â  The attractive nuisance doctrine â€œis not applicable \r\n    where the injured child went to the dangerous situation for some other reason.â€ \r\n    [8] \r\n  B.\r\n  Even if the trial judge \r\n    erred in directing a verdict as to attractive nuisance, the error is harmless.Â  \r\n    The questions of whether IPC was negligent and whether IPC maintained an â€œunguarded \r\n    conditionâ€ [9]  remained for the juryâ€™s consideration.Â  \r\n    \r\n  Regarding the question \r\n    of â€œunguarded condition,â€ where, as here, the element of attractiveness is \r\n    missing and the child does not enjoy the status of an invitee or business \r\n    visitor, a child who sustains injury by reason of a dangerous condition of \r\n    the premises may still have a right of recovery for his or her injuries under \r\n    appropriate circumstances. \r\n    [10] Â  Our supreme court has recognized that this right runs â€œ[p]arallel \r\n    with the attractive nuisance doctrine.â€ \r\n    [11] Â Â  We therefore fail to see how the trial judgeâ€™s directing \r\n    a verdict on the question of attractive nuisance prejudiced Hunt, being that \r\n    the trial judge did not direct a verdict on the question of unguarded condition. [12] Â Â Then too, the negligence cause \r\n    of action subsumed both unguarded condition and attractive nuisance. \r\n    [13] Â  \r\n  We recognize the verdict \r\n    form did not ask the jury to determine the unguarded condition claim separately \r\n    from the negligence claim; however and as noted above, counsel for both parties \r\n    examined the form after the trial judge submitted it to the jury and neither \r\n    side voiced any objection to the form. [14]  \r\n  C.\r\n\r\nWe also \r\n  have serious reservations regarding whether this court can consider the issue \r\n  regarding attractive nuisance. [15] \r\n \r\n  Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR \r\n    requires an appellantâ€™s initial brief to contain â€œ[a] statement of each of \r\n    the issues presented for review.â€Â  The rule further states that, â€œ[o]rdinarily, \r\n    no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the \r\n    issues on appeal.â€Â  Chief Justice Toal and her co-authors write in their work \r\n    Appellate Practice in South Carolina that â€œwhere an issue is not specifically \r\n    set out in the statement of issues, the appellate court may nevertheless consider \r\n    the issue if it is reasonably clear from appellantâ€™s arguments.â€ [16] Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  For the latter proposition, the \r\n    authors cite Southern Welding Works, Inc. v. K &amp; S Construction Co., \r\n    [17]  a case decided under the prior Rules of the Supreme Court \r\n    in which Rule 4, Section 6, required an appellant to include exceptions, among \r\n    other things, in a transcript of record.Â  Each exception had to contain a \r\n    concise statement of one proposition of law or fact that the appellant asked \r\n    the supreme court to review.Â  \r\n  Judge Bell, writing for the court \r\n    of appeals in that case, noted the appellantâ€™s exceptions violated Rule 4, \r\n    Section 6, because they failed to contain a complete assignment of error.Â  \r\n    Nevertheless, the court elected to consider those issues â€œwhich [were] reasonably \r\n    clear from [appellantâ€™s] argument and which were ruled on by the trial court.â€ \r\n    \r\n  What we gleaned from Judge Bellâ€™s \r\n    opinion is that the exceptions, questions, and issues presented for appellate \r\n    review in that case, namely, whether the appellant had been denied its statutory \r\n    right to four peremptory challenges and whether the trial court properly refused \r\n    to allow the appellant to recall a witness, were preserved for appellate review \r\n    notwithstanding the exceptions did not contain a â€œbecauseâ€ clause.Â  In other \r\n    words, although the appellant challenged two particular, identifiable rulings \r\n    made by the trial court, but failed to detail its reasons for each challenge, \r\n    the failures were not fatal to its appeal because the court could discover \r\n    the assignments of error directed to each of the two rulings from the arguments \r\n    set out in the appellantâ€™s brief.\r\n   \r\n  That is a far cry from what Hunt \r\n    did in this case.Â  Here, Hunt set forth in her initial brief the following \r\n    issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The trial court erred in failing \r\n    to charge attractive nuisance where a ten year old was attracted to the \r\n    canal in which he drowned but entered the property for a purpose unrelated \r\n    to water.\r\n\r\n \r\n  (Emphasis \r\n    added.)\r\n  The reason the trial judge \r\n    did not charge the law regarding attractive nuisance was because that \r\n    theory of recovery was no longer an issue in the case. [18] Â  The trial judge had earlier directed \r\n    a verdict on that issue in IPCâ€™s favor pursuant to its motion.\r\n  Nowhere in the issues \r\n    on appeal does Hunt ask this court to review the granting by the trial judge \r\n    of IPCâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  Rather, Hunt, under an issue relating \r\n    to jury instructions, bootstraps an attack on the trial judgeâ€™s action \r\n    in directing a verdict by arguing the trial judge erred in refusing \r\n    to charge attractive nuisance as a basis for recovery.\r\n  An issue directed at a \r\n    trial courtâ€™s denial of a request to charge does not reasonably and fairly \r\n    embrace a trial courtâ€™s granting of a directed verdict. [19] Â  If a party wishes to question \r\n    a trial courtâ€™s directing of a verdict in an opposing partyâ€™s favor, the party \r\n    should appeal that particular ruling.Â  A challenge to a failure to charge \r\n    is a poor vehicle by which to challenge the grant of a directed verdict motion. [20] Â  Appellate review \r\n    of the grant of a motion for a directed verdict and of a denial or granting \r\n    of a request to charge involve different considerations. [21] \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concurs.Â  \r\n    ANDERSON, J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J. (concurring in part \r\n  and dissenting in part):Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority \r\n  in regard to the following issues: \r\n\r\n  1.Â  Inconsistent Verdict; and\r\n    2. Discharge of the Jury \r\n    Before Publishing the Verdict Form to Counsel in its Entirety.\r\n\r\nI disagree with the reasoning and \r\n  analysis of the majority in regard to the issue of attractive nuisance.Â  The \r\n  holding of the majority misconstrues and misapplies the law extant in reference \r\n  to the doctrine of attractive nuisance.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE and REMAND for \r\n  trial disposition.\r\n \r\n  FACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n    BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nHunt commenced this action against \r\n  International Paper Company [22] \r\n   (â€œIPCâ€) in her capacity as guardian ad litem and court-appointed \r\n  representative for the late Terry Henson (â€œTerryâ€).Â  The complaint alleged wrongful \r\n  death, attractive nuisance, and unguarded dangerous condition.Â  IPC answered, \r\n  pleading affirmative defenses of comparative negligence and sole negligence \r\n  of others.Â  The issue of liability was bifurcated from the trial of punitive \r\n  damages.\r\nIPC owns and operates a canal, which \r\n  runs twenty-seven miles through Georgetown County, eventually terminating in \r\n  the city of Georgetown.Â  The depth of the canal ranges from twelve to twenty \r\n  feet depending on conditions.Â  Because of the waterâ€™s coloration, one looking \r\n  into the water would not be able to judge the canalâ€™s depth.\r\n Water flows through the canal assisted \r\n  by a number of pumping stations to what is known as the Church Street pumping \r\n  station.Â  Located close to Georgetown High and Georgetown Middle Schools, the \r\n  Church Street pumping station separates the schools from residential and commercial \r\n  areas.Â  When water reaches the Church Street pumping station, large electric \r\n  pumps push the water through an underground pipe forty-two inches in diameter.Â  \r\n  The pipe runs from the pumping station to a paper mill.Â  The pumps typically \r\n  push 19,000 gallons of water per minute through the pipe, and this is the flow \r\n  rate at which the pumps were operating on the day in question.\r\nAccess roads used for maintenance \r\n  are located along the entire length of the canal.Â  Employees of IPC traverse \r\n  these roads inspecting the canal Monday through Friday.Â  With the exception \r\n  of some small areas near the schools, the canal is not fenced.Â  Although an \r\n  employee testified IPC put up no trespassing signs when the canal was first \r\n  constructed, the signs â€œdidnâ€™t stay.â€Â  IPC does not dispute there were no warning \r\n  signs in place at the time of the events in question.\r\nOn April 25, 1998, \r\n  ten-year-old Terry and his older brother went to the home of Terryâ€™s friend, \r\n  Donnie Lippert.Â  Another friend, Dustin, had been riding his go-cart near the \r\n  canal and wanted to show the boys a â€œdirt jumping hill.â€Â  With this in mind, \r\n  the boys walked to the canal.Â  Upon arriving, they entered the canal property \r\n  via a dirt path located along a fence protecting the Church Street pumping station.\r\nThe boys eventually \r\n  walked towards a pipe that crosses the canal.Â  The pipe extends from the bank \r\n  on one side of the canal, runs across the water, and into the bank on the other \r\n  side of the canal.Â  Metal bracing, which serves as support for the pipe, gives \r\n  it a bridge-type look.Â  Due to the construction, the pipe is known as the â€œpipe \r\n  bridge.â€\r\nDonnie testified \r\n  that Terry saw the pipe and wanted to walk across it to the other side of the \r\n  canal.Â  Arriving on the other side, the boys found a cast net and Terry decided \r\n  he could use the rope from the cast net to â€œhold on while he got into the water.â€Â  \r\n  After being in the water for a short period of time, Terry attempted to climb \r\n  out using the metal support structure.Â  Although his friends were grasping the \r\n  rope and he was clenching onto the metal supports, Terry slipped and his friends \r\n  were unable to hold on to the rope.\r\nDonnie averred \r\n  that even though the water looked calm, after the boys lost their grip on the \r\n  rope, Terry was swept down the canal very quickly.Â  Terryâ€™s brother declared \r\n  that Terry traveled so fast down the canal towards the Church Street pumping \r\n  station they were unable to reach him in time to help.Â  It is undisputed Terry \r\n  drowned.Â  \r\nIPC stipulated \r\n  (1) it knew of at least three other drownings that have taken place in the canal; \r\n  and (2) two of victims were good swimmers. \r\nAt trial, IPC moved \r\n  for, and was granted, a directed verdict on the applicability of the attractive \r\n  nuisance doctrine to the facts of the case.Â  The trial court ruled, â€œThe case \r\n  law indicates that the reason they needed to have gone [to the canal] was that \r\n  they were attracted by this nuisance, it was attractive nuisance and the evidence \r\n  in this case is clear they went [to the canal] for another purpose and then \r\n  went to this, this site.â€Â  Hunt argues the ruling was error.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n   Did the trial court err in granting \r\n    a directed verdict and failing to charge attractive nuisance where the decedent \r\n    was attracted to the water in which he drowned, but entered the property for \r\n    another reason?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe grant or denial of new trial \r\n  motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge and his decision will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly unsupported by the \r\n  evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.â€Â  Stevens \r\n  v.

Asheville &amp; Spartanburg R.R. Co. 25 S.C. 24 \r\n  (1885).Â  In Bridger, a case concerning injuries to a minor, our Supreme \r\n  Court adopted the position championed in what has come to be known as the â€œturntable \r\n  cases.â€Â  Id.; see, e.g., R.R. Co. v. Stout, 84 U.S. 657, \r\n  21 L. Ed. 745 (1873) (holding that a child could recover for injuries caused \r\n  as a result of the failure of the railroad company to keep its turntable locked \r\n  or guarded).Â  In ruling that the question of liability was for the jury, the \r\n  Bridger Court placed emphasis on the fact that â€œthere was testimony that \r\n  the turntable was a dangerous machine; that it was left and located in an exposed \r\n  place, easily accessible, unguarded, unfenced and unlocked and that the plaintiff \r\n  was of that age when he was incapable of . . . appreciating [its] danger.â€Â  \r\n  25 S.C. at 29. \r\nFollowing Bridger, \r\n  South Carolina courts have had many opportunities to develop the doctrine of \r\n  attractive nuisance.Â  See Franks v. S. Cotton Oil Co., 78 S.C. \r\n  10, 58 S.E. 960 (1907); McLendon v. Hampton Cotton Mills Co., 109 S.C. \r\n  238, 95 S.E. 781 (1917); Sexton v. Noll Constr. Co., 108 S.C. 516, 95 \r\n  S.E. 129 (1918); Renno v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 120 S.C. 7, 112 S.E. \r\n  439 (1922); Hart v. Union Mfg. &amp; Power Co., 157 S.C. 174, 154 S.E. \r\n  118 (1930); Bannister v. F.W. Poe Mfg. Co., 162 S.C. 1, 160 S.E. 138 \r\n  (1931); Hancock v. Aiken Mills, Inc., 180 S.C. 93, 185 S.E. 188 (1936); \r\n  Perrin v. Rainwater, 186 S.C. 181, 195 S.E. 283 (1938); Daniels v. \r\n  Timmons, 216 S.C. 539, 59 S.E.2d 149 (1950); Bush v. Aiken Elec. Co-op., \r\n  Inc., 226 S.C. 442, 85 S.E.2d 716 (1955).\r\nExpanding on the \r\n  ideals expressed in Bridger, Franks v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., \r\n  78 S.C. 10, 58 S.E. 960 (1907), articulated what would become the foundation \r\n  of our current law on the doctrine.Â  In Franks, the Court sustained a \r\n  denial of defendantâ€™s demurrer with regard to a complaint alleging attractive \r\n  nuisance, when a child under ten years old drowned in a reservoir located on \r\n  defendantâ€™s property, where young children were known to play.Â  Id. at \r\n  12, 58 S.E. at 963.Â  In reaching its decision, the Court adopted the following \r\n  excerpt from Thompson on Negligence Â§ 1030:\r\n\r\n  We now come to a class of decisions \r\n    which hold the landowner liable in damages in the case of children injured \r\n    by dangerous things suffered to exist unguarded on his premises, where they \r\n    are accustomed to some [sic] with or without license.Â  These decisions proceed \r\n    on one or the other of two grounds: (1) That where the owner or occupier of \r\n    grounds brings or artificially creates something thereon which from its nature \r\n    is especially attractive to children, and which at the same time is dangerous \r\n    to them, he is bound, in the exercise of social duty and the ordinary offices \r\n    of humanity, to take reasonable pains to see that such dangerous things are \r\n    so guarded that children will not be injured by coming in contact with them.Â  \r\n    (2) That although the dangerous thing may not be what is termed an â€˜attractive \r\n    nuisanceâ€™--that is to say, may not have especial attraction for children by \r\n    reason of their childish instincts--yet where it is so left exposed that they \r\n    are likely to come in contact with it, and where their coming in contact with \r\n    it is obviously dangerous to them, the person so exposing the dangerous thing \r\n    should reasonably anticipate the injury that is likely to happen to them from \r\n    its being so exposed, and is bound to take reasonable pains to guard it, so \r\n    as to prevent injury to them.\r\n\r\nId. at 15, \r\n  58 S.E. at 963 (emphasis added).\r\nThe attractive nuisance aspect of \r\n  the Franks decision did not depend on whether the child was actually attracted \r\n  to the property on which he was injured, rather the question was whether the \r\n  landowner maintained a dangerous condition on his property that appealed to \r\n  â€œchildish instincts and impulses.â€Â  Id. at 13, 58 S.E. at 962 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  Although collateral to the issue currently being addressed, in the years following \r\n  the decision, several courts recognized the alternate ground for recovery based \r\n  not on the attractiveness of instrumentality, but its dangerousness.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., Everett v. White, 245 S.C. 331, 140 S.E.2d 582 (1965) (reaffirming \r\n  adoption of the doctrine).\r\nA review of cases applying the attractive \r\n  nuisance doctrine articulated in Franks proves instructive.Â  In Hayes \r\n  v. Southern Power Co., 95 S.C. 230, 78 S.E. 956 (1913), the Court upheld \r\n  a jury verdict based upon attractive nuisance where defendant maintained live \r\n  electrical wires just inside a window of a building, near which children were \r\n  known to play.Â  Id. at 233, 78 S.E. at 958.Â  The Court based its decision \r\n  primarily on the principles articulated in Franks.Â  Id. at 239, \r\n  78 S.E. at 960.Â  The decision does not question why the injured child was on \r\n  the property of the defendant.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn Hart v. Union \r\n  Manufacturing &amp; Power Co., 157 S.C. 174, 154 S.E. 118 (1930), a young \r\n  child was electrocuted after climbing a metal electrical tower.Â  Id. \r\n  at 181-82, 154 S.E. at 121.Â  There was no evidence the child was attracted to \r\n  the defendantâ€™s property because of the existence of the dangerous tower itself.Â  \r\n  Instead, testimony showed it was common knowledge that the area in which the \r\n  tower was located was â€œpeculiarly attractive to children.â€Â  Id. at 183, \r\n  154 S.E. at 121.Â  Although there was no direct evidence proving the defendant \r\n  knew children played around the tower, the Court held the jury could infer knowledge \r\n  from the fact that â€œ[a]ll about the tower were indications that the grounds \r\n  were used constantly by children at play.â€Â  Id. at 185, 154 S.E. at 122.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nThe courtâ€™s ruling in the instant \r\n  case and IPCâ€™s position on appeal â€“ that the child must be attracted to the \r\n  property by the device that causes injury â€“ appear to be based primarily on \r\n  the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Hancock v. Aiken Mills, Inc., 180 S.C. \r\n  93, 185 S.E. 188 (1936).Â  In Hancock, a thirteen-year-old boy was seriously \r\n  burned after standing near a fire built in the yard of his home by the defendants.Â  \r\n  Id. at 95, 185 S.E. at 189.Â  The child testified he went near the fire \r\n  to report on a personal errand to one of the defendants, not because he was \r\n  attracted to it.Â  Id. at 100, 185 S.E. at 191.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Hancock \r\n  Court relied primarily on the decision in Sexton v. Noll Construction Co., \r\n  108 S.C. 516, 95 S.E. 129 (1918), to find these facts did not support a cause \r\n  of action for attractive nuisance.Â  In Sexton, children were attracted \r\n  to a mound of sand situated on a vacant lot.Â  Id. at 520, 95 S.E. at \r\n  130.Â  The attraction consisted of â€œrolling downâ€ the hill, an activity which, \r\n  taken alone, involves little danger.Â  Id.Â  However, a â€œpotâ€ of boiling \r\n  asphalt was located nearby.Â  Id.Â  As the plaintiff was leaving the sand \r\n  mound, he walked by the pot and was injured when some of the asphalt sprayed \r\n  onto him.Â  Id. at 521, 95 S.E. at 130.Â  The Court reversed a verdict \r\n  for the plaintiff based on the absence of proximate cause.Â  Id. at 522-523, \r\n  95 S.E. at 131.Â  The Court explained that â€œthe plaintiff . . . was not playing \r\n  with the pot at the time of injury; nor was his conduct influenced in any respect \r\n  by reason of the fact that the pot was obviously dangerous on account of its \r\n  exposed condition.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  The Court based its decision \r\n  on the lack of attraction to the instrumentality causing injury, not that the \r\n  child was on the property for another reason.\r\nAfter determining \r\n  the reasoning of Sexton disposed of the attractive nuisance issue, the \r\n  Hancock Court cited authorities from other jurisdictions in support of \r\n  its conclusion. 180 S.C. at 103-104, 185 S.E. at 193.Â  While this authority \r\n  stands for the proposition championed by IPC and the trial court â€“ i.e., that \r\n  a plaintiff cannot recover unless he or she goes onto the property by reason \r\n  of the attraction to the device which is found to be the attractive nuisance \r\n  â€“, such authority was not necessary to the decision in the case.Â  Id.\r\nAlthough in the \r\n  past this position was accepted by a number of jurisdictions, see United \r\n  Zinc &amp; Chemical Co. v. Britt, 258 U.S. 268, 42 S.Ct. 299, 66 L.Ed. 615 \r\n  (1922) (holding same), the principle is now generally rejected.Â  See \r\n  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 339 cmt. b (1965).Â  Section 339 of the Restatement \r\n  provides:\r\n \r\n  A possessor of land is subject \r\n    to liability for physical harm to children trespassing thereon caused by an \r\n    artificial condition upon the land if\r\n   (a) the place where the condition \r\n    exists is one upon which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children \r\n    are likely to trespass, and\r\n   (b) the condition is one of which \r\n    the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should \r\n    realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm \r\n    to such children, and\r\n   (c) the children because of their \r\n    youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling \r\n    with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and\r\n   (d) the utility to the possessor \r\n    of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are \r\n    slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and\r\n   (e) the possessor fails to exercise \r\n    reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.\r\n\r\nAs the drafters \r\n  of the Restatement explain, â€œ[i]t is now recognized by most of the courts that \r\n  the basis of the rule is merely the ordinary negligence basis of a duty of reasonable \r\n  care not to inflict foreseeable harm on another, and that the fact that the \r\n  child is a trespasser is merely one of the facts to be taken into consideration.â€Â  \r\n  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 339 cmt. b; see also 62 Am. Jur. 2d Premises \r\n  Â§Â§ 313, 316 (1990) (noting attractiveness requirement has been relegated to \r\n  little importance, or more commonly, disposed of altogether).\r\nPre-Hancock cases demonstrate \r\n  and post-Hancock cases confirm South Carolina has never been one of the \r\n  few jurisdictions which adhere to this rule.Â  In Perrin v. Rainwater, \r\n  186 S.C. 181, 195 S.E. 283 (1938), a cause of action under attractive nuisance \r\n  was stated when a seven-year-old girl, while on appellantâ€™s property for dance \r\n  class, was attracted to a fire escape and fell to her death.Â  Id. at \r\n  185-186, 195 S.E. at 284.\r\nSimilarly, in Daniels \r\n  v. Timmons, 216 S.C. 539, 59 S.E.2d 149 (1950), tenants in an apartment \r\n  complex stated a cause of action for attractive nuisance, when their fifteen-month-old \r\n  son was attracted to and injured by a defective stairway located on the rented \r\n  property.Â  Id.; see also Lynch v. Motel Enters., Inc., \r\n  248 S.C. 490, 151 S.E.2d 435 (1966) (finding it a jury question whether or not \r\n  child was attracted to the pool in which he drowned).\r\nIn Kirven v. \r\n  Askins, 253 S.C. 110, 169 S.E.2d 139 (1969), a child was injured by being \r\n  struck with a clod of dirt or clay while on the property of the defendant.Â  \r\n  Id. at 112, 169 S.E.2d at 139.Â  Although it was known to all parties \r\n  that children frequented the premises, there was no evidence to suggest the \r\n  children were attracted to the premises by the desire to throw dirt clods.Â  \r\n  Id. at 113-114, 169 S.E.2d at 140.Â  The main issue in Kirven concerned \r\n  whether the clods of dirt could be considered â€œunreasonably dangerous to children.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 115, 169 S.E.2d at 141.Â  Based on the facts of the case, the Court \r\n  found that a clod of dirt â€œwas not a dangerous thing or instrumentality as is \r\n  required to establish liability under either the attractive nuisance doctrine \r\n  or the alternate ground of recovery stated in Everett v. White.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 117, 169 S.E.2d at 141.\r\nConcerning the \r\n  prerequisites for sustaining a cause of action based on attractive nuisance, \r\n  the Kirven Court explicated: â€œ[I]t is necessary that the condition or \r\n  instrumentality which caused the injury, should have actually attracted the \r\n  child into danger.Â  It follows that the doctrine is not applicable where the \r\n  injured child went into the dangerous situation for some other reason.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 117, 169 S.E.2d at 142.Â  Had the Court stopped its commentary here, I would \r\n  be in total agreement, as this is a correct interpretation of the law of attractive \r\n  nuisance as it has developed in South Carolina.Â  However, the Court went on \r\n  to quote the language from Hancock requiring the child to be on the property \r\n  because of the attractiveness of the instrumentality causing injury.Â  Id.\r\nA review of the \r\n  facts in the current case elucidates the contrariety of the two statements.Â  \r\n  It is undisputed the children went to the canal property for a reason unrelated \r\n  to the canal itself and there were no signs warning of the dangers posed by \r\n  the water or effective fencing to prevent unsuspecting children from coming \r\n  into contact with it.Â  One of the boys testified that once on the property, \r\n  Terry saw the pipe bridge and wanted to walk across it.Â  He further maintained \r\n  that upon finding a cast net on the other side of the pipe bridge, Terry got \r\n  the idea to tie the rope from the net around his waist so he could enter the \r\n  water of the canal.\r\nUnder the first \r\n  explanation in Kirven, Terry would clearly meet the prerequisites for \r\n  maintaining an attractive nuisance action.Â  Explicably, the â€œinstrumentality \r\n  which caused the injury . . . actually attracted the child into danger.â€Â  Kirven, \r\n  253 S.C. at 117, 169 S.E.2d at 142.Â  Terry was attracted to the pipe bridge, \r\n  and it was the accessibility of this pipe bridge, coupled with the latent dangerousness \r\n  of the water in the canal, that created the danger.Â  Furthermore, there is no \r\n  evidence that Terry went into the dangerous situation, i.e., onto the pipe bridge \r\n  and into the water, â€œfor any other reasonâ€ than his attraction to the water.Â  \r\n  \r\nAlternatively, \r\n  if the second proposition is followed, the fact that Terry was attracted to \r\n  the dangerous condition has no consequence whatsoever even if IPC knew children \r\n  often frequented the property.Â  Once it is determined Terry and his friends \r\n  entered the property without the canal in mind, the analysis ends.Â  To follow \r\n  this position would undermine nearly every case decided to date in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  It would emasculate the idea that the doctrine of attractive nuisance is one \r\n  â€œbased upon humanity and the wholesome maxim, â€˜Sic utere tuo ut alienum non \r\n  laedasâ€™ [(So use your own as to not injure anotherâ€™s property)].â€Â  Franks \r\n  v. S. Cotton Oil Co., 78 S.C. 10, 19, 58 S.E. 960, 963 (1907).\r\nTherefore, I find \r\n  that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict as to Terryâ€™s cause \r\n  of action for attractive nuisance.Â  The issue should have been submitted to \r\n  the jury.\r\nFinally, IPC asserts \r\n  as an additional sustaining ground that, even if the trial court erred in not \r\n  sending the attractive nuisance cause of action to the jury, this error is harmless.Â  \r\n  Specifically, IPC argues, â€œ[W]hile the Plaintiff may have lost the attractive \r\n  nuisance doctrine, she retained the similar unguarded condition cause of action.â€\r\nJuxtaposition of the theories of \r\n  â€œattractive nuisanceâ€ and â€œunguarded conditionâ€ demonstrates with clarity the \r\n  dissimilarities of elements in each theory.Â  In contrariety to the argument \r\n  of IPC, there is no amalgamation of these theories in this case.Â  An academic \r\n  review of the law of attractive nuisance reveals a separate and distinct cognizable \r\n  theory of the common law with venerable origins.\r\nBecause it is axiomatic that a party \r\n  may bring as many causes of action as he or she may have, I find this argument \r\n  to be without merit.Â  See Rule 8, SCRCP (noting a party may state as \r\n  many separate causes of action as he has regardless of their consistency).\r\n \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased \r\n  on an illogical and strait-jacket analysis, the majority engrafts on the doctrine \r\n  of attractive nuisance an exception: the child was not attracted \r\n  to the venue by the dangerous condition.Â  This ill-conceived notion and idea \r\n  ignores the reality of the case sub judice.Â  Incipiently, the \r\n  child visited the venue for â€œhill jumping purposesâ€ but was attracted to the \r\n  dangerous condition existing at the venue: â€œthe canal.â€\r\nThe factual duality of this case, \r\n  i.e., the initial non-attraction and the actual attraction to the dangerous \r\n  condition proves the necessity to recognize the position articulated by Â§ 339 \r\n  of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965).\r\nRelying upon Hancock v. Aiken \r\n  Mills, Inc., 180 S.C. 93, 185 S.E. 188 (1936), the majority eviscerates \r\n  the basic doctrine of attractive nuisance. Â The factual dissimilarities of Hancock \r\n  and the present case dissuade the Court from any precedential impact of Hancock.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the actual holding in Hancock does not give \r\n  credence to the conclusion that the doctrine of attractive nuisance has no efficacy \r\n  if there is no initial attraction of the child to the dangerous condition.\r\nAn academic review of Hancock \r\n  leads to the ineluctable conclusion that a venue may be bifurcated in the originality \r\n  of the attraction and the attraction of an actual dangerous condition at the \r\n  same site.\r\nThe holding of the majority renders \r\n  the attractive nuisance doctrine impotent and non-utilitarian.Â  This result \r\n  is neither warranted nor desirable in South Carolina jurisprudence.\r\nThe most troubling and vexatious \r\n  aspect of the ruling of the majority is the failure to recognize the attraction \r\n  of the child to this dangerous condition existing on the property.Â  Several \r\n  children have already drowned in this canal; yet, the majority creates a legalistic \r\n  and protective barrier against the application of the doctrine of attractive \r\n  nuisance.\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, \r\n  I VOTE to AFFIRM IN PART, REVERSE IN PART, and REMAND for trial \r\n  disposition.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The complaint originally included Georgetown Steel Corporation, \r\n    the City of Georgetown, and Georgetown County as defendants.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  SeeÂ  Creighton v.

W. Pat Paschal, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJohn R. Devlin, Jr., Christopher R. Antley, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:Â  Palmetto Homes, Inc. (â€œContractorâ€) \r\n  sued Philip Bradley, Chad Summerall, B&amp;S Masonry, Inc., Bradley and Summerall \r\n  Masonry, Inc. (collectively â€œSubcontractorâ€), asserting causes of action for \r\n  breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, breach \r\n  of warranty, and negligence.Â  In response, Subcontractor pled a previously obtained \r\n  arbitration award as a bar to Contractorâ€™s causes of action, simultaneously \r\n  moving to confirm the arbitration award.Â  The circuit court confirmed the arbitration \r\n  award and entered judgment in favor of Subcontractor.Â  Contractor moved to vacate \r\n  the award and compel another arbitration, arguing it had not been provided notice \r\n  of the arbitration proceeding and thus had not appeared to defend it.Â  The circuit \r\n  court denied the motion to vacate the arbitration award, ruling Contractor had \r\n  been provided notice. Additionally, the court granted Subcontractorâ€™s motion \r\n  to dismiss Contractorâ€™s claims, ruling they were barred by res judicata.Â  Contractor \r\n  appeals.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nContractor is a residential homebuilder.Â  Contractor entered into \r\n  a contract with Subcontractor, whereby Subcontractor agreed to provide the masonry \r\n  work on a residential homebuilding project.Â  The contract between the parties \r\n  provided for the arbitration of disputes with the American Arbitration Association \r\n  (â€œAAAâ€).Â  Specifically it read:\r\n\r\nArbitration: Should a dispute \r\n  arise between the contractor and sub-contractor as to any matter concerning \r\n  the within sub-contractor agreement and or any work performed, materials furnished \r\n  on payment made or requested for same, said dispute shall be resolved in accordance \r\n  with the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis as in original).Â  \r\nFollowing Subcontractorâ€™s completion of \r\n  the masonry work, Contractor asserted there were defects in the masonry work \r\n  and refused to pay Subcontractor.Â  Subcontractor then filed a demand for arbitration \r\n  with the AAA, asserting a claim for a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Contractor never responded \r\n  to the demand for arbitration.Â  \r\nAfter numerous notices were mailed and \r\n  faxed to Contractor by the AAA, the arbitration took place without the participation \r\n  of Contractor, and the arbitrator issued an award in favor of Subcontactor.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nFollowing the arbitration award, Contractor brought \r\n  this action asserting causes of action for breach of contract, breach of contract \r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act, breach of warranty, and negligence.Â  \r\nSubcontractor filed a Petition to Confirm Arbitration \r\n  Award, and the circuit court issued an order confirming the arbitration award \r\n  and entering judgment.Â  Contractor then filed and served a motion to vacate \r\n  the arbitration award and compel another arbitration of the dispute, arguing \r\n  Rule 4, South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, applied, and Contractor never \r\n  received proper notice of the arbitration proceedings.Â  Subcontractor then filed \r\n  and served its motion to dismiss Contractorâ€™s action on the grounds that res \r\n  judicata barred the suit.Â  \r\nThe circuit court denied Contractorâ€™s motion to \r\n  vacate, ruling numerous attempts were made to serve and provide notice of the \r\n  arbitration proceedings, but Contractor intentionally avoided service.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the circuit court granted Subcontractorâ€™s motion to dismiss Contractorâ€™s causes \r\n  of action on the grounds of res judicata.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Contractorâ€™s Motion to \r\n  Vacate the Arbitration Award\r\nContractor argues the circuit court erred by finding \r\n  Contractor received service of process because the service did not comply with \r\n  Rule 4, South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. \r\n  [1] Â  We hold Palmetto received sufficient service of process and affirm \r\n  as modified.Â  \r\nAn appellate court may affirm the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling using any sustaining grounds that are both raised by the respondentâ€™s \r\n  brief and found within the record.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. \r\n  Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).\r\nIn the present case, the contract signed by the \r\n  parties specifically stated the rules and regulations of the AAA apply to the \r\n  arbitration.Â  Thus, we analyze whether service of process was effected pursuant \r\n  to the AAA rules.Â  See Dowling v. Home Buyers Warranty Corp. II, \r\n  311 S.C. 233, 236, 428 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1993) (holding an agreement to arbitrate \r\n  is a contract, and the parties are free to determine its terms); see also \r\n  Simmons v. Lucas &amp; Stubbs Assocs., Ltd., 283 S.C. 326, 332-33, 322 \r\n  S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding arbitration is a matter of contract, \r\n  and the range of issues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of \r\n  the agreement); Marolf Const. Inc. v. Allenâ€™s Paving Co., 572 S.E.2d \r\n  861, 863 (N.C. Ct.

Frank M. Hall &amp; Co., 343 S.C. \r\n  396, 399, 540 S.E.2d 864, 865 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Arbitration is a matter of contract, \r\n  and the range of issues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of \r\n  the agreement.Â  Simmons, 283 S.C. at 332-33, 322 S.E.2d at 470.Â  \r\nâ€œTo decide whether an arbitration agreement \r\n  encompasses a dispute, a court must determine whether the factual allegations \r\n  underlying the claim are within the scope of the broad arbitrationÂ  clause . \r\n  . . . [U]nless the court can say with positive assurance the arbitrationÂ  clause \r\n  . . . [does] not cover[] the dispute, arbitration should be ordered.â€Â  South \r\n  Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal (Kentucky), Inc., 312 S.C. 559, \r\n  563, 437 S.E.2d 22, 25 (1993).\r\nThe arbitration agreement states, â€œany \r\n  matter concerning the within sub-contractor agreement and or any work performedâ€ \r\n  will be subject to arbitration.Â  (emphasis as in original).Â  \r\nThe partiesâ€™ agreement provided Subcontractor \r\n  would perform masonry work for Contractorâ€™s homebuilding project.Â  Contractorâ€™s \r\n  causes of action for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act and \r\n  negligence essentially allege Subcontractor defectively installed the masonry \r\n  work on a residential homebuilding project. \r\n  [6] Â Â Â  These claims are matters concerning the agreement or the work performed.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the claims are within the scope of the arbitration agreement.Â  See \r\n  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 597-98, 553 S.E.2d 110, \r\n  119 (2001) (holding where the partnership agreement provided all claims arising \r\n  from the partnership agreement were to be arbitrated, any torts related to the \r\n  partnership agreement were also matters for arbitration); Long v.

Felger, \r\n  318 S.C. 340, 344, 457 S.E.2d 626, 628 (Ct. App. 1995).Â Â  \r\nIntially, we note, an arbitration award is a final, \r\n  binding award on the merits.Â  See Pittman Mortg. Co. v. Edwards, \r\n  327 S.C. 72, 76, 488 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1997) (â€œGenerally, an arbitration award \r\n  is conclusive and courts will refuse to review the merits of an award.â€); Trident \r\n  Technical Coll. v. Lucas &amp; Stubbs, Ltd., 286 S.C. 98, 111, 333 S.E.2d \r\n  781, 788-89 (1985) (holding an arbitration award is meant to signify the end, \r\n  not the commencement, of litigation; thus, arbitration awards are presumptively \r\n  correct).Â  Furthermore, it is uncontested the parties in the first arbitration \r\n  proceeding are the same parties in this litigation.Â  Thus, we need only determine \r\n  if the causes of action for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act \r\n  and negligence involved matter properly included in the first action.\r\nContractor, by its own admission, began discovering \r\n  defects in the brick work in the fall of 2000.Â  It was subsequently served process \r\n  of the arbitration proceedings over the course of several months beginning in \r\n  December of 2000, and the arbitration award was granted in April 2001.Â  Contractor \r\n  did not participate in the proceedings, and thus, it did not present any of \r\n  its claims to the arbitrators.Â  \r\nContractorâ€™s failure to participate in the proceedings \r\n  did not preclude its claims from being submitted to the arbitration proceeding.Â  \r\n  Rather, pursuant to the contract, all claims arising from the agreement were \r\n  to be submitted to arbitration.Â  see District of Columbia v. Bailey, \r\n  171 U.S. 161, 171 (1898) (holding a submission is an agreement between two or \r\n  more parties to refer a dispute to a third party and be bound by the third partiesâ€™ \r\n  decision); H.S.

Â§ 88 (holding an agreement to arbitrate \r\n  all issues arising from a contract submits all issues within the scope of the \r\n  contract to the arbitrators).Â  \r\nAs previously noted, Contractorâ€™s claims arose from \r\n  the Subcontractor agreement, and thus, its claims were within the scope of arbitration.Â  \r\n  Therefore, when the arbitration proceedings began, all claims arising from the \r\n  contract were submitted to the arbitration proceeding, and, as with civil litigation, \r\n  Contractor was procedurally required to arbitrate all claims arising therefrom \r\n  or be barred by res judicata.Â  See 4 Am. Jur. 2d Alternative Dispute \r\n  Resolution Â§ 214 (1995) (â€œThe award of the arbitrators acting within the \r\n  scope of their authority determines the rights of the parties as effectually \r\n  as a judgment secured by regular legal procedure . . . . [Thus,] [i]f otherwise \r\n  sufficient, an arbitration award is conclusive and binding . . . as to all matters \r\n  submitted to the arbitrators, even though one of the parties neglects to present \r\n  portions of his claim.â€) (emphasis added); see Rodgers Builders, \r\n  Inc. v. McQueen, 331 S.E.2d 726, 730 (N.C. Ct.

Fox, 587 So.2d 1 (La. Ct. App. 1991).\r\nNotwithstanding the traditional res judicata analysis, \r\n  Contractor argues, in an arbitration setting, res judicata only bars claims \r\n  that were actually arbitrated, not claims that merely could have been arbitrated.Â  \r\n  In that regard, Contractor predicates its contention on Renaissance Enterprises, \r\n  Inc. v. Ocean Resorts, Inc., 330 S.C. 13, 496 S.E.2d 858 (1998).\r\nIn Renaissance, our Supreme Court stated \r\n  in a footnote:\r\n\r\nRes judicata can only apply to those matters included within \r\n  the submission agreement.Â  4 Am. Jur. 2d Alternative Dispute Resolution Â§ \r\n  214 (1995) (arbitrator is limited to decide only those issues submitted \r\n  by the parties and res judicata may bar only issues submitted).Â  The issue of \r\n  . . . [plaintiffâ€™s] right to future fees was not submitted for arbitration in \r\n  the prior proceeding.Â Â Â Â Â  Therefore, . . . [plaintiff] is not precluded from \r\n  raising this issue once it becomes entitled to the fees . . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 17, 496 S.E.2d at 860.Â  Contractor \r\n  contends this passage establishes that res judicata only applies to issues actually \r\n  litigated in an arbitration proceeding and not to issues that could have been \r\n  litigated.Â  We do not read Renaissance so broadly.\r\nIn Renaissance, the plaintiff arbitrated \r\n  its disputes against the defendant for breaches of the contract that occurred \r\n  prior to the arbitration.Â  The arbitrator then issued an award encompassing \r\n  the breaches occurring prior to the arbitration but did not rule the contract \r\n  was rescinded.Â  Subsequently, the plaintiff brought another action against Defendant \r\n  to recover damages for the breaches of contract occurring after the original \r\n  arbitration award.Â  In response, the Defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming \r\n  res judicata barred the action because the prior arbitration award terminated \r\n  the contract.Â  The circuit court dismissed the action, ruling the arbitration \r\n  award terminated the contract.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court reversed and remanded, ruling \r\n  further inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding the arbitration \r\n  award was necessary to clarify the application of the law, and thus, summary \r\n  judgment was inappropriate.Â  On writ of certiorari, our supreme court vacated \r\n  this Court, ruling the issue was not properly preserved at the trial level.Â  \r\n\r\nReading Renaissance as a whole, we believe \r\n  the supreme courtâ€™s footnote merely reflected that the plaintiff could not have \r\n  been required to submit issues, or arbitrate breaches of contract, that had \r\n  not yet occurred.Â  In the present case, Contractorâ€™s claims existed at the time \r\n  of the original arbitration and thus could have been arbitrated in the original \r\n  proceeding.Â  Consequently, Renaissance is inapposite.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Rule 4 requires service of process on a corporation \r\n    by personal service or by â€œregistered or certified mail, return receipt requested \r\n    and delivery restricted to the addressee.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  As an ancillary argument, Contractor contends the circuit court erred \r\n    by ruling Contractor received service of process pursuant to Patel v. Southern \r\n    Brokerâ€™s Ltd., 277 S.C. 490, 493-95, 289 S.E.2d 642, 644-45 (1982) (holding \r\n    a defendant cannot avoid process of the court by intentionally avoiding service).Â  \r\n    However, having ruled service of process was sufficient pursuant to the AAA \r\n    rules, we need not address this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] On petition for rehearing, \r\n    Contractor argues this Court erred by considering the AAA rules because the \r\n    rules were not within the record on appeal.Â  Although the rules are not within \r\n    our record on appeal, we take judicial notice of them.Â  See Hetrick \r\n    v. Friedman, 602 N.W.2d 603, 606 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (holding an appellate \r\n    court may take judicial notice of the AAA medical malpractice rules, where \r\n    the arbitration agreement stated it would be governed by them); see also \r\n    Jones v. Anderson Cotton Mills, 205 S.C. 247, 254, 31 S.E.2d 447, 449 \r\n    (1944) (holding the supreme court will take judicial notice of the existence \r\n    and content of a rule adopted by the Industrial Commission); Porter v. \r\n    South Carolina Pub.

Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, \r\n    76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised \r\n    for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon \r\n    by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€)Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Contractorâ€™s Summons and Complaint stated causes of action for breach \r\n    of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, breach of \r\n    warranty, and negligence.Â  The circuit court dismissed all of Contractorâ€™s \r\n    claims, ruling the causes of action were barred by res judicata.Â  Contractor \r\n    has only appealed the dismissal of its causes of action for breach of contract \r\n    accompanied by a fraudulent act and negligence.Â  Therefore, the dismissal \r\n    of Contractorâ€™s other causes of action are not before us on appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  Contractorâ€™s cause of action for breach of contract \r\n    accompanied by a fraudulent act alleges:\r\n  \r\n  [Subcontractor] did commit \r\n    an act of fraud by installing the brick veneer and other brick masonry products \r\n    on a dwelling without adequate code required wall ties, by using and installing \r\n    mortar mix which was mixed incorrectly, with the wrong material ratios, this \r\n    creating a defective, substandard, non-structural â€˜soft mortar,â€™ not suitable \r\n    for the veneer application, and not in accordance with standards of the industry \r\n    or structurally safe and per manufacturerâ€™s recommendations, by omitting the \r\n    â€˜air spaceâ€™ between house wall and brick veneer, by omitting flashing above \r\n    doors/windows as well as intentional defective sub-standard brick veneer construction \r\n    and installation process while concealing the same from the Plaintiff.\r\n  \r\n  Contractorsâ€™ cause of action \r\n    for negligence allegesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œ[Subcontractor]Â  . . . w[as] negligent and \r\n    reckless in the construction of the masonry product and the use of defective \r\n    masonry process.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3746","title":"State v.

McFadden, 342 S.C. \r\n  629, 632, 539 S.E.2d 387, 389 (2000) (citing Knox v. State, 340 S.C. \r\n  81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000); Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773 (1998); Hope v.

Bland, 318 \r\n  S.C. 315, 457 S.E.2d 611 (1995)).Â  We find the offense of auto-breaking does \r\n  not contain all the elements of auto-tampering.Â  Accordingly, we conclude auto-tampering \r\n  is not a lesser-included offense of auto-breaking.Â  \r\nSection 16-13-160 concerns the felony \r\n  offense of auto-breaking:\r\n\r\n  (A) It is unlawful for a person \r\n    to:\r\n  (1) break or attempt to \r\n    break into a motor vehicle or its compartment with the intent to steal \r\n    it or anything of value from it, or attached or annexed to it, or used \r\n    in connection with it or in the perpetration of any criminal offense\r\n\r\n.Â  .Â  . \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-160 (2003) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nSection 16-21-90, in contrast, concerns \r\n  the separate offense of auto- tampering:\r\n\r\n  A person who, with intent and without \r\n    right to do so, damages a vehicle or damages or removes any of its parts or \r\n    components is guilty of a misdemeanor.\r\n  A person who, without right to \r\n    do so and with intent to commit a crime, tampers with a vehicle or goes in \r\n    or on it or works or attempts to work any of its parts or components or sets \r\n    or attempts to set it in motion is guilty of a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-21-90 (2003).\r\nTo satisfy the first paragraph of \r\n  the auto-tampering statute, one must either intentionally damage a vehicle or \r\n  intentionally damage or remove vehicle parts.Â  The auto-breaking statute, however, \r\n  contains neither damage nor removal elements.Â  The essence of the auto-breaking \r\n  offense is the breaking into, or the attempt to break into, a vehicle with the \r\n  intent to steal it or anything of value from it.Â  As such, the conduct described \r\n  in the first paragraph of the auto-tampering statute cannot be considered a \r\n  lesser- included offense of auto-breaking.\r\nThe second paragraph of the auto-tampering \r\n  statute lists four additional means by which an individual can violate the statute:Â  \r\n  (1) tampering with the vehicle; (2) going in or on the vehicle; (3) working \r\n  or attempting to work any of the vehicleâ€™s parts or components; and (4) setting \r\n  or attempting to set the vehicle in motion.Â  Similar to our findings regarding \r\n  the first paragraph of section 16-21-90, we find the offense of auto-breaking \r\n  does not include any of these four types of conduct.Â  While it logically follows \r\n  that auto-tampering includes the intentional tampering with a vehicle, auto-breaking \r\n  does not include mere tampering.Â  Moreover, auto-breaking embraces an attempt, \r\n  while the auto-tampering statute reaches only completed acts.Â  Next, auto-tampering \r\n  could include an element of â€œgoing in or onâ€ the vehicle.Â  Such element does \r\n  not exist in auto-breaking, as one need not actually touch the vehicle to be \r\n  convicted of that crime.Â  Similarly, the â€œworkingâ€ or attempting to work any \r\n  of the vehicleâ€™s components is not contained in auto breaking, and one need \r\n  not work components in order to break into a vehicle.Â  Auto-breaking could involve \r\n  a vehicleâ€™s component parts, but only in the context of stealing, or attempting \r\n  to steal, â€œanything . . . attached or annexed toâ€ the vehicle.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-13-160.Â  Finally, auto-tampering also could include the act of setting \r\n  or attempting to set the vehicle in motion.Â  Such conduct clearly does not fall \r\n  under the â€œbreak or attempt to break intoâ€ language of the auto-breaking statute.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the four modes of conduct described in the second paragraph of section \r\n  16-21-90 cannot be properly considered as lesser-included offenses of section \r\n  16-13-160.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nAuto-tampering is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of auto-breaking.Â  The trial court properly refused to charge the auto-tampering \r\n  statute.Â  Arthurâ€™s convictions and sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and HOWARD, J., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  S.C.
