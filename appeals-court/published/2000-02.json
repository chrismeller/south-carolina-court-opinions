The trial \r\n  court sentenced him to a total of thirty-two years imprisonment. Tisdale appeals, \r\n  arguing the court erred in refusing to suppress tainted identifications and \r\n  in denying his motion for mistrial based on a violation of the court's sequestration \r\n  order. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nOn October 24, 1996, at approximately \r\n  10:57 a.m., a gunman robbed a branch of First Citizens Bank in North Charleston. \r\n  No one saw the robber before he entered or after he left the bank. The police \r\n  soon arrived and canvassed the area. Larry Fanning, who lived behind the bank \r\n  at the time, told the police he saw a late-model brown Cadillac in need of a \r\n  new muffler \"shooting\" up the alleyway around 11:00 a.m. Fanning described the \r\n  car as having a bright yellow paper license tag reading \"Your Car Store.\" \r\n  Through the distinctive tag, the police were able to trace ownership \r\n  of the car to Tisdale. Based on Fanning's subsequent identification of the car, \r\n  the police arrested Tisdale later that afternoon. \r\n  \r\nThe following morning, as Officer \r\n  Robert Myers assembled a photo line-up, a teller from First Citizens, Justine \r\n  Mood, telephoned and stated she had seen a report of Tisdale's arrest on television \r\n  the previous night and she believed Tisdale was the robber. \r\n  (1) Myers drove to the bank and took Mood's statement. While there, \r\n  Georgia Vannice, another teller, told him she had identified Tisdale from a \r\n  photo in a newspaper article about his arrest. (2) \r\n  She also gave Myers a written statement. Michelle Crawford, a \"floating\" temporary \r\n  for First Citizens, also identified Tisdale from the newspaper the morning after \r\n  the robbery and subsequently gave a statement to police. After these identifications, \r\n  Myers never completed the line-up preparation because the police decided it \r\n  would be futile. A few days later, however, Myers returned to the bank and showed \r\n  Vannice a photograph of Tisdale which she said depicted the robber. \r\n  \r\nOn \r\n  February 3, 1997, a Charleston County grand jury indicted Tisdale for entering \r\n  a bank with intent to steal, armed robbery, possession of a weapon during the \r\n  commission of a violent crime, and grand larceny. The case was tried before \r\n  a jury on November 17-19, 1997. Prior to opening statements, Tisdale moved to \r\n  sequester the witnesses. The trial court granted the motion, but exempted two \r\n  of the State's case agents from his ruling. Thereafter, Tisdale moved to suppress \r\n  the identifications of him made by the three tellers. The trial court held an \r\n  in camera hearing on the reliability of each teller's identification, \r\n  and denied the motion as to each witness.\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  jury found Tisdale guilty of all the charges. The trial court, however, set \r\n  aside the larceny conviction as a lesser included offense of armed robbery. \r\n  The court sentenced Tisdale to thirty years for armed robbery, thirty years \r\n  for entering a bank with intent to steal, concurrent, and two years for possessing \r\n  a gun during the crime, consecutive to the robbery sentence. Tisdale appeals, \r\n  arguing the trial court erred in permitting the tellers' in-court identifications, \r\n  and in refusing to grant a mistrial based on David Rykowski's violation of the \r\n  court's order sequestering all non-agent witnesses.\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Impropriety \r\n  of Identification Procedure\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nTisdale \r\n  first argues the trial court erred in failing to suppress the identifications \r\n  by Mood, Vannice and Crawford. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court. State \r\n  v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995); State \r\n  v. Brown, 333 S.C. 185, 508 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1998). Accordingly, a \r\n  trial court's decision to allow the in-court identification of an accused will \r\n  not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion or prejudicial legal error. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn \r\n  in-court identification of an accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court \r\n  identification procedure created \"a very substantial likelihood of irreparable \r\n  misidentification.\" Manson v. Brathwaite, \r\n  432 U.S. 98 (1977) (quoting Simmons \r\n  v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968)); State \r\n  v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 (1980). However, in this case, \r\n  the pre-trial identification of Tisdale by the three tellers was admissible \r\n  because the televised bond hearing and newspaper article were non-governmental \r\n  sources of the suggestiveness.\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  excluding improper identification testimony the \r\n  primary evil to be avoided is a \"very substantial likelihood of irreparable \r\n  misidentification.\" . . . It is the likelihood of misidentification which violates \r\n  a defendant's right to due process . . . . Suggestive confrontations are disapproved \r\n  because they increase the likelihood of misidentification, and unnecessarily \r\n  suggestive ones are condemned for the further reason that the increased chance \r\n  of misidentification is gratuitous.\r\n  \r\nNeil \r\n  v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972) (quoting Simmons, \r\n  390 U.S. at 384).\r\n  \r\n\"[R]eliability \r\n  is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony \r\n  . . . .\" Manson, 432 U.S. at \r\n  114 (citation omitted); see also \r\n  State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, \r\n  729, 259 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1979). However, \"[t]he purpose of a strict rule barring \r\n  evidence of unnecessarily suggestive confrontations would be to deter the police \r\n  from using a less reliable procedure where a more reliable one may be available \r\n  . . . .\" Neil, 409 U.S. at 199. \r\n  Therefore, the impetus behind the harsh remedy of exclusion is police deterrence. \r\n  Although the reliability of an identification may be affected by media identification, \r\n  no police deterrence would be achieved by excluding evidence where there has \r\n  been no governmental involvement. Thus, we hold that the Neil \r\n  analysis is inapplicable where there is a nongovernmental identification source. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA number \r\n  of other jurisdictions have held media identifications of an accused do not \r\n  constitute identification procedures for analysis under Neil \r\n  and its progeny. See United \r\n  States v. Peele, 574 F.2d 489 (9th Cir. 1978); United \r\n  States v. Zeiler, 470 F.2d 717 (3d Cir. 1972); State \r\n  v. Smith, 681 So.2d 980, 986 (La. App. 1996) (\"[t]he viewing of television \r\n  news coverage of a defendant's arrest is not an \"identification procedure\")(citing \r\n  State v. Daughtery, 563 So.2d \r\n  1171 (La. App. 1990)); State v. Lawrence, \r\n  700 S.W.2d 111 (Mo. Ct. App. 1985) (\"When the source of the alleged taint is \r\n  not governmental, the balancing test under Stovall \r\n  and Simmons is not applicable.\"); \r\n  State v. Brown, 528 N.E.2d 523 \r\n  (Ohio 1988).\r\n  \r\nIt \r\n  is uncontested that the media identifications in this case were suggestive. \r\n  See Simmons, \r\n  390 U.S. at 383 (identifications arising from single photo displays are generally \r\n  viewed with suspicion); Stovall v. \r\n  Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967) (show-ups, or showing a person singly for \r\n  identification, are widely condemned); State \r\n  v. Patrick, 318 S.C. 352, 457 S.E.2d 632 (Ct. App. 1995) (witness's prior \r\n  identification of defendant, which occurred in a courtroom while the defendant \r\n  was being tried for another crime, contained a degree of suggestiveness). However, \r\n  because the police were not involved in the media identifications in this case, \r\n  the trial judge did not err in allowing the tellers' identification testimony.\r\n  \r\nCourts \r\n  that have rejected the Neil \r\n  analysis have also recognized the possibility of a case \"where the mind of a \r\n  witness is so clouded by suggestions from nongovernment sources that a conviction \r\n  based principally on the testimony of that witness violates due process.\" Peele, \r\n  574 F.2d at 491; Lawrence, 700 \r\n  S.W.2d at 112 (\"We recognize that a case might arise in which an identification \r\n  of a defendant is so clouded by outside nongovernmental sources as to be totally \r\n  unreliable as a matter of law . . . .\"); see \r\n  also State v. Coburne, \r\n  518 P.2d 747, 753 (Wash. App. 1973) (\"[t]he publication of [a] newspaper picture \r\n  is considered an 'unarranged' photo show up. Conceivably, viewing it could have \r\n  implanted a suggestion to the [ ] eyewitnesses\"). \r\n  \r\nWe \r\n  are not convinced that the identification testimony admitted in this case violated \r\n  due process. All the tellers were fully cross-examined regarding their descriptions \r\n  and the suggestiveness of the media identification. \"The extent to which a suggestion \r\n  from nongovernment sources has influenced the memory or perception of the witness, \r\n  or the ability of the witness to articulate or relate the identifying characteristics \r\n  of the accused, is a proper issue for the trier of fact to determine.\" Peele, \r\n  574 F.2d at 491; see also Kubat \r\n  v. Thieret, 867 F.2d 351, 359 (7th Cir. 1989) (\"although [the \r\n  witness] expressed concern about seeing the picture in the newspaper, she testified \r\n  at trial only [the defendant] looked like the man in the bar, and her concerns \r\n  about the newspaper were disclosed to the jury -- thus her concerns went to \r\n  weight not admissibility\"); Zeiler, \r\n  470 F.2d 717 (When \"there is no evidence that law enforcement officials encouraged \r\n  or assisted in the impermissive identification procedures, the proper means \r\n  of testing eyewitness identification is through cross-examination.\"); Brown, \r\n  528 N.E.2d at 532 (\"The rationale for excluding a tainted pretrial identification \r\n  is to protect the defendant from misconduct by the state. . . . In the facts \r\n  before us, there was no state action. Hence, Manson \r\n  is inapplicable here. The alleged suggestiveness of the identification, therefore, \r\n  goes to weight and reliability of the testimony rather than admissibility. Moreover, \r\n  any prejudicial effect of the testimony could have been cured by effective cross-examination. \r\n  The testimony was properly admitted.\").\r\n  \r\nThe amount of time between the robbery \r\n  and the media identification was short, less than twenty-four hours. The tellers \r\n  all testified that they had ample time to observe the robber. Vannice testified \r\n  she never took her eyes off the robber for the entire forty-five seconds during \r\n  which the robbery occurred. She also stated that she was about \r\n  three feet away from the robber. Mood testified that she was inches away from \r\n  the robber as he pointed a gun at her and demanded the money. She stated she \r\n  had an unobstructed view of the robber and that the bank was well-lit. She testified \r\n  to looking at the robber for approximately thirty seconds during the incident. \r\n  Crawford testified that she was only a few feet from the robber. She stated \r\n  she focused on the robber the entire time \"[b]ecause it stuck in [her] head \r\n  to get as much information or as much a description as [she] probably [sic] \r\n  could to tell the police.\" \r\n  \r\nMood, Vannice and Crawford all testified \r\n  they were certain of their identifications. In making their identifications, \r\n  all three tellers mentioned the robber's distinctive chin structure. Crawford \r\n  testified that the robber's chin structure was the only facial feature she recalled. \r\n  Mood also maintained she told the police about the robber's distinctive chin \r\n  structure, but it was not included in the written statement. Vannice testified \r\n  to noticing the robber's chin structure, but stated that she didn't describe \r\n  it to the police because she \"didn't think it was necessary.\" \r\n  \r\nThe only direct evidence of the crime \r\n  was the videotape of the robbery and the three tellers' identifications. However, \r\n  there was other circumstantial evidence against Tisdale. Tisdale's car was seen \r\n  in the area around the time of the robbery. Fanning, the only other eyewitness, \r\n  identified a car belonging to Tisdale and stated that the driver \"looked like \r\n  a black male.\" The robber used a \"light tan\" or \"beige\" or \"brown\" grocery bag \r\n  in the robbery. A plastic Piggly Wiggly grocery bag was found in the trunk of \r\n  Tisdale's car. Finally, Major Russell Bernard testified he identified a scar \r\n  on Tisdale's arm from the bank videotape, and close-up photos of the scar were \r\n  admitted into evidence at trial. Because the tellers were fully cross-examined \r\n  concerning their identifications and other evidence against Tisdale was presented \r\n  during the trial, Tisdale's due process rights were not violated by the admission \r\n  of the identification testimony. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's allowance \r\n  of the identification testimony. (3)\r\n2. Violation \r\n  of Sequestration Order\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nTisdale also asserts the trial court \r\n  erred by refusing to grant a mistrial based on David Rykowski's violation of \r\n  the sequestration order. We disagree. \"The decision to grant or deny a motion \r\n  for a mistrial is a matter within a trial court's sound discretion, and such \r\n  a decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law.\" State v. Council, \r\n  335 S.C. 1, 12, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999); State \r\n  v. Cabbagestalk, 281 S.C. 35, 314 S.E.2d 10 (1984). \r\n  \r\nThe trial court may order the sequestration \r\n  of witnesses upon its own motion or by motion of any party. Rule 615, SCRE. \r\n  A party is not entitled to have witnesses sequestered as a matter of right. \r\n  The decision to sequester witnesses is left to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge. State v. Sullivan, 277 \r\n  S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981); State \r\n  v. Harris, 275 S.C. 463, 272 S.E.2d 636 (1980); State \r\n  v. LaBarge, 275 S.C. 168, 268 S.E.2d 278 (1980); State \r\n  v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 509 S.E.2d 827 (Ct. App. 1998) (allowing the \r\n  State to recall a reply witness who was present in the courtroom during a portion \r\n  of the trial). \"Whether a witness should be exempted from a sequestration order \r\n  is within the trial court's discretion.\" Gattison \r\n  v. South Carolina State College, 318 S.C. 148, 456 S.E.2d 414, 415 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995) (citing Constant v. Spartanburg \r\n  Steel Prods. Inc., 316 S.C. 86, 447 S.E.2d 194 (1994)).\r\n  \r\nDavid Rykowski, a former sales manager \r\n  at \"Your Car Store,\" was scheduled to testify that he sold a brown Cadillac \r\n  to Tisdale fourteen days before the bank robbery. Tisdale's brown Cadillac with \r\n  the yellow \"Your Car Store\" license tag had been identified previously as the \r\n  car in the alley behind the bank near the time of the robbery. At trial, Tisdale \r\n  moved to sequester all the State's witnesses. The trial judge granted the motion \r\n  with the exception of two law enforcement officers who were allowed to remain \r\n  in the courtroom. Rykowski was not sequestered during opening arguments. \r\n  \r\nDuring Rykowski's direct examination, \r\n  the following exchange occurred:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  When Mr. Tisdale came in to purchase \r\n    the car, do you recall any articles of clothing that he was wearing at the \r\n    time?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n[Tisdale's counsel objects and the \r\n  trial court overrules the objection]\r\nI do remember it was a - - I don't \r\n  know what type of clothing it was, but I do remember a Miami Hurricanes orange \r\n  and green sweat shirt, jacket, you know. What it was, I don't know, but I do \r\n  remember the emblem. \r\n\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe solicitor showed Rykowski one \r\n  of the pictures taken from the videotape of the robbery and asked if the outerwear \r\n  worn by the robber in the picture was similar to the jacket Tisdale wore when \r\n  buying the car. Rykowski agreed that the emblem on the robber's jacket was like \r\n  the emblem on Tisdale's outerwear the day Tisdale bought the car. On cross-examination, \r\n  Rykowski admitted that he did not remember Tisdale's distinctive outerwear until \r\n  it was mentioned in the opening arguments.\r\n  \r\nAfter Rykowski testified and outside \r\n  the jury's presence, Tisdale's counsel noted [b]efore \r\n  Mr. Rykowski testified, one thing we had not been made aware of and I guess \r\n  Mr. Rykowski did not know was about his testimony about the Miami Hurricanes \r\n  outfit, we thought he was subject to the sequestration order, apparently, the \r\n  opening argument jarred some sort of dormant memory that he had about Mr. Tisdale's \r\n  clothing.\r\n  \r\nI approached the bench before his \r\n  testimony to say we object to that as being information in violation, essentially, \r\n  of the sequestration order.\r\n  \r\nMy understanding at that time you \r\n  [sic] were going to allow it to come in and we noted the objection when he testified \r\n  to that part of it and I think that clears it up.\r\n  \r\nThe trial court responded that it \r\n  was not going to \"step in and take that drastic of action [sic] unless there \r\n  was a flagrant, intentional, violation of sequestration and obviously that was \r\n  not the case.\"\r\n  \r\nThe trial court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion in refusing Tisdale's motion for mistrial. \"The granting of a motion \r\n  for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident \r\n  is so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.\" State \r\n  v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999)(citing State \r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998)). Rykowski's testimony corroborated \r\n  Vannice and Crawford's identifications and helped establish Tisdale as the person \r\n  in the bank's surveillance video. However, Tisdale was not entitled to Rykowski's \r\n  sequestration as a matter of law. Furthermore, Tisdale's counsel cross-examined \r\n  Rykowski concerning the fact that he did not remember Tisdale's Miami Hurricanes \r\n  outerwear until after he had heard opening arguments. Although the contested \r\n  portion of Rykowski's testimony strengthened the State's case, the fact that \r\n  he did not remember the distinctive Miami Hurricanes outerwear until opening \r\n  arguments affected Rykowski's credibility and the weight of his testimony. The \r\n  weight a witness's testimony should be given and the assessment of a witness's \r\n  credibility is the province of the jury. Johnson \r\n  v. Painter, 279 S.C. 390, 307 S.E.2d 860 (1983); Hill \r\n  v. Polar Pantries, 219 S.C. 263, 64 S.E.2d 885 (1951); Hutson \r\n  v. Cummins Carolinas, Inc., 280 S.C. 552, 314 S.E.2d 19 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\n  We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tisdale's motion \r\n  for mistrial.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nBecause there was no governmental \r\n  involvement in the suggestive identification in this case, the trial court did \r\n  not abuse its discretion in allowing the tellers' in-court identification testimony. \r\n  Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tisdale's \r\n  motion for a mistrial. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCURETON, HEARN and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n1. The \r\n  television news report was filmed at Tisdale's post-arrest bond hearing.  \r\n   \r\n2. The \r\n  photograph of Tisdale was a \"mug shot\" taken after a previous arrest for drug \r\n  possession in 1995.   \r\n\r\n3.  On appeal, \r\n  Tisdale objects to the police's use of a photographic show-up rather than a \r\n  nonsuggestive line-up after the media identification. The photographic show-up \r\n  may have been suggestive. See \r\n  Simmons, 390 U.S. at 383 (identifications \r\n  arising from single photo displays are generally viewed with suspicion). Furthermore, \r\n  the use of a nonsuggestive line-up \"would have enhanced the force of the identification \r\n  at trial and would have avoided the risk that the evidence would be excluded \r\n  as unreliable.\" Manson, 432 \r\n  U.S. at 117. However, we need not address whether the in-court identifications \r\n  were impermissibly tainted by the police photographic show-up because the objection \r\n  was not raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court. See \r\n  State v. Williams, 303 S.C. \r\n  410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991) (issue must be raised to and ruled on by the trial \r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review); State \r\n  v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994) (an issue which is not \r\n  properly preserved cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3109","title":"S.C.

We reverse.\r\n  \r\nJamie Doe (the child) was born on \r\n  March 26, 1985, in Conway, South Carolina. DSS took the child into protective \r\n  custody in September 1992, due to allegations of physical and medical neglect. \r\n  The child was placed in her current foster/pre-adoptive home in 1993. On March \r\n  23, 1993, the child's biological mother executed a Consent and Relinquishment \r\n  for Adoption granting legal custody of the child to DSS. On the same date, the \r\n  biological mother signed an affidavit naming an individual (hereinafter referred \r\n  to as J.T.) as the child's biological father. By order dated February 13, 1996, \r\n  the family court terminated J.T.'s parental rights to the child. \r\n  \r\nOn July 2, 1996, the child's foster \r\n  mother instituted an action seeking to adopt the child. The family court appointed \r\n  a guardian ad litem to represent the child. In May of 1997, the guardian ad \r\n  litem wrote to DSS requesting the name and last known address of the biological \r\n  mother in order to include her name in the service by publication to John Doe, \r\n  a putative/unknown father. DSS responded by letter denying the request and stating \r\n  that the name of the biological mother was confidential pursuant to relevant \r\n  case and statutory law. \r\n  \r\nAt a July 1997 status hearing, the \r\n  parties agreed that even though the biological mother had named J.T. as the \r\n  child's biological father, a John Doe notice should be published so as to terminate \r\n  the parental rights of any putative father. However, the parties disagreed as \r\n  to whether the biological mother's name should be included in the publication. \r\n  The guardian ad litem took the position that inclusion of the biological mother's \r\n  name in the publication was necessary to properly notify John Doe of the adoption \r\n  proceedings. DSS contended publication of the biological mother's name would \r\n  violate her right to privacy. In August 1997, the guardian ad litem filed a \r\n  motion for an order of publication for service upon John Doe, with such publication \r\n  to include the name of the biological mother. By order dated October 23, 1997, \r\n  the family court denied the guardian's motion to include the biological mother's \r\n  name in the John Doe publication, but nonetheless ordered DSS to expeditiously \r\n  proceed with terminating John Doe's parental rights to the child.\r\n  \r\nIn compliance with the family court's \r\n  order, DSS filed an action against John Doe seeking termination of his parental \r\n  rights. In connection with the action, DSS served John Doe through publication \r\n  in a newspaper of general circulation. The mother's name was not included in \r\n  the publication. At the TPR hearing in May of 1998, a different family court \r\n  judge heard arguments regarding whether the publication constituted sufficient \r\n  notice to John Doe given the absence of the biological mother's name. The family \r\n  court found the publication was ineffective and ordered DSS to republish the \r\n  notice with the biological mother's name included therein. \r\n  (1) The family court denied DSS's motion for reconsideration. This \r\n  interlocutory appeal followed.\r\n  \r\nOn \r\n  appeal, DSS argues the family court erred in requiring the inclusion of the \r\n  biological mother's name in the John Doe notice by publication. We agree.\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  right of adoption in South Carolina is not a natural right but wholly statutory, \r\n  and must be strictly construed. Hucks \r\n  v. Dolan, 288 S.C. 468, 343 S.E.2d 613 (1986). As noted by our Supreme \r\n  Court in Bradey v. Children's Bureau \r\n  of South Carolina, 275 S.C. 622, 626, 274 S.E.2d 418, 420 (1981), our \r\n  adoption statutes \"are designed to promote policies and procedures necessary \r\n  for the protection of all the parties involved in an adoption.\" \r\n  \r\nTwo \r\n  areas of particular concern in the adoption arena are the right to notification \r\n  and the right to privacy. South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1734(B)(Supp. 1998) \r\n  provides that even where a father's consent or relinquishment is not required \r\n  for purposes of adoption pursuant to Â§ 20-7-1690, he is nonetheless entitled \r\n  to notice of adoption proceedings. South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(C)(Supp. \r\n  1998) provides:\r\n  \r\nAll \r\n  files and records pertaining to the adoption proceedings in the State Department \r\n  of Social Services, or in any authorized agency, or maintained by any person \r\n  certified by the department under the provisions of Section 20-7-1750, are confidential \r\n  and must be withheld from inspection except upon court order for good cause \r\n  shown. \r\n  \r\nHere, \r\n  our concern is not whether John Doe is entitled to notice of the adoption proceedings, \r\n  but to what notice he is entitled. More particularly, we must determine whether, \r\n  under the facts and circumstances of this case, notice by publication to a putative \r\n  father of adoption proceedings must include the name of the biological mother.\r\nWhile \r\n  the particular facts now before us present an issue of first impression, prior \r\n  cases dealing with similar issues provide guidance as to whether the need to \r\n  notify John Doe of the adoption proceedings constitutes \"good cause\" for disclosure \r\n  of the biological mother's identity. In determining whether \"good cause\" has \r\n  been established warranting the release of the confidential biological information, \r\n  the court must apply a balancing test, weighing the respective interests of \r\n  the parties to the adoption action, including those of the adoptee, the adoptive \r\n  parents, and the biological parents. Further, beyond the impact on the parties, \r\n  the court must give due consideration to the impact that each case may have \r\n  on the viability of the adoption process. Bradey, \r\n  supra. In applying this balancing \r\n  test,\r\n  \r\n[W]e \r\n  must be mindful of the rationale for confidentiality in the adoption process. \r\n  Not only does confidentiality insulate and nurture the newly formed adoptive \r\n  family, it also may be assumed to provide the impetus for a traumatized natural \r\n  parent to come forward to allow the process to take place rather than resort \r\n  to other less desirable means of dealing with prospective parenthood, The natural \r\n  parent or parents must feel secure in the knowledge that their identity will \r\n  usually remain confidential. This offers the parent a fresh start, confident \r\n  that the personal information will be disclosed only for good cause on order \r\n  of the court. This expectation of confidentiality arising from the statute is \r\n  constitutionally protected as a right of privacy.\r\n  \r\nId. \r\n  at 626-627, 274 S.E.2d at 421(citations omitted).\r\n  \r\nTo \r\n  establish good cause within the meaning of Â§ 20-7-1780, a party must demonstrate \r\n  a compelling need for the identifying information which outweighs the need for \r\n  confidentiality. Id. at 627, \r\n  274 S.E.2d at 421. What constitutes a compelling need for identification depends \r\n  upon the circumstances of each case. Id. \r\n  \"Disclosure follows in extraordinary circumstances.\" Id. \r\n  at 629, 274 S.E.2d at 422. \r\n  \r\nWe \r\n  hold the guardian ad litem has failed to demonstrate a compelling need for the \r\n  identifying information. The biological mother has identified an individual \r\n  as the biological father in a signed affidavit and his parental rights have \r\n  been terminated. Thus, notification to John Doe is precautionary in nature and \r\n  based on the mere possibility that either the biological mother has been less \r\n  than candid about the identity of the child's father, or she does not know the \r\n  father's identity. In our view, these circumstances do not constitute good cause \r\n  to subject the biological mother to the public scrutiny which would necessarily \r\n  enure from publication of her name in connection with these proceedings. While \r\n  the privacy rights of biological parents in adoption proceedings are not absolute, \r\n  we believe disclosure of the mother's identity in this case would undermine \r\n  the expectation that confidentiality will be maintained in adoption proceedings \r\n  except under the most extraordinary circumstances. Id.\r\n  \r\nFurther, \r\n  the mere existence of a biological link does not merit constitutional protection \r\n  of due process rights. Evans v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. 303 S.C. 108, 399 S.E.2d 156 (1990). In \r\n  Evans, our Supreme Court held, \r\n  where a father's consent is not needed for an adoption, the father's due process \r\n  rights are not violated by publishing a \"John Doe\" notice, when the identity \r\n  of the father is unknown because the mother refuses to reveal it. The court \r\n  in Evans further held the family \r\n  court erred in ordering DSS to divulge the name and address of the birth mother \r\n  in order to ascertain the identity of the birth father, where the birth mother \r\n  had refused to divulge the birth father's identity to DSS. The court found that \r\n  to compel DSS \"to reveal the birth mother's name and address would undermine \r\n  the confidentiality that is the foundation of the adoption process and would \r\n  violate the mother's right to privacy.\" Id. \r\n  at 110, 399 S.E.2d at 157. Clearly, if DSS was not required to divulge the birth \r\n  mother's name merely for purposes of ascertaining the birth father's name in \r\n  the Evans case, DSS should not \r\n  be compelled to divulge the birth mother's name in the instant case, where the \r\n  purpose was to actually publish her name in the John Doe notice, a much greater \r\n  infringement on her right to privacy.\r\n  \r\nFor \r\n  the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is \r\n  \r\nREVERSED.\r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY \r\n  and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  \r\n  While this appears to be a case of one family court judge impermissibly overruling \r\n  another, DSS does not seek reversal on this ground on appeal. See \r\n  Charleston County DSS v. Father, \r\n  317 S.C. 283, 454 S.E.2d 307 (1995) \r\n  (one judge may not overrule another judge \r\n  of the same court); see also \r\n  In the Interest of Antonio H., \r\n  324 S.C. 120, 477 S.E.2d 713 (1996) (appellate court may not address issue which \r\n  was not presented to it); Connolly \r\n  v.

The trial court found the rule \r\n  was applicable. We affirm.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    FACTS\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nSheila Graham was allegedly struck \r\n  by a Dorchester County school bus. In October of 1991, she filed suit against \r\n  the Dorchester County School District. The complaint was later amended to add \r\n  the South Carolina Department of Education as a defendant. \r\n  \r\nOn April 30, 1993, the trial court \r\n  struck the case from the trial roster with leave to restore, pursuant to former \r\n  Rule 40(c)(3), SCRCP. However, effective January 1, 1995, Rule 40(c)(3) was \r\n  amended and replaced by Rule 40(j), SCRCP, which provided a new procedure for \r\n  dismissing and restoring cases. \r\n  \r\nAn \"Order to Restore,\" dated April \r\n  30, 1998, placed Graham's case back on the active roster. The School District \r\n  moved to dismiss the case with prejudice, alleging the case had not been restored \r\n  \"within 1 year of the date stricken\" as required by Rule 40(j). \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge dismissed Graham's \r\n  case with prejudice. He concluded, as a rule of civil procedure, Rule 40(j) \r\n  should be given retroactive application to cases pending at the time of its \r\n  enactment. The court observed that Rule 40(j), which became effective on January \r\n  1, 1995, required that a party make a motion to restore a case within a year \r\n  after it had been stricken. The court then held: \"Giving the plaintiff the benefit \r\n  of all doubt the motion to restore should have been noticed at least 10 days \r\n  prior to January 1, 1996.\" It concluded Graham's motion to restore, made more \r\n  than two years after the time allowed by Rule 40(j), was not a timely restoration. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nPrior to its amendment, former Rule \r\n  40(c)(3), SCRCP, provided as follows:\r\n  \r\n(3) Actions Called for Trial. \r\n  When an action is reached on the trial roster and is called for trial, it shall \r\n  not be continued by consent, and if counsel are not ready to go forward the \r\n  court shall strike the action from the calendar (file book) with leave to restore, \r\n  unless continuance is granted for good cause shown. If the case is restored \r\n  after being stricken, it shall be placed at the foot of the calendar (file book) \r\n  and a new case number assigned.\r\n  \r\nRule 40(c)(3), SCRCP (amended Jan. \r\n  1, 1995).\r\n  \r\nRule 40(j), SCRCP, effective January \r\n  1, 1995, substantially revised the former rule, and now provides:\r\n  \r\n(j) Case Stricken From Docket \r\n  by Agreement. A party may strike its complaint, counterclaim, \r\n  cross-claim or third party claim from any docket one time as a matter of right, \r\n  provided that all parties adverse to that claim, counterclaim, cross-claim \r\n  or third party claim agree in writing that it may be stricken, and all further \r\n  agree that if the claim is restored upon motion made within 1 year of the date \r\n  stricken, the statute of limitations shall be tolled as to all consenting parties \r\n  during the time the case is stricken, and any unexpired portion of the \r\n  statute of limitations on the date the case was stricken shall remain and begin \r\n  to run on the date that the claim is restored. A party moving to restore \r\n  a case stricken from the docket shall provide all parties notice of the \r\n  motion to restore at least 10 days before it is heard. Upon being restored, \r\n  the case shall be placed on the General Docket and proceed from that date as \r\n  provided in this rule.\r\n  \r\nRule 40(j), SCRCP (emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nIn cases dealing with statutory law \r\n  changes, courts have discussed the general rules of prospective and retroactive \r\n  application. By analogy, those same principles can be applied to determine whether \r\n  an amended procedural rule should have prospective or retroactive effect. See \r\n  generally Valentine \r\n  v. Davis, 319 S.C. 169, 173, 460 S.E.2d 218, 220 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"[T]he \r\n  rules of procedure, like statutes, should be given their plain meaning.\").\r\n  \r\nOur Supreme Court has held that statutes \r\n  are presumed to be entitled to prospective construction unless there is an express \r\n  provision or a clear legislative intent to the contrary. Hercules \r\n  Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137, 262 S.E.2d 45 (1980) \r\n  (holding a statute which has the effect of tolling a statute of limitations \r\n  affects the remedy and not the right and is therefore subject to retroactive \r\n  application). A principal exception is remedial or procedural statutes are generally \r\n  held to operate retrospectively. Id.; \r\n  see Jenkins \r\n  v. Meares, 302 S.C. 142, 146, 394 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1990) (\"Our decisions \r\n  recognize a presumption that statutory enactments are to be given prospective \r\n  rather than retroactive effect. An exception to this presumption arises when \r\n  the enactment is remedial or procedural in nature, such as a statute of limitations.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure provide that the rules, which initially took effect on July 1, 1985, \r\n  would \"govern all proceedings in civil actions brought after they take effect.\" \r\n  Rule 86(a), SCRCP. Moreover, the rules also govern \"all further proceedings \r\n  in actions then pending\" unless to do so \"would not be feasible or would work \r\n  injustice.\" Id.; see \r\n  McGann v. Mungo, 287 S.C. 561, \r\n  340 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding the new rules of civil procedure apply \r\n  to all further proceedings in pending actions); James F. Flanagan, South \r\n  Carolina Civil Procedure 583 (2d ed. 1996) (\"Rule 86(a) made these rules \r\n  applicable to cases then pending at the time of [sic] rules were adopted. A \r\n  similar result follows when new civil rules are promulgated.\").\r\nGraham originally filed her case \r\n  in 1991. It was stricken from the trial roster in 1993. She did not move to \r\n  restore it until five years later. By then, Rule 40(j) had been in effect for \r\n  over three years. Rule 40(j) required motions to restore be made within one \r\n  year of the case being stricken to take advantage of the tolling of the statute \r\n  of limitations. (1) In Graham's case, the one \r\n  year period should have begun to run upon the adoption of Rule 40(j). Therefore, \r\n  the motion to restore should have been filed at least 10 days prior to January \r\n  1, 1996.\r\n  \r\nThe one year period provided for \r\n  in Rule 40(j) constituted a reasonable time for Graham to move to restore her \r\n  case to the active roster. The retroactive application of this procedural rule, \r\n  did not deprive Graham of an opportunity to proceed with her case. Retroactive \r\n  application of Rule 40(j) is \"feasible\" and will not \"work injustice\" given \r\n  the circumstances of this case. See \r\n  Rule 86(a), SCRCP.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court dismissing Graham's action with prejudice for failure to \r\n  timely move to restore her case is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  Because the \r\n  statute of limitations clearly expired on Graham's cause of action, the tolling \r\n  aspect of Rule 40(j) is not an issue in this case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3111","title":"State v.

Taylor appeals, arguing his conviction is invalid as a matter \r\n  of law because the term of his suspension expired before the date of his arrest. \r\n  We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  1996, Daniel Lee Taylor was charged with and convicted of driving under suspension \r\n  (DUS). As a result, his license was suspended. The suspension period ended November \r\n  1, 1996. It is undisputed that Taylor never complied with the statutory requirements \r\n  for reinstating his suspended license. In January of 1998, Taylor was stopped \r\n  and arrested for driving on the wrong side of the road. A Beaufort County grand \r\n  jury indicted him for DUS. \r\n  \r\nAt \r\n  a bench trial, Taylor stipulated to the facts. The only matter the judge had \r\n  to decide, therefore, was Taylor's claim that, because his license suspension \r\n  expired in November 1996, he could not, as a matter of law, be convicted of \r\n  DUS in 1998. The trial court found Taylor guilty of DUS, second offense, and \r\n  sentenced him to sixty days imprisonment and a $500 fine, suspended on fifty-nine \r\n  days or a $350 fine and two years probation. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  sole question presented for our consideration is whether the running of a definite \r\n  term of suspension precludes a conviction for DUS as a matter of law. \r\n  (1) Taylor contends the expiration of his suspension period effectively \r\n  operated to \"revoke\" his driver's license, because by statute he was required \r\n  to \"renew\" his license before driving again. As he admittedly failed to comply \r\n  with the statutory requirements, asserts Taylor, he actually did not possess \r\n  a license at the time of the arrest and therefore could not be convicted of \r\n  DUS. \r\n  \r\nOne \r\n  statute at issue provides in relevant part:\r\n  \r\n[I]n \r\n  all cases where the Department [of Public Safety] suspends or revokes the driver's \r\n  license of any person under lawful authority possessed by the Department, \r\n  except in those cases provided for in Â§ 56-1-270, in which case the license \r\n  only shall be suspended and not the registration, the Department shall also \r\n  suspend the registration for all motor vehicles registered in the name of that \r\n  person . . . . The license and registration shall remain suspended \r\n  or revoked and shall not at any time thereafter be renewed nor shall any license \r\n  be thereafter issued to that person . . . until permitted under the motor vehicle \r\n  laws of this State and not then until he shall give and thereafter maintain \r\n  proof of financial responsibility. \r\n  \r\nS.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-500 (1991) (emphasis added). Accordingly, by the clear, express \r\n  terms of the statute, once Taylor's license was suspended lawfully, it remained \r\n  suspended in the absence of proof of financial responsibility. See \r\n  Bumgardner v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 286 S.C. 46, 331 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. \r\n  1985) (on completion of DUS suspension period, Â§ 56-9-500 requires submission \r\n  of proof of financial responsibility before reinstating driver's license) \r\n  (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nTaylor, \r\n  however, argues that because his definite period of suspension expired on November \r\n  1, 1996, his failure to conform to the statutory mandates of Â§Â§ 56-1-400 and \r\n  56-9-500 caused his license to expire with it. Therefore, although he may have \r\n  been driving without a license, he was not driving under suspension. In support \r\n  of this argument, Taylor relies on Â§ 56-1-400, which states in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  department, upon suspending or revoking a license, shall require that such license \r\n  shall be surrendered to the department. At the end of the period of suspension, \r\n  other than suspension for reckless driving, driving under the influence of intoxicants \r\n  or pursuant to the point system such license so surrendered shall be returned \r\n  to the licensee, or in the discretion of the department, a new license issued \r\n  to him. The department shall not return nor restore \r\n  a license which has been suspended for reckless driving, driving under the influence \r\n  of intoxicants, or for violations under the point system until the person has \r\n  filed an application for a new license, submitted to an examination as upon \r\n  an original application, and has satisfied the department, after an investigation \r\n  of the character, habits, and driving ability of the person, that it would be \r\n  safe to grant him the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-400 (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). By requiring a new application \r\n  and \"examination as upon an original application,\" argues Taylor, the statute \r\n  makes the de facto assumption that a person whose license was suspended for \r\n  one of the three offenses named therein did not have a license at all and therefore \r\n  was required to apply for a \"new\" one. \r\n  \r\nHowever, \r\n  this interpretation not only conflicts directly with Â§ 56-9-500, it ignores \r\n  the very language of the statute it claims as support. As stated above, Â§ 56-1-400 \r\n  provides that the Department of Public Safety shall not return or restore \r\n  a license suspended for any of these three offenses. Obviously, there has to \r\n  be an extant license for the Department to return or restore. See \r\n  City of Columbia v. American Civil \r\n  Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996) (where \r\n  language of statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite \r\n  meaning, there is no occasion to employ rules of statutory interpretation and \r\n  court must apply terms according to their literal meaning); City \r\n  of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d 492 (Ct. App. 1997) (where \r\n  the legislature elects not to define a statutory term, court will interpret \r\n  it in accord with its usual and customary meaning). \r\n  \r\nMoreover, \r\n  such a reading misapprehends the rationale behind a definite term of suspension. \r\n  The statute envisions that at the end of a period of suspension, a person may \r\n  reacquire his driving privilege, either by having his license returned or reissued \r\n  automatically under Â§ 56-1-400, or by having it restored by complying with the \r\n  statutory provisions of Â§Â§ 56-1-400 and 56-9-500. Additionally, consistent with \r\n  the procedures outlined above, Â§ 56-1-390(1) provides, \"Whenever the department \r\n  suspends or revokes the license of a person under its lawful authority, the \r\n  license remains suspended or revoked and must not be reinstated \r\n  or renewed nor may another license be issued to that person until he also \r\n  remits to the department a reinstatement fee . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  56-1-390(1) (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). When these statutory provisions are \r\n  read together, it is clear the legislature intended that once a license is suspended, \r\n  it remains suspended until these requirements have been met.\r\n  \r\nFor \r\n  the foregoing reasons, Taylor's conviction for driving under suspension is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nANDERSON \r\n  and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  \r\n  As an initial matter, the State claims this issue is not preserved for appellate \r\n  review because Taylor failed to move for a directed verdict at trial. The record \r\n  on appeal clearly demonstrates this issue was the only one argued to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court. Indeed, it was the very reason for the \"stipulated \r\n  fact bench trial.\" See Hubbard \r\n  v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 19, 5 S.E.2d 187, 189 (1939) (\"[A]ll that this \r\n  Court has ever required is that the questions presented for its decision must \r\n  first have been fairly and properly raised in the lower Court and passed upon \r\n  by that Court.\"). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3112","title":"Anderson v.

We affirm \r\n  the appealed order, but remand for a subject matter jurisdiction hearing.\r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nIn 1985, Anderson received a life \r\n  sentence upon conviction for murder in York County. He then unsuccessfully pursued \r\n  two applications for post-conviction relief, a belated direct appeal, and a \r\n  federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus. \r\n  \r\nAnderson then filed a petition for \r\n  a writ of mandamus, asking the circuit court to order the York County Clerk \r\n  of Court to provide him copies of (1) the grand jury transcripts involving his \r\n  indictment, (2) a list of the grand jurors who considered his indictment, and \r\n  (3) documentary proof that the grand jury was qualified by a circuit judge in \r\n  open court. The circuit court dismissed Anderson's petition, noting the \"York \r\n  County Clerk of Court is under no duty to produce these documents and [Anderson] \r\n  has no specific legal right to them because they are all secret.\" Anderson filed \r\n  a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied. Anderson then filed this \r\n  appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I. \r\n    Writ of Mandamus\r\n  Anderson argues the \r\n    trial court erred in denying his petition for a writ of mandamus for production \r\n    of the proceedings of the grand jury that indicted him. We disagree.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"The primary purpose of a writ of \r\n  mandamus is to enforce an established right and to enforce a corresponding imperative \r\n  duty created or imposed by law.\" Porter \r\n  v. Jedziniak, 334 S.C. 16, 18, 512 S.E.2d 497, 497 (1999). A petitioner \r\n  seeking a writ of mandamus to require the performance of an act \"must show (1) \r\n  a duty of respondent to perform the act, (2) the ministerial nature of the act, \r\n  (3) the petitioner's specific legal right for which discharge of the duty is \r\n  necessary, and (4) a lack of any other legal remedy.\" Id. \r\n  at 18, 512 S.E.2d at 498.\r\n  \r\nWe hold the circuit court properly \r\n  dismissed Anderson's petition because Anderson possesses no specific legal right \r\n  to the requested information and the clerk of court has no duty to provide it. \r\n  Granting Anderson's request for the grand jury transcripts involving his case \r\n  would violate this state's long held policy that \"[i]nvestigations and deliberations \r\n  of a grand jury are conducted in secret and are, as a rule, legally sealed against \r\n  divulgence.\" State v. Whitted, \r\n  279 S.C. 260, 262, 305 S.E.2d 245, 246 (1983), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by State v. \r\n  Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d 202 (1998); see \r\n  also Ex parte McLeod: In Re \r\n  Cannon, 272 S.C. 373, 252 S.E.2d 126 (1979); State \r\n  v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 155 S.E. 385 (1930). \r\n  \r\nII. Subject \r\n  Matter Jurisdiction Hearing\r\n  \r\nIn addition to his argument regarding \r\n  his petition for a writ of mandamus, Anderson requests a hearing to determine \r\n  whether the court which tried him for murder was vested with subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction. He cites the absence of the term \"true bill\" on the face of the \r\n  indictment against him as grounds for the hearing. We find his request proper, \r\n  and accordingly remand. \r\n The \r\n  State argues this issue is not preserved because Anderson did not raise the \r\n  issue to the circuit court in his mandamus petition. However, subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction may be raised at any time. State \r\n  v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1998). Thus, Anderson's \r\n  failure to raise the issue prior to this appeal does not preclude our consideration \r\n  of it. \r\n   \r\n\"No person may be held to answer \r\n  for any crime . . . unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury of \r\n  the county where the crime has been committed.\" S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11. The \r\n  law requires presentment of a grand jury as a condition precedent to the trial \r\n  of a crime, excepting certain minor offenses. State \r\n  v. Beachum, 288 S.C. 325, 342 S.E.2d 597 (1986). A conviction obtained \r\n  without the presentment of a grand jury will be voided on appeal. State \r\n  v. Hann, 196 S.C. 211, 12 S.E.2d 720 (1940). However, a facial irregularity \r\n  does not render an indictment invalid \"where the indictment is in writing and \r\n  published by the clerk.\" State v. Bultron, \r\n  318 S.C. 323, 329, 457 S.E.2d 616, 619 (Ct. App. 1995). Furthermore, the regularity \r\n  of proceedings in a court of general jurisdiction \"will be assumed\" absent evidence \r\n  to the contrary. Pringle v. State, \r\n  287 S.C. 409, 410-11, 339 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1986).\r\n  \r\nIn State \r\n  v. Bultron, this court considered a conviction based on an indictment \r\n  which was \"signed by the grand jury foreman but was not stamped or otherwise \r\n  marked as a 'true bill' or a 'no bill.'\" Bultron, \r\n  318 S.C. at 328, 457 S.E.2d at 619. The trial court held a hearing on the defendant's \r\n  motion to quash the indictment because of this defect. At the hearing, the State \r\n  produced testimony from the grand jury's docket coordinator that during the \r\n  term in question, the grand jury considered and acted on all indictments presented \r\n  and returned no \"no bills.\" Because of this evidence that the grand jury had \r\n  in fact \"true billed\" the indictment, this court agreed with the trial court's \r\n  assessment that the lack of a \"true bill\" stamp was merely a scrivener's error \r\n  and found the conviction was obtained with subject matter jurisdiction. Bultron, \r\n  318 S.C. at 329-330, 457 S.E.2d at 620.\r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, the grand jury \r\n  foreman signed and dated the murder indictment against Anderson. However, though \r\n  this certainly suggests the grand jury deliberated and reached a decision on \r\n  the indictment, the document bears no indications of whether the grand jury \r\n  \"true billed\" or \"no billed\" it. Nor do we have any additional evidence before \r\n  us, as did the court in Bultron, \r\n  as to what action the grand jury took. We therefore remand the case for a hearing \r\n  on whether the trial court was properly vested with subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  during Anderson's murder trial. At the hearing, the State shall bear the burden \r\n  of proving subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nAccordingly, the appealed order is \r\n  affirmed and the case is remanded for a subject matter jurisdiction hearing.\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\r\n  \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3113","title":"Lawson v.

Mr. Lawson was shot by a Sumter County \r\n  sheriff's deputy, who was injured trying to effect Mr. Lawson's arrest. The \r\n  deputy, in turn, filed suit for his injuries against Mrs. Lawson as the personal \r\n  representative of her husband's estate, and she counterclaimed for violations \r\n  of 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983. The parties entered a settlement, which included a provision \r\n  for attorney's fees equal to 40% of the settlement. Mrs. Lawson, on behalf of \r\n  her attorney, subsequently petitioned for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988. \r\n  The Sheriff's Office and Thames in turn moved for attorney's fees and costs \r\n  incurred in responding to the petition. The trial court denied the request for \r\n  additional attorney's fees, finding the previous settlement conclusive of the \r\n  matter. He further denied the Sheriff's Office's and Thames' request for fees \r\n  and costs. Mrs. Lawson as well as the Sheriff's Office and Thames appeal. We \r\n  affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nOn January 22, 1996, the decedent, \r\n  Mr. Lawson, was stopped by a deputy with the Sumter County Sheriff's Office \r\n  and charged with speeding, open container violation, threatening the life of \r\n  an officer, and carrying a concealed weapon. Thereafter, Lawson applied for \r\n  pretrial intervention on certain of the charges. Lawson was apparently tried \r\n  in his absence on some of the charges and was found guilty. \r\n  \r\nSubsequently, on February 26, 1996, \r\n  Mr. Lawson was stopped by Harold V. Thames, a deputy with the Sumter County \r\n  Sheriff's Office, who attempted to serve a warrant on Lawson. When Officer Thames \r\n  attempted an arrest, Mr. Lawson tried to escape in his vehicle. Officer Thames \r\n  became entangled in the open window of Mr. Lawson's moving vehicle. When Mr. \r\n  Lawson purportedly refused to stop the vehicle or allow Officer Thames to disembark, \r\n  Thames shot him, resulting in his death. Mrs. Lawson, as personal representative \r\n  of her husband's estate, filed an action on March 25, 1996, against the Sumter \r\n  County Sheriff's Office, asserting claims under the South Carolina Tort Claims \r\n  Act. Officer Thames subsequently sued Mr. Lawson's estate for the \r\n  injuries he received in the accident. Mrs. Lawson counterclaimed, raising claims \r\n  under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983. \r\n  \r\nMrs. Lawson reached a settlement \r\n  on all claims with the Sumter County Sheriff's Office and Officer Thames for \r\n  $125,000. Of this amount, $115,000 was allocated to a wrongful death cause of \r\n  action, and $10,000 for a survival claim and \"any and all other claims of this \r\n  estate arising from this accident.\" The settlement was approved by circuit court \r\n  order dated October 7, 1997. The order provided that in accordance with the \r\n  agreement of the parties, Mrs. Lawson's attorney, Edward M. Brown, was to receive \r\n  40% of the settlement amount as payment of attorney's fees. That same day, Mrs. \r\n  Lawson executed a \"RELEASE\" which released the Sumter County Sheriff's Office \r\n  and Thames from \"all claims made or that could be made by the undersigned\" arising \r\n  from the incident. Lawson received payment in accordance with the settlement \r\n  and order approving the settlement. \r\n  \r\nAlthough Brown was paid the $50,000 \r\n  in fees pursuant to the settlement, in November 1997 he filed a petition for \r\n  attorney's fees in connection with this action. In the petition, Brown asked \r\n  for attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1988 in the amount of $120,006.25, \r\n  for 685.75 hours at $175 per hour. Officer Thames and the Sheriff's Office opposed \r\n  the petition and moved for attorney's fees and sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP \r\n  on the basis Brown's petition was \"frivolous.\" \r\n  \r\nSubsequent to the hearing on the \r\n  petition, Brown submitted a document dated November 19, 1996 signed by Mrs. \r\n  Lawson which purportedly assigned to him any right to attorney's fees under \r\n  Â§ 1988. On December 10, 1997, the trial court issued its order denying the petition \r\n  for additional attorney's fees, finding the issue was disposed of in the October \r\n  7, 1997 order putting into effect the settlement of the parties. The court noted \r\n  the settlement disposed of all claims between the parties and authorized Mrs. \r\n  Lawson to pay Brown from the gross proceeds of the settlement. The court stated \r\n  if the parties had intended to reserve the issue of additional attorney's fees, \r\n  \"such intention should have been disclosed at the hearing [on the petition for \r\n  settlement].\" \r\n  \r\nThe trial court subsequently granted \r\n  the Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion of the Sheriff's Office and Thames to amend the \r\n  order denying additional attorney's fees so as \r\n  to clarify that the \"denial is as to both [Mrs. Lawson and her] attorney, Edward \r\n  M. Brown, Esq., in his capacity as attorney for the Estate in this matter and \r\n  individually under any note or assignment executed by the Personal Representative \r\n  for the Estate for said fees.\" \r\n  (1) The court also denied the request by Thames and the Sheriff's \r\n  Office for Rule 11 sanctions and attorney's fees to be assessed against Brown. \r\n  Mrs. Lawson appeals the denial of attorney's fees. The Sheriff's Office and \r\n  Thames also appeal, asserting the trial court should have granted their motion \r\n  for attorney's fees and sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP on the basis the petition \r\n  for attorney's fees above and beyond the amount provided in the settlement was \r\n  frivolous.\r\n  \r\nA. \r\n  Appeal of Mrs. Lawson\r\n  \r\nMrs. \r\n  Lawson asserts the trial court erred in denying the petition for attorneys fees \r\n  under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1988. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nSection \r\n  1983 allows recovery for the deprivation of civil rights as follows:\r\n  \r\nEvery \r\n  person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, \r\n  of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \r\n  be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction \r\n  thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured \r\n  by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action \r\n  at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\r\n  \r\n42 \r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1983.\r\n  \r\nSection \r\n  1988 provides for the recovery of attorney's fees to the prevailing party in \r\n  a Â§ 1983 action. It states in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981a, 1982, \r\n  1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow \r\n  the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's \r\n  fee as part of the costs. . . .\r\n  \r\n42 \r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1988(b).\r\n  \r\nA \"prevailing \r\n  party\" includes a party who has obtained a settlement of claims under Â§ 1983. \r\n  Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 \r\n  (1980). Thames and the Sheriff's Office do not dispute that Mrs. Lawson qualifies \r\n  as the prevailing party under Â§ 1988. Thus, her settlement does not preclude \r\n  recovery under Â§ 1988. However, in this case, Mrs. Lawson executed a settlement \r\n  and Release which purported to settle all claims arising out of the death of \r\n  her husband, and it specifically directed that 40% of the proceeds be paid as \r\n  compensation for attorney's fees. In her Petition dated October 7, 1997, Mrs. \r\n  Lawson asked the court to approve the settlement. In paragraph 13, she \"represent[ed] \r\n  to the court that she has an agreement with her counsel for the payment of attorney[']s \r\n  fees for counsel's representation of the petitioner and the estate in this matter \r\n  and that pursuant to such agreement, the total sum of forty (40) percent \r\n  of the gross settlement should be authorized for payment to her counsel from \r\n  the proceeds of this settlement as attorneys fees.\" (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  settlement order of the same date included the following provision as to attorney's \r\n  fees:\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  petitioner has agreed with her attorney that he should be paid forty (40) percent \r\n  of the gross proceeds of this settlement; the court has reviewed the matter \r\n  and under these circumstances, concludes that such is reasonable, and from the \r\n  proceeds of settlement, the sum of forty (40) percent of the gross settlement \r\n  is authorized as payment of attorney's fees.\r\nThe \r\n  order further provided the amount paid by the defendants was \"in full settlement \r\n  of all claims arising from the death of the petitioner's decedent.\"  \r\n  (2) \r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  its December 10, 1997 order denying attorney's fees, the trial judge found the \r\n  issue of attorney's fees was \"completely and fairly disposed of in [the October \r\n  7 \r\n  order] putting into effect the Settlement Agreement between the parties,\" noting \r\n  Mrs. Lawson was authorized by the agreement to pay her attorney from the gross \r\n  proceeds of the settlement. He further cited the United States Court of Appeals' \r\n  commentary in the case of Bell v. Schexnayder, \r\n  36 F.3d 447, 450 (5th Cir. 1994) as follows: \r\n  \r\nTo \r\n  the extent that plaintiff's counsel harbored a secret intent to seek attorney's \r\n  fees -- after the parties had agreed on a settlement amount, after the \r\n  case had been removed from the docket, and after the District Court had entered \r\n  a dismissal order -- that intent was concealed from defendants. On \r\n  this record, the District Court could conclude that plaintiffs' counsel knew \r\n  that his request for attorneys' fees . . . was totally unanticipated by defendants \r\n  and came as a complete shock to them. The District Court acted properly in denying \r\n  the fee request. Holding otherwise would run counter to three goals encouraged \r\n  by our judicial system: voluntary settlements of disputes, the enforcement of \r\n  agreements according to the objective intent of the parties, and an end to litigation.\r\n  \r\n(emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  trial court rejected Mrs. Lawson's argument that a specific waiver of attorney's \r\n  fees must appear in the settlement agreement to preclude a subsequent award \r\n  under Â§ 1988. See, e.g., Ashley \r\n  v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 794 F.2d 128 (3rd Cir. 1986) (initial settlement \r\n  draft waived the right to attorney's fees, the revised version did not; court \r\n  held the issue of attorney's fees was not precluded); Swan \r\n  v. Daniels, 917 F. Supp. 292 (D. Del. 1995) (no mention of attorney's \r\n  fees was made in the settlement; issue held not abandoned). We can envision \r\n  circumstances such as those present here where the requirement of a specific \r\n  waiver would work an injustice on the parties. In contrast to Swan, \r\n  where the parties did not mention attorney's fees in their settlement agreement, \r\n  the current appeal is not a situation where the subject appears to have been \r\n  left open for future negotiation or determination. Cf. Young \r\n  v. Powell, 729 F.2d 563 (8th Cir. 1984) (because attorney's fees was \r\n  one of the issues raised in the complaint, a settlement disposing of \"all disputed \r\n  issues\" held to encompass attorney's fees).\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  this case, we agree with the trial judge that the order putting into effect \r\n  the Settlement Agreement between the parties completely disposed of the issue \r\n  of attorney's fees and, had Mrs. Lawson intended to seek additional attorney's \r\n  fees under Â§ \r\n  1988, she should have disclosed this intention at the hearing on the petition \r\n  to approve the settlement. Mrs. Lawson's attorney should have disclosed the \r\n  existence of the alleged assignment of Â§ 1988 attorney's fees and the intent \r\n  that the settlement not preclude recovery of those fees under Â§ 1988 in order \r\n  to reserve the issue for future determination. The assignment was allegedly \r\n  made a year before the settlement, but it \r\n  was not until after the settlement had been finalized that Mrs. Lawson's attorney \r\n  revealed to opposing counsel the existence of the document. Also, counsel admittedly \r\n  did \r\n  not mention the assignment or the intent to seek additional attorney's fees \r\n  at the settlement hearing. \r\n  \r\nAlthough \r\n  Mrs. Lawson's attorney argues the issue of attorney's fees need not be addressed \r\n  in the settlement, and a party could thereafter seek attorney's fees under Â§ \r\n  1988, the case before us is distinguishable. The settlement order here clearly \r\n  indicated Brown was entitled to attorney's fees of 40% of the gross proceeds \r\n  of settlement. No appeal was taken from this order. Mrs. Lawson's attorney could \r\n  obtain no more rights than she had. Under the unique circumstances found in \r\n  this case, we conclude the issue of attorney's fees was foreclosed by the parties' \r\n  settlement. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court's decision denying the award \r\n  of additional attorney's fees to the estate.\r\n  \r\nB. \r\n  Appeal of Sumter County Sheriff's Office and Thames\r\n  \r\nOfficer \r\n  Thames and the Sheriff's Office argue the trial court erred in denying their \r\n  request for attorney's fees and sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP. They assert \r\n  the imposition of sanctions is warranted because the petition for additional \r\n  attorney's fees above and beyond the 40% Brown received under the settlement \r\n  agreement was \"frivolous.\"\r\n  \r\nRule \r\n  11 provides that the signature of an attorney on a pleading, motion, or other \r\n  paper of a party shall constitute a certificate that the attorney has read the \r\n  document and that to the best of the attorney's knowledge, information, and \r\n  belief \"there is good ground to support it\" and \"it is not interposed for delay.\" \r\n  Rule 11(a), SCRCP. Where \"a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation \r\n  of this Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose \r\n  upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate \r\n  sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the \r\n  amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, \r\n  motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\" Id.\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  trial court declined the request by Officer Thames and the Sheriff's Office \r\n  for sanctions and attorney's fees to be imposed on Brown under Rule 11. We find \r\n  no basis to disturb this ruling. The imposition of sanctions under Rule 11 is \r\n  a matter left to the discretion of the trial court. Although we find the settlement \r\n  was conclusive on \r\n  the issue of attorney's fees, Brown's attempt to pursue attorney's fees under \r\n  Â§ 1988 and his presentation of the issue to the trial court, though found to \r\n  be without merit, do not rise to the level which would allow us to conclude \r\n  the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in failing to impose a sanction. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court's decision \r\n  in this regard.\r\n  \r\nFor \r\n  the foregoing reasons, the order below is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCURETON \r\n  and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n1. A \r\n  question was raised as to Brown's standing to seek fees in this instance because \r\n  the fees are payable to the prevailing party (the client), and not the attorney. \r\n  The defendants argued that Brown petitioned for the attorney's fees in the trial \r\n  court on his own behalf. However, Brown asserted Mrs. Lawson was the named petitioner. \r\n  The appeal has been made in Mrs. Lawson's name.  \r\n\r\n2. \r\n   No appeal was taken from this order.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3114","title":"Bernhardt v.

Vaughn brought this action as personal representative of \r\n  the estate of Mary Henrietta Bernhardt, deceased, to recover funds John R. Bernhardt \r\n  withdrew from joint survivorship accounts held with the deceased. John was the \r\n  nephew of Mary Henrietta Bernhardt, and withdrew the funds seven days prior \r\n  to her death. The accounts were opened by the deceased naming John as a joint \r\n  party having a right of survivorship. She was the sole contributor of the funds. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  case was submitted to the probate court based upon stipulated facts, and the \r\n  court found that the funds belonged to the estate of Mary Henrietta Bernhardt. \r\n  The court ruled that the statutory presumption of entitlement to funds under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-6-104(a) (1987) which John would have had as the sole surviving \r\n  party to each joint account only applied to sums on deposit in joint survivorship \r\n  accounts at the death of the contributing party. The court ruled that because \r\n  John withdrew the funds before his aunt's death, he was not entitled to the \r\n  presumption. The court ordered him to repay the estate, less funds he used to \r\n  pay funeral and other related expenses. The circuit court affirmed the probate \r\n  court. John appeals. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nSeveral \r\n  years prior to her death, Mary Henrietta Bernhardt opened several joint bank \r\n  accounts, certificates of deposit, and investments containing right of survivorship \r\n  provisions, which she titled in her name and that of her nephew, John. On June \r\n  7, 1995, she was admitted to St. Francis Hospital where she remained until her \r\n  death on June 22, 1995. She was eighty-two years old when she died. \r\n  \r\nOn \r\n  June 15, 1995, John transferred all of the funds from the accounts to a new \r\n  account(s) titled in his name alone. The funds in the joint accounts were contributed \r\n  solely by his aunt. There is no indication she participated with or consented \r\n  to John's transfer of the funds to the new account(s). \r\n  \r\nAfter \r\n  his aunt died, John withdrew $5000 from the new account(s) to settle her funeral \r\n  expenses. Vaughn, as personal representative of the estate, demanded the balance \r\n  of the funds. Upon John's refusal, Vaughn brought this action. \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  issue on appeal is whether the funds withdrawn by John prior to his aunt's death \r\n  belong to him as a result of the joint accounts having right of survivorship, \r\n  or become the property of the estate by virtue of their withdrawal prior to \r\n  his aunt's death. John asserts the probate court erred in concluding that he \r\n  was not entitled to a presumption of an inter vivos gift to him by \r\n  the establishment of the account, or ownership by virtue of a presumption of \r\n  entitlement upon the death of his aunt under the right of survivorship provisions \r\n  contained within each joint account. \r\n  \r\nAs \r\n  the essential character of the cause of action is for the recovery of money, \r\n  we conclude the action is at law. See \r\n  NationsBank of South Carolina v. Greenwood, \r\n  321 S.C. 386, 392, 468 S.E.2d 658, 662 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"The determination of \r\n  the standard of review by an appellate court of matters originating in the probate \r\n  court is controlled by whether the cause of action is at law or in equity. To \r\n  make this determination, the appellate court must look to the essential character \r\n  of the cause of action alleged by the petitioners in the court below.\"); Gilford \r\n  v. South Carolina Nat. Bank, 257 S.C. 374, 186 S.E.2d 258, (1972) (issue \r\n  of ownership between joint account survivor and heirs is an issue at law and \r\n  not equity); In re Tollison, \r\n  320 S.C. 132, 463 S.E.2d 611 (Ct. App. 1995) (petition in probate court for \r\n  money damages is an action at law). Where the essential nature of the cause \r\n  of action is legal, the action to be taken by the reviewing court is controlled \r\n  by its determination of whether or not there is any evidence to support the \r\n  factual findings of the court below. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSouth \r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 34-11-10 (Supp. 1998) provides, \"when a deposit has been \r\n  made in a bank . . . in the names of two or more persons, . . . the deposit \r\n  or any part thereof may be paid to any of the persons, whether the other or \r\n  others are living or not. . . .\" Prior to the amendment of this provision, our \r\n  supreme court interpreted this section to give rise to a rebuttable presumption \r\n  upon the creation of a joint survivorship account that account funds are intended \r\n  to be a gift to the surviving account holder. Johnson \r\n  v. Herrin, 272 S.C. 224, 250 S.E.2d 334 (1978). John argues the probate \r\n  court erred by failing to apply this presumption. \r\n  \r\nHowever, \r\n  in 1990 the legislature amended section 34-11-10, making it \"subject to\" the \r\n  provisions of sections 62-6-101, et. seq., of the Probate Code. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 34-11-10 (Supp. 1998); Estate of \r\n  Chappell v. Gillespie, 327 S.C. 617, 491 S.E.2d 267 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  The rights of parties (1) to a multiple-party \r\n  account are governed by the provisions of the Probate Code contained in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-6-101, et seq. (1987). The Probate Code provides, \"[a] joint \r\n  account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion \r\n  to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear \r\n  and convincing evidence of a different intent.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-6-103(a) \r\n  (1987). The Probate Code further provides a presumption of survivorship, stating \r\n  in pertinent part: \"[s]ums remaining on deposit at the death of a party \r\n  to a joint account belong to the surviving party or parties as against the estate \r\n  of the decedent unless there is a writing filed with the financial institution \r\n  at the time the account is created (or subsequently as provided under Â§ 62-6-105) \r\n  which indicates a different intention.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-6-104(a) (1987) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nUnder \r\n  the Probate Code, the presumption created in favor of the non-contributing survivor \r\n  to a joint account only applies to those funds remaining on deposit \r\n  at the death of the contributor. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-6-104(a) (1987). As the \r\n  probate court recognized, when the funds have been withdrawn before the death \r\n  of the contributing party, there are no funds on deposit to which the presumption \r\n  may apply. \r\nOur \r\n  probate code is equally clear in stating that funds placed in a joint account \r\n  with right of survivorship remain the property of the contributing party until \r\n  that party's death, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different \r\n  intent. S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 62-6-103(a) (1987). Consequently, no inference can be \r\n  drawn from the mere fact a joint account was established that the contributing \r\n  party intended to make an immediate gift of the funds to the non-contributing \r\n  party. Nor can the inference of an inter vivos gift be taken from the \r\n  mere maintenance of the joint account once established, because the law presumes \r\n  that it remains the property of the contributing party during that party's lifetime \r\n  absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. This is so, notwithstanding \r\n  the fact that the non-contributing party has legitimate access to the funds \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-11-10 (Supp. 1998), because, as previously noted, \r\n  the legislature amended Â§ 34-11-10 to make it subject to the provisions of Â§ \r\n  62-6-101, et. seq., of the Probate Code.\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  reaching this conclusion, the probate court found support in Shourek \r\n  v. Stirling, 621 N.E.2d 1107 (1993), an Indiana case with similar facts. \r\n  We also find the reasoning of Shourek \r\n  to be sound. In Shourek, a niece \r\n  withdrew funds from a joint account shortly before her aunt's death. As in the \r\n  present case, the aunt made all contributions to the joint account. The personal \r\n  representative sought to recover the funds after the aunt's death. The Indiana \r\n  court addressed provisions in the Indiana code similar to our Probate Code sections \r\n  62-6-103 and 104. The Supreme Court of Indiana held the funds in the account \r\n  presumptively belonged to the aunt during her lifetime unless clear and convincing \r\n  evidence of a contrary intent was established. The court found that for the \r\n  statutory presumption of survivorship to apply, the funds must have remained \r\n  on deposit when the aunt died. Since the niece withdrew the funds prior to her \r\n  aunt's death, the court held the niece had to establish her entitlement to the \r\n  funds without the benefit of the presumption. The court noted that although \r\n  the deposit agreements gave the niece the right to withdraw funds from the account, \r\n  the agreements did not create an ownership right in the funds that were withdrawn. \r\n  The court remanded the case to the trial court to determine if an inter \r\n  vivos gift had occurred. Shourek \r\n  v. Stirling, 621 N.E.2d 1107 (1993). \r\n  \r\nApplying \r\n  the reasoning of Shourek to \r\n  this case, it is undisputed John withdrew the funds prior to his aunt's death. \r\n  This action was well within his right, under the provisions of the account, \r\n  section 34-11-10, and as a statutorily defined party under section 62-6-101(7). \r\n  However, at the time of withdrawal, the presumption of ownership under section \r\n  62-6-103(a) enured to the benefit of his aunt as the sole contributor. At her \r\n  death, there were no sums remaining on deposit. Therefore, the presumption of \r\n  survivorship under section 62-6-104 was not triggered. John then had the burden \r\n  of proving entitlement to the funds by establishing that his aunt intended an \r\n  inter vivos gift or by establishing a proper testamentary disposition. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis \r\n  case was tried in the probate court based upon a written stipulation of facts. \r\n  Those facts are scant, providing nothing beyond that which is recited in this \r\n  opinion. Having no further information upon which to base a decision, the probate \r\n  court was well within the evidence in concluding that there was no clear and \r\n  convincing proof of an inter vivos gift to John. Therefore, during \r\n  her lifetime, Mary had a cause of action against John to recover the funds. \r\n  See Trotter \r\n  v. First Federal Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 298 S.C. 85, 378 S.E.2d 267 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989) (noting joint account holder may have brought an action against other \r\n  party to account to recover funds the second party withdrew). Her personal representative \r\n  \"has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this State and the \r\n  courts of any other jurisdiction as [her] decedent had immediately prior \r\n  to death.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-703 (1987) (emphasis added). We also conclude \r\n  the probate court properly refused to apply a presumption of ownership through \r\n  the survivorship provisions because there were no sums remaining on deposit \r\n  in joint accounts at the death of Mary Henrietta Bernhardt. \r\n  \r\nWe \r\n  note however that our decision is limited to the facts of this case and does \r\n  not address what evidence John could have presented to overcome the presumption \r\n  of ownership during the lifetime of the parties as established under section \r\n  62-6-103(a). The Probate Code recognizes the parties' authority to contractually \r\n  alter a statutory presumption. See, \r\n  e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-6-104(a) \r\n  (1987) (stating that \"[s]ums remaining on deposit at the death of a party to \r\n  a joint account belong to the surviving party or parties as against the estate \r\n  of the decedent unless there \r\n  is a writing filed with the financial institution at the time the account is \r\n  created . . . which indicates a different intention.\" (emphasis added)). Therefore, \r\n  the parties could have contractually altered the presumption of ownership under \r\n  section 62-6-103(a). A provision in the instrument establishing a joint account \r\n  indicating that each party is a co-owner or joint tenant is evidence tending \r\n  to rebut the presumption that the parties intended ownership to remain solely \r\n  with the contributing party. In the present case, however, the record omits \r\n  any documentation surrounding the establishment of the joint account and provides \r\n  no other evidence of an inter vivos gift. Accordingly, we are constrained \r\n  by the general presumption in section 62-6-103 and are compelled to reach this \r\n  unfortunate result.\r\n  \r\n \r\n  The court was correct in placing the burden of proof under these circumstances \r\n  upon John to establish his entitlement to the funds, and the record sustains \r\n  the court's conclusion that he did not carry that burden. \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, \r\n  the order of the probate court is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCURETON \r\n  and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n1.  \"'Party' means \r\n  a person who, by the terms of the account, has a present right, subject to request, \r\n  to payment from a multiple-party account.\" S.C.

We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\n On September 27, 1991, John Gilstrap, \r\n  a sergeant with the City of Greenville Police Department, fell thirty to forty \r\n  feet while repelling during a department training exercise. As a result of the \r\n  fall, Gilstrap sustained severe injuries including: a burst fracture at L1; \r\n  a sacral fracture; a pelvic fracture; foot strain; symphysial diastasis with \r\n  bladder herniating between the diastasis; and a neurogenic bladder. Gilstrap \r\n  underwent emergency spinal surgery the day of the fall but the burst fracture \r\n  nonetheless left him with significant paralysis from the waist down. After the \r\n  fall, Gilstrap was also noted to have pre-existing arthritis of the knee and \r\n  degenerative disc disease. Dr. Clark Jernigan gave Gilstrap an eighty-one percent \r\n  impairment rating. Because of his injuries, it is unlikely he will be able to \r\n  work again. Gilstrap completed the twelfth grade and has never done any other \r\n  type of work except police work. He worked for the Police Department for seventeen \r\n  years prior to the accident. \r\n  \r\nPROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nThe City of Greenville contended \r\n  Gilstrap's preexisting degenerative disk disease combined with his injuries \r\n  to cause substantially greater disability and medical costs than would have \r\n  resulted from the injuries alone. To obtain reimbursement from the Second Injury \r\n  Fund, the City filed a form 54 with the Workers' Compensation Commission. The \r\n  Fund countered with a form 55 which denied the City's allegation Gilstrap's \r\n  injuries and expenses were substantially increased by a preexisting impairment \r\n  and simultaneously moved any hearing on the matter be delayed until Gilstrap \r\n  received a Final Award or agreement for his disability. \r\n  \r\nOn June 17, 1997, the Single Commissioner \r\n  denied the Fund's motion to delay a determination. The Commissioner's Order \r\n  concluded: 1) substantially all of Gilstrap's disability was caused by the fall \r\n  rather than his preexisting condition; 2) Gilstrap is a paraplegic as a result \r\n  of the fall and cannot suffer greater disability under S.C. Code Ann. Section \r\n  42-9-10 (1985) than that caused by the paraplegia; 3) the City did not meet \r\n  the knowledge requirement of S.C. Code Ann. Section 42-9-400(c) (1985) regarding \r\n  Gilstrap's left knee; and 4) there is no evidence Gilstrap incurred greater \r\n  medical expenses due to his preexisting condition. \r\n  \r\nThe Single Commissioner's findings \r\n  and conclusions were affirmed in toto by the Full Appellate Panel on \r\n  February 10, 1998. The circuit court also affirmed the Order of the Full Commission \r\n  on July 27, 1998. \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nOn appeal, the City argues it is \r\n  entitled to reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund. The legislative purpose \r\n  of the Second Injury Fund is to \"encourage the employment of disabled or handicapped \r\n  persons without penalizing an employer with greater liability if the employee \r\n  is injured because of his preexisting condition.\" Liberty \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 516, 518, \r\n  458 S.E.2d 550, 551 (1995) (citing Springs \r\n  Industries v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 296 S.C. 359, 372 S.E.2d \r\n  915 (Ct. App. 1988)). \r\n  \r\nReimbursement from the Fund is controlled \r\n  by S.C. Code Ann. Section 42-9-400 (1985) which provides in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\n(a) If an employee who has a permanent \r\n  physical impairment . . . incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident \r\n  arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in compensation \r\n  and medical payments liability or either, for disability that is substantially \r\n  greater, by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and \r\n  subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation of the preexisting impairment, \r\n  than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, . \r\n  . . but such employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the \r\n  Second Injury Fund as created by 42-7-310 for compensation and medical benefits \r\n  in the following manner:\r\n  \r\n(1) Reimbursement of all compensation \r\n  benefit payments payable subsequent to those payable for the first seventy-eight \r\n  weeks following the injury.\r\n  \r\n(2) Reimbursement of fifty percent \r\n  of medical payments in excess of three thousand dollars during the \r\n  first seventy-eight weeks following the injury and then reimbursement of all \r\n  medical benefit payments payable subsequent to the first seventy-eight weeks \r\n  following the injury; provided, however, in order to obtain reimbursement \r\n  for medical expense during the first seventy- eight weeks following the subsequent \r\n  injury, an employer or carrier must establish that his liability for medical \r\n  payments is substantially greater, by reason of the combined effects of the \r\n  preexisting impairment and subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation \r\n  of the preexisting impairment, than that which would have resulted from the \r\n  subsequent injury alone.\r\n(Emphasis added). Additionally, section \r\n  42-9-400 contains a 'knowledge' requirement which states:\r\n  \r\n(c) In order to qualify under this \r\n  section for reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund, the employer must \r\n  establish when claim is made for reimbursement thereunder, that the employer \r\n  had knowledge of the permanent physical impairment at the time that the employee \r\n  was hired, or at the time the employee was retained in employment after the \r\n  employer acquired such knowledge. Provided, however, the employer may qualify \r\n  for reimbursement hereunder upon proof that he did not have prior knowledge \r\n  of the employee's preexisting physical impairment because the existence of such \r\n  condition was concealed by the employee or was unkown to the employee.\r\n  \r\n(d) As used in this section, \"permanent \r\n  physical impairment\" means any permanent condition, whether congenital or due \r\n  to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle \r\n  to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if the employee should \r\n  become unemployed.\r\n  \r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\nIn reviewing an agency order, this \r\n  court \"may not substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.\" Clade \r\n  v. Champion Laboratories, 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998) \r\n  (citing Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., \r\n  320 S.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357 (1996)). \"'Substantial evidence' is evidence which, \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion that the administrative agency reached.\" Lark \r\n  v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135-136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)(citation \r\n  omitted). \r\n  \r\nThe Full Commission found the City \r\n  was not entitled to reimbursement from the Fund for greater medical or compensation \r\n  expenses. We initially note the distinction between an employer's greater liability \r\n  for compensation and an employer's greater liability for medical expenses. When \r\n  an employee has been found to be totally disabled by an accident, an employer \r\n  cannot incur greater liability for compensation due to a preexisting condition. \r\n  See Liberty \r\n  Mutual Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, supra.. \r\n  Therefore the lower court properly refused the City's request for compensation \r\n  reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund.\r\n  \r\nNonetheless, an employer may incur \r\n  greater liability for a totally disabled employee's medical payments due to \r\n  a preexisting condition. However, in the instant case, the only evidence of \r\n  greater medical expenses due to Gilstrap's preexisting condition was a cat scan \r\n  and a possible knee injection. Dr. Jernigan estimated the cost of the cat scan \r\n  at $500.00 to $600.00. No value was placed on the knee injection. \r\n  Compared to the cost of Gilstrap's entire hospital stay ($153,989.79) $500.00 \r\n  or $600.00 does not constitute a substantial increase in medical expenses. \r\n  \r\nJernigan conceded at the time of \r\n  his testimony that the preexisting condition did not affect the length of time \r\n  necessary for Gilstrap to reach maximum medical improvement. Additionally, per \r\n  Jernigan, Gilstrap's paraplegia may have decreased his sensation of arthritis \r\n  pain in his knee. We find this testimony constitutes substantial evidence supporting \r\n  the lower court's affirmance of the Full Commission's Order. \r\n  \r\nMoreover, the Full Commission found \r\n  the City did not meet the knowledge requirement of section 42-9-400(c) with \r\n  respect to Gilstrap's knee. In order to meet this requirement, the City had \r\n  the burden of proving at least one of the following circumstances: 1) it had \r\n  knowledge of Gilstrap's arthritis at the time Gilstrap was hired; 2) Gilstrap \r\n  concealed his arthritis from the City; or 3) Gilstrap did not know he had arthritis. \r\n  The record revealed Gilstrap had prior surgery on his knee. Therefore, he was \r\n  presumably aware he had arthritis in this knee. The City, however, failed to \r\n  present any evidence Gilstrap intentionally concealed this information. Thus, \r\n  even if the City had incurred substantially greater medical expenses because \r\n  of the arthritis in Gilstrap's knee, the City would not qualify for reimbursement \r\n  under subsection (c).\r\n  \r\nThe City asks this court to determine \r\n  whether it may bring an action for reimbursement of future medical expenses \r\n  once they are incurred. Jernigan testified Gilstrap is likely to have major \r\n  problems in the future due to the progression of his degenerative disc disease. \r\n  Jernigan described Gilstrap as \"a time bomb and he's going to wear out.\" We \r\n  make no ruling as to the City's entitlement to reimbursement for future medical \r\n  expenses incurred because of Gilstrap's degenerative disk disease. This court \r\n  may not issue advisory opinions. Booth \r\n  v. Grissom, 265 S.C. 190, 217 S.E.2d 223 (1975).\r\n  \r\nThe City did not meet its burden \r\n  of proof under section 42-9-400, either in terms of demonstrating a substantial \r\n  increase in medical and compensation expenses or in terms of the knowledge requirement. \r\n  Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3116","title":"Loadholt v.

We reverse.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nSherry \r\n  Capers, Tounda Taylor, and Kim Davenport (collectively \"Respondents\") filed \r\n  three separate actions in the United States District Court against Hampton County \r\n  and Sheriff Loadholt. They alleged Loadholt had committed acts of sexual misconduct \r\n  while they were employees of Hampton County. Capers and Taylor worked as dispatchers \r\n  and jailers for Hampton County. Davenport was a secretary at the Sheriff's Department \r\n  and the jail. Respondents alleged that, in each of the instances, Loadholt summoned \r\n  them to his office on the pretext of discussing jail or sheriff's department \r\n  business. Once in his office, Loadholt would lock the door and then ask them \r\n  questions regarding their sexual histories and sexually molest or assault them. \r\n  Capers and Davenport resigned their positions after the alleged incidents. Taylor \r\n  was terminated by Loadholt. \r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  their complaints, each of the Respondents described multiple incidents and alleged \r\n  causes of action for (1) sexual harassment, (2) violations of constitutional \r\n  rights (specifically, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment), (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (4) assault, (5) \r\n  battery, (6) false imprisonment, and (7) invasion of privacy. Taylor also alleged \r\n  a cause of action for retaliatory discharge. She asserted Loadholt fired her \r\n  in retaliation for filing a complaint with the South Carolina Human Affairs \r\n  Commission and for signing warrants charging Loadholt with criminal sexual conduct \r\n  and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.\r\n  \r\nAppellant, \r\n  the Insurance Reserve Fund (the Fund), issued a general tort liability policy \r\n  to the named insured, Hampton County. Loadholt, as the Sheriff of Hampton County, \r\n  was included under the policy as a member of law enforcement.\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  Fund refused to provide coverage to Loadholt or defend him in the underlying \r\n  actions, asserting coverage only applies to an insured while \"acting in the \r\n  scope of his or her official duties.\" Loadholt failed to answer the three complaints \r\n  and the district court entered default judgments against him on the issue of \r\n  liability. The only remaining issue for trial was damages. In an apparent effort \r\n  to mitigate damages, Loadholt executed confessions of judgment to the Respondents \r\n  for $250,000 each. Prior to confessing judgment, Loadholt sought a defense from \r\n  the Fund, which the Fund refused.\r\n  \r\nLoadholt \r\n  subsequently brought this declaratory judgment action in the circuit court against \r\n  the Fund to determine whether the policy issued by the Fund to Hampton County \r\n  provides coverage for the damages alleged by the Respondents in their federal \r\n  actions. The Fund filed a counterclaim and a third-party complaint against the \r\n  Respondents to determine their interests in the action. The Fund sought a declaratory \r\n  judgment to the effect that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Loadholt \r\n  under the general tort liability policy. \r\n  \r\nRespondents \r\n  and the Fund moved for summary judgment. At the hearing, Loadholt supported \r\n  Respondents' motion for summary judgment. The circuit court ruled Loadholt was \r\n  entitled to coverage under the policy for the claims made by the Respondents. \r\n  The circuit court ordered the Fund to pay $250,000 to each of the Respondents, \r\n  as well as interest at a rate of 14% per year, in accordance with the confessed \r\n  judgments. The court amended its order on a motion for reconsideration by the \r\n  Fund, but did not change its substantive effect. The Fund appeals, raising numerous \r\n  issues challenging the order of the circuit court.\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n\"It \r\n  is generally held that the jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment is \r\n  discretionary, and should be exercised with great care, and with due regard \r\n  to all the circumstances of the case.\" Southern \r\n  Ry. Co. v. Order of Ry. Conductors of America, 210 S.C. 121, 134, 41 \r\n  S.E.2d 774, 779 (1947).\r\n  \r\nA \r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined \r\n  by the nature of the underlying issues. Felts \r\n  v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991). If an action \r\n  is at law, it retains this character, and the Court of Appeals must affirm where \r\n  there is any evidence to support the judge's findings. Id. \r\n  A declaratory judgment action to interpret an insurance contract is an action \r\n  at law. Cobb. v. Benjamin, 325 \r\n  S.C. 573, 482 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n  \r\nA \r\n  trial court may properly grant summary judgment when \"the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP. See also Tupper \r\n  v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable \r\n  inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party. Summer v. Carpenter, \r\n  328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997); City \r\n  of Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union, 323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d \r\n  747 (1996).\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  Fund argues Loadholt was not an insured under the general tort liability policy \r\n  because he was not \"acting within the scope of his official duties.\" We agree.\r\n  \r\nUnder \r\n  the policy, the Fund agreed to pay on behalf of the \"insured\" all sums which \r\n  the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal \r\n  injury or property damages. \r\n  \r\n\"Insured\" \r\n  is defined as \"any person, entity or organization qualifying as an insured in \r\n  the 'Persons Insured' provision.\" \r\n  \r\nSection \r\n  IV. PERSONS INSURED, prior to January 1, 1991, defined an \"insured\" as follows:\r\n  \r\n(b) \r\n  Any employee of the entity designated in the declarations as \"named insured\" \r\n  is an insured, but only while the employee is acting in the course of his or \r\n  her employment.\r\n  \r\nEffective \r\n  January 1, 1991, an endorsement changed this definition to:\r\n  \r\n(b) \r\n  Any employee of the entity designated in the declarations as \"named insured\" \r\n  is an insured, but only while the employee is acting in the scope \r\n  of his or her official duties. \r\n  (1) \r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  Fund changed its definition of an \"insured\" in response to South \r\n  Carolina State Budget and Control Board. v. Prince, 304 S.C. 241, 403 \r\n  S.E.2d 643 (1991). In Prince, \r\n  the court held that the chairman of a school board's finance committee was \"acting \r\n  in the course of employment\" when he called a press conference to voice his \r\n  concerns about the school board chairman's fiscal management of the school district, \r\n  so that he was an insured under the liability policy issued to the school board. \r\n  The court held that \"acting in the course of employment\" was broader than the \r\n  phrase \"acting in the scope of official duty.\" The court found there was an \r\n  ambiguity in the policy because it purported to provide coverage for certain \r\n  intentional torts under the policy's definition of covered \"personal injuries,\" \r\n  which specifically included coverage for defamation, yet also purported to deny \r\n  coverage for injuries expected or intended by the insured under the policy's \r\n  definition of \"occurrence.\"\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  response to Prince's assertion \r\n  that the \"scope of employment\" was a broader concept than \"scope of official \r\n  duties,\" the Fund changed its definition of \"insured\" in the policy, effective \r\n  January 1, 1991, so as to provide coverage only for acts committed \"while the \r\n  employee is acting in the scope of his or her official duties.\" \r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  Doe v. South Carolina Budget and Control \r\n  Board., 329 S.C. 214, 494 S.E.2d 469 (Ct. App. 1997), aff'd \r\n  Op. No. 25020 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 22, 1999) (Shearhouse Ad. Sh. No. 35 \r\n  at 50), this Court analyzed the definition of \"insured\" currently used by the \r\n  Fund in its general tort liability policy: an insured is an employee \"acting \r\n  in the scope of his or her official duties.\" In Doe, \r\n  two women alleged a police officer, Roberson, sexually assaulted them. Roberson \r\n  preceded each assault by stopping the victims' vehicles for DUI investigations. \r\n  He coerced the victims to meet with him nearby, where he had sex with them in \r\n  exchange for not arresting them on a DUI charge. The victims sued and the Fund \r\n  refused to defend or indemnify the defendants.\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  Doe court held the Fund was \r\n  not required to defend or indemnify the defendants under its general tort liability \r\n  policy. The Court noted the policy expressly limited an \"insured\" to an employee \r\n  acting in the scope of his official duties. The Court held a police officer's \r\n  duties do not include all conduct that the officer might engage in while on \r\n  duty, citing South Carolina Medical \r\n  Malpractice Liability Insurance Joint Underwriting Ass'n v. Ferry, 291 \r\n  S.C. 460, 463, 354 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1987) (scope of professional services does \r\n  not include all forms of conduct engaged in by members of a profession).\r\n  \r\nThe \r\n  Doe court further observed that \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-11-140(A) (Supp. 1998) provides that tort liability coverage \r\n  protects government employees \"against tort liability arising in the course \r\n  of employment.\" The Court also noted that our supreme court stated in Prince \r\n  that \"course of employment\" requires some act in furtherance of the employer's \r\n  business. The Court concluded, \"[N]o cogent argument can be made that Roberson \r\n  was furthering the business of his employer at the time he sexually assaulted \r\n  Appellants.\" Doe, 329 S.C. at \r\n  220, 494 S.E.2d at 473.\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  this appeal, although Loadholt required Respondents to report to his office \r\n  to discuss county business, his subsequent alleged sexual assaults on Respondents \r\n  clearly exceeded the scope of his official duties as Sheriff of Hampton County, \r\n  just as the offending conduct of the police officer did in Doe. \r\n  This is an express limitation of the Fund's policy definition of \"persons insured.\" \r\n  Although Loadholt was on duty as sheriff, working in his county office and allegedly \r\n  \"discussing county business\" prior to and at the time of the alleged assaults, \r\n  his duties as sheriff did not encompass all conduct in which he engaged in while \r\n  on duty. Similarly, Loadholt's alleged sexual assaults were outside the \"course \r\n  of employment\" under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-11-140(A) as Loadholt was not furthering \r\n  the business of his employer at the time of the alleged assaults. See \r\n  Doe, 329 S.C. at 220, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 473.\r\n  \r\nIn \r\n  addition to the claims addressed above, respondent Taylor alleged Loadholt fired \r\n  her in retaliation for filing a complaint against him with the South Carolina \r\n  Human Affairs Commission and for signing warrants charging him with criminal \r\n  sexual conduct and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. The \r\n  hiring and firing of employees clearly falls within the scope of Loadholt's \r\n  official duties as Sheriff of Hampton County. Since Loadholt's firing of Taylor \r\n  falls within the scope of his official duties, making him an \"insured\" under \r\n  the general liability policy, we must inquire whether the firing of Taylor is \r\n  covered as a \"personal injury\" under the policy's definitions. The term \"personal \r\n  injury\" is defined in two ways as follows:\r\n  \r\n\"Personal \r\n  Injury\" means\r\n  \r\n\r\n  bodily injury caused by an occurrence.\r\n  injury arising out of one or more \r\n    of the following offenses committed during the policy period:\r\n  \r\n    false arrest, detention, imprisonment, \r\n      malicious prosecution, or humiliation;\r\n    wrongful entry or eviction or \r\n      other invasion of the right of private occupancy;\r\n    a publication or utterance of \r\n      a libel or slander or other defamatory or disparaging material;\r\n    assault and battery not committed \r\n      by or at the direction of the insured unless committed for the purpose of \r\n      protecting persons or property;\r\n    discrimination on the basis \r\n      of race, sex, age, religion, or handicap;\r\n    denial of due process as guaranteed \r\n      by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \r\n      States.\r\n    violation of the following Amendments \r\n      to the Constitution of the United States: \r\n       \r\n        \r\n          First Amendment\r\n            Fourth Amendment\r\n            Eighth Amendment\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nTaylor's \r\n  claim of retaliatory discharge clearly is not a \"bodily injury caused by an \r\n  occurrence.\" Taylor's claim is also not viable under the enumerated offenses \r\n  in subpart two of the \"personal injury\" section. Even though Loadholt is an \r\n  \"insured\" for the purposes of Taylor's retaliatory discharge claim, the claim \r\n  itself is not covered under the Fund's general tort liability policy.\r\nBecause we find Loadholt is not an \r\n  \"insured\" under the Fund's general tort liability policy for the claims of sexual \r\n  harassment, violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \r\n  intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, false imprisonment, \r\n  and invasion of privacy and that retaliatory discharged is not covered as a \r\n  \"personal injury,\" we need not address the Fund's other issues on appeal. \r\n  \r\nREVERSED.\r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN \r\nand ANDERSON, JJ., concur. \r\n1. The allegations \r\n  of Taylor and Davenport all occurred after January 1, 1991. The allegations \r\n  of Capers occurred from June 1989 to August 1993. Prior to January 1, 1991, \r\n  the Fund's policy was a claims-made policy. In 1991, it was converted into an \r\n  occurrence policy. Because Capers did not report her claim prior to January \r\n  1, 1991, her claims must be assessed based upon the policy in effect when her \r\n  claim was reported, \"namely in 1993 or 1994.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3117","title":"State v.

On appeal, \r\n  Stokes asserts the following errors require reversal: (1) refusal of his Batson \r\n  (1) motion; (2) allowing the State to exhibit the child victim to \r\n  the jury at the conclusion of the evidence; (3) exclusion of impeachment evidence; \r\n  and (4) the failure to charge mere presence. We reverse and remand for a new \r\n  trial.\r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nStokes and Deshawn Shivers lived \r\n  together in a mobile home with Shivers' two-year-old son. On December 28, 1996, \r\n  Stokes and Shivers argued until Shivers left the mobile home without her son \r\n  and walked to her grandmother's nearby residence. Shivers returned several minutes \r\n  later to retrieve her son, but Stokes refused to let her re-enter to get the \r\n  child. She called the police for help. \r\n  \r\nWhen two sheriff's deputies arrived \r\n  and knocked on the front door, Stokes came to the door and spoke with them. \r\n  According to the deputies, Stokes first asked to speak to an Orangeburg City \r\n  police detective, and then stated to the deputies: \"[Y]ou might as well go ahead \r\n  and arrest me. I've hurt him.\" Shivers then ran unaccompanied into the trailer, \r\n  returning shortly thereafter holding her son. Her son had an electrical cord \r\n  wrapped around his neck, and Shivers claimed she found the child unconscious \r\n  under a bed in the back bedroom. The child was limp, gasping for air and foaming \r\n  at the mouth and nose. There were marks on the child's neck which were consistent \r\n  with strangulation. Fortunately, the child fully recovered from his injuries. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nStokes was charged with Assault and \r\n  Battery with Intent to Kill (ABIK), and was convicted of the lesser-included \r\n  offense of ABHAN. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Victim \r\n  as an Exhibit\r\n  \r\nStokes argues the trial court erred \r\n  in allowing the State to introduce the child as an exhibit because the demonstration \r\n  had no evidentiary value and was highly inflammatory and prejudicial. We agree.\r\n  \r\nThe defense asked the court not to \r\n  allow the State to exhibit the child to the jury. The State conceded the child \r\n  had no marks, and that they did not seek to demonstrate anything about the child \r\n  for evidentiary purposes. The State asserted two bases for exhibiting the child \r\n  to the jury. First, they desired to introduce the child, \"just to show that \r\n  the child is just a fine child. He's a beautiful little boy.\" Second, they asserted \r\n  that the child had a right to be present as a victim. (2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe court ultimately ruled that the \r\n  child could be \"introduced\" as an exhibit, and brought before the jury, \"for \r\n  the purpose of showing intent, if any.\"\r\n  \r\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, \r\n  the court allowed the assistant solicitor to \"mark\" the child as an exhibit, \r\n  and then carry him before the jury, while the trial judge introduced him by \r\n  saying \"That's the young fellow all of the talk is about. . . . He won't be \r\n  in your jury room, but the State asked to use him as an exhibit . . . .\" \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Stokes argues that showing \r\n  the child in this way to the jury, especially at the conclusion of the evidence, \r\n  improperly invoked sympathy for the child in the minds of the jury and unduly \r\n  prejudiced the jury against him as the alleged perpetrator, while serving no \r\n  legitimate evidentiary purpose. \r\n  \r\nThe display of a person or body part \r\n  to the jury in criminal cases as demonstrative evidence is not unusual where \r\n  it tends to establish a fact in controversy. See \r\n  29A Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§Â§ \r\n  950-56 (Supp. 1998). For many years, exhibiting an infant was employed in South \r\n  Carolina and other jurisdictions as a means of comparing features in an attempt \r\n  to prove paternity, or to establish the child as a product of unlawful seduction. \r\n  See State \r\n  v. Heavener, 146 S.C. 138, 143 S.E. 674 (1928). In such instances, the \r\n  child is said to have been placed in evidence. See \r\n  Id. The same legal safeguards \r\n  are thus invoked as with other evidence; including the requirement as to relevance. \r\n  See Id.\r\n  \r\nThe trial judge has broad discretion \r\n  in ruling on questions regarding the relevancy of evidence, and his decision \r\n  will be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion. State \r\n  v. Cooney, 320 S.C. 107, 463 S.E.2d 597 (1995). Evidence is relevant \r\n  if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter in issue \r\n  upon which it directly or indirectly bears. State \r\n  v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 342 S.E.2d 401 (1986); See \r\n  Rule 401, SCRE. On the other hand, evidence \"should be excluded if it is calculated \r\n  to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury or is irrelevant or unnecessary \r\n  to substantiate the facts.\" State v. \r\n  Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 647, 515 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1999). Even if the evidence \r\n  is not relevant, its admission may constitute harmless error if the irrelevant \r\n  evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial. See \r\n  State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 547 (1991). \r\n  \r\nIn the present case, there was no \r\n  question about the size or physical capability of the victim. He was only two \r\n  years old at the time of the assault, and three years of age at trial. The State \r\n  conceded that the victim had no injuries or marks at the time of trial. Furthermore, \r\n  photographs of the victim taken at the time of the alleged assault were introduced \r\n  in the State's case, clearly identifying the child to the jury, depicting the \r\n  size and features of the child, and showing the injuries on his chest and neck. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State argues on appeal that the \r\n  viewing of the child at trial was relevant on the issue of Stokes' intent because \r\n  it allowed the jury to compare the healthy victim displayed at trial with the \r\n  injured victim as shown in the photographs, thus providing a basis for assessing \r\n  the extent of his injuries. This argument fails, however, because the photographs \r\n  clearly depict the injuries, none of which were contested. Furthermore, there \r\n  is absolutely no evidence that the child suffered from any birthmarks or other \r\n  markings which might alter the appearance of the wounds. Consequently, we find \r\n  this argument to be without merit. See \r\n  State v. Livingston, 327 S.C. \r\n  17, 488 S.E.2d 313 (1997). (3) We conclude exhibiting \r\n  the child to the jury at the conclusion of the evidence had no direct bearing \r\n  upon, nor did it tend to establish or make more or less probable any matter \r\n  in controversy. \r\n  \r\nThe State next argues that the display \r\n  of the child was cumulative to the photographs which were properly admitted, \r\n  and any error was harmless. See \r\n  Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  547 (1991)(finding that even if the evidence is not relevant, its admission \r\n  may constitute harmless error if the irrelevant evidence did not affect the \r\n  outcome of the trial). We disagree with the State on this point. We are unable \r\n  to say that the error could not have affected the outcome under the circumstances \r\n  of this case. \r\n  \r\nThe allegations against Stokes are \r\n  most egregious, and quite naturally they evoke great sympathy for the victim, \r\n  who is both blameless and defenseless. It would be unreasonable to assume that \r\n  no prejudice occurred merely because viewing the child was cumulative to the \r\n  photographs. In reality, exhibiting the child to the jury is more likely to \r\n  elicit from the jury an enduring sympathetic response for the helpless victim \r\n  and a corresponding resentment for the accused. Where such is likely to occur, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"[C]ourts must be extremely careful \r\n  that no evidence of a tendency to excite or influence the resentment of jurors, \r\n  and which does not tend to support the evidence . . . or to connect the defendant \r\n  with the commission of the crime, should be permitted to go to the jury.\"\r\n  \r\nPeople \r\n  v. Kearney, 17 N.E. 736, 738 (N.Y. 1888); See \r\n  Livingston, 327 S.C. at 488 \r\n  S.E.2d at 313; see also \r\n  Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  98 (1999)(finding evidence should be excluded if it is calculated to arouse \r\n  the sympathy or prejudice of the jury or is irrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate \r\n  the facts).\r\n  \r\nIn this case guilt was hotly contested. \r\n  Shivers had the same access to the child on the day of the assault as Stokes, \r\n  and Stokes attempted to place the blame on her. Conversely, much of the State's \r\n  evidence of guilt depended upon Shivers's credibility, which was called into \r\n  question by her pre-trial conduct. \r\n  \r\nStokes testified, and denied that \r\n  he made the inculpatory statements attributed to him by the deputies. Under \r\n  Stokes's version of events, he and Shivers had argued since Shivers tried to \r\n  get fertility pills from her doctor on the previous day. Stokes claimed the \r\n  parties were arguing because Shivers wanted to conceive a child, whereas he \r\n  wanted to complete his college education. Stokes testified Shivers became hysterical \r\n  and began hitting him. She called the child to the back of the home, where she \r\n  remained for about five or ten minutes. She then announced she was going to \r\n  the mailbox and left through the back door while he remained in the front of \r\n  the home, watching T.V. Stokes denied knowing the child was still in the mobile \r\n  home after Shivers left. According to Stokes, he did not see her leave, and \r\n  assumed the child was with her because it was so quiet in the home. \r\n  \r\nWhen Shivers ultimately ran into \r\n  the home to retrieve her son after the deputies arrived, she stated she found \r\n  him unconscious under a bed in the back bedroom. According to deputies, she \r\n  returned to the front door carrying the child less than forty seconds later. \r\n  Photographs of the interior revealed that the bedroom was disheveled, with clothes \r\n  strewn all around, arguably making discovery of what lay under the bed more \r\n  difficult. Stokes argued at trial that the short amount of time within which \r\n  Shivers found the unconscious child and returned to the front of the home inferred \r\n  that she already knew where the child was located, and that she was the assailant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nStokes's theory of Shivers's culpability \r\n  is further advanced by Shivers's conduct after Stokes was arrested. Shivers \r\n  claimed her actions during and after this incident were motivated by her fear \r\n  of Stokes. In contrast to this testimony, Stokes introduced nude photographs \r\n  of Shivers which she admitted giving to him after his arrest. She included notes \r\n  on the back indicating the photos were of her breast and stomach, because she \r\n  carried his child. She also sent him various letters and poems indicating her \r\n  affection for him, and her remorse for \"telling a lie on him.\" One letter referred \r\n  to Stokes as her \"favorable husband,\" and contained the phrase \"free the innocent.\" \r\n  Somewhat in conflict with her professed fear of Stokes, Shivers admitted continuing \r\n  to cultivate her relationship with Stokes. She attempted to explain this as \r\n  a subterfuge in order to remain close to Stokes so that she could find out why \r\n  he had hurt her child. Most telling, however, is a document written by Shivers \r\n  entitled \"True confession about 12-28-96,\" the date of this incident. In this \r\n  document Shivers recanted her earlier version of events, exculpating Stokes \r\n  completely, and concluding with the following statement: \"Mr. Stokes did not \r\n  have any knowledge about this incident that occurred and I plea [sic] the 5th.\"\r\n  \r\nViewing the two diametrically opposed \r\n  versions of the events, either one of which is plausible, and considering that \r\n  each version depends in large part upon the credibility of Shivers and Stokes, \r\n  we conclude that there is a real possibility the exhibition of the child victim \r\n  at the conclusion of the evidence interjected an improper influence on the jury \r\n  affecting the outcome. The evidence of Stokes' guilt is far from overwhelming. \r\n  Accordingly, the error was not harmless, and requires reversal. See \r\n  Livingston, 327 S.C. 17, 488 \r\n  S.E.2d 313 (1997); See also \r\n  Langley, 334 S.C.643, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  98 (1999)(holding where evidence of murder defendant's guilt was not overwhelming, \r\n  admission of irrelevant evidence was reversible error).\r\n \r\nII. Excluded \r\n  Impeachment Evidence\r\n  \r\nAt trial, Stokes sought to impeach \r\n  Shivers by showing that she presently was charged with Assault and Battery with \r\n  Intent to Kill involving an unrelated incident and that Stokes had obtained \r\n  a restraining order against her. He contends the trial court's exclusion of \r\n  this impeachment evidence constitute reversible error. However, the record reflects \r\n  that this issue was only raised and ruled on in \r\n  limine. Stokes never raised \r\n  the issue again at any time during the trial. Merely raising an argument in \r\n  limine does not preserve the \r\n  issue for appellate review. See \r\n  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. \r\n  502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993). Since this issue is not preserved, we decline to \r\n  reach the merits of the argument. (4) \r\nIII. Mere \r\n  Presence Charge\r\n  \r\nNext Stokes asserts the trial court \r\n  erroneously refused his request to give the jury a mere presence charge. Because \r\n  this issue may arise again on re-trial, we will address it.\r\n  \r\nThe law to be charged in a case is \r\n  determined by the evidence presented at trial. State \r\n  v. Dennis, 321 S.C. 413, 468 S.E.2d 674 (Ct. App. 1996). If the evidence \r\n  supports it, the defendant is entitled to a mere presence charge. State \r\n  v. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 382 S.E.2d 911 (1989). Generally, a mere presence \r\n  charge is appropriate under two circumstances. First, if there is a doubt over \r\n  whether the defendant is guilty as an accomplice to a crime, the trial court \r\n  may be required to instruct the jury that mere presence at the scene is insufficient \r\n  to find the defendant guilty as an aider or abettor. Dennis, \r\n  321 S.C. at 413, 468 S.E.2d at 674. Second, in cases where the defendant is \r\n  charged with possession of contraband as a result of being present where contraband \r\n  was found, the court may be required to charge the jury that the defendant cannot \r\n  be found guilty of possession of contraband by being merely present near it. \r\n  Id.\r\n  \r\nThe State did not attempt to convict \r\n  Stokes on any theory of accomplice liability. Under the State's view of the \r\n  evidence, Stokes was the sole person present and committed the assault himself. \r\n  Conversely, Stokes maintained he was not present at the commission of the assault \r\n  upon the child. Consequently, there was no view of the evidence which would \r\n  support a charge on mere presence, and the trial judge correctly rejected the \r\n  requested instruction. See State \r\n  v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 380 S.E.2d 834 (1989). (5) \r\n  Furthermore, the trial judge's charge properly instructed that to find Stokes \r\n  guilty, the jury was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed \r\n  the assault upon the victim.\r\nIV. Batson \r\n  Issue\r\n  \r\nLastly, Stokes appeals \r\n  the trial court's ruling on his challenge to the State's discriminatory exercise \r\n  of its jury strikes. Because this issue is unlikely to arise upon retrial, we \r\n  decline to address it.\r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the conviction \r\n  for Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature is REVERSED, and the \r\n  case is REMANDED for a new trial on the lesser included offense of Assault and \r\n  Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature. (6) \r\n  \r\n \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n  \r\nCURETON, HEARN and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., CONCUR. \r\n1.  Batson \r\n  v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). \r\n2.  The State \r\n  does not assert this argument on appeal. \r\n3.  In Livingston, \r\n  the deceased's husband testified, during the Felony D.U.I. trial, about his \r\n  marriage to the 22-year-old victim two months before the fatal collision with \r\n  accused. His testimony included a short recitation of their move to Beaufort \r\n  and commencement of work. The court noted this poignant image was irrelevant \r\n  to the contested issues in the case because the identity of the victim and the \r\n  time and place of the accident were not disputed. The court found the testimony \r\n  to be highly inflammatory, thus mandating reversal. \r\n4.  Stokes' appellate \r\n  counsel conceded during oral argument that this issue had not been preserved \r\n  for appeal and was not properly before this Court. \r\n5.  In Lee, \r\n  the State produced evidence that tended to show defendant exercised actual possession \r\n  and control over cocaine. The defendant then presented evidence that the officers \r\n  knew he was not involved and were framing him, not that he just happened by \r\n  when someone dropped a bag of cocaine or that he was standing by while others \r\n  used or possessed cocaine. The court held that the evidence presented at trial \r\n  did not support a \"mere presence\" instruction. \r\n6.  Since Stokes \r\n  was acquitted by the jury of ABIK, double jeopardy bars a retrial on this charge. \r\n  See State \r\n  v. Owens, 309 S.C. 402, 424 S.E.2d 473 (1992). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3118","title":"Reed v.

Reed appeals an order compelling enforcement of a partial settlement agreement \r\n  purportedly reached between Reed and Associated Investments of Edisto Island, \r\n  Inc. and Lawrence Savage, III (collectively Associated) regarding Reed's purchase \r\n  of a beachfront lot from the corporation. We reverse and remand.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nIn 1993, Reed purchased a lot in \r\n  a beachfront community from Associated and constructed a home thereon. Reed \r\n  thereafter filed suit, accusing Associated of numerous misstatements and omissions. \r\n  For instance, Associated represented to Reed that the lot fell outside the boundary \r\n  established under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (1) \r\n  (COBRA) and was thus eligible for federally subsidized flood insurance. The \r\n  lot in fact did not fall outside the designated line. Reed alleged seven causes \r\n  of action: (1)&nbsp;fraud, (2) fraudulent inducement to execute a contract, \r\n  (3) constructive fraud, (4)&nbsp;breach of contract, (5)&nbsp;breach of contract \r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act, (6)&nbsp;negligence and negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  and (7) unfair and deceptive trade practices. Associated filed an answer generally \r\n  denying the allegations and asserted a third-party complaint against Engineering \r\n  and Technical Services, Inc., the engineering firm hired by Associated to plat \r\n  the COBRA line.\r\n  \r\nReed and Associated entered into \r\n  informal settlement negotiations. According to Associated, an agreement was \r\n  reached on June 30, 1997. The agreement provided: (1) Associated would pay Reed \r\n  $10,000, (2) Reed would dismiss his COBRA claims with prejudice, (3) the remaining \r\n  claims would be dismissed without prejudice, and (4)&nbsp;the settlement would \r\n  provide that Associated did not waive any statute of limitations defense for \r\n  the claims dismissed without prejudice. Counsel for Associated alleges that \r\n  Reed's attorney telephoned him and stated that he had spoken to Reed and Reed \r\n  agreed to accept all terms. Thereafter, one of Associated's attorneys sent Reed's \r\n  attorney a check for $10,000 along with the Settlement Agreement and an Order \r\n  of Dismissal.\r\n  \r\nA few weeks later, Reed's attorney \r\n  informed Associated that he would be filing a motion to be relieved as counsel \r\n  and would be returning the check and the unsigned agreement. Associated then \r\n  moved to compel enforcement of the settlement, attaching supporting affidavits. \r\n  At the motion hearing, Reed's attorney denied that the parties had fully agreed \r\n  on the terms of a possible settlement. He stated that although the parties agreed \r\n  in principle as to the amount of the settlement, they did not have a solid agreement \r\n  about how the statute of limitations issue was to be addressed. In response, \r\n  Associated stated it would no longer require Reed to dismiss the remaining claims \r\n  and urged the court to sever the agreement and enforce only the portion of the \r\n  settlement which dismissed the COBRA claims. Reed's attorney opposed the selective \r\n  enforcement of the agreement.\r\n  \r\nThe circuit court found that \"[b]ecause \r\n  of the time sensitive nature of the statute of limitations, because the settlement \r\n  as to the COBRA claim is admitted and in view of [Associated's] suggestion that \r\n  the Agreement is severable, . . . the Agreement between the parties should be \r\n  enforced, only as it relates to the COBRA claim, about which there is no dispute.\" \r\n  The court granted Associated's motion to compel but only insofar as it related \r\n  to the settlement and dismissal with prejudice of Reed's COBRA claims. The court \r\n  did not enforce a dismissal of the remaining claims as originally discussed \r\n  by the parties, but instead allowed the claims to remain pending.\r\n  \r\nReed appeals, arguing (1) the circuit \r\n  court erred in enforcing an oral settlement agreement violating the provisions \r\n  of Rule 43(k), SCRCP, and (2) the court erred in separating the settlement negotiations \r\n  and partially enforcing what the court believed to be the agreement.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nReed contends the alleged agreement \r\n  did not comply with the terms of Rule 43(k) nor was it admitted. Associated, \r\n  however, argues its settlement agreement with Reed is enforceable because it \r\n  was an admitted agreement.\r\n  \r\nRule 43(k), SCRCP, provides: \"No \r\n  agreement between counsel affecting the proceedings in an action shall be binding \r\n  unless reduced to the form of a consent order or written stipulation signed \r\n  by counsel and entered in the record, or unless made in open court and noted \r\n  upon the record.\" This rule was held to apply to settlement agreements in Ashfort \r\n  Corp. v. Palmetto Construction Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 458 S.E.2d \r\n  533 (1995). The Ashfort court \r\n  opined that \"the purpose of rules such as Rule 43(k) is: '[T]o prevent fraudulent \r\n  claims of oral stipulations, and to prevent disputes as to the existence and \r\n  terms of agreements and to relieve the court of the necessity of determining \r\n  such disputes[.]'\" Id. at 495, \r\n  458 S.E.2d at 535 (quoting 83 C.J.S. Stipulations \r\n  Â§ 4 (1953)). The court also noted that Rule 43(k) does \"not apply where the \r\n  agreement is admitted or has been carried into effect.\" Id. \r\n  at 494 n.1, 458 S.E.2d at 534 n.1. \r\n  \r\nTo support its claim that the agreement \r\n  was admitted, Associated submitted affidavits of its attorneys. In one, Associated's \r\n  attorney stated that Reed's attorney telephoned him and \"advise[d] him he had \r\n  spoken to Mr. Reed and Mr. Reed had agreed and accepted all terms and the matter \r\n  was therefore settled.\" Additionally, Associated's attorney maintained that \r\n  during the motion hearing Reed's attorney did not dispute they agreed to settle \r\n  the COBRA claim with prejudice for $10,000 and stated \"[i]f they don't want \r\n  to dismiss the others without prejudice, we don't have any statute of limitations \r\n  problem if it just stays where it is.\" Further, Associated's attorney argued \r\n  the agreement was severable because, whether the remaining (non-COBRA) claims \r\n  were dismissed without prejudice and then Reed had to refile them or whether \r\n  those remaining claims were simply not dismissed, there was an agreement that \r\n  the COBRA claim would be dismissed with prejudice for $10,000. He argued that \r\n  even if the judge found there was no meeting of the minds regarding dismissal \r\n  of the remaining claims, settlement of the COBRA portion should be enforced.\r\n  \r\nReed's attorney objected to a severance \r\n  of the allegedly undisputed portion of the settlement. He contended that although \r\n  the parties had an agreement in principle to settle the case for $10,000, \"there \r\n  was no meeting of the minds with respect to the statute of limitations in the \r\n  settlement agreement.\" He asserted, \"If the issue is whether the plaintiff admits \r\n  settlement, I can tell you most definitely that we do not admit that there was \r\n  a settlement.\" Counsel clearly disputed Associated's claim that the parties \r\n  had reached a final agreement on all of the terms. (2)\r\n  \r\nThe circuit court compelled enforcement \r\n  of the settlement for $10,000, but only as to the COBRA claims. The court stated \r\n  the other causes of action would not be dismissed so there would be no problem \r\n  concerning the statute of limitations. The court explained, \"I don't want him \r\n  prejudiced by the statute of limitations if \r\n  there wasn't a meeting of the minds.\" (Emphasis added.) From the court's \r\n  comments and the statements by Reed's attorney, it is evident this portion of \r\n  the agreement remained unsettled. It is clear the parties contemplated a full \r\n  settlement of the issues and their negotiations did not encompass a severance \r\n  of the agreement. \r\n  \r\nWhere the parties agree on the amount \r\n  of the settlement, but not the terms of the settlement, it is not admitted so \r\n  as to remove Rule 43(k)'s requirements. See \r\n  Galloway v. Regis Corp., 325 \r\n  S.C. 541, 481 S.E.2d 714 (Ct. App. 1997). As we read the record, we find the \r\n  trial court erred in concluding that Reed and Associated reached an agreement \r\n  about the terms of the settlement. \"Because the conditions upon which an agreed-upon \r\n  sum of money will be paid are material terms of any settlement agreement, the \r\n  absence of agreement on the terms of settlement is fatal . . . To conclude otherwise \r\n  would largely render meaningless the requirement that settlement agreements \r\n  be in writing.\" Id. at 546, \r\n  481 S.E.2d at 716. \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBecause it is clear from the record \r\n  that the parties had a partial agreement as to the money to be paid in contemplation \r\n  of a full settlement of the issues and the agreement was not admitted, the writing \r\n  requirements of Rule 43(k) preclude enforcement of the settlement. Accordingly, \r\n  the order compelling enforcement of a portion of the alleged settlement agreement \r\n  is\r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  (3)\r\n  \r\nCONNOR, ANDERSON, and STILWELL, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n1.  16 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§Â§ 3501 to 3510 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1999). \r\n2.  Reed's attorney \r\n  stated:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Your Honor, the plaintiff's position \r\n    is that while we had an agreement in principle as to the amount of this settlement, \r\n    $10,000, it was clear all along that one claim, the COBRA claim, would be \r\n    dismissed with prejudice, the other claim[s] would be dismissed without prejudice \r\n    to give my client the right to pursue those if he wanted to. It was critical \r\n    for us what the language was going to be addressing the statute of limitations. \r\n    Both [Associated's counsel] and I knew and discussed that there was a statute \r\n    of limitations issue. We did not, to my mind, have an understanding as to \r\n    specifically how that would be addressed. When I spoke with [Associated's \r\n    counsel] about the agreement, we came to a decision that $10,000 would be \r\n    the amount but the specifics of the agreement were not clear at that time. \r\n    Where I take issue with [his] affidavit is the concept that we had a solid \r\n    agreement on June 30th. \r\n\r\n3.  Because of \r\n  our disposition, we need not reach the issue of whether a court can compel, \r\n  under proper circumstances, the enforcement of a partial settlement agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3119","title":"Gray v.

Fleming, of Moss &amp; Kuhn, of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n  \r\nANDERSON, J.: The \r\n  Club Group, Ltd. (Club Group) appeals the Circuit Court's decision affirming \r\n  the Workers' Compensation Commission's order awarding benefits to Lisa Ricks \r\n  Gray (Mrs. Gray) for the death of her husband, James Gray (Gray), and holding \r\n  he was acting in the course and scope of his employment with Club Group at the \r\n  time of his accident.(1) We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nGray was employed as a bellman on \r\n  Hilton Head Island at Harbour Town, which is managed by Club Group. His duties \r\n  with Club Group included greeting guests, delivering documents, courier work, \r\n  running errands, and transporting guests. His normal working schedule was Monday \r\n  through Thursday and one day on the weekend, with Fridays off. \r\n  \r\n In January 1996, the part owner \r\n  and president of Club Group, Mark King, asked Gray if, for $35 including mileage, \r\n  he would transport payroll information and other items between Harbour Town \r\n  and the Henderson Golf Club (Henderson) in Savannah. Gray was to use his own \r\n  automobile, and King calculated the mileage from Gray's home in Savannah to \r\n  Henderson, then to Harbour Town, back to Henderson, and then to Gray's home. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHenderson is managed by CGL of Savannah \r\n  (CGL). King is one of the three owners of CGL. Club Group provides \"general \r\n  administrative services\" for CGL in its management of Henderson. While a CGL \r\n  check paid Gray for his services and mileage, King admitted he alone had the \r\n  right to fire Gray from his Friday courier duties. \r\n  \r\nGray lived near Henderson and, before \r\n  he started delivering payroll information between Harbour Town and Henderson, \r\n  would come over to Harbour Town on Fridays to pick up his paycheck. When he \r\n  started running deliveries between the companies, his normal routine was to \r\n  arrive at Henderson on Fridays between 8:00 a.m. and noon, pick up Henderson's \r\n  payroll data and anything else which needed to go, drive from Savannah to Hilton \r\n  Head, drop off the information, pick up anything to go to Henderson, and return \r\n  with Henderson's payroll checks. He was required to arrive back at Henderson \r\n  before 2:00 p.m.\r\n  \r\nHenderson is located off Highway \r\n  204 in the outer perimeter of Savannah near I-95. Highway 204 is a four-lane \r\n  divided highway characterized by fast-moving traffic. Henderson is equally accessible \r\n  from Highway 204 by two separate routes. Gray would travel west on Highway 204 \r\n  to get from his home to Henderson. Before his first trip to Henderson, Gray \r\n  asked a manager at Henderson, Peter Rouillard, for the best directions to where \r\n  he needed to go. He was told to take Highway 17 to Littleneck Road to a frontage \r\n  road into the golf course.\r\n  \r\nOn Friday, May 10, 1996, at about \r\n  the time he would normally be expected at Henderson, Gray was involved in a \r\n  serious car accident near Henderson on Highway 204. This was off the path given \r\n  to Gray by Rouillard, but still only a half mile from an entrance to Henderson. \r\n  Gray died as a result of the injuries from this accident. \r\n  \r\nA witness testified he saw Gray and \r\n  another car swerving in and out of traffic going an estimated 85 miles per hour. \r\n  Scott Simpkins, a Chatham County policeman, did not witness the accident, but \r\n  stated that according to his calculations, Gray was traveling in excess of 120 \r\n  mph. Simpkins explicated that eyewitness estimates may not be accurate, and \r\n  his calculations of speed, taken from skid marks and damage of the vehicles, \r\n  had never been proven wrong.\r\n  \r\nThe Single Commissioner found Gray \r\n  was employed by Club Group at the time of the accident and the accident was \r\n  within the course and scope of his employment with Club Group. The Single Commissioner \r\n  awarded benefits to his survivors. This order was affirmed by the Full Commission. \r\n  The Circuit Court affirmed the Full Commission's order.\r\n  \r\nISSUES\r\n  \r\nI. Did the Circuit Court err in applying \r\n  the wrong standard of review?\r\n  \r\nII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  failing to find Gray was an Independent \r\n  Contractor?\r\n  \r\nIII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  finding substantial evidence to support the decision of the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Commission?\r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\nI. Jurisdictional \r\n  Questions\r\n  \r\n\"Judicial review of a Workers' Compensation \r\n  decision is governed by the substantial evidence rule of the Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act. However, when the Commission's jurisdiction is at issue, the \r\n  reviewing court is not bound by the Commission's findings of fact upon which \r\n  jurisdiction is dependent.\" Lake v.

Georgetown County, \r\n  316 S.C. 92, 447 S.E.2d 841 (1994)).\r\n  \r\nIf the factual issue before the Full \r\n  Commission involves a jurisdictional question, this Court's review is governed \r\n  by the preponderance of the evidence standard. Vines v. Champion Bldg. Products, \r\n  315 S.C. 13, 431 S.E.2d 585 (1993); Lake v. Reeder Construction, at 247, \r\n  498 S.E.2d at 653. See also Kirksey v.

Charleston County Sch. Dist., \r\n  265 S.C. 21, 216 S.E.2d 755 (1975)(in determining whether Commission had jurisdiction \r\n  of claim presented, this Court is not bound by the finding of fact by the Commission; \r\n  this Court, and Circuit Court, has both the power and the duty to review entire \r\n  record and find therefrom jurisdictional facts, without regard to the conclusion \r\n  of Commission on such issue, and will decide jurisdictional question in accord \r\n  with the preponderance of evidence); Sanders v. Litchfield Country Club, \r\n  297 S.C. 339, 377 S.E.2d 111 (Ct.

Reeder Const. Co, \r\n  330 S.C. 242, 246, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 1998), this Court held:\r\n  \r\nOn appeal from the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Commission, this Court may reverse where the decision is affected by an error \r\n  of law. Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. \r\n  App.1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp.1997). The question of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Bridges v. Wyandotte Worsted Co., \r\n  243 S.C. 1, 132 S.E.2d 18 (1963); Bargesser v. Coleman Co., 230 S.C. \r\n  562, 96 S.E.2d 825 (1957); Roper Hosp. v. Clemons, 326 S.C. 534, 484 \r\n  S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App.1997). Furthermore, it is the burden of the appellant to \r\n  show that the Circuit Court's decision is against the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 180 S.E.2d 648 (1971); Lake,supra; \r\n  Crim v. Decorator's Supply, 291 S.C. 193, 352 S.E.2d 520 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\n  \r\nII. A.P.A. Standard \r\n  of Review\r\n  \r\nFor all non-jurisdictional matters, \r\n  the Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions \r\n  by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission. Lark v. Bi-Lo Inc., \r\n  276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981). The appellate court has the power upon \r\n  review to reverse or modify a decision if the findings and conclusions of the \r\n  administrative agency are affected by error of law, clearly erroneous in view \r\n  of the reliable and substantial evidence on the whole record, or arbitrary or \r\n  capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise \r\n  of discretion. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(g) (1986 &amp; Supp. 1998).\r\n  \r\nThe reviewing court may not substitute \r\n  its judgment for that of the Full Commission as to the weight of the evidence \r\n  on questions of fact, but may reverse if the decision is affected by an error \r\n  of law. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (1998); Stephen v. Avins Constr. \r\n  Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996). A reviewing court should \r\n  affirm a decision by the Full Commission unless it is clearly erroneous in view \r\n  of the substantial evidence on the whole record. Lark, supra. \r\n  Substantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would \r\n  allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion the Full Commission reached. \r\n  Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 441 S.E.2d 323 (1994). Furthermore, \r\n  \"'substantial evidence' is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence \r\n  viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering \r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion \r\n  that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify \r\n  its action.\"Lark at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Application of \r\n  the Wrong Standard of Review\r\n  \r\nClub Group maintains the Circuit \r\n  Court erred by applying the wrong standard of review in its determination of \r\n  Gray's employment status with Club Group. We agree. \r\n  \r\n The existence of the employer-employee \r\n  relationship is a jurisdictional question. Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 \r\n  S.C. 198, 482 S.E.2d 49 (1997); South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n \r\n  v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 459 S.E.2d 302 (1995); Wilson, \r\n  supra; Vines, supra; Givens v. Steel Structures, Inc., \r\n  279 S.C. 12, 301 S.E.2d 545 (1983); Canady, supra; Chavis, \r\n  supra; Lake, supra; Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., \r\n  321 S.C. 19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996). In addition, an injured worker's \r\n  employment status, as it affects jurisdiction, is a matter of law for decision \r\n  by the court and includes the findings of fact which relate to jurisdiction. \r\n  Lake at 247, 498 S.E.2d 653; Wheeler v. Morrison Machinery Co., \r\n  313 S.C. 440, 438 S.E.2d 264 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\n \r\nThe Circuit Court's application of \r\n  the substantial evidence standard of review to this issue was clearly error. \r\n  The Circuit Court should have taken its own view of the preponderance of the \r\n  evidence to review the jurisdictional question in this case. However, this error \r\n  is harmless. A review under a preponderance of the evidence standard supports \r\n  the finding Gray was acting within the scope of his employment as an employee \r\n  of Club Group at the time of his accident. \r\n  \r\nII. Employment Status\r\n  \r\nClub Group asserts the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in finding Grey was an employee rather than an independent contractor. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n  \r\nA Workers' Compensation award will \r\n  not be made unless an employment relationship existed at the time of the alleged \r\n  injury for which the claim is made. Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. \r\n  19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996); McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., \r\n  280 S.C. 466, 313 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1984). Before provisions of the Workers' \r\n  Compensation Act can apply, an employer-employee relationship must exist; this \r\n  is an initial fact to be established. Dawkins v. Capitol Constr. Co., \r\n  250 S.C. 406, 158 S.E.2d 651 (1967).\r\n  \r\nWhether an individual is an employee \r\n  or an independent contractor is a fact-specific determination reached by applying \r\n  certain general principles. S.C. Workers' Compensation Comm'n v. Ray Covington \r\n  Realtors Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 459 S.E.2d 302 (1995); Spivey v. D.G. Const. \r\n  Co., 321 S.C. 19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996). The South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court characterized the distinction between employees and independent contractors:\r\n  \r\nIt is not the actual control then \r\n  exercised, but whether there exists the right and authority to control and direct \r\n  the particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment. \r\n  \"An independent contractor is one who, exercising an independent employment, \r\n  contracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods, without being \r\n  subject to the control of his employer except as to the result of his work.\" \r\n  56 C.J.S. Master and Servant Â§ 3(1); and \"where one who performs work \r\n  for another represents the will of that other, not only as to the result, but \r\n  also as to the means by which the result is accomplished, he is not an independent \r\n  contractor but an agent;....\" 2 C.J.S. Agency Â§ 2d. \r\n  \r\nYoung v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, \r\n  189, 165 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1969). \r\n  \r\n \"The general test is whether the \r\n  alleged employer has 'the right and authority to control and direct the particular \r\n  work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.'\" S.C. \r\n  Workers' Compensation Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, \r\n  547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995)(citing Young). There are four factors \r\n  to determine the right of control. They are: (1) direct evidence of the right \r\n  or exercise of control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishing of equipment; \r\n  and (4) right to fire. Id.; Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. \r\n  196, 200, 174 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1970); Spivy, supra.\r\n  \r\nThis record epitomizes a factual \r\n  disputation regarding the relationship of Gray to Club Group and CGL. There \r\n  is no question Gray was an employee of Club Group Monday through Thursday and \r\n  one day on the weekend. It is the nature of his employment on Fridays in question. \r\n  King explained exactly what needed to be done on the Friday deliveries by Gray, \r\n  and told him the deliveries needed to be completed by 2:00 p.m. Friday afternoons. \r\n  Gray was paid an hourly rate Monday through Thursday and on the weekend. He \r\n  was paid $35 for the time he expended on Fridays. Gray was paid by Club Group \r\n  from a CGL account. All the checks for both companies were written by the controller \r\n  of Club Group, and Club Group determined what payments were made from what checkbooks. \r\n  While Gray used his own automobile when making his Friday deliveries, both King \r\n  and Christiana Martin, controller of Club Group, testified Gray was paid for \r\n  milege compensating for both gas and wear and tear on the vehicle. Finally, \r\n  King unequivocally retained the right to fire Gray if his work was not done \r\n  satisfactorily. \r\n  \r\n The Workers' Compensation Act is \r\n  to be given liberal construction, with doubts of jurisdiction resolved in favor \r\n  of inclusion of employees within Workers' Compensation coverage. Ost v. Integrated \r\n  Products, Inc., 296 S.C. 241, 371 S.E.2d 796 (1988); O'Briant v. Daniel \r\n  Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 254, 305 S.E.2d 241 (1983); White v. J.T. Strahan \r\n  Co., 244 S.C. 120, 135 S.E.2d 720 (1964); Pyett v. Marsh Plywood Corp., \r\n  240 S.C. 56, 124 S.E.2d 617 (1962); Horton v. Baruch, 217 S.C. 48, 59 \r\n  S.E.2d 545 (1950). Any reasonable doubts as to construction should be resolved \r\n  in favor of the claimant by including him within the coverage of the Workers' \r\n  Compensation Act rather than excluding him. Davis v. S.C. Dept. of Corrections, \r\n  289 S.C. 123, 345 S.E.2d 245 (1986). \r\n  \r\nBecause the issue in this case is \r\n  jurisdictional, this Court has the power and duty to review the record and decide \r\n  the jurisdictional facts in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  See Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, 482 S.E.2d 49 (1997); \r\n  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., \r\n  supra; Lake, supra. The factors set forth in Tharpe \r\n  are substantially satisfied in this case. We conclude by the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence that Gray was an employee of Club Group.\r\n  \r\nIII. Substantial Evidence \r\n  to Support the Decision of the Commission\r\n  \r\nFinally, Club Group contends the \r\n  Circuit Court erred in finding there was substantial evidence to support the \r\n  decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nA. Arising Out Of \r\n  and In the Course and Scope of Employment\r\n  \r\nClub Group avers there was no substantial \r\n  evidence to support the Commission's finding that Gray's fatal accident arose \r\n  out of and in the course and scope of Gray's employment. In order for an injury \r\n  to be compensable under the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act, it must \r\n  be an \"injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 1998). See Broughton v. South of \r\n  the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n  \r\nThe phrase \"arising out of \" refers \r\n  to the injury's origin and cause; where as, \"in the course of\" refers to the \r\n  time, place and circumstances under which the injury occurred. Baggott v. \r\n  Southern Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 496 S.E.2d 852 (1998); Broughton, \r\n  supra. Although the requirements are somewhat overlapping, they are not \r\n  synonymous and both must exist simultaneously to allow the claimant to recover. \r\n  See Branch v. Pacific Mills, 205 S.C. 353, 32 S.E.2d 1 (1944). \r\n\r\n  \r\n1. \"Arising out of\"\r\n  \r\nThe \"arising out of\" the employment \r\n  requirement for an injury to be compensable has been construed by our Supreme \r\n  Court:\r\n  \r\n\"It (the injury) arises 'out of' \r\n  the employment, when there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration \r\n  of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which \r\n  the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. Under this test, \r\n  if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work \r\n  and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole \r\n  situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, \r\n  then it arises 'out of' the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot \r\n  fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which \r\n  comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart \r\n  from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not \r\n  common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business \r\n  and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have \r\n  been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its \r\n  origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that \r\n  source as a rational consequence.\"\r\n  \r\nDouglas v. Spartan Mills, Startex \r\n  Div., 245 S.C. 265, 269, 140 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1965). \r\n  \r\nGray was employed to make deliveries \r\n  Friday mornings from Henderson to Hilton Head and then back. Here, the causal \r\n  connection required to be compensable is present. His accident was directly \r\n  attributable to his duties to act as a courier between Henderson and Hilton \r\n  Head. There is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that \r\n  Gray was required to pick up his deliveries in the morning, and but for his \r\n  employment he would not have been traveling to Henderson. Instead, he would \r\n  have been traveling to Hilton Head to pick up his paycheck, as was his custom \r\n  prior to his employment on Fridays.\r\n  \r\n2. \"In the Course \r\n  of the Employment\"\r\n  \r\nThe phrase \"in the course \r\n  of the employment\" refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which \r\n  the accident occurred. Owings v. Anderson County Sheriff's Dep't, 315 \r\n  S.C. 297, 433 S.E.2d 869 (1993); Loges v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 308 S.C. \r\n  134, 417 S.E.2d 538 (1992). An injury occurs \"in the course of\" employment within \r\n  the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act when it occurs within the period \r\n  of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance \r\n  of his duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incidental \r\n  thereto. Baggott v. Southern Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 496 S.E.2d 852 \r\n  (1998); Fowler v. Abbott Motor Co., 236 S.C. 226, 113 S.E.2d 737 (1960).\r\n  \r\nBroughton v. South of the Border, \r\n  336 S.C. 488, ___, 520 S.E.2d 634, 639 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n  \r\nGray normally arrived at Henderson \r\n  between 8:30 and 10:30 a.m. Henderson was located west of Gray's home on Highway \r\n  204. The accident occurred between 8:45 and 9:00 while Gray was driving west \r\n  on Highway 204 only a half mile from the entrance to Henderson. The time and \r\n  place of the accident lead to the conclusion that Gray was on his way to Henderson \r\n  to fulfill his employment duties.\r\n  \r\nThe factual findings of the Full \r\n  Commission are presumed correct and will only be set aside if unsupported by \r\n  substantial evidence. Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 466 \r\n  S.E.2d 357 (1996). We find there is substantial evidence to support the factual \r\n  finding that Gray's accident occurred \"arising out of\" and \"in the course of\" \r\n  his employment. \r\n  \r\nB. Going and Coming \r\n  Rule\r\n  \r\nClub Group argues even if Gray was \r\n  on his way to Henderson when the accident occurred, he is barred from recovery \r\n  by the going and coming rule. We disagree.\r\n  \r\n As a general rule, an employee going \r\n  to or coming from the place where his work is to be performed is not engaged \r\n  in performing any service growing out of and incidental to his employment, and, \r\n  therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such time does not arise out of \r\n  and in the course of his employment. Medlin v. Upstate Plaster Service, \r\n  329 S.C. 92, 495 S.E.2d 447 (1998). However, South Carolina has recognized a \r\n  number of exceptions to this rule:\r\n  \r\n(1) Where, in going to and returning \r\n  from work, the means of transportation is provided by the employer, or the \r\n  time that is consumed is paid for or included in the wages;\r\n  \r\n(2) Where the employee, on his way \r\n  to or from his work, is still charged with some duty or task in connection with \r\n  his employment;\r\n  \r\n(3) The way used is inherently dangerous \r\n  and is either\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (a) the exclusive way of ingress \r\n    and egress to and from his work; or\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  (b) constructed and maintained \r\n    by the employer; or\r\n\r\n  \r\n(4) That such injury incurred by \r\n  a workman in the course of his travel to his place of work and not on the premises \r\n  of his employer but in close proximity thereto is not compensable unless the \r\n  place of injury was brought within the scope of employment by an express or \r\n  implied requirement in the contract of employment of its use by the servant \r\n  in going to and coming from his work. \r\n  \r\nMedlin, 329 S.C. at 95-96, \r\n  495 at 449 (emphasis added). A fifth exception allows compensation where an \r\n  employee sustains an injury while performing a special task, service, mission, \r\n  or errand for his employer, even before or after customary working hours, or \r\n  on a day on which he does not ordinarily work. Id.; Bickley v. South \r\n  Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 259 S.C. 463, 192 S.E.2d 866 (1972).\r\n  \r\nWe find that the circumstances in \r\n  this case fit into the first exception to the \"going and coming rule.\" Gray \r\n  was paid for both his travel time and for mileage. His time and mileage began \r\n  when he left his home on Friday mornings. King testified these were both considerations \r\n  in determining how much Gray should be paid for his deliveries. There is substantial \r\n  evidence to support the Commission's finding that the first exception of the \r\n  going and coming rule applies.\r\n  \r\nC. Excessive Speed \r\n  Precluding Benefits\r\n  \r\nFinally, Club Group professes if \r\n  the going and coming rule does not apply, then recovery is still barred because \r\n  Gray substantially deviated from his employment. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nAn employee may, through his own \r\n  actions, deviate from his employment to an extent to take the employee outside \r\n  the course and scope of his employment. Boykin v. Prioleau, 255 S.C. \r\n  437, 179 S.E.2d 599 (1971) (employee took other employees on an extensive joy \r\n  ride instead of taking them home); White v. South Carolina State Highway \r\n  Department, 226 S.C. 380, 85 S.E.2d 290 (1955)(employee deviated from his \r\n  route twelve miles to pick up family).\r\n  \r\nClub Group asserts Gray's excessive \r\n  speed and \"racing\" are substantial deviations, which remove his accident from \r\n  the course and scope of his employment and preclude recovery of benefits. The \r\n  Full Commission found: 1) although Gray may have been speeding, this does not \r\n  constitute a substantial deviation; and 2) Club Group failed to prove Gray was \r\n  racing. \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina has not had opportunity \r\n  to address whether speeding is a substantial deviation, or would otherwise exempt \r\n  compensation. Few other states have addressed the issue. Most address speeding \r\n  in regards to their Workers' Compensation statutes, which disallow claims where \r\n  the injury is the result of the employee's \"willful misconduct.\" South Carolina \r\n  does not preclude recovery due to an employee's \"willful misconduct.\" \r\n  \r\nThe general rule in South Carolina \r\n  is \"fault has no bearing upon an employee's right to recover Workmen's Compensation \r\n  benefits, and finds application only in those cases where it is shown that the \r\n  acts of the employee are so serious and aggravated as to evince a wilful intent \r\n  to injure.\" Zeigler v. South Carolina Law Enforcement Div., 250 S.C. \r\n  326, 329, 157 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1967). The only exception under our statute is \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-60 (Supp. 1998):\r\n  \r\nNo compensation shall be payable \r\n  if the injury or death was occasioned by the intoxication of the employee or \r\n  by the wilful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\r\n  \r\nSince South Carolina does not look \r\n  to fault, Gray's speeding must be a substantial deviation to remove his actions \r\n  from the course of his employment, and disallow recovery of benefits. \r\n[W]hen an employee is in the performance \r\n  of the duties of the employer, the fact that the injury was sustained while \r\n  performing the duty in an unauthorized manner or in violation of instruction \r\n  or rules of the employer does not make the injury one incurred outside the scope \r\n  of employment. Exceeding a speed limit does not by itself constitute an abandonment \r\n  of employment. The result would be different if the claimant had been doing \r\n  something he was not authorized to do rather than doing a required act in an \r\n  unauthorized manner. \r\n  \r\n 2 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, \r\n  Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 37.02 (1999)(citing Williams v. Workmen's \r\n  Compensation Appeals Board, 116 Cal. Rptr. 607 (Cal. Ct. App. 1974))(emphasis \r\n  added). As the Appellate Court of Illinois held:\r\n  \r\nThe weight of authority is that excessive \r\n  speed, standing alone, does not, per se, disqualify a claimant from \r\n  recovery of benefits. . . . \"In this case, claimant was where he was supposed \r\n  to be, doing what he was hired to do, albeit in an obviously negligent manner. \r\n  That the risk was unreasonable is immaterial since the violation . . . occurred \r\n  within the course of claimant's employment.\"\r\n  \r\nStembridge Builders, Inc. v. Industrial \r\n  Comm'n, 636 N.E.2d 1088, 1092 (Ill. App. 1994) (quoting Chadwick v. Industrial \r\n  Comm'n, 534 N.E.2d 1000, 1002 (Ill. App. 1989)).\r\n  \r\nIn New York, benefits were challenged \r\n  under a Workers' Compensation statute similar to our own. The court enunicated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe statute does not, however, deprive \r\n  an employee or his dependents of workmen's compensation benefits because the \r\n  precise act of the employee leading to or causing the injury may be literally \r\n  in violation of a public statute, ordinance or regulation. This is especially \r\n  true of a violation of the complex and ubiquitous statutes and rules governing \r\n  the operation of motor vehicles on streets and highways.\r\n  \r\nThe exceptions to the general rule \r\n  of compensation are set out in Workmen's Compensation Law, Â§ 10. There is 'no \r\n  liability' for compensation where it is 'occasioned by intoxication' or 'by \r\n  wilful intention of the injured employee' to bring about his own or another \r\n  employee's injury. The statute discloses no interdiction on workmen's compensation \r\n  benefits because there has been carelessness. Indeed, the elimination of \r\n  the employee's negligence as a cause for defeating his right to benefits for \r\n  injury sustained in industrial mishap was one of the main objectives of the \r\n  sponsors of workmen's compensation.\r\n  \r\n An employee may lose compensation \r\n  benefits either by wilfulness or intoxication, neither of which is shown here. \r\n  What is shown is that the decedent went too fast around a curve and was too \r\n  far out of line and partly in the left lane of traffic; and that the operation \r\n  of the vehicle was contrary to a local speed ordinance.\r\n  \r\n To say this is merely to say that \r\n  decedent was negligent and that ingredient in his negligence was the act of \r\n  violating a speed ordinance. This does not take his death outside the scope \r\n  of the statutory benefits.\r\n  \r\nChaffee v. Effron, 149 N.Y.S.2d \r\n  115, 117 (N.Y. App. Div. 1956)(emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nWe hold Gray's exceeding the speed \r\n  limit in performance of his duties as a courier is not a substantial deviation, \r\n  sufficient to remove the accident from the course and scope of employment. There \r\n  is no evidence in the record to support Club Group's contention that Gray was \r\n  racing. Club Group relies on the WTOC videotaped newscast. Its introduction \r\n  was objected to, and the statements were hearsay. The Commission was correct \r\n  in finding that Club Group failed to prove Gray was racing at the time of the \r\n  accident. We make no conclusion as to whether speeding coupled with proven racing \r\n  is sufficient to take the actions of the employee out of the course of his employment.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nWe rule the Circuit Court erred in \r\n  applying a substantial evidence standard of review rather than a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence standard to the jurisdictional issue. However, this was harmless \r\n  error. We conclude the preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that \r\n  Gray was an employee of Club Group. We hold substantial evidence supports the \r\n  Commission's determination that Gray was acting within the course and scope \r\n  of his employment. The order of the Circuit Court affirming the award of benefits \r\n  by the Full Commission is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR, J., concurs.\r\n  \r\nSTILWELL, J., dissents in \r\n  separate opinion.\r\n  \r\nSTILWELL, J. (dissenting): \r\n  Because I do not believe the preponderance of the evidence indicates \r\n  that Gray was an employee of The Club Group at the time of the accident, I respectfully \r\n  dissent. \r\n  \r\nThe law to be applied in this situation \r\n  is clear and I agree the authorities cited by the majority control. I simply \r\n  disagree with the factual analysis and the application of the law to the facts. \r\n  I am not convinced the record substantiates by the preponderance of the evidence \r\n  that The Club Group had \"the right and authority to control and direct the particular \r\n  work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.\" South \r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n&nbsp;v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., \r\n  318 S.C. 546, 547, 459 S.E.2d 302, 303 (1995) (quoting Young v. Warr, \r\n  252 S.C. 179, 165 S.E.2d 797 (1969)).\r\n  \r\nThe analysis of Gray's relationship \r\n  with The Club Group or CGL on Fridays is seriously complicated primarily because \r\n  of the relationship between CGL and The Club Group and Mark King's role with \r\n  both. King, being a principal of both The Club Group, a South Carolina based \r\n  corporation, and CGL, a Georgia corporation, unquestionably had the right to \r\n  control and direct Gray in his capacity as an employee of The Club Group. \r\n  \r\nKing, together with Chris Martin, \r\n  the comptroller for The Club Group, offered Gray the Friday courier job. Martin \r\n  testified that it was the responsibility of CGL to transport the documents between \r\n  Hilton Head and Savannah. As further evidence of that fact, the former manager \r\n  of Henderson Golf Course, a CGL employee, was the delivery person immediately \r\n  prior to Gray assuming the task.\r\n  \r\nKing testified unequivocally that \r\n  the only condition placed upon Gray as to the manner or means of performing \r\n  the Friday task was that he must return to Henderson by 2:00 o'clock on Friday \r\n  to deliver the payroll checks to the employees of CGL. It is not at all unusual \r\n  that even in an independent contractor situation time constraints are imposed \r\n  on the performance of the task.\r\n  \r\nAs to the method of payment, it is \r\n  clear that Gray was paid a flat sum from a CGL account from which there were \r\n  no withholdings for taxes, social security, or any fringe benefits. He furnished \r\n  his own equipment, that being his vehicle. In contrast, he always drove The \r\n  Club Group's van when he ran errands on days of the week other than Friday. \r\n  While it is true that King testified that he retained the right to fire Gray, \r\n  he did not testify that that right sprang from his capacity as president of \r\n  The Club Group rather than as the principal of CGL who negotiated the agreement \r\n  with Gray. After all, an independent contractor agreement of no fixed duration, \r\n  just as employment at will, may be terminated at any time. Id. at 549, \r\n  459 S.E.2d at 303. \r\n  \r\nI would therefore hold that no employer-employee \r\n  relationship existed and the workers' compensation commission did not have jurisdiction.\r\n1. \r\n  CGL of Savannah is a named respondent in this appeal. However, there is no reason \r\n  to proceed with CGL in this matter. The Single Commissioner found CGL is exempt \r\n  from the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-360, \r\n  and no one has appealed that order. Concomitantly, no further consideration \r\n  of CGL of Savannah will be undertaken by this Court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3120","title":"State v.

Dickinson appeals his conviction for obtaining property under false pretenses \r\n  in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240 (Supp. 1999). He contends the trial \r\n  judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of aquittal as the state failed to \r\n  produce sufficient evidence that he obtained property from the victim with the \r\n  intent to cheat or defraud. We disagree and affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nOn January 10, 1998, Dickinson drove \r\n  a rental car to Ronnie Carter Pontiac (Dealer) in Rock Hill, South Carolina \r\n  and indicated a desire to purchase a vehicle. After test-driving several vehicles, \r\n  Dickinson decided on a brand new GMC Sonoma truck. Once Dickinson negotiated \r\n  a price for the truck, he informed Dealer that he would pay with cash he had \r\n  due to a family inheritance. He wrote a check to Dealer for $20,044.00. In the \r\n  purchase process, Dickinson gave a contact address which he said belonged to \r\n  a condominium he had recently purchased in Lake Club and was currently renovating. \r\n  Dealer also made a copy of Dickinson's driver's license. The address on the \r\n  driver's license was later determined to be non-existent. Dickinson then left \r\n  with the vehicle.\r\n  \r\nBecause January 10 was a Saturday, \r\n  Dealer could not verify the check until the following Monday. At that time, \r\n  the bank that the check was drawn upon indicated there were insufficient funds \r\n  to cover the check. Dealer began to leave voice mail messages for Dickinson. \r\n  Additionally, Dealer sent a certified letter to the Lake Club address provided \r\n  by Dickinson. The letter was undeliverable at that address, but was forwarded \r\n  by the post office to an address in Charlotte, North Carolina. The homeowner's \r\n  association at Lake Club indicated that Dickinson did not live there, and in \r\n  fact the address Dickinson gave had been vacant for almost two years. Dickinson \r\n  responded by fax and actually returned the vehicle ten days later on January \r\n  20, but he then continued faxing Dealer, conveying an intention to pay for the \r\n  truck with funds from another account. Dickinson never provided those funds.\r\n  \r\nOfficers with the York County Sheriff's \r\n  Department arrested Dickinson on February 25, 1998. At that time, Dickinson \r\n  admitted that he had never lived at the Lake Club address and that he knew he \r\n  did not have sufficient funds to cover the check when he wrote it.\r\n  \r\nAt trial, the facts above were all \r\n  testified to by witnesses for the state. Additionally, two witnesses, record \r\n  keepers from the two banks at which Dickinson maintained accounts, testified \r\n  that at no time during the period in question did Dickinson ever have over $994 \r\n  available on deposit.\r\n  \r\nAt the close of the state's case, \r\n  Dickinson moved for a directed verdict, which was denied, and the jury returned \r\n  a guilty verdict. The trial judge sentenced Dickinson to five years imprisonment.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict motion in a criminal case, this court must view the evidence in the \r\n  light most favorable to the state. State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 341, \r\n  372 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1988). If the state presents any evidence reasonably tending \r\n  to prove the defendant's guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt can be fairly \r\n  and logically deduced, the case is one the jury must decide. State v. Burdette, \r\n  335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999). Thus, as when a trial court decides \r\n  a directed verdict motion in a criminal case, we are concerned with the existence \r\n  or non-existence of evidence, not its weight. See Id.\r\n  \r\nThe evidence in this case is not \r\n  at issue. It is uncontroverted that Dickinson wrote a check which he knew could \r\n  not be honored in order to obtain a new vehicle. He also gave Dealer an address \r\n  at which he never resided. Additionally, he allowed Dealer to copy his driver's \r\n  license, which contained a non-existent address. After providing this false \r\n  information and a worthless check, Dickinson left with a new truck. Several \r\n  days later, Dealer realized the check could not be cashed and began making attempts \r\n  to contact Dickinson. It then realized that the contact information it had been \r\n  provided was false. About ten days later, Dickinson returned the truck. In the \r\n  interim, the South Carolina Department of Public Safety issued the title to \r\n  the truck in Dickinson's name. Also, Dickinson began making assurances that \r\n  he would make the check good.\r\n  \r\nThe state charged Dickinson with \r\n  violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240, which makes it a felony to \"by false pretense \r\n  or representation\" obtain \"from another person any chattel, money, valuable \r\n  security, or other property, real or personal, with intent to cheat and defraud \r\n  a person of that property . . . if the value of the property is five thousand \r\n  dollars or more.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240(1) (Supp. 1999). The supreme court \r\n  has defined this offense as requiring a fraudulent representation of a past \r\n  or existing fact by one who knows of its falsity, in order to induce \r\n  the person to whom it is made to part with something valuable. See \r\n  State v. Love, 275 S.C. 55, 62, 271 S.E.2d 110, 113-14 (1980) (quoting \r\n  State v. Haines, 23 S.C. 170). \r\n  \r\nWithout question, Dickinson's conduct \r\n  falls within the ambit of the statute at first glance. However, Dickinson argued \r\n  in his directed verdict motion, and contends on appeal, that he could not be \r\n  guilty of the offense until the title passed to him. In other words, he has \r\n  not actually obtained the vehicle merely by taking physical possession. To complete \r\n  the offense he must actually obtain the title as well. This distinction is of \r\n  grave importance here, because by the time the title passed Dealer knew the \r\n  check was worthless and the addresses were false. Furthermore, because Dickinson \r\n  then began to make representations that he would make the check good, these \r\n  promises involved future conduct and could not support a conviction for obtaining \r\n  goods under false pretenses. See State v. McCutcheon, 284 S.C. \r\n  524, 525, 327 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 1985) (\"A promise to do something in the \r\n  future cannot constitute the basis of a prosecution for obtaining goods under \r\n  false pretenses.\").\r\n  \r\nThe argument of course presupposes \r\n  that passage of title is a required element for completion of the offense. Dickinson \r\n  cites no case in support of this proposition(1), \r\n  and our research reveals no South Carolina cases dealing directly with this \r\n  issue. Thus, it is a question of first impression in this state.\r\n  \r\nWe are reminded that we must strictly \r\n  construe criminal statutes against the state and in favor of the defendant. \r\n  Williams v. State, 306 S.C. 89, 91, 410 S.E.2d 563, 564 (1991); State \r\n  v. Prince, 335 S.C. 466, 472, 517 S.E.2d 229, 232 (Ct. App. 1999). However, \r\n  the cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the court must ascertain \r\n  and effectuate the intent of the legislature, and in interpreting a statute, \r\n  the court must give the words their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting \r\n  to a tortured construction which limits or expands the statute's operation. \r\n  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, \r\n  476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996); Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 369, 468 S.E.2d \r\n  649, 650 (1996). Moreover, we should give statutory provisions a reasonable \r\n  construction consistent with the purpose of the statute. Jackson v. Charleston \r\n  County Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 181, 447 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1994).\r\n  \r\nThe statute in question makes no \r\n  mention of title or passage of title. It simply criminalizes \"obtaining\" the \r\n  property in question in a fraudulent manner. Black's Law Dictionary defines \r\n  \"obtain\" as follows: \"To get hold of by effort; to get possession of; to procure; \r\n  to acquire, in any way.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1078 (6th ed. 1990). \r\n  We find this to be the plain and ordinary meaning of the word. Furthermore, \r\n  we find actual, physical possession satisfies this definition. \r\n  \r\nThe statute makes it a crime to obtain \r\n  \"any chattel, money, valuable security, or other property, real or \r\n  personal.\" In other words it protects all species of property, without regard \r\n  to any special status, such as a titling requirement. The statute does not elevate \r\n  automobiles to any special protection because of the title laws. Conversely, \r\n  neither does the statute give any less protection to automobiles, which Dickinson's \r\n  argument has the practical effect of doing. The focus of the statute is on the \r\n  method of misappropriation and the property involved, not the form that possession \r\n  ultimately takes. Moreover, to focus on the passage of title would be irrelevant \r\n  when any title actually obtained would be void or voidable once the fraud was \r\n  discovered. This would render crimes involving titled property, such as automobiles \r\n  and real property, unpunishable under this statute, as good title would never \r\n  pass to a defendant who obtained it by fraud. As the legislature expressly included \r\n  real property in the ambit of the statute's protection, Dickinson's argument \r\n  cannot prevail. Additionally, Dealer, in reliance upon the false representations \r\n  of Dickinson, intended to transfer title to him contemporaneously. However, \r\n  through the fortuities of time, i.e., banking hours and paperwork delays in \r\n  the issuance of title, Dealer discovered the insufficiency of funds and falsity \r\n  of the representations before the title was actually issued. We will not allow \r\n  Dickinson to take advantage of sheer chance by reading an additional element \r\n  into a criminal statute. \"In a criminal prosecution it must appear not only \r\n  that the defendant has violated the letter of the law but the spirit thereof.\" \r\n  State v. DeAngelis, 257 S.C. 44, 52, 183 S.E.2d 906, 910 (1971) (Bussey, \r\n  J., dissenting). Dickinson has clearly violated both in the instant case. We \r\n  will not read into the statute a special requirement based on the type of property \r\n  involved, where the legislature has indicated an intention to protect all classes \r\n  of property equally.\r\n  \r\nWe find further support for our interpretation \r\n  in decisions of other jurisdictions whose statutes and case law are silent on \r\n  the subject of passage of title. In State v. Love, 440 P.2d 275 (Mont. \r\n  1968), the Supreme Court of Montana refused to require that both title and possession \r\n  pass in upholding a conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses, where \r\n  the applicable statute did not require that title pass. Love, 440 P.2d \r\n  at 279. In a case closer to home, the North Carolina Court of Appeals held in \r\n  State v. Kelly, 331 S.E.2d 227 (N.C. Ct. App. 1985), that neither their \r\n  statutory nor case law prescribed or implied passage of title as a necessary \r\n  element of the offense of obtaining property by false pretenses. Kelly, \r\n  331 S.E.2d at 230. We also find persuasive the fact that neither our legislature \r\n  nor prior case law has required passage of title for a conviction under Â§ 16-13-240.(2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause the state's evidence showed \r\n  that Dickinson violated the statute's express terms by making false representations \r\n  as to his address and uttering a check which he had grossly insufficient funds \r\n  to cover, thereby gaining actual possession of a new truck from Dealer, the \r\n  trial judge properly submitted the case to the jury. See State v. \r\n  Hicks, 77 S.C. 289, 57 S.E. 842 (1907) (If false pretenses are shown in \r\n  trial for obtaining property under false pretenses, intention is a question \r\n  of fact to be submitted to the jury.). \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and CURETON, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  \" - \" \r\n2.  - - - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3121","title":"Ex Parte: Allstate Insurance Co. v.

Before the trial, Tixier \r\n  offered only an amount well below his liability coverage limit of $15,000.\r\n  \r\nOn March 7, 1997, a jury heard the \r\n  case on both the issues of liability and damages and awarded Donaldson $36,447. \r\n  The trial court added $250 to this verdict for the deductible provision, for \r\n  a total verdict of $36,697. The trial court entered judgment in this amount \r\n  on June 4, 1997, and denied Tixier's post-trial motions October 3, 1997. Tixier \r\n  did not appeal the judgment. \r\n  \r\nAt the time of the collision, Donaldson \r\n  had a contract for UIM motorist coverage with a policy limit of $15,000 with \r\n  Allstate Insurance Company. On June 30, 1997, while Tixier's post-trial motions \r\n  were pending, Donaldson's counsel served Allstate with a copy of the summons \r\n  and complaint in this action through the South Carolina Department of Insurance. \r\n  Pursuant to statute, counsel for Allstate filed a notice of appearance on July \r\n  29, 1997.(2)\r\n  \r\nIn the notice of appearance, counsel \r\n  for Allstate denied the material allegations of Donaldson's complaint against \r\n  Tixier and demanded a jury trial. Counsel further averred he was not currently \r\n  representing Tixier, but reserved the right to assume control of the defense \r\n  in Tixier's name \"pursuant to the UIM motorist statute should the carrier choose \r\n  to exercise that option.\" Counsel further asserted as an affirmative defense \r\n  that Allstate was not notified of the suit against Tixier before the trial and \r\n  was therefore denied statutory procedural protections.\r\n  \r\nOn September 24, 1997, Donaldson \r\n  moved for summary judgment, seeking an order requiring Allstate to pay its limits \r\n  under the UIM provisions. Both Donaldson and Allstate submitted memoranda supporting \r\n  their respective positions. The trial court heard the motion on May 12, 1998, \r\n  over the telephone.\r\n  \r\nOn May 31, 1998, the trial court \r\n  signed an order denying Donaldson's summary judgment motion. In denying summary \r\n  judgment, the trial court in effect decided the case on the merits, holding \r\n  Donaldson's motion was procedurally misplaced and, further, Donaldson could \r\n  not recover UIM benefits because he had failed to provide timely notice to Allstate \r\n  of his action against Tixier.\r\n  \r\nI.\r\n  \r\nDonaldson argues he still has the \r\n  right to claim benefits under UIM provision of his insurance policy even though \r\n  he failed to serve Allstate with the pleadings in his lawsuit against Tixier \r\n  until after the trial. He contends he is entitled to this relief because: (1) \r\n  Allstate was served with the pleadings in the action while Tixier's post-trial \r\n  motions were still pending; (2) both liability and damages had been fully litigated \r\n  before a jury, with Tixier being represented by counsel for his liability carrier \r\n  pursuant to the carrier's right and duty to defend its insured; and (3) Allstate \r\n  did not have the right to participate in Tixier's defense until Tixier's liability \r\n  carrier tendered the policy limits of its coverage. We reject these arguments.\r\nSection 38-77-160 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code, which governs the liability of UIM carriers, provides in part as follows:\r\n  \r\nNo action may be brought under the \r\n  underinsured motorist provision unless copies of the pleadings in the action \r\n  establishing liability are served in the manner provided by law upon the insurer \r\n  writing the underinsured motorist provision. The insurer has the right to appear \r\n  and defend in the name of the underinsured motorist in any action which may \r\n  affect its liability and has thirty days after service of process on it in which \r\n  to appear. . . . In the event the automobile insurance insurer for the putative \r\n  at-fault insured chooses to settle in part the claims against its insured by \r\n  payment of its applicable liability limits on behalf of its insured, the underinsured \r\n  motorist insurer may assume control of the defense of action for its own benefit.(3)\r\nThe requirement of service in the \r\n  above-quoted statute is absolute. Donaldson argues that, even though he did \r\n  not serve Allstate with the pleadings in his action against Tixier until after \r\n  the trial in that case, he should still recover UIM benefits because the statute \r\n  does not specify when the insurer must be served. We disagree. The intent of \r\n  the statute is that UIM carriers receive notice of actions in which they may \r\n  be liable for UIM benefits so that they can protect their interests.(4) \r\n  To allow service on a UIM carrier after that action has been tried would defeat \r\n  the purpose of granting the UIM carrier the right to \"appear and defend.\" \r\n  \r\nWe also agree with Allstate that, \r\n  even if it had the right to participate in post-trial motions or appeal the \r\n  judgment against Tixier, these rights would have been a far cry from the right \r\n  to protect itself during the early stages of the lawsuit. As a practical matter, \r\n  if, as in the present case, the plaintiff prevails at trial, the burden of persuasion \r\n  then shifts to the defendant on appeal, and only special circumstances would \r\n  warrant a reversal of the jury's verdict. Furthermore, even assuming, as Donaldson \r\n  argues, the litigation was full and fair and Tixier was competently represented \r\n  by counsel, Allstate was most likely excluded from pre-trial activities and \r\n  settlement negotiations and thus never had the opportunity to reduce its liability \r\n  exposure.\r\n  \r\nWe further hold Donaldson has misinterpreted \r\n  Section 38-77-160 with regard to Allstate's right to participate in Tixier's \r\n  defense. Although the statute specifically allows the UIM carrier to \"assume \r\n  control of the defense of [the] action for its own benefit\"(5) \r\n  only when the liability carrier for the underinsured defendant \"chooses to settle \r\n  in part the claims against its insured by payment of its applicable liability \r\n  limits on behalf of its insured,\"(6) the UIM \r\n  carrier always has the right to \"appear and defend in the name of the underinsured \r\n  in any action which may affect its liability,\"(7) \r\n  notwithstanding the fact that it may not have the right to \"control\" the defense.(8)\r\n  \r\nII.\r\n  \r\nWe find no merit to Donaldson's assertion \r\n  that the trial court should have granted his summary judgment motion based on \r\n  the doctrine of offensive collateral estoppel.\r\n  \r\nOnly a party to a prior action or \r\n  one in privity with a party to a prior action can be precluded from relitigating \r\n  an issue.(9) Although Allstate filed a notice \r\n  of appearance pursuant to Section 38-77-160 after receiving copies of the pleadings \r\n  in Donaldson's lawsuit against Tixier, the purpose of this notice was not to \r\n  intervene as a party in its own right but to reserve the option to assume control \r\n  of the defense in Tixier's name should the circumstances so warrant.(10) \r\n  Moreover, \"[t]he term \"privy,\" when applied to a judgment or decree, means one \r\n  so identified in interest with another that he represents the same legal right.\"(11) \r\n  Allstate, as Donaldson's UIM carrier, had \"rights separate and distinct from \r\n  those of [Tixier],\"(12) not the least of which \r\n  was its own independent right to a jury trial.(13) \r\n  Not only, then, was Allstate never a party to the suit, it was not in privity \r\n  with either Tixier or Tixier's liability carrier.(14)\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Smalls. Department appeals, \r\n  arguing the trial court erred in various evidentiary and jury charge rulings \r\n  and failed to grant its motions for a directed verdict, new trial, and judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). We affirm as modified.\r\n  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nEight-year-old Brittany was killed \r\n  when a pickup truck driven by Vincent Bussiere accidentally struck her early \r\n  one morning as she crossed a two-lane road to catch her school bus. Brittany \r\n  was taken immediately to a nearby hospital where she died of severe head injuries \r\n  two days later.\r\n  \r\nThe Smalls initially brought wrongful \r\n  death and survival actions against Bussiere and Bussiere's employer, T.F. Anderson \r\n  &amp; Sons, Inc. Thereafter, the Smalls filed an amended complaint adding Department \r\n  as a defendant. In their amended complaint, the Smalls alleged that Walter Parker, \r\n  the school bus driver, \"required school children along his bus route to cross \r\n  the highway from the side where their houses are to [the] side where the bus \r\n  would stop and pick them up before the school bus arrived at the bus stop.\" \r\n  The Smalls alleged state and local school district policies were violated when \r\n  the driver required the children to cross the highway before the bus arrived. \r\n  The Smalls claimed Bussiere was negligent in hitting Brittany and further, that \r\n  she would not have been out in the road absent the instructions of Department's \r\n  bus driver. \r\n  \r\nPrior to trial, Smalls settled with \r\n  Bussiere and T.F. Anderson &amp; Sons, Inc. for $100,000. Of this amount, $90,000 \r\n  was allocated to the wrongful death action and $10,000 to the survival action. \r\n  The case went to trial with only Department remaining as a named defendant. \r\n  The jury returned a verdict for Smalls in the amount of $600,000 for the wrongful \r\n  death action and $310,000 for the survival action. Because the jury found Brittany \r\n  eighteen percent negligent and Department eighty-two percent negligent in causing \r\n  the accident, the trial court reduced the verdict by eighteen percent, thus \r\n  resulting in an award of $492,000 for the wrongful death cause of action and \r\n  $254,200 for the survival cause of action. Upon motion by Department, the trial \r\n  court further reduced the verdict as required by the Tort Claims Act and awarded \r\n  $250,000 on each cause of action, for a total judgment of $500,000.(1)\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. New Trial \r\n  Nisi Remittitur or JNOV (Survival Action)\r\n  \r\nDepartment argues the trial court \r\n  erred in declining to reduce the $310,000 jury verdict in the survival action \r\n  to the amount of the victim's medical bills, $33,926.10, because there was no \r\n  evidence Brittany suffered conscious pain and suffering prior to her death. \r\n  Department contends it was entitled to a new trial nisi remittitur or JNOV. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n  \r\nA motion for new trial nisi remittitur \r\n  asks the trial court to reduce the verdict because the verdict is merely excessive. \r\n  See O'Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993). \"If \r\n  the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to \r\n  be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other influence outside \r\n  the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial absolute,\" not a new trial \r\n  nisi remittitur. Id. at 527, 431 S.E.2d at 556 (emphasis in the original). \r\n  The jury's determination of damages, however, is entitled to substantial deference. \r\n  See Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, Inc. v. Dutton, 311 \r\n  S.C. 56, 427 S.E.2d 673 (1993). \"The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi \r\n  is within the trial judge's discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.\" O'Neal, 314 S.C. at 527, 431 S.E.2d at 556. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"In deciding a motion for JNOV, the \r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party; if more than one inference can be drawn, the case must \r\n  be submitted to the jury.\" Gastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C. 565, 568, 503 \r\n  S.E.2d 712, 713 (1998). The jury's verdict will not be overturned if any evidence \r\n  exists that sustains the factual findings implicit in its decision. Shupe \r\n  v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 445 S.E.2d 651 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina survival statute \r\n  provides that a cause of action for injuries to a person shall survive the person's \r\n  death, with damages recoverable by the legal representative of the deceased. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (1976). Damages in a survival action include recovery \r\n  for the deceased's conscious pain and suffering and medical expenses. See \r\n  generally Baker v. Sanders, 301 S.C. 170, 391 S.E.2d 229 (1990) (ruling \r\n  that the Tort Claims Act does not preclude a survival action for conscious pain \r\n  and suffering and medical expenses when an injured person later dies as a result \r\n  of the tort). In addition, Â§ 15-5-100 authorizes recovery for funeral expenses. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-100 (1976). Brittany's medical bills totaled $33,926.10, \r\n  and her funeral expenses were $4,622.25. \r\n  \r\nDepartment contends Brittany never \r\n  regained consciousness and cites Croft&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Hall, 208 S.C. 187, \r\n  37 S.E.2d 537 (1946), for the proposition that recovery in a survival action \r\n  is limited to the medical or other out-of-pocket expenses absent proof that \r\n  the deceased consciously suffered pain. In Croft, the victim was seriously \r\n  injured in an automobile wreck and survived for about twenty-nine hours before \r\n  she died. Id. at 193-94, 37 S.E.2d at 539. The attending physician, nurses, \r\n  and others testified the victim did not consciously suffer pain after being \r\n  injured in the wreck. Id. at 194, 37 S.E.2d at 540. In contrast, \r\n  the victim's mother testified her daughter made \"terrible noises,\" jerked her \r\n  arms and legs while in her hospital bed, and opened her eyes several times when \r\n  she spoke to her. Id. at 194, 37 S.E.2d at 539-40.\r\n  \r\nThe Croft court discussed \r\n  whether any evidence existed from which the jury could reasonably find the victim \r\n  experienced conscious pain and suffering. Id. at 193-95, 37 S.E.2d at \r\n  539-40. The court concluded the \"factual showing thereabout was weak but there \r\n  was more than a scintilla of evidence tending to prove the point. The circumstances \r\n  of the wreck and the fact that [the] intestate survived the finally fatal injuries \r\n  for about twenty-nine hours, with some movement abed, point to the fact of suffering.\" \r\n  Id. at 193-94, 37 S.E.2d at 539.\r\n  \r\nHere, in support of its argument \r\n  that Brittany suffered no conscious pain, Department points to the testimony \r\n  of Brittany's father who stated his daughter was unconscious when he found her \r\n  and never regained consciousness. However, Brittany's father also testified \r\n  that when he first arrived on the scene of the accident, his daughter was gasping \r\n  for air and moaning somewhat. In the days at the hospital before her death, \r\n  Brittany's father apparently spoke to his daughter to let her know everything \r\n  would be all right. He testified:\r\n  \r\nAnd, during those three days I felt \r\n  like she did hear me. Whether she, she couldn't talk back to me or anything \r\n  but I felt like she heard me because she did have movement, she had movement \r\n  with her fingers. And her eyes were blank, they were blank. So I felt like that \r\n  she did hear me and she could hear me and I just tried to comfort her as much \r\n  as I could.\r\n  \r\nClearly, the testimony of Brittany's \r\n  father regarding Brittany's pain and suffering was somewhat contradictory. Therefore, \r\n  the issue was a question of fact properly left for the jury. See Vereen \r\n  v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 306 S.C. 423, 432, 412 S.E.2d 425, 431 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991) (\"If there is any evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude \r\n  a decedent experienced conscious pain and suffering, the issue must be submitted \r\n  to the jury.\"). We conclude the trial court committed no error in denying Department's \r\n  motions for a reduction in the verdict or for JNOV.\r\n  \r\nII. New Trial Absolute or \r\n  JNOV (Survival Action)\r\n  \r\nDepartment further argues it was \r\n  entitled to a new trial absolute or JNOV because the jury verdict of $310,000 \r\n  awarded for the survival cause of action was excessive, shocking to the conscience, \r\n  and could have only been the result of passion, prejudice, or caprice. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nA new trial absolute should be granted \r\n  only if the verdict is so grossly excessive that it shocks the conscience of \r\n  the court and clearly indicates the amount of the verdict was the \"result of \r\n  caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or other improper motives.\" \r\n  McCourt ex rel. McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 308, 457 S.E.2d 603, \r\n  607 (1995). \"The failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial absolute in \r\n  this situation amounts to an abuse of discretion and on appeal [an appellate \r\n  court] will grant a new trial absolute.\" O'Neal, 314 S.C. at 527, 431 \r\n  S.E.2d at 556.\r\n  \r\nAs previously noted, evidence existed \r\n  from which the jury could have determined the victim experienced conscious pain \r\n  and suffering. One cannot easily or with any mathematical certainty place a \r\n  value on the amount of a person's pain and suffering. We do not find the award \r\n  of $310,000 to be shockingly excessive in this instance, and we defer to the \r\n  jury's finding in this regard.\r\n  \r\nIII. Special Verdict Form \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDepartment contends the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in failing to submit a special interrogatory to the jury \r\n  which would allocate liability between Department and the pickup truck driver. \r\n  Department argues such apportionment is mandated by S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;15-78-100(c). \r\n  We disagree.\r\n  \r\nSection 15-78-100(c) of the Tort \r\n  Claims Act provides:\r\n  \r\nIn all actions brought pursuant to \r\n  this chapter when an alleged joint tortfeasor is named as party defendant in \r\n  addition to the governmental entity, the trier of fact must return a special \r\n  verdict specifying the proportion of monetary liability of each defendant against \r\n  whom liability is determined.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(c) (Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added). The trial court ruled that a special interrogatory was \r\n  not necessary as Bussiere and his employer had settled with Smalls prior to \r\n  trial. The court reasoned Department was the only remaining defendant before \r\n  the jury in the case and so there was no need for the jury to apportion liability \r\n  between multiple defendants. We agree with the trial court's determination that \r\n  the requirement in Â§ 15-78-100(c) for a special verdict form is not applicable \r\n  in a case such as this where only one named defendant was before the jury. See \r\n  generally Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 \r\n  S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995) (\"Where the terms of the statute are clear, the court \r\n  must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.\"). \r\n  \r\nIV. Entitlement to Set-Off\r\n  \r\nDepartment alleges the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to set off the $100,000 settlement paid by Bussiere and his \r\n  employer. Department argues the judgments should be reduced by the settlement \r\n  amounts: $90,000 for the wrongful death cause of action and $10,000 for the \r\n  survival cause of action.\r\n  \r\nWe recognize that because of the \r\n  procedural posture of this case, Department is precluded from the normal statutory \r\n  means of reducing its monetary damages. Although the Uniform Contribution Among \r\n  Tortfeasors Act provides that a release, covenant not to sue or not to enforce \r\n  judgment \"reduces the claim against the others to the extent of any amount stipulated \r\n  by the release or the covenant,\" the Act also provides that it is not applicable \r\n  to governmental entities. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-38-50,&nbsp;-65 (Supp. 1999). \r\n  Moreover, the Tort Claims Act is the exclusive remedy \"for any tort committed \r\n  by an employee of a governmental entity while acting within the scope of his \r\n  official duty.\" S.C. Code Ann Â§ 15-38-65 (Supp. 1999). As discussed above, however, \r\n  Â§ 15-78-100(c) is inapplicable in a case such as this and of no help in reducing \r\n  Department's liability.\r\n  \r\nThe trial court's jurisdiction to \r\n  set off one judgment against another is equitable in nature and should be exercised \r\n  when necessary to provide justice between the parties. Hawkins v. Pathology \r\n  Assocs. of Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  A set-off is not necessarily founded upon \"any statute or fixed rule of court, \r\n  but grows out of the inherent equitable jurisdiction\" of the court; therefore, \r\n  such motions are \"addressed to the discretion of the court--a discretion which \r\n  [should not be] arbitrarily or capriciously exercised[.]\" Rookard v. Atlanta \r\n  &amp; Charlotte Air Line Ry., 89 S.C. 371, 376, 71 S.E. 992, 995 (1911). \r\n  As the Hawkins court reasoned:\r\n  \r\nA nonsettling defendant is entitled \r\n  to credit for the amount paid by another defendant who settles. Powers v. \r\n  Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 156 S.E.2d 759 (1967); Vaughn v. City of Anderson, \r\n  300 S.C. 55, 386 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 1989). The Supreme Court explained, \"[t]he \r\n  reason for allowing such a credit is to prevent an injured person from obtaining \r\n  a second recovery of that part of the amount of damages sustained which has \r\n  already been paid him. Or differently stated, it is almost universally held \r\n  that there can be only one satisfaction for an injury or wrong.\" Truesdale \r\n  v. South Carolina Highway Dept., 264 S.C. 221, 213 S.E.2d 740 (1975). However, \r\n  the reduction in the judgment must be from a settlement for the same cause of \r\n  action. Ward v. Epting, 290 S.C. 547, 351 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1986) \r\n  (refusing to apply settlement for pain and suffering cause of action to judgment \r\n  in wrongful death action). \r\n  \r\nHawkins, 330 S.C. at 113, \r\n  498 S.E.2d at 406-07. \r\n  \r\nAs our supreme court has stated:\r\n  \r\n[T]he rule is almost universally \r\n  followed that one tort feasor is entitled to credit for the amount paid by another \r\n  tort feasor for a covenant not to sue. There is considerable conflict, however, \r\n  as to the proper manner of allowing such credit, that is, whether the credit \r\n  should be allowed by the jury in assessing the injured party's damages, or by \r\n  the court. We are convinced from a study of these authorities that the sounder \r\n  and preferable method . . . is for evidence thereabout to be excluded from the \r\n  consideration of the jury, and for credit to be given by the court.\r\n  \r\nPowers v. Temple, 250 S.C. \r\n  149, 155, 156 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1967).\r\n  \r\nIn Wooten ex rel. Wooten v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Transp., 326 S.C. 516, 485 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 1997), \r\n  aff'd as modified, 333 S.C. 464, 511 S.E.2d 355 (1999), the plaintiff \r\n  in an action under the Tort Claims Act settled with two defendants prior to \r\n  trial and dismissed one defendant during trial, leaving the Department of Transportation \r\n  as the only remaining defendant. The trial court reduced the verdict by the \r\n  settlement amounts with no appeal taken regarding the set-off. The concluding \r\n  paragraph stated: \"The trial judge correctly determined [the plaintiff] was \r\n  entitled to the entire verdict, less amounts paid by the two [settling] co-defendants.\" \r\n  Id. at 529, 485 S.E.2d at 126.\r\n  \r\nIn our view, a set-off is warranted \r\n  in this case. The jury's verdict represented the total amount of damages sustained \r\n  by Brittany and her parents. Because Bussiere and his employer settled with \r\n  the Smalls prior to trial, the jury only apportioned negligence between Brittany \r\n  and Department. Equity dictates Department be given a credit for the amount \r\n  paid by the settling parties and thus, a double recovery is avoided. The settlement \r\n  amount represents, in effect, the portion of total damages attributable to Bussiere. \r\n  A set-off under the facts of this case is not only equitable but it comports \r\n  with the legislative intent of limiting the liability of governmental entities. \r\n  See generally S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20 (Supp. 1999).\r\n  \r\nHaving found Department entitled \r\n  to a set-off, the question arises as to the method of effecting the credit. \r\n  The parties have cited no South Carolina cases addressing this point and our \r\n  own research reveals none. Since there is no South Carolina precedent, it is \r\n  appropriate to look to other jurisdictions to determine if the issue has been \r\n  presented and ruled upon. In Rittenhouse v. Erhart, 380 N.W.2d 440 (Mich. \r\n  1986), the Supreme Court of Michigan considered this exact question when it \r\n  heard three separate appeals dealing with the application of a set-off. The \r\n  court concluded, after a very detailed analysis, that the trial judge should \r\n  subtract any settlement amounts from the jury's verdict before applying the \r\n  plaintiff's comparative fault to reduce the judgment. \r\n  \r\nThe court reasoned that in these \r\n  cases the jury's verdict represented the total amount of damages suffered by \r\n  the plaintiff and that the comparative negligence percentages determined at \r\n  trial applied only to the parties at trial, not the settling tortfeasors. The \r\n  court explained:\r\n  \r\n[W]e hold that a plaintiff's percentage \r\n  of fault in these trials was determined only in relation to the defendants participating \r\n  at trial. Therefore, a plaintiff's comparative negligence should only be deducted \r\n  from that part of the judgment to be paid by the defendant who was the only \r\n  other party to a determination of fault. Prior to subtracting the plaintiff's \r\n  comparative fault from this judgment, the settlement between the plaintiff and \r\n  the nonparty tortfeasors should be subtracted. This settlement may, and presumably \r\n  will, be based, among other things, on an estimate of the comparative fault \r\n  of the parties to the settlement.\r\n  \r\nId. at 446-47 (footnotes omitted).\r\n  \r\nThe Michigan court's reasoning is \r\n  persuasive, especially in light of the fact that the juries in Rittenhouse, \r\n  as here, only compared the negligence of the two parties at trial and did not \r\n  compare the plaintiff's conduct against all possible tortfeasors. Applying that \r\n  analysis, we find the jury verdict should be reduced by the amount of the settlement \r\n  allocated to each cause of action and then further reduced by the comparative \r\n  negligence of Brittany. Finally, the $250,000 cap under the Tort Claims Act \r\n  in effect at the time of this action provides the final reduction.\r\n  \r\nWrongful Death  \r\n  Survival Action\r\n  \r\n$600,000 Jury Verdict $310,000\r\n (90,000) (Credit for settling \r\n  tortfeasor)  (10,000)\r\n$510,000 Remaining damages due Plaintiff \r\n  $300,000\r\n (91,800) (18% Reduction for comparative \r\n  (54,000)\r\nnegligence of Plaintiff)\r\n__________ ________\r\n$418,200 $246,000\r\n  \r\n(Cap applied) Cap of Tort \r\n  Claims Act (Did not exceed cap)\r\n$250,000 Judgment \r\n  Due $246,000\r\n  \r\nAs can be seen above, the trial court's \r\n  failure to provide a credit for the settlement has no effect on the amount due \r\n  for the wrongful death action because even with the credit the verdict exceeds \r\n  the cap under the Tort Claims Act. However, after giving Department credit for \r\n  the amount of the settlement and applying the percentages of comparative negligence, \r\n  we find the judgment in the survival action should be reduced to $246,000. Contrary \r\n  to Department's argument, it is not entitled to a set-off from the amount of \r\n  the cap because Smalls has not recovered all damages awarded by the jury and \r\n  application of a set-off in this manner would unfairly deprive a plaintiff of \r\n  the verdict. The jury found the total damages suffered by Smalls to be $600,000 \r\n  and $310,000. The amount of the settlement obtained from Bussiere together with \r\n  the amounts received from Department still does not rise to the full level of \r\n  damages awarded by the jury. Therefore, Smalls has not obtained a double recovery, \r\n  and we see no equitable reason to apply the credit in the manner urged by Department. \r\n  See Truesdale v. South Carolina Highway Dep't, 264 S.C. 221, 213 \r\n  S.E.2d 740 (1975) (deducting the amount of settlement from the damages award \r\n  before further reducing the award to the statutory cap), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by McCall&nbsp;v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nV.  Exclusion \r\n  of Evidence\r\n  \r\nDepartment argues the trial court \r\n  abused its discretion in not allowing the testimony of trooper William Lynn \r\n  and accident reconstructionist Ronald Kirk, as well as related evidence.\r\n  \r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence \r\n  rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be \r\n  reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Gamble v. International \r\n  Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996).\r\n  \r\nA. Sketch. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDepartment contends the court erred \r\n  in excluding a sketch of the accident scene prepared by Trooper Lynn, the investigating \r\n  officer. The sketch purported to show the location of accident debris. Asserting \r\n  the sketch indicated debris was found outside Bussiere's lane of travel, Department \r\n  argues a jury could conclude that Bussiere crossed the center line and struck \r\n  the victim in the opposite lane of travel.\r\n  \r\nTrooper Lynn testified that because \r\n  cars were traveling down the road and scattering the accident debris, he could \r\n  not determine the exact point of impact. Trooper Lynn actually witnessed one \r\n  car run over a piece of debris, kicking it over into the opposite lane. His \r\n  proffered testimony revealed he returned to the scene at a later time and found \r\n  additional debris in the driver's lane not marked on the sketch. The sketch, \r\n  as proffered, shows only a few dots to indicate debris in one lane. The trial \r\n  court ruled the sketch inadmissible. \r\n  \r\nIt is clear from Trooper Lynn's testimony \r\n  that cars driving over the debris scattered the debris across the road. Further, \r\n  nothing in the evidence presented at trial indicated Bussiere had crossed the \r\n  center line and struck the victim. The trial court specifically stated that \r\n  use of the sketch in an attempt to prove Bussiere crossed the center line and \r\n  struck the victim was purely speculative. We agree and find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the trial court's exclusion of the sketch.\r\n  \r\nB. Photograph. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDepartment also asserts the trial \r\n  court erred in not allowing a photograph of Bussiere's truck \"for the purpose \r\n  of showing that Bussiere could have easily avoided this accident by swerving \r\n  a short distance to his right.\" Department contends the photograph showed Bussiere's \r\n  truck struck the victim on the far left corner, but its conclusory argument \r\n  does not indicate how the photograph would demonstrate Bussiere could have avoided \r\n  the accident. Other testimony presented at trial described the damage to the \r\n  truck as being on the front corner of the driver's side. We do not find the \r\n  trial court abused its discretion in not allowing the photograph under these \r\n  circumstances. \r\n  \r\nC. Ronald Kirk's Testimony.\r\n  \r\nDepartment alleges the court erred \r\n  in failing to allow Kirk, an accident reconstruction expert, to \r\n  testify as to the distance Bussiere would have traveled from the time Brittany \r\n  Smalls was last seen on the house side of the road to where the point of collision, \r\n  how long it would have taken Bussiere to travel this distance and thus the minimal \r\n  amount of time the deceased would have had to see Bussiere's vehicle and not \r\n  enter upon the roadway and how long Bussiere would have to see the deceased, \r\n  react to her [presence], and steer clear of the collision. \r\n  \r\nEssentially, the proffered testimony \r\n  represented that Bussiere should have seen Brittany in the road sooner than \r\n  he did and could have swerved to the right to avoid hitting her. On cross-examination, \r\n  however, Kirk admitted that without knowing how fast Brittany was running, he \r\n  could not state with any degree of scientific certainty how long Bussiere would \r\n  have had to react nor whether Bussiere had time to avoid hitting Brittany. Rather, \r\n  Kirk estimated that Bussiere would have had time to stop if he had perceived \r\n  Brittany as a potential hazard. The court found the testimony inadmissible for \r\n  its stated purpose. The court noted that the uncontradicted evidence showed \r\n  Bussiere was going 35 m.p.h., the view of the road was unobstructed, and that \r\n  he saw her from a distance of ten to fifteen feet. We find no error in the exclusion \r\n  of this testimony. \r\n  \r\nVI. Videotape \r\n  of the Accident Scene and Testimony of Gene Staulcup\r\nDepartment also argues the trial \r\n  court erred in excluding a videotape of the accident scene taken by Gene Staulcup \r\n  as well as his and Trooper Lynn's related testimony about the tape. Department \r\n  alleges the tape would have shown that Brittany had a clear view of Bussiere's \r\n  pickup truck, that the truck could not have been mistaken for a school bus, \r\n  and the amount of time she would have had to view the truck and react to it. \r\n  It further asserts \"[a] viewing of the video tape by the jury was critical to \r\n  the Defendant's comparative negligence defense\" so that the jury could assess \r\n  Brittany's relative negligence.\r\n  \r\nStaulcup recorded a videotape of \r\n  a colleague driving a 1988 Dodge Ram pickup truck down the same road where the \r\n  accident occurred. Staulcup recorded the truck traveling at about 35, 45, and \r\n  55 m.p.h. The tape was made early in the morning to approximate the time and \r\n  light conditions on the date of the accident. However, the tape was made on \r\n  October 2, 1997, some twenty months after the accident of January&nbsp;25, 1996. \r\n  Further, the truck driven by Bussiere was a white 1986 Isuzu pickup, not a Dodge \r\n  Ram. \r\n  \r\nAlthough counsel for the Smalls stipulated \r\n  to many of the conditions of the re-creation, counsel argued that the video \r\n  was not a true depiction of the area and asserted that additional street lights \r\n  had been added since the accident occurred. Counsel further contended the negligence \r\n  of Bussiere was not at issue as he had settled and was no longer a party to \r\n  the action. On cross-examination, Staulcup admitted the colors in the videotape \r\n  were not true to life. For example, the tail lights appeared white in the videotape \r\n  although they were really red. He also admitted that as the truck rounded a \r\n  curve in the road, its headlights appeared to be one light, like a train, and \r\n  a viewer could not tell the type of vehicle approaching. Staulcup acknowledged \r\n  there was some difference between what one could see with the naked eye as opposed \r\n  to what showed up in the video and there was no depth perception in the video. \r\n  Upon further questioning, Staulcup conceded he did not know whether the headlights \r\n  on the Dodge Ram were as wide as those on the Isuzu, whether there was any difference \r\n  in the candlepower of the headlights on the two vehicles, and whether there \r\n  were any differences in the height of the vehicles and the spacing of the headlights. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court ruled the tape inadmissible, \r\n  finding the quality of the videotape insufficient to show what the victim may \r\n  have seen on the morning of the accident. The court specifically noted the colors \r\n  were not accurate and observed that a question existed as to whether another \r\n  street light had been placed at the scene. The atmospheric conditions, potentially \r\n  differing candlepower of the Dodge and Isuzu, as well as the wattage of the \r\n  bulbs also concerned the court. Based on these explanations, we hold the trial \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the video and related testimony.\r\n  \r\nVII. Testimony Regarding \r\n  Parker's Inability to Testify at Trial\r\n  \r\nDepartment contends the trial court \r\n  committed reversible error by refusing to allow the wife of Walter Parker, the \r\n  school bus driver, to testify that her husband could not appear in person at \r\n  the trial because of his medical condition. The trial court's refusal was based \r\n  on its belief that her testimony would inappropriately give rise to a sympathy \r\n  factor. Parker's deposition was admitted into evidence instead. \r\n  \r\nRule 32(a)(3)(C), SCRCP, provides \r\n  that a deposition may be used at trial in lieu of live testimony if the court \r\n  finds \"that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, \r\n  infirmity, or imprisonment[.]\" In Gamble v. Price, 289 S.C. 538, 347 \r\n  S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 1986), the trial court judicially noticed that one party's \r\n  medical expert was unable to attend due to infirmity. We held the trial court \r\n  did not err, and relied on a former circuit court rule, now Rule 32(a)(3)(C), \r\n  which provided a deposition may be used if the trial court finds the witness \r\n  unable to attend the trial because of infirmity. We found the trial court did \r\n  not err in taking judicial notice of the witness's infirmity because it was \r\n  collateral to the issue of liability and not a basis for the judgment. In the \r\n  current appeal, the trial court permitted the deposition based on Parker's medical \r\n  infirmity. Department cites no authority for the proposition that the court \r\n  must allow a party to provide a witness to take the stand and explain the use \r\n  of a deposition instead of live testimony. Accordingly, we find no error.\r\n  \r\nVIII. Directed Verdict\r\n  \r\nDepartment next alleges the trial \r\n  judge erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict, new trial absolute, \r\n  or JNOV \"when the only evidence is that the deceased crossed the highway when \r\n  Bussiere was in plain view and the deceased knew not to cross the highway when \r\n  there was oncoming traffic.\" We disagree.\r\n  \r\nIn ruling on motions for directed \r\n  verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required \r\n  to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom \r\n  in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions. The trial court \r\n  must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its \r\n  inference is in doubt. This Court will reverse the trial court only when there \r\n  is no evidence to support the ruling below. This Court will not disturb a trial \r\n  court's decision granting or denying a new trial unless that decision is wholly \r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the court's conclusions of law have been controlled \r\n  by an error of law. \r\n  \r\nSteinke v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, ___ S.C. ___, ___, 520 S.E.2d 142, \r\n  148 (1999) (internal citation omitted).\r\n  \r\nAlthough there is no testimony that \r\n  Parker directly told Brittany to cross the road, at trial several students who \r\n  rode the bus with Brittany testified that Parker instructed them to cross the \r\n  street and be waiting for the bus when it arrived or be left behind. There was \r\n  other testimony that Parker had, in fact, been known to leave children behind. \r\n  Because the record reflects the existence of evidence to support the jury's \r\n  decision, we affirm the denial of Department's motions.\r\n  \r\nIX. Jury Instructions\r\n  \r\nDepartment submitted jury instructions \r\n  that explained a negligent act could be so remote in time as not to be a proximate \r\n  cause of the resulting injury and that Bussiere had a duty not only to observe \r\n  what an ordinarily prudent person would see, but to drive at a proper speed \r\n  and with proper lights when children were present in order to avoid a collision. \r\n  Department contends the trial court committed reversible error by failing to \r\n  charge the requested instructions.\r\n  \r\nIn reviewing allegations of error, \r\n  a jury charge must be construed as a whole and there is no reversible error \r\n  if \"'[w]hen the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition \r\n  and adequately covers the law.\"' Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. \r\n  Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 496, 514 S.E.2d 570, 574 (1999) (quoting State v. \r\n  Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 487, n.1, 445 S.E.2d 637, 638 n.1 (1994)).\r\n  \r\nHere, we find no error. The charges \r\n  sought by Department were essentially covered in the trial court's charge regarding \r\n  proximate cause. The court correctly and fully charged the jury on the relevant \r\n  negligence concepts applicable in this instance, and the failure to give the \r\n  requested charges does not constitute reversible error. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.

Rabb appeals the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Catawba Insurance \r\n  Company in her action to reform two insurance policies to provide underinsured \r\n  (UIM) coverage. She contends Catawba's offer of UIM coverage was not meaningful \r\n  because, at the time of the offer, Catawba was not authorized to sell such coverage \r\n  in amounts less than $15,000. We disagree and affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nDoris Rabb was injured in an automobile \r\n  accident on October 19, 1994. At the time of the accident, Rabb was a passenger \r\n  in a vehicle driven by her daughter, Karen Rabb. The two policies involved in \r\n  this action belonged to Karen Rabb, and Willie Rabb, the husband of Doris Rabb. \r\n  Rabb was not a named insured under either policy, and neither policy contained \r\n  UIM coverage, both policy owners having rejected such coverage in writing on \r\n  forms approved by the Chief Insurance Commissioner of South Carolina (Commissioner). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRabb brought this reformation action \r\n  against Catawba seeking to reform both policies to provide UIM coverage, claiming \r\n  that Catawba unreasonably and wilfully failed to offer such coverage.(1) \r\n  By way of an amended answer and counterclaim, Catawba sought a declaratory judgment \r\n  that it made meaningful offers of UIM coverage and Rabb was therefore not entitled \r\n  to reformation of the two policies. Catawba subsequently moved for summary judgment, \r\n  contending its forms made meaningful, effective offers of UIM coverage as matter \r\n  of law. \r\n  \r\nAfter a brief hearing, the circuit \r\n  court granted Catawba's motion for summary judgment. The court found that the \r\n  offers of UIM coverage were indeed meaningful and effective in that each form \r\n  includes language which was quoted with approval in this court's decision in \r\n  Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 462 S.E.2d 291 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995), and the supreme court's decision in Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., \r\n  323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996). In response to Rabb's argument that the \r\n  offers could not have been meaningful because Catawba did not have approval \r\n  from the South Carolina Department of Insurance (Department) for any premium \r\n  rates for UIM coverage in amounts less than the basic limits of $15,000, the \r\n  court found that whether such rates had been approved was irrelevant insofar \r\n  as both offers had been rejected. The court further responded that, had any \r\n  offer been accepted for which Catawba had not obtained approval, such approval \r\n  could then have been obtained from the Department. Finally, the court noted \r\n  that nothing prohibited an insurer from offering UIM coverage in amounts less \r\n  than the minimum liability limits without having obtained prior approval of \r\n  premium rates for such limits from the Department.\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if \r\n  the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, \r\n  and affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP. When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and \r\n  the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most \r\n  favorable to the non-moving party. Caf&eacute; Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, \r\n  305 S.C. 6, 406 S.E.2d 162 (1991).\r\n  \r\nThere are no factual disputes in \r\n  the case at bar. There is no question but that both Karen Rabb and Willie Rabb \r\n  rejected Catawba's offers of UIM coverage. Additionally, there is no dispute \r\n  that, at the time of the offers, Catawba had not sought or obtained approval \r\n  from the Department for premium rates for UIM coverage under the minimum $15,000 \r\n  limits which the Rabbs contracted for. Thus, this appeal must answer two questions: \r\n  First, did the form provided by Catawba and approved by the Commissioner make \r\n  an otherwise meaningful offer of UIM coverage? Second, if the offer was otherwise \r\n  meaningful, did Catawba's failure to have advance approval for premium rates \r\n  for UIM coverage under the minimum $15,000 limits render the offer ineffective?\r\n  \r\n\"Meaningful Offer\" \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. \r\n  1999)provides that automobile insurance carriers \"shall ... offer, at the option \r\n  of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured \r\n  liability coverage.\" This court and the supreme court have issued a number of \r\n  opinions addressing this statutory mandate. The provision has been interpreted \r\n  to require that underinsured motorist coverage in any amount up to the insured's \r\n  liability coverage must be offered to a policyholder. See Garris \r\n  v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 311 S.E.2d 723 (1984). Additionally, \r\n  in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d \r\n  555 (1987), the supreme court formulated a four element test for determining \r\n  whether an insurer has complied with its duty to offer optional coverages: (1) \r\n  the insurer's notification process must be commercially reasonable, whether \r\n  oral or in writing; (2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage \r\n  and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms; (3) the insurer must \r\n  intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and \r\n  (4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional \r\n  premium. If the insurer fails to comply with this duty, the policy will be reformed, \r\n  by operation of law, to include UIM coverage up to the limits of liability insurance \r\n  carried by the insured. Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475 S.E.2d at 760 (citing \r\n  Dewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 296 S.C. 150, 370 S.E.2d 915 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988)).\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (Supp. \r\n  1999), apparently passed in response to Wannamaker, provides requirements \r\n  for forms used in making offers of optional insurance coverage like UIM coverage \r\n  including:\r\n(1) a brief and concise explanation \r\n  of the coverage,\r\n(2) a list of available limits and \r\n  the range of premiums for the limits,\r\n(3) space for the insured to mark \r\n  whether the insured chooses to accept or reject the coverage, and a space to \r\n  select the limits of coverage desired,\r\n(4) a space for the insured to sign \r\n  the form, acknowledging that the optional coverage has been offered, and\r\n(5) the mailing address and telephone \r\n  number of the Department, so that the insured may contact it with any questions \r\n  that the insurance agent is unable to answer.\r\nAdditionally, subsection (B) provides \r\n  that:\r\n  \r\nIf this form is properly completed \r\n  and executed by the named insured it is conclusively presumed that there was \r\n  an informed, knowing selection of coverage and neither the insurance company \r\n  nor any insurance agent has any liability to the named insured or any other \r\n  insured under the policy for the insured's failure to purchase any optional \r\n  coverage or higher limits.(2)\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (Supp. \r\n  1999) (emphasis added).  \r\nThe form at issue in this case clearly \r\n  complies with each of these requirements. However, compliance with these requirements \r\n  does not satisfy the requirement of an offer \"up to the limits\" of liability \r\n  coverage as required by Â§ 38-77-160. See Osborne, 319 S.C. at \r\n  488, 462 S.E.2d at 296. Moreover, just because the form has been approved by \r\n  the Commissioner, as is the case here, the insurer has not necessarily passed \r\n  the \"meaningful offer\" test. See Wilkes v. Freeman, 334 S.C. \r\n  206, 211, 512 S.E.2d 530, 533 (Ct. App. 1999), cert. denied, Aug. 23, \r\n  1999. \r\n  \r\nIn Butler, the supreme court \r\n  favorably quoted the following language, also approved by this court in Osborne, \r\n  as satisfying the requirements of a meaningful offer of UIM coverage up to the \r\n  limits of liability coverage:\r\n  \r\nSome of the more commonly sold limits \r\n  of underinsured motorist coverage, together with the additional premiums you \r\n  will be charged, are shown upon this Form. If there are other limits in which \r\n  you are interested, but which are not shown upon this Form, then fill in those \r\n  limits. If your insurance company is allowed to market those limits within this \r\n  State, your insurance agent will fill-in the amount of increased premium. \r\n  \r\n323 S.C. at 408, 475 S.E.2d at 761. \r\n  The form in the present case, after presenting a number of split limit and single \r\n  limit UIM coverage amounts and their accompanying premium costs, provides blanks \r\n  in which to fill in a different coverage amount and blanks for the premium amounts \r\n  to be filled in. Additionally, the form contains the following options:\r\n  \r\nDo you wish to purchase underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage?\r\n  \r\nIf \"No\" is your answer, you must \r\n  sign here: __________________________\r\n  \r\nIf you do not answer \"No\", this coverage \r\n  will be added to your policy with limit(s) equal to your liability limit(s) \r\n  unless lower limit(s) are selected. To select your limit(s), complete the following \r\n  statement: I want split limits of:\r\n$___,000/$___,000/$___,000 or a combined \r\n  single limit of $___,000.\r\n  \r\nClearly, the form provides the insured \r\n  with the opportunity to select coverage in any amount, including amounts up \r\n  to the limits of liability coverage. As such, Catawba undoubtedly made a meaningful, \r\n  effective offer of UIM coverage, requiring our first question to be answered \r\n  in the affirmative.\r\n  \r\nPrior approval of Department \r\n   \r\nIn response to the second question, \r\n  we first note that our research reveals no case in South Carolina addressing \r\n  this issue. In light of the factual background in this case, it need not be \r\n  addressed here either. \r\n  \r\nRabb correctly points out that S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-920 (Supp. 1999) provides that no insurer may make \r\n  or issue any insurance contract or policy except in accordance with \r\n  its filings with the Department as to approved premium amounts. It is undisputed \r\n  that, in this case, Catawba did not have filings with the Department for premium \r\n  amounts for UIM coverage below the minimum $15,000 liability limit. Therefore, \r\n  Rabb argues, any offer by Catawba of UIM in amounts less than this \r\n  limit is meaningless, entitling her to reformation of the two policies. \r\n  \r\nIn light of our analysis of the offers \r\n  at issue in this case, and the policy owners' explicit rejection of those offers, \r\n  this argument is unavailing. In the words of former Chief Judge Alex Sanders: \r\n  \"[W]hatever doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.\" McCall v. Finley, \r\n  294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987). We agree with the circuit \r\n  court that whether or not Catawba was authorized to sell UIM coverage in amounts \r\n  less than $15,000 is irrelevant since both named insureds expressly rejected \r\n  otherwise meaningful offers of such coverage.\r\n  \r\nThe circuit court's order is hereby\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and CURETON, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  Rabb's complaint \r\n  also contained a purported \"bad faith\" cause of action against Catawba for wilful \r\n  failure to offer UIM coverage. Because we find Catawba's offer of UIM coverage \r\n  meaningful and effective, we need not address this cause of action. \r\n2.  Subsection \r\n  (D) also protects the insurer and its agent from an \"action for damages on account \r\n  of the selection or rejection made by the named insured.\" While this began as \r\n  an action for damages, the issue on appeal involves reformation of the policy \r\n  as opposed to straight money damages. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3124","title":"State v.

The State appeals. We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nOn December 3, 1997, a highway patrol \r\n  officer stopped Jihad on Interstate 85 when he observed that the right brake/tail \r\n  light on Jihad's 1971 vehicle was not operating. The officer gave Jihad a verbal \r\n  warning and initially intended to allow him to proceed. However, the officer \r\n  determined that Jihad was acting in an odd manner and noticed several suspicious \r\n  indicators. Specifically, the officer noticed an overwhelming odor of Downy \r\n  fabric softener emanating from the vehicle, along with the presence of a number \r\n  of brand new air fresheners. Additionally, the officer saw a pile of dirty clothes \r\n  in the back seat, which he found inconsistent with the smell of Downy. \r\n  \r\nJihad refused the officer's request \r\n  to search the vehicle. The officer, however, based on the reasons stated above, \r\n  summoned a K-9 unit. When the search dog alerted to the passenger side of the \r\n  vehicle, the officer searched the car and found a black travel bag containing \r\n  approximately fifteen pounds of marijuana. The officer arrested Jihad and an \r\n  Anderson County grand jury indicted him for trafficking. \r\nOn June 10, 1998, the court held \r\n  a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of the drug evidence. Jihad argued the \r\n  evidence was inadmissible under the exclusionary rule for two reasons: (1) the \r\n  stop leading to the search was itself illegal, and (2) the officer did not have \r\n  probable cause to search the vehicle. After brief arguments, the trial court \r\n  granted Jihad's motion to suppress based solely on the lack of probable cause \r\n  for the stop. The State appeals this ruling.\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nEvidence obtained as a result of \r\n  an unreasonable search or seizure is inadmissible. See State v. Easterling, \r\n  257 S.C. 239, 185 S.E.2d 366 (1971) (citing Mapp&nbsp;v. Ohio, 367 U.S. \r\n  643 (1961)). An officer's decision to stop a vehicle generally is reasonable \r\n  if he has probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred. See \r\n  State v. Smith, 329 S.C. 550, 495 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing \r\n  Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996)), cert. dismissed as improvidently \r\n  granted, 335 S.C. 550, 518 S.E.2d 821, and cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. \r\n  619 (1999). Here, it is undisputed that Jihad's right brake light was not working \r\n  when the officer pulled him over. The State argues that because Jihad's vehicle \r\n  featured two \"stop lamps,\" the statutory provisions regarding vehicle safety \r\n  mandate that both lamps be \"maintained in good working order.\" We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs an initial matter, an understanding \r\n  of the various vehicle lamp requirements and the purpose or purposes they serve \r\n  is essential. To comply with South Carolina law, a motor vehicle driven in this \r\n  state must be equipped with at least one rear-mounted tail lamp which emits \r\n  a red light visible from 500 feet. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4510 (1991). Similarly, \r\n  head lamps are required on the front of all vehicles, at least one for motorcycles \r\n  and motor-driven cycles and at least two for all other motor vehicles. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4490 (1991). Both tail lights and headlights must be illuminated \r\n  \"from a half hour after sunset to a half hour before sunrise\" and during periods \r\n  of inclement weather or adverse environmental conditions. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4450 \r\n  (1991). Signal lamps or devices, on the other hand, are activated only in particular \r\n  situations, i.e., when the driver intends to signal other motorists, \r\n  either in front or behind, of some impending maneuver. Accordingly, both brake \r\n  lights and turn signals are encompassed in the phrase \"signal lamps and signal \r\n  devices.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4730 (1991). \r\n  \r\nA rear-mounted stop lamp, or brake \r\n  light, is a signal lamp which emits a red or yellow light actuated \"upon application \r\n  of the service (foot) brake,\" which \"may but need not be incorporated with a \r\n  tail lamp[.]\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4730(1) (1991). A stop lamp, therefore, \r\n  indicates a vehicle is slowing down or possibly coming to a complete stop. A \r\n  turn signal is a lamp or mechanical signal device \"capable of clearly indicating \r\n  any intention to turn either to the right or to the left\" which \"shall be visible \r\n  both from the front and rear\" of the vehicle. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4730(2) \r\n  (1991). All signal lamps and devices must be visible from a distance of 100 \r\n  feet. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4730 (1991). \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the officer initially \r\n  stopped Jihad for a broken right brake/tail light. Though these terms are technically \r\n  distinct, both appear in the record and are used interchangeably by the parties. \r\n  However, both the State and Jihad agreed below that Â§ 56-5-4560 governing stop \r\n  lamps is the applicable statute. We therefore focus on the statutory scheme \r\n  concerning stop, or brake, lights.(1) \r\n  \r\nThere is no doubt that at least one \r\n  stop lamp or brake light is required on all new motor vehicles sold or driven \r\n  in this state after July 1, 1949:\r\n  \r\nFrom and after July 1, 1949 it shall \r\n  be unlawful for any person to sell any new motor vehicle, including any motorcycle \r\n  or motor-driven cycle, in this State or for any person to drive such vehicle \r\n  on the highways unless it is equipped with a stop lamp meeting \r\n  the requirements of Â§ 56-5-4730.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4560 (1991) \r\n  (emphasis added). Section 56-5-4730 reads, in relevant part:\r\n  \r\nAny motor vehicle may be equipped, \r\n  and when required under this chapter shall be equipped, with the following signal \r\n  lamps and devices:\r\n  \r\n(1) A stop lamp on \r\n  the rear which shall emit a red or yellow light and which shall be actuated \r\n  upon application of the service (foot) brake and which may but need not be incorporated \r\n  with a tail lamp; and\r\n  \r\n(2) A lamp or lamps or mechanical \r\n  signal device capable of clearly indicating any intention to turn either to \r\n  the right or to the left and which shall be visible both from the front and \r\n  rear. \r\n  \r\nA stop lamp shall be \r\n  plainly visible and understandable from a distance of one hundred feet to the \r\n  rear both during normal sunlight and at nighttime and a signal lamp \r\n  or lamps indicating intention to turn shall be visible and understandable during \r\n  daytime and nighttime from a distance of one hundred feet both to the front \r\n  and rear. When a vehicle is equipped with a stop lamp or other \r\n  signal lamps, such lamp or lamps shall at all times be maintained \r\n  in good working condition. . . . \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4730 (1991) \r\n  (emphasis added). Despite the repeated statutory references to a singular stop \r\n  lamp, however, the State contends that such a reading leads to an \"unwarranted \r\n  and absurd result.\" We disagree. \r\n  \r\nWhen the language of a statute is \r\n  \"plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning,\" there is \r\n  no need to employ rules of statutory construction, and this court \"has no right \r\n  to look for or impose another meaning.\" City of Columbia v. American Civil \r\n  Liberties Union, 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1996). \"This Court \r\n  cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary meaning, \r\n  and may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or \r\n  expand a statute's scope.\" Id. at 388, 475 S.E.2d at 749.\r\n  \r\nHere, the statutory terms are clear. \r\n  At no point in the text of either statute regulating vehicle brake lights is \r\n  the term stop lamp pluralized. To the contrary, both Â§Â§ 56-5-4560 and 56-5-4730 \r\n  employ the singular stop lamp. This court simply cannot ignore such patent \r\n  and definite statutory language in order to force a construction not intended \r\n  by the legislature. See Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  777, 779 (1997) (explaining \"where a statute is complete, plain, and unambiguous, \r\n  legislative intent must be determined from the language of the statute itself.\"), \r\n  cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1145 (1998). The plain language of the statutes \r\n  indicates a legislative desire to require that every motor vehicle have at least \r\n  one functioning stop lamp or brake light.(2) \r\n  Indeed the State itself admits as much, stating in its brief that Â§ 56-5-4730 \r\n  \"merely sets forth the minimum requirements for 'signal lamps and signal \r\n  devices'\" employed on a motor vehicle. (Emphasis in original.) \r\n  \r\nThis view also is supported by a \r\n  review of Â§ 56-5-4490, which mandates head lamps on all motor vehicles. There, \r\n  the statute explicitly states that each vehicle \"shall be equipped with at \r\n  least two head lamps,\" at least one of which shall be \"on each side of the \r\n  front of the motor vehicle.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4490 (1991) (emphasis added). \r\n  We agree with Jihad that if the legislature had intended to require more than \r\n  one working stop lamp, it would have expressly stated its intention in the statutory \r\n  language of Â§Â§ 56-5-4560 and 56-5-4730, as it so clearly did in Â§ 56-5-4490. \r\n  Moreover, we believe our interpretation best comports with the rule that statutory \r\n  language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute. \r\n  See Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320 S.C. 213, 464 S.E.2d 109 (1995); \r\n  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 \r\n  S.E.2d 364 (1994). As noted earlier, a stop lamp or brake light serves as a \r\n  signal to other drivers that a vehicle is either slowing down or stopping, and \r\n  this purpose is fulfilled when just one such light is engaged. \r\nThe State argues further, however, \r\n  that the trial court's decision \"fails to give full effect to the apparent intent \r\n  of the Legislature in regulating the safe operating condition of vehicles traveling \r\n  on South Carolina's public highways.\" Specifically, the State asserts Â§Â§ 56-5-4410 \r\n  and 56-5-5310, in conjunction with the latter part of Â§ 56-5-4730, evidence \r\n  a legislative purpose to secure the public's safety.(3) \r\n  According to the State, therefore, the trial court's ruling \"creates an entire \r\n  class of equipment that may be legally used on a vehicle in an unsafe or defective \r\n  condition, simply because the equipment is in excess of the Motor Vehicle Code's \r\n  minimum requirements.\" In our view, this analysis simply begs the question. \r\n  There is no doubt these statutes apply to regulate the operating condition of \r\n  those equipment features which the law requires. Nothing in the language employed, \r\n  however, suggests an intent to regulate extraneous mechanical features not deemed \r\n  mandatory by the legislature. We thoroughly agree with the State that highway \r\n  safety is an important public good. We also agree that the \"foremost method \r\n  of enforcing traffic and vehicle safety regulations . . . is acting upon observed \r\n  violations.\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 659 (1979) (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\nThere is no dispute that Jihad's \r\n  vehicle had at least one brake light (on the left side) in good working condition \r\n  at the time the officer effected the stop. Because we find the statutory scheme \r\n  mandates only one functioning \"stop lamp,\" in this instance Jihad's vehicle \r\n  was in full compliance with all statutory requirements regarding rear vehicle \r\n  lights. Since neither Jihad's driving nor his vehicle transgressed any traffic \r\n  law, the patrolman's stop was unreasonable. Cf. Sikes v. State, \r\n  323 S.C. 28, 448 S.E.2d 560 (1994) (explaining that an officer must have a reasonable \r\n  suspicion of criminal activity to stop a car). The marijuana, as fruit of the \r\n  poisonous tree, is therefore inadmissable. See State v. Copeland, \r\n  321 S.C. 318, 323, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996) (\"The 'fruit of the poisonous \r\n  tree' doctrine provides that evidence must be excluded if it would not have \r\n  come to light but for the illegal actions of the police, and the evidence has \r\n  been obtained by the exploitation of that illegality.\") (citing Wong Sun&nbsp;v. \r\n  United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)). \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision \r\n  to suppress the marijuana is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCONNOR, J., concurs. \r\nANDERSON, J., dissents in \r\n  separate opinion.\r\n  \r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting): I respectfully \r\n  dissent. The majority holds the patrolman's stop of Jihad's car was unreasonable, \r\n  thus, the marijuana, as fruit of the poisonous tree, is inadmissible. I disagree.\r\n  \r\nI. RIGHT TO STOP\r\n  \r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees the \r\n  right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \r\n  against unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend. IV. Temporary \r\n  detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even \r\n  if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a \"seizure\" \r\n  of \"persons\" within the meaning of this provision. Whren v. United States, \r\n  517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996); Delaware v. Prouse, \r\n  440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). An automobile stop is thus \r\n  subject to the constitutional imperative that it not be \"unreasonable\" under \r\n  the circumstances. Whren, supra. The essential purpose of \r\n  the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of \"reasonableness\" \r\n  upon the exercise of discretion by government officials, including law enforcement \r\n  agents, in order to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against \r\n  arbitrary invasions. Prouse, supra.\r\n  \r\nIn contrariety to the conclusion \r\n  by the majority that \"probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred\" \r\n  is necessary before a traffic stop is permitted, I believe the constitutional \r\n  guideline in regard to a traffic stop is \"reasonable suspicion.\" The \r\n  majority cites State v. Smith, 329 S.C. 550, 495 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998), for the proposition that \"probable cause\" is essential. Yet, Smith \r\n  cites Knight v. State, 284 S.C. 138, 325 S.E.2d 535 (1985). In Knight, \r\n  our Supreme Court held:\r\n  \r\nAppellant argues the seizure of the \r\n  hatchet was illegal because the officer lacked probable cause for stopping the \r\n  vehicle. However, a police officer may stop an automobile and briefly detain \r\n  its occupants, even without probable cause to arrest, if he has a reasonable \r\n  suspicion that the occupants are involved in criminal activity.\r\n  \r\nKnight, 284 S.C. at 141, \r\n  325 S.E.2d at 537-38 (emphasis added). Further explicating the law of a Terry(4) \r\n  stop is Sikes v. State, 323 S.C. 28, 448 S.E.2d 560 (1994). Sikes \r\n  enunciates:\r\n  \r\nThe scope and duration of seizure \r\n  must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its \r\n  initiation proper. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d \r\n  889 (1968). In South Carolina, we have gone a little further by holding that \r\n  an officer may stop a car and briefly detain the occupants if he has a reasonable \r\n  suspicion that the occupants are involved in criminal activity.\r\n  \r\nSikes, 323 S.C. at 30-31, \r\n  448 S.E.2d at 562 (emphasis in original).\r\n  \r\nA police officer may conduct a constitutionally \r\n  valid traffic stop when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that either the \r\n  vehicle or an occupant is subject to seizure for violation of the law. See \r\n  Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). \r\n  As long as an officer reasonably suspects the driver is violating \"any one of \r\n  the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations,\" the police officer \r\n  may legally stop the vehicle. Id. at 661, 99 S.Ct. at 1400, 59 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 672. Reasonable suspicion is a lesser standard than probable cause and allows \r\n  an officer to effectuate a stop when there is some objective manifestation of \r\n  criminal activity involving the person stopped. See United States v. Sokolow, \r\n  490 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). Reasonable suspicion exists \r\n  when an officer can identify specific facts that, when taken together with rational \r\n  inferences from those facts, would warrant a person of reasonable caution in \r\n  the belief that the detainee has committed (or is committing) a crime. Terry \r\n  v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The propriety \r\n  of a stop must be viewed in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances. \r\n  See United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d \r\n  621 (1981).\r\n  \r\nNo further inquiry beyond the requirement \r\n  of reasonable suspicion is necessary or warranted. State v. Carlson, \r\n  657 N.E.2d 591 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995). Thus, if the specific and articulable facts \r\n  available to an officer indicate a motorist may be committing a criminal act, \r\n  which includes the violation of a traffic law, the officer is justified in making \r\n  the stop. Id. Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has concluded \r\n  an officer's subjective motive does not invalidate behavior that is objectively \r\n  justified under the Fourth Amendment. See Whren v. United States, 517 \r\n  U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996)(police officer may stop driver \r\n  for any observed traffic offense even if officer's motivation for making stop \r\n  is unrelated to observed traffic offense). To satisfy the reasonable suspicion \r\n  standard, the State is not required to prove the suspected motor vehicle violation \r\n  occurred. State v. Williamson, 650 A.2d 348 (N.J. 1994). See also \r\n  Marben v. State of Minnesota, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 294 N.W.2d 697 \r\n  (Minn. 1980)(an actual traffic violation need not be detectable; all that is \r\n  required is that the stop be not the product of mere whim, caprice, or idle \r\n  curiosity).\r\n  \r\nThe reasonableness of the detention \r\n  is not limited to investigating the circumstances of the traffic stop. See \r\n  United States v. Johnson, 58 F.3d 356 (8th Cir. 1995). If, during the course \r\n  of the stop or as a result of the reasonable inquiries initiated by the officer, \r\n  the circumstances give rise to suspicions unrelated to the traffic offense, \r\n  an officer may broaden the inquiry and satisfy those suspicions. See State \r\n  v. Blassingame, Op. No. 3085 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 6, 1999)(Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 38 at 25).\r\n  \r\nA driver who commits a traffic violation \r\n  has a lessened expectation of privacy. New York v. Class, 475 U.S. \r\n  106, 106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81 (1986). Motorists are aware that, \"[a]s \r\n  an everyday occurrence, police stop and examine vehicles when license plates \r\n  or inspection stickers have expired, or if other violations, such as exhaust \r\n  fumes or excessive noise, are noted, or if headlights or other safety equipment \r\n  are not in proper working order.\" South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 \r\n  U.S. 364, 368, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3096, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000, 1004 (1976)(emphasis added).\r\n  \r\nII. SOUTH CAROLINA \r\n  STATUTORY LAW \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4410 \r\n  (1991), which is entitled \"Unlawful to operate unsafe or improperly equipped \r\n  vehicle, or to violate any provisions of article\", reads in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person \r\n  to drive or move or for the owner to cause or knowingly permit to be driven \r\n  or moved on any highway any vehicle or combination of vehicles which is in such \r\n  an unsafe condition as to endanger any person or property or which does not \r\n  contain those parts or is not at all times equipped with lights, brakes, steering \r\n  and other equipment in proper condition . . . .\r\n  \r\nPursuant to Â§ 56-5-4730, \"[w]hen \r\n  a vehicle is equipped with a stop lamp or other signal lamps, such lamp or lamps \r\n  shall at all times be maintained in good working condition.\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-5-4730 (1991).\r\n  \r\nSection 56-5-5310 provides:\r\n  \r\nNo person shall drive or move on \r\n  any highway any vehicle unless the equipment thereon is in good working order \r\n  and adjustment as required in this chapter and the vehicle is in such safe mechanical \r\n  condition as not to endanger the driver or other occupant or any person upon \r\n  the highway.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-5310 (1991).\r\n  \r\nIII. STATUTORY \r\n  CONSTRUCTION\r\n  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction \r\n  is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible. City \r\n  of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d 492 (Ct. App. 1997). All \r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative \r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, \r\n  and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of \r\n  the statute. Ray Bell Constr. Co.\r\nv. School Dist. of Greenville \r\n  County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998). The determination of legislative \r\n  intent is a matter of law. City of Sumter Police Dep't v. One (1) 1992 Blue \r\n  Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  \r\nThe legislature's intent should be \r\n  ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute. Stephen v. \r\n  Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996). The terms \r\n  must be construed in context and their meaning determined by looking at the \r\n  other terms used in the statute. Southern Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. South \r\n  Carolina Windstorm and Hail Underwriting Ass'n, 306 S.C. 339, 412 S.E.2d \r\n  377 (1991). Courts should consider not merely the language of the particular \r\n  clause being construed, but the word and its meaning in conjunction with the \r\n  purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law. Whitner v. State, \r\n  328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997). In interpreting a statute, the language of \r\n  the statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter \r\n  and accords with its general purpose. Hitachi Data Systems Corp. v. Leatherman, \r\n  309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992). Statutes must be read as a whole and sections \r\n  which are part of the same general statutory scheme must be construed together \r\n  and each given effect, if it can be done by any reasonable construction. Higgins \r\n  v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d 799 (1992). A statute must receive a \r\n  practical, reasonable and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, \r\n  and policy of the lawmakers. D. W. Flowe &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Christopher \r\n  Constr. Co., 326 S.C. 17, 482 S.E.2d 558 (1997).\r\n  \r\nIn applying the rules of statutory \r\n  construction to the statutes involved in the case sub judice, I come \r\n  to the ineluctable conclusion that the General Assembly's intent in enacting \r\n  Â§Â§ 56-5-4410, -4730, and -5310 was to provide for the safe operation of vehicles.\r\n  \r\nStates have a vital interest in ensuring \r\n  that vehicles are fit for safe operation. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. \r\n  648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). \"The foremost method of enforcing \r\n  traffic and vehicle safety regulations . . . is acting upon observed violations.\" \r\n  Id. at 659, 99 S.Ct. at 1399, 59 L.Ed.2d at 671. Vehicle stops for \r\n  traffic violations occur countless times each day. Id. \"Many violations \r\n  of minimum vehicle-safety requirements are observable, and something can be \r\n  done about them by the observing officer, directly and immediately.\" Id. \r\n  at 660, 99 S.Ct. at 1399, 59 L.Ed.2d at 672.\r\n  \r\nI reject the notion that this vehicle \r\n  stop should be analyzed under a hypertechnical review of Â§Â§ 56-5-4410, -4730, \r\n  and -5310. The first prong of Â§ 56-5-4410 has efficacy and viability. It stands \r\n  on its own in reference to vehicles the officer reasonably suspects may be \"in \r\n  such an unsafe condition as to endanger any person or property.\" The statute \r\n  relates to the overall safety factor in the condition of the vehicle. Pursuant \r\n  to Â§ 56-5-5310, it is unlawful for a person to drive any vehicle unless it \"is \r\n  in such safe mechanical condition as not to endanger the driver . . . or any \r\n  person upon the highway.\" If a police officer observes a vehicle he reasonably \r\n  suspects is a danger to the public or the driver, the officer should stop the \r\n  driver to inform him of the danger.\r\n  \r\nThe police activity undertaken in \r\n  this case should be reviewed under a totality of circumstances test involving \r\n  an analysis of the actual circumstances existing on the roadway as observed \r\n  by the law enforcement officer. See United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. \r\n  411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)(in determining validity \r\n  of stop, courts should consider totality of circumstances surrounding the stop).\r\n  \r\nIn a scholarly, after the fact analysis, \r\n  the majority dissects the statutory provisions with legal precision emasculating \r\n  the effectiveness of constitutional principles relating to a police officer's \r\n  right to stop. As a consequence of the decision by the majority, a negativistic \r\n  and inhibiting atmosphere will predominate in law enforcement traffic activities \r\n  rather than a commonsensical and practical evaluation of the vehicle and its \r\n  equipment while being driven on the public roadways in South Carolina. The egregious \r\n  result emanating from the holding of the majority is the imposition of a judicial \r\n  straitjacket upon the ordinary enforcement of traffic regulations. The interlocking \r\n  of a mandatory statutory violation with constitutional principles relating to \r\n  the right to stop negates the potency of recognizable precedent originating \r\n  from the United States Supreme Court.\r\n  \r\nOn a day to day routine engaged in \r\n  by law enforcement, the majority interjects reticence and reluctance because \r\n  of the fear of being adjudged wrong in a later analysis. The majority exceeds \r\n  the prophylactic protections provided by the right to stop principle and unjustifiably \r\n  implements mandatory requirements wreaking havoc in the public safety arena. \r\n  The salutary and salubrious enforcement of traffic laws in South Carolina will \r\n  now be infected by ambiguity and suppositional law enforcement responses. An \r\n  invidious and subtle atmosphere results from the ruling of the majority triggering \r\n  police trepidation in an ordinary traffic stop.\r\n  \r\nAdherence to the doctrine articulated \r\n  by the majority will mean that the police and appellate courts will have difficulty \r\n  deciding exactly when a vehicle can be stopped in a traffic stop scenario. Substantially \r\n  impeding the enforcement of the state's traffic laws by compelling the police \r\n  to decide traffic violations with exactitude eviscerates the public interest \r\n  in traffic safety. The majority imbues traffic enforcement with inherent compelling \r\n  pressures to know statutory provisions with specificity before a reasonable \r\n  stop can ensue.\r\n  \r\nHere, the officer had sufficient \r\n  reasonable suspicion, based on his own observation of the defective tail/brake \r\n  light, that Jihad had violated the traffic code. Thus, the traffic stop was \r\n  lawful under the Fourth Amendment and the evidence thereby discovered is admissible. \r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court's decision to suppress the marijuana.\r\n1.  In any event, \r\n  the outcome is the same. Section 56-5-4510 of the Code requires \"at least one \r\n  tail lamp\" on every motor vehicle. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4510 (1991). Since \r\n  we conclude that only one functioning brake light is also required, the distinction \r\n  is immaterial because the light on only one side of Jihad's vehicle, the right \r\n  rear side, was not illuminated. \r\n2.  Neither statutory \r\n  heading, \"Stop lamps required on motor vehicles,\" or \"Signal lamps and signal \r\n  devices,\" is inconsistent with this reading. Moreover, because they are not \r\n  part of the statute itself, such headings are irrelevant in statutory construction. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-13-175 (Supp. 1999) (\"The catch line heading or \r\n  caption which immediately follows the section number of any section of the Code \r\n  of Laws must not be deemed to be part of the section and must not be used to \r\n  construe the section more broadly or narrowly than the text of the section would \r\n  indicate. . . .\"). \r\n3.  Section 56-5-4410 \r\n  reads in relevant part:\r\n  \r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person \r\n  to drive . . . on any highway any vehicle . . . which is in such an unsafe condition \r\n  as to endanger any person or property or which does not contain those parts \r\n  or is not at all times equipped with lights, brakes, steering and other equipment \r\n  in proper condition . . . .\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4410 (1991). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSection Â§ 56-5-5310 similarly states:\r\n  \r\nNo person shall drive or move on \r\n  any highway any vehicle unless the equipment thereon is in good working order \r\n  . . . and the vehicle is in such safe mechanical condition as not to endanger \r\n  the driver or other occupant or any person . . . .\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-5310 (1991). \r\n  \r\n\r\nAs the State did not argue Â§ \r\n56-5-5310 below, it is not preserved for appellate review. See State \r\nv. Conyers, 326 S.C. 263, 487 S.E.2d 181 (1997).  \r\n4. Terry \r\n  v.

Barney Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n  \r\nPER CURIAM: Thomas \r\n  Kennedy appeals his convictions for first degree burglary, grand larceny, and \r\n  financial transaction card fraud arguing the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  evidence of other bad acts and in denying his motion to dismiss for an alleged \r\n  violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\n  \r\nThe charges against Kennedy arose \r\n  out of an early evening residential burglary and the use of an ATM card taken \r\n  from the home. On December 23, 1994, Sandra York left her home at approximately \r\n  6:15 p.m. Her son arrived home about 7:10 p.m. He soon discovered the master \r\n  bedroom was ransacked. Items missing from the home included cash, jewelry, two \r\n  airline tickets, personal papers, and York's ATM card. All items taken had been \r\n  inside the master bedroom. The value of these items totaled more than $16,000.00. \r\n  The front door showed possible signs of damage. Officers could not determine \r\n  whether the front door or a rear sliding glass door served as the burglar's \r\n  point of entry. \r\n  \r\nAt approximately 7:09 p.m. the same \r\n  day, someone attempted to use York's ATM card at a First Citizen's ATM machine. \r\n  A security camera taped the transaction, and Kennedy admitted that the still \r\n  photographs made from the video tape pictured him.\r\nThe Richland County Grand Jury indicted \r\n  Kennedy on charges of first degree burglary, grand larceny, and financial transaction \r\n  card fraud. Before Kennedy's trial on the current charges began, the trial court \r\n  denied Kennedy's motion to dismiss the charges on the ground he was denied his \r\n  right to a speedy trial. Further, the trial court allowed the State to introduce \r\n  evidence that Kennedy committed three other very similar burglaries, reasoning \r\n  the evidence was admissible to prove identity and a common scheme or plan, but \r\n  reserving a final decision until the evidence had been introduced. At the close \r\n  of the State's case, the court ruled the evidence was properly admitted as evidence \r\n  of a common scheme or plan and the identity of Kennedy as the burglar. \r\n  \r\nThe jury convicted Kennedy as charged. \r\n  He received a life sentence for first degree burglary, and concurrent sentences \r\n  of five years for grand larceny and one year for financial transaction card \r\n  fraud. \r\n  \r\nKennedy filed this appeal, arguing \r\n  the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the three other burglaries. Kennedy's \r\n  appellate counsel included in her brief on this matter a petition to be relieved \r\n  as counsel pursuant to Anders v. California,(1) \r\n  claiming Kennedy's appeal was without legal merit. Kennedy filed an Anders \r\n  response brief, arguing that his other bad acts argument has legal merit and \r\n  that he also believed the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss for \r\n  a speedy trial violation was reversible error. This court denied counsel's petition \r\n  to be relieved and ordered the parties to brief the issues of (1) whether the \r\n  trial court erred in allowing evidence of other bad acts and (2) whether Kennedy's \r\n  right to a speedy trial was violated.\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Evidence \r\n  of Other Bad Acts \r\n  \r\nKennedy argues the trial court erred \r\n  in allowing extensive testimony and other evidence concerning his involvement \r\n  in three other burglaries and related financial transaction card fraud offenses. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n\"South Carolina law precludes evidence \r\n  of a defendant's prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendant's guilt \r\n  for the crime charged except to establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence \r\n  of mistake or accident, (4) a common scheme or plan, or (5) the identity of \r\n  the perpetrator.\" State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 \r\n  (1999). See also State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923); \r\n  Rule 404(b), SCRE. To be admitted, evidence of other crimes must be logically \r\n  relevant to the crime charged. State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d \r\n  324(1998). Further, where the other crimes are not the subject of conviction, \r\n  they must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Id. In cases where \r\n  the evidence is offered as proof of a common scheme or plan, a close degree \r\n  of similarity or connection between the prior bad act and the crime is necessary. \r\n  Id. A general similarity to the charged offense is insufficient. Id. \r\n  The common scheme or plan and identity exceptions are interrelated, as evidence \r\n  of a common scheme or plan essentially goes to prove the identity of the perpetrator. \r\n  State v. Jenkins, 322 S.C. 414, 416 n.2, 472 S.E.2d 251, 252 n.2 (1996). \r\n  Where the close similarity between the charged offense and the previous bad \r\n  act enhances the evidence's probative value so as to outweigh its prejudicial \r\n  effect, the evidence is admissible. State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 433 \r\n  S.E.2d 831 (1993). \r\n  \r\nAt trial, the State presented evidence \r\n  that Kennedy committed similar burglaries at the homes of David Odle, Jack Pfeiffer, \r\n  and Dr. Tan Platt and that he used or attempted to use bank and credit cards \r\n  he took from these homes. \r\n  \r\nDavid Odle testified that on November \r\n  17, 1994, he left his home at approximately 6:10 p.m. and returned at about \r\n  7:30 p.m. after his girlfriend informed him she went to his home and found the \r\n  back door unlocked. The door's deadbolt had been pushed through the door jam. \r\n  Odle's wallet, containing credit cards, was missing from the kitchen area, which \r\n  was near the back door. A briefcase and some jewelry, including a gold pocket \r\n  watch, were taken from the master bedroom. The briefcase was later found outside \r\n  the house. One of Odle's credit cards was used later that evening at Rich's \r\n  department store to purchase a jacket and a pair of boots. Another of Odle's \r\n  credit cards was used at a Footlocker store the next day. Kennedy's fingerprint \r\n  appeared on the Footlocker store's copy of the credit card receipt.\r\nOn February 2, 1995 at approximately \r\n  6:30 p.m., Jack Pfeiffer and his wife left their home and went out for dinner. \r\n  Pfeiffer noticed upon returning home at 8:00 p.m. that someone had broken into \r\n  his house through the back door. He found that the intruder had rummaged through \r\n  the master bedroom. The burglar took jewelry, a hat, and a gasoline credit card. \r\n  Pfeiffer did not miss the gasoline card for several weeks when he discovered \r\n  an unusually high bill. He believed the card was left on a piano which was between \r\n  the back door and the master bedroom. The other items were taken from the master \r\n  bedroom. On February 22, 1995, a gasoline station security camera took photographs \r\n  of a man using Pfeiffer's card. A police officer familiar with Kennedy identified \r\n  him as the man in the photos. Kennedy's former girlfriend identified him from \r\n  one of the photographs as well. \r\n  \r\nOn February 7, 1995, police informed \r\n  Dr. Tan Platt of a burglary in his home. Platt received the news at 6:50 p.m., \r\n  only thirty minutes after he left home to walk down the street. It appeared \r\n  the home was entered through a window. The burglar took a jewelry box and a \r\n  humidor containing jewelry, as well as Platt's wallet, containing cash and credit \r\n  cards, from Platt's bedroom. A man was filmed attempting to use Platt's credit \r\n  card at an ATM machine around 7:30 p.m. on the evening of the burglary. Kennedy's \r\n  former girlfriend and a police officer identified Kennedy from these photos.\r\nDuring the course of the police investigation, \r\n  officers executed a search warrant on Kennedy's home. Inside they found a ring \r\n  identified by York as one taken from her house. They also found a pair of boots \r\n  and a jacket which matched the items purchased at Rich's with Odle's credit \r\n  card and a gold pocket watch which Odle identified as the one taken from his \r\n  home. \r\n  \r\nWe conclude the trial court properly \r\n  allowed evidence of Kennedy's involvement in each of the other burglaries and \r\n  fraudulent use of the cards taken from the homes. The crimes were very similar \r\n  to the crimes for which Kennedy was tried. Each of the four burglaries occurred \r\n  within a three month time span. The Odle and Pfeiffer homes were in the same \r\n  area of town as York's home. Each burglary occurred during a weekday in the \r\n  early evening hours between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m., the residents having all left \r\n  their homes between 6:10 and 6:30 p.m. In each burglary, the master bedroom \r\n  was the targeted room and only small, portable items were taken, while larger \r\n  items such as televisions and VCR's were undisturbed. Items which held some \r\n  of the smaller things taken from several of the homes, including safes, a briefcase, \r\n  and a humidor, were discarded outside somewhere near the residences. The stolen \r\n  credit or ATM cards taken from each home were used shortly after the burglaries, \r\n  and almost immediately after in the Odle and Platt cases, as well as the present \r\n  case.\r\n  \r\nWe find the evidence of the other \r\n  burglaries and credit card fraud was logically relevant to the crimes charged \r\n  and was proven by clear and convincing evidence. Further, the other crimes were \r\n  not of just a general similarity, but were so closely connected to the crimes \r\n  charged that the similarity enhanced the probative value of the evidence to \r\n  the extent that it outweighed any prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we find no \r\n  error.\r\n  \r\nII. Motion \r\n  to Dismiss for Speedy Trial Violation\r\n  \r\nKennedy was arrested on March 15, \r\n  1995. On March 12, 1996, he moved the circuit court for a speedy trial. While \r\n  awaiting trial, Kennedy remained in jail. When his trial began on May 19, 1997, \r\n  Kennedy requested the court dismiss the charges against him because his right \r\n  to a speedy trial was violated. Kennedy contends the trial court erred in denying \r\n  this motion. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments \r\n  to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 14 of the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution provide that a criminal defendant is entitled to a speedy trial. \r\n  State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 480 S.E.2d 64 (1997). In Barker v. \r\n  Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the United States Supreme Court identified several \r\n  factors to be used in determining whether a defendant has been denied the right \r\n  to a speedy trial including: (1) the length of delay, (2) the reason the government \r\n  uses to explain the delay, (3) when and how the defendant asserted his speedy \r\n  trial right, and (4) the prejudice to the defendant. Id. \"The length \r\n  of the delay is to some extent a triggering mechanism. Until there is some delay \r\n  which is presumptively prejudicial, there is not necessity for inquiry into \r\n  the other factors that go into the balance.\" Barker v. Wingo at 530. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court found the length \r\n  of delay, two years and two months, was troubling and sufficient to trigger \r\n  inquiry into the other factors. The court found the State's claim of a heavy \r\n  docket to be accurate but insufficient to excuse the delay. However, the court \r\n  was persuaded by the State's claim that Kennedy's case was quite complicated. \r\n  Further, even though Kennedy asserted his right to a speedy trial fourteen months \r\n  before the trial commenced, the court noted lead defense counsel had only been \r\n  counsel of record since September of 1996 and stated that the procedural history \r\n  of the case outweighed any presumption of prejudice. \r\n  \r\nAssuming that the twenty-six month \r\n  delay between Kennedy's arrest and trial triggers review of the remaining factors,(2) \r\n  we find no violation of his right to a speedy trial. While Kennedy asserted \r\n  his right to a speedy trial fourteen months prior to the commencement of his \r\n  trial, the case was clearly complicated and required substantial time to investigate \r\n  and prepare. Further, there is an absence of evidence in this case that the \r\n  State purposefully delayed Kennedy's trial. Finally, we conclude the prejudice \r\n  to Kennedy, if any, is minimal. \r\n  \r\nIn considering the prejudice Kennedy \r\n  suffered, we turn again to Barker v. Wingo for guidance. \r\n  \r\nPrejudice, of course, should be assessed \r\n  in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was \r\n  designed to protect. This Court has identified three such interests: (i) to \r\n  prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern \r\n  of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be \r\n  impaired. Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a \r\n  defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. \r\n  If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious. There \r\n  is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events \r\n  of the distant past.\r\n  \r\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. \r\n  at 532.\r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Kennedy argues that he \r\n  was prejudiced by his twenty-six month incarceration while awaiting trial. We \r\n  are unwilling, however, to hold that the prejudice he suffered by his pretrial \r\n  incarceration is sufficient to warrant dismissal of his charges for a speedy \r\n  trial violation. At trial, he alleged, because of the delay, he was unable to \r\n  locate two defense witnesses. He does not, however, assert this claim on appeal. \r\n  Further, when asked by the court how the delay affected his ability to locate \r\n  witnesses, counsel could only state he was simply unable to locate them.\r\nWhile Kennedy may have been slightly \r\n  prejudiced by the twenty-six month pretrial incarceration, the more important \r\n  question is whether he was prejudiced because the delay impaired his defense. \r\n  As noted by the trial court, there is nothing to suggest the delay caused the \r\n  witnesses to become unavailable. Rather, any delay should have only aided the \r\n  defense in its attempt to locate the previously unlocated witnesses. \r\n  \r\nUpon our review and balancing of \r\n  the Barker factors, we find Kennedy was not denied his constitutional \r\n  right to a speedy trial. Given the complexity of the case, supplying the State \r\n  with a legitimate reason for the delay, and the lack of prejudice to the defendant, \r\n  we conclude the trial court properly denied Kennedy's motion to dismiss based \r\n  on his assertion of a speedy trial violation. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Kennedy's \r\n  convictions for grand larceny, first degree burglary, and financial transaction \r\n  card fraud are \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1.  386 U.S. 738 \r\n  (1967). \r\n2.

The jury returned a verdict in the \r\n  parents' companion case against both defendants for actual damages in the sum \r\n  of $20,000, and against Rite Aid for punitive damages in the sum of $1,000,000. \r\n  Both defendants appeal. We affirm.\r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n  \r\nFacts Regarding \r\n  the Injury \r\n  \r\nOn February 20, 1995, Dr. Jan Shaw \r\n  diagnosed seven-year-old Gabrielle Hundley with attention deficit hyperactivity \r\n  disorder (\"ADHD\") and prescribed Ritalin. Dr. Shaw is a pediatric neurologist. \r\n  Peggie Hundley, Gabrielle's mother, took the prescription to a Rite Aid pharmacy \r\n  in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where it was filled that evening. \r\n  \r\nThe next morning, Mrs. Hundley gave \r\n  Gabrielle one tablet from the prescription bottle as directed. She then took \r\n  several tablets to Gabrielle's school with appropriate instructions to give \r\n  Gabrielle one tablet each day at 11:30 a.m. School officials administered a \r\n  second dose at 11:30 as instructed. Unfortunately, the Rite Aid prescription \r\n  did not contain Ritalin, but instead contained six milligram tablets of Glynase, \r\n  an adult medication used to treat diabetes. \r\n  \r\nShortly before 2:30 p.m., Gabrielle \r\n  had a seizure. She lost consciousness and was taken by emergency service personnel \r\n  to the hospital. She was in a hypoglycemic coma. She stayed in a coma for several \r\n  hours and remained in the hospital overnight.  \r\n   \r\nGabrielle's doctors determined her \r\n  coma was induced by her ingestion of Glynase. Glynase is a medication designed \r\n  to lower blood sugar levels in adult diabetics. It is not prescribed for children \r\n  at any dose, and a six milligram tablet is a high dosage, even for an adult. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccording to doctors, while Gabrielle \r\n  was in a hypoglycemic coma her blood sugar fell to a level at which her brain \r\n  cells, particularly the gray cells of the cerebral cortex, began using their \r\n  own proteins and lipids as fuel to avoid necrosis.(1) \r\n  As a result, Gabrielle suffered permanent brain damage. \r\n  \r\nExperts opined at trial that Gabrielle's \r\n  ability to learn has decreased since the incident, and she has not progressed \r\n  academically or behaviorally at her previous rate of progress. She has fallen \r\n  behind her peers despite extra help from her parents, tutors, and summer school. \r\n  Evidence indicated that Gabrielle's ability to care for herself has also decreased. \r\n  According to Gabrielle's parents, she can no longer manage personal hygiene \r\n  without assistance. She cannot fully dress herself, and she is unable to manage \r\n  clothing fasteners. She makes poor choices, endangering herself further. \r\n  \r\nIn addition to her brain injury, \r\n  Gabrielle was described as suffering mental trauma, including major depression, \r\n  post traumatic stress disorder, and separation anxiety disorder. At \r\n  trial, Gabrielle was categorized for the first time as mentally retarded because \r\n  of her brain injury. \r\n  \r\nThe two actions were tried together \r\n  beginning on October 7, 1996. During trial, the Hundleys' economist, Dr. Oliver \r\n  Wood, was allowed to base his opinions as to the present value of future damages \r\n  upon cost estimates contained in a Life Care Plan which was not admitted into \r\n  evidence. The Plan included a $4,727,641 cost for institutionalized care for \r\n  Gabrielle beginning at age twenty-one. \r\n  \r\nAfter the verdicts were rendered, \r\n  Jones and Rite Aid made post trial motions for a new trial, new trial nisi remittitur, \r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a review and reduction of the \r\n  punitive damage award pursuant to Gamble v. Stevenson.(2) \r\n  Testimony was taken as to the financial status of Rite Aid of South Carolina \r\n  in connection with this review. This appeal is taken from a denial of all post \r\n  trial motions.\r\n  \r\nSeeking clarity, we set forth the \r\n  remaining facts necessary for our decision in connection with our discussion \r\n  of the issues to which they pertain.\r\n  \r\nISSUES\r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial court abuse its \r\n  discretion in allowing expert opinion testimony under Rule 703, SCRE, as to \r\n  the present value of future damages based upon hearsay evidence of cost?\r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court abuse its \r\n  discretion in denying a continuance to the defendants?\r\n  \r\nIII. Does the inclusion of the $4,727,641 \r\n  cost for managed care require reversal of the actual damage award?\r\n  \r\nIV. Should the award of punitive \r\n  damages against Rite Aid be reversed because there is no clear and convincing \r\n  evidence of gross negligence in the mis-filling of Gabrielle's prescription?\r\n  \r\nV. Is the verdict as to punitive \r\n  damages inconsistent?\r\n  \r\nVI. Is the punitive damage award \r\n  so excessive as to constitute a violation of due process?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Rule 703 \r\n  Testimony\r\n  \r\nThe first issue raised by Jones and \r\n  Rite Aid is that the trial court erred in allowing the Hundleys' economist, \r\n  Dr. Wood, to include the $4,727,641 cost associated with future managed care \r\n  in his computations and ultimate opinion. This figure was included in a Life \r\n  Care Plan provided to Dr. Wood prior to trial. Although the plan was prepared \r\n  by a nurse with a master's degree, certified as a rehabilitation care specialist, \r\n  it was not admitted at trial and the nurse who prepared it did not testify. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nJones and Rite Aid assert that Rule \r\n  703 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence does not permit the admission of \r\n  this testimony. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nThe admissibility of an expert's \r\n  testimony is within the trial judge's sound discretion, whose decision will \r\n  not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Payton v. Kearse, 329 \r\n  S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998). \r\n  \r\nRule 703, SCRE, reads as follows:\r\n  \r\nThe facts or data in the particular \r\n  case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived \r\n  by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably \r\n  relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences \r\n  upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.\r\n  \r\nThe defendants argue the trial court \r\n  erred by allowing the expert, under the guise of Rule 703, to act as a \"conduit\" \r\n  for inadmissible hearsay. They contend the figures were not the type of data \r\n  relied upon by economists, but were instead foundational facts which must be \r\n  separately proved. In this regard, they reason that Rule 703 is subservient \r\n  to other Rules of Evidence.\r\n  \r\nDisposing of this latter assertion \r\n  first, we note that generally under Rule 602, SCRE, \"[a] witness may not testify \r\n  to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that \r\n  the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\" However, this rule specifically \r\n  states that it is subject to Rule 703. Consequently, we do not find Rule 703 \r\n  to be subservient, as argued by the defendants. \r\n  \r\nAn expert witness may state an opinion \r\n  based on facts not within his firsthand knowledge. State v. Hutto, 325 \r\n  S.C. 221, 481 S.E.2d 432 (1997); Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  793 (1996); State v. Franklin, 318 S.C. 47, 456 S.E.2d 357 (1995); Creed \r\n  v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 426 S.E.2d 785 (1993); James v. Lister, \r\n  331 S.C. 277, 500 S.E.2d 198 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied, March 5, \r\n  1999; Halbersberg v. Berry, 302 S.C. 97, 394 S.E.2d 7 (Ct. App. 1990); \r\n  Harris v. Campbell, 293 S.C. 85, 358 S.E.2d 719 (Ct. App. 1987). He may \r\n  base his opinion on information, whether or not admissible, made available to \r\n  him before the hearing if the information is of the type reasonably relied upon \r\n  in the field to make opinions. Halbersberg, 302 S.C. at 97, 394 S.E.2d \r\n  at 7; see J. Dreher, A Guide to Evidence Law in South Carolina \r\n  20 (Thames Rev.1979). Also, an expert may testify as to matters of hearsay for \r\n  the purpose of showing what information he relied on in giving his opinion of \r\n  value. Halbersberg, 302 S.C. at 97, 394 S.E.2d at 7 (citing United \r\n  States v. 5139.5 Acres of Land in Aiken and Barnwell Counties, 200 F.2d \r\n  659 (4th Cir.1952)). The admissibility of the testimony of an expert on a fact \r\n  in issue is largely within the discretion of the trial court. Id., at \r\n  97, 394 S.E.2d at 7 (citing South Carolina Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Bacot, \r\n  280 S.C. 485, 313 S.E.2d 45 (Ct. App.1984)). \r\n  \r\nDr. Wood rendered his opinion as \r\n  to the economic damages sustained by the Hundleys, which included the present \r\n  value of future medical and related costs. To render his opinion, he relied \r\n  upon cost information contained in the Life Care Plan. As to the costs associated \r\n  with future care, he testified that he could have obtained the figures himself, \r\n  but the information contained in the plan was of the type normally relied upon \r\n  by experts in his field in rendering an opinion. Based upon this foundation, \r\n  the trial court allowed the testimony. We see no abuse of discretion.\r\n  \r\nIn this case, the contested cost \r\n  components were not opinions of others. The information was easily ascertainable, \r\n  and would have been no less hearsay had the economist made the inquiry from \r\n  the health care providers himself. Indeed, we see no distinction between this \r\n  information and the other information necessary to a present day value calculation, \r\n  such as inflation rates, wage rate tables, and life expectancy tables. \r\n  \r\nWe find support for this conclusion \r\n  in our case law and in the case law from other jurisdictions interpreting Rule \r\n  703. In Creed, the appellant objected to a psychiatrist's opinion testimony \r\n  on the grounds that, in rendering his opinion, the psychiatrist relied on tests \r\n  and a report completed by a non-testifying neuropsychologist. Creed, \r\n  310 S.C. 342, 426 S.E.2d 785 (1993). The court pointed out that Rule 43(m)(2), \r\n  SCRCP,(3) which is identical to the Federal Rule \r\n  703, allows experts to give opinions based on facts or data which would otherwise \r\n  not be admissible, provided the facts or data are of a type reasonably relied \r\n  upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences in \r\n  the subject area. Ruling the evidence was properly admitted, the court stated, \r\n  \"[t]he reasoning behind this rule is that physicians make life and death decisions \r\n  in reliance upon information from numerous sources, including opinions and reports \r\n  from other doctors. The testifying physician's validation, expertly performed \r\n  and subject to cross examination, ought to suffice for judicial purposes.\" Id., \r\n  at 345, 426 S.E.2d at 787 (citing Advisory Committee's Notes for Fed.R.Evid. \r\n  703). \r\n  \r\nIn Franklin, our supreme court \r\n  upheld the admission of an expert's testimony based on facts or data not otherwise \r\n  admissible, quoting the Indiana decision Henson v. State, 535 N.E.2d \r\n  1189 (Ind.1989) with approval on this point: \"'[A]n expert's specific knowledge \r\n  is neither determinative of his qualifications as an expert nor of the admissibility \r\n  of his opinion into evidence, but bears on the weight to be given his testimony.'\" \r\n  Franklin, 318 S.C. at 58, 456 S.E.2d at 363 (quoting Henson, 535 \r\n  N.E.2d at 1193); see also Ellis, 323 S.C. at 121, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  at 793 (there was nothing improper in allowing respondent's experts to give \r\n  opinions based in part on the statements in medical records).\r\n  \r\nFinally, in Hutto, our supreme \r\n  court concluded that an expert's opinion testimony comparing a footprint found \r\n  at the scene of the crime to that of the shoe belonging to the defendant, based \r\n  in part upon a non-testifying expert's report which was not introduced into \r\n  evidence and in part upon the non-testifying witness's work raising the latent \r\n  shoe print on a business card found at the scene, was properly admitted under \r\n  a Rule 703 analysis. The court noted that the expert was not relying on any \r\n  subjective opinion of the non-testifying expert; the expert's opinion regarding \r\n  whether a match existed was totally his own. Hutto, 325 S.C. 221, 481 \r\n  S.E.2d 432 (1997).\r\n  \r\nApplying Rule 703, the court reasoned \r\n  that \"this evidence falls within a firmly-rooted hearsay exception and thus \r\n  reliability can be inferred.\" Id., at 229, 481 S.E.2d at 436 (citation \r\n  omitted). Quoting the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the court stated, \"'[e]xpert \r\n  witness testimony is a widely-recognized exception to the rule against hearsay \r\n  testimony.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Williams, 447 F.2d \r\n  1285, 1290 (5th Cir. 1971) (en banc) (1972)).\r\n  \r\nThe rationale for this exception \r\n  to the rule against hearsay is that the expert, because of his professional \r\n  knowledge and ability, is competent to judge for himself the reliability of \r\n  the records and statements on which he bases his expert opinion. Moreover, the \r\n  opinion of expert witnesses must invariably rest, at least in part, upon sources \r\n  that can never be proven in court. An expert's opinion is derived not only from \r\n  records and data, but from education and from a lifetime of experience. Thus, \r\n  when the expert witness has consulted numerous sources, and uses that information, \r\n  together with his own professional knowledge and experience, to arrive at his \r\n  opinion, that opinion is regarded as evidence in its own right and not as hearsay \r\n  in disguise.\r\n  \r\nWilliams, 447 F.2d at 1290. \r\n  (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nOther jurisdictions interpret Rule \r\n  703 in the same way. In Walters v. Yellow Cab Co., 653 N.E.2d 785 (Ill. \r\n  App. Ct. 1995), the Illinois Appellate Court held there was no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the admission of future medical cost estimates by the plaintiff's testifying \r\n  doctor, even though the costs were provided to him by his nurse and were based \r\n  on inquiries to other doctors at his medical facility, finding the situation \r\n  was contemplated by Rule 703. \r\n  \r\nIn St. Paul Med. Ctr. v. Cecil, \r\n  842 S.W.2d 808 (Tex. App. 1992), an expert testified to future damages based \r\n  upon tuition costs obtained from schools. The court ruled that under Rule 703 \r\n  the expert could properly base his opinions concerning those costs on the hearsay \r\n  data, noting the expert testified that he and other experts rely on costs obtained \r\n  from schools to prepare treatment plans. Consequently, the testimony was admissible \r\n  under Rule 703.\r\n  \r\nIn Steinhauer v. Wilson, 485 \r\n  A.2d 477 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984), the court ruled that testimony of an expert \r\n  in construction was properly admitted even though the expert based his opinion \r\n  on cost figures provided to him by various contractors with whom he had consulted, \r\n  finding it proper under Rule 703. Likewise, in Dixon v. Kedbetter, 561 \r\n  S.W.2d 294 (Ark. 1978), the court found the testimony of the expert, relaying \r\n  figures given to him by a non-testifying subcontractor, was properly admitted \r\n  under Rule 703 where the expert relied upon those figures to calculate the overall \r\n  cost of repair. In so ruling, the court noted:\r\n  \r\nThe test stated in the rule is whether \r\n  the expert's reliance is reasonable. It was not prima facie unreasonable for \r\n  the expert witness in this case to ascertain the cost of the required pieces \r\n  of sheet metal by consulting a supplier. . . . [T]he same cost figure could \r\n  have been shown by calling the supplier as a witness. That cumbersome procedure \r\n  is now readily avoidable; for the expert witness can be cross-examined about \r\n  his expertise in the matter and about the reasonableness of the supplier's estimate. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nId. at 296.\r\n  \r\nIn each of these cases, information \r\n  was provided to the expert and formed a part of the basis for the expert's opinion. \r\n  The information was of a type relied upon by experts in their respective fields, \r\n  and that reliance was reasonable. In this case, Dr. Wood testified that the \r\n  cost figures contained in the Life Care Plan were the type of information relied \r\n  upon by experts in the field of economics, and the court determined that reliance \r\n  to be reasonable. As to the medical necessity of the future care, there was \r\n  ample testimony from other witnesses to substantiate the basis for including \r\n  these elements of damage. Dr. Tidler, a board certified child, adolescent and \r\n  forensic psychiatrist, testified at length to Gabrielle's need for each of the \r\n  items included in the economist's computations. Based upon the above analysis, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in the admission of the economist's \r\n  opinion. \r\n  \r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we disagree \r\n  with the defendants' assertion that Dr. Wood was a \"mere conduit\" to introduce \r\n  evidence which had already been ruled inadmissible as hearsay. The defendants \r\n  cite TK-7 Corp. v. Estate of Barbouti, 993 F.2d 722 (10th \r\n  Cir. 1993); United States v. Tomasian, 784 F.2d 782 (7th Cir. \r\n  1986); Sims v. Safeway Trails, Inc., 764 S.W. 427 (Ark. 1989); and Falkner \r\n  v. Markkay of Indiana, Inc., 663 N.E.2d 798 (Ind. App. 1996) as authority \r\n  for this position. However, we find these cases readily distinguishable, because \r\n  in each of these cases the expert attempted to testify to hearsay which did \r\n  not form a part of the basis for a valid opinion. \r\n  \r\nIn TK-7 Corp., one expert \r\n  testified to the opinions of another expert as to potential future lost profits \r\n  of the plaintiff in a foreign oil market, without objection. However, the Court \r\n  of Appeals held that this testimony could not be considered as substantive evidence \r\n  of damages under a Rule 703 analysis because the testifying expert had no expertise \r\n  in assessing damages in a foreign market, and by assuming the sales projections \r\n  made by the non-testifying expert, he \"in essence assumed the very matter at \r\n  issue on which he was called to express his opinion.\" TK-7 Corp., 993 \r\n  F.2d at 732. \r\n  \r\n Likewise, in Tomasian, the \r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's exclusion of testimony by the defendant's \r\n  expert as to value because he had no opinion of his own, but could merely relay \r\n  another expert's opinion. As the court stated, \"Rule 703 does not sanction the \r\n  simple transmission of hearsay; it only permits an expert opinion based on hearsay.\" \r\n  Tomasian, 784 F.2d at 786.\r\n  \r\nIn Sims, the appellate court \r\n  affirmed the trial court's exclusion of an expert's testimony relaying what \r\n  his investigator had told him concerning the condition of a vehicle's brakes \r\n  as hearsay. The court noted that normally the inquiry into the admissibility \r\n  of this type of evidence would not stop at the conclusion that the proposed \r\n  testimony is hearsay because Rule 703 allows an expert to rely on facts not \r\n  admissible in evidence, but in the case at bar no further inquiry was necessary \r\n  because the data was not relevant to any opinion expressed by the expert in \r\n  explaining how the mishap occurred. \"[The expert] did not purport to have an \r\n  opinion as to how the collision occurred which was even remotely related to \r\n  the condition of the bus's brakes.\" Sims, 764 S.W.2d at 429.  \r\n   \r\nFinally, in Falkner, the plaintiff \r\n  appealed the lower court's refusal to allow the introduction of the opinions \r\n  of non-testifying surgeons through the testimony of a testifying chiropractic \r\n  doctor. The appellate court affirmed because the chiropractic expert did not \r\n  have the training or education in medicine to base an opinion on this hearsay, \r\n  and the chiropractor's testimony would have been merely a recitation of the \r\n  opinion of others. \r\n  \r\nIn each of these cases the evidence \r\n  was excluded because it did not meet the criteria set forth under Rule 703. \r\n  It was not information upon which an expert in the field would reasonably rely \r\n  in reaching an opinion and/or did not form the basis of the expert's own opinion. \r\n  Here, the evidence does meet the criteria set forth under Rule 703. Consequently, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling.\r\n  \r\n II. DENIED \r\n  CONTINUANCE REQUESTS\r\n  \r\nJones and Rite Aid next argue the \r\n  trial court abused its discretion in refusing their October 2 and October 4 \r\n  requests for a continuance. They argue that the late completion and discovery \r\n  of the Life Care Plan and the late change of Gabrielle's diagnosis by Dr. Venn, \r\n  from not mentally retarded to mentally retarded, improperly compromised their \r\n  defense.\r\n  \r\nThe pretrial proceedings, particularly \r\n  the course of discovery, provide important information which is integral to \r\n  the trial court's rulings and to this Court's disposition of this issue. For \r\n  that reason, we review them here.\r\n  \r\nOn March 23, 1995, the Hundleys filed \r\n  an action on Gabrielle's behalf and another on their own behalf, naming Jones \r\n  and Rite Aid as defendants in both suits. The complaints alleged, among other \r\n  things, that Gabrielle's damages included pain and suffering, emotional trauma, \r\n  and permanent physical and emotional injury. Jones and Rite Aid filed answers \r\n  including a denial of negligence and an assertion of comparative negligence \r\n  of Mrs. Hundley both as a bar to recovery, and, in the alternative, as a basis \r\n  for reduction of any damage award. \r\n  \r\nIn June of 1996, the Hundleys amended \r\n  the complaints to allege the negligence of Rite Aid in the hiring, retention, \r\n  and supervision of Jones as a proximate cause of Gabrielle's injury. Again, \r\n  Jones and Rite Aid filed answers denying the material allegations and asserting \r\n  the same affirmative defenses.\r\n  \r\nThe defendants filed and served the \r\n  Hundleys with \"Standard Interrogatories\" allowed under Rule 33 (b), SCRCP. These \r\n  interrogatories are limited in scope, and are intended to provide basic discovery \r\n  in all cases while not being overly burdensome to the parties. Thus, as pertinent \r\n  to the issues here, they placed upon the Hundleys a continuing obligation up \r\n  to the time of trial to:\r\n  \r\n(3) set forth names/addresses of \r\n  all treating physicians, and all hospitals to which the party has been committed, \r\n  together with all medical costs involved; (5) set forth an itemized statement \r\n  of damages claimed to have been sustained, not including pain and suffering; \r\n  (6) set forth the names/addresses of experts proposed as witnesses; and (7) \r\n  as to each person known to be a witness concerning the facts, set forth a summary \r\n  sufficient to inform the other party of the important facts known to or observed \r\n  by such witness, or provide a copy of any written or recorded statements taken \r\n  from such witnesses. \r\n  \r\nRule 33, SCRCP. Although Rule 33 \r\n  allows up to 50 additional interrogatories to each party where the amount in \r\n  controversy is not less than $25,000, no further interrogatories were served \r\n  upon the Hundleys. \r\n  \r\nThe Hundleys filed a Rule 36, SCRCP \r\n  Request To Admit upon Jones and Rite Aid early in the litigation, according \r\n  to the discovery order of Judge Hayes dated September 23, 1996, requesting that \r\n  they admit the prescription had been mis-filled. Jones and Rite Aid declined \r\n  to make that admission. Thus began the Hundleys' quest to uncover evidence concerning \r\n  the filling of the prescription. \r\n  \r\nAccording to the un-appealed final \r\n  order of Judge Hayes compelling discovery, the Hundleys first served interrogatories \r\n  and requests for production upon Jones and Rite Aid on July 14, 1995. These \r\n  interrogatories went unanswered, and 3Â½ months later the Hundleys filed a motion \r\n  to compel. On the eve of the hearing, the defendants agreed to comply with discovery \r\n  and to consent to an order compelling compliance, so the hearing was canceled. \r\n  Notwithstanding the agreement, the defendants did not sign the consent order \r\n  or comply with discovery.  \r\n\r\nOn January 17 and February 8, 1996, \r\n  partial answers to interrogatories were provided by the defendants. On April \r\n  22, 1996, the Hundleys filed another motion to compel responses to the first \r\n  interrogatories and requests for production, as well as to compel responses \r\n  to the second set of interrogatories which had been served on February 2, 1996. \r\n  By the time of the hearing on the motion scheduled for April 30, 1996, the defendants \r\n  were also overdue in their responses to a third set of discovery requests. The \r\n  court ordered defendants' full compliance by May 15, 1996, or suffer the ultimate \r\n  sanction of striking the answer and entering a default judgment.\r\nThe defendants provided their next \r\n  written responses to discovery on May 14 and 15, 1996, and they are most notable \r\n  because the defendants represented that computer data and other pharmaceutical \r\n  records required to be kept by law could not be located or retrieved. See \r\n  S.C. Code Regs. 99-27 (Supp. 1999). They further represented that no 6 milligram \r\n  Glynase tablets had been dispensed by the Rock Hill pharmacy in question (store \r\n  1124) during the three month time period surrounding this incident. \r\n  \r\nOn July 9, Judge Hayes again ordered \r\n  the defendants to produce the original slips regarding prescriptions filled \r\n  by Rite Aid during the time in question by 5:00 P.M. on August 16, 1996, or \r\n  suffer the consequence of striking the defendants' answer. In the same July \r\n  9 order compelling discovery, the court required Rite Aid to once more answer \r\n  the interrogatories regarding the dispensing of Glynase and the unavailability \r\n  of computer records documenting the prescription activities at the store. This \r\n  time the court required that the answers be certified by a senior Rite Aid corporate \r\n  officer.\r\n  \r\nThe missing computer records were \r\n  then located by Rite Aid. Contrary to their prior sworn answers, these records \r\n  established that Glynase had indeed been sold at the Rock Hill store during \r\n  the same time period as the Ritalin prescription for Gabrielle. The Glynase \r\n  prescription was for the exact dosage and number of tablets which Mrs. Hundley \r\n  reported receiving as Ritalin. The prescription slips were also produced, but \r\n  the two most relevant records were mysteriously missing - the Hundley Ritalin \r\n  prescription and the 80 tablet, 6 milligram, Glynase prescription. Unlike the \r\n  computer records, the prescription slips could not be altered. These revelations \r\n  were divulged after the next motion to compel, on August 15, 1996, less than \r\n  two months before trial. \r\n  \r\nDuring this same time period, the \r\n  Hundleys noticed the depositions of five Rite Aid employees for July 10 and \r\n  11, 1996, and Rite Aid's named treasurer and South Carolina registrant for service \r\n  of process for July 17, 1996. On July 9, Rite Aid requested postponement of \r\n  the depositions. By agreement, they were postponed until July 23 and 26, 1996. \r\n  However, after the time for commencement of the depositions on July 23, Rite \r\n  Aid first notified the Hundleys that no witnesses would be produced, \r\n  and several were no longer employed by Rite Aid and had not been so employed \r\n  since the summer of 1995. The Hundleys were informed that Rite Aid's treasurer \r\n  and registrant refused to travel from Pennsylvania to South Carolina for the \r\n  taking of his scheduled deposition, even though no timely objection had been \r\n  interposed.\r\n  \r\nAgain, the Hundleys filed a motion \r\n  to compel which was heard on August 15, 1996. The court concluded that any objection \r\n  to the place of deposition had been waived, and furthermore, that the treasurer \r\n  and registrant was a managing agent subject to deposition in South Carolina. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe discovery abuse was not finished. \r\n  The Hundleys sought records of the relationship between Rite Aid of South Carolina, \r\n  Inc. and Rite Aid Corporation (the parent corporation), in order to analyze \r\n  whether the two were separate corporate entities and to understand their financial \r\n  interrelationship, surmising it might relate to the ability of Rite Aid of South \r\n  Carolina to respond to punitive damages. There has been no appeal of the order \r\n  compelling this discovery, yet even by the time of trial, during trial, and \r\n  post trial, Rite Aid has refused without explanation to produce the requested \r\n  documents. As a result, the trial court charged the jury that if they determined \r\n  the Hundleys had proved a right to punitive damages against Rite Aid, they need \r\n  not consider Rite Aid's ability to pay punitive damages, because as a matter \r\n  of law, Rite Aid could afford to pay them. There was no contemporaneous objection \r\n  to this charge, and there is no appeal from it.\r\n  \r\nIn the last pretrial order related \r\n  to the Hundleys' motions to compel discovery, dated less than a month before \r\n  trial, the court ordered Rite Aid to pay the Hundleys' expenses caused by Rite \r\n  Aid's conduct and a $10,000 fine to the court. After outlining Rite Aid's various \r\n  discovery abuses, the court stated:\r\n  \r\nThe above litany of the conduct of \r\n  Defendant throughout this litigation reveals a clear pattern of abusive and \r\n  obstructionist behavior.[(4)] It is \r\n  obvious to this Court that a great deal of Plaintiffs' discovery and preparation \r\n  in this case has been aimed toward establishing the fact of the mis-fill and \r\n  the manner in which it occurred. Plaintiff early on in the li[ti]gation requested \r\n  that Defendant admit that the mis-fill had occurred, and pursuant to Rule 36 \r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure Defendant declined to make that \r\n  admission of fact. Now, over a period of more than a year since this case was \r\n  filed, documents and materials which have been exclusively in the possession, \r\n  custody and control of Defendant are surfacing which appear to make it highly \r\n  likely that the claimed mis-fill did occur and give some indication as to how \r\n  it occurred. Rather than come forward with all such information and evidence \r\n  in the ordinary course of discovery, Defendant took the path of concealment \r\n  and obstructed Plaintiffs' attempts to ascertain the truth.\r\n  \r\nOn the basis of the forgoing, I find \r\n  that some of Defendant Rite Aid of South Carolina's conduct in this matter was \r\n  intentional and in bad faith, that such conduct has accounted for expanding \r\n  the scope of this action into a complex and laboriously pursued discovery contest \r\n  with a commensurate unnecessary expenditure of court time and immeasurable diversion \r\n  of resources, in terms of time and expense by Plaintiffs' counsel.\r\n  \r\nIn total, the circuit court assessed \r\n  more than $40,000 in sanctions against Rite Aid in fines, attorneys' fees, and \r\n  costs for discovery abuses. Rite Aid has not appealed any of the discovery sanctions.\r\n  \r\nAlthough the defendants were not \r\n  complying with discovery requests, they consented to a scheduling order delineating \r\n  a discovery schedule which culminated in a date-certain trial set for October \r\n  7, 1996. The scheduling order was entered by Judge Hayes on August 6, 1996. \r\n  The scheduling order required the taking of all expert depositions by September \r\n  6, 1996. \r\n  \r\nIt is against this backdrop that \r\n  the defendants seek reversal, based upon surprise at the extent of damage claimed \r\n  by the Hundleys at trial. \r\n  \r\nA judge's ruling on whether to grant \r\n  a continuance will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Reiland \r\n  v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998). To justify a continuance, the moving party must show not only the absence \r\n  of some material evidence, but also due diligence on his part to obtain it. \r\n  Id., at 617, 500 S.E.2d at 145; Hudson v. Blanton, 282 S.C. 70, \r\n  316 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\n  \r\nThe parties were granted a day-certain \r\n  trial, which gave them priority status over other cases pending on the court's \r\n  docket. The administrative judge granted this request in deference to the complexity \r\n  of the case. Our state has long recognized that \"[t]he authority of the court \r\n  to grant continuances and to determine the order in which cases shall be heard \r\n  is derived from its power to hear and decide cases. This adjudicative power \r\n  of the court carries with it the inherent power to control the order of its \r\n  business to safeguard the rights of litigants.\" Williams v. Bordon's, Inc., \r\n  274 S.C. 275, 279, 262 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1980). \r\n  \r\nThe court bears a great responsibility \r\n  when signing a scheduling order which grants this special request, because it \r\n  directly impacts upon the rights of other litigants. When we review the denial \r\n  of a continuance in the exercise of the court's discretion under these circumstances, \r\n  we are mindful of the responsibility which the parties and their counsel assume \r\n  by seeking and receiving a day-certain status. It is incumbent upon them to \r\n  lay aside other business, and give priority in their preparation to that which \r\n  they have asked the court to prioritize. \r\n  \r\nIt would not be proper for a court \r\n  to deny a continuance as a sanction for unrelated discovery abuse. Griffin \r\n  Grading and Clearing, Inc. v. Tire Serv. Equip. Mfg. Co., Inc., 334 S.C. \r\n  193, 511 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. 1999) (sanction should be aimed at the specific \r\n  conduct of the party sanctioned and not go beyond the necessities of the situation \r\n  to foreclose a decision on the merits of a case). Nevertheless, in ruling upon \r\n  a motion for continuance, the court must determine the merits of the moving \r\n  party's argument, which entails an evaluation of credibility. Certainly a documented \r\n  history within the case of discovery delay and abuse by a party may be properly \r\n  considered when evaluating the credibility of that party's claim of surprise \r\n  and prejudice.\r\n  \r\nThe defendants first claim error \r\n  in the failure to grant a continuance based upon the change in diagnosed condition \r\n  of Gabrielle to mental retardation just before trial. As the Hundleys point \r\n  out, the record does not reflect that Jones and Rite Aid requested a continuance \r\n  after this change in Gabrielle's diagnosis. An argument is not preserved for \r\n  review where it has not been raised to or ruled upon by the trial court. Holtzscheiter \r\n  v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (1998) (issues \r\n  not raised to and ruled on by the trial court are not preserved for appellate \r\n  review). \r\n  \r\nJones and Rite Aid moved for a continuance \r\n  during pretrial conferences conducted in chambers outside the presence of a \r\n  court reporter. Normally, motions must be made on the record to be preserved. \r\n  York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 480 S.E.2d 726 (1997); see \r\n  also Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP. However, an oral motion that is later reduced \r\n  to writing can preserve an issue for appeal. Cockfield v. Jeffcoat, 280 \r\n  S.C. 606, 313 S.E.2d 365 (Ct. App. 1984). At the trial judge's suggestion, Jones \r\n  and Rite Aid's counsel attempted to reduce the oral, pretrial motions to writing \r\n  in an affidavit completed after trial. The affidavit states the trial judge \r\n  denied the motions for continuance, but fails to explain his reasoning. The \r\n  absence of the trial court's reasoning makes our task difficult. As appellants, \r\n  Jones and Rite Aid bear the burden of providing the court with a record sufficient \r\n  to allow appellate review. Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee, 322 S.C. \r\n  127, 470 S.E.2d 373 (1996). Nevertheless, we conclude the trial judge did not \r\n  abuse his discretion in refusing either the October 2, or the October 4 request \r\n  for a continuance. \r\n  \r\nThe defendants place great emphasis \r\n  on the change in diagnosis to \"mental retardation.\" We conclude the record does \r\n  not support a basis for attaching such significance to this change in label. \r\n  The defendants took the deposition of Dr. Tidler, a neuro-psychiatrist with \r\n  experience evaluating children, on September 13, 1996. Dr. Tidler evaluated \r\n  Gabrielle, noting she had a borderline level of intellectual functioning, with \r\n  a \"full scale I.Q.\" of 69. Her assessment was based, in part, on the test results \r\n  of a clinical psychologist, Dr. Venn, who had concluded Gabrielle's level of \r\n  functioning was \"slightly above mental retardation.\" \r\n   \r\nIn the deposition, Dr. Tidler recommended \r\n  Gabrielle receive \"ongoing assistance in almost every facet of her daily life.\" \r\n  She opined:\r\n  \r\nGabrielle's deficits are comprehensive \r\n  and interfere in many different aspects of daily living and learning and processing \r\n  information, and it's such a global comprehensive problem that she will require \r\n  an individual to assist her, for example, with a checking account, managing \r\n  her finances. She will require an individual to monitor her in many ways almost \r\n  as a child, in that her deficits are of the nature that she has difficulty learning, \r\n  processing information, that as that goes on in life that results in poor judgment \r\n  and poor decisions, and when individuals are impaired in that manner they either \r\n  have somebody who is by their side assisting them in those different facets, \r\n  in those different areas of life, or they make impulsive decisions, place themselves \r\n  in dangerous situations, end up having a very chaotic, disorganized, self-destructive \r\n  outcome.\r\n  \r\nGabrielle's future needs described \r\n  at trial were consistent with those described by Dr. Tidler in her deposition, \r\n  and Gabrielle's I.Q. of 69 had already been described as the borderline level \r\n  for mental retardation. Therefore, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial \r\n  court's refusal of the continuance on this basis.\r\n  \r\nThe defendants next argue a continuance \r\n  was mandated by the late revelation of the Life Care Plan. Jones and Rite Aid \r\n  received a copy of the Life Care Plan on October 1, six days before trial. Although \r\n  the defendants describe the $4,727,641 cost figure contained in the Life Care \r\n  Plan as a total surprise, the pretrial discovery and pleadings prove otherwise. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFirst, we note that from the time \r\n  of the very first Complaint the Hundleys claimed that Gabrielle had sustained \r\n  permanent physical and mental damage. More than six months before trial, Dr. \r\n  Venn opined that she had suffered brain damage lowering her I.Q. to 69, which \r\n  was borderline for mental retardation. Dr. Tidler's deposition testimony, quoted \r\n  above, was certainly sufficient to alert the defendants that Gabrielle would \r\n  require a significant level of care in the future.\r\n  \r\nWhile they may not have expected \r\n  its total, they had been informed on at least two prior occasions that the sum \r\n  which was anticipated for future care would be substantial. In a supplemental \r\n  answer to defense interrogatories, on August 26, 1996, the Hundleys stated that \r\n  Dr. Wood was still working on preparing a total cost \"to provide the care [Gabrielle] \r\n  will need in the future, but a very substantial figure is anticipated.\" The \r\n  Hundleys also proposed a settlement on August 29, 1996 based on Dr. Wood's opinion \r\n  that they should not settle for less than $5,000,000. \r\n  \r\nAlthough the defendants complain \r\n  about the last minute insertion of the $4,727,641 cost figure, they have presented \r\n  no argument to the trial court and there is no evidence in the record which \r\n  explains why this cost is so difficult to verify, and why they could not reasonably \r\n  have prepared to defend against it in the last six days before trial. In reality, \r\n  what the defendants argue as prejudicial is the medical basis for this cost; \r\n  that is, Gabrielle's need for managed care. But this prejudice, the trial court \r\n  found, was of their own making. Under the circumstances of this case, we see \r\n  no abuse of discretion in this ruling. \r\n  \r\nAs to the cost, the defendants present \r\n  no evidence the figure is incorrect, or that granting a continuance would have \r\n  allowed them to better defend against this estimate. As to the basis for asserting \r\n  this cost as an element of damage, the record amply demonstrates that any surprise \r\n  on the part of the defendants is of their own making, and not as a result of \r\n  the failure by the Hundleys to timely supplement their interrogatory answers. \r\n  See State v. Register, 323 S.C. 471, 476 S.E.2d 153 (1996) (where \r\n  parties knew in September that case was set for trial in January and full discovery \r\n  had been afforded from September forward, the fact that defendant's counsel \r\n  waited until the middle of December to investigate the evidence did not warrant \r\n  a continuance and no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's denial of the \r\n  motion for a continuance was found); McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., \r\n  325 S.C. 327, 479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996) (where plaintiff informed defendant \r\n  of significant change in medical condition, court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  by denying defendant's motion for continuance three weeks before trial, even \r\n  though case was very complex and difficult); Grant v. Grant, 288 S.C. \r\n  86, 340 S.E.2d 791 (Ct. App. 1986) (trial judge did not abuse his discretion \r\n  in denying request for a continuance where new counsel conceded case file was \r\n  fairly well prepared, he sought a continuance primarily to interview witnesses, \r\n  and there was nothing in the record to explain why witnesses were not interviewed \r\n  or could not have been interviewed during the six day period following the commencement \r\n  of his employment). \r\n  \r\nThe defendants next argue that they \r\n  were entitled to a 120 day continuance because the parent corporation was temporarily \r\n  joined as a party. On August 28, 1996, the Hundleys amended the complaints seeking \r\n  to join the parent Rite Aid Corporation as a defendant. The Hundleys sought \r\n  to establish that Rite Aid of South Carolina was part of the same corporation \r\n  as the parent corporation, citing pharmaceutical forms, employee understanding, \r\n  and overlapping corporate officers as their basis. The parent corporation appeared, \r\n  and on September 19, 1996, asked for a 120 day continuance to allow for discovery \r\n  as a newly added party in accordance with Rule 40, SCRCP. The Hundleys opposed \r\n  the continuance, asserting that if the court refused to consider the parent \r\n  corporation and Rite Aid of South Carolina as one and the same entity, then \r\n  the Hundleys would voluntarily dismiss the parent corporation to avoid a continuance \r\n  of the October 7 trial date. The court ruled that it would recognize the corporate \r\n  distinction between the two entities, whereupon the Hundleys were immediately \r\n  granted a voluntary dismissal of the parent corporation as a defendant. \r\n  \r\nRule 40(b), SCRCP, entitles parties \r\n  to 120 additional days of discovery when a new party is added. Here, the new \r\n  party was immediately dismissed as soon as they were deemed to be a new party. \r\n  There was no change in the status of the litigation, either as to parties or \r\n  as to issues. Consequently, this argument is without merit.\r\n  \r\nFinally, the defendants argue that \r\n  the trial court abused its discretion by not granting a continuance based upon \r\n  the death of Jones's mother prior to trial. The court took all reasonable measures \r\n  to accommodate Jones's loss, short of a continuance, including offering to instruct \r\n  the jury as to the reasons for his absence if he was required to leave in order \r\n  to attend the funeral.(5) Jones's testimony appears \r\n  normal and consistent with that contained in his deposition. The record does \r\n  not reflect any difficulty in his testimony. There was no proffer for the record \r\n  of any contemporaneous portrayal of Jones as unable to comprehend questions, \r\n  or as being so grief stricken as to be materially impaired in his ability to \r\n  testify. Consequently, there is no showing of prejudice, and we see no abuse \r\n  of discretion in refusing to grant a continuance on this basis. See Crouch \r\n  v. Cudd, 158 S.C. 1, 155 S.E. 136 (1930) (where counsel's mother fell ill, \r\n  lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying continuance, especially \r\n  since no prejudice was shown where all counsel were present and participated \r\n  in the trial).\r\nIII. ACTUAL \r\n  DAMAGES\r\n  \r\nJones and Rite Aid next challenge \r\n  the actual damages awarded against them based upon their earlier argument that \r\n  the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the cost of future medical \r\n  care contained in the Life Care Plan through Dr. Wood's testimony. As we find \r\n  no abuse of discretion in the admission of Dr. Wood's testimony, we find this \r\n  issue to be without merit. See Hutto, 325 S.C. 221, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  432 (1997) (expert's opinion is regarded as evidence in its own right and not \r\n  as hearsay in disguise). \r\n   \r\nIV. PUNITIVE \r\n  DAMAGES\r\n  \r\nNext, Jones and Rite Aid argue that \r\n  because there is no clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence in the \r\n  mis-filling of Gabrielle's prescription, the punitive damages against Rite Aid \r\n  should be reversed. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nThe power to assess punitive damages \r\n  is within the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by the trial judge. Miller \r\n  v. City of West Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 471 S.E.2d 683 (1996). \"In order \r\n  to receive an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence the defendant's misconduct was willful, wanton, \r\n  or in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights.\" Lister v. NationsBank, \r\n  of Delaware, N.A., 329 S.C. 133, 150, 494 S.E.2d 449, 458 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n  \r\nWe need not determine whether the \r\n  jury was presented with sufficient evidence of gross negligence in the mis-filling \r\n  of Gabrielle's prescription, because the jury may have awarded punitive damages \r\n  against Rite Aid solely on the negligent retention and supervision claims, a \r\n  possibility Rite Aid does not address in this issue. \"When a jury returns a \r\n  general verdict involving two or more issues and its verdict is supported as \r\n  to at least one issue, the appellate court will affirm unless the appellant \r\n  appeals all causes of action.\" Creach v. Sara Lee Corp., 331 S.C. 461, \r\n  464, 502 S.E.2d 923, 924 (Ct. App. 1998). By not arguing that the claims of \r\n  negligent retention and supervision could not support the punitive damages awards, \r\n  Rite Aid has waived that issue. See State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. \r\n  35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (issue not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned \r\n  and consideration on appeal is precluded).(6) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nV. INCONSISTENT \r\n  VERDICT\r\n  \r\nNext, Jones and Rite Aid argue that \r\n  the award of $11,000,000 against Rite Aid with no punitive damage award against \r\n  Jones constitutes an inconsistent verdict.(7) \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nA jury's verdict should be upheld \r\n  when possible to ascertain and give effect to the jury's intent. Vinson v. \r\n  Jackson, 327 S.C. 290, 491 S.E.2d 249 (1997). However, a verdict which is \r\n  internally inconsistent will be reversed and a new trial will be ordered. Id.; \r\n  Johnson v. Parker, 279 S.C. 132, 303 S.E.2d 95 (1983).\r\n  \r\nInitially, we note the preservation \r\n  of this issue is questionable. Rite Aid did not base any of its post trial motions \r\n  on an inconsistency in the jury verdict. An issue is not preserved for appellate \r\n  review unless it is raised to and ruled upon by the trial court. Holtzscheiter, \r\n  332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (1998).\r\n  \r\nRite Aid argues that because the \r\n  jury apparently did not find Jones guilty of willful, wanton, or reckless conduct, \r\n  that level of conduct may not be imputed against Rite Aid by respondeat superior \r\n  or by way of the supervision and retention claim. They cite two cases to support \r\n  this contention. In the slander action of Kirby v. Gulf Refining Co., \r\n  173 S.C. 224, 175 S.E. 535 (1934), our supreme court held a master cannot be \r\n  held solely responsible for damages where its liability is based on conduct \r\n  of its servant alone. However, it noted that where a master's liability is based \r\n  on its own conduct or the conduct of another, non-defendant servant, a verdict \r\n  against the master alone is not inconsistent. Id. In Collins v. Johnson, \r\n  245 S.C. 215, 139 S.E.2d 915 (1965), the court states that where the servant \r\n  has been exonerated of willfulness, the master cannot alone be held responsible \r\n  for punitive damages in an action where its liability is founded solely on respondeat \r\n  superior. \r\n  \r\nThese cases do not support Rite Aid's \r\n  position. Again we note that the jury may have awarded the punitive damages \r\n  on the negligent retention and supervision cause of action, which was only lodged \r\n  against Rite Aid.\r\n  \r\nThe Hundleys presented evidence that \r\n  at the time of the mis-fill, Jones was nearing the end of one of his twelve \r\n  hour work shifts. Jones was sixty-five years old, and his wife had died less \r\n  than one month before the mis-filled prescription. He worked these shifts five \r\n  days per week without another pharmacist present to relieve him. Rite Aid permitted \r\n  him to work these shifts despite his age and personal trauma, and despite the \r\n  fact that he had a history of mis-filling prescriptions, did not keep his paperwork \r\n  up to date, and had been cited for failing to keep the pharmacy up to DHEC regulations. \r\n  A memo in his personnel file recounted that his supervisor once took fourteen \r\n  hours to clean up the pharmacy and found violations such as multiple bottles \r\n  of the same drug open and pill bottles on the counters without their caps. \r\n  \r\nTaken in a light most favorabe to \r\n  the Hundleys, the evidence also reflects that Rite Aid has no policies or procedures \r\n  designed to ensure the competence of its pharmacists. Rite Aid considers its \r\n  pharmacists fit to work as long as they maintain their state licenses. Rite \r\n  Aid also has no policies, procedures, manuals, or directives dealing with the \r\n  storage or handling of medications or the filling and labeling of prescriptions, \r\n  leaving all such matters to the judgment of its pharmacists.  \r\n   \r\nConsidering the evidence of Rite \r\n  Aid's conduct in retaining and supervising Jones, we conclude the trial court \r\n  properly submitted the issue of punitive damages to the jury, and there is ample \r\n  evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Rite Aid alone was reckless. \r\n  Consequently, this verdict is not inconsistent.\r\n  \r\nVI. \r\n  JNOV OR NEW TRIAL ABSOLUTE\r\n  \r\nIn the final issue, Rite Aid argues \r\n  the punitive damages award was excessive as a matter of law, and consequently, \r\n  it is entitled to a new trial. We disagree.\r\n  \r\nOur appellate decisions have heretofore \r\n  recognized three stages for a trial court's review of punitive damages. \r\n \r\nFirst, the court must determine whether \r\n  the defendant's conduct rises to a sufficient level of culpability to submit \r\n  the issue to the jury. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love Chevrolet, \r\n  324 S.C. 149, 478 S.E.2d 57 (1996). We have already addressed this issue, and \r\n  find that the trial court was quite right in its decision.\r\n  \r\nSecond, the court must conduct a \r\n  post trial Gamble review to evaluate whether the award deprives the defendant \r\n  of due process. Id. If the court concludes that the defendant's due process \r\n  rights were violated, a new trial absolute or new trial nisi remittitur \r\n  is required. Id., at 149, 478 S.E.2d at 57. \r\n  \r\nGamble was decided in response \r\n  to the Supreme Court's decision in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, \r\n  499 U.S. 1 (1991), which addressed the due process challenge to punitive damage \r\n  awards primarily in the context of procedural due process. Thus, our court in \r\n  Gamble noted the guidance provided to the jury by the historically acceptable \r\n  jury instructions, the trial judge's post trial procedural ability to review \r\n  and decrease a jury verdict which the judge determines to be excessive, and \r\n  finally, the scope of appellate review.\r\n  \r\nHere, the trial judge conducted a \r\n  lengthy and meaningful Gamble review and concluded Rite Aid's due process \r\n  rights were not violated. Notwithstanding the charge to the jury as to Rite \r\n  Aid's ability to pay punitive damages, the court reviewed extensive information \r\n  by affidavit and by expert testimony as to Rite Aid's financial status, independently \r\n  concluding that Rite Aid had the ability to pay the award. The Court set forth \r\n  its findings as to each of the relevant factors articulated in Gamble. \r\n  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's conclusions following its \r\n  review of the jury verdict. Gamble; see also South Carolina \r\n  Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 324 S.C. at 149, 478 S.E.2d at 57 (trial court's \r\n  decision to modify a jury verdict as excessive or inadequate is reviewed under \r\n  an abuse of discretion standard).\r\n  \r\nFollowing its opinion in Haslip, \r\n  the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of punitive damages in a Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment Due Process challenge in TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Resources \r\n  Corp., 509 U.S. 443 (1993). The Court determined that a $10,000,000 punitive \r\n  damage award was sustainable, although the jury awarded only $19,000 in actual \r\n  damages. The Court rejected either a rational basis analysis or a heightened \r\n  scrutiny analysis, returning again to its \"general concern of reasonableness\" \r\n  to determine whether the award was \"so 'grossly excessive' as to violate the \r\n  substantive component of the Due Process Clause.\" Id., at 458. The court \r\n  rejected the ratio of punitive damages to actual damages of 526 to 1 as a dispositive \r\n  factor, recognizing instead that \"[i]t is appropriate to consider the magnitude \r\n  of the potential harm that the defendant's conduct would have caused to its \r\n  intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded, as well as the possible \r\n  harm to other victims that might have resulted if similar future behavior were \r\n  not deterred.\" Id. at 460. Finding that the potential of harm in the \r\n  case was conservatively $1,000,000, the punitive damage award did not \"jar [the \r\n  Court's] constitutional sensibilities.\" Id. at 462. \r\n  \r\nIn the subsequent case of BMW \r\n  of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), the Court once again \r\n  considered a due process challenge to a punitive damage award which was greatly \r\n  in excess of the actual damages found by the jury. Two underlying factors are \r\n  important to recognize in an analysis of this case. First, the factual basis \r\n  for the punitive damage award centered around a violation of Alabama's requirements \r\n  for automobile manufacturers and dealers in a consumer setting, and those requirements \r\n  were stricter than the consumer requirements of many other states. Second, the \r\n  plaintiff did not base his claim for punitive damages on the manufacturer's \r\n  activities in Alabama alone, but included instances of similar conduct occurring \r\n  in other states, where it was not illegal or improper. Recognizing that one \r\n  state may not punish for conduct occurring in another state which is acceptable \r\n  within that other state, the Court stated that constitutional jurisprudence \r\n  dictates that a person not only receive notice of the conduct that will subject \r\n  him to punishment, but also notice of the severity of the penalty that a state \r\n  may impose. The Court announced three \"guideposts\" for determining whether a \r\n  punitive damage award meets the constitutional requirement of providing fair \r\n  notice of the magnitude of the sanction. We turn now to an analysis of these \r\n  punitive damage awards, employing these \"guideposts.\" \r\n  \r\na). Degree \r\n  of Reprehensibility\r\n  \r\nThe Supreme Court recognized that \r\n  this first criterion, the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, \r\n  is, perhaps, the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive \r\n  damages award. We find several aggravating factors associated with Rite Aid's \r\n  conduct to be present in this case. First, in contrast to the damages in BMW \r\n  of North America, Inc., the damage to Gabrielle Hundley and to her parents \r\n  is not economic in nature. Permanent brain damage is among the most significant \r\n  of personal injuries, and permanently alters the enjoyment of life at its most \r\n  basic level. Rite Aid's indifference to the life, health and safety of others \r\n  is at the center of its misconduct. Furthermore, the conduct is repetitive in \r\n  nature, as demonstrated by Rite Aid's internal documentation and the reports \r\n  by the Board of Pharmacy. Finally, the record in this case discloses a deliberate \r\n  course of action by Rite Aid to avoid accountability by concealing the truth. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe court found that Rite Aid's conduct \r\n  throughout the litigation was abusive and obstructionist, concluding that Rite \r\n  Aid's misconduct was intentional and in bad faith. The fact of the missing records \r\n  and the inconsistent answers to interrogatories also formed a part of the Hundleys' \r\n  argument to the jury, asserting that Rite Aid had engaged in a cover-up. In \r\n  assessing the defendant's notice that its actions are so objectionable as to \r\n  give rise to substantial punitive damages, we think this conduct indirectly \r\n  adds credibility to the argument that Rite Aid's pre-incident approach to quality \r\n  assurance reflected a conscious indifference to the safety of others. It also \r\n  indicates that a substantial penalty may be necessary in order to deter future \r\n  similar conduct. \r\n  \r\nb). Ratio\r\n  \r\nPunitive damages must bear a \"reasonable \r\n  relationship\" to compensatory damages. With regard to Gabrielle's award, we \r\n  find no due process implications from the ratio of actual to punitive damages. \r\n  She was awarded $5,000,000 in actual damages. The punitive damage award is only \r\n  two times the actual damages awarded. We know of no case in the history of South \r\n  Carolina which finds such a ratio, in and of itself, to be constitutionally \r\n  excessive. \r\n  \r\nThe punitive damage award to the \r\n  Hundleys was $1,000,000 dollars, which is more than 200 times the actual damage \r\n  award of $20,000. But as the Supreme Court acknowledged, \"[i]ndeed, low awards \r\n  of compensatory damages may properly support a higher ratio than high compensatory \r\n  awards.\" Id. at 582. We conclude such circumstances are present here. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFirst, the non-economic injury to \r\n  the Hundleys is hard to determine or quantify. Second, as in TXO, the \r\n  amount of punitive damages awarded is reflective of the potential harm in this \r\n  case and in future cases involving similar conduct. The possibility that Rite \r\n  Aid's wilful conduct could have resulted in the death of the Hundleys' daughter \r\n  in this case was very real, as is the potential for such a devastating loss \r\n  to other victims if similar conduct were not deterred. Even a cursory inspection \r\n  of our case law demonstrates that an actual damage award far greater than that \r\n  here would be expected in a wrongful death suit under such circumstances. See, \r\n  e.g., Knoke v. South Carolina Dept. of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, \r\n  324 S.C. 136, 478 S.E.2d 256 (1996) ($3 million actual damage award in wrongful \r\n  death action for death of 12 year old child not grossly excessive); Lucht \r\n  v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, 221 S.E.2d 854 (1976) (actual damage award \r\n  of $103,000 for death of child was not excessive). Consequently, the ratio of \r\n  the actual damage award to the punitive damage award, when considered in light \r\n  of the potential harm, is not grossly excessive such as to offend due process. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n c). Sanctions \r\n  for Comparable Misconduct\r\n  \r\nComparing the punitive damages awarded \r\n  and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for similar misconduct \r\n  provided the third criterion for assessing excessiveness. The dispensing of \r\n  drugs is highly regulated in South Carolina. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  40-43-10 et. seq. (1986 &amp; Supp. 1998). Our legislature has enacted \r\n  provisions to meet the challenge of limiting the readily discernable health \r\n  dangers associated with this activity. In the event of non-compliance with those \r\n  provisions, the Board of Pharmacy is empowered to suspend or revoke the permit \r\n  of any drug dispensing facility. Section 40-43-260,(8) \r\n  in effect at the time of the incident, provided in pertinent part as follows:\r\n  \r\nE. Misconduct, which constitutes \r\n  grounds for revocation, suspension or other restriction of a license or a limitation \r\n  on or other discipline of a licensee shall be satisfactory showing to the board \r\n  of any of the following:\r\n(7) That the holder of a license \r\n  is guilty of engaging in any dishonorable, unethical or unprofessional conduct \r\n  that is likely to deceive, defraud or harm the public. \r\n  \r\n(10) That the holder of a license \r\n  has intentionally violated or attempted to violate, directly or indirectly, \r\n  or is assisting in or abetting the violating or conspiring to violate any provisions \r\n  or terms of this chapter.\r\n  \r\n(11) That the holder of a license \r\n  has been found by the board to lack the ethical or professional competence to \r\n  practice pharmacy.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-43-260 (Supp. \r\n  1997). Consequently, Rite Aid has notice that it can be totally prevented from \r\n  operating a pharmacy for precisely the kind of conduct alleged to have occurred \r\n  here. \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, the inquiry is not confined \r\n  to the specific provisions governing pharmacies. The misconduct established \r\n  at trial is that of recklessness in the management of a facility and personnel \r\n  dispensing drugs, which may proximately cause serious bodily injury to others. \r\n  The danger inherent in the handling of drugs is reflected in the comprehensiveness \r\n  of the regulatory scheme. See Â§ 40-43-10 et seq. (1986 &amp; Supp. 1999). \r\n  (9) It is analogous to the danger associated \r\n  with instrumentalities having a like capability to cause harm, such as the operation \r\n  of automobiles and the handling of weapons. This analogy reveals many instances \r\n  in South Carolina statutory and common law whereby reckless conduct causing \r\n  severe injury or death subjects the actor to substantial criminal penalties.(10) \r\n  Consequently, we conclude the sanctions historically and presently imposed under \r\n  South Carolina law provide consistent notice that a substantial penalty may \r\n  be imposed for reckless conduct in the handling of substances which are likely \r\n  to cause serious harm to others. \r\n  \r\nWe end our analysis where we began \r\n  it, with the recognition that \"[t]he amount of damages, actual and punitive, \r\n  remains largely within the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by the trial \r\n  court.\" Gamble, 305 S.C. at 112, 406 S.E.2d at 355. We conclude the punitive \r\n  damages awarded were not so grossly excessive as to violate due process. The \r\n  trial court adequately instructed the jury as required under Gamble, \r\n  and conducted an appropriate post-verdict review, arriving at well-reasoned \r\n  conclusions amply supported by the record. Likewise, the trial court's decision \r\n  to deny a discretionary reduction in the award is not controlled by any error \r\n  of law, and we find no abuse of discretion. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgments \r\n  are\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Necrosis is \r\n  the pathologic death of living tissue. See Taber's Cyclopedic Medical \r\n  Dictionary 1280 (17th illus. Ed. 1993). \r\n2.  Gamble \r\n  v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991). \r\n3.  Rule 43 (m)(2) \r\n  is identical to our current Rule 703. \r\n4.  In the trial \r\n  court's footnote, it stated its belief, which we share, that Rite Aid's trial \r\n  counsel acted in good faith and used his best efforts to comply with discovery. \r\n  \r\n5.  The funeral \r\n  was on the Sunday before trial, and Jones was present on Monday. He was not \r\n  called upon to testify until Thursday. \r\n6.  The possibility \r\n  that the punitive damages were awarded on the negligent retention and supervision \r\n  claim is nevertheless discussed below as it relates to Rite Aid's claim of an \r\n  inconsistency in the jury's verdict. \r\n7.  In their brief, \r\n  Jones and Rite Aid state that the award of no damages against Jones is inconsistent \r\n  with the $16,000,000 award against Rite Aid. (The argument, however, refers \r\n  only to punitive damages.) They further claim that it is unclear whether the \r\n  jury assessed actual damages against both Jones and Rite Aid or against Rite \r\n  Aid alone. Upon review, we believe it clear that the award of actual damages \r\n  is against both Jones and Rite Aid. No issue regarding the verdict form is raised \r\n  by the parties. \r\n8.  This section \r\n  was subsequently repealed and replaced in amended form by section 40-43-140, \r\n  which states in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\nThe board may suspend, revoke, deny, \r\n  or refuse to renew the permit of a permittee or impose disciplinary action authorized \r\n  by this chapter for:\r\n  \r\n(a) violations of any of the provisions \r\n  of this chapter or any regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter;\r\n  \r\n(b) retaining as an employee a person \r\n  who wilfully or habitually violates any of the state or federal laws applicable \r\n  to a permitted facility or its operation.\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-43-140 (Supp. \r\n  1999). \r\n9.  At the time \r\n  of this incident, Â§ 40-43-320, since repealed, provided a criminal penalty for \r\n  any person in violation of the provisions of chapter 43, including a fine not \r\n  to exceed five hundred dollars or imprisonment not exceeding eighteen months, \r\n  or both. The chapter was substantially revised in 1998, but retained an extensive \r\n  regulatory scheme. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-43-86 (Supp. 1999) (detailing \r\n  minimum requirements for permitted facilities). \r\n10.

Williams claimed an employee manual changed her status as an at-will employee. \r\n  She sued the Riedman Corporation for breach of contract, breach of the covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing, unfair trade practices, conspiracy, fraud, and \r\n  negligent misrepresentation. She also filed claims of conspiracy, fraud, and \r\n  negligent misrepresentation against James R. Riedman. Additionally, Williams \r\n  sued Rhoda Ryan, Riedman's branch manager, for conspiracy and tortious interference \r\n  with a contract. She sought a declaratory judgment concerning the restrictive \r\n  covenants in Riedman's Non-Piracy Agreement. Riedman answered, denying the employee \r\n  manual created a contract with Williams, and counterclaimed for breach of the \r\n  Non-Piracy Agreement, tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, \r\n  breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act, and violation of the Uniform \r\n  Trade Secrets Act. The jury found for Williams on the breach of contract and \r\n  breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing causes of action. It found \r\n  for the defendants on Williams's claims for negligent misrepresentation, fraud, \r\n  and conspiracy, but found for Williams on Riedman's counterclaim. Riedman appeals. \r\n  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nBeginning in 1982, Williams worked \r\n  for the Kay Insurance Agency. She held several different positions there, including \r\n  producer, sales representative, office manager, and vice president. While employed \r\n  with Kay, Williams acquired and serviced 148 accounts. In March 1994, Riedman \r\n  purchased Kay. Riedman operates insurance agencies in fourteen states, including \r\n  South Carolina, where it has four offices.\r\n  \r\nRiedman hired Williams to work in \r\n  its North Charleston office. As a condition of employment, Riedman required \r\n  Williams to sign a Non-Piracy Agreement, which contained a restrictive covenant \r\n  and a covenant not to disclose confidential information about clients. Williams \r\n  was given an employee manual at the outset of her employment. \r\n  \r\nRiedman alleged Williams was excessively \r\n  absent and tardy, and that she began missing work on a regular basis in January \r\n  1995. Rhoda Ryan kept handwritten notes of Williams's tardies and absences. \r\n  She sent these, along with the calendars that she kept, to Tracy Borrosh, Riedman's \r\n  assistant vice-president and personnel manager. \r\n  \r\nWilliams alleged the recording of \r\n  absences and late days was part of a concerted effort to have her terminated. \r\n  This tracking was without the knowledge of Williams's supervisor. Williams said \r\n  no one confronted her with alleged absenteeism or tardiness problems. \r\n  \r\nOn April 21, 1995, James Riedman \r\n  terminated Williams. At the time of her termination, Williams was earning $45,000.00 \r\n  per year. \r\n  \r\nWilliams suffered stress, depression, \r\n  and financial hardship as a result of her termination. In August 1995, she accepted \r\n  a lower paying position with Web-Kor, a local insurance agency.\r\n  \r\nIn September 1995, Riedman alleged \r\n  Williams was soliciting its clients. Riedman notified Williams that she was \r\n  violating her Non-Piracy Agreement. Williams did not respond to this letter. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nApproximately one month later, Williams \r\n  filed this lawsuit. After a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for \r\n  Williams on the breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing claims. The trial judge instructed the jury that if it entered \r\n  a verdict in favor of Williams, it must also find for Williams on Riedman's \r\n  counterclaim for breach of the Non-Piracy Agreement. \r\n  \r\nThe jury awarded Williams $88,448.00 \r\n  in actual damages for breach of contract, and $179,440.00 in actual damages \r\n  and $26,789.00 in punitive damages for breach of covenant of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing. The jury found in favor of the defendants on Williams's causes \r\n  of action for negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and conspiracy. The judge \r\n  granted Williams's directed verdict motion on the violation of the Uniform Trade \r\n  Secrets Act.(1) Riedman appeals.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  Employee Manual as a Contract\r\n  \r\nRiedman argues the trial \r\n  judge erred by not granting a directed verdict for the claims of breach of contract \r\n  and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  \r\n  Specifically, Riedman contends the employee manual did not constitute a binding \r\n  contract that altered Williams's at-will status.\r\n  \r\nWhen reviewing the denial \r\n  of a motion for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we \r\n  must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \r\n  Brady Dev. Co. v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 439 S.E.2d \r\n  266 (1993). A directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict should \r\n  not be granted unless only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence. \r\n  Id.\r\n  \r\nBecause this was an action \r\n  for breach of a contract, it is an action at law. Leahy v. Starflo Corp., \r\n  314 S.C. 546, 431 S.E.2d 567 (1993). Our review of an action at law tried by \r\n  a jury extends merely to correcting errors of law. We will not disturb the facts \r\n  determined by the jury unless there is no evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the jury's findings. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 \r\n  S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976); Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  444 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n  \r\nAn individual working for \r\n  an employer under a contract of employment for an indefinite period can be terminated \r\n  at will. Shealy v. Fowler, 182 S.C. 81, 188 S.E. 499 (1936). Termination \r\n  of an at-will employee does not normally give rise to a cause of action for \r\n  breach of contract. Hudson v. Zenith Engraving Co., 273 S.C. 766, 259 \r\n  S.E.2d 812 (1979). However, when the at-will status of the employee is altered \r\n  by the terms of an employee handbook, thereby creating a contractual employment \r\n  relationship, a cause of action for wrongful discharge may arise. Small v. \r\n  Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987) (Small I).\r\n  \r\nThe existence of a contract \r\n  for employment should be submitted to the jury when (1) its existence is questioned, \r\n  and (2) the evidence is conflicting or admits of more than one inference. Small \r\n  I, 292 S.C. at 483, 357 S.E.2d at 454; Jones v. General Elec. Co., \r\n  331 S.C. 351, 503 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. denied, (May 14, \r\n  1999). The relevant issues for determining if the handbook forms a contract \r\n  are whether (1) the handbook sets out procedures binding on the employer, (2) \r\n  those procedures applied to the employee, and (3) the employer violated those \r\n  procedures. Miller v. Schmid Labs., Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 414 S.E.2d 126 \r\n  (1992); Jones, 331 S.C. at 358, 503 S.E.2d at 177. \r\n  \r\nA. \r\n  \r\n Riedman \r\nasserts Williams failed to establish the employee manual constituted a contract \r\nthat altered her at-will status either because of mandatory language in the manual \r\nor because of oral statements made by her supervisors.\r\n \r\nWilliams argues the employee manual \r\n  contained language which was binding on Riedman, specifically that she be treated \r\n  fairly and that a progressive disciplinary process be followed. She asserts \r\n  that combining the language of the employee manual, the disciplinary procedures \r\n  detailed on the back of the absentee calendar, and the employee disciplinary \r\n  report form created a progressive disciplinary process that Riedman was bound \r\n  to follow prior to termination. She contends she was wrongfully terminated for \r\n  excessive absences when she was not given any warning prior to her termination. \r\n  Williams argues the jury should determine whether a contract existed and, if \r\n  so, whether Riedman breached that contract.  \r\n   \r\nThe employee manual contained \r\n  the following relevant language:\r\n  \r\nObservance of work rules is essential \r\n  to the orderly conduct of business, and benefits both you and the company. Failure \r\n  to observe these rules, or any other policies listed in this manual, can result \r\n  in disciplinary action. Disciplinary action is normally progressive, starting \r\n  with a verbal warning, and ending with dismissal if appropriate corrective action \r\n  is not taken.  \r\nImmediate dismissal can follow the \r\n  use of rude, discourteous or profane language to clients or other employees; \r\n  theft or dishonesty; damaging or willfully misusing company property; falsifying \r\n  or willfully omitting company records or reports; failure to adhere to established \r\n  accounting or bookkeeping procedures; or possessing or reporting to work under \r\n  the influence of alcohol or any illegal drug.  \r\n   \r\nThe manual also contains a subsection \r\n  entitled \"Tardiness and Absenteeism.\" That section states: \r\n   \r\nPrevention of tardiness and absenteeism \r\n  is vital to the efficient operation of the business. Repeated lateness and absence \r\n  can be cause for dismissal. Please report to your supervisor as early as possible \r\n  if you anticipate being late or absent for any reason. \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, the manual contained \r\n  a pledge by Riedman to, among other things, \"Assure equal treatment of all who \r\n  work for the company by applying policies and procedures fairly throughout all \r\n  company offices.\"   \r\nViewing the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to Williams, a jury issue exists concerning whether the employee \r\n  manual, related documents, and any oral representations created a binding employment \r\n  contract which altered Williams's at-will status. The employee manual contained \r\n  several sections relating to disciplinary procedure. The manual stated disciplinary \r\n  action was normally progressive. The offenses which warranted immediate dismissal \r\n  did not include excessive absenteeism or tardiness. \r\n   \r\nRiedman's employee disciplinary reports \r\n  and absentee calendars also give rise to an inference that discipline was normally \r\n  progressive. The employee disciplinary report form contains a section entitled \r\n  \"Action to be Taken,\" which lists a four-step process including a warning, probation, \r\n  suspension, and dismissal. The absentee calendar includes a section entitled \r\n  \"Record of Communications Involving Excessive Absence.\" This section allows \r\n  for reporting dates that verbal warnings and written notices were provided to \r\n  the employee for excessive absences. \r\n   \r\nWilliams indicated she believed discipline \r\n  was normally progressive. Based on the employee manual and her discussions with \r\n  Riedman, Williams stated she should have been given a warning prior to her termination. \r\n  Williams testified that when she raised concerns to James Riedman about whether \r\n  she could be terminated for any reason, he told her the \"Riedman Corporation \r\n  was a very fair company. That I would not have to have any concerns that I would \r\n  ever be treated unfairly.\" Moreover, she also discussed the company's disciplinary \r\n  procedure with Tracy Borrosh, Riedman's assistant vice-president and personnel \r\n  manager. Based on this meeting and her review of the employee manual, Williams \r\n  believed discipline was to be progressive, starting with a verbal warning and \r\n  followed by written warnings.  \r\n   \r\nRichard Kay, Williams's supervisor, \r\n  also testified he understood discipline was to be progressive. Kay was aware \r\n  of the employee disciplinary form, which outlined a four-step disciplinary process. \r\n  Additionally, he believed the procedure involved a warning, followed by a written \r\n  letter to the employee's personnel file, and finally termination. \r\n   \r\nBoth James Riedman and Borrosh stated \r\n  discipline was normally progressive. However, they stated whether the four-step \r\n  procedure was followed depended on the particular infraction. Ryan also acknowledged \r\n  she thought the four-step disciplinary procedure was supposed to be used in \r\n  cases of excessive absences. \r\n   \r\nBecause the evidence is conflicting \r\n  as to whether the terms of Riedman's employee manual were mandatory or permissive \r\n  and whether Williams received oral assurances sufficient to create an employment \r\n  contract, we find the trial judge properly denied Riedman's motions for a directed \r\n  verdict on Williams's claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing. See Small I, 292 S.C. at 483-84, \r\n  357 S.E.2d at 454 (The question is for the fact finder if a handbook and other \r\n  evidence creates conflicting inferences as to whether the employer altered the \r\n  employee's at-will status.); Kumpf v. United Tel. Co. of the Carolinas, \r\n  311 S.C. 533, 429 S.E.2d 869 (Ct. App. 1993) (If the existence of a contract \r\n  is disputed and the evidence creates more than one reasonable inference, the \r\n  question is one for the jury). \r\n   \r\nB.  \r\n   \r\nRiedman argues that, even if the \r\n  employee manual contained mandatory language, or could create a contract, the \r\n  manual contained a valid disclaimer. Additionally, Riedman claims Williams had \r\n  actual notice and knowledge of the disclaimer based on the other documents she \r\n  received in conjunction with the employee manual. \r\n   \r\n The disclaimer in Riedman's employee \r\n  manual was located in the first paragraph on the first page in the \"Introduction \r\n  and History\" section. It states: \r\n   \r\nWelcome to Riedman Corporation. This \r\n  manual is intended to inform you of the company's history and goals and to outline \r\n  how the company operates. While the manual is not a contract of employment, \r\n  it does provide every employee with the details of day-to-day company routine, \r\n  together with an outline of work rules and employees' benefits and rights. Thus \r\n  it is important for every employee to read it carefully and to keep it for reference \r\n  should any question or problem arise. The card that accompanies the manual should \r\n  be signed and returned. It acknowledges your receipt of the manual and the information \r\n  it contains.   \r\nIf an employer wishes to issue an \r\n  employee manual without being bound by it, the employer must insert a conspicuous \r\n  disclaimer or provision into the written document. Small I, 292 S.C. \r\n  at 485, 357 S.E.2d at 455. However, \r\n   \r\n[T]he disclaimer is merely one factor \r\n  to consider in ascertaining whether the handbook as a whole conveys credible \r\n  promises that should be enforced. . . . [A] handbook that contains both promissory \r\n  language and a disclaimer should be viewed as inherently ambiguous. . . . As \r\n  with any question of fact, this is primarily a matter for the jury to decide. \r\n  The court should intervene to resolve the handbook issue as a matter of law \r\n  only if the handbook statements and the disclaimer, taken together, establish \r\n  beyond any doubt tha[t] an enforceable promise either does or does not exist. \r\n   \r\nFleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 \r\n  S.C. 452, 463-64, 450 S.E.2d 589, 596 (1994) (quoting Stephen F. Befort, Employee \r\n  Handbooks and the Legal Effect of Disclaimers, 13 Indus. Rel. L.J. 326, \r\n  375-76 (1991-92)).   \r\nIn Hannah v. United Refrigerated \r\n  Services., Inc., 312 S.C. 42, 430 S.E.2d 539 (Ct. App. 1993), we determined \r\n  that a disclaimer in the manual's \"Welcome\" section, which was not otherwise \r\n  set off, was not conspicuous. We stated, \"[t]he test for conspicuousness is \r\n  whether there is something about the provision that reasonably calls attention \r\n  to it.\" Id. at 46, 430 S.E.2d at 541-42. If the disclaimer is not capitalized, \r\n  in bold lettering, set apart with a distinctive border, or in some other way \r\n  set off from the general text, the disclaimer is ineffectual. Id.; cf. \r\n  Marr v. City of Columbia, 307 S.C. 545, 416 S.E.2d 615 (1992) (disclaimer \r\n  found to be conspicuous where it was placed in large letters on the front cover \r\n  of employee handbook, and then repeated in large bold type on a separate page \r\n  of the handbook); Kumpf v. United Tel. Co. of the Carolinas, 311 S.C. \r\n  533, 429 S.E.2d 869 (Ct. App. 1993) (disclaimer located on the last page in \r\n  the \"conclusion\" section of the employee handbook was not conspicuous where \r\n  it was not capitalized, bolded, set apart with distinctive border, or in contrasting \r\n  type or color).  \r\nTurning to the facts of this case, \r\n  we cannot say as a matter of law that the provision relied on by Riedman was \r\n  sufficiently conspicuous to be a valid disclaimer. Although it is located in \r\n  the first paragraph of the employee manual, it is not capitalized, in bold type, \r\n  or in any other way set-off. Accordingly, the determination of whether the disclaimer \r\n  was conspicuous was a factor for the jury to consider in determining whether \r\n  there was an employment contract. See Fleming, 316 S.C. at 464 \r\n  n.6, 450 S.E.2d at 596 n.6 (question of whether a disclaimer is conspicuous \r\n  is a fact question).   \r\nFurthermore, we reject Riedman's \r\n  contention that Williams's actual notice and knowledge of the disclaimer precluded \r\n  her reliance on the documents as an employment contract. Riedman asserts Williams \r\n  knew she did not have a contract of employment because she signed the following \r\n  documents: the offer of employment which indicated her employment was not for \r\n  a definite term; an applicant's statement which stated she was employed at-will; \r\n  and an acceptance card which indicated she had received and reviewed the employee \r\n  manual. \r\nAlthough Williams acknowledged she \r\n  signed the documents when hired by Riedman, she testified no one ever discussed \r\n  with her that she was an at-will employee. Moreover, specific reference to an \r\n  at-will relationship was limited to a section of the employment application \r\n  which Williams signed. This reference, which was not underlined or in distinctive \r\n  type, included a two-sentence definition of an at-will relationship. Williams \r\n  believed the employee manual was a contract because she was required to sign \r\n  it before she was hired. Furthermore, the acceptance card only acknowledged \r\n  that Williams had \"received and reviewed\" the employee manual, not that she \r\n  had read and understood the disclaimer.  \r\n   \r\nTherefore, the trial judge did not \r\n  err in submitting this issue to the jury. See Hannah, 312 S.C. \r\n  at 46-47, 430 S.E.2d at 542 (trial judge erred in granting summary judgment \r\n  as to whether employee had actual notice of inconspicuous disclaimer where employee \r\n  testified he only read parts of the employee handbook and where affidavit signed \r\n  by employee upon receipt of the handbook did not indicate employee had read \r\n  entire handbook and the disclaimer, nor did it include a separate provision \r\n  ensuring that employee understood the handbook). \r\n   \r\nII. Evidence \r\n  of Breach  \r\nRiedman next argues there was no \r\n  evidence of breach because the employee manual states that discipline is \"normally \r\n  progressive\" and does not establish a set procedure. Moreover, the employee \r\n  manual contains a provision, stating \"Repeated lateness and absence can be cause \r\n  for dismissal.\" As such, Riedman contends it had the right to immediately discharge \r\n  Williams.  \r\nThe evidence is conflicting concerning \r\n  whether Riedman breached the employment contract by immediately terminating \r\n  Williams.  \r\nAlthough Williams believed discipline \r\n  was normally progressive, she was never notified of a problem with excessive \r\n  absences prior to her termination. Kay also was never made aware of Williams's \r\n  attendance problem until immediately before Riedman terminated her. \r\n   \r\nIn contrast, both Riedman and Borrosh \r\n  stated whether the four-step disciplinary procedure was followed depended on \r\n  the particular infraction. Riedman testified he was justified in terminating \r\n  Williams without a warning based on her attendance record, her decreasing production \r\n  numbers, and two complaints that customers had made about Williams's service \r\n  of their accounts.  \r\nThe evidence concerning Williams's \r\n  absenteeism and work performance is also in dispute. Williams questioned the \r\n  accuracy of the days she was alleged to have been absent or tardy. Kay stated \r\n  Williams had not been absent an inordinate amount of time and he never had problems \r\n  with her performance.   \r\nCarol Gomez, a receptionist who worked \r\n  for Riedman between April 1994 and May 1995, testified Williams called in on \r\n  all days that she would be working out of the office. According to Gomez, Williams \r\n  always stated where she could be reached when she was not in the office. Gomez \r\n  also stated there were never any complaints about Williams. \r\n   \r\nAlthough the testimony of Borrosh, \r\n  Ryan, and other Riedman employees supported Riedman's allegation that Williams \r\n  was excessively absent, the documentation of these absences is conflicting. \r\n  Borrosh testified that at the beginning of April 1995, Ryan informed her that \r\n  Williams had been out of the office a lot in the preceding months. Ryan kept \r\n  track of employees' sick days and vacation days on two personal calendars in \r\n  the office. She then transferred the information to employee calendar cards \r\n  and absentee calendars.   \r\nOn April 6, 1995, Ryan sent Borrosh \r\n  Williams's 1995 absentee calendar. Subsequently, Borrosh reviewed the absentee \r\n  calendar in conjunction with Ryan's handwritten notes. Based on this information, \r\n  Borrosh added tardy days to the calendar. She then took this information directly \r\n  to James Riedman, who instructed Borrosh to charge Williams with \"vacation days\" \r\n  for the days that she had been absent. In a memo dated April 20, 1995, Williams \r\n  was informed she had been charged with five sick days and thirteen vacation \r\n  days. The memo also indicated she had two remaining vacation days. Riedman made \r\n  the decision to terminate Williams on April 21, 1995. \r\n   \r\nWhen Williams reviewed the memo and \r\n  absentee calendar, she noted there were errors. She asserted she was charged \r\n  with vacation days for days that she had been working. Because she was terminated \r\n  the next day, Williams never had an opportunity to look at Ryan's documentation.\r\nRyan testified there were discrepancies \r\n  between the two 1995 absentee calendars prepared for Williams. She indicated \r\n  there were notations that were not in her handwriting, tardy days were noted, \r\n  and some of the \"sick day\" codes had been changed. According to Ryan, these \r\n  changes were made by the corporate office.  \r\n   \r\n The evidence of breach is conflicting. \r\n  Therefore, the jury should make this determination. See Small I, \r\n  292 S.C. at 483-84, 357 S.E.2d at 454 (question of whether employee handbook, \r\n  bulletin, and the oral assurances constituted an employment contract was for \r\n  the jury's determination; if the jury found the existence of an employment contract, \r\n  then it had to decide whether or not employer reasonably could have determined \r\n  that employee's actions constituted a serious offense which could result in \r\n  discharge without the four-step disciplinary process). \r\n   \r\nIII. Breach \r\n  of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \r\n   \r\nRiedman additionally argues the cause \r\n  of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should \r\n  be in contract rather than tort. Therefore, as a contract claim, it cannot support \r\n  an award of punitive damages. \r\n   \r\n\"Although implied covenants are not \r\n  favored in the law, . . . there exists in every contract an implied covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing.\" Commercial Credit Corp. v. Nelson Motors, \r\n  Inc., 247 S.C. 360, 366-67, 147 S.E.2d 481, 484 (1966). Breach of this covenant \r\n  has been recognized as a cause of action in the employment context in South \r\n  Carolina. Specifically, we have stated, \"[W]e find no authoritative case law \r\n  holding the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not applicable \r\n  to employment contracts that alter the employee's at-will status.\" Shelton \r\n  v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., 319 S.C. 81, 91, 459 S.E.2d 851, 857 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995), aff'd, 325 S.C. 248, 481 S.E.2d 706 (1997). \r\nTo date, a tort cause of action for \r\n  breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing appears only in the \r\n  insurance arena under a claim for bad faith refusal to pay benefits. The Supreme \r\n  Court stated:  \r\nIn Nichols v. State Farm Mut. \r\n  Auto. Ins. Co., 279 S.C. 336, 306 S.E.2d 616 (1983), we recognized the existence \r\n  of a cause of action against an insurance company for bad faith refusal to pay \r\n  first party benefits due under an insurance contract. In so doing we cited with \r\n  approval the reasoning used in the seminal case of Gruenberg v. Aetna Ins. \r\n  Co., 9 Cal.3d 566, 108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032 (1973), that there is \r\n  an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every insurance contract \r\n  \"that neither party will do anything to impair the other's rights to receive \r\n  benefits under the contract.\" Nichols, 279 S.C. at 339, 306 S.E.2d at \r\n  618.   \r\nTadlock Painting Co. v. Maryland \r\n  Cas. Co., 322 S.C. 498, 500, 473 S.E.2d 52, 53 (1996). \r\n   \r\nWilliams's cause of action for breach \r\n  of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should only allow recovery \r\n  of contract damages. Because an insurance relationship is decidedly different \r\n  from an employment relationship, we decline to permit tort recovery for this \r\n  cause of action.  \r\nA.  \r\n   \r\n The South Carolina cases which recognize \r\n  bad faith as a tort cause of action place special emphasis on the relationship \r\n  between an insurer and the insured. See Tadlock, 322 S.C. at 503, \r\n  473 S.E.2d at 55; Nichols v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 279 S.C. \r\n  336, 306 S.E.2d 616 (1983). The same special relationship does not exist in \r\n  employment situations.  \r\nIn Tadlock, the Supreme Court \r\n  elaborates:  \r\n\"[I]f the cause of action is predicated \r\n  on the alleged breach, or even negligent breach, of a contract between the parties, \r\n  an action in tort will not lie. On the other hand, where the contract creates \r\n  a certain relationship between the parties, and certain duties arise by operation \r\n  of law, irrespective of the contract, because of this relationship, then the \r\n  breach of such duties warrants an action in tort.\" The duty of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing is such a duty that arises by operation of law due to the special \r\n  relationship of the parties in an insurance contract, as Brown itself \r\n  noted.  \r\nTadlock, 322 S.C. at 503 n.5, \r\n  473 S.E.2d at 55 n.5 (quoting Brown v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 284 S.C. \r\n  47, 52-54, 324 S.E.2d 641, 644-46 (Ct. App. 1994), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., \r\n  313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993)) (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina first recognized a \r\n  tort cause of action for an insurer's unreasonable refusal to accept a settlement \r\n  within the policy limits. Tyger River Pine Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., \r\n  170 S.C. 286, 170 S.E. 346 (1933). This doctrine has been extended to include \r\n  the bad faith refusal to pay a first party claim by an insured. In Nichols, \r\n  our Supreme Court stated, \"The cause of action we consider today and that which \r\n  is commonly known as the 'Tyger River Doctrine,' are merely two different aspects \r\n  of the same duty.\" Nichols, 279 S.C. at 339-40, 306 S.E.2d at 619. The \r\n  Court explained its reasoning for holding the bad faith refusal to pay should \r\n  be in tort and not contract: \r\n   \r\nThe public policy reasons for recognizing \r\n  this cause of action are plentiful. The insurance business is affected with \r\n  a public interest. Hinds v. United Ins. Co. of America, 248 S.C. 285, \r\n  149 S.E.2d 771 (1966). An insured ordinarily possesses no bargaining power and \r\n  no means of protecting himself from the kind of treatment of which Respondent \r\n  complained. \"An insured does not contract to obtain any kind of commercial advantage \r\n  or leverage but only to protect himself against the spectre of accidental [or \r\n  unavoidable] loss.\" Trimper v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 540 F.Supp. 1188, \r\n  1193 (D.C.S.C.1982).  \r\nAbsent the threat of a tort action, \r\n  the insurance company can, with complete impunity, deny any claim they wish, \r\n  whether valid or not. During the ensuing period of litigation following such \r\n  a denial, the insurance company has the benefit of profiting on the use of the \r\n  insured's money. Heretofore, the only compensation a successful insured could \r\n  expect through litigation was the belated payment of his claim and the possibility \r\n  of recovering attorney fees up to two thousand five hundred ($2,500.00) dollars. \r\n    \r\nNichols, 279 S.C. at 340, \r\n  306 S.E.2d at 619. This same reasoning prevailed in Tadlock. Our Supreme \r\n  Court, citing an Arizona case, stated: \r\n  \r\nThe court reasoned that an insured \r\n  is not only bargaining for security from financial loss, the primary goal motivating \r\n  the purchase of insurance, when it enters into an insurance contract. Rather, \r\n  \"the insured also is entitled to receive the additional security of knowing \r\n  that she will be dealt with fairly and in good faith. That security comes not \r\n  from the express contractual terms, but from the implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing.\" (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nTadlock, 322 S.C. at 502, \r\n  473 S.E.2d at 54 (quoting Deese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 838 \r\n  P.2d 1265, 1269 (Ariz. 1992)(en banc)). \r\n   \r\nB.  \r\n   \r\nThe reasoning for permitting tort \r\n  recovery in the insurance context is well established. However, neither this \r\n  Court nor our Supreme Court has addressed whether an employee can recover in \r\n  tort from an employer for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair \r\n  dealing. Accordingly, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance. \r\n   \r\nAlthough there is a split of authority, \r\n  the majority of jurisdictions have concluded that an employee may not recover \r\n  in tort for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In \r\n  a number of these cases, the courts explicitly declined to apply the special \r\n  relationship that exists between an insured and insurer to the employment context. \r\n  See Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v.

Co., 920 P.2d 334, 346 (Haw. 1996) (\"[T]he availability \r\n  of a tort recovery for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \r\n  dealing may be justified in actions brought on insurance contracts, but not \r\n  necessarily in actions brought on other types of contract.\"); Miller Brewing \r\n  Co. v.

In such instances the implied obligation is \r\n  in aid and furtherance of other terms of the agreement of the parties.\") (citation \r\n  omitted).  \r\nA minority of states recognize a \r\n  tort claim for breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing by applying \r\n  the insurance analogy. The type of employment situations which give rise to \r\n  this recovery are, however, extremely limited. See K Mart Corp. v. \r\n  Ponsock, 732 P.2d 1364, 1370 (Nev. 1987) (where nationwide employer terminated \r\n  employee in bad faith for the improper motive of defeating contractual retirement \r\n  benefits, employee entitled to punitive damages; Court reasoned,\"[A]lthough \r\n  a duty of good faith and fair dealing is created by law in all cases, it is \r\n  only in rare and exceptional cases that the duty is of such a nature as to give \r\n  rise to tort liability. The kind of breach of duty that brings into play the \r\n  bad faith tort arises only when there are special relationships between the \r\n  tort-victim and the tortfeasor . . ..\"), abrogated by Ingersoll-Rand \r\n  Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133 (1990) (ERISA pre-empts state wrongful discharge \r\n  actions based on employer interference with rights under employee benefit plan); \r\n  Wilder v. Cody Country Chamber of Commerce, 868 P.2d 211, 222 (Wyo. 1994) \r\n  (\"When a special relationship of trust and reliance is demonstrated, a breach \r\n  of the implied covenant is actionable as a tort. Therefore, compensatory damages \r\n  are available to hold employers accountable for a breach of the implied covenant.\") \r\n  (citation omitted).(2)  \r\n   \r\nWe are persuaded by the reasoning \r\n  in the seminal case of Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 765 P.2d 373 \r\n  (Cal. 1988) (en banc). In Foley, the California Supreme Court found that \r\n  a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \r\n  dealing existed in employment contract actions, but it was limited to contractual \r\n  damages and was not in tort. The Court stated: \r\n   \r\nAn allegation of breach of the implied \r\n  covenant of good faith and fair dealing is an allegation of breach of an \"ex \r\n  contractu\" obligation, namely one arising out of the contract itself. The covenant \r\n  of good faith is read into contracts in order to protect the express covenants \r\n  or promises of the contract, not to protect some general public policy interest \r\n  not directly tied to the contract's purposes. The insurance cases thus were \r\n  a major departure from traditional principles of contract law. We must, therefore, \r\n  consider with great care claims that extension of the exceptional approach taken \r\n  in those cases is automatically appropriate if certain hallmarks and similarities \r\n  can be adduced in another contract setting.  \r\n   \r\nFoley, 765 P.2d at 394. The \r\n  Court specifically rejected the contention that the employment relationship \r\n  was analogous to that of insurance thereby warranting a right to tort recovery \r\n  for breach of an implied covenant. Id. at 395.  \r\n   \r\nThe Court reasoned that \"a breach \r\n  in the employment context does not place the employee in the same economic dilemma \r\n  that an insured faces when an insurer in bad faith refuses to pay a claim or \r\n  to accept a settlement offer within policy limits.\" Id. at 396. It noted \r\n  that when an insurer acts in bad faith, the insured cannot turn to the marketplace \r\n  and find another insurance company willing to pay for the loss. Id. In \r\n  contrast, an employee who is terminated is able to seek alternative employment. \r\n  Id. The Court also emphasized the fundamental difference between insurance \r\n  and employment relationships. Id. In the insurance relationship, the \r\n  insurer and the insured are financially at odds. Id. In comparison, \"[t]he \r\n  interests of employer and employee are most frequently in alignment\" because \r\n  \"it is to the employer's economic benefit to retain good employees.\" Id. \r\n    \r\nIn view of these marked differences, \r\n  the Court concluded:  \r\n[T]he employment relationship is \r\n  not sufficiently similar to that of insurer and insured to warrant judicial \r\n  extension of the proposed additional tort remedies in view of the countervailing \r\n  concerns about economic policy and stability, the traditional separation of \r\n  tort and contract law, and finally, the numerous protections against improper \r\n  terminations already afforded employees. \r\n   \r\nId. at 396. \r\n   \r\n\"Initially, the concept of a duty \r\n  of good faith developed in contract law as 'a kind of \"safety valve\" to which \r\n  judges may turn to fill gaps and qualify or limit rights and duties otherwise \r\n  arising under the rules of law and specific contract language.'\" Foley, \r\n  765 P.2d at 389 (citing Summers, The General Duty of Good Faith-Its Recognition \r\n  and Conceptualization, 67 Cornell L. Rev. 810, 812 (1982)). Since its application \r\n  in this state, South Carolina appellate courts have consistently given credence \r\n  to the underlying purpose of the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing by \r\n  using it to protect the intentions of the parties to the contract. See \r\n  Commercial Credit Corp. v. Nelson Motors, Inc., 247 S.C. 360, 367, 147 \r\n  S.E.2d 481, 484 (1966) (\"'[T]erms which may clearly be implied from a consideration \r\n  of the entire contract are as much a part thereof as though plainly written \r\n  on its face.'\"(quoting 17A C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 328 at 282-84)); Id. \r\n  (\"'In the absence of an express provision therefor, the law will imply an agreement \r\n  by the parties to a contract to do and perform those things that according to \r\n  reason and justice they should do in order to carry out the purpose for which \r\n  the contract was made.'\").  \r\n   \r\nOther than the limited insurance \r\n  context, courts of this state have effectuated this underlying purpose by applying \r\n  contract law to a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing. See Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 174 \r\n  S.E.2d 397 (1970) (There exists in every contract an implied covenant of good \r\n  faith and fair dealing.); Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, \r\n  334 S.C. 469, 514 S.E.2d 126 (1999) (A breach of covenant of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing cannot stand if the party seeking damages has not performed under \r\n  the contract.); Id. at 487, 514 S.E.2d at 135 (\"[O]ne who seeks to recover \r\n  damages for breach of a contract, to which he was a party, must show that the \r\n  contract has been performed on his part, or at least that he was, at the appropriate \r\n  time, able, ready, and willing to perform it.\" (quoting Parks v. Lyons, \r\n  219 S.C. 40, 48, 64 S.E.2d 123, 126 (1951)); Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, \r\n  Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995) (\"[T]here is no breach \r\n  of an implied covenant of good faith where a party to a contract has done what \r\n  provisions of the contract expressly gave him the right to do.\"). Notably, we \r\n  have declined to apply this covenant to the employment at-will situation where \r\n  no contract exists. Keiger v. Citgo, Coastal Petroleum, Inc., 326 S.C. \r\n  369, 482 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App. 1997) (affirming trial judge's dismissal of cause \r\n  of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where \r\n  employee failed to allege in her complaint that her at-will employment status \r\n  had been altered).   \r\nAs evidenced by these cases, the \r\n  implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has been viewed as another contract \r\n  term. Under a breach of contract claim, a party's damages are limited to those \r\n  under the contract, and no tort remedies are available, including punitive damages. \r\n  Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 300 S.C. 481, 484, 388 S.E.2d 808, 810 \r\n  (1990) (Small II) (where employment contract is for an indefinite term, \r\n  \"[a] wrongfully discharged employee suing for breach of contract is entitled \r\n  to receive the amount of the employee['s] net losses caused by the employer's \r\n  breach. Such losses may include back pay as well as future damages.\") (citations \r\n  omitted). Logically, only contract damages would be available for a breach of \r\n  the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  \r\n   \r\nIn view of our decision that tort \r\n  remedies are not available for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing in the employment context, it was improper for Williams to \r\n  collect punitive damages. As such, we need not address Riedman's argument that \r\n  there was no evidence of willful, wanton, or reckless conduct warranting recovery \r\n  of punitive damages.  \r\nIV. Election \r\n  of Remedies  \r\nRiedman argues the trial judge should \r\n  have granted its motion for election between the remedies for breach of contract \r\n  and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \r\n   \r\n\"Election of remedies involves a \r\n  choice between different forms of redress afforded by law for the same injury \r\n  or different forms of proceeding on the same cause of action.\" Taylor v. \r\n  Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 218, 479 S.E.2d 35, 44 (1996). The basic purpose \r\n  of election of remedies is to prevent double recovery for a single wrong. Save \r\n  Charleston Found. v. Murray, 286 S.C. 170, 333 S.E.2d 60 (Ct. App. 1985). \r\n  \"When an identical set of facts entitle the plaintiff to alternative remedies, \r\n  he may plead and prove his entitlement to either or both; however, the plaintiff \r\n  may not recover both.\" Id. at 175, 333 S.E.2d at 64. \r\n   \r\n Both the breach of contract and \r\n  the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing arose from Williams's \r\n  improper termination. In each case she was only entitled to recover damages \r\n  under the contract. Because we have determined the covenant of good faith and \r\n  fair dealing is an implied term of the employee manual, Riedman's breach of \r\n  that term and breach of express terms of the contract result in the same damages. \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, Williams must elect \r\n  between the breach of contract damages and the breach of the covenant of good \r\n  faith and fair dealing damages. If Williams elects to recover under the breach \r\n  of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, she is limited to the \r\n  verdict for $179,440 in actual damages because, as stated above, punitive damages \r\n  may not be recovered under this theory. \r\n   \r\nV. Jury Consideration \r\n  of Separate Non-Piracy Agreement  \r\n   \r\nRiedman argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in instructing the jury that it could not consider the counterclaim for breach \r\n  of the Non-Piracy Agreement if it found in favor of Williams on any cause of \r\n  action.   \r\nThe trial judge instructed the jury \r\n  as follows:  \r\nNow, in regard to the counter claim \r\n  that has been brought by the defendant. If you should conclude that the Plaintiff \r\n  is entitled to a verdict, then the counter claim would be of no concern to you. \r\n  But if you should conclude that the plaintiff is not entitled to a verdict, \r\n  then you would proceed to consider the defendant's counter claim.  \r\n   \r\nAlthough there are no South Carolina \r\n  state court decisions which specifically address this issue, we are persuaded \r\n  by the reasoning of a South Carolina United States District Court case. See \r\n  Associated Spring Corp. v. Roy F. Wilson &amp; Avnet, Inc., 410 F. Supp. \r\n  967 (D.S.C. 1976).   \r\nIn Associated Spring, Wilson \r\n  was hired by Associated Spring as a salesman. The employment contract contained \r\n  a two-year restrictive covenant which prohibited Wilson from soliciting sales \r\n  from Associated Spring's customers if he left the corporation. After approximately \r\n  two and a half years, Wilson resigned from the corporation. He asserted the \r\n  corporation breached the terms of the employment contract by making new sales \r\n  territory assignments and assigning Wilson's exclusive accounts to other salesmen. \r\n  Shortly after his resignation another corporation, Avnet, hired Wilson. Wilson \r\n  then began soliciting Associated Spring's customers on behalf of that corporation. \r\n  Subsequently, Associated Spring brought an action to enjoin Wilson from further \r\n  violating the restrictive covenant, and to enjoin Avnet from participating in \r\n  and benefitting from Wilson's violation of the covenant. Associated Spring also \r\n  sought actual and punitive damages for Wilson's and Avnet's past violations. \r\n  Wilson and Avnet admitted to violating the covenant, but contended the covenant \r\n  was unenforceable because of the corporation's prior breach of Wilson's employment \r\n  contract.  \r\nThe South Carolina United States \r\n  District Court, applying South Carolina law in this diversity action, found \r\n  Associated Spring's breach of the contract precluded it from enforcing the restrictive \r\n  covenant. Id. at 979. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on \r\n  equitable principles, primarily the \"clean hands\" doctrine and the doctrine \r\n  that one who seeks equity must do equity. Id. at 977-78. The Court found \r\n  these equitable principles superseded the contract provision which specifically \r\n  stated the restrictive covenant was independent from any other provision of \r\n  the agreement and would be enforceable despite a claim or cause of action against \r\n  the corporation. Id. at 977. \r\n   \r\nTurning to the instant case, Riedman \r\n  argues Associated Spring is inapplicable because the Non-Piracy Agreement \r\n  was separate or severable from the contract that Williams claimed altered her \r\n  at-will status. As such, the Non-Piracy Agreement was enforceable even if Riedman \r\n  breached the employment contract. Because the issue of whether a contract is \r\n  severable depends on the intent of the parties, which requires a factual determination \r\n  by the jury, Riedman contends the trial judge erred in instructing the jury \r\n  concerning Riedman's counterclaim. \r\n   \r\nAlthough the Non-Piracy Agreement \r\n  was given to Williams in the form of a letter which was separate and arguably \r\n  independent from the employment manual, this fact does not appear dispositive \r\n  in light of the analysis in Associated Spring. In Associated Spring, \r\n  the parties specifically agreed in a written contract that the restrictive covenant \r\n  was independent and enforceable despite a claim or cause of action against the \r\n  corporation. Nevertheless, the court held the corporation's breach precluded \r\n  it from enjoining Wilson from further violating the restrictive covenant and \r\n  from recovering damages for past violations. Here, there were no specific contractual \r\n  provisions, but rather, Williams's status as an at-will employee was altered \r\n  by the employee manual, related documents, and oral representations. Because \r\n  the contract is implied in this case, the reasoning in Associated Spring \r\n  is even more persuasive.  \r\nWe adopt the analysis in Associated \r\n  Spring for several reasons. First, the district court applied South Carolina \r\n  law in reaching its decision. Second, the Court's holding is consistent with \r\n  this state's contract law. See, e.g., Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto \r\n  Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 487, 514 S.E.2d 126, 135 (1999) (\"'[O]ne \r\n  who seeks to recover damages for breach of a contract, to which he was a party, \r\n  must show that the contract has been performed on his part, or at least that \r\n  he was, at the appropriate time, able, ready, and willing to perform it.'\" (quoting \r\n  Parks v. Lyons, 219 S.C. 40, 48, 64 S.E.2d 123, 126 (1951)). Finally, \r\n  the Associated Spring decision is consistent with the majority rule established \r\n  by other jurisdictions. Specifically, \"[i]t has been generally held that a restrictive \r\n  clause in an employment or business sale contract preventing future competition \r\n  by the employee or seller, or preventing an employee from performing services \r\n  for others during the existence of the employment relationship, may not be enforced \r\n  by the employer or a purchaser where there has been a breach by the latter of \r\n  his own obligations under the contract.\" See T. C. Williams, Annotation, \r\n  Restrictive Clause in Employment or Sales Contract to Prevent Future Competition \r\n  or Performance of Services for Others as Affected By Breach By Party Seeking \r\n  to Enforce It, of His Own Obligations Under the Contract, 155 A.L.R. 652, \r\n  654 (1945).  \r\nIn light of the foregoing, we find \r\n  the trial judge properly instructed the jury concerning Riedman's counterclaim \r\n  for breach of the Non-Piracy Agreement.\r\nVI. Trade \r\n  Secrets Act  \r\nRiedman argues the trial \r\n  judge erred in directing a verdict on the counterclaim for violation of the \r\n  Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-8-1 to -11 (Supp. 1996).(3) \r\n  Specifically, Riedman contends there was sufficient evidence to submit this \r\n  cause of action to the jury.\r\n  \r\nAlthough the threshold inquiry is \r\n  whether there is a trade secret to be protected, we are not required by the \r\n  facts of this case to make that initial determination. Lowndes Prods., Inc. \r\n  v. Brower, 259 S.C. 322, 191 S.E.2d 761 (1972) (The threshold issue in any \r\n  trade secrets case is not whether there was a confidential relationship or a \r\n  breach of contract or some other kind of misappropriation, but whether, there \r\n  was a trade secret to be misappropriated.). Assuming without deciding Riedman's \r\n  customer information constituted a trade secret, we find there was no evidence \r\n  Williams misappropriated this information.  \r\n   \r\nThe UTSA does not specifically address \r\n  employee misappropriation of trade secrets. The Act does, however, broadly define \r\n  the possible theories of misappropriation. Within this broad definition, we \r\n  believe the following provisions are applicable in this case:\r\n  \r\n(2) \"Misappropriation\" means:\r\n. . .\r\n(ii) disclosure or use of a trade \r\n  secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who\r\n. . .\r\n(B) at the time of disclosure or \r\n  use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was\r\n. . . \r\n  \r\n(II) acquired under circumstances \r\n  giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use . . ..\r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-1(2)(ii)(B)(II) \r\n  (Supp. 1996); see Kirk T. Bradley, Note, Employees Beware: Employer \r\n  Rights Under the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act, 49 S.C.L. Rev. 597, 603-08 \r\n  (1998); see also Richard E. Day, Protection of Trade Secrets in South \r\n  Carolina, 42 S.C.L.Rev. 689, 704 (1991).(4)\r\n  \r\nWhen Riedman purchased the Kay Agency \r\n  and hired Williams, Williams had a book of business which consisted of 148 clients. \r\n  Williams testified she acquired these customers over a six-year period. While \r\n  employed with Riedman, Williams acquired fifty-seven additional accounts. According \r\n  to Williams, the eleven clients she serviced at Web-Kor were from her original \r\n  148 accounts. She further testified that while employed with Riedman, she did \r\n  not gain any additional or \"secret information\" about these customers.\r\n  \r\nWhen Williams left Riedman she only \r\n  had customers' names. Because she had limited customer information, she \"had \r\n  to go in their office and they shared with [her] their policy limit, sales information, \r\n  payroll information, the same thing that they were giving other competitors \r\n  to compete against [Riedman].\" She did not have any \"memory or files or anything \r\n  to that nature that enabled [her] to compete more against him than anyone else.\" \r\n  She stated \"[t]he only thing that I had in my favor was my four or five year \r\n  relationship with that customer.\" \r\n   \r\nWilliams also denied she had a plan \r\n  to solicit Riedman customers after her termination. She testified the eleven \r\n  clients that transferred to Web-Kor contacted her. Two of these clients testified \r\n  on behalf of Williams.(5)  \r\n  \r\nNancy Kahrs, who was responsible \r\n  for obtaining insurance for one of Williams's clients, testified she had known \r\n  Williams for approximately eight years. Kahrs stated Williams had written insurance \r\n  for her company from the time she was employed with the Kay Agency. When Riedman \r\n  purchased the Kay Agency, Kahrs allowed her company's policy to remain with \r\n  Riedman because Williams continued to handle it. After Williams was terminated \r\n  by Riedman, Kahrs renewed her company's policy for another year with Riedman. \r\n  At the end of the renewal period, Kahrs became dissatisfied with the service \r\n  she had received from Riedman. As a result, she made the decision to put in \r\n  bids to six other insurance companies. One of those companies was Web-Kor. Kahrs \r\n  discovered Williams was employed with Web-Kor when she saw her at a meeting \r\n  the two regularly attended. Kahrs testified she ultimately chose Web-Kor because \r\n  its prices were competitive and she knew the kind of service she would receive \r\n  from Williams.\r\n  \r\nAnn Strickland, who was responsible \r\n  for procuring insurance for her company, testified she had known Williams since \r\n  the late 1970's. At the time Strickland began working with the company's insurance, \r\n  Williams was employed with the Kay Agency. Strickland stated she placed all \r\n  of her company's insurance with Williams because she received good service. \r\n  Strickland kept her insurance with Williams after Riedman purchased the Kay \r\n  Agency. After Williams was terminated from Riedman, Strickland became dissatisfied \r\n  with the service she received. When Strickland's company's policy came up for \r\n  renewal, she put in bids to other insurance companies. During this process, \r\n  Strickland called Williams at home. Williams indicated to Strickland that she \r\n  was looking for a job at several insurance companies, including Web-Kor. Strickland \r\n  contacted each of these companies and \"tracked down\" Williams at Web-Kor. Strickland \r\n  then placed some of her company's insurance with Web-Kor.\r\n  \r\n Although Riedman testified Williams \r\n  began calling his customers after she was terminated, the only evidence presented \r\n  to support this allegation was: (1) a letter from Richard Kay to Riedman stating \r\n  Williams had taken four accounts; (2) letters from former customers indicating \r\n  they were transferring their business to Web-Kor; and (3) Web-Kor memos signed \r\n  by Williams indicating these changes. \r\n  \r\nInitially, we note Riedman does not \r\n  contend, nor is there any evidence, that Williams took any tangible customer \r\n  information. In terms of using the customer information, we do not believe the \r\n  mere fact that a select number of Riedman's clients transferred to Web-Kor after \r\n  Williams's termination is sufficient to establish that Williams misappropriated \r\n  trade secrets. There is no evidence Williams actively solicited these customers. \r\n  Of the eleven clients Riedman claims Williams solicited, all eleven were clients \r\n  that she had serviced since her employment with the Kay Agency. Williams did \r\n  not obtain any additional information on these clients while employed with Riedman. \r\n  There is no evidence these clients' decision to transfer their business to Web-Kor \r\n  was the result of active solicitation on the part of Williams. \r\n  \r\nAs such, there is no evidence to \r\n  show Williams's actions constituted misappropriation of a trade secret. Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge properly directed a verdict on this cause of action. See \r\n  Rule 220(c), SCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment \r\n  upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\"); cf. Hilb, \r\n  Rogal &amp; Hamilton Ins. Servs. of Orange County, Inc. v. Robb, 39 Cal. \r\n  Rptr. 2d 887 (Ct. App. 1995) (Even assuming that insurance agency's customer \r\n  list and other client information constituted trade secrets, former employee \r\n  did not misuse them by informing some of agency's clients of his change of employment \r\n  and then complying with their instructions to move their accounts or seek quote \r\n  on desired type of insurance; UTSA did not prohibit clients from providing former \r\n  employee with information such as amount and types of insurance); Carolina \r\n  Chem. Equip. Co. v. Muckenfuss, 322 S.C. 289, 471 S.E.2d 721 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (where seller of industrial cleaning equipment and supplies brought action against \r\n  former employee for interference with contractual rights, misappropriation of \r\n  trade secrets, and breach of contract, trial judge erred in failing to grant \r\n  former employee's motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict on the trade secrets cause of action where there was no evidence \r\n  that former employee used or disclosed any trade secret of employer when former \r\n  employee, six months after the expiration of the noncompetition period, contacted \r\n  some of employer's customers and sold products similar to those of former employer \r\n  which were based on formulae that was readily available from suppliers of raw \r\n  materials).\r\n  \r\nVII. Requiring \r\n  of Second Round of Closing Arguments/ Denial of Mistrial\r\n  \r\nRiedman argues the trial judge's \r\n  decision to allow the conspiracy claim to go to the jury after granting a directed \r\n  verdict, and requiring that both attorneys present a second set of closing arguments \r\n  on that specific claim was prejudicial. Therefore, Riedman asserts the trial \r\n  judge erred in denying its motion for a mistrial. \r\n  \r\nPrior to the parties' closing arguments, \r\n  the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of Riedman on the conspiracy cause \r\n  of action. As such, Riedman's counsel did not discuss conspiracy during closing \r\n  arguments. Williams's counsel, however, referenced the conspiracy claim when \r\n  she stated that Riedman's counsel had \"sort of slopped off\" this cause of action \r\n  during closing arguments. The trial judge sustained Riedman's objection to this \r\n  comment.\r\n  \r\nAfter closing arguments, the trial \r\n  judge reversed his decision and permitted the conspiracy cause of action to \r\n  be submitted to the jury. As a result, he reopened closing arguments and permitted \r\n  counsel to address the conspiracy claim. Riedman's counsel objected to this \r\n  decision. She contended the ruling had the effect of emphasizing the conspiracy \r\n  claim to the jury. The trial judge overruled the objection, but stated he would \r\n  instruct the jury that counsel had misunderstood the court's prior ruling and \r\n  were not at fault. \r\n  \r\nAfter the additional closing arguments, \r\n  Riedman's counsel moved for a mistrial. Counsel asserted Riedman was prejudiced \r\n  by the trial judge's decision on the ground the additional closing arguments \r\n  emphasized to the jury the conspiracy cause of action. The trial judge denied \r\n  this motion. \r\n  \r\nThe conduct of trial is within the \r\n  discretion of the trial judge. We will not disturb the judge's decision absent \r\n  an abuse of that discretion or the commission of a legal error that resulted \r\n  in prejudice for Riedman. See Baber v. Greenville County, 327 \r\n  S.C. 31, 488 S.E.2d 314 (1997). The decision to grant a motion for a mistrial \r\n  rests within the trial judge's discretion and his ruling should not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal unless he abused his discretion. Tucker v. Reynolds, 268 S.C. \r\n  330, 233 S.E.2d 402 (1977).\r\n  \r\nRiedman has failed to show it was \r\n  prejudiced by the trial judge's decision to grant additional closing arguments. \r\n  First, the trial judge took full responsibility for the confusion which resulted \r\n  in the need for additional closing arguments. He also told the jurors that \"you're \r\n  to attach no particular significance to the particular argument more than any \r\n  other argument that you heard.\" Second, Riedman prevailed on the conspiracy \r\n  claim, so it is difficult to see how the allowance of the cause of action to \r\n  go to the jury and the additional time for closing arguments caused prejudice \r\n  sufficient to warrant overturning the trial judge's discretion.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  \r\nBecause there was sufficient evidence \r\n  to establish the existence of an employment contract and that it was breached \r\n  by Riedman, we affirm the trial judge's decision to deny Riedman's motions for \r\n  directed verdict on Williams's claims for breach of contract and breach of covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, we affirm the trial judge's decision: \r\n  1) to instruct the jury that it could only consider Riedman's counterclaim for \r\n  breach of the Non-Piracy Agreement if it did not find in favor of Williams on \r\n  any of her claims; 2) to grant Williams's motion for a directed verdict as to \r\n  Riedman's cause of action under the UTSA; and 3) to deny Riedman's motion for \r\n  a mistrial. We reverse the trial judge's finding that Williams's cause of action \r\n  for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a tort for which punitive \r\n  damages may be recovered. In light of this holding, we remand for Williams to \r\n  elect her remedy as between the breach of contract cause of action and the breach \r\n  of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs and \r\n  GOOLSBY, J., concurs in separate opinion.\r\n1.  At trial, \r\n  Riedman withdrew its counterclaim for breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent \r\n  act. Although the reason is unclear in the record, Williams's remaining causes \r\n  of actions for unfair trade practices and tortious interference with a contract \r\n  were not submitted to the jury. \r\n2.  We note that \r\n  several jurisdictions decline to recognize the applicability of an implied covenant \r\n  of good faith and fair dealing in an employment relationship. See, e.g., \r\n  Phipps v. IASD Health Servs. Corp., 558 N.W.2d 198 (Iowa 1997); Dahlman \r\n  v. Oakland Univ., 432 N.W.2d 304 (Mich. Ct. App. 1988); Hunt v. IBM Mid-America \r\n  Employees Fed. Credit Union, 384 N.W.2d 853 (Minn. 1986); Edelman v. \r\n  Franklin Iron &amp; Metal Corp., 622 N.E.2d 411 (Ohio Ct. App. 1993); Day \r\n  &amp; Zimmermann, Inc. v. Hatridge, 831 S.W.2d 65 (Tex. Ct. App. 1992); \r\n  Thompson v. St. Regis Paper Co., 685 P.2d 1081 (Wash. 1984) (en banc). \r\n   \r\n3.  Riedman \r\n  alleged Williams misappropriated its confidential customer information after \r\n  she was terminated in April 1995.(R.31-34) At that time, the Uniform Trade Secrets \r\n  Act was in effect. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-8-1 to -11 (Supp. 1996). \r\n  This Act was repealed on May 21,1997, by the South Carolina Trade Secrets Act. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-8-10 to -130 (Supp. 1999). The new Act applies \r\n  to causes of action which occur after July 1, 1997. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-130 \r\n  (Supp. 1999).  \r\n4.  We \r\n  note the General Assembly's 1997 enactment of the South Carolina Trade Secrets \r\n  Act specifically addressed employee misappropriation of trade secrets. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 39-8-30(B) (Supp. 1999) (\"Every employee who is informed of or should \r\n  reasonably have known from the circumstances of the existence of any employer's \r\n  trade secret has a duty to refrain from using or disclosing the trade secret \r\n  without the employer's permission independently of and in addition to any written \r\n  contract of employment, secrecy agreement, noncompete agreement, nondisclosure \r\n  agreement, or other agreement between the employer and the employee.\"); Kirk \r\n  T. Bradley, Note, Employees Beware: Employer Rights Under the South Carolina \r\n  Trade Secrets Act, 49 S.C.L. Rev. 597, 598 (1998).  \r\n5.  Williams \r\n  presented this evidence after she moved to dismiss Riedman's cause of action \r\n  based on the UTSA. At the close of her reply testimony, both parties generally \r\n  renewed their motions. The trial judge dismissed the cause of action after closing \r\n  arguments. In light of this procedural posture, this Court is entitled to review \r\n  the testimony of Williams's rebuttal witnesses in reaching our decision on this \r\n  issue. Cf. Stokes v. Denmark Emergency Med. Servs., 315 S.C. 263, \r\n  433 S.E.2d 850 (1993) (where party alleging trial judge erred in denying its \r\n  motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict presented \r\n  evidence after its first motion, appellate court was required to look at all \r\n  of the evidence in reviewing the denial of party's second motion made after \r\n  the close of all the evidence).  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
