Coleman, Arthur Caesar, and Scott A. Adamson.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 28, 2001, John Allen was working as a guard at the Kershaw Correctional Institution.Â  Another guard called for assistance with two inmates, Erving and Jones, who were causing a disturbance.Â  Allen, Caesar, and other guards responded and escorted Erving and Jones to the â€œspecial management unitâ€ located in an adjacent building.Â  As they were crossing the prison yard, Erving became aggressive toward Allen.Â  Allen sprayed Erving with mace and forced him to the ground.Â  While Allen had Erving on the ground, Jones jumped on Allen from behind and punched him on the back of his head and the side of his face.Â  \r\nAfter the altercation ended, Coleman, the highest-ranking guard on duty, spoke to the guards who were involved about the incident.Â  Coleman ordered Jones handcuffed and escorted to the â€œAâ€ buildingâ€™s holding cell.Â  Caesar and Adamson escorted Jones to the holding cell, and Coleman joined them en route. Â Caesar left briefly and returned with Allen.Â  Coleman ordered Jonesâ€™s handcuffs removed, and Allen pushed Jones from behind.Â  Allen and Jones then exchanged blows with Allen hitting, kicking, and biting Jones while the other guards, including Respondents, watched without intervening.Â  After one of the guards made the comment to Jones that he had â€œbetter not win,â€ Jones curled into a ball on the floor and Allen continued to kick him.Â  \r\nAfter Jones reported the incident, the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) investigated.Â  Although Allen originally denied the altercation occurred, he later confessed and assisted SLED in its investigation.Â  The grand jury indicted Respondents on the common law charge of misconduct in office.Â  \r\nAt the initial trial, Respondents made several objections to portions of the solicitorâ€™s opening statement.Â  The following colloquy took place:\r\n\r\nSolicitor Boganâ€™s Opening Statement:Â  As I mentioned to you, there are two incidents that occurred here.Â  The first one, the transfer from the Oak building holding cell to the Special Management Unit concerned a little scuffle that was handled fairly professionally by the officers, and then the second attitude adjustment if you will of inmate. . . \r\nDefense counsel Mr. Mills:Â  Your Honor, I object.Â  Heâ€™s getting into argument at this time.\r\nThe Court:Â  Iâ€™ll allow it.Â  Go ahead.\r\nMr. Bogan:Â  The second incident that occurred in the A building holding cell with inmate Jones and the six corrections officers.Â  How do you know that that took place dishonestly, corruptly?Â  The evidence will show in this case that the officers took the position that it never happened.\r\nDefense counsel Mr. Bell:Â  Your Honor, Iâ€™m going to object to that comment unless heâ€™s going to point to one particular officer.Â  My officer never took that position.Â  Iâ€™m going to object.Â  Thatâ€™s unfair comment that heâ€™s not going to be able to prove as to my client.Â  I canâ€™t speak for anybody else.\r\nThe Court:Â  Well, of course, youâ€™ll be able to address that in your opening, Mr. Bell, but Mr. Bogan, if itâ€™s comments that apply to only one of the defendants, you should identify or exclude the ones that it doesnâ€™t apply to.\r\n. . .\r\nMr. Bogan:Â  Ladies and Gentlemen, weâ€™ll present some testimony concerning what each of the defendants did, if anything, concerning the dishonesty and corruption that occurred in this case.Â  Consider this, no report, youâ€™ll hear testimony, was ever filed concerning - -\r\nMr. Bell:Â  Objection, Your Honor, I - - - the indictment charges me with what occurred on the 28th and nothing thereafter.Â  Iâ€™m going to object to the State trying to expand what he says I did wrong.Â  Itâ€™s not in the indictment, Your Honor.\r\nMr. Mills:Â  I join in - - -\r\nMr. Bell:Â  He cannot - - - He cannot convict me of something Iâ€™m not indicted in.\r\nDefense counsel Mr. Williams:Â  I also join in that.\r\nMr. Bell:Â  Iâ€™m not indicted on that.\r\nThe Court:Â  Mr. Bogan?\r\nMr. Bogan:Â  Thank you, Your Honor.Â  I contend that the fact that no report was ever filed and that the fact that the report that was filed only contained half the story is evidence of the dishonesty and the cover-up.\r\nMr. Bell:Â  I move for a mistrial, Your Honor.\r\nMr. Mills:Â  I would join the motion, Your Honor.\r\nMr. Williams:Â  I would join.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the trial judge excused the jury and heard arguments regarding the motion for a mistrial.Â  Respondentsâ€™ attorneys argued the solicitorâ€™s comments, characterizing the guardsâ€™ failure to file a report as a cover-up, went beyond the scope of the indictment.Â  The solicitor opposed the motion for a mistrial, arguing the guardsâ€™ failure to file a report was evidence of dishonesty, an element of the crime charged.Â  Although the trial judge stated he knew the solicitorâ€™s comments were â€œnot an intentional thing,â€ he granted a mistrial.Â  \r\nRespondentsâ€™ attorneys opposed beginning the trial anew the following day, so the case was rescheduled.Â  Before the case was called to trial for the second time, the solicitor obtained a superseding indictment containing language referencing the â€œcover-upâ€ to avoid another mistrial.Â  Subsequently, Respondentsâ€™ attorneys moved to dismiss the case based on double jeopardy.Â  After a hearing, the trial judge dismissed the case based on his finding that the solicitor â€œforced these Defendants into seeking a mistrial after jeopardy had attached.â€Â  The State appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the trial judge erred in dismissing the case based on the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.Â  We agree. \r\nThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions protect citizens from being twice placed in jeopardy of life or liberty.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. V (â€œNo person shall be . . . subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. . . .â€); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12 (â€œNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or liberty . . . .â€).Â  Under the law of double jeopardy, a defendant may not be prosecuted for the same offense after an acquittal, a conviction, or an improvidently granted mistrial.Â  State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 457, 539 S.E.2d 717, 718 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nIn Oregon v. Kennedy, the Supreme Court adopted a rule providing that a defendant who has moved for and been granted a mistrial may successfully invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent a second prosecution only when the prosecutorâ€™s conduct giving rise to the mistrial was intended to â€œgoadâ€ or provoke him into moving for the mistrial.Â  456 U.S. 667, 676-77 (1982).Â  See also State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 460, 597 S.E.2d 872, 877&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (applying same standard in South Carolina).Â  \r\nUnder this standard, the determination of whether double jeopardy attaches depends upon whether the prosecutorial misconduct was undertaken with the specific intent â€œto subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.â€Â  Mathis, 359 S.C. at 460, 597 S.E.2d at 877 (quoting Kennedy, 456 U.S. at 676).Â  The trial courtâ€™s finding concerning the prosecutorâ€™s intent is a factual one and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 460-61, 597 S.E.2d at 877-78. \r\nHere, there is clear error.Â  At the initial trial, the trial court specifically found the solicitorâ€™s comments did not intentionally provoke the Respondents into moving for a mistrial.Â  At the time of Respondentsâ€™ objection, after the jury was excused, the solicitor apologized to the court and stated he was, in good faith, trying to establish dishonesty, an element of the crime charged.Â  The trial judge concluded:\r\n\r\nI know that it was not an intentional thing.Â  I donâ€™t mean to imply that at all, but I - - - you know, my job is to make certain that these gentlemen get a fair trial. . . . And Iâ€™m just not certain - - - well, one, I am certain that you didnâ€™t intentionally do anything to cause that not to happen, but Iâ€™m certain that thereâ€™s no way to give them a curative instruction that would erase - - - erase it from their mind, and for that reason, Iâ€™m going to grant a mistrial in this case. \r\n\r\nIn the order of dismissal based on double jeopardy, the trial court considered this statement by the solicitor:Â  â€œI contend that the fact that no report was ever filed and the fact that the report that was filed only contained half the story as evidence of the dishonesty and cover-up.â€Â  The trial court concluded the solicitor forced Respondents to move for a mistrial â€œbecause it was the third time the Prosecutor had made this statement before the jury after twice being instructed not to. . . .â€Â  \r\nHowever, the record conclusively shows the objections to the solicitorâ€™s first two comments were on other grounds.Â  The ground for the first objection was for exceeding the scope of the opening statement and â€œgetting into argument.â€Â  The second objection dealt with the solicitorâ€™s failure to differentiate between the three defendants.Â  We fail to see, based on the record, any intent by the solicitor to force a mistrial.Â  The trial court overruled the first objection.Â  The trial court essentially ruled again for the solicitor on the second objection, although the court also cautioned the solicitor to differentiate between the defendants.Â  The last objection, and the only one on the grounds giving rise to the double jeopardy issue, resulted in the motion for mistrial even before there was a ruling on the objection by the trial court.Â  \r\nBased on the record, there is only one reasonable inference.Â  Under the facts of this case, the solicitorâ€™s conduct was unintentional as a matter of law.Â  Accordingly, we find that the Double Jeopardy Clause is no bar to Respondentsâ€™ retrial.Â  The order of the trial court is \r\n REVERSED.\r\n ANDERSON and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4009","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of John Phillip Corley","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4009","description":"The court of appeals found Rule 52(a), SCRCP, requires findings of fact and conclusions of law in annual probable cause determination hearings required under South Carolinaâ€™s Sexually Violent Predator Act.

Loebl, of Augusta, Georgia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Following a determination, pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act), that John Phillip Corley is a sexually violent predator, a probable cause hearing was held on the issue of whether the results of the statutory annual review warranted a trial to determine if Corley should be released from confinement.Â  Corley appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s finding that there was no probable cause to believe his mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that he was safe to be at large and that he was not likely to commit acts of sexual violence.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 1993, a jury convicted Corley of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and he was sentenced to ten years.Â  In August 1993, Corley pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct in the second degree and was sentenced to a concurrent term of fourteen years.Â  \r\nA jury subsequently found Corley to be a sexually violent predator and he was committed pursuant to the Act.Â  The judgment was affirmed on appeal.Â  In the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003).Â  In May 2003, Corley petitioned the court for release from commitment pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-110 (Supp. 2002).[1]Â  \r\nThe circuit court held a probable cause hearing in September 2003 to determine whether the results of Corleyâ€™s annual review warranted a trial on the issue of his fitness for release.Â  Following the submission of written reports and arguments by counsel, the court found probable cause did not exist to believe Corleyâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that he was safe to be at large and unlikely to commit acts of sexual violence.Â  Corley challenges the circuit courtâ€™s finding of no probable cause. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sufficiency of the Order\r\nSection 44-48-110 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2002)â€”which was applicable at the time of Corleyâ€™s September 2003 hearingâ€”set forth the procedure for reviewing commitments under the Act.Â  A person committed under the Act must have an annual examination of his mental conditions.Â  Id.Â  The court must conduct an annual hearing to review the committed personâ€™s status, and the committed person may petition the court for release at this hearing.Â  Id.Â  At the hearing, the circuit court uses a probable cause standard to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to go to trial:Â  \r\n\r\nIf the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the personâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe to be at large and, if released, is not likely to commit acts of sexual violence, the court shall schedule a trial on the issue.Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â \r\nIn this case, the circuit court conducted an annual review hearing and determined that probable cause did not exist to warrant a trial on Corelyâ€™s request for release from confinement.Â  The court considered the evidence and determined that the lack of the requisite probable cause precluded a further hearing or trial.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s conclusory order appears to be a form order submitted by the State.Â  Corley maintains that the circuit courtâ€™s order failed to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law to permit judicial review.\r\nThe first question before us, which we answer in the affirmative, is whether the circuit court must make detailed findings in connection with a probable cause determination in an annual review under the Act.Â  We find especially persuasive our supreme courtâ€™s sound analysis in In the Matter of the Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002).Â  The court held in Luckabaugh that the circuit court erred in failing to set forth its findingsâ€”and violating Rule 52(a), SCRCPâ€”in an initial merits hearing under the Act.[2]Â  Luckabaugh recognizes the obviousâ€”meaningful appellate review is more readily obtained when we are presented with a clear presentation of the basis for the circuit courtâ€™s findings:\r\n\r\nTrial courts, sitting without juries in an action at law, write their findings specially and separately: \r\n  \r\nto allow a reviewing court to determine from the record whether the judgmentâ€”and the legal conclusions which underlie itâ€”represent a correct application of the law.Â  The requirement for appropriately detailed findings is thus not a mere formality or a rule of empty ritual;Â  it is designed instead to dispose of the issues raised by the pleadings and to allow the appellate courts to perform their proper function in the judicial system. \r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 132, 568 S.E.2d at 343 (internal citations omitted) (quoting Coble v. Coble, 268 S.E.2d 185, 189 (N.C. 1980)). \r\nThere are, to be sure, innumerable instances where the strictures of Rule 52(a) do not apply.Â  Trial courts routinely make rulings in a variety of settings (preliminary to, and in the context of a, trial) without the need to issue a formal order containing specific findings of fact.Â  â€œWe do not require a lower court to set out findings on all the myriad factual questions arising in a particular case.â€Â  Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 133, 568 S.E.2d at 343.Â  We are not presented here with a mere evidentiary ruling or some peripheral determination.Â  An annual review hearing under the Act is in the nature of a trial.Â  A finding of â€œno probable causeâ€ is indeed dispositive of the proceeding and provides the finding from which an appeal is taken.[3]\r\nÂ We hold that, in making a probable cause determination in an annual review under the Act, the circuit court should substantially comply with Rule 52(a) and â€œfind the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law.â€ \r\nWe do not find, however, that the deficient order requires reversal.Â  Unlike the uncertainty that surrounded the circuit courtâ€™s determination in Luckabaugh, a review of this record clearly documents a factual basis for concluding that probable cause was lacking.Â  From the comments of and questions posed by the able circuit judge, we need not speculate as to the basis of his decision, for we clearly discernâ€”as discussed belowâ€”the basis of his finding of no probable cause. \r\nII.Â  Probable Cause Finding\r\nConcerning Corleyâ€™s challenge to the circuit courtâ€™s probable cause finding, such ruling will not be disturbed â€œunless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the hearing courtâ€™s finding.â€Â  In the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of Tucker, 353 S.C. 466, 470, 578 S.E.2d 719, 721 (2003).Â  \r\nEvidence reasonably supports the circuit courtâ€™s probable cause finding.Â  Although Corley made progress, his behavior remained â€œa big problem.â€Â  He received at least five major disciplinary citations in the year prior to the review, some of which involved his â€œmanipulating to use the telephoneâ€ to make sexually inappropriate calls.Â  Corley had been involved in a sexual relationship with a staff member, and had threatened staff.Â  Additionally, he had numerous unexcused absences from group sessions.Â  Corley had not completed treatment.Â Â  At the time of the hearing, he was on the lowest level in the Treatment Incentive Program due to his inappropriate behavior on the unit.Â  \r\nDr. Lanette Atkins testified Corley needs further treatment.Â  Dr. Atkins further testified that based on Corleyâ€™s history of assaultive behavior and continuing manipulative behavior, he continues to be a risk to the community.Â  \r\nIn response, Corley offered the testimony of Carl Harry Douglas, a counselor who treats sex offenders in an outpatient setting.Â  Douglas testified Corley would need to continue in outpatient treatment if he were released.Â  However, the Act contains no provision for court-ordered outpatient treatment.Â  \r\nWe find ample support to sustain the circuit courtâ€™s finding of no probable cause.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Constitutional Challenge to the Act\r\nCorley further requests a ruling that the Act is invalid on due process grounds.Â  This argument has not been preserved for appeal.Â  \r\nConstitutional issues, like most others, must be raised to and ruled on by the trial court to be preserved for appeal.Â  See State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 339, 526 S.E.2d 248, 250 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The record contains no indication that Corley ever raised a due process argument in the circuit court.Â  This argument is not preserved for review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that the circuit courtâ€™s probable cause determination is supported by the evidence.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Act was amended in 2004.Â  â€œThe 2004 amendment substituted â€˜mustâ€™ for â€˜shallâ€™ throughout and added [a] sentence relating to notification of the victim.â€Â  See Effect of Amendment, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-44-110 (Supp. 2004).Â  This appeal is unaffected by the 2004 amendment. \r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 52(a) provides as follows:Â  â€œIn all actions tried upon the facts without a jury . . . , the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to Rule 58 (providing for entry of judgment) . . . .â€Â  Rule 52(a), SCRCP.\r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the family court context, Rule 26(a), SCFCR, provides a counterpart to Rule 52(a), SCRCP.Â  When considering family court orders deemed conclusory, and thus incapable of proper judicial review, this court noted in Atkinson v. Atkinson, 279 S.C. 454, 456, 309 S.E.2d 14, 15 (Ct. App. 1983):Â  \r\nProper appellate review is extremely difficult, if not impossible, where a lower court order omits specific findings of fact to support its legal conclusions. We appreciate the problems that Family Court Judges may have from time to time in meeting the requirements of [Rule 26(a)]. Unremitting workloads and arduous responsibilities hamstring even the most dedicated. Nonetheless, we believe that strict compliance with the rule promotes the administration of justice at every judicial level.\r\nWe echo the sentiments of the court in Atkinson, and recognize that a trial courtâ€™s specific findings of fact and conclusions of law are critical to meaningful appellate review.Â  We do not intend to unnecessarily increase our trial courtsâ€™ substantial existing burdens, but instead our goal is to seek greater efficiency in the â€œadministration of justiceâ€ by facilitating proper appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4010","title":"Matthews v.

Jenkinson, of Kingstree, for Appellants.\r\nS. Porter Stewart, II, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gloria and Alton Dennis (â€œDefendantsâ€) appeal the special refereeâ€™s determination that their property was subject to an easement in favor of adjoining property owned by Ruby E. Matthews, Bobby J. Matthews, and David McCoy (collectively referred to as â€œPlaintiffsâ€).Â  Specifically, the special referee found Plaintiffs established their right to an easement under the theories of prescription and necessity.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nGloria Dennis and Ruby Matthews are first cousins.Â  In 1946, Otis McKnight, who was Gloriaâ€™s father and Rubyâ€™s uncle, built a home place on a tract of land that he owned in Florence County, South Carolina.Â  This property, consisting of about twenty-one and one-half acres of farmland, was adjacent to a tract of land owned by Otisâ€™s brother.Â  \r\nIn 1951, Otis received from his brother a thirty-foot-wide strip of land, running approximately one-quarter of a mile between their respective properties.Â  According to the deed of conveyance, the property, commonly known as â€œHawk Lane,â€ was â€œto be used as a roadbed leading from Anderson Bridge road to [the] home of Otis McKnight.â€Â  The deed also noted that G.M. Evans, Rubyâ€™s father, helped to stake out the property and that Bobby Matthews, Sr., Rubyâ€™s now deceased husband, was present when this took place.Â  Other than Hawk Lane, there is no documented legal access to Otisâ€™s property, and the location of the roadway has not changed since the time that Otis acquired it.Â  \r\nIn 1963, Otis conveyed a one-acre portion of his land to Defendants, who have lived on this property since 1964. In 1969, Otis transferred his remaining property to Bobby Matthews, Sr., while reserving a life estate for himself and his wife in the one acre of land where their home was located.Â  Upon Otisâ€™s death in 1976, his remaining property transferred to his widow and children.Â  By deed dated April 23, 1986, Otisâ€™s heirs transferred their interest in Hawk Lane to Defendants.Â  \r\nIn 1970, Bobby Matthews, Sr., transferred a portion of the property that he received from McKnight to other individuals.Â  Two roads, Vansel and Farmer Roads, border the property.Â  The testimony differed in regards to whether the roads were in existence at the time of the 1970 transfer.Â  In 1984, Bobby Matthews, Sr., transferred the remainder of his property to Ruby.Â  In 1998, Ruby transferred a one-acre parcel to her nephew, David McCoy.Â  In 2002, she transferred her remaining property to her son, Bobby J. Matthews, while reserving a life estate for herself.\r\nPlaintiffsâ€™ property is presently bounded by land owned by the McAllister family.Â  A roadbed known as McAllister Lane traverses the McAllister property and is within a quarter-mile from Rubyâ€™s home.\r\nThe Matthews have rented the McAllister property for farming.Â  With permission from the McAllisters, they have periodically used McAllister Lane for access to and from their property; however, Hawk Lane has always been the main access route.\r\nA dispute over the use of Hawk Lane resulted in an attempt by Defendants to block Plaintiffsâ€™ access to the road in July 2000.Â  This prompted Plaintiffs to bring the instant action to have an easement declared over Hawk Lane for access to their property.Â  In their complaint, they alleged they had an easement by prescription, necessity, or dedication.Â  Defendants denied Plaintiffsâ€™ right to an easement and sought an injunction prohibiting their use of Hawk Lane.\r\nThe case was transferred to a special referee, who found (1) Plaintiffs had both a prescriptive easement and an easement by necessity to use Hawk Lane to access their property, but (2) Plaintiffs failed to prove Hawk Lane had been dedicated to public use.Â  Following the denial of their motion for reconsideration, Defendants appealed.[2]Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Citing the Maine case of Rollins v. Blackden,[3] Defendants first assert the 1986 conveyance of Hawk Lane to them by the heirs of Otis McKnight â€œinterruptedâ€ the use of the property and, therefore, the time for calculating the twenty years necessary for a prescriptive easement should have started in 1986.Â  They also contend the twenty-year prescriptive period could not begin to run against them until they acquired title to the property in 1986 because they could not have sued to enjoin the use of a road that they did not own.Â  To the extent these arguments have been preserved for appeal, we find they are without merit.[4]\r\nCreation of a prescriptive easement requires the following:Â  â€œ(1) There must be [a] continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of the right for a period of 20 years.Â  (2) The identity of the thing enjoyed must be proven.Â  (3) The use must have been adverse or under a claim of right.â€[5]Â  â€œPeriods of prescriptive use may be tacked together to make up the prescriptive period if there is a transfer between the prescriptive users of either the inchoate servitude or the estate benefited by the inchoate servitude.â€[6]Â  \r\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs have used Hawk Lane continuously, openly, and without interruption since at least 1969 for ingress and egress to their property.Â  As late as 1998, the Florence Municipal/County Planning Department approved a plat that was prepared for David McCoy for the installation of a well and septic system on the Matthews property and depicted Hawk Lane as the only access to the property.Â  Hawk Lane has been identified by Florence County with a standard blue road sign, and, as testified by Alton Dennis, is part of the emergency 9-1-1 system.Â  It also appears the twenty-year prescriptive period ran long before Defendantsâ€™ initial attempt to barricade Hawk Lane, which, according to Ruby, was about eight years before the final hearing in this case.[7]Â  Under these circumstances, we hold the evidence in the record supports the special refereeâ€™s finding that Plaintiffs successfully established uninterrupted use of Hawk Lane for at least twenty years.[8]Â  The fact that Hawk Lane was conveyed to Defendants during the prescriptive period did not interrupt Plaintiffsâ€™ use of the roadway. [9] \r\n2.Â  We disagree with Defendantsâ€™ argument that Plaintiffsâ€™ claim of right was insufficient because it was based on a mistaken belief of ownership. \r\nA party claiming a prescriptive easement under a claim of right must â€œdemonstrate a substantial belief that he had the right to use the parcel or road based upon the totality of circumstances surrounding his use.â€[10]\r\nWe hold the record supports the special refereeâ€™s finding that â€œPlaintiffs have established that theirs has always been a belief that they have had a right to use of the subject roadway for ingress and egress, and had openly done so for well in excess of twenty years.â€Â  Ruby testified that members of her family had always used Hawk Lane for access while acknowledging they may not have had legal documents granting them the right to do this.Â  Moreover, this case is distinguishable from Babb v. Harrison,[11] which Defendants cite in support of their position.Â  Whereas the party asserting the easement in Babb based her initial claim on one of ownership of the property over which she asserted a right of use, the testimony in the present case reflects that Plaintiffs believed that they had only the right to use Hawk Lane; there is no suggestion that they ever believed they owned Hawk Lane itself. [12] Â  \r\n3.Â  Finally, Defendants argue Plaintiffsâ€™ use of the road should be deemed permissive because of the family relationship between the parties.Â  We disagree.\r\n Lynch v. Lynch,[13] which Defendants cite in support of their position, is distinguishable from the present case.Â  Lynch concerned a claim of adverse possession and not a claim for a prescriptive easement.Â  Moreover, that decision addresses only immediate family relationships, such as between siblings or parent and child, rather than extended kinship, such as in the present case.Â  In any event, based on case law from both South Carolina and other jurisdictions, we see no reason to hold that the degree of affinity between the parties in this case is by itself sufficient reason to reverse the special refereeâ€™s finding that Plaintiffs met their burden of proof in establishing their right to a prescriptive easement. [14] \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  We address only those arguments challenging the special refereeâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding an easement by prescription.Â  Because we affirm the determination that Plaintiffs had established their right to an easement under this theory, we make no ruling on their entitlement to an easement by necessity.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal); Dwyer v.

Brandt, of Walhalla, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina T. Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  William Max Nicholson appeals his convictions for three counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe trial in this case revolved around the accusations of a young adult male who was born March 25, 1980.Â  In late 2001, he told his mother that Nicholson sexually assaulted him several years earlier.Â  \r\nOn December 21, 2001, the accuser gave a written statement about the alleged assaults to the Oconee County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  According to the statement, the accuser first met Nicholson, a high school science teacher, when he was a ninth-grade student in Nicholsonâ€™s physical science class at West Oak High School.Â  The accuser participated in tasks such as setting up labs and cleaning up chemical spills.Â  Eventually, he began to receive small sums of money from Nicholson for this work.Â  At that time, the accuser was not approached in a sexual manner.Â  \r\nAfter the school year ended, the accuser, at Nicholsonâ€™s request, began doing odd jobs around Nicholsonâ€™s house and receiving payment from Nicholson for his services.Â  Although the accuser could not remember exactly how Nicholson approached him, he related that the â€œincidentsâ€ began only after â€œa few times of doing the workâ€ and that they were â€œin the nature of oral sexâ€ performed by Nicholson on him.Â  \r\nThe following school year, the accuser was initially enrolled at Walhalla High School, but later transferred back to West Oak High School.Â  After he transferred back to West Oak, he visited Nicholsonâ€™s classroom frequently even though he did not have Nicholson for class.Â  During the summer, the accuser helped Nicholson move to another residence.Â  Although the move was completed before the end of the summer, Nicholson offered the accuser additional work, promising the pay would be fair and a bonus was possible.Â  Throughout the completion of those tasks, the oral sex continued, probably at least every other day, for the duration of the summer.Â  When the accuser reached eleventh grade, he continued his relationship with Nicholson and claimed that he received at least a thousand dollars per month for his companionship.Â  The incidents became less frequent when the accuser reached twelfth grade, and he surmised this was because he was approaching adulthood and Nicholsonâ€™s â€œfascination was strictly adolescent males.â€Â  Even so, the accuser claimed that he visited Nicholson at various times in the month preceding the investigation and that Nicholson paid him a total of about one thousand dollars during that time. \r\nAs part of the investigation, law enforcement officers outfitted the accuser with a recording device and sent him to Nicholsonâ€™s home on two occasions for the express purpose of eliciting incriminating statements from Nicholson.Â  They also videotaped Nicholsonâ€™s home while Nicholson and his accuser were inside talking and filmed the accuser on the porch talking with Nicholson as the accuser was preparing to leave the premises.Â  Although Nicholson made no direct admissions on the tape, he did not refute statements by the accuser.\r\nAuthorities arrested Nicholson on January 2, 2002.Â  After a preliminary hearing on February 22, 2002, and February 26, 2002, the Oconee County Grand Jury issued three indictments against Nicholson for second-degree criminal sexual conduct, charging him with committing acts of fellatio on his accuser during the periods of June 1 through June 30, 1995; July 1 through July 31, 1995; and August 1 through August 18, 1995.Â  \r\nAfter a jury trial commencing October 21, 2002, Nicholson was convicted on all three indictments and sentenced to twelve years.Â  After the trial judge denied his post-trial motions, Nicholson filed this appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Nicholson argues the trial judge should have dismissed the indictments because the time periods alleged were not sufficiently specific.Â  In particular, he complains that without more specific dates in the indictments, he could not avail himself of the defense of alibi and other testimony that could have refuted his accuserâ€™s claims or impeached his accuserâ€™s credibility.Â  We reject these arguments.\r\nâ€œWhere time is not an essential element of the offense, the indictment need not specifically charge the precise time the offense allegedly occurred.â€[1]Â  â€œ[T]he sufficiency of an indictment must be judged from a practical standpoint, with all of the circumstances of the particular case in mind.â€[2]Â  \r\nIn this case, time was not an essential element of the charged offenses.[3]Â  Moreover, although Nicholson argued in his brief that the trial judge should have, in the alternative, required the State to make the dates of the offenses more definite and certain, we do not see any indication in the record that this issue was clearly raised at trial.[4]\r\n2.Â  We disagree with Nicholsonâ€™s argument that the trial judge erred in denying his directed verdict motion.\r\nUnder Rule 19(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure, â€œthe court shall direct a verdict in the defendantâ€™s favor on any offense charged in the indictment after the evidence on either side is closed, if there is a failure of competent evidence tending to prove the charge in the indictment.â€[5]Â  In considering a directed verdict motion, the court â€œshall consider only the existence or non-existence of the evidence and not its weight.â€[6]Â  â€œIf there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€[7]Â  \r\nAt the close of the testimony, Nicholson moved for a directed verdict on the ground that there was â€œno credible evidence as to all the elements upon which the burden of proof lies upon the State.â€Â  On appeal, he alleges there were inconsistencies and time gaps in the accuserâ€™s testimony and suggests, among other things, that the evidence supported a finding that the alleged abuse occurred after the accuserâ€™s sixteenth birthday and was therefore outside the statutory age limit for the offense with which he was charged.[8]Â  We agree with the trial judge, however, that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, Nicholson was not entitled to a directed verdict.\r\nThe accuser testified Nicholson performed oral sex on him â€œthroughout the summerâ€ of 1995.Â  Specifically, he averred the oral sex happened in June, July, and August of 1995, and at a frequency of two to three times per week.Â  There was no dispute that the accuserâ€™s date of birth was March 25, 1980, which would have made him under the age of sixteen during the summer of 1995.Â  It further appears uncontested that he was younger than Nicholson and had been a student in Nicholsonâ€™s class, which would have placed Nicholson in a â€œposition of familial, custodial, or official authority to coerce the victim to submit.â€[9]Â  Any concerns about contradictory statements by the accuser, whether on the stand or outside the courtroom setting, were ultimately about his credibility and therefore in the domain of the jury.[10]\r\n3.Â  Nicholson also contends he was deprived of a fair trial because the presiding trial judge instructed the solicitor on how to introduce a piece of evidence against him.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring the trial, the solicitor sought to introduce into evidence a composite audiotape recording of conversations between Nicholson and his accuser that took place on December 20 and 27, 2001.Â  While the solicitor was attempting to lay a foundation for admission of the recording, the trial judge, apparently dissatisfied with the solicitorâ€™s line of questioning, undertook to advise her outside the presence of the jury about the particulars that he viewed as necessary steps in this procedure.Â  Nicholson objected to the â€œdepth and detailâ€ of the assistance to the State.Â  After a recess, the solicitor, following the trial judgeâ€™s advice, made a successful proffer of the tape.\r\nWe find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s intervention in this case.Â  In State v. Gaskins, the supreme court, quoting State v. Anderson, reiterated the following â€œduties and limitationsâ€ that a trial judge must observe while conducting a trial:\r\n\r\nA grave responsibility rests upon a trial judge.Â  It is his duty to see to it that justice be done in every case, if it can be done according to law; and, if he thinks that the attorney for either party, either from inadvertence or any other cause, has failed to ask the witnesses the questions necessary and proper to bring out all the testimony which tends to ascertain the truth of the matter under investigation, we can see no legal objection to his propounding such questions; but, of course, he should do so in a fair and impartial manner, and should not by the form or manner of his questions express or indicate to the jury his opinion as to the facts of the case, or as to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence.[11]\r\n\r\nIn our view, the trial judge did not exceed the limits recognized in Gaskins.Â  The jury was absent from the courtroom when the exchange at issue took place and thus could not have been affected by the trial judgeâ€™s remarks.Â  Moreover, the trial judge, when explaining to counsel what he required to lay a foundation, did not show any favoritism or otherwise indicate he had an opinion about the case.Â  We therefore hold that, contrary to Nicholsonâ€™s argument, the instructions did not result in the trial judgeâ€™s assumption of an adversarial role in the case.[12]\r\n4.Â  Nicholson next argues the trial judge erred in refusing to strike a juror for cause.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the voir dire, the trial judge asked if any members of the jury panel or their close personal friends or family members had been victims or claimed to be victims of any type of sexual offense or child abuse.Â  Among those answering the question in the affirmative was Juror Number 98, who advised the trial judge that his sister-in-law had been raped and the perpetrators â€œgot away with itâ€ and â€œ[i]t was pretty ugly.â€Â  Notwithstanding this information, Juror Number 98 was not dismissed for cause.Â  Nicholson argues on appeal that, during jury selection, he was forced to use one of his peremptory challenges to excuse this particular juror, which ultimately resulted in the seating of another juror whom he maintains he would have excused but for the exhaustion of all his peremptory strikes.Â  \r\nNicholsonâ€™s argument before the trial judge and on appeal focuses on the jurorâ€™s apparently â€œdeeply troubledâ€ demeanor and answer to a follow-up question from the trial judge that suggested that he could not be fair and impartial.Â  In the colloquy, it is evident that, when initially examining the juror, the trial judge asked two questions in immediate succession.Â  Whereas the first question called for a negative response from a qualified juror, the second question called for an affirmative answer.Â  To clear up the confusion, the trial judge impressed upon the juror the importance of a fair trial for both sides, inquiring of him, â€œCould you do that?â€ The juror responded affirmatively.Â  The trial judge also rephrased the other question, asking the juror, â€œAnd it would not interfere with your ability to be fair to the State and the defendant?â€ To this question the juror replied, â€œI donâ€™t think so.â€Â  Based on these exchanges, we hold the trial judge conducted an adequate examination into the jurorâ€™s impartiality and acted within his discretion in qualifying Juror Number 98.[13]\r\n5.Â  During closing argument, the solicitor referred to Nicholsonâ€™s counsel as an â€œexperienced defense attorney,â€ which, Nicholson contends, may have suggested to the jury he was guilty because he hired experienced counsel.Â  The solicitor also made references about â€œjustice for allâ€ and advised the jurors that, in reaching a verdict, they could consider the trauma of the trial on Nicholsonâ€™s accuser.Â  Nicholson asserts the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on these allegedly improper comments.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.[14]Â  Nicholson failed to make a contemporaneous objection to either remark,[15] and, although the trial judge declined to declare a mistrial, he issued a curative instruction.[16]\r\n6.Â  We reject Nicholsonâ€™s argument that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant his motion to suppress the testimony of an expert witness offered by the State or, in the alternative, to grant a continuance so he could obtain his own expert on the subject.Â  The witness was called to testify about the general characteristics of a sex abuse victim.Â  Nicholson contends the notice he received from the State about this witness was too close in time to the trial for him to prepare his defense.Â  The State, however, is not required to provide its witness list to a criminal defendant,[17] and the disclosure in the present case of this witness to the defense before trial was nothing more than a professional courtesy.Â  We therefore hold that the trial judge properly declined to suppress the expert testimony and acted within his discretion in refusing to continue the case.[18]\r\n7.Â  Next, Nicholson asserts the trial judge should have required the State to release records concerning two psychological evaluations that had been performed on his accuser during a family court proceeding between the accuserâ€™s parents.Â  Nicholson further alleges the trial judge erred in limiting cross-examination of the accuser about his mental health history and in denying the defense â€œsufficient time and opportunity to effectively process certain information.â€Â  We find no error.\r\nThe records that Nicholson sought were not in the Stateâ€™s possession; and the trial judge did not allow full access of the documents to either the State or to the defense.Â  After receiving the records under seal and reviewing them for admissibility, the trial judge â€œdeclined to admit it based on the confidential nature of the reportâ€ and further noted that any probative value in the records would be outweighed by the fact that they were â€œremoteâ€ and â€œsomewhat cumulative.â€Â  We hold the trial judge followed the correct procedure in determining whether Nicholson could have access to his accuserâ€™s psychological evaluations and whether the evaluations were admissible.[19]Â  Moreover, we have reviewed the records, which were submitted to this court under seal, and concur with the trial judge that the evaluations were so remote in time they would render questionable any probative information they might yield in the present case.\r\n8.Â  Nicholson asserts recordings by law enforcement of the conversations between him and his accuser should have been suppressed because they amounted to a denial of his right to counsel, an invasion of his privacy, and an unreasonable search and seizure.Â  We disagree.Â  When the tapes were made, Nicholson was not in police custody and had not been indicted.[20]Â  In addition, there was no dispute that the accuser in this case consented to have his conversations with Nicholson recorded.[21]\r\n9.Â  Finally, Nicholson contends the cumulative effect of the errors he has alleged warrants a new trial.[22]Â  Because, however, we have determined that the trial judge did not err in any of the particulars alleged in this appeal, we likewise hold the cumulative error doctrine is inapplicable.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  State v.

Fenno, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Joseph A. Berger appeals the trial courtâ€™s order assessing attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $39,194.08 in favor of Seabrook Island Property Ownersâ€™ Association (Seabrook).Â  Berger argues the award is excessive and the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow him to testify in person at trial.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case arises out of a dispute between Berger, who is a resident of Seabrook Island, and Seabrook.Â  The dispute began in 1997 when Seabrook notified Berger that his floating dock and unkempt yard violated Seabrookâ€™s covenants.Â  Seabrook alerted Berger to the violations on numerous occasions and informed him of assessments he was incurring for failing to remedy the problems.Â  After Berger neglected to correct the violations, Seabrook referred the matter to its attorney, David Wheeler, for enforcement and collection. \r\nOver the course of the next couple of years, Wheeler and his associates sent many letters to Berger and his attorneys.Â  Wheeler followed up with numerous attempts to resolve the matter.Â  After these attempts failed, Seabrook filed suit against Berger seeking injunctive relief and recovery of assessments levied for violations of the covenants.Â  The case was tried before Judge Roger M. Young who granted Seabrook injunctive relief, $43,945, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in an amount to be determined.Â  \r\nBerger appealed Judge Youngâ€™s order.Â  The attorneyâ€™s fees determination was stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.Â  We affirmed Judge Youngâ€™s order in an unpublished opinion. Â Seabrook Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Berger, Op. No. 2003-UP-417 (Ct. App. filed June 19, 2003).Â  \r\nOn December 10, 2003, Seabrook petitioned the trial court to render an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, and included itemized invoices detailing the costs it incurred.Â  Thereafter, Berger requested a hearing, and the matter was set for February 23, 2004 before Judge Mikell R. Scarborough.Â  At the hearing, Bergerâ€™s attorney requested that Berger be permitted to testify to contest specific items in the bills.Â  The judge declined the request due to time considerations, but allowed Berger to submit a post-hearing affidavit setting forth his testimony.Â  The trial judge further requested that Berger provide information about his own attorneyâ€™s fees and asked him to outline why he thought Seabrookâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees were excessive.Â  \r\nAfter reviewing Bergerâ€™s affidavit, the trial judge ruled that Seabrook had established the reasonableness of its attorneyâ€™s fees and awarded Seabrook attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $39,194.08.Â  Berger filed a motion to vacate, alter, or amend the judgment and requested an opportunity to testify in person.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Reasonableness of Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nBerger argues the trial courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be vacated or reduced because it was excessive and punitive in nature.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe general rule is that attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc.,&nbsp; 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660&nbsp;(1993) (citing Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989); Hegler v. Gulf Ins.

Collins, 239 S.C. 170, 122 S.E.2d 1 (1961)).Â  â€œIn South Carolina, the authority to award attorneyâ€™s fees can come only from a statute or be provided for in the language of a contract.Â  There is no common law right to recover attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 176, 557 S.E.2d 708, 710 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997); American Fed. Bank, FSB v.

App. 1990)).\r\nâ€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature.â€Â  Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 75, 202 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1974); see also Seabrook Island Property Owners Assâ€™n v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œRestrictive covenants are contractual in nature and bind the parties thereto in the same manner as any other contract.â€) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s order analyzes Seabrookâ€™s contractual basis for recovery of attorneyâ€™s fees as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 2 of The Protective Covenants for the Seabrook Island Development, as amended (the â€œCovenantsâ€), binds all property owners in the Development to the obligations set forth in the Covenants and derivative regulations; Paragraph 2(e) addresses the adoption, distribution, and enforcement of the regulations for the common good, including regulations for the design and construction of improvements on and for the maintenance of property, as well as sanctions for violations.Â  Section 3 of the Covenants provides that the Board of Directors of the SIPOA has the right to bill for fees, charges, costs and assessments contemplated by the Covenants and/or imposed pursuant to the SIPOAâ€™s Bylaws, as amended from time to time, and to institute legal proceedings to collect such sums, â€œincluding the right to charge and collect all necessary attorneysâ€™ fees, court costs and other collection expenses.â€Â  Section 7.3 of the Bylaws of the SIPOA, as amended, provides for Plaintiff to recover its attorneysâ€™ fees and costs incurred in actions to collect amounts due and owing.Â  Section 8.5 of the Bylaws provides that in any action to enforce the covenants, the Bylaws or rules and regulations of the SIPOA, â€œthe Property Owner, tenant, guest, invitee or other person responsible for the violation of which abatement is sought shall pay all costs, including reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees actually incurred.â€\r\n\r\nWe are, accordingly, dealing with a contract-based attorneyâ€™s fee award.\r\nâ€œWhere there is a contract, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown.â€Â  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989) (citing Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 216 S.E.2d 541 (1975); Nelson v. Merritt, 281 S.C. 126, 314 S.E.2d 840 (Ct. App. 1984)); accord Blumberg, 310 S.C. at 493, 427 S.E.2d at 660.Â  â€œWhere an attorneyâ€™s services and their value are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€Â  Baron Data Sys., 297 S.C. at 384, 377 S.E.2d at 297 (citing Singleton v. Collins, 251 S.C. 208, 161 S.E.2d 246 (1968)).\r\nThere are six factors to consider in determining an award of attorneyâ€™s fees: 1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; 2) time and labor devoted to the case; 3) professional standing of counsel; 4) contingency of compensation; 5) fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services; and 6) beneficial results obtained. Blumberg, 310 S.C. at 494, 427 S.E.2d at 660 (citing Collins v. Collins, 239 S.C. 170, 122 S.E.2d 1 (1961)); Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997); Burton v. York County Sheriffâ€™s Dept., 358 S.C. 339, 358, 594 S.E.2d 888, 898 (Ct. App. 2004); Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 580, 532 S.E.2d 310, 314 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  On appeal an award of attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record supports each factor.Â  Blumberg, 310 S.C. at 494, 427 S.E.2d at 660.\r\nIn the case sub judice, the trial judge made detailed findings of fact and considered the six factors enumerated in Blumberg in concluding the attorneyâ€™s fees were reasonable and customary.Â  The judge noted the case took more than six years to resolve, included an appeal, and constituted 250 hours of attorney time.Â  The rates outlined in the itemized billing records reflected Wheelerâ€™s normal rates for similar litigation, were customary for the community, and showed Wheeler made numerous attempts to resolve the matter short of trial.Â  Additionally, Wheeler is a respected practitioner in the area of homeownersâ€™ association law and achieved a beneficial result in this case.Â Â  \r\nBergerâ€™s arguments that he spent less money than Seabrook on attorneyâ€™s fees and that the case was â€œnot complicatedâ€ enough to warrant the award do not persuade us that the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  Berger represented himself at various stages in the dispute.Â  The judge found the issues presented were â€œcomplexâ€ and cited Judge Youngâ€™s order noting the â€œlengthy litigation process.â€Â  Based upon the trial courtâ€™s written findings and our review of the record, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Bergerâ€™s argument the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was punitive in nature is without merit.Â  The only issue before the trial court was the assessment of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Seabrook.Â  There is no evidence the award was excessive or punitive in nature.Â  Seabrook presented ample evidence indicating it actually incurred the fees awarded.\r\nII.Â  No Right to Testify \r\nBerger argues the trial court erred by requiring that he submit an affidavit contesting the reasonableness of Seabrookâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, rather than allowing him to testify live at the hearing.Â  Berger further contends his live testimony would have better enabled him to address his objections to the attorneyâ€™s fees because Seabrookâ€™s attorney, Wheeler, was present and would have been able to clarify or respond to any matters in dispute.Â  \r\nAs a general rule, the admission of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of South Carolina, 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996);Â  Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 (1989);Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  On appeal, therefore, this Court will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s evidentiary rulings absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  at 439, 540 S.E.2d at 121; Elledge v. Richland/Lexington School Dist. Five, 352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2002); see also Whaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 483, 609 S.E.2d 286, 300 (2005) (observing admission of evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s decision will not be reversed on appeal unless it appears he clearly abused his discretion and the objecting party was prejudiced by the decision.Â  S.C. Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 548 S.E.2d 880 (Ct. App. 2001); Sullivan v. Davis, 317 S.C. 462, 454 S.E.2d 907 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œFor this Court to reverse a case based on the admission of evidence, both error and prejudice must be shown.â€Â  Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 448, 520 S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970)).Â  \r\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that this case does not involve the exclusion of any of Bergerâ€™s proffered evidence; rather it concerns the manner in which he was allowed to present the evidence.Â  Considering that the trial judge is vested with discretion to admit or exclude evidence, a fortiori the trial judge may regulate the manner in which evidence is offered to the court, subject to review for abuse of discretion or error of law.Â  Accordingly, we reason that in contesting a trial judgeâ€™s regulation of the way in which testimony is presented, an appellant must show both error and prejudice.Â  Cf. Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Center Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (citations omitted) (finding that to warrant a reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 525, 595 S.E.2d 817, 825 (Ct. App. 2004) (same); Rule 103, SCRE (providing that â€œ[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected[.]â€).\r\nUnlike in criminal cases, litigants in civil matters do not have a constitutionally guaranteed right to testify before the court.Â  In Faretta v. California, the United States Supreme Court observed that the Court has â€œoften recognized the constitutional stature of rights that, though not literally expressed in the document, are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process.â€Â  422 U.S. 806, 819, n.15 (1975).Â  Among these rights is the right of â€œan accused . . . to testify on his own behalf[.]â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  This guarantee pertains only to criminal cases, however.Â  â€œ[I]n the absence of due process concerns, there is no fundamental right to testify in a civil action.â€Â  Williams v. Chrysler Ins. Co., 928 P.2d 1375, 1381 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996). \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has addressed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees where a trial judge did not receive any evidence on the reasonableness of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Fargnoli, 274 S.C. 23, 260 S.E.2d 185 (1979), the court affirmed an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, even though the trial judge did not â€œreceiv[e] evidence as to the value of the services rendered.â€Â  Id. at 25-26, 260 S.E.2d at 187.Â  The Farmers court propounded:\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the amount of attorney fees to be awarded in a particular case is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  The law requires, however, that the award must be reasonable.Â  While there may be instances where the taking of evidence should be required in determining fees, we cannot say under the facts of this case that the amount awarded is unreasonable, or that it was error for the judge to award such an amount without evidentiary support.\r\n\r\nId. at 26, 260 S.E.2d at 187.Â  Subsequent decisions have emphasized the requirement that the record contain evidence supporting each of the six factors enumerated in Blumberg.Â  In Rowell v. Whisnant, 360 S.C. 181, 600 S.E.2d 96 (Ct. App. 2004), this Court explicated:\r\n\r\nTrial courts make specific findings of fact on the record for each of the factors set out above [the Blumberg factors].Â  In fact, â€œ[o]n appeal, absent sufficient evidentiary support on the record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  \r\n\r\nRowell, 360 S.C. at 186, 600 S.E.2d at 99 (quoting Blumberg, 310 S.C. at 494, 427 S.E.2d at 661).Â  \r\nThus, so long as the record supports each of the six factors for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to take any evidenceâ€”written or oralâ€”on the reasonableness of the fees is not necessarily erroneous.Â  In the instant case, the trial judge specifically addressed each of the Blumberg factors and concluded Seabrookâ€™s fees were reasonable.Â  Berger is unable to demonstrate to this Court that the trial judge erred, and we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s decision to consider Bergerâ€™s testimony through an affidavit rather than live testimony.\r\nEven were we to find error, Bergerâ€™s claim would still fail because he has not demonstrated prejudice resulting from the trial judgeâ€™s decision.Â  The judge did not exclude any evidence, and Berger cannot show he was prejudiced because his testimony was written rather than oral.Â  Although the trial judge did not permit Berger to testify in person, he allowed Berger to submit an affidavit up to twenty days after the hearing.Â  The affidavit provided Berger with a fair opportunity to offer complete, detailed testimony regarding his objections to the attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule that a trial judge in the exercise of discretion in an award of attorneyâ€™s fees under a contract between the parties is NOT required to take live testimony, provided the adverse party is allowed to present a full and complete presentation against the award of attorneyâ€™s fees by affidavits.Â  The record contains ample evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s findings and his award of $39,194.08 in attorneyâ€™s fees in favor of Seabrook.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial judge is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4013","title":"Miller v.

Johnson, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nMichael S. Thwaites, of Greer, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â This appeal arises from the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the employer in a case brought by employees pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act for unpaid overtime wages.Â  We affirm in result as to Ernest Miller.Â  We reverse and remand as to Patricia Miller.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBlumenthal Mills, Inc., is a textile manufacturer located in Marion, South Carolina.Â  Patricia Miller (Patricia) is employed by Blumenthal.Â  Ernest Miller (Ernest), Patriciaâ€™s husband, worked for Blumenthal before being terminated in May 2003 after a confrontation with a Blumenthal supervisor.Â  The Millers filed suit against Blumenthal alleging an unwritten plant rule required its workers to clock in approximately twenty minutes early every day to â€œperform . . . machine preparationâ€ or look over their work.Â  The Millers aver that during training, they were instructed to come in about twenty minutes before their shift started to check and make sure the prior shift left them in good shape.Â  The Millers were not paid for this extra time.Â  They contend the failure to pay overtime violates the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).[1]\r\nBlumenthal has a written policy contained in an employee handbook permitting its employees to clock in â€œa reasonable amount of time before the commencement of their shift.â€Â  Blumenthal asserts â€œ[t]his guideline is designed as a convenience to [employees] and to ease congestion at the time clock during starting and quitting times.â€Â  This policy prohibits employees from beginning any work-related activity before their regularly scheduled starting time, unless such activity is first approved in writing by management.\r\nIn order to provide a degree of exactitude in regard to the testimony of Patricia, we quote her deposition extensively:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  It has down here, â€œToday had a meeting with Tim Richardson . . . . Tim also said I was doing a good job coming in early and checking my cloth.Â  Julia was in there with me.â€Â  Where was this meeting?\r\nA.Â  In the supervisorâ€™s office.\r\nQ.Â  Who is Julia?\r\nA.Â  She is another weaver.Â  Julia Davis.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  When you went to work for Blumenthal, initially, was it as a weaver?\r\nA.Â  No, sir.Â  I was a creeler.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  Now, the creelers, are they required to be there twenty minutes ahead of time?\r\nA.Â  They have been told to get in there and check their job early to make sure everything was right.\r\nQ.Â  OK. . . . [W]ere you told to do that when you first went to work there?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  How long did it take you to do that?\r\nA.Â  At l[e]ast fifteen, twenty, twenty-five minutes.\r\nQ.Â  What would you have to do?\r\nA.Â  Go down the set I was creeling and check to see if all the filling was on the creel stand and make sure that I wasnâ€™t being left bad.\r\nQ.Â  You mean by the other shift when you say left bad?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  Why couldnâ€™t you do that when your shift started as opposed to twenty minutes before?\r\nA.Â  Because if I was left bad, there was nothing I could do about it.\r\nQ.Â  All right.Â  But, if you were left bad, what could you do about it then if you observed it before the shift?\r\nA.Â  I can have the other creeler took into the office and had said something about it to see if she couldnâ€™t tighten up in doing her job a little bit better.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  But . . . basically what you had to do is come in early to check on what the creelers were doing before you?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  How did you find out that you as a creeler were expected to be there early to check your work?\r\nA.Â  From the creeler that was training me.\r\nQ.Â  Who was that?\r\nA.Â  Sylvia.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  What exactly did Sylvia say to you?\r\nA.Â  She would say â€œCome in early. Check your job and make sure it is right.Â  If it is not, then you can take care of it.â€\r\nQ.Â  Would she tell you how early to come in?\r\nA.Â  She would say at least twenty minutes ahead of time.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  Did you [later] go through a specific training course [to become a weaver]?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  Who conducted that?\r\nA.Â  Ms. Diane.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  Tell me about your weaver training.Â  What did that involve?\r\nA.Â  . . . Ms. Diane would say â€œYou comeâ€”need to comeâ€”be on your job at least twenty minutes ahead of time.â€\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . [Y]our testimony is that Diane told the entire weave class they had to come in twenty minutes early?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  And, did she tell you why?\r\nA.Â  To make sure our jobs were running good.\r\nQ.Â  Did she tell you what that involved . . . making sure your jobs ran good?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  That was . . . to check your cloth.Â  Walk the back of your looms to make sure none of your lenos was running out.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . Check the cloth on your looms to make sure there were no defects?\r\nA.Â  No defects.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  Well, why would you need to come in early to do that?\r\nA.Â  To make sure it is running no defects.Â  If it is running defects, I can stop it off.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  So, you check cloth for defect.Â  What else would you do?\r\nA.Â  Check the back of the looms to make sure we had no lenos running out.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  So, you would go in early to check and make sure that you had ten [lenos on one side] and eight [lenos on the other side]?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  If not, we can stop off the loom and have that weaver to put them lenos in.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  Well, did you say that . . . you would go before your shift started and check this?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  And, did you then have the ability to stop the loom?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  So, you would stop the loom on somebody elseâ€™s shift?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  That is exactly what they told us we are allowed to do.\r\nQ.Â  Did you ever actually do that?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  And, would you then prior to your shift starting have to physically go to each of the fifteen looms and check for quality?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  How long would that take?\r\nA.Â  It usually takes no more than about twenty, twenty-five minutes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  How long would it take you to check [the lenos]?\r\nA.Â  It is probably no more than about a minute.\r\nQ.Â  Well, what if you found that there werenâ€™t enough lenos?Â  There was some problem with it.Â  Would you then have toâ€”\r\nA.Â  Stop the loom off and . . . put the right amount of lenos in.\r\nQ.Â  How often did that happen or does that happen?\r\nA.Â  It happens every day.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  And, you do this before your shift starts?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  How long does it take you in an average dayâ€”how many lenos do you have to swap out?\r\nA.Â  Anywhere from two to three.\r\nQ.Â  How long does it take you to do that?\r\nA.Â  It takes a good three minutes to run oneâ€”one leno in.\r\nQ.Â  So, that could take in an average day ten minutes?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  So, we have got checking cloth and making sure about the lenos.Â  Anything else that you have to do?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  We have to make sure it is running the right filling.\r\nQ.Â  How do you do that?\r\nA.Â  The weave order, we go and look to see what color the filling is that is supposed to be on the loom, then we take the weave order and match it up with the filling that is on the creel stand.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  And, then you look at the weave order and you do what with it?\r\nA.Â  Take it and go around to the filling to make sure it is running the right filling.\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  And, you do that for each of your fifteen looms?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  How long would that take total time?\r\nA.Â  No more than about two or three minutes [per loom].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . So, we are still talking about before your shift starts.Â  We have got checking cloth for defects.Â  Dealing with the lenos.Â  And, then I forgot what you called this last thing.Â  Matching up the orders to the filler?\r\nA.Â  Yes. To the filling.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . [W]hen you had a bunch of [lenos] you had to swap out, how long could that take to do?\r\nA.Â  Well, if you couldnâ€™t get them before work, then it would take all day to put them in. . . .\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . When you are matching up the orders to the filling and you find thereâ€™s mismatches, what would you have to do then?\r\nA.Â  Stop the loom off and take the wrong filling off and makeâ€”get the right filling and put it on there.\r\nQ.Â  Now, would you . . . also do that before your shift would start?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  So, you would stop another weaverâ€™s loom?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  Well, does that mean that you would . . . come to work, go out and do the prep work, and then go back to the time clock and clock in?\r\nA.Â  No, sir.Â  I would clock in, then I would go to work.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . And this coming in early has been the rule the whole time, is that right?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  I mean, were you aware you werenâ€™t getting paid for this time?\r\nA.Â  Yes, sir.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  But, even with these written guidelines in place, it is your testimony that the real rule is that you do have to come in twenty minutes ahead of time and do prep work?\r\nA.Â  Yes, because they tell us to.\r\nQ.Â  Who is they?\r\nA.Â  Trainees, our supervisor.Â  If we are having a problem with the weaver thatâ€”that is leaving us and they will say if we donâ€™t want our job running bad to come in and check it out a little bit early.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . I want you to give me theâ€”a list of the names of any witness, any person who can provide first hand testimony that is can say that they have seen you perform work-related activity before your shift started?\r\nA.Â  OK.Â  Julia Davis.\r\nQ.Â  Let me write them down as we are going along.Â  Julia Davis. Â She still works there?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  Jackie.Â  I donâ€™t know Jackieâ€™s last name.\r\nQ.Â  What does Jackie do?\r\nA.Â  Sheâ€™s a weaver.\r\nQ.Â  On what shift?\r\nA.Â  My shift.Â  Woody Church.Â  Was Roger Hilderbrand, but he ainâ€™t there no more.\r\nQ.Â  All right.Â  Woody Church is your immediate supervisor?\r\nA.Â  Yes.Â  And, he knows every morning when I clock in and when I go to my job, right along with Roger Hilderbrand, because I will be checking my cloth when Roger be doing his job and Roger will walk right by me.\r\nQ.Â  OK.\r\nA.Â  Tim Richardson, whenever Woody was out, he would come by and tap me on the shoulder and say, â€œGood job,â€ and keep right on getting it.Â Â  Deborah, James Wallace.\r\nQ.Â  All right.Â  Whatâ€™s Deborahâ€™s last name?\r\nA.Â  I do not know Deborahâ€™s last name.\r\nQ.Â  She work there still?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  Is she a weaver?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  On your shift?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  Iâ€™m sorry.Â  The next person.\r\nA.Â  James Wallace, Tim Martin.\r\nQ.Â  James Wallace is a weaver?\r\nA.Â  Well, heâ€™s a smash hand now.\r\nQ.Â  Right.Â  And Tim?\r\nA.Â  Martin.\r\nQ.Â  Who is he?\r\nA.Â  He is a pattern-change man.Â  He is theâ€”what is the next one in command?Â  I canâ€™tâ€”I canâ€™t remember what they call him.Â  But, he is next in command.Â  If Woody is out, he is supposed to take over Woodyâ€™s place.\r\nQ.Â  Was he like a lead man or something?\r\nA.Â  Something like that.\r\nQ.Â  OK.Â  Anybody else?\r\nA.Â  The creelers.Â  Tanya.Â  The doffers, which I do not know their names.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nQ.Â  . . . But, Julia Davis, again, who was she?\r\nA.Â  Sheâ€™s a weaver.\r\nQ.Â  And, she works the same shift you do?\r\nA.Â  The same shift I do.\r\nQ.Â  All right.Â  What is it exactly that she can testify about?Â  What could she say?\r\nA.Â  That I come in early and do my job.Â  Start my job.\r\nQ.Â  Is that what they can all say?Â  I meanâ€”\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\nQ.Â  So, Woody Church, your supervisor could say thatâ€”that he has seen you come in early and actually perform work-related activity twenty minutes before your shift started?\r\nA.Â  Yes.\r\n\r\nPatricia listed nine employees who saw her â€œpre-shiftâ€ work, including her two supervisors.Â  In his deposition, Woody Church, one of Patriciaâ€™s supervisors, declared he could not confirm or deny any pre-shift work because he would not have been in those work areas during the times around the shift changes.Â  According to Ernest, at a team meeting, a fellow employee complained: â€œWhy in the hell do we have to come in here early if we donâ€™t get paid for it?â€Â  Kenneth Gunnin, the mill president, told him: â€œIf you donâ€™t want your damn job, donâ€™t let the door hit you.â€\r\nBlumenthal moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 608 S.E.2d 587 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 611 S.E.2d 485 (2005); BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 608 S.E.2d 155 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 607 S.E.2d 63 (2004); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Gadson v. Hembree, Op. No. 25980 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 20 at 20); Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 605 S.E.2d 744 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Millers argue the trial court incorrectly held they must provide competent, corroborative evidence to support their allegations that they worked overtime and that management had either actual or constructive knowledge of the overtime hours worked.\r\nI.Â  Fair Labor Standards Act\r\nâ€œThe main federal law regulating wages and hours of employment is the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938].â€Â  48A Am. Jur. 2d Labor and Labor Relations Â§ 3808 (1994).Â  The purpose of the FLSA is to protect â€œthe rights of those who toil, of those who sacrifice a full measure of their freedom and talents to the use and profit of others.â€Â  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 597 (1944).Â  The FLSA was enacted in response to a congressional finding that some industries, engaged in commerce, maintained labor conditions which were detrimental to a minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and the general well-being of workers.Â  See 29 U.S.C. Â§ 202(a) (1998).Â  The Act attempts to eliminate unfair labor practices without substantially curtailing employment or earning power.Â  29 U.S.C. Â§ 202(b).Â  Because the FLSA is remedial and humanitarian in purpose, it should be broadly interpreted and applied to effectuate its goals.Â  Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R.R. Co., 321 U.S. at 597; Benshoff v. City of Virginia Beach, 180 F.3d 136 (4th Cir. 1999).\r\nThe FLSAâ€™s overtime provision, contained in Section 207(a)(1), reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his employees . . . for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\r\n\r\n29 U.S.C. Â§ 207(a)(1) (1998).Â  Section 216(b) of the FLSA gives employees a cause of action against employers who have violated Â§ 207(a)(1) and allows them to recoup the overtime wages plus liquidated damages, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs.Â  29 U.S.C. Â§ 216(b) (1998).\r\nIn order to recover for a violation of section 207(a)(1), an employee must prove (1) he worked overtime hours without compensation; (2) the amount and extent of the overtime work as a matter of just and reasonable inference; and (3) the employer had actual or constructive knowledge of the overtime work.Â  Davis v. Food Lion, Inc., 792 F.2d 1274 (4th Cir. 1986).Â  When employer knowledge is at issue, it has consistently been held that the employee has the initial burden of proving that the employer knew or should have known of the overtime work.Â  See Davis, 792 F.2d at 1276; see also Pforr v. Food Lion, Inc., 851 F.2d 106 (4th Cir. 1988) (noting the burden is on the plaintiff to establish knowledge, either actual or constructive, that the employer suffered or permitted the performance of uncompensated overtime work).Â  â€œThe case law uniformly supports this proposition.â€Â  Davis, 792 F.2d at 1276.\r\nThe circuit court based its decision to grant Blumenthalâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the following conclusion: â€œAt summary judgment, Plaintiffs may not rest on unsupported allegations that they worked overtime and that management knew it; rather, plaintiffs must provide competent, corroborative evidence to support each of these elements.â€Â  This fatal determination is premised singularly on two decisions: Darrikhuma v. Southland Corp., 975 F. Supp. 778, 783-84 (D. Md. 1997), affâ€™d, 129 F.3d 1258 (4th Cir. 1997) (unpublished), and Doran v. Sigman, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 6219 (W.D. Va. 1998).Â  Importantly, a careful search of FLSA case law demonstrates no court has required this increased burden of proof from the plaintiff.\r\nThe case of Lyle v. Food Lion, Inc., 954 F.2d 984 (4th Cir. 1992), is indicative of a standard FLSA claim.Â  The Lyle court inculcated: â€œTo prevail in the district court, [the employees] had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they worked overtime hours without compensation and that Food Lion knew of such work.â€Â  Id. at 987.Â  In Lyle, Food Lion appealed a decision holding it violated the FLSA on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to prove overtime hours were either worked or that Food Lion knew of the work.Â  Id.Â  The Fourth Circuit quoted and agreed with the district courtâ€™s finding:\r\n\r\nThis case hinges on a credibility determination.Â  The plaintiffs testified that they regularly worked off-the-clock with the knowledge of Food Lion officials at the store level.Â  These officials testified that they had no such knowledge and that it would have been impossible for the plaintiffs to have worked off-the-clock without their knowledge.Â  The court believes the plaintiffs and not the store managers.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Nowhere in the Lyle case does the court of appeals find that (1) employees cannot rest on unsupported allegations that they worked overtime and the management knew it and (2) employees must provide competent, corroborative evidence.\r\nAlthough the circuit court relied on Darrikhuma, that case is distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  Darrikhuma applies to a set of facts that are inapposite to the facts of the instant case.Â  Darrikhuma is dissimilar from this case and many other FLSA cases because Darrikhuma took steps to hide his off-the-clock work from his employer.Â  Darrikhumaâ€™s alleged unauthorized use of overtime was documented by his supervisor and he was informed that any unauthorized overtime would result in disciplinary action or termination.Â  Darrikhuma had previously requested overtime but was refused and told if he needed overtime he would be replaced.Â  975 F. Supp. at 783.Â  Darrikhuma then started working overtime hours in order to complete his duties but did not report them on his time sheet.Â  Id.Â  Darrikhumaâ€™s time sheet contained a statement from the employer warning employees not to work off-the-clock.Â  Id. at 780.\r\nDarrikhuma tried to impute constructive knowledge of his employment to his employer by stating a field consultant, who was not Darrikhumaâ€™s manager, knew about his working off-the-clock hours.Â  Id. at 783.Â  However, the field consultant thought Darrikhuma was a salaried employee and thus not subject to overtime restrictions.Â  After declaring this was not enough to justify the claim, the district court explicated: â€œAdditionally, Plaintiff offers no more than his own unsupported allegations that Defendant was actually advised of his working on the job and not being paid for those hours.Â  Thus, Plaintiff has failed to establish that Defendant had constructive or actual knowledge.â€Â  Id. at 784.Â  The district courtâ€™s order, which involved numerous other issues, was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in an unpublished decision that did not address any of the issues but simply affirmed the district courtâ€™s opinion.Â  See Darrikhuma v. Southland Corp., 129 F.3d 1258 (4th Cir. 1997).\r\nThe present case shares none of the factual similarities of Darrikhuma.Â  The Millers did not intentionally hide their off-the-clock hours. Â In fact, a review of their time sheets demonstrates the Millers clocked in early.Â  Unlike Darrikhuma, Patricia testified she had been trained and instructed by Blumenthal to engage in this pre-shift activity.Â  Patricia specifically named the trainers, supervisors, and other members of management who had directed her to perform this pre-shift work.Â  Patricia indicated there were a number of employees who heard the trainers, supervisors, and members of management when they instructed her in this regard.Â  Unlike Darrikhuma, who performed his overtime hours on the weekend when management was not on site, Patricia performed her work during working hours and during a time when management was present at the mill.Â  In contrast to Darrikhuma, who was threatened with termination if he worked the extra hours, Patricia testified that, when she was working uncompensated, pre-shift hours, one of her supervisors â€œwould come by and tap [her] on the shoulder and say, â€˜Good job,â€™ and keep right on getting it.â€\r\nThe Millersâ€™ case bears a striking resemblance to the Fourth Circuitâ€™s decision in Lyle.Â  In Lyle, the employer had a policy preventing off-the-clock work.Â  954 F.2d at 986.Â  Blumenthal had a putative policy preventing pre-shift work.Â  In Lyle, the employeesâ€™ case rested solely on their statement they worked overtime and management knew it.Â  Similarly, Patricia alleged she worked overtime and management knew it.Â  In addition, Patricia submitted an affidavit from John Schaeffer, a former co-worker, who stated in relevant part:\r\n\r\n2.Â  While I worked at Blumenthal Mills, Inc., I was told to come in about 20 to 30 minutes before my shift to begin work.\r\n3.Â  I regularly did this, and understood that it was a requirement.\r\n4.Â  Other employees also regularly came in before their shifts to work.\r\n5.Â  The work we did was the same kind of work that we performed while on our regular shifts.\r\n6.Â  Management of Blumenthal Mills, Inc. was aware that we were being told to come in and work before our shifts.Â  They enforced this as a rule.\r\n7.Â  We did not get paid for the time we worked before our shifts.\r\n\r\nLyle was not as strong as Patriciaâ€™s case because the managers in Lyle affirmatively testified that the employees did not work off-the clock.Â  Patriciaâ€™s manager testified he would not have known if Patricia came to work earlier than her shift.Â  Patricia explained her decision to keep quiet: â€œI seen [sic] a lot of people lose their job out there for no reason at all, because they complained about certain things out there.â€\r\nMoreover,Â  Darrikhuma is not the pronouncement of a new rule but is limited to the facts of that case.Â  In fact, under â€œSummary Judgment Standard,â€ the court articulates established summary judgment principles, NOT an increased burden for the plaintiff:\r\nII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\r\nSummary judgment will be granted when no genuine dispute of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The movant must demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute of material fact.Â  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-54, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).Â  While the Court views the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986), the mere existence of a â€œscintilla of evidenceâ€ is not enough to frustrate the motion.Â  To defeat it, the party opposing summary judgment must present evidence of specific facts from which the finder of fact could reasonably find for him.Â  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512; Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. at 2552-53.\r\n\r\nId. at 783.Â  The ruling in Darrikhuma does not allow a court to ignore a plaintiffâ€™s testimony as evidence in an FLSA case concerning overtime claims.\r\n Darrikhuma does not hold that a plaintiff must present more than his own testimony to support a claim for unpaid overtime under the FLSA.Â  Instead, the court explained that Darrikhuma failed to produce any evidence beyond his own speculation to prove that a third party who saw him working on weekends (1) knew that Darrikhuma was an hourly worker; (2) knew that, when she saw Darrikhuma working on weekends, he was working overtime hours, not part of his usual schedule; and (3) actually told Darrikhumaâ€™s management that she had seen Darrikhuma working on the weekends.Â  When presented with the question of whether he could prove the employerâ€™s management knew or should have known about his overtime work, Darrikhuma could only produce his speculation that the third party may have told management.Â  Both the third party and management denied this.Â  Unlike Darrikhuma, Patricia presented more than mere speculation about whether Blumenthal knew or should have known about the overtime hours for which she was not being compensated.\r\nAccording to the controlling case law, an employee in a section 207(a)(1) case must prove the employer knew or should have known about his overtime work and need only show facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn as to the amount of overtime he worked without compensation.Â  There is no heightened burden of proof beyond that in other civil cases.Â  An employee plaintiffâ€™s own testimony in a section 207(a)(1) case is evidence from which a reasonable juror could find the plaintiff worked the overtime hours he alleged and that management was aware of the uncompensated overtime hours worked.Â  There is no requirement that the employee do more than testify himself as to the elements.\r\nSignificantly, in Higgins v. Food Lion, Inc., 197 F. Supp. 2d 364 (D. Md. 2002), the district court cited Darrikhuma for the following principle: â€œAdditionally, a plaintiff must show that the employer had actual or constructive notice of the fact that the uncompensated person was working without compensation.â€Â  Id. at 368.Â  Higgins did NOT include a requirement that a plaintiff must present more than his own unsupported allegations that employer was actually advised of his working on the job and not being paid for those hours.\r\nII.Â  Portal-to-Portal Act\r\nIn 1947, Congress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act to clarify the duties of employers regarding the compensation of employees for activities that constitute work but which occur before, after, or during the work shift.Â  Gonzalez v. Farmington Foods, Inc., 296 F. Supp. 2d 912 (N.D. Ill. 2003).Â  The Portal-to-Portal Act provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(a)Â  Activities not compensable\r\n[N]o employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, . . . on account of the failure of such employer to pay an employee minimum wages, or to pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on account of any of the following activities of such employee . . .\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  \r\n(2) activities which are preliminary or postliminary to said principal activity or activities,\r\nwhich occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.\r\n  \r\n\r\n29 U.S.C. Â§ 254(a)(2) (1998).\r\nThe Portal-to-Portal Act established two categories of activities: (1) those which are principal and (2) those which are preliminary or postliminary.Â  Gonzalez, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 924.Â  Thus, even when an activity is properly classified as â€œwork,â€ the Portal-to-Portal Act exempts from compensation activities which are preliminary or postliminary to an employeeâ€™s principal activity or activities.Â  In Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S. 247 (1956), the United States Supreme Court established an exception to this rule:\r\n\r\n[A]ctivities performed either before or after the regular work shift, on or off the production line, are compensable under the portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those activities are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed and are not specifically excluded by Section 4(a)(1) [of the Portal-to-Portal Act].\r\n\r\nId. at 256; see also Davis v. Charoen Pokphand (USA), Inc., 302 F. Supp. 2d 1314 (M.D. Ala. 2004) (noting that activities are within coverage of FLSA, and outside exception in Portal-to-Portal Act, if those activities are integral and indispensable part of principal activities for which covered workmen are employed).Â  â€œAn activity is integral to a principal activity if the activity is made necessary by the nature of the work performed, it fulfills mutual obligations between the employer and his employees, the activity directly benefits the employer in the operation of his business, and the activity is closely related to other duties performed by the employees.â€Â \r\nHiner v. Penn-Harris-Madison Sch. Corp., 256 F. Supp. 2d 854, 859 (N.D. Ind. 2003).\r\nâ€œAs the Department of Labor stated in an interpretive bulletin, â€˜Congress intended the words principal activities to be construed liberally . . . to include any work of consequence performed for an employer, no matter when the work is performed.â€Â  Lindow v. United States, 738 F.2d 1057, 1061 (9th Cir. 1984) (quoting 29 C.F.R. Â§ 790.8(a)).Â  In order for a particular activity to be â€œintegral and indispensable,â€ it must be necessary to the principal activity performed and done for the benefit of the employer.Â  Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 750 F.2d 47 (8th Cir. 1984); Lee v. Am-Pro Protective Agency, Inc., 860 F. Supp. 325 (E.D. Va. 1994).\r\nActivities spent predominantly in the employeesâ€™ own interests are preliminary or postliminary.Â  Dunlop v. City Elec., Inc., 527 F.2d 394 (5th Cir. 1976); Truslow v. Spotsylvania County Sheriff, 783 F. Supp. 274 (E.D. Va. 1992).Â  However, an activity is not deemed â€œpreliminary or postliminaryâ€ and excluded from FLSA merely because it takes place before or after the work shift.Â  See Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 350 U.S. 260 (1956); Lee, 860 F. Supp. at 327.Â  In Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680 (1946), the Supreme Court discussed pre-shift duties and found the ones alleged were compensable.Â  The Court illuminated:\r\n\r\nThe employees proved, in addition, that they pursued certain preliminary activities after arriving at their places of work, such as putting on aprons and overalls, removing shirts, taping or greasing arms, putting on finger cots, preparing the equipment for productive work, turning on switches for lights and machinery, opening windows and assembling and sharpening tools. These activities are clearly work falling within the definition enunciated and applied in the Tennessee Coal and Jewell Ridge cases. They involve exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employerâ€™s benefit.Â  They are performed solely on the employerâ€™s premises and are a necessary prerequisite to productive work. There is nothing in such activities that partakes only of the personal convenience or needs of the employees. Hence they constitute work that must be accorded appropriate compensation under the statute.\r\n\r\nId. at 692-93.\r\nâ€œDecisions construing the Portal-to-Portal Act in conjunction with the FLSA make clear that the excepting language of section 4 was intended to exclude from FLSA coverage only those activities predominantly . . .spent in the employeesâ€™ own interests.â€Â  Dunlop, 527 F.2d at 398 (internal quotations omitted).Â  No benefit may inure to the company.Â  Id.Â  The Portal-to-Portal Act excluded from FLSA coverage activities undertaken for the employeesâ€™ own convenience, not required by the employer and not necessary for the performance of the employeeâ€™s duties.Â  Id.Â  The exemption was not intended to relieve employers from liability for any work of consequence performed for an employer from which the company derives significant benefit.Â  Id. at 398-99.Â  Necessity to the principal activity and benefit to the employer are the two critical tests.Â  Lee, 860 F. Supp. at 327.Â  The Lindow court noted it had not found any authority â€œwhich suggests that an employeeâ€™s labor is not integral and indispensable if it could have been performed during regular hours.Â  As long as the work is â€˜sufferedâ€™ or â€˜permittedâ€™ outside of normal hours, the work is compensable.â€Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1061.Â  The Portal-to-Portal Act exception is to be construed narrowly.Â  Dunlop, 527 F.2d at 398-99.\r\nBlumenthal allows an early clock-in in part to ease congestion at the time clock during shift changes.Â  This transition is made for the benefit of the mill so the mill can have seamless and continuous production.Â  Additionally, there is evidence of an unwritten rule requiring the workers to arrive early.Â  Patricia alleges she was trained to be at work approximately twenty minutes early.Â  Patriciaâ€™s testimony showed the purpose of her early arrival is to prevent defects and, if there is a problem or defect, she can stop the machine and correct it during her pre-shift time.Â  While a disciplinary policy was not in place to discipline employees that did not arrive early, an effective policy existed because the employees could be written up if they did not reach a pre-set quota of completed work at the conclusion of their shift.\r\nThe work Patricia asseverates she was required to perform prior to the beginning of her shift is not similar to the examples found in other Portal-to-Portal Act cases.Â  For instance, in Lindow v. United States, the district court found that prior to the start of their shifts the employees socialized and engaged in other non-work related activities.Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1059.Â  \r\nThere is evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could find that the work in which Patricia engaged, prior to the start of her shift, was actually the same work she did while on shift, rather than minor preparatory work.\r\nIII.Â  De Minimis Rule\r\nUnder the FLSA, employees cannot recover for otherwise compensable time if it is de minimis.Â  Lindow v. United States, 738 F.2d 1057 (9th Cir. 1984).Â  The de minimis rule is concerned with the practical administrative difficulty of recording small amounts of time for payroll purposes.Â  Id.Â  Employers, therefore, must compensate employees for even small amounts of daily time unless that time is so miniscule that it cannot, as an administrative matter, be recorded for payroll purposes.Â  Id.\r\nThe Supreme Court, in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 693 (1946), held that activities which involve â€œinsubstantial and insignificantâ€ periods of time are de minimis and should â€œnot be included in the statutory workweek.â€Â  The Anderson Court concluded:\r\n\r\nWhen the matter in issue concerns only a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours, such trifles may be disregarded.Â  Split-second absurdities are not justified by the actualities of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair Labor Standards Act.Â  It is only when an employee is required to give up a substantial measure of his time and effort that compensable working time is involved.\r\n\r\nId. at 692.\r\nOne factor in determining whether a claim is de minimis is the amount of daily time spent on the additional work.Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1062; see also Gonzalez v. Farmington Foods, Inc., 296 F. Supp. 2d 912, 928 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (â€œIn Lindow, the court set out four factors for determining whether an activity is de minimis as a matter of law.â€).Â  There is no precise amount of time that may be denied compensation as de minimis.Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1062.Â  No rigid rule can be applied with mathematical certainty.Â  Id.; Frank v. Wilson &amp; Co., 172 F.2d 712 (7th Cir. 1949).Â  Rather, common sense must be applied to the facts of each case.Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1062.\r\nMost courts have found daily periods of approximately ten minutes de minimis even though otherwise compensable.Â  See, e.g., E.I. du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Harrup, 227 F.2d 133 (4th Cir. 1955) (ten minutes); Green v. Planters Nut &amp; Chocolate Co., 177 F.2d 187, 188 (4th Cir. 1949) (â€œobviousâ€ that ten minutes is de minimis); Lindow v. United States, 738 F.2d 1057 (9th Cir. 1984) (seven to eight minutes); Carter v. Panama Canal Co., 314 F. Supp. 386 (D.D.C. 1970) (two to fifteen minutes), affâ€™d, 463 F.2d 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1972).Â  However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Ballaris v. Wacker Siltronic Corp., 370 F.3d 901&nbsp;(9th Cir. 2004), recently found twenty to thirty minutes was NOT de minimis.Â  Id. at 912; see also Kosakow v. New Rochelle Radiology Assocs., 274 F.3d 706&nbsp;(2d Cir. 2001) (fifteen minutes is not de minimis); Mireles v. Frio Foods, Inc., 899 F.2d 1407&nbsp;(5th Cir. 1990) (fifteen minutes not de minimis); Reich v. Monfort, Inc., 144 F.3d 1329, 1333 (10th Cir. 1998) (â€œ[W]e have cited with approval cases finding that â€˜as little as ten minutes of working time goes beyond the level of de minimis and triggers the FLSA.â€™â€); Metzler v. IBP, Inc., 127 F.3d 959 (10th Cir. 1997) (fourteen minutes is not de minimis).Â  Case law suggests it would be inappropriate to find that approximately twenty minutes of daily time spent on the additional work constitutes a de minimis amount of time.\r\nThe second factor that must be considered in determining whether otherwise compensable time is de minimis is â€œthe practical administrative difficulty of recording the additional time.â€Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1063.Â  â€œEmployers . . . must compensate employees for even small amounts of daily time unless that time is so minuscule that it cannot, as an administrative matter, be recorded for payroll purposes.â€Â  Id. at 1062-63.\r\nThe third factor that must be considered is the size of the aggregate claim.Â  Id. at 1063.Â  Courts have granted relief for claims that might have been minimal on a daily basis but, when aggregated, amounted to a substantial claim.Â  Id.Â  The fourth factor that must be considered in applying the de minimis rule is whether the employee performed the work on a regular basis.Â  Id.; see also 29 C.F.R. Â§ 785.47 (noting that employer should compensate â€œfixed or regularâ€ working time, however small).\r\nâ€œTo summarize, in determining whether otherwise compensable time is de minimis, we will consider (1) the practical administrative difficulty of recording the additional time; (2) the aggregate amount of compensable time; and (3) the regularity of the additional work.â€Â  Lindow, 738 F.2d at 1063.\r\nApplying the Lindow factors to the case at bar, jury issues are presented as to whether: (1) the time is easily recorded on the actual time cards of Patricia; (2) twenty minutes, factored in the aggregate, is a de minimis amount of time; and (3) the work is performed regularly and is not a sporadic requirement.Â  \r\nIV.Â  FLSA Designed to Protect Employees\r\nThe FLSA was designed to protect employees.Â  In Brooklyn Savings Bank v. Oâ€™Neil, 324 U.S. 697 (1945), the Supreme Court articulated:\r\n\r\nThe legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act shows an intent on the part of Congress to protect certain groups of the population from substandard wages and excessive hours which endangered the national health and well-being and the free flow of goods in interstate commerce.Â  The statute was a recognition of the fact that due to the unequal bargaining power as between employer and employee, certain segments of the population required federal compulsory legislation to prevent private contracts on their part which endangered national health and efficiency and as a result the free movement of goods in interstate commerce. To accomplish this purpose standards of minimum wages and maximum hours were provided.\r\n\r\nId. at 706-07 (footnotes omitted).Â  Doe v. United States, 372 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004), clarifies that employers cannot escape liability if they permit or suffer an employee to work overtime.Â  Id. at 1360-61; see also 29 C.F.R. 185.11 (noting that work not requested but suffered or permitted is work time).\r\nV.Â  Ernest Millerâ€™s Claim\r\nIn contrariety to the deposition of Patricia, the deposition of Ernest is imbued with generalities, lack of particularity, vagueness, and inexactitude in regard to any mandatory, specific pre-shift activities.Â  The conclusory and non-specific testimony of Ernest fails to survive the grant of summary judgment.Â  We agree with the circuit judge in his grant of summary judgment as to all claims of Ernest.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAmalgamating our analysis of the FLSA, the Portal-to-Portal Act, the de minimis rule, and policy aspects of the FLSA, we come to the ineluctable conclusion that the grant of summary judgment as to the claim of Patricia Miller is erroneous and is reversed.Â  We affirm the grant of summary judgment as to all claims of Ernest.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s order granting summary judgment as to Ernest Miller is AFFIRMED IN RESULT and REVERSED and REMANDED as to Patricia Miller.\r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT as to Ernest Miller; REVERSED and REMANDED as to Patricia Miller.\r\n STILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] 29 U.S.C.

A judgment was entered in the office of the Clerk of Court for Horry County in the sum of Fifteen Million and No/100 ($15,000,000.00) Dollars on August 3, 2001.

Collins argues: (1)\tSection 34-31-20(B), as amended, left intact the legal rate of Fourteen (14%) Percent interest on the Collinsâ€™ judgment; and (2)\tAll issues are moot because IGT a/k/a IGT-North America paid the sum of Twenty Million Six Hundred Three Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty One and 08/100 ($20,603,831.08) Dollars in satisfaction of judgment in Nevada. IGT a/k/a IGT-North America contends the interest issue was reserved in Nevada.","date":"2005-07-18","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCollins Music Co., Inc., Respondent,\r\nv.\r\nIGT a/k/a IGT- North America, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4015\r\nHeard June 16, 2005 â€“ Filed July 18, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\nAppeal From Horry County\r\nÂ John L.Â  Breeden, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nR.

Mongillo, of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: The Horry County Clerk of Court issued a Transcript of Judgment, and subsequently an Amended Transcript of Judgment, in furtherance of Collins Music Co., Inc.â€™s (Collins) right to enforce in Nevada a judgment obtained against IGT.Â  IGT appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order denying its Rule 60(a), SCRCP motion to vacate the Amended Transcript of Judgment on the ground it improperly provides for post-judgment interest at the rate of fourteen percent (14%).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCollins originally brought suit in 1994 against IGT asserting multiple causes of action arising from a contractual dispute.Â  A jury returned a verdict of $15,000,000 in actual damages in favor of Collins.Â  This Court dismissed IGTâ€™s appeal as untimely.Â  See Collins Music Co., Inc. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 579 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nCollins sought to enforce the judgment in Nevada pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, Nev. Rev. Stat. Â§ 17.330-17.400.Â  On January 14, 2002, the Horry County Clerk of Court issued a Transcript of Judgment.Â  It provided for interest accruing at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year.Â  Thereafter, upon request by Collins, the Clerk of Court issued an Amended Transcript of Judgment.Â  The amended transcript provided:\r\n\r\nInterest accrues on South Carolina judgments (from causes of action arising prior [sic] January 1, 2001) at the rate of 14% per annum.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (2002 Cum. Supp.)Â  This cause of action was filed in 1994 so the 14% interest rate applies. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis in original.)\r\nCollins filed the Amended Transcript of Judgment with the Nevada court on August 14, 2003, along with a supporting affidavit from Collinsâ€™ counsel.Â  A copy of the amended transcript was sent to IGTâ€™s Nevada counsel.\r\nIn September 2003, IGT filed and served its Rule 60(a), SCRCP motion seeking an order withdrawing and vacating the Amended Transcript of Judgment. Â The court denied the motion on February 20, 2004, and IGT appealed on March 18, 2004.\r\nOn March 24, 2004, IGT filed its motion for Leave to Deposit Money with Court in the Nevada action.Â  IGT deposited the money with the Nevada court on April 2, 2004, and the Nevada court issued an Order for Disbursement of Funds in Satisfaction of Judgment on April 5.Â  IGT did not appeal this order, and the funds were subsequently paid to Collins.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIGT contends the trial court erred in failing to vacate and withdraw the Amended Transcript of Judgment.Â  IGT asserts section 34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code, as amended by 2000 Act No. 344, does not allow for the collection of interest where a cause of action arose prior to January 2001, but final judgment was not rendered until after January 2001.Â  In the alternative, IGT maintains the appropriate statutory interest is twelve percent (12%) and not fourteen percent (14%).Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Mootness\r\nFirst, Collins contends the issue is moot and not available for review on appeal because IGT made the payment to the Nevada court prior to this appeal.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA matter becomes moot â€œwhen judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567-68, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001) (alteration in original) (quoting Mathis v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973)), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 926 (2002).Â  In civil cases, there are three exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) an appellate court can retain jurisdiction if the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review, (2) an appellate court can decide cases of urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest, and (3) if the decision by the trial court can affect future events or have collateral consequences to the parties, the appellate court can take jurisdiction.Â  Curtis at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596.\r\nIn the instant case, the third exception to the mootness doctrine is applicable.Â  If IGT failed to make payment, the amount of interest charged against IGT would continue to increase.Â  It would be nonsensical to require IGT to incur an ever-increasing amount of post-judgment interest in order to bring an appeal.Â  As a result, we find this Court retains jurisdiction to hear this case and to decide the issue regarding post-judgment interest.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Statutory Construction\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003); Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 739 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it reasonably can be discovered in the language used, and the language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck (VIN # jm2uf1132n0294812), 330 S.C. 371, 375, 498 S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â Â  \r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  â€œOur goal in construing statutes is to prevent an interpretation that would lead to a result that is plainly absurd.â€Â  In re Timothy C.M., 348 S.C. 653, 655-56, 560 S.E.2d 452, 453 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Florence County v. Moore, 344 S.C. 596, 601, 545 S.E.2d 507, 509 (2001)); Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Lic., &amp; Reg., 337 S.C. 476, 492, 523 S.E.2d 795, 803 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe legislature has sought to ensure amended statutes are not read in a way that leads to an absurd result.Â  Section 2-7-50 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\nWhenever, in any act, reference is made to this Code for the purpose of altering, amending, adding to or repealing any part thereof, such reference, alteration, amendment, addition or repeal shall be construed to apply to the original law purporting to be revised in such revision as fully and specifically as though such original laws were mentioned in the act containing such reference, alteration, amendment, addition or repeal.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-7-50 (1976).\r\nA brief but relevant look at the history of the right to interest on judgments is edifying for the instant case.Â  \r\n\r\nAccording to the common law the execution could only issue for the precise sum adjudged to be due to the plaintiff, however long the enforcement of it might be postponed, although in a new action he might recover the interest. The act of 1815 was intended to remedy this evil; it provides, â€œthat in all judgments and decrees of the courts of law and equity hereafter to be obtained and rendered on any judgment, bond, bill or promissory note, or other cause of action bearing interest, the principal sum of the judgment, bondâ€ &amp;c. â€œshall continue to bear the same interest as the original cause of action did bear before the entry of judgment thereon,â€ and that execution should issue\r\ntherefor.\r\n\r\nRichardson v. Richardson, 16 S.C.Eq. (McMul.Eq.) 103 (1841); see also Sears v. Fowler, 293 S.C. 43, 45, 358 S.E.2d 574, 575 (1987) (noting that at common law, judgments did not bear interest) (citing Annot., 15 A.L.R.3d 411, 414 (1967)).Â  Interest is generally allowable pursuant to statutory enactments.Â  Sears, 293 S.C. at 45, 358 S.E.2d at 575.\r\nSection 34-31-20(B)â€™s predecessor provided: â€œall money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or entered . . . shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of six percent per annum.â€Â  S.C. Code Â§ 8-2 (1962).Â  The six percent (6%) rate was carried over into the 1976 Code, and in 1979, the rate was changed to eight and three-fourths percent (8.75%).Â  See 1979 Act No. 159.Â  Effective June 9, 1982, the rate was increased to fourteen percent (14%).Â  1982 Act No. 445; see also Southeastern Freight Lines v. Michelin Tire Corp., 279 S.C. 174, 175, 303 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1983).Â  The 1982 Act included a statement regarding the effective date: â€œThis act shall take effect upon approval by the Governor.â€Â  1982 Act No. 445, Â§ 2.\r\nIn Southeastern Freight Lines, the South Carolina Supreme Court considered the impact of the 1982 Act on a judgment entered before the effective date, but not satisfied until after the date of the changed interest rate.Â  Southeastern Freight Lines v. Michelin Tire Corp., 279 S.C. 174, 175, 303 S.E.2d 860, 861 (1983).Â  Finding the change in interest rate applied to all judgments, even those entered before the effective date but not yet satisfied, the court determined interest would be charged at eight and three-fourths percent (8.75%) before June 9 and fourteen percent (14%) after June 9, 1982.Â  Id. at 175-76, 303 S.E.2d at 861-62.\r\nAt issue in the instant case are the changes to the interest rate made effective by 2000 Act No. 344.Â  Section 34-31-20(B), prior to January 2001, provided: â€œAll money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or entered shall draw interest according to law.Â  The legal interest shall be at the rate of fourteen percent per annum.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (Supp. 1999).Â  Between January 1, 2001 and March 21, 2005, section 34-31-20(B) read: â€œAll money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or entered shall draw interest according to law.Â  The legal interest is at the rate of twelve percent a year.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (Supp. 2004).Â  Indubitably, the only change to the law was the certain rate allowed for interest.\r\nThe 2000 Act provided the following effective date:Â  â€œThis act takes effect January 1, 2001, and applies with respect to interest calculated pursuant to causes of action arising or accruing on or after that date.â€Â  2000 Act No. 344, Â§ 4.Â  The question before this Court is whether this provision requires a finding that a litigant in a case in which the cause of action arose before the effective date of January 1, 2001, but where judgment was not rendered until after that date, must forfeit the right to post-judgment interest.Â  \r\nReading section 2-7-50 in conjunction with the 2000 Act and section 34-31-20, it is apodictic that the legislature intended there to be continuity in the charge of interest to judgments.Â  Nothing in the 2000 Act indicates the legislature sought to create an aperture in coverage, thus eliminating from entitlement to interest litigants in cases accruing before January 1, 2001 but pending final judgment until after January 1, 2001.Â  For this Court to construe the effective date section of the 2000 Act as eliminating interest based solely on what date a final judgment is rendered would constitute an absurd result.Â  \r\nCollinsâ€™ cause of action arose prior to January 1, 2001.Â  Under the clear, unambiguous wording of the 2000 Actâ€™s effective date section, the new interest rate does not apply.Â  The version of section 34-31-20(B) that existed prior to the 2000 Act remained in effect and was not repealed by the passage of the 2000 amendment.Â  We refuse to arbitrarily deny interest to Collins because of the date its judgment was entered.Â  Concomitantly, Collins is entitled to receive interest of its judgment against IGT.\r\nIn the instant case, unlike the Southeastern Freight Lines case, the 2000 Act included a statement denoting which judgments were affected by the new interest rate.Â  The effective date provision clearly indicates it applies only to causes of action arising or accruing on or after January 1, 2001.Â  Thus, the fourteen percent (14%) rate under the pre-2000 Act statute applies to Collinsâ€™ judgment, and the amount does not change as a result of the 2000 Act.\r\nFinally, we note that in the 2005 session, the legislature again amended section 34-31-20(B).Â  However, the 2005 amendment has no bearing on the disposition of this case.Â  Section 34-31-20(B) now reads:\r\n\r\nA money decree or judgment of a court enrolled or entered must draw interest according to law.Â  The legal rate of interest is equal to the prime rate as listed in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal published for each calendar year for which the damages are awarded, plus four percentage points, compounded annually.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court shall issue an order by January 15 of each year confirming the annual prime rate.Â  This section applies to all judgments entered on or after July 1, 2005.Â  For judgments entered between July 1, 2005, and January 14, 2006, the legal rate shall be the first prime rate as published in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal after January 1, 2005, plus four percentage points.\r\n\r\n2005 Act No. 27.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule the fourteen percent (14%) rate applies to all causes of action arising between June 9, 1982 and December 31, 2000, whether or not a final judgment was entered prior to January 1, 2001.Â  The order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4016","title":"University of Southern California v.

Â Robert Moran, an attorney, was appointed as the personal representative of both estates and the successor trustee of the Anderson Trust.Â  After his appointment, Moran flew to Minnesota for the Andersonsâ€™ memorial service.Â  While in Minnesota, Moran informed the Andersonsâ€™ nieces and nephews, including Louis Chubiz and Michael Chubiz, that they would receive $10,000 distributions from the Anderson Trust.Â  \r\nThe Chubizes threatened to contest Mrs. Andersonâ€™s will and the Anderson Trust on the ground that the documents were the product of undue influence.Â  Based on this threat, Moran and the Chubizes negotiated a compromise agreement in which Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate agreed to pay both of the Chubizes $175,000.Â  Moran signed the agreement in his capacity as trustee of the Anderson Trust, but refused to sign it as personal representative of Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate unless the probate court approved the agreement.Â  The Chubizes filed a petition in the probate court seeking approval of the compromise agreement pursuant to sections 62-3-1101 and -1102 of the South Carolina Code (1987 &amp; Supp. 2004).Â  The University received notice of the proposed compromise agreement and filed a motion opposing it.Â Â  \r\nThe probate court heard the Universityâ€™s motion and issued an order finding the requirements of section 62-3-1102 had been met.Â  The probate court ruled: (1) the agreement was the result of a good-faith controversy; and (2) Moran as trustee, not the University, was the holder of the beneficial interest affected by the compromise agreement.Â Â Â  \r\nThe University appealed the probate courtâ€™s order to the circuit court, arguing the probate court erred in finding both a good-faith controversy existed and the University was not a holder of a beneficial interest.Â  The University maintained its signature was required for judicial approval of the compromise agreement.Â  Following a hearing, the circuit court issued an order affirming the probate court.Â  The University appeals only the issue of whether it was a holder of a beneficial interest.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAppeal from the probate court is governed by the provisions of the Probate Code.â€Â \r\nIn re Howard,\r\n315 S.C. 356, 360, 434 S.E.2d 254, 256 (1993).Â  The Probate Code requires appeals from the probate court be to the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308 (Supp. 2004).Â  The Probate Code further instructs the circuit court to â€œhear and determine the appeal according to the rules of law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(d) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œAs used in this statute, the phrase â€˜according to the rules of lawâ€™ means according to the rules governing appeals.â€Â  In re Howard, 315 S.C. at 360, 434 S.E.2d at 257.Â  â€œ[I]f there is neither a statute nor a rule of court expressly prescribing a different standard of review, the circuit court must apply the same standard that [the appellate court] would apply were the appeal taken directly to either [the supreme court or court of appeals].â€Â  Id. at 361, 434 S.E.2d at 257. \r\nThe standard of review applicable to cases originating in the probate court depends upon whether the underlying cause of action is at law or in equity.Â  In re Estate of Hyman, 362 S.C. 20, 25, 606 S.E.2d 205, 207 (Ct. App. 2004); In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 568, 544 S.E.2d 854, 856 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An issue regarding statutory interpretation is a question of law.Â \r\nWimberly v. Barr, 359 S.C. 414, 597 S.E.2d 853 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Thus, â€œthe circuit court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence to support them.â€Â  In re Howard, 315 S.C. at 361, 434 S.E.2d at 257; see also In re Estate of Pallister, 363 S.C. 437, ___, 611 S.E.2d 250, 256 (2005) (â€œIf the proceeding in the probate court is in the nature of an action at law, the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence to support them.â€).Â  The standard of review at law is the same whether the facts are found by a jury or the judge sitting without a jury.Â  In re Howard, 315 S.C. at 361, 434 S.E.2d at 257.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe University argues the probate court and the circuit court erred in finding the compromise agreement entered into by Moran, as trustee, and the Chubizes met the requirements of sections 62-3-1101 and -1102 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Specifically, the University contends it held a beneficial interest in Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate.Â  Therefore, the University asserts its signature was necessary to meet the requirements set forth in section 62-3-1102 for court approval of a compromise of a controversy regarding a decedentâ€™s estate.Â  We disagree. \r\nI.Â  Rules of Statutory Construction\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature.Â  Bass v. Isochem, Op. No. 3996 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 6, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 24 at 42); Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 579 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Gordon v. Phillips Utils., Inc., 362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005) (â€œThe primary purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 567 S.E.2d 240 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998).\r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  Bass v. Isochem, Op.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct.

Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996) (stating that in ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as a whole).\r\nII.Â  Sections 62-3-1101 and 62-3-1102\r\nSection 62-3-1101 of the South Carolina Code, addressing court approval of agreements involving estates, provides: \r\n\r\nA compromise of a controversy as to admission to probate of an instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity, or effect of a probated will, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, of a successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties including those unborn, unascertained, or who could not be located.Â  An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest.Â  A compromise does not impair the rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.Â  A compromise approved pursuant to this section is not a settlement of a claim subject to the provisions of Section 62-5-433.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1101 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  Section 62-3-1102 of the South Carolina Code states: \r\n\r\nThe procedure for securing court approval of a compromise is as follows:\r\n  \r\n(1) The terms of the compromise shall be set forth in an agreement in writing which shall be executed by all competent persons and parents acting for any minor child having beneficial interests or having claims which will or may be affected by the compromise.Â  Execution is not required by any person whose identity cannot be ascertained or whose whereabouts is unknown and cannot reasonably be ascertained.\r\n(2) Any interested person, including the personal representative or a trustee, then may submit the agreement to the court for its approval and for execution by the personal representative, the trustee of every affected testamentary trust, and other fiduciaries and representatives.\r\n(3) After notice to all interested persons or their representatives, including the personal representative of the estate and all affected trustees of trusts, the court, if it finds that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other representatives is just and reasonable, shall make an order approving the agreement and directing all fiduciaries subject to its jurisdiction to execute the agreement. Minor children represented only by their parents may be bound only if their parents join with other competent persons in execution of the compromise.Â  Upon the making of the order and the execution of the agreement, all further disposition of the estate is in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1102 (1987) (emphasis added).Â  The Reporterâ€™s Comments to this section provide: â€œThe agreement must be signed by all persons having a beneficial interest in or claim against the estate, whose interest or claim is affected by the agreement.Â  If an interested party is a minor, the agreement may be executed on his behalf by his parent.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1102 Reporterâ€™s Comments (1987) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nSection 62-3-1102 allows competent persons having beneficial interests to enter into a written, court-approved settlement.Â  The settlement, or compromise, is valid and binding where the court finds (1) the controversy is in good faith, and (2) the agreementâ€™s effect is just and reasonable.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-1102(3) (1987).Â  The issue in the instant case does not pertain to these two statutory requirements, but rather to the prerequisite mandate that the written agreement be executed by all competent persons having a beneficial interest.Â  \r\nThe term â€œbeneficial interestâ€ is not defined in the Probate Code.Â  Section 62-1-201(2) defines â€œbeneficiaryâ€ as follows:Â  â€œâ€˜Beneficiaryâ€™, as it relates to trust beneficiaries, includes a person who has any present or future interest, vested or contingent, and also includes the owner of an interest by assignment or other transfer and, as it relates to a charitable trust, includes any person entitled to enforce the trust.â€Â  This definition, as indicated, only defines the term to the extent it relates to trust beneficiaries and does not address â€œbeneficiariesâ€ of a decedentâ€™s estate.Â  \r\nIn the context of section 62-3-1102, â€œcompetent persons . . . having beneficial interestsâ€ refers to a beneficial interest in the decedentâ€™s estate.Â  Therefore, the central question here is not who holds the beneficial interest in the Anderson Trust, but who has the beneficial interest in Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate.Â  \r\nSeveral provisions of the Probate Code support the Chubizesâ€™ reading of section 62-3-1102 that the trust holds the beneficial interest in Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate.Â  Section 62-1-201(8) defines â€œdeviseeâ€ as â€œany person designated in a will to receive a devise.Â  In the case of a devise to an existing trust or trustee, or to a trustee on trust described by will, the trust or trustee is the devisee and the beneficiaries are not devisees.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(8) (1987) (emphasis added).Â  Section 62-1-403 provides that, absent a conflict of interest, â€œorders binding a trustee bind beneficiaries of the trust in proceedings to probate a will establishing or adding to a trust to review the acts or accounts of a prior fiduciary and in proceedings involving creditors or other third parties[.]â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-403(2)(ii) (1987).Â  \r\nThat the trust is an entity and not an individual is of no concern as the Probate Code defines â€œpersonâ€ as â€œan individual, a corporation, an organization or other legal entity.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(29) (1987).Â  Moran signed the compromise agreement in his capacity as trustee of the Anderson Trust.Â  \r\nPolicy considerations weigh in favor of ruling the trust is the person having the beneficial interest in Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate.Â  â€œ[F]amily settlements are favored by the courts[.]â€Â  Dibble v. Dibble, 248 S.C. 165, 171, 149 S.E.2d 355, 358 (1966).Â  Our reading of section 62-3-1102 allows the trustee to resolve a dispute and thereby avoid a will contest that would significantly alter the deceasedâ€™s stated intent.Â  Under the Universityâ€™s interpretation of section 62-3-1102, one of many trust beneficiaries could exercise veto power over an attempted compromise under section 62-3-1102.Â  By failing to consent as a signatory of a settlement, trust beneficiaries would encourage litigation rather than settlement.Â  The better approach is to vest the trustee, who has a fiduciary obligation to administer the trust in the best interests of the trust beneficiaries, with the power to enter into the compromise on behalf of the trust.Â  \r\nIndeed, both the Anderson Trust and the Probate Code give the trustee the power to enter into settlements.Â  The trust agreement enumerates various powers of the trustee.Â  Included in these powers is: (1) the power to â€œabandon, compromise, arbitrate or otherwise deal with and settle claims in favor of or against our estate and any trust created hereunder as may be deemed advisable by our trusteeâ€ and (2) the discretionary power to â€œdo all such acts and exercise all such rights and privileges, although not specifically listed hereunder, which our trustee deems necessary or advisable for the proper and advantageous management, investment and distribution of the trust created hereunder, and to make, sign and deliver any instruments or agreements binding this trust.â€Â  \r\nIn addition to the powers specified in the trust agreement, the agreement provides the trustee â€œshall have all the powers provided in the statutes.â€Â  Section 62-7-704(c)(19) of the South Carolina Probate Code (Supp. 2004), imparts powers to a trustee, including the power â€œto pay or contest any claim; to settle a claim by or against the trust by compromise, arbitration, or otherwise[.]â€Â  Thus, the trust agreement and the statutory authority give Moran the power to compromise a claim on behalf of the trust.Â  \r\nFinally, the University, as a beneficiary under the trust, does have the ability to influence the courtâ€™s decision whether to approve the compromise agreement.Â  Section 62-1-201(20) of the Probate Code provides the following definition for â€œinterested person:â€Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œInterested personâ€ includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent, ward, or protected person which may be affected by the proceeding.Â  It also includes persons having priority for appointment as personal representative and other fiduciaries representing interested persons.Â  The meaning as it relates to particular persons may vary from time to time and must be determined according to the particular purposes of, and matter involved in, any proceeding.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201(20) (1987).\r\nUnder this statute, we find the University is an interested person.Â  Section 62-3-1102(3) of the Probate Code states interested persons are entitled to receive notification prior to a courtâ€™s decision to approve a compromise agreement.Â  The University did in fact receive such notice in this case.Â  Upon receipt of notification, the University objected to the compromise agreement and was given an opportunity to voice its objection to the probate court prior to the courtâ€™s decision on whether or not to approve the compromise agreement.Â  Section 62-3-1102 of the South Carolina Probate Code, however, does not require interested persons execute the compromise agreement in order for a court to approve the agreement.Â  Thus, the University, as an interested party, is entitled to receive notice of a proposed compromise, but its signature is not required for court approval of the agreement.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the Anderson Trust is the beneficiary of Mrs. Andersonâ€™s estate, and Moran, as trustee, is the person required to execute the compromise agreement.Â  Because only the trust, as holder of the beneficial interest, must sign the compromise agreement, the circuit court did not err in concluding the requirements of section 62-3-1102 were met.Â  Section 62-3-1102(3) mandates that an interested person receive notice of a proposed compromise, and allows the interested person to participate in the proceedings, including objecting to any compromise agreement.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4017","title":"Primerica Life Insurance Company v.

Sheffield, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Primerica Insurance Company, Inc. filed this action against Ray K. Ingram, Sr. seeking rescission of a life insurance policy and policy rider.Â  Ingram counterclaimed for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay insurance proceeds.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Primerica.Â  Ingram appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRay Ingram and his wife, Rachel, applied for and procured life insurance on each of their lives:Â  a policy on Ingramâ€™s life in the amount of $223,000, and a policy rider on Rachelâ€™s life providing for a $104,000 death benefit.Â  At the time of the application, Rachel had been diagnosed with and was being treated for cardiomyopathy.Â  Less than two months after the policy and rider were issued, Rachel died from cardiac arrhythmia associated with cardiomyopathy.Â  Ingram made a claim under the policy rider for the death benefit.Â  Primerica denied Ingramâ€™s claim based on the failure to disclose Rachelâ€™s diagnosis and treatment for a heart condition.Â  \r\nIngram and Rachel met with two agents of Primerica Life Insurance Company to complete the application.Â  One of the agents filled out the application while questioning the Ingrams.Â  The application included the following instruction: \r\n\r\nThe following questions must be answered for Primary, and if applicable, Spouse and Child(ren): \r\nIn the past 10 years have you been treated for or had any indication of: \r\n2A.Â  Chest pain, angina, heart murmur, heart attack, stroke, or other disorder of the heart or blood vessels? \r\n\r\nTo the right of the question, the application provided â€œyesâ€ and â€œnoâ€ boxes for the applicant to check under two different columnsâ€”one labeled â€œPrimaryâ€ and the other labeled â€œSpouse and/or Child.â€Â  On the application, the â€œyesâ€ box was checked under both the â€œPrimaryâ€ column and the â€œSpouse and/or Childâ€ column.Â  \r\nThe application also requested â€œDetails of Medical Questions 1 through 7.â€Â  Under the details section, the application indicated Ingram suffered from chest pain and had been treated at Tuomey Hospital.Â  In addition, the application indicated Aaron, the Ingramsâ€™ son, was born with a heart murmur.Â  There were no details provided regarding Rachel. \r\n\r\nAnother section of the application contained the following questions: \r\n  \r\nIn the past 3 years other than as answered above, have you:Â  \r\nHad any checkup or examination or been a patient in a hospital, clinic or other medial facility? \r\nHad any electrocardiogram, x-ray or diagnostic test?Â  \r\nBeen advised to have any diagnostic test, hospitalization or surgery which has not yet been done?Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAgain, to the right of each question, the application contained â€œyesâ€ and â€œnoâ€ boxes under the headings of Primary and Spouse and/or Child.Â  All three boxes under Primary were checked yes and all three boxes under Spouse and/or Child were checked no.Â  The application also provided a space below for â€œDetails of Medical Questions 8 through 10.â€Â  Information regarding various procedures performed on Ingramâ€™s heart was provided.Â  No information on Rachel was provided.\r\nIngram does not dispute the existence of his wifeâ€™s heart condition at the time the couple executed the application.Â  Nor does he dispute the absence of this information in the application.Â  Additionally, Ingram admits that if this information had been disclosed, it would have been material to the risk to the insurer.Â  However, Ingram argues he and Rachel disclosed this information to Primericaâ€™s agents, and the agents failed to include it in the application.Â  Thus, he contends he did not intend to defraud Primerica.Â  \r\n\r\nIngram testified in his deposition: \r\n  \r\nI brought up the heart condition, the micro, whatever the situation is.Â  I still canâ€™t pronounce it.Â  But I think she told them about, also, she had, in the past, [been] diagnosed with a lump in her breast.\r\n* * *\r\nWe went so far dealing with the heart micro prolapse, or whatever the name of the thing is, until she got up to went to try - - she went and got her medicine bottle, the pills that she was taking. \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Ingram testified his wife told the agents about her dizziness, the blurring in her eyes, and the heaviness she felt in her chest.Â  Ingram stated his wife also told the agents about her recent doctorsâ€™ appointments and her doctorâ€™s name.Â  Furthermore, Ingram and Rachel signed authorizations to obtain medical records.Â  \r\nThe agent who took the information from the Ingrams testified in his deposition that Rachel did not inform him of her heart condition or related symptoms or treatment.Â  However, he recalled Rachel bringing a pill bottle or prescription bottle into the room.Â  \r\nIngram reviewed the application after the agents filled it in.Â  In his testimony regarding whether he actually read the application prior to signing it, Ingram stated he did not read the application word-for-word.Â  Rather, he â€œlooked at the â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™ answers and kind of like just glanced across everything else and then we signed it.â€Â  In regard to information about his wife on the application, Ingram testified: \r\n\r\nThat particular part, I reviewed and when I reviewed, I reviewed the question and when I saw the â€˜yesâ€™ checked where it asked the question on 2A, I think it was, about the chest pains and whatever and the heart murmur and whatnot, when I looked under for spouse and/or children[,] when it [sic] saw it checked â€˜yesâ€™ I didnâ€™t observe the documentation that [the agent] wrote down on that.Â  I was comfortable when I saw the â€˜yesâ€™ checked and that at that moment that we disclosed everything we needed to. \r\n\r\nPrimerica brought this action against Ingram seeking to have the policy and rider rescinded.Â  Ingram answered and counterclaimed, alleging breach of contract and bad faith by Primerica.Â  Primerica filed a motion for summary judgment on Ingramâ€™s bad faith claim and on its rescission claim.Â  The trial court, in two separate orders, granted both of Primericaâ€™s motions.Â  Ingram appeals the trial courtâ€™s order awarding summary judgment on the rescission claim. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â \r\nWhite v. J.M.

Shafer, a security guard for Saber Security Services, Inc., shot Christopher Longshore causing serious injuries.Â  Longshore brought actions for negligent use of deadly force, negligent hiring, training, and supervision, and assault and battery.Â  The jury returned an inconsistent or incomplete verdict on the negligent use of deadly force claim, a verdict for Saber and Shafer on the assault and battery action, and a substantial verdict for both actual and punitive damages against Saber on the negligent hiring, training, and supervision cause of action.Â  Saber and Longshore appeal.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Incident\r\nIn December 1996, Longshore attended a party at the National Guard Armory in Laurens County.Â  Saber provided two security guards for this event, one of whom was Shafer.Â  As the party was winding down, Shafer and the other security guard were directing traffic when a fight broke out.Â  A crowd gathered around the scene, and someone pulled out a pistol and fired three shots into the air.Â  After briefly taking cover, the security guards began working their way through the crowd checking on the safety of those leaving the party.Â  The security guards stopped two people and searched for weapons, but found none.Â  They then observed a vehicle containing three or four individuals, two of whom were fighting.Â  They saw an individual, later identified as Derrick Bluford, fire four shots into the crowd wounding two people.Â  \r\nShafer testified he ran up to the car and ordered the shooter to drop his weapon and get on the ground.Â  After initially balking, the shooter eventually complied.Â  Shafer disarmed him and handed the weapon to the other security guard.Â  \r\nAt about that time, Longshore, who is Blufordâ€™s brother, stopped his car about 50 feet away and began walking toward Shafer and Bluford.[1]Â  Shafer testified he saw a passenger in Longshoreâ€™s vehicle pointing a nickel-plated automatic weapon at him over the top of the car.Â  Shafer advanced toward Longshore and ordered Longshore to put his hands in the air.Â  Longshore and several eyewitnesses testified that Longshore put both hands in the air, but Shafer testified that Longshore kept one hand behind his back.Â  Shafer further testified that Longshore kept advancing toward him after he told Longshore to stop or he would shoot.Â  Shafer then shot Longshore in the stomach.Â  \r\nLater that evening, police officers found a chrome-plated automatic weapon in Longshoreâ€™s car.Â  Another witness, Clifford Cook, testified the weapon was registered to him and that he had put the gun in the glove compartment of Longshoreâ€™s car.Â  \r\nShaferâ€™s Hiring and Training\r\nSaber hired Shafer approximately two weeks before the shooting incident occurred.Â  Shafer applied, was recommended by another employee, and was hired the following day.Â  Saber did not check Shaferâ€™s employment references, age, or high school diploma, as required by company policy.Â  \r\nBecause Shafer was already licensed through the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) as an armed security guard, Saber did not train Shafer for the position.Â  Saber took Shaferâ€™s fingerprints and discussed the companyâ€™s weapons policy with him.Â  Shafer, however, failed to complete the weapons policy form in violation of company policy.Â  \r\nShafer was also required to have SLED transfer his license from his former employer to Saber.Â  It is undisputed that Shafer had not yet received his transferred license on the date the shooting occurred.Â  Pursuant to state law at that time, security guards could work but could not carry a weapon until receipt of a license.Â  \r\nThe Verdicts\r\nThe first cause of action, negligence, was submitted to the jury on the direct negligence of Shafer and vicarious negligence of Saber, on the theory that Shafer was Saberâ€™s agent.Â  The jury found both defendants negligent and that their negligence proximately caused Longshoreâ€™s injuries.Â  The jury additionally found, however, that Longshore was also negligent and that his negligence proximately caused his injuries.Â  Fault was allocated 50% to the defendants and 50% to Longshore.Â  The jury then awarded zero damages.Â  \r\nIn the second cause of action, negligent hiring, training, and supervision, the caption of both the complaint and the verdict form referred only to Saber, omitting any reference to Shafer.Â  However, the allegations of the complaint realleged and incorporated all of the preceding allegations relating to negligence on the part of both Shafer and Saber.Â  Also, the first question on the verdict form required the jury to find if â€œthe defendants were negligent and [whether] such negligence proximately caused the plaintiffâ€™s injuries.â€Â  That question was answered in the affirmative, but the jury found no comparative negligence on the part of Longshore as to this cause of action.Â  The jury awarded Longshore $800,000 in actual damages and $200,000 in punitive damages on this cause of action.Â  \r\nThe third cause of action, assault and battery, was submitted to the jury against both Saber and Shafer, and resulted in a defense verdict.Â  \r\nPost Verdict Events\r\nSaber moved for JNOV on the second cause of action, negligent hiring, training, and supervision, based on lack of proximate cause.Â  In the alternative, Saber argued the verdict in the negligent hiring, training, and supervision action should be reduced because the jury concluded Longshore was 50% negligent in the negligence cause of action.Â  Saber further moved for a new trial absolute or for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Finally, Saber requested that the court dismiss the punitive damages award, or, in the alternative, review the punitive damages for excessiveness under Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991).Â  Longshore moved for JNOV and for a new trial absolute and/or additur as to the negligence cause of action.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court denied all motions except Saberâ€™s motion to amend the judgment.Â  Finding that Longshoreâ€™s 50% negligence applied to all negligence causes of action, the trial court reduced the actual damages to $400,000.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action in tort for damages is an action at law.Â  Culler v. Blue Ridge Elec. Coop., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 246, 422 S.E.2d 91, 93 (1992).Â  In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, appellate courts are free to decide novel questions of law with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320, 14-3-330, &amp; 14-8-200 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004); see also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (2000).Â  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    Saber and Longshore appeal.[2]Â  Saber argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in both causes of action for negligence.Â  Saber also argues the trial court erred in failing to reduce or set aside the award of punitive damages.Â  Longshore argues the trial court erred in reducing the actual damages awarded in the negligent hiring, training, and supervision action by his comparative negligence found by the jury in the negligence action. \r\n    I.Â  Denial of Saberâ€™s JNOV Motion\r\n    Saber argues the trial court should have granted its JNOV motion because the jury found Longshore negligent in the first cause of action and returned a defense verdict on the assault and battery claim.Â  Saber argues the combination of these two findings precludes a finding that Saber proximately caused Longshoreâ€™s injuries.Â  Underlying Saberâ€™s argument is its contention that the jury determined Shaferâ€™s act of shooting Longshore was justified and such a determination, of necessity, absolves Saber of any liability based on the theory of negligent hiring, training, or supervision.Â  We find no error by the trial court in denying Saberâ€™s JNOV motion.Â  \r\n    When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, the evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 229, 584 S.E.2d 423, 429 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The appellate court will reverse the trial court only where there is no evidence to support the ruling.Â  Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004).\r\n    Neither current statutory law nor jurisprudence in this state has specifically required a plaintiff, in an action against an employer for negligent hiring, training, and supervision, to prove the employee committed an actionable tort.Â  However, there is authority to support the proposition.Â  See Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 431-33, 567 S.E.2d 231, 238-39 (2002) (Pleicones, J., dissenting).Â  In this case, we are not required to address the issue because, as previously noted, the action for negligent hiring, training, and supervision against Saber also included allegations of negligence by Shafer, and the verdict form required the jury to determine whether the â€œdefendantsâ€ were negligent.Â  \r\n    Furthermore, the juryâ€™s verdict for the defendants on the claim for assault and battery can be harmonized with the verdicts in the negligence and negligent hiring, training, and supervision actions.Â  Assault and battery is generally classified as an intentional tort, as contrasted with a tort based on negligence.Â  See generally State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Barrett, 340 S.C. 1, 10, 530 S.E.2d 132, 137 (Ct. App. 2000); F. Patrick Hubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 389-97 (2d ed. 1997).Â  We find no inconsistency in these verdicts.Â  The juryâ€™s findings, as a whole, indicate the jury concluded the shooting was the result of negligence.Â  \r\n    For instance, although the jury found Longshore 50% at fault in the negligence cause of action, the jury could reasonably have concluded that, as to negligent hiring, training, or supervision, Saberâ€™s negligence was the sole proximate cause of Longshoreâ€™s injuries.Â  Longshore had nothing to do with Shaferâ€™s hiring, training, or supervision.Â  These responsibilities were within the exclusive domain of Saber.Â  â€œIt is enough if the negligent act complained of is at least one of the causes without which the injury would not have occurred.â€Â  Shepard v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrs., 299 S.C. 370, 375, 385 S.E.2d 35, 37 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  On this cause of action, the jury absolved Longshore of any comparative negligence.\r\n    We cannot agree with Saberâ€™s argument that the only inference to be drawn from the jury verdicts taken as a whole is that Saberâ€™s actions could not have been the proximate cause of Longshoreâ€™s injuries.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in denying Saberâ€™s motion for JNOV.Â  \r\n    II.Â  Reduction of Damagesâ€”Longshoreâ€™s Comparative Negligence\r\n    Longshore argues the trial court erred in applying the juryâ€™s finding of his own 50% comparative negligence, found by the jury in the negligence action, to the damages awarded in the negligent hiring, training, and supervision action.Â  Longshore also argues the consequent 50% reduction of actual damages in the negligent hiring, training, and supervision action constitutes error.Â  We agree. \r\n    The trial court cited no authority or precedent for its determination that a juryâ€™s finding of comparative negligence in one cause of action should apply to another cause of action, and we have found no South Carolina cases directly on point.Â  Complicating the analysis is the admittedly inconsistent or incomplete verdict in the first cause of action.Â  When the jury assesses liability to a defendant but awards zero damages, the verdict is facially inconsistent and contrary to South Carolina law.Â  Stevens v. Allen, 342 S.C. 47, 53, 536 S.E.2d 663, 666 (2000).Â  â€œ[T]he proper and most consistent approach of treating such verdicts is to require, upon request, the trial court to re-submit the matter to the jury.Â  If the jury cannot reach a consistent verdict, the trial court may then order a new trial nisi or a new trial absolute.â€Â  Id.Â  However, the law imposes no duty upon the trial judge to reject an inconsistent verdict in the absence of an objection by either party.Â  Id. at 50, 536 S.E.2d at 664. \r\n    Neither party moved the trial court to resubmit the matter to the jury, and the trial court had no authority or duty to do so in the absence of such a motion.Â  Neither the parties to the litigation nor the court should be required to guess what the jury sought to accomplish.Â  Daves, 355 S.C. at 231, 284 S.E.2d at 430.Â  However, it is the duty of the court to sustain verdicts when a logical reason for reconciling them can be found.Â  Id. (holding where two verdicts are inconsistent, the court may not speculate as to which verdict was valid and which was not).Â  \r\n    We find at least one logical way to reconcile the verdicts.Â  As previously discussed, although the jury found Longshore 50% at fault in the negligence cause of action, the jury could reasonably have concluded that, as between Longshore and Shafer during the shooting incident, both parties were at fault.Â  The jury could also have concluded that as between Longshore and Saber, regarding negligent hiring, training, or supervision, Saberâ€™s negligence was the sole proximate cause of Longshoreâ€™s injuries.Â  Thus, we hold the trial court erred in reducing the amount of actual damages returned in the negligent hiring, training, and supervision verdict.Â  The negligence of both Saber and Shafer was submitted to the jury in both causes of action, and both were determined to have been liable to Longshore in each cause of action.Â  However, the two causes of action are separate and distinct requiring different kinds and quantities of proof.Â  Longshore was not found to be comparatively negligent in the cause of action in which the jury returned a verdict.Â  Because the verdict on the first cause of action, negligence, is essentially a nullity, we perceive no difficulty in ascertaining at least one rationale for the juryâ€™s verdicts and affirming its award of actual damages in the negligent hiring, training, and supervision cause of action.Â  We therefore find the trial court erred in reducing the verdict by 50%.Â  \r\n    III.Â  Punitive Damages\r\n    Saber lastly argues the punitive damages award should be reversed.Â  We agree. \r\n    Punitive damages are quasi-criminal in nature and are imposed to punish a wrongdoer and to deter like conduct.Â  Atkinson v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 361 S.C. 156, 164, 604 S.E.2d 385, 389 (2004).Â  Although appellate review of an award of punitive damages is limited to the correction of errors of law, an award of punitive damages must be proven under a significant burden of proof:Â  clear and convincing evidence.Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 310, 594 S.E.2d 867, 873 (Ct. App. 2004); Hundley v. Rite Aid of South Carolina, Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 311, 529 S.E.2d 45, 59 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n    Furthermore, the plaintiff must prove the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of his rights.Â  Id.Â  â€œ[T]rial judges in this state have long been required, as a threshold matter, to assess the culpability of a defendantâ€™s conduct to determine whether punitive damages are available in a given case (i.e., whether the issue should be submitted to the jury).â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love Chevrolet, Inc., 324 S.C. 149, 152, 478 S.E.2d 57, 58&nbsp;(1996).[3]\r\n    Upon review, we find no clear and convincing evidence that Saberâ€™s conduct in negligently hiring, training, or supervising Shafer was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the rights of others.Â  The evidence at most establishes that Saber was negligent.Â  Saber did fail to comply with some of its internal policies.Â  However, it hired Shafer based on a favorable reference.Â  Because Shafer was already licensed, Saber was not required to re-train him, but Saber did ensure that Shafer read its weapons policy.Â  Saber committed an administrative violation by allowing Shafer to work as an armed security guard before his license transfer had been processed by SLED.Â  However, this had no bearing on Shaferâ€™s training in the use of a firearm.Â  There is no evidence that the purpose of the license transfer regulation was to prevent incidents such as the one in this case.Â  The trial court specifically found that there was no evidence that either party knew it was impermissible for Shafer to work as an armed guard before his license transfer was accomplished.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence that Saberâ€™s negligence was anything other than a one time occurrence.Â  \r\n    We therefore find that the trial court erred in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury.Â  Longshore has failed as a matter of law to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that Saberâ€™s negligence in hiring, training, and supervising Shafer was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of his rights. \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    We affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Saberâ€™s motion for JNOV due to the inconsistency of the verdicts.Â  We reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision to reduce the award of actual damages.Â  We likewise reverse the award of punitive damages.Â  \r\n     AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n    GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Longshoreâ€™s testimony on this point conflicted with Shaferâ€™s, who testified he ordered Longshore out of the car.\r\n[2] Respondent Shafer did not file a brief.\r\n[3] Once the trial judge determines a punitive damage award is warranted under the facts of a case, the amount to be assessed has historically been measured by the jury against the character of the wrong committed, the punishment to be applied, and the ability of the defendant to pay.Â  Id. at 152, 478 S.E.2d at 58.Â  See also Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-12, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991) (enumerating factors to consider when reviewing amount of punitive damages awarded).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
