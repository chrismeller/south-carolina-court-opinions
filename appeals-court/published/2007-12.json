Edward Welmaker, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4320\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2007 â€“ Filed\r\n  December 4, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDeputy\r\n  Chief Attorney for Capital Appeals Robert M. Dudek, of the South Carolina\r\n  Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney\r\n  General Norman Mark Rapoport, of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of\r\n  Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J.:Â  Appellant, Donald Wayne Paige,\r\n  was indicted for murder and subsequently convicted of involuntary manslaughter.[1]Â \r\n  He appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in failing to require spectators at\r\n  his trial to remove photograph buttons of the deceased from their clothing.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[2]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis\r\n  case arose from a tragic confrontation involving three men, resulting in the\r\n  shotgun death of one of them.Â  The evidence presented at trial shows that\r\n  around 9:00 in the morning on April 23, 2004, Donald Paige and his friend and\r\n  employer, Ray Davis, arrived at the camper home of the victim, Jason Henderson,\r\n  and his fiancÃ©e, Andrea Pruitt.Â  Paige and Davis knocked on the door, and Henderson answered it.Â  Paige held a sawed-off shotgun.Â  A conversation ensued and heated\r\n  words were exchanged between Henderson and Paige.Â  Although there is some\r\n  dispute as to whether Paige pointed the gun at Henderson and whether Henderson\r\n  grabbed the gun, causing it to discharge, it is undisputed that the gun went\r\n  off, hitting Henderson in his abdomen, resulting in his death.Â  It is also\r\n  undisputed that Paige entered Hendersonâ€™s property accompanied by Davis for the purpose of confronting Henderson about a\r\n  financial dispute between Henderson and Davis, he did so armed with a sawed-off\r\n  shotgun, and when he knocked on Hendersonâ€™s door he had the shotgun loaded and\r\n  cocked with his finger on the trigger.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe only issue raised on appeal is whether the trial court\r\n  erred in denying appellantâ€™s motion to have spectators in the courtroom remove\r\n  from their clothing photograph buttons of the victim.Â  Appellant contends there\r\n  was evidence the decedent was â€œgoing after appellant when the gun accidentallyâ€\r\n  discharged, and that, by wearing the buttons, the spectators were attempting to\r\n  create sympathy â€œfor what otherwise did not appear to be a very sympathetic\r\n  situation,â€ to the prejudice of appellant.Â  Appellant maintains he is thus\r\n  entitled to a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  record reveals that prior to jury selection in Paigeâ€™s trial, defense counsel\r\n  indicated she had a matter to bring to the courtâ€™s attention.Â  Counsel noted\r\n  that there were â€œseveral persons sitting on this side behind the State with\r\n  pictures taped to their clothing.â€Â  She inquired whether they were pictures of\r\n  the deceased and asked, if they were, that the spectators remove them.Â  The\r\n  solicitor responded that they were pictures of the deceased, that his family\r\n  members had the buttons created after his death, and that none of the Stateâ€™s\r\n  witnesses would be wearing them.Â  The court questioned whether any of these\r\n  individuals would be testifying, and the solicitor indicated they would not.Â \r\n  The following colloquy then occurred:\r\n\r\n\t[Court]:Â They\r\n  will be sitting in the back of the courtroom?Â  None of them will be at the\r\n  counsel table?\r\n\t[Solicitor]: None\r\n  will be at the table, Your Honor.Â  We will be happy to put them in whatever row\r\n  the court deems appropriate, but certainly they are - - itâ€™s a public courtroom\r\n  and a photograph of the deceased canâ€™t be prejudicial.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel objected,\r\n  stating the purpose of the photo was to invoke jury sympathy for the Stateâ€™s\r\n  case, and because they were sitting behind the State in the courtroom, it was\r\n  prejudicial to the defendant. Â The court ruled it would not require the individuals\r\n  to remove the buttons, but would make sure that they did not sit on the front\r\n  row of seats.Â  He further instructed the solicitor that she was to instruct\r\n  these spectators there were to be no gestures of any kind made by them, or they\r\n  would be removed from the courtroom.Â  The court stated if they pointed to the\r\n  picture or did anything to try to influence the jury, it would not be\r\n  tolerated.Â  The solicitor insured the court these individuals would be\r\n  instructed accordingly.Â  Thereafter, the jury was drawn and the trial\r\n  proceeded, with no further mention of the buttons.\r\nWhether\r\n  a defendantâ€™s fair trial rights may be violated when spectators wear photo\r\n  buttons of the victim at his or her trial is a matter of first impression in\r\n  this jurisdiction.Â  The United States Supreme Court has recently indicated that\r\n  the effect of spectators wearing such buttons on a defendantâ€™s fair trial\r\n  rights was an open question.Â  Carey v. Musladin, ___U.S. ___, ___, 127\r\n  S. Ct. 649, 653 (2006).Â  In Carey, the state court, citing Holbrook\r\n    v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560 (1986), found Musladin had to show actual or\r\n  inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim, and concluded the buttons â€œhad not\r\n  branded defendant with an unmistakable mark of guilt in the eyes of the\r\n  jurors.â€Â  Id. at 652.Â  At the conclusion of the state appellate process,\r\n  Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal district\r\n  court, which the District Court denied.Â  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\r\n  Circuit reversed, finding the state courtâ€™s decision was contrary to, or\r\n  involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.Â  Id.Â  In particular, the Court of Appeals relied on the Supreme Courtâ€™s decisions in Estelle\r\n    v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501 (1976) and Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560\r\n  (1986). Â Id.Â  The Supreme Court vacated, finding there was a lack of\r\n  holdings from the court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of\r\n  spectator courtroom conduct and, thus, the state court did not unreasonably\r\n  apply clearly established federal law.[3]Â  Id. at 654.Â  In doing so, the Supreme Court observed that both Williams,\r\n  wherein the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison garb, and Flynn,\r\n  wherein the State seated four uniformed troopers immediately behind the\r\n  defendant at trial, involved government-sponsored courtroom practices, as\r\n  opposed to the spectator conduct complained of by Musladin.Â  Id. Â at\r\n  653.Â  While the court had articulated the test for inherent prejudice that\r\n  applies to state conduct in Williams and Flynn, the court\r\n  concluded it had never applied that test to spectatorsâ€™ conduct.Â  The court\r\n  then pointed out, â€œIndeed, part of the legal test of Williams and Flynn â€“ asking whether the practices furthered an essential state interest â€“\r\n  suggests that those cases apply only to state sponsored practices.â€ Â Id. at 653-54.\r\nTurning\r\n  to our own established law, we note the general rule in this State is that the\r\n  conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court, and the appellate court will not interfere unless it clearly\r\n  appears that the rights of the complaining party were abused or prejudiced in\r\n  some way.Â  State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212\r\n  (1982).Â Â  As to courtroom conduct, our courts have held that a defendant in a\r\n  criminal prosecution is constitutionally guaranteed a fair trial by an\r\n  impartial jury, and in order to fully safeguard this protection, it is required\r\n  that the jury render its verdict free from outside influence.Â  State v.\r\n    Carrigan, 284 S.C. 610, 613-14, 328 S.E.2d 119, 121 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  In State\r\n      v. Stewart, 278 S.C. 296, 295 S.E.2d 627 (1982), cert. denied, 459\r\n  U.S. 828 (1982), our supreme court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  right to a fair trial by an impartial jury in a criminal prosecution is\r\n  guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and by Article I, Â§\r\n  14, of the S.C. Constitution.Â  While this right does not require a â€œperfectâ€\r\n  trial, the very heart of a â€œfair trialâ€ embodies a disciplined courtroom\r\n  wherein an accusedâ€™s fate is determined solely through the exercise of calm and\r\n  informed judgment.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIdeal\r\n  conditions, it is true, are not to be expected, and verdicts should not be set\r\n  aside by an appellate court for misconduct in a trial, unless the evidence is\r\n  clear and convincing that extraneous influences so interfered with the conduct\r\n  of the trial, or so pressed upon the jury, as to become factors in the result.Â  \r\n\t\tState v. Weldon, 91 S.C. 29, 74 S.E. 43 (1912).\r\n\t\r\n\tIt is\r\n  the duty of the trial judge to see that the integrity of his court is not\r\n  obstructed by any person or persons whatsoever.Â  Shearer v. DeShon, 240\r\n  S.C. 472, 126 S.E.2d 514 (1962); 75 Am.Jur.2d Trial Â§ 40 (1974).Â  His exercise\r\n  of this duty will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nId. at 303-04, 295 S.E.2d at 630-31.\r\nWhile\r\n  research reveals our state courts have not addressed the issue of spectator\r\n  courtroom conduct of wearing buttons displaying photos of the victim, our\r\n  supreme court has addressed the issue of the government-sponsored courtroom\r\n  practice of having uniformed officers present in the courtroom. Â In State v.\r\n    Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 501 S.E.2d 122 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1043 (1998), Hill asserted the presence of the officers â€œwas a show of force which\r\n  denied him a fair trial.â€Â  Id. at 100-01, 501 S.E.2d at 125-26.Â  Citing Holbrook\r\n    v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560 (1986), the court held that in order to prevail on\r\n  such a claim, Hill was required to show that measures taken in the courtroom\r\n  created either an actual or inherent prejudicial effect on the jury.Â  Id. at 101, 501 S.E.2d at 126.Â  â€œInherent prejudice occurs when â€˜an unacceptable\r\n  risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.â€™â€Â  Id. citing Flynn. Â Noting the court could not determine from the record how\r\n  many uniformed officers were present, nor whether they were present to provide\r\n  security or to testify, it found any actual prejudice in the case was wholly\r\n  speculative, and Hill failed to present any evidence to show the presence of\r\n  the officers had any effect on the jury.Â  The court further determined that\r\n  without anything more than Hillâ€™s mere assertion that six officers were present\r\n  in the courtroom, the court could not find Hill had shown any inherent\r\n  prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, assuming arguendo that our state courts would apply the\r\n  â€œactual or inherent prejudicial effect on the juryâ€ test to this spectator, as\r\n  opposed to state-sponsored conduct, we conclude Paige has failed to show any\r\n  actual or inherent prejudice under the circumstances of this case.Â  The record\r\n  shows the only mention of the buttons was prior to jury selection, and out of\r\n  the presence of the jury venire, at which time defense counsel had to inquire\r\n  whether the buttons did in fact depict a picture of the victim.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence of the size of the buttons, or the number of spectators who wore the\r\n  buttons.Â  While the trial court stated he would not require the individuals to\r\n  remove the buttons, he insured that these spectators would not be called as\r\n  witnesses, nor would they be seated in the front row.Â  He further instructed\r\n  that these individuals would not be allowed to make gestures, point to the\r\n  pictures, or do anything in an attempt to influence the jury.Â  Because no other\r\n  mention was made of the buttons, this court cannot even determine that these\r\n  spectators remained in the courtroom for the remainder of the trial or, if they\r\n  did, whether they continued to wear the buttons.Â  Simply put, there is\r\n  absolutely no evidence of record that the jurors in this matter were ever\r\n  exposed to these button photos, and, if they were, whether they could perceive\r\n  that they depicted the victim.Â  Accordingly, we find no actual or inherent\r\n  prejudice to Paige based on the record before us.Â  Additionally, the evidence\r\n  is not clear and convincing of extraneous influences that â€œso interfered with\r\n  the conduct of the trial, or so pressed upon the jury,â€ as to become factors in\r\n  the result of Paigeâ€™s trial.Â  State v. Stewart, 278 S.C. at 303, 295\r\n  S.E.2d at 631 (quoting State v. Weldon, 91 S.C. 29, 74 S.E. 43 (1912)).Â  \r\n \r\nBased on the foregoing, Paigeâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Paige was also indicted for and convicted of\r\n  possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  However, the\r\n  trial judge, with the Stateâ€™s consent, vacated the weapons charge based on a\r\n  determination that involuntary manslaughter did not qualify as a crime of\r\n  violence.\r\n[2]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n[3]The Supreme Court pointed out that the lack of\r\n  guidance from its own court was reflected in the lower courtsâ€™ widely divergent\r\n  treatment of defendantsâ€™ spectator-conduct claims, ranging from applying Williams and Flynn to spectator claims, to distinguishing Flynn on the\r\n  facts, to ruling on the issue without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing Williams or Flynn.Â  Musladin, 127 S.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n\t\t\t\tSenior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of\r\n  the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jerry\r\n  Gerald Serrette appeals from his convictions for trafficking cocaine and\r\n  possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  Serrette contends this court\r\n  should remand for a reconstruction hearing because the record of his original\r\n  trial was lost during the nearly eleven-year gap between conviction and\r\n  sentencing due to his fugitive status.Â  We dismiss.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 12, 1994, Serrette was convicted in absentia for trafficking cocaine and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  A\r\n  bench warrant was issued, and over ten years later, Serrette was arrested and\r\n  sentenced to six yearsâ€™ imprisonment for the cocaine charge and a concurrent\r\n  four yearsâ€™ imprisonment on the marijuana charge.Â  After filing a notice of\r\n  appeal, Serrette learned his trial transcript had been destroyed pursuant to\r\n  Rule 607(i), SCACR, which allows court reporters to reuse or destroy tapes of a\r\n  proceeding after five years.Â  On appeal, Serrette asks this court to remand for\r\n  a reconstruction hearing.Â  The State opposes a remand and contends the case\r\n  should be dismissed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSerrette\r\n  argues he is entitled to a direct appeal, which cannot be meaningfully\r\n  perfected without a trial transcript.Â  He asks that we remand his case to have\r\n  the record reconstructed and allow the circuit court to determine whether\r\n  reconstruction is possible. The State counters that dismissing the appeal is an\r\n  appropriate sanction because Serretteâ€™s willful decision to remain a fugitive\r\n  from justice for nearly eleven years has â€œpresent[ed] an obstacle to orderly\r\n  appellate reviewâ€ as discussed in Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507\r\n  U.S. 234, 251 (1993).Â  We agree with the Stateâ€™s position.\r\nThough South Carolina affords criminal defendants the\r\n  opportunity to appeal, the right to an appeal may be lost through a variety of\r\n  actions by an appellant, such as: (1) failure to timely serve a notice of\r\n  appeal under Rule 203, SCACR; (2) failure to serve and file an initial brief and\r\n  designation of matter under Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR; or (3) failure to serve and\r\n  file a record on appeal and final brief under Rules 210 and 211, SCACR.Â  See Rule 231, SCACR.Â  Furthermore, the burden is on the appellant to provide the\r\n  appellate court with an adequate record for review.Â  State v. Williams,\r\n  321 S.C. 455, 464 n.4, 469 S.E.2d 49, 54 n.4 (1996).Â   \r\nIn Ortega-Rodriguez\r\n  v. United States, 507 U.S. 234 (1993), the United States Supreme Court\r\n  found that a rule which automatically dismissed the appeal of a one time\r\n  fugitive was not proper.Â  The Court found that the fact the appellant was a\r\n  fugitive had to â€œhave an impact on the appellate process sufficient to warrant\r\n  an appellate sanction.â€Â  Id. at 249.Â  In addition, the Court noted: â€œa\r\n  long escape, even if ended before sentencing and appeal, may so delay the onset\r\n  of appellate proceedings that the Government would be prejudiced . . . . We\r\n  recognize that this problem might, in some instances, make dismissal an\r\n  appropriate response.â€Â  Id.\r\nSerrette\r\n  points out that our court has the authority to remand for a reconstruction of\r\n  the record pursuant to China v. Parrott, 251 S.C. 329, 162 S.E.2d 276\r\n  (1968); however, such a remedy would undoubtedly be futile considering the\r\n  passage of over ten yearsâ€™ time between conviction and sentencing.[1]Â Â  See State v. Ladson, 373 S.C. 320, 326, 644 S.E.2d 271, 274 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (â€œIt is simply unrealistic and unreasonable to think that a trial\r\n  judge and counsel can â€“ under these circumstances [the passage of fourteen\r\n  months] â€“ reconstruct a proper record that will permit meaningful appellate review,\r\n  especially in light of our issue preservation rules.â€).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Serretteâ€™s own actions are the reason a transcript of the proceedings below is\r\n  not available; this is not a situation where the court reporterâ€™s equipment\r\n  malfunctioned at trial leading to a loss of the trial transcript.Â  See Deaton\r\n    v. Leath, 279 S.C. 82, 84, 302 S.E.2d 335, 336 (1983).Â  We can divine no\r\n  reason why Serrette is entitled to a reconstruction of the record when the destruction\r\n  of the transcript resulted from his willful decision to remain a fugitive.Â \r\n \r\nInstead,\r\n  we find Serretteâ€™s actions have â€œthe kind of connection to the appellate\r\n  process that [justifies] an appellate sanction of dismissal.â€Â  Ortega-Rodriguez,\r\n  507 U.S. at 251 (1993); see also State v. Verikokides, 925 P.2d\r\n  1255, 1256 (Utah 1996) (holding that a criminal appeal may be dismissed if â€œthe\r\n  State can show that it has been prejudiced by the defendantâ€™s absence and the\r\n  consequent lapse of timeâ€); State v. Goree, 659 N.W.2d 344, 348-49 (Neb.\r\n  Ct. App. 2003) (discussing cases in which appeals were dismissed based on the\r\n  appellantâ€™s fugitive status prior to commencement of the appeal); State v.\r\n    Lundahl, 882 P.2d 644 (Or. Ct. App. 1994) (upholding the dismissal of\r\n  defendantâ€™s appeal where defendantâ€™s seven-year fugitive status significantly\r\n  interfered with appellate process); cf. Lamb v. State, 293 S.C.\r\n  174, 359 S.E.2d 282 (1987); Martin v. State, 276 S.C. 514, 280 S.E.2d\r\n  210 (1981); and State v.

Â We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURALÂ \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nDalton was indicted\r\n  for two counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor second degree against\r\n  two step-daughters, fifteen-year-old â€œChild Aâ€ and thirteen-year-old â€œChild B.â€Â \r\n  Respondent was represented by appointed counsel.Â  Concerning the charge\r\n  involving Child A, Dalton pled guilty as indicted to one count of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor second-degree on July 18, 2002.Â  He waived\r\n  presentment on the other charge involving Child B and pled guilty to one count\r\n  of lewd act on a minor.Â  Dalton was sentenced to: (1) twenty years for criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor second-degree, provided upon fifteen years the\r\n  balance would be suspended with five years probation and (2) a concurrent term\r\n  of fifteen years for lewd act on a minor.Â   \r\nAt the guilty plea\r\n  hearing, evidence of Daltonâ€™s guilt on the charge involving Child A was\r\n  presented.Â  The solicitor told the judge that Child A said Dalton fondled her, had\r\n  sexual intercourse with her at least four times, and engaged in oral sex.Â  The\r\n  judge was informed that Child B reported Dalton fondled her and made some oral\r\n  sexual contact.Â  Dalton admitted to a Department of Social Services caseworker\r\n  that he would â€œeat [Child A] out,â€ but he denied having sex.Â  Additionally, Dalton gave a statement to police confessing he did have sex with Child A.Â  Dalton only disagreed with the length of time over which the events occurred.\r\n \r\nDaltonâ€™s counsel at\r\n  the plea hearing indicated he had explained to Dalton the charges, the possible\r\n  punishment, his constitutional rights including his right to a jury trial, and\r\n  his right to present the lewd act charge to a grand jury.Â  Counsel said Dalton understood and wished to plead guilty.Â  The plea court advised Dalton that by entering\r\n  a guilty plea he would give up his constitutional rights to (1) remain silent\r\n  and not be compelled to testify against himself; (2) be tried by a jury of\r\n  peers or equals to which the State would be required to prove his guilt beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt; and (3) confront and cross-examine witnesses presented\r\n  against him as well as his right to call witnesses in his own behalf.Â   \r\nRegarding\r\n  the lewd act charge, the plea court explained it was not a lesser included\r\n  offense of criminal sexual conduct second degree and it had not been presented\r\n  to a grand jury. Â The court informed Dalton a grand jury could determine probable\r\n  cause and a trial would follow, or the grand jury could return a no bill.Â  The\r\n  plea court asked:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDo you understand that process?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAnd do you still wish to give up \r\n\t\t\tyour right of presentment of this charge to the Grand Jury.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  assuring Dalton understood the constitutional rights that he would be giving up\r\n  by pleading guilty, the colloquy continued as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tUnderstanding the nature of the \r\n\t\t\tcharges against you and the consequences of a guilty plea, how do \r\n\t\t\tyou plead to these charges, guilty or not guilty?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tGuilty.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tDo you understand \r\n\t\t\tthat, when you plead guilty, that you will waive or give up any \r\n\t\t\tpossible defenses that you might have to these charges?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd do you also understand that, \r\n\t\t\tif youâ€™ve given an incriminating statement in this case, that, by \r\n\t\t\tpleading guilty, that you will waive or give up the right to contest \r\n\t\t\tor challenge whether such a statement was freely and voluntarily \r\n\t\t\tgiven in accordance with your constitutional rights?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\t(Nods affirmatively.)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tDid you commit these offenses?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe plea court\r\n  asked Dalton whether he understood the recommended concurrent sentences were\r\n  not binding and he could be sentenced to the maximum on both charges.Â  Dalton answered affirmatively.Â  The court continued:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tYou still wish to enter your \r\n\t\t\tplea of guilty?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tNow, Mr. Dalton, when you enter \r\n\t\t\ta plea of guiltyâ€”has anyone promised you anything or threatened you \r\n\t\t\tin order to get you to enter this plea of guilty?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tNo, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAre you entering this plea of \r\n\t\t\tyour own free will and accord?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir, I am.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAre you satisfied with the \r\n\t\t\tmanner in which [your counsel] has advised and represented you?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes, sir.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tDo you need any more time to \r\n\t\t\tspeak with him?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tNo.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tYou feel that heâ€™s done \r\n\t\t\teverything for you that he could have or should have done?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWell, heâ€™s â€“ no, not really.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI believe that he, he needs to bring up the fact that I know Iâ€™m \r\n\t\t\tguilty and I admit my fault here.&nbsp; But I have no criminal prior \r\n\t\t\trecord at this, this matter.

State, 310 S.C. 8, 11, 425\r\n  S.E.2d 25, 27 (1992); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624\r\n  (1989).Â  In a PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of proving the\r\n  allegations in their application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441,\r\n  442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985); Rule 71.1(e), SCRCP.\r\nWhere ineffective assistance of counsel is alleged as a ground for\r\n  relief, the applicant must prove that â€œcounselâ€™s conduct so undermined the\r\n  proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied\r\n  upon as having produced a just result.â€Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 669, (1984); Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985).Â  The\r\n  proper measure of performance is whether the attorney provided representation\r\n  within the range of competence required in criminal cases.Â  The courts presume\r\n  that counsel rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in\r\n  the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.Â  The applicant must overcome this presumption in order to receive relief.Â  Cherry,\r\n  300 S.C. at 118, 386 S.E.2d at 625.Â   \r\nA two-pronged test is used in evaluating allegations of\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  A PCR applicant who pleads guilty on the\r\n  advice of counsel may collaterally attack the plea only by showing that (1)\r\n  counsel was ineffective and (2) there is a reasonable probability that but for\r\n  counselâ€™s errors, the applicant would not have pled guilty and would have\r\n  insisted on going to trial.Â  Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. 16, 20, 546\r\n  S.E.2d 417, 419 (2001).Â  When alleging that his guilty plea was induced by\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, an applicant must prove that counselâ€™s\r\n  advice was not â€œwithin the competence demanded of attorneys in criminal\r\n  cases.â€Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56 (1985).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDalton argued his guilty plea was involuntary due to trial\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to interview witnesses before advising him to plead guilty.Â  In\r\n  the order granting Daltonâ€™s application for relief, the PCR court agreed and\r\n  annunciated in its order: Â \r\n\r\n\tHad applicantâ€™s trial counsel consulted with the\r\n  witnesses given him by the applicant, there is reasonable probability that\r\n  results of proceedings could have been different.Â  As argued by Applicant,\r\n  Trial Counselâ€™s failure to interview any of the witnesses left this Applicant\r\n  with no defense or evidence of mitigation at trial, effectively forcing him to\r\n  throw himself upon the mercy of the court.\r\n\tThe Court finds Trial Counselâ€™s argument that it was\r\n  needless to interview witnesses due to Applicantâ€™s Statement is not\r\n  convincing.Â  Applicantâ€™s Statement did not address the charges comprising the\r\n  lewd act, and was less conclusive on all elements of the CSC second degree\r\n  charge.Â  Applicantâ€™s witness who testified at the PCR Hearing called into\r\n  question the credibility of the complaining witness and presented facts through\r\n  which impeachment might have been obtained.Â  Her testimony also presented other\r\n  aspects of the events leading to the charges in a light substantially different\r\n  from that presented by the Solicitor.Â  Trial Counsel argued that had he\r\n  elicited such anticipated testimony it would have served to anger the Judge.Â \r\n  Considering Applicant is the one who received the twenty year sentence,\r\n  Applicant should have been afforded that decision based on counselâ€™s informed\r\n  advice after counsel had actually heard what the witnesses had to say.\r\n\tI find that Trial Counselâ€™s representation fell below\r\n  an objective standard of reasonableness and it is a reasonable probability that\r\n  as a result the outcome of Applicantâ€™s court appearance would have been\r\n  different.Â  Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to interview defense\r\n  witnesses made known to him.Â  Consequently, Counsel was unable to objectively\r\n  evaluate Applicantâ€™s defense and intelligently advise Applicant.Â  The negative\r\n  effect of counselâ€™s errors amounts to deficient performance which affected the\r\n  outcome of the Applicantâ€™s court appearance.Â  \r\n\r\nThe State contends that the PCR court\r\n  erred in granting Dalton relief.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nA guilty plea is a solemn, judicial admission of the truth of the\r\n  charges against an individual; thus, a criminal inmateâ€™s right to contest the\r\n  validity of such a plea is usually, but not invariably, foreclosed.Â  Blackledge\r\n    v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63 (1977).Â  Therefore, statements made during a guilty\r\n  plea should be considered conclusive unless a criminal inmate presents valid\r\n  reasons why he should be allowed to depart from the truth of his statements.Â  Crawford\r\n    v. United States, 519 F.2d 317 (4th Cir. 1975); Edmonds v. Lewis, 546 F.2d 566 (4th Cir. 1976).Â  An applicant may\r\n  attack the voluntary, knowing, and intelligent character of a guilty plea\r\n  entered on the advice of counsel by demonstrating that counselâ€™s representation\r\n  was below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Porter v. State, 368\r\n  S.C. 378, 383-84, 629 S.E.2d 353, 356 (2006); Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C.\r\n  16, 20, 546 S.E.2d 417, 419 (2001).Â  The â€œprejudice,â€ requirement focuses on\r\n  whether counselâ€™s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome\r\n  of the plea process.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985).Â  In\r\n  other words, the applicant must prove prejudice by showing that, but for\r\n  counselâ€™s inadequacy, there is a reasonable probability he would not have\r\n  pleaded guilty and, instead, would have insisted on going to trial.Â  Suber\r\n    v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).Â  Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nTo find\r\n  a guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly entered into, the record must\r\n  establish the defendant had a full understanding of the consequences of his\r\n  plea and the charges against him.Â  Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969); Roddy v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 33-34, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421\r\n  (2000).Â  â€œA defendantâ€™s knowing and voluntary waiver of the constitutional\r\n  rights which accompany a guilty plea may be accomplished by colloquy between\r\n  the Court and the defendant, between the Court and defendantâ€™s counsel, or\r\n  both.â€Â  Pittman v. State, 337 S.C. 597, 625, 524 S.E.2d 623, 659\r\n  (1999).Â   \r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  voluntariness of a guilty plea is not determined by an examination of the\r\n  specific inquiry made by the sentencing judge alone, but is determined from\r\n  both the record made at the time of the entry of the guilty plea and the record\r\n  of the post-conviction hearing.â€Â  Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 133,\r\n  318 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1984).Â  â€œWhen determining issues relating to guilty pleas,\r\n  this Court will consider the entire record, including the transcript of the\r\n  guilty pleas and the evidence presented at the PCR hearing.â€Â  Roddy, 339\r\n  S.C. at 33, 528 S.E.2d at 420.Â  In considering an allegation on PCR that a guilty\r\n  plea was based on inaccurate advice of counsel, the transcript of the guilty\r\n  plea hearing will be considered to determine whether any possible error by\r\n  counsel was cured by the information conveyed at the plea hearing.Â  Wolfe v.\r\n    State, 326 S.C. 158, 165, 485 S.E.2d 367, 370 (1997).Â   \r\n1.&nbsp; Ineffective\r\n  Assistance of Counsel\r\nThe\r\n  PCR court granted relief based solely on counselâ€™s failure to interview\r\n  witnesses.Â  Despite Daltonâ€™s statements to police and to DSS and his telling\r\n  appointed counsel his crack habit caused him to act out of character, Dalton\r\n  avers this failure forced him to plead guilty because it left him without any\r\n  defense.Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Dalton maintained three witnesses could have helped his case:Â \r\n  Faith Dalton (Faith), his ex-wife and mother of Child B; Sonya Cowart, his\r\n  sister with whom he was living when charges were filed; and Tom Scruggs, his former\r\n  employer.Â  Daltonâ€™s attorney questioned him on the support these witnesses\r\n  could have provided.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAnd the question is, had he \r\n\t\t\tcontacted the witnesses what would he have learned that would have \r\n\t\t\thelped your case?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m not my \r\n\t\t\twitnesses, I donâ€™t know what they know.&nbsp; But I know that I was \r\n\t\t\tgoing to use them as my witnesses.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDalton gave only general statements about how the women\r\n  would have supported his case and he did not discuss Scruggs.Â  He stated Faith,\r\n  the complainant on Child Bâ€™s incident report, lived with Child B and knew of her\r\n  â€œactivities and veracityâ€; and his sister would have been a beneficial witness\r\n  because she had been around him and the child and knew of the childâ€™s â€œactivities.â€ \r\n\r\nDaltonâ€™s appointed counsel admitted Dalton had expressed\r\n  concern over the victimâ€™s dress and manner of conduct both in his statement to\r\n  police and in their conversations.Â  From the record, it appears this discussion\r\n  concerned Child A.Â  Counsel reasoned this was inadmissible, not a defense to\r\n  having sex with a person under the age of sixteen, and possibly harmful to Daltonâ€™s case.Â  Given the substantial evidence against Dalton, counsel focused on reducing\r\n  the charges which carried a possible sentence of fifty-five years.Â  Daltonâ€™s PCR counsel only lightly addressed the witness issue when he asked appointed\r\n  counsel:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd did he ever provide you with the names of \r\n\t\t\tpotential defense witnesses?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWe talked about numerous witnesses.&nbsp; I \r\n\t\t\tlooked through my file, I didnâ€™t have a list of thirty-three, but \r\n\t\t\tthere was a lot.&nbsp; But the thing about his witnesses were as the \r\n\t\t\twitnesses testified in his statement and the victimâ€™s statement they \r\n\t\t\tboth say they were the only ones there.&nbsp; He had no witnesses \r\n\t\t\twho were going to say, â€œWell, I was there and it didnâ€™t happen.â€&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAll of his witnesses revolved around the fact that the girl \r\n\t\t\tconducted herself in what they felt was in an inappropriate manner, \r\n\t\t\twhich is of no help and no use.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  do not agree with the PCR court that Dalton established ineffective assistance\r\n  of his court appointed attorney.Â  The transcript of the guilty plea clearly\r\n  refutes Daltonâ€™s assertion that he believed he had a defense.Â  At the PCR\r\n  hearing, he was unable to explain how he would have benefited from these\r\n  witnessesâ€™ testimony.Â  See Jackson v. State, 329 S.C. 345,\r\n  353-54, S.E.2d 768, 772 (1998) (counsel not proven ineffective where\r\n  â€œrespondent failed to present any evidence of what counsel would have\r\n  discovered or what other defenses respondent would have requested counsel\r\n  pursue had counsel more fully prepared for trialâ€); Moorehead v.

alleged to be slander per se.Â  The trial court denied Parrishâ€™s motions\r\n  for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  The jury returned\r\n  a verdict for Allison.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL /\r\n  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant\r\n  Parrish is the great-niece of Allison.Â  Over the years, family disagreements\r\n  have resulted in numerous insinuations and incidents by both sides.Â  Frequently\r\n  at issue was the family land which has been divided over time between Allison,\r\n  Parrish, and others.Â  The events leading to this defamation action arose when\r\n  Parrish began efforts to have the county close a portion of road where her land\r\n  is located.Â  At a Laurens County Council (the Council) meeting, Parrish\r\n  appeared and voiced her concerns regarding the safety of the road.Â  Allison\r\n  expressed his opposition at a subsequent council meeting where he made the\r\n  statements at issue.Â  Specifically, Allison said Parrish had (a) â€œconned his\r\n  mother [Parrishâ€™s great-grandmother] into signing her land over to [Parrish],â€\r\n  and (b) â€œconned [his mother] out of her insurance money.â€\r\nPrior\r\n  to the meetings, Parrish visited Allison at his home to discuss her intentions\r\n  to ask the county to close the road.Â  Although Allison initially told Parrish\r\n  he was neutral, he later decided to oppose the closing.Â  Allisonâ€™s change in\r\n  position was sparked by an article he read in the local newspaper.Â  It reported\r\n  that Parrish, at the first meeting, told the Council a man fell off a golf cart\r\n  and was run over on the road.Â  Allison knew this incident never happened.Â \r\n  However, Parrishâ€™s testimony revealed her nephew fell off a go-cart in another\r\n  locale and was run over leaving him with a lengthy recovery.Â  The record\r\n  established that the newspaper had misquoted Parrish.Â  At trial, Parrish said\r\n  she told the Council of her nephewâ€™s ordeal to illuminate the devastation of\r\n  â€œfreak accidents.â€Â   \r\nAt the inception of the second county council meeting, an\r\n  announcement was made clarifying the newspaper had reported incorrectly.Â \r\n  Allison, advanced in years and hard of hearing, was present but testified\r\n  repeatedly he did not hear the correction.Â  He proceeded to make his statements\r\n  believing Parrish had told a lie and the Council would rely on a fabrication in deciding whether to\r\n  close the road.Â  Allison made\r\n  the following statements about Parrish: â€œShe lied about different things . . .\r\n  .Â  [S]he lied about a man getting ran over.â€Â   \r\n\r\n\tI donâ€™t know why she is driving this so\r\n  hard with lies to get it accomplished.Â  [T]he point about the man getting run\r\n  over on Allison Road is an absolute lie.Â  This is the most outrageous thing I\r\n  have ever heard.Â  This should have been kicked out the first time she came in\r\n  here with this big tale.Â  We have had trouble with this woman ever since she\r\n  has been living in Hickory Tavern.Â  The things that she has done and gotten by\r\n  with . . . . she got by with cutting Tony Lollis water line and blocking the\r\n  road off.Â  I want to tell you how kind-hearted she is.Â  My mother lived to be\r\n  an old, old woman.Â  She conned her into signing the whole place . . . house,\r\n    land and furniture, two insurance policies.Â  She did not show up at the\r\n  funeral.Â  She did not show up at the Mortuary and paid not one penny towards\r\n  the funeral.Â  The two insurance policies were for her funeral.Â  She is a\r\n  dangerous woman.Â  (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nAllison does not deny making the statements though testimony is\r\n  inconsistent as to whether he used â€œconnedâ€ to imply â€œstoleâ€ or â€œpersuaded.â€Â  In a deposition, Allison insisted on the\r\n  truth of his statements and answered the questions of Parrishâ€™s attorney as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tYou wanted her to be known as a \r\n\t\t\tliar in the community?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:

\r\n\t\t\tRight.&nbsp; Exactly right.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tBut\r\n  on direct examination by Parrishâ€™s attorney, Allison testified:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tNow, Mr. Allison, when you

am sorry if you feel like I am up to\r\n  something, I am just here asking questions.Â  What I want to know is the truth\r\n  about this matter and this.Â  You could have spoken against the closing of the\r\n  road without calling Kim Parrish a liar, couldnâ€™t?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tWell, I thought it would be best to reveal her\r\n  character and let the county council know that the road shouldnâ€™t be closed on\r\n  that statement, that a man was run over.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. .\r\n  .

it.&nbsp; But she \r\n\t\t\tsigned everything she had to my sister, I didnâ€™t find this out until \r\n\t\t\tmy mother died.&nbsp; And before my mother died my sister signed \r\n\t\t\teverything over to Kim Parrish.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd what--?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tAnd with all the children and \r\n\t\t\tgrandchildren I donâ€™t see why, there was 41 of us and the one person \r\n\t\t\tshe picked out was Kim.&nbsp; But that was working between my sister \r\n\t\t\tand Kim.&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tNow, what

\r\n\t\t\tmother, no doubt about that.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court denied Parrishâ€™s motion for directed verdict at the close of\r\n  Allisonâ€™s case.Â  Prior to jury instructions, Parrish renewed her objection\r\n  that Allison had not pled the affirmative defense of truth.Â  The trial\r\n  court ruled â€œI certainly think that reading the answer in a liberal manner,\r\n  even though it is an affirmative defense I think that it was affirmatively\r\n  stated that they were going to plead that.â€Â  The trial court charged the jury:\r\n  â€œThe defendant must prove by a greater weight of the preponderance of the evidence\r\n  that the statement was substantially true or true in substance.Â  A statement is\r\n  not defamatory if it is essentially true.â€Â  The jury returned a verdict\r\n  in Allisonâ€™s favor.Â  The trial court denied Parrishâ€™s motions for a new trial\r\n  or judgment not withstanding the verdict.Â   \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial judge err in \r\n\t\t\tdenying motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding \r\n\t\t\tthe verdict because the statements of the respondent constituted \r\n\t\t\tslander per se?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial judge err in \r\n\t\t\tallowing Allison to present truth as a defense and in charging the \r\n\t\t\tjury on truth when truth was not pled as an affirmative defense?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an\r\n  action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of the\r\n

App. 1997).  \r\nLAW /\r\n  ANALYSIS\r\nParrish contends the trial judge erred in denying her motions for\r\n  directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Allisonâ€™s\r\n  statements constituted slander per se.Â  Following our supreme courtâ€™s\r\n  directive in Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502,\r\n  508, 506 S.E.2d 497, 502 (1998), we will analyze this slander action in two\r\n  parts.Â  A statement is (1) either defamatory per se or defamatory per\r\n    quod, and (2) actionable per se or not actionable per se.Â  See also Goodwin v. Kennedy, 347 S.C. 30, 552 S.E.2d 319, n.1 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).\r\nI.&nbsp; Defamatory Per\r\n  Se or Defamatory Per Quod\r\nThe tort of defamation allows a plaintiff to recover for injury to\r\n  his or her reputation as the result of the defendantâ€™s communications to others\r\n  of a false message about the plaintiff.Â  Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 508,\r\n  506 S.E.2d at 502; Murrray v. Holnam, 344 S.C. 129, 138, 542 S.E.2d 743,\r\n  748 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Defamatory communications take two forms:Â  libel and\r\n  slander.Â  Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 508, 506 S.E.2d at 502.Â  Libel is\r\n  the publication of defamatory material by written or printed words, by its\r\n  embodiment in physical form or by any other form of communication that has the\r\n  potentially harmful qualities characteristic of written or printed word.Â  Id. at 517, 506 S.E.2d at 505 (Toal, J., concurring); Restatement (Second) of Torts,\r\n  Â§ 568 (1977).Â  Slander is a spoken defamation.Â  Id. at 508, 506 S.E.2d\r\n  at 501; see also Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit,\r\n  334 S.C. 469, 484, 514 S.E.2d 126, 134 (1999).Â   \r\nTo recover for defamation, the plaintiff must establish by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, that there was (1) a false and defamatory\r\n  statement by the defendant concerning the plaintiff; (2) an unprivileged\r\n  communication; (3) fault on the defendantâ€™s part in publishing the statement;\r\n  and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or\r\n  the existence of special harm to the plaintiff caused by the publication.Â  Holtzscheiter,\r\n  332 S.C. at 518, 506 S.E.2d at 506 (Toal, J., concurring); Fleming v. Rose,\r\n  350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).  \r\nâ€œA\r\n  communication is defamatory if it tends to harm the reputation of another as to\r\n  lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from\r\n  associating with him.â€Â  Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 530, 506 S.E.2d at\r\n  513 (Toal, J., concurring).Â  With this first element of defamation, the trial\r\n  court must initially determine if the communication is reasonably capable of\r\n  conveying a defamatory meaning.Â  Id. at 530, 506 S.E.2d at 513; White\r\n    v. Wilkerson, 328 S.C. 179, 183, 493 S.E.2d 345, 347 (1997).Â  If the\r\n  defamatory meaning of a message or statement is obvious on the face of the\r\n  statement, the statement is defamatory per se.Â  Holtzscheiter,\r\n  332 S.C. at 508-09, 506 S.E.2d at 501.Â  â€œIf the defamatory meaning is not clear\r\n  unless the hearer knows the facts or circumstances not contained in the\r\n  statement itself, then the statement is defamatory per quod.Â Â  In cases\r\n  involving defamation per quod, the plaintiff must introduce facts\r\n  extrinsic to the statement itself in order to prove a defamatory meaning.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œIf the question is one on which reasonable minds might differ,\r\n  then it is for the jury to determine which of the two permissible views they\r\n  will take.â€Â  Id. at 530, 506 S.E.2d at 512 (Toal, J., concurring).Â  Some\r\n  statements are so clearly innocent or defamatory the court is justified in\r\n  determining the question itself.Â  Id.Â  â€œIn making the determination of\r\n  whether to submit the issue to the jury, the trial court may consider not only\r\n  the statement on its face, but also evidence of any extrinsic facts and\r\n  circumstances.â€Â  Id.Â   \r\nHere, after Parrish had presented her witnesses, both parties\r\n  moved for and were denied motions for directed verdict.Â  The trial judge\r\n  stated, â€œWhile I think the statements may in fact be defamatory, that only\r\n  establishes one element that the plaintiff would have to prove.â€Â  Without\r\n  committing to a finding of defamatory per se, the judge explained that\r\n  whether they were actionable per se was an additional element over which\r\n  conflicting testimony had created a jury issue.Â   \r\nII.Â \r\n  Actionable Per Se or Not Actionable Per Se\r\nIn addition\r\n  to being defamatory per se or per quod, â€œ[a] separate issue is\r\n  whether the statement is â€˜actionable per seâ€™ or not.Â  This issue is one\r\n  of pleading and proof, and is always a question of law for the court.â€Â  Holtzscheiter,\r\n  332 S.C. at 510, 506 S.E.2d at 502; Capps v. Watts, 271 S.C. 276, 246\r\n  S.E.2d 606 (1978).Â  If the defamation is actionable per se, the law\r\n  presumes the defendant acted with common law malice and that the plaintiff\r\n  suffered general damages.Â  If the defamation is not actionable per se,\r\n  then the plaintiff must plead and prove common law actual malice and special\r\n  damages.Â  Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 510, 506 S.E.2d at 502.\r\nWhen assessing the question of actionable per se or not\r\n  actionable per se, an important distinction is drawn between the\r\n  defamation in the form of libel and in the form of slander.Â  With libel, â€œif\r\n  the trial judge can legally presume, because of the nature of the statement,\r\n  that the plaintiffâ€™s reputation was hurt as a consequence of its publication,\r\n  then the libel is actionable per se.â€Â  Id. at 510, 506 S.E.2d at\r\n  502.Â  In contrariety, â€œslander is actionable per se only if it charges\r\n  the plaintiff with one of five types of acts or characteristics:Â  (1)\r\n  commission of a crime of moral turpitude; (2) contraction of a loathsome\r\n  disease; (3) adultery; (4) unchastity; or (5) unfitness in oneâ€™s business or\r\n  profession.â€Â  Id. at 511, 506 S.E.2d at 502.Â  â€œIn all other\r\n  casesâ€”namely, when slander does not fall into the above-named\r\n  categories-special damages must be established.â€Â  Id. at 526, 506 S.E.2d\r\n  at 510 (Toal, J., concurring).\r\nIn the case sub judice, Parrish argues the\r\n  statements charge her with a crime of moral turpitude.Â  She avers the\r\n  allegations made by Allison are unambiguous and not susceptible of innocent\r\n  construction.Â  We found no case in South Carolina that specifically addressed\r\n  the nature of the word â€œcon.â€Â  However, dictionary definitions include swindle,\r\n  manipulate, persuade, and cajole.Â  See, e.g., Merriam Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed.\r\n  1993).Â  A few cases from\r\n  other jurisdictions considered this term and held â€œconâ€ can have an innocent\r\n  meaning.Â  See Quinn v. Jewel Food Stores, Inc., 658 N.E.2d 1225\r\n  (Ill. App. Ct. 1995) (finding terms including â€œcon artistâ€ as contained in\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s employee evaluation form capable of innocent meaning); Rizzuto\r\n    v. The Nexxus Products Co., 641 F. Supp. 473 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (in context of\r\n  trade journal advertisement, phrases including â€œdonâ€™t be connedâ€ are mere\r\n  rhetorical hyperbole rather than accusation of criminal conduct and use of word\r\n  â€œconnedâ€ was an expression of opinion not giving rise to action for libel).Â \r\n \r\nSouth Carolina law allows contemplation of the context and circumstances under which words are\r\n  spoken when determining if the words have a defamatory meaning or are\r\n  actionable per se.Â  The resolution of conflicting meanings is reserved\r\n  for the jury.Â  In Smith v. Smith, 194 S.C. 247, 9 S.E.2d 584, 589\r\n  (1940), our supreme court instructed:\r\n\r\n\tIf words are susceptible of two meanings, one imputing a crime,\r\n  and the other innocence, the latter is not to be adopted, and the other\r\n  rejected, as a matter of course.Â  In such a case, it must be left to the jury\r\n  to decide in what sense defendant used them.Â  Their conclusion must be formed\r\n  from the whole of the circumstances attending the publication, including the\r\n  sense in which the witnesses understood the words.\r\n\r\nId. at 257, 72 S.E.2d at 589 (quoting Jenkins\r\n  v.

Kennedy,\r\n  347 S.C. 30, 552 S.E.2d 319 (Ct. App. 2001) (rejecting defendantâ€™s argument\r\n  that if context is considered then statement cannot, as a matter of law, be\r\n  actionable per se; affirming submission to jury issue of whether\r\n  defendant stating plaintiff acting like a â€œhouse n****râ€ in his position as\r\n  vice-principal actionable per se); Wardlaw v. Peck, 282 S.C. 199,\r\n  318 S.E.2d 270 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œHow the words were to be understood in the\r\n  circumstances in which they were uttered was a question for the jury, not the\r\n  court, to decide.â€).\r\nWhen denying both partiesâ€™ directed verdict motions made at the end\r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s case, the judge stated:\r\n\r\n\tI think there has been conflicting testimony as to whether or not\r\n  those statements taken in their entirety, interpreting those based upon the\r\n  circumstances would be slander per se.Â  While the, I think the meaning of the\r\n  word, conned, is certainly a common term that anyone could define and that is\r\n  what constitutes the defamation.Â  Whether or not that is in fact computing that\r\n  she was, or has committed a crime of moral turpitude would be something that\r\n  the jury would have to consider in light of all the statements and the acts and\r\n  circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  parties again moved for directed verdicts after the close of the defendantâ€™s\r\n  case, and the judge reiterated:\r\n\r\n\tI think there is a jury question\r\n  that exist [sic] as to whether or not the statements made were slanderous per\r\n  se, whether or not the statements reasonably may be understood to charge the\r\n  plaintiff with the crime of larceny or breach of trust or some other offense.Â \r\n  I think it is something that the jury will have to determine based on the\r\n  totality of the statements and the circumstances under which they were made.Â \r\n  So, I am going to allow it to go the jury for that consideration.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter the jury returned a verdict for Allison, Parrish moved for\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  The judge denied the motion and said:\r\n\r\n\tAs to the slander per se, I think there was evidence that required\r\n  the jury to make a determination as to whether the words spoken would of put\r\n  the person who heard it in, to know what was being charged was a crime of moral\r\n  turpitude and that became a jury issue which they ultimately decided.\r\n\r\nParrish posits the holdings of Lily v. Belkâ€™s Depâ€™t Store,\r\n  178 S.C. 278, 182 S.E. 889 (1935) and Herring v. Lawrence Warehouse Co.,\r\n  222 S.C. 226, 72 S.E.2d 453 (1952), demand the reversal of the trial court.Â  In Lily, the plaintiff left a department store after making a purchase but\r\n  was stopped by a store clerk.Â  He told her he wanted to see what she had put in\r\n  the bags, and he searched the bags in the presence of people on the street.Â  A\r\n  jury found for the plaintiff in her subsequent slander action.Â  On appeal, the\r\n  defendant alleged the trial court erred in denying his motion for a nonsuit\r\n  based on the ground that the testimony neither supported an action for slander\r\n  because the language did not charge the plaintiff with a crime, nor did it did\r\n  become actionable by virtue of the circumstances.Â   \r\nThe court held a charge of a crime need not be express but, with\r\n  verbal slander, words are to be given their ordinary and popular meaning.Â  And\r\n  when words are susceptible of an innocent meaning and one imputing a crime, the\r\n  jury must decide in what sense they were used.Â  Id. at 282, 182 S.E. at\r\n  891.Â  The court instructed â€œwhere\r\n  the words used are not actionable in themselves, they require the pleading of\r\n  an innuendo to explain or determine their defamatory nature, and in such case\r\n  are said to be [not actionable per se].â€ Id.[1]Â  Applying Lily to the case at bar, we hold Allisonâ€™s\r\n  statements carried sufficient possibility of defamation to support an action,\r\n  but whether they equated to the charge of a crime was properly submitted to the\r\n  jury.Â   \r\nParrish cites Herring v. Lawrence Warehouse Co., 222 S.C.\r\n  226, 72 S.E.2d 453 (1952), to assert â€œconâ€ must be actionable per se if\r\n  calling an employee â€œshortâ€ was so held.Â  In Herring, an auditor accused\r\n  the plaintiff, a warehouse manager, of being â€œshortâ€ on equipment entrusted to\r\n  his care.Â  The plaintiff was immediately fired. Our supreme court held the\r\n  statement was unambiguous and actionable per se.Â  The holding was not based solely on the language, but the scale\r\n  was tipped by the courtâ€™s evaluation of the circumstances.Â  â€œWhen considered in\r\n  connection with the fact that appellant was immediately discharged and the keys\r\n  of the warehouse demanded, it is clear that appellant was charged with the\r\n  commission of a crime.â€Â  Id. at 235, 552 S.E.2d at 455.Â  The reaction of the hearers led the\r\n  court to hold the statement unquestionably charged a crime.Â  Parrish has not\r\n  shown equivalent evidence upon which a similar finding may be based.\r\nWe hold the trial judge did not err in denying Parrishâ€™s motions\r\n  for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to Allison, there was evidence that the statements, though decidedly\r\n  unflattering, were reasonably susceptible of a construction short of a crime of\r\n  moral turpitude.Â  Conflicting testimony over whether the statements meant\r\n  Parrish persuaded Allisonâ€™s mother or stole from her created a credibility\r\n  issue.Â  Accordingly, whether the statements were defamatory per se and\r\n  actionable per se was a question for the jury as the finders of fact.Â  \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Truth as an\r\n  Affirmative Defense to Defamation\r\nParrish contends the trial court erred in allowing\r\n  Allison to assert the truth of his statements, even though he did not\r\n  affirmatively plead it as a defense in his answer.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder\r\n  common law, a defamatory communication was presumed to be false, but truth\r\n  could be asserted as an affirmative defense.Â  See Beckham v. Sun News,\r\n  289 S.C. 28, 30, 344 S.E.2d 603, 604 (1986); see also Herring v.\r\n    Lawrence Warehouse Co., 222 S.C. 226, 234, 72 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1952)\r\n  (holding South Carolina jurisprudence has consistently held statements that are\r\n  actionable per se are presumed false).Â  However, the Supreme Courtâ€™s\r\n  holding in Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 768-69,\r\n  (1986), modified the common law rule holding when a newspaper publishes speech\r\n  of public concern, a private figure plaintiff cannot recover damages without\r\n  showing the statements are false.Â  If the statements are a matter of private\r\n  concern, the plaintiff is not required to prove falsity.Â  Id.Â  Thus, truth is an affirmative defense as to which the\r\n  defendant has the burden of pleading and proof, unless the statement involves a constitutional issue.Â  See Hubbard and Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 468, 478 (2d. ed.\r\n  1997).\r\nA\r\n  party, in pleading to a preceding pleading, shall affirmatively set forth his\r\n  defenses to the opposing partyâ€™s complaint.Â  Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  Further,\r\n  â€œ[e]very defense, in law or fact, to a cause of action in any pleading, whether\r\n  a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party\r\n  claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto . . . .â€Â  Rule\r\n  12(b), SCRCP.Â  Generally, affirmative defenses to a cause of\r\n  action in any pleading must\r\n  be asserted in a partyâ€™s responsive pleading.Â  Strickland v. Strickland, Op. No.\r\n  26375, (S.C. Filed August 27, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32 at 58) (citing Wright\r\n    v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 20-21, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App. 2006)).Â  â€œThe\r\n  failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver of the right to\r\n  assert it.â€Â  Craft, 372 S.C. at 21, 640 S.E.2d at 497&nbsp;(citing Adams\r\n    v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, 419, 377 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1989)). \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  construing a complaint or responsive pleading, the court must review the entire\r\n  pleading.Â  See Doe ex rel. Legal Guardian v. Barnwell School Dist. 45,\r\n  369 S.C. 659, 663, 633 S.E.2d 518, 520 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  â€œTo ensure substantial\r\n  justice to the parties, the pleadings must be liberally construed.â€Â  Gaskins\r\n    v. S. Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., 343 S.C. 666, 671, 541 S.E.2d 269, 271\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d as modified on other grounds, 354 S.C. 416, 581\r\n  S.E.2d 169 (2003); see Rule 8(f), SCRCP (providing that all pleadings\r\n  must be construed to do substantial justice to all parties).Â Â   \r\nA defamatory\r\n  communication is presumed to be false under the common law.Â  The plaintiff does\r\n  not have the burden of proving falsity.Â  However, truth can be asserted as an\r\n  affirmative defense, the burden of which is on the defendant.Â  The trial court\r\n  allowed Allison to assert the truth of his accusation in the presentation of\r\n  his case.Â  In addition, the trial court instructed the jury that â€œthe defendant must prove by a greater\r\n  weight of the preponderance of the evidence that the statement was\r\n  substantially true or true in substance.â€Â  The charge afforded Allison the\r\n  benefit of the affirmative defense of truth without his being required to affirmatively\r\n  plead it.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  response to Parrishâ€™s objection, the trial court explained Allisonâ€™s answer,\r\n  read liberally, â€œaffirmatively stated that they were going to plead [truth as a\r\n  defense].â€Â  Our reading of the responsive pleading as a whole mandates a different\r\n  interpretation.Â  Allisonâ€™s denial of Parrishâ€™s claims was not directly based on\r\n  the assertion that the communication was true, but instead focused on Allisonâ€™s\r\n  intention, mistake in speaking out of context, and apology.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Allison asserted:\r\n\r\n\tthat he did not intend to make any false and malicious\r\n  accusations against the plaintiff in any regard and can only apologize and\r\n  offer the plaintiff assurances that the defendant bears no ill will against the\r\n  plaintiff and regrets that any statements may have been made that anywise\r\n  questions the plaintiffâ€™s integrity . . . .\r\n\t[T]he defendant would again allege and show that to the extent any\r\n  comments were made out of context and inappropriate, those in attendance\r\n  realize the circumstances of the dispute concerning the closing of the road,\r\n  and the defendant does apologize for any intemperate remarks which should not\r\n  have been uttered or said in any regard.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  acknowledge the rule compels reading the pleadings as a whole, liberally, and\r\n  with the purpose of ensuring substantial justice to the parties.Â  However, in\r\n  this instance, even the most liberal reading fails to persuade us that Allison\r\n  affirmatively asserted the defense that his statements made about Parrish were\r\n  true.Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  Allisonâ€™s statements about Parrish did not constitute slander per se.Â \r\n  We rule that Allison failed to plead truth as an affirmative defense.Â  The\r\n  trial court erred in allowing Allison to argue truth as a defense and in\r\n  charging truth as a defense.Â  Accordingly the case is  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWilliams,\r\n  J., concurs.Â  \r\nShort, J., concurs in result in a separate opinion.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSHORT, J.,\r\n  concurs in result.\r\nI\r\n  concur with the majority that the judgment must be reversed based on the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s error in allowing Allison to assert truth, even though he did not\r\n  affirmatively plead truth as a defense.Â  I write separately, however, because I\r\n  believe the trial court also erred in failing to direct a verdict on the issue\r\n  of slander per se.\r\nIn light of the attendant circumstances, I find Allisonâ€™s\r\n  statements charged Parrish with the commission of a crime of moral turpitude.Â  See Flowers v. Price, 192 S.C. 373, 378, 6 S.E.2d 750, 752 (1940)\r\n  (considering extrinsic circumstances to determine if words are slanderous per se).Â \r\n  At the meeting, Allison stated that Parrish â€œconnedâ€ his mother into signing\r\n  over her land and â€œconnedâ€ her out of her insurance money.Â  Extrinsic\r\n  circumstances included Allisonâ€™s intent to discredit Parrish by many references\r\n  to her alleged dishonesty including the statement that she was a liar.Â  The\r\n  words spoken are actionable if they\r\n  convey to the minds of the listeners, and would naturally be understood to\r\n  mean, the plaintiff has committed a crime.Â  Id. at 377, 6 S.E.2d at 752. Â Any words actually or impliedly stating the plaintiffâ€™s guilt, or\r\n  raising a strong suspicion of it in the minds of the hearers, are sufficient.Â  Porter\r\n    v. News &amp; Courier Co.,&nbsp;237 S.C.\r\n  102, 108, 115 S.E.2d 656, 658&nbsp;(1960).Â  See Herring v.\r\n    Lawrence Warehouse Co., 222 S.C. 226, 235, 72 S.E.2d 453, 455&nbsp;(1952)\r\n  (finding statement that an employee is â€œshort,â€ made during an audit and\r\n  coupled with immediate firing, actionable per se).Â   \r\nConsidering the\r\n  context in which Allisonâ€™s statements were made, I conclude the statement that\r\n  Parrish â€œconnedâ€ Allisonâ€™s mother out of her house and insurance money charged\r\n  Parrish with the commission of a crime of moral turpitude such as obtaining\r\n  property by false pretenses.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-240 (2003) (â€œA\r\n  person who by false pretense or representation . . . obtains from another\r\n  person any . . . money . . . or other property . . . is guilty of a: (1) felony\r\n  . . . if the value of the property is five thousand dollars or more .Â  . .\r\n  .â€).Â  Obtaining property under false pretenses is a crime of moral turpitude.Â  State\r\n    v.

no part of his trip was for a personal purpose.\r\nIn Arkansas, Hall worked closely with Charlie Brunner, a sales agent for Air Tech.Â  On July\r\n  16, 2004, Hall and his business associates scheduled a dinner meeting at the\r\n  Brunner home.Â  In attendance, in addition to Hall and Brunner, were John\r\n  Oliver, Air Tech owner, Charlotte Brunner, Air Tech sales associate, and Edward Osterman, Desert Aire regional sales manager.Â  Hall maintains the discussion\r\n  throughout the evening focused on Desert Aire sales, including long-term plans\r\n  and strategies for obtaining the Walmart account.Â  Hall and Brunner both\r\n  consumed alcohol before and during the dinner meeting.Â   \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hall\r\n  asserts the business discussion persisted after the meal ended.Â  He and Brunner\r\n  walked outside and around Brunnerâ€™s yard, â€œstill discussing things.â€Â \r\n  Eventually, they decided to change venue and continue talking while riding\r\n  around the block in Brunnerâ€™s jeep.Â  Brunner drove and Hall occupied the front\r\n  passenger seat.Â  Approximately 300 yards from Brunnerâ€™s home, the jeep\r\n  overturned and Hall sustained multiple injuries that required extended\r\n  hospitalization and medical treatment.Â  Brunner suffered fatal injuries. \r\n \r\nHall\r\n  sought workersâ€™ compensation benefits and Desert Aire denied his claim,\r\n  alleging Hallâ€™s injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his\r\n  employment.Â  The single commissioner found Hallâ€™s claim compensable, deciding\r\n  Hall had not deviated from the course and scope of his employment at the time\r\n  of his accident.Â  The single commissioner added: â€œ[e]ven if Hallâ€™s departure\r\n  from the Brunner home on the evening of the accident were a deviation from his\r\n  employment (which I find specifically was not the case) such a deviation was minimal\r\n  and did not remove Hall from continuing to act within the course and scope of\r\n  his employment at the time of the accident.â€Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel unanimously affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact\r\n  and conclusions of law, adopting the order in its entirety and incorporating it\r\n  by reference.Â  The circuit court affirmed the decision of the Appellate Panel,\r\n  with one exception.Â  The finding by the Appellate Panel that Hall suffered an\r\n  injury to his neck and left leg as a result of the compensable accident was\r\n  reversed.[1]Â   \r\nISSUE\r\nDoes\r\n  substantial evidence support the factual finding that Hallâ€™s injury arose out\r\n  of and in the course of his employment, concomitantly satisfying the legal\r\n  standard for compensability under section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  of Laws?\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes\r\n  the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission.Â  Lark v.

Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2006); Grant v.\r\n    Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007); Broughton\r\n      v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 496, 520 S.E.2d 634, 638 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â Â   \r\nThe\r\n  phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ refers to the injuryâ€™s origin and cause; whereas, â€œin\r\n  the course ofâ€ refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the\r\n  injury occurred. Â Baggott v. Southern Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 4, 496\r\n  S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998); Owings v.\r\n    Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 315\r\n  S.C. 297, 300, 433 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1993); Loges v. Mack Truck, Inc.,\r\n  308 S.C. 134, 138, 417 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1992).Â  Although the requirements are somewhat overlapping, they\r\n  are not synonymous and both must exist simultaneously to allow the claimant to\r\n  recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits. Â Osteen v. Greenville County School\r\n    Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 49, 508 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1998); Broughton, 336\r\n  S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 638. Â Â Â \r\nWhile an injury\r\n  must both arise out of and in the course of employment for an employee to\r\n  recover for an injury, â€œthere are circumstances when injuries arising out of\r\n  acts outside the scope of the employeeâ€™s regular duties may be compensable.Â \r\n  These circumstances have been applied to: (1) acts benefiting co-employees; (2)\r\n  acts benefiting customers or strangers; (3) acts benefiting the claimant; and\r\n  (4) acts benefiting the employer privately.â€Â  Grant, 372 S.C. 196, 202,\r\n  641 S.E.2d at 872.Â   \r\nWhether\r\n  an accident arises out of and is in the course and scope of employment is\r\n  largely a question of fact for the Appellate Panel. Â Pratt v. Morris\r\n    Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 518, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The\r\n  claimant has the burden of proving facts sufficient to allow recovery under the\r\n  Act.Â  West v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 252, 628 S.E.2d 279, 282\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  However, when the facts are undisputed, whether an accident\r\n  is compensable is a question of law.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C.\r\n  435, 622 S.E.2d 569 (Ct. App. 2005); Gibson, 338 S.C. at 518, 526 S.E.2d\r\n  at 729.Â   \r\nIn determining if\r\n  an accident arose out of and in the course of employment, each case must be\r\n  decided with reference to its own attendant circumstances.Â  Lanford v. Clinton Cotton Mills, 204 S.C. 423, 425, 30 S.E.2d 36, 41 (1944).Â  The general policy\r\n  in South Carolina is to construe the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in favor of\r\n  coverage, and any reasonable doubts as to construction should be resolved in\r\n  favor of the claimant.Â  Davis v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 289 S.C.\r\n  123, 125, 345 S.E2d 245, 246 (1986).  \r\nA.&nbsp; RaisonÂ  dâ€™etre mandated under section 42-1-160 for compensability.\r\nDesert Aire contends Hallâ€™s employment did not proximately cause his injuries because\r\n  the accident occurred during the jeep ride, while both Brunner and Hall were\r\n  intoxicated and incapable of meaningful business discussions.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn\r\n  accident arises out of employment when the employment is a contributing\r\n  proximate cause of the accident.Â  Simmons v. City of Charleston, 349\r\n  S.C. 64, 72, 562 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  It must be apparent to the\r\n  rational mind, considering all the circumstances, that a causal relationship\r\n  exists between the conditions under which the work is performed and the\r\n  resulting injury.Â  Smith v. NCCI, Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 253, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  268, 277 (Ct. App. 2006); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C.\r\n  488, 497, 520 S.E.2d 634, 638 (Ct. App. 1999).Â   \r\nâ€œ[I]f\r\n  the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and\r\n  to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole\r\n  situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the\r\n  employment, then it arises â€˜out ofâ€™ the employment.â€Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd.,\r\n  339 S.C. 173, 187, 528 S.E.2d 435, 442 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Douglas v.\r\n    Spartan Mills, Startex Div., 245 S.C. 265, 269, 140 S.E.2d 173, 175\r\n  (1965)).Â  The injury must be fairly traced to the employment as a contributing\r\n  proximate cause and cannot be the result of conditions to which the worker\r\n  would be equally exposed outside of the employment.Â  Id.Â   \r\n\r\n\tThe causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common\r\n  to the neighborhood. Â It must be incidental to the character of the business\r\n  and not independent of the relation of master and servant. Â It need not have\r\n  been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its\r\n  origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source\r\n  as a rational consequence.\r\n\r\nId. \r\nIn Gray,\r\n  339 S.C. at 173, 528 S.E.2d at 435, this court upheld the award of benefits to\r\n  an employeeâ€™s widow.Â  Gray died as a result of injuries he sustained in a motor\r\n  vehicle accident while traveling from his home to pick up items for delivery.Â \r\n  He was employed by Club Group to work at Harbour Town in Hilton Head.Â  Id. at 179, 528 S.E.2d at 438.Â  Grayâ€™s duties included greeting guests, delivering\r\n  documents, courier work, running errands, and transporting guests.Â  Id.Â  He was paid an hourly wage and normally worked Monday through Thursday, with\r\n  Friday off.Â  Id. at 185, 528 S.E.2d at 441.Â   \r\nA\r\n  co-owner of Club Group engaged Gray to transport payroll materials between Henderson and Harbor Town on his day off, using his own vehicle, for a $35 fee that\r\n  included mileage.Â  Id. at 179, 528 S.E.2d at 438.Â  The mileage was\r\n  calculated from Grayâ€™s home in Savannah to Henderson, then to Harbour Town, back to Henderson, and then to Grayâ€™s home.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  automobile accident occurred as Gray drove from his home in Savannah to Henderson to pick up payroll materials for his Friday job.Â  Club Group alleged his injury\r\n  did not arise out of Grayâ€™s employment.Â  We concluded:\r\n\r\n\tThere is substantial evidence in\r\n  the record to support a finding that Gray was required to pick up his\r\n  deliveries in the morning, and but for his employment he would not have\r\n  been traveling to Henderson.Â  Instead, he would have been traveling to Hilton\r\n  Head to pick up his paycheck, as was his custom prior to his employment on\r\n  Fridays.\r\n\r\nId. at 187, 528 S.E.2d at 443 (emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â  The essential function of Grayâ€™s Friday employment was travel.Â \r\n  Clearly, he could not accomplish his responsibilities but for his traveling.Â \r\n  Grayâ€™s employer specifically compensated him for his travel, based on round-trip\r\n  mileage from Grayâ€™s home.Â  Grayâ€™s employment was, therefore, the contributing\r\n  proximate cause of his death.\r\nIn West\r\n  v. Alliance Capital, Alliance challenged the award of benefits to an\r\n  injured worker who performed repairs on his own truck during working hours.Â  368\r\n  S.C. 246, 628 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Alliance asserted the workerâ€™s\r\n  activities were permissive rather than work-related.Â  Id.Â  Alliance employed West and leased his services to Meylan Enterprises.Â  Id. at 249,\r\n  628 S.E.2d at 281.Â  The custom and practice existed at Meylanâ€™s shops of\r\n  allowing employees, during working hours, to work on their own vehicles in the\r\n  shop, using shop equipment. Id. at 250, 628 S.E.2d at 281.Â  Because\r\n  Meylan lacked a sufficient number of usable vehicles, West volunteered the use\r\n  of his truck after it was restored to operable condition.Â  Id. Â at\r\n  252, 628 S.E.2d at 283.Â   \r\nWest\r\n  was engaged in activities related to his employment when he sustained his\r\n  injury. Â Meylan intended to use Westâ€™s truck following its repairs to address\r\n  its shortage of available vehicles.Â  Id. Â Meylan authorized West to travel\r\n  on company time and at company expense to retrieve the truck and permitted the\r\n  truck to be kept at the shop.Â  Id. at 253, 628 S.E.2d at 283.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Meylan understood repairs were necessary to make the truck operational.Â  Id. Affirming the award of benefits, we reasoned that â€œWestâ€™s injury arose out of\r\n  the employment because the truck was being repaired for Meylanâ€™s benefit, using\r\n  company resources, with Meylanâ€™s consent.Â  We conclude the record establishes\r\n  the requisite causal connection between the working conditions and the injury.â€Â  Id.\r\nOur\r\n  supreme court recently reversed the denial of workersâ€™ compensation benefits in Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 872 (2007).Â \r\n  Grant was vice-president of a family-owned business, Grant Textiles.Â  Id. at 198, 641 S.E.2d at 870.Â  After making a business delivery, Grant drove, in a\r\n  company-owned truck, to Clinton House and Meeting Plantation, a corporate\r\n  hunting preserve where Grant Textiles frequently entertained clients.Â  Id. at 198-99, 641 S.E.2d at 870.Â  Grant intended to meet his father, the CEO of\r\n  Grant Textiles, and customers who were interested in purchasing equipment from\r\n  the company.Â  Id.\r\nAs\r\n  Grant neared the entrance to the reserve, he swerved onto the shoulder to avoid\r\n  hitting an object in the highway. Id. He parked at the entrance to\r\n  Clinton House and walked back to the highway to remove the debris he believed\r\n  was a hazard to his potential customers and the general public. Â Id.Â  A moving vehicle hit Grant and injured him.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner awarded benefits and the Appellate Panel reversed,\r\n  concluding â€œ(1) the accident did not arise out of Claimantâ€™s employment because\r\n  the causative element of his accident had no connection with his employment;\r\n  and (2) that Claimantâ€™s job duties were in no way related to road\r\n  maintenance.â€Â  Id. at 200, 641 S.E.2d at 871.Â  The circuit court\r\n  reversed, declaring the Appellate Panel erred in its application of the law.Â  Id. The Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed and reinstated the decision of the Appellate Panel, holding\r\n  Grantâ€™s injuries did not arise out of his employment with Grant Textiles\r\n  because the cause of the accident had no relation to his regular employment\r\n  duties.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  supreme court held the Appellate Panel erred in finding no causal connection\r\n  between Grantâ€™s accident and his employment.Â  The accident would not have\r\n  happened but for Grantâ€™s business trip to the Clinton House to meet his\r\n  father and his employerâ€™s customers.Â  Id. at 202, 641 S.E.2d at 872\r\n  (emphasis supplied).Â  Grantâ€™s business trip and the duties incidental to it\r\n  were an integral part of his responsibility as an employee of Grant Textiles.\r\nContrastively,\r\n  this court reversed the award of benefits to an employee who was injured when\r\n  she left work to check on a sick co-worker.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 488,\r\n  520 S.E.2d at 634.Â  Upon reporting for her shift as a Kardex clerk, Broughton\r\n  read an unaddressed note left by a co-worker indicating she was sick and wanted\r\n  someone to check on her.Â  Id.Â  at 493, 520 S.E.2d at 636.Â  Broughtonâ€™s\r\n  supervisors were absent, and Broughton did not exercise a supervisory role over\r\n  any other employees. Â Id.Â  Moreover, her duties never required her to\r\n  leave her employerâ€™s premises.Â  Id.\r\nWithout\r\n  clocking out, Broughton decided to leave the workplace and check on the sick\r\n  co-worker, where she fell and sustained an injury. Id.Â  at 494, 520\r\n  S.E.2d at 637.Â  We held:Â   \r\n\r\n\tThere is simply no causal connection between Broughtonâ€™s employment\r\n  and her injury.Â  Her employment as a Kardex clerk in no way required her to\r\n  check on sick employees.Â  The accident was not related to the performance of\r\n  any duties as an employee by Broughton.Â  Checking on sick co-workers is not a\r\n  job requirement of Kardex clerks. \r\n\r\nId.Â  at 497-98, 520 S.E.2d at 638; see\r\n  also Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 50, 508\r\n  S.E.2d 21, 25 (1998) (holding no causal connection existed between an\r\n  attendance clerkâ€™s employment and her injury; â€œher employment in no way\r\n  required her to be placing a chest full of ice, for use over the weekend, into\r\n  the trunk of her vehicleâ€).Â   \r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, the Appellate Panel found Hallâ€™s credible testimony indicated the\r\n  eveningâ€™s activities were consistent with and logically related to Hallâ€™s\r\n  employment responsibilities.Â  Like the claimants in Gray and Grant,\r\n  Hallâ€™s purpose in traveling was wholly and exclusively in pursuit of his duties\r\n  as national sales manager for Desert Aire.Â  Nothing in the evidentiary record\r\n  suggests he engaged in any activities of a personal nature that might break the\r\n  causal link between his employment and his injuries.Â  Only business associates\r\n  attended the gathering at the Brunner home and their conversation focused on\r\n  plans and strategies to promote the sale of Desert Aire equipment.Â  Although\r\n  the business dinner ended at approximately 9:00 p.m., Hall and Brunner\r\n  continued discussing their marketing plans for Desert Aire as they walked\r\n  around the yard and eventually decided to take a drive in Brunnerâ€™s jeep.Â \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  custom and practice of Desert Aire employees was to frequently conduct the\r\n  companyâ€™s business in the context of entertaining.Â  Desert Aire provided Hall\r\n  with an expense account specifically for that purpose, understanding a portion\r\n  of the funds would be spent on alcohol.Â  As part of the culture of Hallâ€™s\r\n  company and â€œbusiness in general,â€ alcohol was served and consumed before and\r\n  during the dinner meeting on the night of the accident.Â  Desert Aire, like\r\n  Meylan in West, benefited from the business customs and practices\r\n  endorsed by the employer.Â  Here, the custom and practice of conducting business\r\n  in an entertaining environment fostered good working relationships, facilitated\r\n  planning, and furthered Desert Aireâ€™s interests.Â   \r\nDesert Aireâ€™s assertion that alcohol rendered Hall incapable of discussing business is\r\n  without substantial evidentiary support.Â  Hallâ€™s blood alcohol level several\r\n  hours following the accident was .121 percent and Brunnerâ€™s was .234 percent.Â \r\n  Desert Aireâ€™s expert, Dr. Roger A. Russell, opined that Brunner and Hall could\r\n  not have had meaningful business conversation at the time of the accident due,\r\n  in part, to intoxication.Â  Hallâ€™s expert, Dr. Robert Bennett, reported that\r\n  meaningful business conversation requires only cognitive functioning and does\r\n  not require motor skills.Â  Bennett submitted empirical data indicating that 50%\r\n  of individuals are not grossly intoxicated at a blood alcohol level of .15.Â  In\r\n  addition, he indicated that alcohol may, in fact, result in a beneficial effect\r\n  on cognitive function.  \r\nIn\r\n  deciding whether substantial evidence exists, it is appropriate to consider\r\n  both lay and expert evidence.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C.\r\n  276, 296, 599 S.E.2d 604, 614 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Sharpe v. Case\r\n    Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999)).Â  Adopting the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s finding, the Appellate Panel placed greater weight on Dr.\r\n  Bennettâ€™s opinion and report and Hallâ€™s credible testimony regarding the\r\n  content of the discussions with Brunner at the time of the accident.  \r\n\r\n\tOne of the bases of Dr. Russellâ€™s opinions with regard to the\r\n  level of intoxication of Hall assumed Hall was of the same height and weight as\r\n  Mr. Charles Brunner.Â  Hallâ€™s testimony clearly established that Mr. Brunner was\r\n  significantly taller and over 50 pounds heavier than Hall.Â  Dr. Russellâ€™s\r\n  opinions also assume Hall consumed as much alcohol as Mr. Brunner; however,\r\n  there is no evidence supporting this assumption.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel concluded Hall did not consume sufficient alcohol to render him\r\n  unable to engage in business discussions with Brunner immediately prior to the\r\n  accident.Â  Furthermore, Desert Aireâ€™s contention that Brunnerâ€™s alleged\r\n  intoxication proximately caused the accident is speculative.Â  The record is\r\n  devoid of any evidence establishing why Brunnerâ€™s jeep overturned.\r\nHall\r\n  was engaged in ongoing discussions with business associates involving the\r\n  marketing and sale of Desert Aire equipment at the time of the accident.Â  But\r\n    for these employment activities, Hall would not have traveled to Little Rock, attended the business dinner at the Brunner home, or continued his business\r\n  conversation with Brunner on into the evening.Â  At all times during the day and\r\n  evening Hall was executing his duties and responsibilities as national sales\r\n  manager for Desert Aire.Â  Moreover, consuming alcohol at employer-sponsored\r\n  functions was part of the custom and practice of the business culture, and\r\n  Hallâ€™s job exposed him to the hazards incidental to that custom and practice.Â \r\n  The Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Hallâ€™s injuries arose out of his employment\r\n  is not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  The record contains substantial\r\n  evidence from which reasonable minds could conclude that Hallâ€™s employment was\r\n  a contributing proximate cause of his accident and his resulting injuries arose\r\n  out of his employment with Desert Aire.\r\nB.&nbsp; The\r\n  course of employment prong of section 42-1-160.\r\nAn\r\n  injury occurs â€œin the course ofâ€ employment when it occurs within the period of\r\n  employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance\r\n  of his duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something\r\n  incidental thereto. Â Baggott v. Southern Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 5, 496\r\n  S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (citing Beam v. State Workmenâ€™s Compensation Fund,\r\n  261 S.C. 327, 331, 200 S.E.2d 83, 85 (1973); Gibson v. Spartanburg School\r\n    Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 519, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729-30 (Ct. App. 2000); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 499, 520 S.E.2d 634, 639 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â  An employee need not\r\n  be in the actual performance of the duties for which he was expressly employed\r\n  in order for his injury to be â€œin the course ofâ€ employment.Â  Grant v. Grant\r\n    Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007); Skipper v.\r\n      Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel.

Keller, 263 N.E.2d 231, 233 (Ohio 1970)).Â  â€œAn act outside\r\n  an employeeâ€™s regular duties which is undertaken in good faith to advance the\r\n  employerâ€™s interest, whether or not the employeeâ€™s own assigned work is thereby\r\n  furthered, is within the course of employment.â€ Â Grant, 372 S.C. at 202,\r\n  641 S.E.2d at 871-72 (citing Howell v. Kash &amp; Karry, 264 S.C. 298,\r\n  301, 214 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1975)).Â   \r\nIt is\r\n  well settled that â€œtraveling employees are generally within the course of their\r\n  employment from the time they leave home on a business trip until they return,\r\n  for the self-evident reason that the traveling itself is a large part of the\r\n  job.â€Â  Arthur Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workerâ€™ Compensation Law, Â§ 14.01\r\n  (Lexis-Nexis 2004).Â  However, this general rule is subject to challenge when an\r\n  injury occurs while the employee has deviated from his business route or\r\n  purpose.Â  See Meritt v. Smith, 269 S.C. 301, 307, 237 S.E.2d 366,\r\n  369 (1977) (noting â€œthe trip to and from an eating establishment, as well as\r\n  the taking of meals themselves, while on out-of-town business are within the\r\n  course and scope of employment unless the circumstances attending the taking of\r\n  the meal constitutes [sic] a deviationâ€).Â  Resolving this type of\r\n  compensability issue usually hinges on whether the injury occurred during a\r\n  â€œslightâ€ or â€œsubstantialâ€ deviation.  \r\nDesert Aireâ€™s characterization of Hall and Brunnerâ€™s drive as a â€œdrunken joy rideâ€\r\n  implies Hall substantially deviated from his business purpose of promoting\r\n  Desert Aire sales.Â  In support of this contention, Desert Aire relies on Brownlee\r\n    v. Wetterau Food Servs., 288 S.C. 82, 329 S.E.2d 694 (Ct. App. 1986); Boykin\r\n      v. Prioleau, 255 S.C. 437, 179 S.E.2d 599 (1971); and Grice v. National\r\n        Cash Register Co., 250 S.C. 1, 156 S.E.2d 321 (1967).Â Â   \r\nIn Brownlee,\r\n  an employee died of injuries received while out of state at a training\r\n  seminar.Â  288 S.C. at 83, 329 S.E.2d at 695.Â  This court affirmed the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s finding that the employee was not in the course of his employment at\r\n  time of death.Â  Id.Â  The training seminar began each day at 7:00 in the\r\n  morning and ended at approximately 10:00 in the evening.Â  Id. at 84, 329\r\n  S.E.2d at 695.Â  Employees attending the seminar stayed at the motel where it\r\n  was presented.Â  Id.Â  The fatal accident occurred at 1:55 a.m., several\r\n  hours after the last scheduled seminar event and at some distance from the\r\n  motel where the attendees stayed. Â Id.Â  The evidence indicated the employee, along with three other\r\n  seminar attendees, had planned to see a movie after the seminar events.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  affirming the denial of benefits, we determined the record lacked any evidence\r\n  the employee died while attending either a job-related function or\r\n  employer-sponsored event.Â  Id. at 85, 329 S.E.2d at 695.Â  Instead, substantial\r\n  evidence showed he â€œdied while engaged in an outing that occurred after work,\r\n  away from the premises of his employer, and at a time when his employer\r\n  exercised no control over his activities.â€Â  Id.Â Â   \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in Grice, the Appellate Panel denied benefits when an employee, who was\r\n  out of town for training, was killed while returning from a July fourth holiday\r\n  picnic with other employees.Â  250 S.C. 1, 156 S.E.2d 321.Â  The evidence failed\r\n  to demonstrate the employee sustained his injury in the course of his\r\n  employment.Â  Id.Â  Co-employees, without the knowledge or endorsement of\r\n  the employer, organized the picnic.Â  Id. at 4, 156 S.E.2d at 323.Â \r\n  Moreover, it was not held during regular work hours.Â  Id.Â  In affirming\r\n  the denial of benefits, our supreme court summarized:  \r\n\r\n\tThere is a total absence of any testimony tending to show that the\r\n  accident from which deceased sustained the fatal injuries had its origin in a\r\n  risk created by the necessity of being away from home. Â The picnic was not\r\n  arranged, sponsored, or suggested by the employer. Â It was solely an outing\r\n  planned by the deceased and his co-employees, taking place after work hours,\r\n  off the premises of the employer, and during hours when the employer exercised\r\n  no control over the employeeâ€™s activities. Â Insofar as the record discloses,\r\n  the employer had no knowledge of the picnic.Â  The attendance of the deceased\r\n  was purely voluntary on his part.\r\n\r\nId. at 5,\r\n  156 S.E.2d at 323.Â   \r\nBoykin\r\n  v. Prioleau involved a wrongful death action against a deceased defendant\r\n  whose duties required transporting younger co-employees, including Boykin, to\r\n  their homes after work.Â  255 S.C. 437, 179 S.E.2d 599 (1971).Â  On the evening\r\n  of the fatal accident, the defendant departed from his usual route and took the\r\n  co-employees on a three-hour â€œjoy rideâ€ that included several stops and\r\n  consumption of intoxicants.Â  All but one of the employees died in the\r\n  accident.Â  The issue at trial was whether the accident occurred during a\r\n  substantial deviation from the route delivering the employees home, or whether\r\n  the defendant had resumed the scope and course of his employment at the time of\r\n  the fatal accident.Â  If the defendant had returned to the course of his\r\n  employment, workersâ€™ compensation was the exclusive remedy and the wrongful\r\n  death action was barred.Â  The supreme court held this question was one for the\r\n  jury and reversed the trial courtâ€™s directed verdict in the defendantâ€™s favor. \r\n \r\nTangentially,\r\n  the court noted the workersâ€™ compensation hearing commissioner awarded death\r\n  benefits to Boykinâ€™s survivors.Â  The claim was settled without admission of\r\n  liability before appeal to the Appellate Panel was heard.Â  However, the court\r\n  did opine that a substantial deviation occurred during the drive to the\r\n  employeesâ€™ homes:  \r\n\r\n\tThe only reasonable inference from the facts which have been\r\n  stated is that almost immediately upon driving away from his employerâ€™s place\r\n  of business, [defendant] forsook the task assigned to him and embarked upon the\r\n  pursuit of his own ends.Â  It is abundantly clear that while thus engaged\r\n  [defendant] was not conducting his employerâ€™s business within the meaning of\r\n  the statute.Â  Whether upon leaving the restaurant, several miles from the point\r\n  of deviation, and starting back toward Columbia [defendant] resumed the scope\r\n  and course of his employment was, at best from defendantâ€™s standpoint, a jury\r\n  issue. Â We decide only that the court erred in resolving this issue in\r\n  defendantâ€™s favor as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nHall\r\n  cites Beam v. State Workmenâ€™s Compensation Fund, 261 S.C. 327, 200\r\n  S.E.2d 83 (1973) in support of his contention that his injury occurred in the\r\n  course of employment.Â  In Beam, two teachers were killed in an\r\n  automobile accident en route from Gaffney to Columbia to attend a South\r\n  Carolina Education Association meeting.Â  Beam, 261 S.C. at 330, 200\r\n  S.E.2d at 85.Â  The Appellate Panel awarded workersâ€™ compensation benefits,\r\n  finding the teachersâ€™ deaths arose out of and in the course of their\r\n  employment.Â  Id.Â  Our supreme court affirmed, adopting the principle\r\n  established by the Ohio Supreme Court that in order for injury or death to be\r\n  in the â€˜course of employmentâ€™ â€œit is sufficient if the employee is engaged in a\r\n  pursuit or undertaking consistent with his contract of hire and which in some\r\n  logical manner pertains to or is incidental to his employment.â€Â  Id. at 332, 200 S.E.2d at 86 (quoting Kohlmayer v. Keller, 24 263 N.E.2d 231,\r\n  233 (Ohio 1970)).Â  The evidence indicated the teachersâ€™ attendance at the\r\n  association meeting, while not compulsory, was encouraged, and expected as part\r\n  of their contractual obligation to participate in and attend the meetings of\r\n  professional organizations, including those of the South Carolina Education\r\n  Association.Â  Id. at 331, 200 S.E.2d at 85.Â  Concluding the teachers\r\n  died in the course of their employment, the court observed â€œthey were not\r\n  exercising a personal privilege wholly apart from their employment or their\r\n  employerâ€™s interest, but were about the performance of an act, incidental to\r\n  and recognized as of value by their superintendent in connection with their\r\n  duties as high school teachers.â€Â  Id. at 333, 200 S.E.2d at 86.\r\nWe deem Brownlee, Boykin, and Grice factually and legally\r\n  distinguishable from the instant case.Â  Though the claimants in Brownlee and Grice were out of town on business travel, their injuries did not\r\n  result from risks created by the necessity of being away from home.Â  The events\r\n  that led to each of the fatal accidents originated independently of any\r\n  employeeâ€™s effort to further the interests of his employer.Â  Griceâ€™s attendance\r\n  at a holiday picnic, Brownleeâ€™s assumed movie excursion, and the â€œjoy rideâ€\r\n  that led to Boykinâ€™s demise, were not within periods of employment.Â  Nor did\r\n  these claimantsâ€™ activities take place at locations where they might reasonably\r\n  perform their duties, at a time during which they fulfilled those duties, or while\r\n  engaged in something incidental thereto.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  contraposition, the Appellate Panel found Hallâ€™s exclusive purpose for his trip\r\n  to Little Rock was to represent and advance Desert Aireâ€™s interests.Â  The\r\n  nature of Hallâ€™s employment required extensive travel.Â  His duties were\r\n  necessarily performed in a variety of settings and during the course of an\r\n  entire day, rather than at a time and in a location designated by his\r\n  employer.Â  Desert Aire financially supported the custom and practice of\r\n  entertaining sales agents, engineers, and potential customers to promote sales\r\n  of Desert Aire equipment.Â   \r\nPellucidly,\r\n  the evidentiary record exuberates that Hall was engaged in ongoing discussions\r\n  regarding planning for sales activities on behalf of Desert Aire at the time of\r\n  the accident.Â  The accident occurred within the period of employment, at a\r\n  place where Hall was reasonably in the performance of his duties and was\r\n  fulfilling those duties or engaged in activities incidental to that\r\n  employment.Â  Like the claimants in Beam, Hall was not exercising a\r\n  personal privilege wholly apart from Desert Aireâ€™s interests.Â  Rather, Hallâ€™s\r\n  ongoing business discussion with Brunner was an act, incidental to and\r\n  recognized as beneficial by Desert Aire in connection with Hallâ€™s duties as national\r\n  sales manager.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  substantial evidence supports the factual finding that Hallâ€™s injury arose out\r\n  of and in the course of employment with Desert Aire, illatively satisfying the\r\n  legal standard for compensability under section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code of Laws.Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The record indicates Hall conceded no\r\n  compensable injuries were sustained to his neck or left leg.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4325","title":"Dixie Bell v.

Green (collectively Triple\r\n  Crownâ€™s principals), and Triple Crown Land Development, LLC (Triple Crown). Â The\r\n  jury awarded Dixie Belle $100,000, and the trial court granted Dixie Belleâ€™s\r\n  post-trial motion for pre-judgment interest.Â  We reverse the award of\r\n  pre-judgment interest.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn\r\n  June 1999, Larry C. Redd and Larry Clifton Redd organized Triple Crown Land\r\n  Development, LLC to buy and develop a tract of land in Aiken County, South Carolina.Â  Dixie Belle became an investor in Triple Crown, contributing $950,000 ($400,000\r\n  cash and a $550,000 loan from Grand South Bank, secured by Dixie Belleâ€™s\r\n  assets).\r\nDixie\r\n  Belle sent Triple Crown and its principals a letter in September 2001 to\r\n  commence negotiations to sell its interest in Triple Crown for $1,407,041.47.Â  Triple\r\n  Crown and its principals did not respond to the letter until June 2002, when Larry\r\n  C. Redd sought out James Forrest (Forrest), Dixie Belleâ€™s sole shareholder, to\r\n  discuss purchasing Dixie Belleâ€™s interest in Triple Crown.Â   \r\nForrest\r\n  testified he offered to sell Dixie Belleâ€™s interest for $1,412,000, the price\r\n  in the initial letter plus interest from September to June.Â  During his cross-examination,\r\n  Forrest explained how he reached the figure:Â  â€œYou take all those four things,\r\n  Grand South, my money, the interest on my money, the interest on the Grand\r\n  South note and you add ten percent to that and thatâ€™s all I wanted.â€\r\nLarry\r\n  C. Redd, on direct examination, asserted he and Forrest never formed an\r\n  agreement in June 2002.Â  When asked if Forrest ever stated a price, Larry C.\r\n  Redd answered:\r\n\r\n\tNo, he\r\n  didnâ€™t.Â  He said let him think over it, let him get back with us and he would\r\n  get back and let us know something.Â  We didnâ€™t go back down there, my\r\n  accountant what was with me, we didnâ€™t got back down there for a month or so.Â \r\n  He said, â€œI will fax you all something tomorrow,â€ but he did not do that, he\r\n  did not do what he said he would do.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  August 1, 2002, Triple Crown refinanced its property with Pacific Coast\r\n  Investments (Pacific), borrowing $5,720,000.Â  Forrest was not present at the\r\n  closing.Â  A portion of the Pacific loan was used to satisfy Dixie Belleâ€™s debt\r\n  with Grand South Bank in the amount of $630,559.67.Â  Both parties concede part\r\n  of the purchase price for Dixie Belleâ€™s interest in Triple Crown would be the\r\n  balance of the Grand South Bank loan.Â  On August 12, 2002, Dixie Belleâ€™s\r\n  attorney was given a $527,653 check for what Triple Crown and its principals\r\n  believed to be the remainder of Dixie Belleâ€™s interest in Triple Crown.\r\nDixie\r\n  Belle declares the balance of the amount due was $782,093.33, which was $254,440.33\r\n  more than Triple Crown and its principals tendered.Â  When a resolution could\r\n  not be reached, Dixie Belle sued Triple Crown and its principals on March 17,\r\n  2003, alleging four causes of action:Â  (1) declaratory judgment to determine if\r\n  Dixie Belle had a superior lien to Pacific Coast Investment Company; (2) an\r\n  order to allow Dixie Belle to negotiate the check for $527,653.00 without\r\n  prejudice to the claim the check did not represent full satisfaction of the\r\n  purchase price; (3) conversion; and (4) violation of South Carolina Uniform\r\n  Securities Act.\r\nThe parties\r\n  agreed to dismiss all original causes of action, and the trial court submitted\r\n  the dispute over the purchase price to the jury based on breach of contract and\r\n  breach of contract with fraudulent intent claims.Â  The jury returned a $100,000\r\n  verdict for Dixie Belle.Â  In a post-trial motion, Dixie Belle moved for pre-judgment\r\n  interest on September 20, 2005, arguing:Â   \r\n\r\n\tDefendants\r\n  agreed, as a matter of law, to pay Plaintiff One hundred thousand dollars\r\n  ($100,000.00) on August 1, 2002 and because the obligation to pay the One\r\n  hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) was by agreement demandable and the sum\r\n  was certain or capable of being reduced to certainty, Plaintiff is entitled to\r\n  pre-judgment interest through September 15, 2005.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  March 6, 2006, the trial judge granted Dixie Belle $27,352 in pre-judgment interest,\r\n  stating: â€œThe court finds and concludes that the obligation on which the\r\n  judgment was based was fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim\r\n  arose.â€\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tawarding pre-judgment interest to Dixie Belle?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid Dixie Bell establish the \r\n\t\t\tparties agreed to a sum certain, entitling it to pre-judgment \r\n\t\t\tinterest?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Historic Development of\r\n  Pre-Judgment Interest\r\nAn\r\n  excellent academic analysis of the historic development of the law involving\r\n  the concept and principle of pre-judgment interest is found in Vaughn\r\n    Development, Inc. v. Westvaco Development Corp., 372 S.C. 576, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  757 (Ct. App. 2007), which articulates:\r\n\r\n\tHistorically,\r\n  the recovery of prejudgment interest was severely limited.Â  Michael S. Knoll, \r\n\tA\r\n    Primer on Prejudgment Interest 75 Tex. L.Rev. 293, 294-98 (1996).Â  â€œThe\r\n  roots of prejudgment interest law are based on centuries-old moral and\r\n  religious proscriptions against interest and loans.Â  Both the ancient\r\n  Israelites and Greeks viewed the taking of any interest as usurious.â€Â  Martin\r\n  Oyos, Comment, Prejudgment Interest in South Dakota, 33 S.D. L.Rev. 484,\r\n  485-86 (1988).Â  With the shift from agrarian economies in the common law\r\n  European countries, and the emphasis in this country from the beginning on the\r\n  mercantile influence, prejudgment interest has become more favored and the\r\n  courts now allow prejudgment interest on liquidated amounts.Â  James L. Bernard,\r\n  Note, Prejudgment Interest and the Copyright Act of 1976 5 Fordham\r\n  Intell. Prop. Media &amp; Ent. L.J. 427, 433 (1995).Â  There has been, however,\r\n  â€œgrowing dissatisfaction with the distinction between liquidated and\r\n  unliquidated damages.Â  As a result, many jurisdictions abandoned itâ€¦.Â  With the\r\n  breakdown and rejection of the distinction between liquidated and unliquidated\r\n  damages, courts established more liberal rules for awarding prejudgment\r\n  interest.Â  Some courts looked to whether the claim was â€˜ascertainable.â€™â€Â  Id. at 434-436.Â  This liberalization of prejudgment law has even led to recovery of\r\n  prejudgment interest for personal injury damages, usually calculable from the\r\n  time of a settlement offer or demand.Â  See generally Diane M.\r\n  Allen, Annotation, Validity and Construction of State Statute or Rule\r\n    Allowing or Changing Rate of Prejudgment Interest in Tort Actions 40\r\n  A.L.R.4th 147 (1985) (cases and statutes cited therein).\r\n\tTurning\r\n  to South Carolina, we find an initial similar trend.Â  In the early part of the\r\n  last century in South Carolina, the law regarding prejudgment interest was\r\n  strict.Â  The failure of the party owing money to acknowledge a sum owed\r\n  prevented a plaintiff from recovering prejudgment interest; the amount due had\r\n  to be acknowledged and liquidated.Â  Wakefield v. Spoon, 100 S.C.\r\n  100, 106, 84 S.E. 418, 420 (1915).Â  However, even under this specific rule, the\r\n  law surrounding prejudgment interest was muddled.Â  Goddard v. Bulow 10\r\n  S.C.L. (1 Nott &amp; McC.) 45, 56 (1818) (â€œIt is not a little extraordinary\r\n  that a question of every dayâ€™s occurrence, should have remained to this time\r\n  unsettledâ€¦.â€).Â  Also similar to the trend in the United States, South Carolina liberalized the rules for awarding prejudgment interest.Â  The governing\r\n  statute looks to whether the claim is ascertainable.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 34-31-20(A) (Supp. 2006) (â€œIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases\r\n  wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall\r\n  draw interest according to lawâ€¦â€).Â  â€œIn South Carolina, interest may also be\r\n  awarded in equity cases, conversion cases, and property cases.â€Â  11 S.C. Juris.\r\n\tDamages Â§ 8 (1992).\r\n\r\nId. at 578-579, 642 S.E.2d at 758-759.\r\n2.&nbsp; Request for Pre-Judgment\r\n  Interest Must Be Pled\r\nTriple\r\n  Crown and its principals claim the trial court erred in awarding Dixie Belle\r\n  pre-judgment interest on the $100,000 jury verdict because Dixie Belle did not\r\n  request pre-judgment interest in its pleadings.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Town\r\n  of Bennettsville v. Bledsoe, 226 S.C. 214, 219, 84 S.E.2d 554, 556 (1954),\r\n  our Supreme Court held pre-judgment interest should not be included in the\r\n  judgment because it was not pled in the complaint or prayer.Â  Id.Â  Town\r\n    of Bennettsville involved a claim against a contractor to recover\r\n  overpayments made by the Town of Bennettsville on a construction contract.Â  The\r\n  Supreme Court reversed the trial court, holding:Â  â€œThe last contention of error\r\n  is that interest should not have been included in the judgment which was\r\n  rendered against [Bledsoe].Â  With this we agree because interest was not\r\n  demanded in the complaint or prayer.â€ Id. (citing Rawls v. American\r\n    Central Ins, Co., 97 S.C. 189, 204-205, 81 S.E. 505, 510 (1914)); accord Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 102, 529 S.E.2d 14, 18 (2000) (finding\r\n  pre-judgment interest must be pled absent an agreement to pay a sum certain); Hopkins\r\n    v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 307, 540 S.E.2d 454, 458 (2000); Chan v.\r\n      Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 293, 395 S.E.2d 731, 736 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œThe\r\n  Thompsons seek prejudgment interestâ€¦in their petition for rehearing.Â  The\r\n  Thompsons neither sought nor were awarded prejudgment interest in the lower\r\n  court.Â  They may not now raise this issue.â€).\r\nIn Goodson\r\n  v. Carolina Container Corp., Inc., 283 S.C. 575, 324 S.E.2d 67 (1984) pre-judgment\r\n  interest was denied when the claim demanding pre-judgment interest was stricken\r\n  from the record:Â  â€œInasmuch as it has agreed that Goodsonâ€™s attorney consented\r\n  to strike any reference to a claim for interest, the same should not have been\r\n  sought at the trial level.â€Â  Id. at 577, 324 S.E.2d 68.Â  The portion of\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s order granting pre-judgment interest was reversed, because\r\n  Goodson waived any claim to receive pre-judgment interest by not pleading it.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nAn\r\n  amendment to a complaint is sufficient to place the demand for pre-judgment\r\n  interest before the trial judge. Â Charleston County School Dist. v. Charleston County, 297 S.C. 300, 303, 376 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1989).Â  The motion to amend,\r\n  nevertheless, must be clear and specific to include a claim for pre-judgment\r\n  interest.Â  McMillan v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Agric., 364 S.C. 60, 611\r\n  S.E.2d 323 (Ct. App. 2005) cert. granted (Feb. 14, 2007).Â  In McMillan,\r\n  counsel moved to conform the pleadings to any evidence not originally pled.Â  Id. at 75, 611 S.E.2d at 331.Â  On appeal, this Court ruled the motion to amend the\r\n  pleadings was not sufficient to raise a pre-judgment interest claim:Â  â€œWe do\r\n  not find the motion made by Respondents was sufficient to properly amend the\r\n  complaint to include a claim for pre-judgment interest, which must be\r\n  specifically pled in order to be recovered.â€Â  Id.  \r\nIn Tilley\r\n  v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 375-376, 585 S.E.2d 292, 299 (2003), a\r\n  class action lawsuit for violation of the Consumer Protection Code, our Supreme\r\n  Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n\tBuyers\r\n  argue they are entitled to prejudgment interest from October 27, 1995, the date\r\n  the action was filed, to April 3, 1997, the date of entry of summary judgment.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\tThis\r\n  Court requires parties to plead for pre-judgment interest in order for it to be\r\n  recovered.Â  Hopkins v.

Congress of Racial Equality, 275 S.C. 556, 274 S.E.2d 287 (1981), our Supreme\r\n  Court declared:Â  â€œIn liquidated-damages cases, the amount is usually a sum\r\n  certain, or at least the amount is capable of ascertainment by computation.â€Â  \r\n\tId. at 560, 274 S.E.2d at 289.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines liquidated\r\n  damages as â€œ[a]n amount contractually stipulatedâ€ in contrast to unliquidated\r\n  damages which are â€œ[d]amages that â€¦ cannot be determined by a fixed formula, so\r\n  they are left to the discretion of the judge or jury.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law\r\n    Dictionary 395-97 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Liquidated damages â€œare\r\n  damages the amount of which has been made certain and fixed either by the act\r\n  and agreement of the parties or by operation of law to a sum which cannot be\r\n  changed by the proof.â€Â  22 Am.

App. 1994) advanced the principle that\r\n  pre-judgment interest is not automatically applied to judgments.Â  Id. at 399, 450 S.E.2d at 93.Â  This Court acknowledged the well-settled rule that\r\n  pre-judgment interest is appropriate where there is a sum certain, where\r\n  parties agree, or where the law provides the payment is demandable.Â  Id.Â  In T.W. Morton Builders, Inc., a home improvement contractor sued to\r\n  foreclose on a mechanicâ€™s lien, and the special master found poor business\r\n  practices on the part of both parties.Â  Id.Â  The Court concluded:\r\n\r\n\tT.W.\r\n  Mortonâ€™s success in proving the additional amount due for the renovations does\r\n  not automatically translate into entitlement to prejudgment interest on the\r\n  unpaid balance.Â  To establish its right to prejudgment interest, T.W. Morton\r\n  had the burden of establishing a stated account and the partiesâ€™ agreement,\r\n  express or implied, that the account is a true statement due at a specific\r\n  point.Â  The masterâ€™s implicit finding of no stated account is supported by the\r\n  testimony of Dr. von Buedingen, who vigorously disputed the amount due T.W.\r\n  Morton for cost overruns.Â  We accordingly affirm the denial of pre-judgment\r\n  interest.\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, the action arose when the parties failed to\r\n  reach an agreement on the purchase price of Dixie Belleâ€™s interest in Triple\r\n  Crown.Â  Dixie Belleâ€™s damages, however, were unliquidated, not entitling Dixie\r\n  Belle to pre-judgment interest.Â  The claim was unliquidated because:Â  (1) there\r\n  was no agreement between the parties as to a sum certain, (2) it could not be\r\n  reduced to a sum certain by computation or formula, (3) the purchase price was\r\n  not contractually stipulated, (4) it is not reduced to a sum certain by\r\n  operation of law or a controlling statute, and (5) it could only be reduced to\r\n  certainty by a jury determination.Â  Furthermore, the conditions existing at the\r\n  time the claim arose did not fix the measure of recovery.Â  Accordingly, Dixie\r\n  Belleâ€™s claim does not meet the statutory specifications of a sum certain, and Dixie\r\n  Belle is not permitted pre-judgment interest.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nDixie\r\n  Belle did not plead for pre-judgment interest, nor did its damages qualify\r\n  under the statute as liquidated or a sum certain.Â  The pre-judgment interest\r\n  awarded to Dixie Belle in the amount of $27,352 on the $100,000 jury verdict\r\n  was in error.Â  Therefore, we\r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4326","title":"Howard v.

Â The award did not reflect inclusion of\r\n  pain and suffering.Â  Howard moved for a new trial nisi additur, stating\r\n  the jury apparently ignored the law as it related to pain and suffering.Â  The\r\n  trial court took the matter under advisement and, in a form order, granted\r\n  Howard a new trial solely on the issue of damages based on the thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine.Â  In its subsequent written order the trial court ruled the juryâ€™s\r\n  findings regarding pain and suffering were â€œcontrary to the fair preponderance\r\n  of the evidence [and] . . . [t]he Plaintiff suffered obvious injuries which\r\n  obviously had to be painful.â€Â   \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in\r\n  directing a verdict in Howardâ€™s favor on the issue\r\n  of liability?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tgranting Howard a new trial on damages based\r\n  on the thirteenth juror doctrine?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict, this court will reverse if no evidence\r\n  supports the trial courtâ€™s decision or the ruling is controlled by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Law v.

Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006).Â  The appellate court must determine whether a verdict\r\n  for the party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts\r\n  as liberally construed in his or her favor.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369\r\n  S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006); Ericson v. Jones St. Publishers,\r\n    L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).Â  If the evidence as\r\n  a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is\r\n  created and the motion should be denied.Â  Proctor v.

Lockhart, 365 S.C. 178, 187, 617 S.E.2d 125, 129 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court\r\n  nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to\r\n  resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Wright v.

Â In considering a\r\n  motion for directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence and\r\n  inferences that can be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Doe v. ATC, Inc., 367 S.C. 199, 204, 624 S.E.2d 447, 449 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005); (citing Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d\r\n  231, 236 (2002)).Â  So long as no more than one inference is created from the\r\n  evidence presented, a jury issue is not created, and the trial court is proper\r\n  in directing a verdict.Â  Henson v. Intâ€™l Paper Co., 358 S.C. 133, 147, 594\r\n  S.E.2d 499, 506 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding where the evidence is susceptible of\r\n  more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the court may\r\n  not grant a directed verdict).Â Â Â   \r\nIn the case sub judice, Roberson and Lawhorn each owed a duty to other drivers and\r\n  passengers like Howard when operating their respective vehicles.Â  Pursuant to section\r\n  56-5-2150 of the South Carolina Code (2006), Lawhorn had a duty to turn his\r\n  vehicle safely and use the appropriate turn signal when making a left turn onto\r\n  a roadway.Â  Specifically, section 56-5-2150(a) provides, â€œNo person shall turn\r\n  a vehicle or move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement\r\n  can be made with reasonable safety nor without giving an appropriate signal as\r\n  provided for in this section.â€Â  Additionally, section 56-5-2150(b) mandates, â€œA\r\n  signal of intention to turn or move right or left when required shall be given\r\n  continuously during not less than the last one hundred feet traveled by the\r\n  vehicle before turning.â€ Â Accordingly, the law compelled Lawhorn to signal and\r\n  turn safely.Â Â   \r\nLikewise,\r\n  Roberson owed a duty pursuant to section 56-5-1880 of the South Carolina Code (2006) not to pass other vehicles within one hundred feet of\r\n  an intersection.Â  The trial court defined â€œintersectionâ€ as â€œ[t]he junction of\r\n  an unimproved road publicly maintained with a paved highway.â€Â  See Carma\r\n    v. Swindler, 228 S.C. 550, 557, 91 S.E.2d 254, 258 (1956); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-490 (2006).Â  Furthermore, â€œThe driver of a vehicle\r\n  overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the\r\n  left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of\r\n  the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-1840(1)\r\n  (2006).Â  South Carolina jurisprudence required Roberson to abide by these\r\n  statutes as he passed the van on the night of the accident. Â Finally, both Roberson\r\n  and Lawhorn were required to drive their automobiles at a safe and reasonable\r\n  speed under the conditions existing at the time of the accident.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 56-5-1520 (2006).Â  Whether Lawhorn and Roberson complied with these laws\r\n  created a question for the jury.\r\nIn\r\n  granting Howardâ€™s motion for a directed verdict, the trial court found either Roberson,\r\n  or Lawhorn, or both, breached at least one duty on the night of the accident.Â  The\r\n  effect of the courtâ€™s decision left the issue of who was liable open for determination\r\n  by the trier of fact.Â  The juryâ€™s task was to decide which driver, if not both,\r\n  was at fault and to calculate damages.  \r\nThe trial\r\n  court properly directed a verdict for Howard on the issue of liability.Â  The\r\n  evidence presented at trial yielded only one conclusionâ€”that the negligence of\r\n  at least one driver, if not both, resulted in the accident causing Howardâ€™s\r\n  injuries.Â  The trial court did not err in granting a directed verdict on the\r\n  issue of liability.Â   \r\nII.Â  Â New Trial on Issue of Damages  \r\nA.Â \r\n  Thirteenth Juror DoctrineÂ  \r\nRoberson\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting a new trial solely on the issue of\r\n  damages pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nThe following\r\n  excerpt from Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996) outlines South Carolina jurisprudential history concerning the thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine:  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  seminal case stating the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ doctrine is Worrell v. South\r\n    Carolina Power Co., 186 S.C. 306, 195 S.E. 638 (1938).Â  Worrell states:\r\n\tNor does\r\n  it follow that because under the law the trial judge is compelled to submit the\r\n  issues to the jury, he cannot grant a new trial absolute. Â As has often been\r\n  said, the trial judge is the thirteenth juror, possessing the veto power to the\r\n  Nth degree, and, it must be presumed, recognizes and appreciates his\r\n  responsibility, and exercises the discretion vested in him with fairness and\r\n  impartiality.Â  Worrell, 186 S.C. at 313-14, 195 S.E. at 641.\r\n\tA review of the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ doctrine\r\n  was undertaken by the appellate entity in Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251,\r\n  387 S.E.2d 265 (1990):\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThis\r\n  Court has had an opportunity to reconsider the thirteenth juror doctrine on\r\n  several occasions. Â Each time we have refused to abolish the doctrine. Â We have\r\n  also refused to require trial judges to explain the reasons for the ruling. Â The\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by which the trial court may grant a new\r\n  trial absolute when he finds that the evidence does not justify the verdict. Â This\r\n  ruling has also been termed granting a new trial upon the facts. Â The effect is\r\n  the same as if the jury failed to reach a verdict. Â The judge as the thirteenth\r\n  juror â€œhangsâ€ the jury. Â When a jury fails to reach a verdict, a new trial is\r\n  ordered. Â Neither judge nor the jury is required to give reasons for this\r\n  outcome. Â Similarly, because the result of the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ vote by the\r\n  judge is a new trial rather than an adjustment to the verdict, no purpose would\r\n  be served by requiring the trial judge to make factual findings.\r\n\t\tA trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will not be\r\n  disturbed unless his decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the\r\n  conclusion reached was controlled by an error of law. Â When an order granting a\r\n  new trial is before this Court, our review is limited to the consideration of\r\n  whether evidence exists to support the trial courtâ€™s order. \r\n\t\r\n\tFolkens, 300 S.C. at 254-55, 387 S.E.2d at 267 (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\n\tThe\r\n  trial judge, sitting as the thirteenth juror charged with the duty of seeing\r\n  that justice is done, has the authority to grant new trials when he is\r\n  convinced that a new trial is necessitated on the basis of the facts in the\r\n  case. Â Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984). Â Traditionally,\r\n  in South Carolina, circuit court judges have the authority to grant a new trial\r\n  upon the judgeâ€™s finding that justice has not prevailed. Â Todd v. Owen\r\n    Indus. Prods., Inc., 315 S.C. 34, 431 S.E.2d 596 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Similarly,\r\n  the judge may grant a new trial if the verdict is inconsistent and reflects the\r\n  juryâ€™s confusion. Â Johnson v. Parker, 279 S.C. 132, 303 S.E.2d 95\r\n  (1983). Â See also Johnson v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 317 S.C.\r\n  415, 453 S.E.2d 908 (Ct. App. 1995) (under â€œthirteenth juror doctrine,â€ trial\r\n  court may grant new trial if judge believes verdict is unsupported by evidence\r\n  and, similarly, new trial may be granted if verdict is inconsistent and\r\n  reflects juryâ€™s confusion). Â \r\n\r\n324 S.C. at 402, 477 S.E.2d\r\n  at 702.\r\nIn Norton\r\n  v. North S. Ry Co., 350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854 (2002), the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court explained, â€œthe thirteenth juror doctrine is so named because\r\n  it entitles a trial court to sit, in essence, as the thirteenth juror when [it]\r\n  finds â€˜the evidence does not justify the verdict,â€™ and then to grant a new\r\n  trial based solely â€˜upon the facts.â€™â€ (citing Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C.\r\n  251, 387 S.E.2d 265 (1990)).Â  The supreme court further held, â€œ[T]he result of\r\n  the â€˜thirteenth jurorâ€™ vote by the judge is a new trial rather than an\r\n  adjustment to the verdict . . . .â€Â  Norton, 350 S.C. at 478, 567 S.E.2d\r\n  at 854.Â  In essence, the judge, as the thirteenth juror, can hang the jury and\r\n  start the trial anew.Â   \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court recently affirmed a court of appealsâ€™ decision upholding the grant\r\n  of a new trial absolute under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  Trivelas v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 551-52, 593 S.E.2d 504, 508 (2004).Â  The\r\n  supreme court reasoned the grant was warranted because justice was not served\r\n  by the juryâ€™s verdict, and the evidence did not justify the result.Â  Id. at 552, 593 S.E.2d at 508.Â  The Trivelas court held granting a new trial\r\n  under the thirteenth juror doctrine has the same effect as if the jury failed\r\n  to reach a verdict, and the trial court is not required to give reasons for\r\n  granting a new trial.Â  Id. at 553, 593 S.E.2d at 508 (citing Folkens,\r\n  300 S.C. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267).Â   \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  â€˜thirteenth jurorâ€™ doctrine is not used when the trial judge has found the\r\n  verdict was inadequate or unduly liberal and, therefore, is not a vehicle to\r\n  grant a new trial nisi additur.â€Â  Bailey v. Peacock, 318\r\n  S.C. 13, 14-15, 455 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1995); see also Pinckney\r\n    v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 311 S.C. 1, 4-5, 426 S.E.2d 327, 329 (Ct. App.\r\n  1992).Â   \r\nB.Â \r\n  New Trial Absolute and New Trial Nisi Additur\r\nA\r\n  trial court may grant a new trial absolute on the ground that the verdict is\r\n  excessive or inadequate. Â Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 447, 520\r\n  S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 1999) affâ€™d by 342 S.C. 47, 536 S.E.2d 663\r\n  (2000) (citing Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 404, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  Additionally, a new trial is warranted if the verdict is\r\n  inconsistent. Â See Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d\r\n  802 (1993). Â The juryâ€™s determination of damages, however, is entitled to\r\n  substantial deference. Â Id. Â The trial judge must grant a new trial\r\n  absolute if the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as\r\n  to shock the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the figure reached\r\n  was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruption or some\r\n  other improper motives. Â See Cock-n-Bull Steak House, Inc. v.\r\n    Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996); McCourt by\r\n      and Through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995); Allstate\r\n        Ins. Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 431 S.E.2d 557 (1993). Â The failure of\r\n  the trial judge to grant a new trial absolute in this situation amounts to an\r\n  abuse of discretion and on appeal this court will grant a new trial absolute.Â  Stevens,\r\n  336 S.C. at 452, 520 S.E.2d at 631.Â  Â \r\nAlternatively,\r\n  the trial court may grant a new trial nisi additur or remittitur when it finds the verdict is merely inadequate or excessive. Â Id. â€œ[T]he\r\n  trial judge must distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or\r\n  conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice or prejudice.â€Â  Id. (citing Allstate Ins. Co., 314 S.C. at 530, 431 S.E.2d at 558).Â  A new\r\n  trial nisi is one in which a new trial will be granted unless the party\r\n  opposing it complies with conditions set by the court. Â Elliott v. Black River Elec. Coop., 233 S.C. 233, 104 S.E.2d 357, 372 (1958).Â  â€œA motion for a new\r\n  trial nisi because of excessiveness of the verdict contemplates not the\r\n  striking down of the verdict in toto, but remission of part of it and the\r\n  granting of a new trial in default thereof.â€Â  Id.Â  The trial court essentially\r\n  gives the party against whom damages are assessed the option, by way of additur or remittitur, of avoiding a new trial.\r\nThe\r\n  granting of a motion for new trial nisi additur or remittitur rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, but substantial deference\r\n  must be afforded to the juryâ€™s determination of damages.Â  Green v. Fritz,\r\n  356 S.C. 566, 570, 590 S.E.2d 39, 41 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Compelling reasons must be given to justify invading\r\n  the juryâ€™s province in this manner. Â Chapman v. Upstate RV &amp; Marine,\r\n  364 S.C. 82, 89, 610 S.E.2d 852, 856 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Pelican Bldg.\r\n    Ctrs. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 61, 427 S.E.2d 673, 676 (1993)).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  summary, the court of appeals in Proctor v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, offers an explanation of this process in gargantuan detail:\r\n\r\n\tA new\r\n  trial nisi is one in which a new trial will be granted unless the party\r\n  opposing it complies with a condition set by the court.Â  The grant or denial of\r\n  new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge, and his\r\n  decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\n  of law.Â  The trial court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when he finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â \r\n  However, compelling reasons must be given to justify invading the juryâ€™s\r\n  province by granting a new trial nisi [additur or] remittitur.Â \r\n  The consideration for a motion for a new trial nisi [additur or]remittitur\r\n  requires the trial judge to consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of\r\n  the evidence presented.Â  Great deference is given to the trial judge who heard\r\n  the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial, and\r\n  who thus possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this Court.Â  When\r\n  considering a motion for a new trial based on the inadequacy or excessiveness\r\n  of the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court must distinguish between awards that are\r\n  merely unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion,\r\n  caprice, or prejudice.Â  If the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or\r\n  excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other\r\n  influence outside the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial\r\n  absolute.\r\n\r\n368 S.C. 279, 319-21, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 496, 518 (Ct. App. 2006) (internal citations and quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  Â Â \r\nC.Â \r\n  A Procedural Conundrum\r\nÂ We\r\n  address the equivocality extant in this record.Â  The only motion posited by\r\n  Howard was a motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â  The record\r\n  reveals this with certitude: Â \r\n\r\n\tOn\r\n  behalf of the Plaintiff, I would make a motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â \r\n  Obviously the jury gave a verdict for the exact amount of the medical expenses,\r\n  chiropractic expenses, and wage loss.Â  They obviously ignored your charge as to\r\n  pain and suffering.Â  If all the medical expenses and wage loss were justified,\r\n  then how can the pain and suffering which necessitated the medical expenses not\r\n  be compensable?Â  They ignored the law as it relates to pain and suffering\r\n  obviously.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court failed to rule on Howardâ€™s motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â \r\n  The circuit judge granted a new trial on damages alone based on the thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine.Â   \r\nOur precedent\r\n  firmly establishes the grant of a new trial based on the thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine grants a new trial in toto.Â  The thirteenth juror doctrine is not the\r\n  proper vehicle for ordering a new trial on a singular issue such as damages.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the trial court erred in granting a new trial solely on damages based on the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.Â   \r\nThough\r\n  Howard was entitled to a directed verdict in his favor on the issue of\r\n  liability, the directed verdict did not specifically hold Roberson liable to\r\n  Howard.Â  Moreover, Roberson did not appeal the juryâ€™s finding that Lawhorn was\r\n  not liable and Lawhorn was not made a party to this appeal.Â  The determination\r\n  that Lawhorn was not liable is now the law of the case.Â  First Union Natâ€™l\r\n    Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (â€œThe unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires\r\n  affirmance.â€)  \r\nConsequently, we\r\n  remand this case back to the trial court to rule on Howardâ€™s new trial nisi additur motion.Â  Roberson must comply with the trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  regarding additur to avoid a new trial as the sole defendant.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial\r\n  court properly granted Howardâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  However, the trial\r\n  court erred by granting a new trial on the issue of damages alone against\r\n  Roberson under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  Procedurally, the trial court\r\n  cannot use the doctrine as a vehicle to grant a plaintiff a new trial on the\r\n  issue of damages alone.Â  Instead, the trial court should have ruled on Howardâ€™s\r\n  motion for new trial nisi additur, and in its discretion, increased\r\n  damages for pain and suffering.Â  At that juncture, the opposing party must be\r\n  given the option to comply with the additur or be granted a new trial\r\n  absolute.Â  If the option utilized by the opposing party in contradistinction to\r\n  the nisi additur is a new trial absolute, then and in that event only,\r\n  the new trial absolute is against Roberson because Lawhorn has been eliminated\r\n  from this case as a matter of law.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4327","title":"State v.

Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor I.\r\n  McDuffie Stone, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  James\r\n  Odom appeals the circuit courtâ€™s determination that police had probable cause\r\n  to seize him in a traffic stop.Â  He further argues that because the stop was\r\n  illegal, the marijuana seized during the stop should have been suppressed.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 4, 2002, Odom was pulled over\r\n  by two officers who witnessed Odom driving a vehicle without wearing a\r\n  seatbelt.Â  Officer Carter, one of the two officers who witnessed the violation,\r\n  approached Odomâ€™s vehicle to explain to him why he had been pulled over.Â  As\r\n  Carter drew near to Odomâ€™s vehicle, he smelled a strong odor of marijuana and recognized\r\n  a Swisher-Sweet cigar[1] on the dashboard.Â  Carter asked Odom if he had smoked marijuana, and Odom admitted\r\n  he had done so earlier that same morning.Â  In addition, Carter noticed a\r\n  security guard belt with a gun holster in the rear passenger seat, although the\r\n  holster was empty at the time.Â  \r\nBelieving that a weapon could be present, Carter asked Odom to\r\n  exit the vehicle and thereafter conducted a Terry frisk.[2] Â Carter testified he felt a bundle of\r\n  leafy material in the breast pocket of Odomâ€™s jacket, which he immediately\r\n  recognized as marijuana because of the extensive training he had received on\r\n  the Drug Interdicton Force from the United States Department of Homeland\r\n  Security.Â  After finding the drugs, Carter placed Odom under arrest; continued\r\n  his search; and located a second larger bag, and two smaller bags of marijuana,\r\n  totaling 4.361 ounces.Â  \r\nOdom was indicted for possession of marijuana with the intent to\r\n  distribute.Â  At the start of the trial, Odomâ€™s counsel moved to suppress the\r\n  marijuana as a product of an illegal search and seizure.Â  The court overruled\r\n  this motion.Â  Following presentation of the stateâ€™s case, the court, sitting\r\n  non-jury, found Odom guilty and sentenced him to five yearsâ€™ confinement.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\n  the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error\r\n  of law. Â State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467\r\n  (2000).\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review\r\n  errors of law only.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498,\r\n  500&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings\r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 388, 577 S.E.2d at 500-01.Â \r\n  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in\r\n  determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Our review in\r\n  Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any\r\n  evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  State v. Bowman, 366 S.C.\r\n  485, 501, 623 S.E.2d 378, 386&nbsp;(2005).Â  An appellate court will reverse\r\n  only when there is clear error.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Existence of Probable\r\n  Cause for Initial Seizure\r\nOdom first asserts\r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the officers had probable cause to seize him\r\n  based on their limited opportunity to view whether he was wearing his seatbelt,\r\n  the distance between the vehicles, and the dark tint of Odomâ€™s windows.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nSection 56-5-6520 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) requires drivers or occupants to wear a\r\n  complying, fastened safety belt when the motor vehicle in which they are riding\r\n  is being operated on the public streets and highways of South Carolina.Â  A law\r\n  enforcement officer may pull over or stop a vehicle when the officer has probable\r\n  cause of a seatbelt violation based on a clear and unobstructed view of someone\r\n  within the vehicle who is not wearing a seatbelt.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-6540\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  Odomâ€™s counsel used a series of photos during his\r\n  cross-examination of the arresting officers in order to illustrate it would\r\n  have been impossible for the officers to recognize a seatbelt violation, during\r\n  similar circumstances.Â  However, both Officer Carter and his fellow patrolman\r\n  Officer Dansky, testified to clearly seeing Odom across an intersection from\r\n  where they were parked, operating a motor vehicle without wearing a safety\r\n  belt.Â  Because there is testimony in the record upon which the circuit court\r\n  could base its judgment, we cannot say the court abused its discretion in finding\r\n  the officers had probable cause to seize Odom due to his seatbelt violation.Â \r\nSee Bowman, 366 S.C. at 501, 623 S.E.2d at 386.\r\nII. Legality of Detainment\r\n  and Patdown\r\nOdom next asserts\r\n  the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of marijuana found on him during\r\n  the seizure.Â  Specifically, Odom contends the search violated the safety belt\r\n  legislation enacted by our legislature.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  56-5-6540(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides:Â  â€œA vehicle,\r\n  driver, or occupant in a vehicle must not be searched, nor may consent to\r\n  search be requested by a law enforcement officer, solely because of a violation\r\n  of this article.â€Â  Odom argues the alleged seatbelt violation was the only\r\n  cause for the subsequent search.Â  We find this argument is misguided.Â  As\r\n  discussed above, a seatbelt violation can be the sole basis for a police\r\n  officer to pull over a vehicle.Â  Section 56-5-6540(D) emphasizes this initial\r\n  seizure cannot be extended to a subsequent search without additional suspicion\r\n  rising to the level of probable cause.Â  In this case, Officer Carter smelled a\r\n  strong odor of marijuana as he approached Odomâ€™s car and noticed a common indicium of paraphernalia, a Swisher-Sweet cigar, on the dashboard.Â \r\n  Additionally, Odom admitted to smoking marijuana earlier in the day, and\r\n  Officer Carter observed an empty gun holster in the back seat.Â  Having cause to\r\n  fear for his own safety and reasonable suspicion of the existence of drugs,\r\n  Officer Carter asked Odom to exit the vehicle and conducted a Terry search.Â  \r\n\r\nIn Terry,\r\n  the United States Supreme Court announced that police may briefly detain and\r\n  conduct a reasonable search for weapons where the officer has reason to believe\r\n  the person is armed.Â  Terry, 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968).Â  Applying this concept,\r\n  the Supreme Court has also held once a vehicle has been lawfully detained for a\r\n  traffic violation, police officers may order the driver out of the vehicle and\r\n  conduct a search for weapons where the officer believes the person is armed and\r\n  dangerous.Â  Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 111-12 (1977).Â  â€œThe\r\n  officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue\r\n  is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in\r\n  the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.â€Â  Terry at\r\n  27.Â  The existence of the evidence described above gave Carter the reasonable\r\n  suspicion necessary to perform a patdown for weapons; therefore, Officer Carterâ€™s\r\n  search was not solely based on Odomâ€™s seatbelt violation.[3]Â Â  \r\nIII. â€œPlain-Feel Doctrineâ€\r\nFinally, Odom\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in admitting the marijuana because the video in\r\n  the police squad car allegedly shows a violation of the â€œplain-feelâ€ rule\r\n  annunciated in Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993). Â Odom argues\r\n  even if the initial traffic stop and Carterâ€™s decision to patdown Odom were\r\n  valid, the patdown exceeded the bounds established under Terry and\r\n  confirmed in Dickerson.Â  We disagree.\r\nBefore the start of\r\n  the trial, Odomâ€™s counsel made a motion to suppress the evidence gained from\r\n  the seizure and subsequent search.Â  In support of this motion, Odom played the\r\n  in-car video of Officer Carterâ€™s stop, which Odom argues provides evidence\r\n  Carterâ€™s frisk exceeded constitutional bounds.Â  In Dickerson, the\r\n  Supreme Court confronted for the first time the issue of a police officer who conducted\r\n  a patdown search pursuant to Terry which did not yield a weapon; however,\r\n  the officer recognized and seized nonthreatening contraband detected during the\r\n  patdown.Â  Dickerson at 369, 373.Â  Where the seizure remains within the\r\n  bounds of Terry, the Court reasoned:\r\n\r\n\tIf\r\n  a police officer lawfully pats down a suspectâ€™s outer clothing and feels an\r\n  object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has\r\n  been no invasion of the suspectâ€™s privacy beyond that already authorized by the\r\n  officerâ€™s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless\r\n  seizure would be justified by the\r\n  same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context.\r\n\r\nId. at 375-76.Â  However, the Court in Dickerson found the officer did not immediately recognize the incriminating character of\r\n  the object in the suspectâ€™s pocket.Â  Instead, it only became apparent after\r\n  â€œsqueezing, sliding and otherwise manipulating the contents of the defendantâ€™s\r\n  pocket â€“ a pocket which the officer already knew contained no weapon.â€Â  Id. at 378.\r\nWe find the case\r\n  before us is distinguishable from Dickerson, and more closely aligned\r\n  with our courtâ€™s decision in State v. Smith, 329 S.C. 550, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  798 (Ct. App. 1998) cert. denied.Â  In Smith, police pulled\r\n  a suspect over for speeding and, pursuant to a reasonable suspicion, asked the\r\n  suspect to exit the vehicle and thereafter conducted a Terry search.Â \r\n  The officer conducting the search testified he immediately recognized a bulge\r\n  in one of the suspectâ€™s pockets as a narcotic despite admitting he â€œsqueezed the\r\n  outside of [suspectâ€™s] jacketâ€ and â€œsqueezed around the package.â€Â  Smith at 560, 495 S.E.2d at 803.Â  This court distinguished \r\nDickerson,\r\n  explaining, â€œ[a]lthough there is testimony in the record [the police officer]\r\n  squeezed the outside of [suspectâ€™s] jacket, we do not find this sufficient to\r\n  invalidate the seizure under Dickerson.â€Â  Id.Â  Â \r\nAs in Smith,\r\n  during Odomâ€™s pre-trial suppression hearing, Carter testified he recognized immediately the bundle of\r\n  leafy material in the breast pocket of Odomâ€™s jacket as marijuana, testifying:Â \r\n  â€œOnce [Odom] steeped [sic] out of the vehicle I smelled a strong odor of\r\n  marijuana coming from his body, started the search and felt the large bundle in\r\n  his breast pocket then I knew what it was, it was a bag of marijuana.â€Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding\r\n  Carterâ€™s search stayed within the bounds of Terry, as clarified in Smith,\r\n  and allowing the fruits of that search to be admitted into evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court did not err: (1) in\r\n  finding probable cause to initially seize Odom due to a seatbelt violation; (2)\r\n  in admitting the marijuana seized during the search; or (3) in\r\n  determining the officerâ€™s patdown search did not extend past the â€œplain-feelâ€\r\n  rule allowed under Terry.Â  The decision of the circuit court is\r\n  accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Carter testified a Swisher-Sweet cigar is commonly\r\n  known as a â€œblunt,â€ which refers to a cigar that has been hollowed and refilled\r\n  with marijuana. The term â€œbluntâ€ was originally derived from the preferred\r\n  brand of cigars for this operation, Phillies Blunts, but can refer to any brand\r\n  of store-bought cigars.Â  See Urban Dictionary, available at http://www.urbandictionary.com.\r\n[2] Terry\r\n  v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).\r\n[3] Additionally, Odom contends this court should\r\n  analogize the â€œsolelyâ€ language of Section 56-5-6540(D) with the portion of the\r\n  criminal domestic violence (CDV) statute which limits the admissibility of\r\n  evidence found pursuant to a CDV complaint.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-70(H)\r\n  (Supp. 2006).Â  We find this argument unavailing.Â  Section 16-25-70(H) sets out\r\n  criteria which expressly forbids the admissibility of evidence gained as a\r\n  result of a complaint filed under the CDV statute, unless it falls under the\r\n  two given exceptions:Â  (1) if [the evidence] is found . . . in plain view . . .\r\n  [or] pursuant to a search incident to a lawful arrest . . . or (2) if it is\r\n  evidence of a violation of this article.Â  As decided above, the police officers\r\n  conducted a lawful Terry frisk and search of Odom for reasons other than\r\n  the seatbelt violation.Â  See State v. Cannon, 336 S.C.\r\n  335, 339, 520 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1999). Furthermore, there is no explicit statutory\r\n  exclusion language contained in Section 56-5-6540.Â  Therefore, we find this\r\n  argument is without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
