We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\n\r\n  FACTS\r\n  On or about July 25 \r\n    or 26, 2001, Officer Marvin Brown, an investigator with the multi-jurisdictional \r\n    Drug Enforcement Unit (DEU) of the Sixteenth Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office, received \r\n    information from Columbia Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Agent Richard Freeman \r\n    that Appellant Billy Jason Keith had a large quantity of marijuana at his \r\n    residence. Brown testified that he has known Freeman for several years and \r\n    he is â€œcomfortableâ€ with him. An unidentified informant gave Freeman the information \r\n    and it was specific as to Keithâ€™s name and address.\r\n  Also, during the same \r\n    period of time, two additional sources informed Officers Lubben and Parrish \r\n    that Keith had a quantity of drugs at his home. Brown saw the informants speaking \r\n    with Lubben and Parrish, but did not know the identity or reliability of the \r\n    informants. Additionally, within the month, Brown listened to a recorded telephone \r\n    call a confidential informant made from the police department to Keithâ€™s house \r\n    in which the informant spoke with a person believed to be Keithâ€™s mother about \r\n    a marijuana transaction. \r\n\r\n\r\nBased upon this information, Brown ordered \r\nan investigative surveillance of Keithâ€™s residence on Ebinport Road in Rock Hill, \r\nSouth Carolina. Officers McCarley, Lubben, and Graham conducted the surveillance \r\ndirectly across the street from Keithâ€™s home beginning shortly after 10:00 p.m. \r\non July 27, 2001. During the surveillance, officers observed an unidentified individual \r\napproach Keithâ€™s residence. The officers heard a knock and saw a light go on and \r\noff, but heard no response. The individual left the residence without entering \r\nand was intercepted by the officers when he crossed the street. McCarley testified \r\nthe individual told him he knew Keith and that Keithâ€™s residence â€œwas a place \r\nhe could get something to speed him up.â€ No drugs were found on the individual \r\nand his identity was not recorded. This information was communicated to Brown.\r\n\r\n  While questioning the individual, \r\n    officers observed a vehicle pull away from Keithâ€™s residence. The vehicle \r\n    was one Keith was known to drive. The officers immediately followed the vehicle \r\n    and stopped it for having an expired tag. Keith was driving the car and Heidi \r\n    Jones was located in the front passenger seat. Keith consented to a search \r\n    of the car. Officers found a distinctive marijuana bud in the ashtray and \r\n    a pipe containing marijuana residue in the glove box. Neither Keith nor Jones \r\n    admitted ownership of the bud or pipe, and both were arrested.\r\n  \r\nThe surveillance officers communicated \r\n  with Officer Brown about the discovery of marijuana in the vehicle after it \r\n  was seen leaving Keithâ€™s home. Brown prepared an affidavit and appeared before \r\n  a magistrate to obtain a warrant to search Keithâ€™s home. Brown also presented \r\n  detailed supplemental oral testimony to the magistrate under oath respecting \r\n  the surveillance of Keithâ€™s residence; the observations of and interview with \r\n  the unidentified individual at Keithâ€™s home; his long-term relationship with \r\n  Freeman; and the reports from unidentified informants conveyed to him by Freeman, \r\n  Lubben, and Parrish, as well as his own observations during the informantâ€™s \r\n  telephone conversation, all as related above.\r\nA search warrant was issued and officers \r\n  immediately executed the warrant. The search of Keithâ€™s residence yielded marijuana \r\n  buds similar to the marijuana found in Keithâ€™s vehicle; methamphetamine, cocaine, \r\n  and ketamine residue; and two digital scales.\r\n  In a pretrial suppression hearing, \r\n    Keith argued the illegal drug evidence seized from his home should have been \r\n    excluded because there was insufficient probable cause to issue the search \r\n    warrant. The court denied the motion to suppress, finding the totality of \r\n    the circumstances sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance \r\n    of the search warrant. Specifically, the trial court concluded the surveillance, \r\n    stop, and seizure of illegal drugs from Keithâ€™s car, viewed in context with \r\n    the other information provided to the magistrate in the affidavit and in oral \r\n    sworn testimony was sufficiently corroborative to establish reliability and \r\n    support a finding of probable cause. Keith renewed his objection to admission \r\n    of the evidence at trial, and the objection was overruled.\r\n  \r\nKeith was convicted on all charges \r\n  in a bench trial and was sentenced to two years incarceration and a $500 fine, \r\n  suspended to $300 and five years probation for possession of methamphetamine; \r\n  two years suspended to five years probation for possession of cocaine; and six \r\n  months suspended to five years probation for possession of ketamine. This appeal \r\n  follows.\r\n  ISSUE \r\n  \r\nWas the affidavit in support of the \r\n  search warrant sufficient to support probable cause to issue a search warrant \r\n  to search Keithâ€™s home for illegal drugs?\r\n  STANDARD OF \r\n    REVIEW\r\n  \r\n â€œ[T]he duty of a reviewing court \r\n  is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a â€˜substantial basisâ€™ for . . . \r\n  conclud[ing] that probable cause existed.â€ [2] Â  â€œThis review, like the determination \r\n  by the magistrate, is governed by the â€˜totality of the circumstancesâ€™ test.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  On review, great deference should be given to a magistrateâ€™s determination \r\n  of probable cause. [4] \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n \r\n  \r\n    \r\nOn appeal, Keith argues the search \r\n  warrant affidavit was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause because \r\n  it contained hearsay and conclusory statements and failed to establish informant \r\n  reliability.Â  He asserts the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence \r\n  seized as a result of the warrant. We disagree.Â \r\n&quot;A search warrant may issue \r\n  only upon a finding of probable cause.&quot;[5] &quot;This determination requires \r\n  the magistrate to make a practical, common-sense decision of whether, given \r\n  the totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the \r\n  veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying information, there is a \r\n  fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular \r\n  place.&quot;[6]\r\n  \r\n  The affidavit prepared by Brown provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The affiant, a sworn police officer \r\n    with several years narcotics investigations, has received information that \r\n    a Billy Jason Keith is using and selling marijuana at &amp; from his residence \r\n    at 2401 Ebinport Rd., Rock Hill, S.C.Â  This information was received within \r\n    the past 72 hours from DEA Agent Richard Freeman of Columbia, S.C.Â  Also, \r\n    within the past 72 hours, the DEU, Officer Lubben and Parrish received information \r\n    from two sources of Keith using and selling drugs from his residense [sic].Â  \r\n    Offices [sic] have personal knowledge of Keith &amp; his residence on Ebinport \r\n    Rd.Â  Furthermore, on this date, officers of the DEU conducting surveillance \r\n    at the residence observed Keith leave the residence &amp; approached Keith \r\n    after leaving &amp; lawfully recovered marijuana from Keithâ€™s 2000 Nissan. \r\n    \r\n\r\nWe find the portion of the \r\n        affidavit relating to the investigative surveillance, stop, and seizure \r\n        of illegal drugs from Keithâ€™s car standing alone sets forth sufficient \r\n        information to support a probable cause finding in this case.Â  InÂ  State \r\n        v. Scott, [7]  officers were surveilling Scottâ€™s residence when they observed \r\n        Scott leaving in his vehicle.Â  The officers immediately followed and stopped \r\n        the car to serve an outstanding warrant for Scottâ€™s arrest for distribution \r\n        of cocaine.Â  A search of Scottâ€™s car yielded in excess of 20 grams of \r\n        cocaine.Â  A search warrant for Scottâ€™s home was issued upon an affidavit \r\n        reflecting these facts. The affidavit also indicated law enforcement officers \r\n        maintained visual contact with Scott from the time he left his residence \r\n        until he was stopped.Â  Scott asserted the affidavit supporting the search \r\n        warrant failed to articulate sufficient probable cause. We determined \r\n        the affidavit articulated sufficient probable cause for the search warrant, \r\n        considering the totality of the circumstances outlined in the affidavit, \r\n        the nature of the evidence sought, and the type of offense involved. [8] Â  \r\n      \r\nSimilarly, we find the information \r\n  contained in Brownâ€™s affidavit relating the stop and seizure of illegal drugs \r\n  from Keithâ€™s car provided a sufficient basis for the determination of probable \r\n  cause under the totality of the circumstances, and it is not necessary to consider \r\n  Keithâ€™s argument concerning lack of informant reliability. \r\n  [9] Â  The affidavit outlined the investigative surveillance of Keithâ€™s home, \r\n  the officersâ€™ observation of Keithâ€™s vehicle as it left the residence, the lawful \r\n  stop, and discovery of marijuana.Â  It also appears from a reading of the affidavit \r\n  that, as in Scott, the officers maintained visual contact with Keith \r\n  from the time he left his residence until he was stopped. \r\n      \r\nIn view the totality of the circumstances \r\n  and considering the nature of the evidence sought, the type of offense involved, \r\n  and experience of the officer involved, we find the magistrate made a practical, \r\n  common-sense determination \r\n  that a fair probability existed that evidence of a crime would be found in Keithâ€™s \r\n  home. [10] Â  We find a common \r\n  sense and logical interpretation of the affidavit accompanying the search warrant \r\n  in this case and the deference, which must be accorded the magistrate, overcomes \r\n  any asserted deficiency. [11] Â  \r\n      CONCLUSION\r\n      \r\nBased upon the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  we conclude the search warrant was properly issued and the trial court correctly \r\n  admitted the evidence obtained as a result of the search.\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n      \r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n    \r\n \r\n  [1] \r\n     We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  [2] \r\n     State v.

McKenzie, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  The South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission denied \r\n  Virginia Coxâ€™s request for partial lump sum payment of her lifetime benefits \r\n  awarded for a brain injury, holding such a lump sum payment is prohibited by \r\n  statute.Â  The circuit court reversed.Â  Coxâ€™s employer, BellSouth Telecommunicationâ€™s, \r\n  appeals. Â We affirm the circuit court ruling that partial lump sum payments \r\n  are permitted and remand for further proceedings.\r\nFACTS \r\nCox was attacked by an unknown assailant with an \r\n  automobile while she was unlocking a gate at BellSouthâ€™s premises.Â  As a result, \r\n  she sustained severe injuries with resulting permanent physical disability, \r\n  including brain damage.Â  The single commissioner awarded her $450.62 compensation \r\n  benefits per week for the remainder of her life pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  42-9-10 (Supp. 2002).Â  BellSouth did not appeal that order.\r\nThereafter, Cox applied for a partial lump sum \r\n  payment of $120,000 from the back end of her lifetime benefits based on her \r\n  life expectancy in order to purchase a home.Â  After a hearing on the application, \r\n  the single commissioner held Cox had proven entitlement to the lump sum payment.Â  \r\n\r\nBellSouth appealed this order to the appellate \r\n  panel of the full commission, which reversed the portion of the order of the \r\n  single commissioner pertaining to Coxâ€™s lump sum award.Â  It found â€œWhile claimant \r\n  had valid reasons for requesting partial lump sum payment of benefits, the Commission \r\n  is constrained by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-301 and \r\n  cannot award a partial lump sum.â€Â  \r\nCox appealed this ruling to the circuit court, \r\n  which reversed the determination of the full commission.Â  The court ruled the \r\n  full commission does have the statutory authority to award a partial lump sum \r\n  payment in brain damage cases.Â Â  BellSouth appealed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nOur review of a decision of the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  commission is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, \r\n  Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Although this court \r\n  may not substitute its judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight \r\n  of the evidence on questions of fact, we may reverse where the decision is affected \r\n  by an error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (A)(6) (Supp. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nBellSouth argues the circuit court erred in reversing \r\n  the order of the full commission.Â  It asserts section 42-9-10 prohibits the \r\n  payment of lump sum payments in physical brain injury cases.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nAs the question of whether \r\n  partial lump sum payments are permitted from lifetime benefits awards has not \r\n  been directly addressed by our courts, the matter is one of first impression \r\n  in our state. [1] Â  As always, \r\n  we look first to the language of the statutes.Â  The cardinal rule of statutory \r\n  interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.Â  Strother v. \r\n  Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 \r\n  (1998).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that \r\n  the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the \r\n  language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended \r\n  purpose of the statute.â€ Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., \r\n  312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  The words of the statute must \r\n  be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced \r\n  construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. \r\n  Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992). Â â€œThe \r\n  language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter \r\n  and accords with its general purpose.â€ Id. (citations omitted).Â  In addition, \r\n  as workersâ€™ compensation statutes provide an exclusive compensatory system in \r\n  derogation of common law rights, we must strictly construe such statutes, leaving \r\n  it to the legislature to amend and define any ambiguities. Wigfall v. Tideland \r\n  Util., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 110, 580 S.E.2d 100, 105 (2003).\r\nSection 42-9-10 governs payment of compensation \r\n  for total disability.Â  It provides, in pertinent part: â€œNotwithstanding the \r\n  provisions of Â§ 42-9-301, no total lump sum payment may be ordered by \r\n  the commission in any case under this section where the injured person is entitled \r\n  to lifetime benefits.â€ (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe plain meaning of the \r\n  term â€œtotalâ€ in section 42-9-10 indicates the General Assembly did not intend \r\n  to prohibit partial lump sum payments of lifetime benefits.Â  Had the \r\n  General Assembly desired to eliminate all lump sum payments in lifetime benefits \r\n  cases, it could have omitted the word â€œtotalâ€ from the provision, or it could \r\n  have specifically provided that â€œallâ€ lump sum payments were prohibited.\r\nWe find this interpretation \r\n  of the statute in harmony with the overall purpose of the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  system.Â  In cases that do not involve lifetime benefits, the commission may \r\n  order total or partial lump sum payment of benefits when it â€œdeems it not to \r\n  be contrary to the best interest of the employee or his dependents, or when \r\n  it will prevent undue hardship on the employer or his insurance carrier, without \r\n  prejudicing the interest of the employee or his dependents.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-9-301 (1985).Â  Once the commission makes such an award, the burden of proof \r\n  as to the commissionâ€™s abuse of discretion in making such an award is upon the \r\n  employer or carrier in any appeal proceeding.Â  Id.Â  \r\nPermitting partial lump \r\n  sum payments provides the commission needed flexibility in lifetime benefits \r\n  cases, flexibility it regularly exercises with respect to all other compensation \r\n  awards, to ensure the best interests of the injured worker are protected.Â  The \r\n  risk that the beneficiary will squander the lump sum payment and be left as \r\n  a ward of the state is reduced by allowing the commission discretion in deciding \r\n  whether to award a lump sum payment with consideration of the factors set forth \r\n  in section 42-9-301.\r\nWe are therefore convinced \r\n  by the language of the statute and the legislative intent that can be discerned \r\n  that the restriction against â€œtotalâ€ lump sum payments set out in section 42-9-10 \r\n  should be construed strictly and not expanded to prohibit all lump sum payments \r\n  in lifetime benefits cases.Â  In the present case, there has been no allegation \r\n  that the partial lump sum award is tantamount to a total lump sum payment.Â  \r\n  We hold that the commission erred as a matter of law in ruling that it was not \r\n  empowered to award a partial lump sum.Â  As the commission has not addressed \r\n  whether a lump sum award would be appropriate under the facts of this case, \r\n  we remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Suitt Construction Co., \r\n    318 S.C. 465, 458 S.E.2d 535 (1995).Â  The Court found such payments were authorized \r\n    under S.C. Code Ann. 42-9-10 (Supp. 2002) despite the language prohibiting \r\n    â€œtotal lump sum payments,â€ narrowly tailoring its rationale to a consideration \r\n    of regulatory provisions and public policy arguments as they relate to payment \r\n    of private counsel in workersâ€™ compensation cases.Â  Id.Â  The court \r\n    acknowledged the uncertainty section 42-9-10 creates with respect to partial \r\n    lump sum payments generally:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Employer contends our interpretation of Â§ 42-9-10 will permit the \r\n    Commission to order partial lump sum benefits to a claimant awarded lifetime \r\n    benefits, a result clearly not intended by the legislature.Â  The sole issue \r\n    presently before this Court is lump sum payment of attorneyâ€™s fees and, accordingly, \r\n    we decline to address Employerâ€™s contention.Â  In any event, if, as Employer \r\n    suggests, the statute and regulation may be so construed, the matter is one \r\n    for the General Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 470, 458 S.E.2d at 538 n.4.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Cox conceded at oral argument that the commission should provide \r\n    for a present day discount for any lump sum payment it awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3684","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan \r\n          McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W.

Morgan, \r\n          of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In a re-trial, \r\n  Tunzy Sanders was convicted of murder, attempted armed robbery, and criminal \r\n  conspiracy.Â  He appeals, arguing his rights under the Confrontation Clause of \r\n  the Sixth Amendment were violated when the trial court admitted the prior testimony \r\n  of Aurelien Vigier, a jailhouse informer, inasmuch as he was unable to confront \r\n  and cross-examine Vigier about an alleged â€œtacit understandingâ€ that Vigier \r\n  would receive â€œsome benefit by virtue of his cooperation in this case.â€Â  We \r\n  affirm.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n\r\nSanders and two others were charged \r\n  following the shooting death of a restaurant employee who was leaving at the \r\n  close of business with that dayâ€™s proceeds.Â  \r\nAt the first trial, two jailhouse \r\n  informants, Aurelien Vigier and David Staley, testified appellant confessed \r\n  to the crime while imprisoned.Â  The State also introduced the statement of Temetrius \r\n  Williams, which placed Sanders and his cohorts at the scene with the intent \r\n  to commit a robbery.Â  Williams retracted her statement on the stand.Â  \r\nThe jury found Sanders guilty as \r\n  charged.Â  Sanders appealed the convictions on the ground his Sixth Amendment \r\n  right to counsel was violated when his sister, an attorney from another state, \r\n  was removed as counsel prior to trial.Â  Our supreme court reversed the convictions \r\n  and remanded the case for a new trial.Â  State v. Sanders, 341 S.C. 386, \r\n  534 S.E.2d 696 (2000).Â  \r\nPrior to re-trial of the case, the \r\n  State moved to admit a transcript of Vigierâ€™s testimony from the first trial \r\n  into evidence, asserting Vigier could not be located for service of subpoena \r\n  because he had left the state in violation of the terms of a probationary sentence.Â  \r\n  Sanders objected to the admission of the prior testimony, arguing its admission \r\n  would violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United \r\n  States Constitution.Â  Specifically, Sandersâ€™ sister, acting as defense counsel, \r\n  asserted that had she been allowed to participate at the first trial she would \r\n  have been more thorough than defense counsel was in cross-examining Vigier concerning \r\n  his alleged deal with the State in exchange for his testimony against Sanders.Â  \r\n  She further asserted that facts regarding the alleged deal were revealed only \r\n  after Vigier testified in the first trial.Â  The trial court found Vigierâ€™s testimony \r\n  was admissible under Rule 804, SCRE.Â  \r\nThe case proceeded to re-trial without \r\n  a jury.Â  Despite Sandersâ€™ denial of any involvement in the murder or robbery, \r\n  the trial court found Sanders guilty as charged and sentenced him to thirty-five \r\n  years imprisonment for murder, twenty-five years imprisonment for armed robbery, \r\n  and five years imprisonment for criminal conspiracy.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n\r\nSanders asserts the admission of \r\n  Vigierâ€™s prior testimony violated his Confrontation Clause rights because he \r\n  was not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the witness regarding â€œsubsequent \r\n  revelationsâ€ pertaining to the Stateâ€™s alleged â€œdealâ€ with the witness.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\n  [W]hen a hearsay declarant is not \r\n    present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally \r\n    requires a showing that he is unavailable. Even then, his statement is admissible \r\n    only if it bears adequate â€œindicia of reliability.â€Â  Reliability can be inferred \r\n    without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay \r\n    exception.Â  In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent \r\n    a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nOhio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. \r\n  56, 66 (1980).Â  Here, Vigier was unavailable and his prior testimony fell within \r\n  an established hearsay exception.Â  Thus, Sandersâ€™ Confrontation Clause rights \r\n  were not violated.\r\nUnder Rule 804(b), SCRE, certain \r\n  statements are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable \r\n  as a witness.Â  Rule 804(b)(1) provides:Â  \r\n \r\n  (b)Â Â Â Â  Hearsay Exceptions.Â  The \r\n    following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable \r\n    as a witness:\r\n  \r\n    (1)Â Â Â Â  Former Testimony.Â  Testimony \r\n      given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, \r\n      or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same \r\n      or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, \r\n      or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity \r\n      and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect \r\n      examination.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ â€œUnavailableâ€ is defined in Rule \r\n  804(a) and includes situations in which the declarant is absent from the hearing \r\n  and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarantâ€™s \r\n  attendance by process or other reasonable means.Â  Here, it is uncontested that \r\n  the State made numerous unsuccessful attempts to procure Vigierâ€™s appearance \r\n  at the re-trial by subpoena and that Vigier was, therefore, unavailable within \r\n  the meaning of Rule 804(a) and (b).Â  \r\nThe more central question, however, \r\n  is whether Sanders was afforded an opportunity and had a sufficiently similar \r\n  motive to develop Vigierâ€™s testimony during the first trial.Â  We agree with \r\n  the trial court that Sanders had such motive and opportunity.Â  At the first \r\n  trial, Vigier testified that while he was incarcerated with Sanders, Sanders \r\n  told him he shot and killed the victim with a .22 caliber pistol, then cleaned \r\n  the gun and threw it on top of a restaurant in Georgia.Â  He further testified \r\n  the State had not offered him a deal and that no promises were made to him to \r\n  secure his testimony.Â  During cross-examination, Vigier acknowledged he hoped \r\n  he would get a deal because of his testimony.Â  \r\nDuring the re-trial, the assistant \r\n  solicitor made the following statement regarding his conversations with Vigier \r\n  before the first trial:Â  \r\n\r\n  We were actually approached by \r\n    his attorney . . . and he asked us if we would give him consideration.Â  And \r\n    we told his attorney . . . we couldnâ€™t get him a deal right now, but we would \r\n    certainly take into account when . . . it came time for him to go to court \r\n    . . . .Â  The State is willing to stipulate that he did receive a recommended \r\n    probation sentence sometime after . . . testifying in this trial, as well \r\n    as the trial of his co-defendants.Â  And itâ€™s the Stateâ€™s testimony that he \r\n    was not given any deal, that we told him his cooperation would be considered \r\n    when it came time for his case to go to court. \r\n\r\nIn ruling the testimony admissible, \r\n  the court stated that in its opinion â€œthere was at least some tacit understanding \r\n  that [Vigier] might get some benefit at some point in time by virtue of [his] \r\n  cooperation.â€Â  \r\nSanders would have this court hold \r\n  that the assistant solicitorâ€™s statements amount to a significant revelation \r\n  as to secret negotiations, and Sandersâ€™ unawareness of these negotiations during \r\n  the prior proceedings negatively impacted his ability to effectively cross-examine \r\n  Vigier.Â  Our review of the record convinces us differently.Â  The assistant solicitorâ€™s \r\n  recount of his conversations with Vigier was consistent with Vigierâ€™s testimony \r\n  at the first trial:Â  Vigier expected he would receive some benefit from his \r\n  testimony against Sanders, but the State made no promise of a deal to secure \r\n  his testimony.Â  Despite ample opportunity, the only question defense counsel \r\n  asked Vigier about his communications with the solicitorâ€™s office was whether \r\n  he was hoping to receive a deal from them.Â  Additionally, although Sanders argues \r\n  the change in other evidence made Vigierâ€™s testimony more central to the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case in the re-trial, Vigier nevertheless testified Sanders confessed to the \r\n  crimes and thus Sanders unquestionably had a motive to develop any potential \r\n  weaknesses in his testimony during cross-examination.Â  Because Sanders had sufficient \r\n  opportunity and motive to develop Vigierâ€™s testimony during the original trial \r\n  to satisfy the requirements of Rule 804(b)(1), SCRE and because Vigier was unavailable, \r\n  the court properly admitted Vigierâ€™s prior testimony in the re-trial.Â  As such, \r\n  Sandersâ€™ right of confrontation was not violated.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct =

Pleasant; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  In this domestic action, \r\n  Mona Rae Wooten (Wife) appeals from the family courtâ€™s order denying her request \r\n  to require Thomas Durrette Wooten, Jr. (Husband) to secure his alimony support \r\n  obligation with a life insurance policy.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\nWife and Husband married in March 1976 and separated in February 1999. Â Husband \r\n  commenced this action against Wife in June 1999 seeking an order of separate \r\n  maintenance, equitable division of marital property, and related relief. Wife \r\n  answered, generally denying Husbandâ€™s entitlement to the relief sought in his \r\n  complaint.Â  She also counterclaimed seeking, among other things, an award of \r\n  alimony and an order requiring Husband to maintain or procure insurance on his \r\n  life for the benefit of Wife and the partiesâ€™ children. \r\nFollowing a five-day hearing in April and May 2000, \r\n  the family court awarded Wife, among other requested relief, one-half the value \r\n  of the partiesâ€™ marital estate ($664,078), and $4,300 per month in permanent, \r\n  periodic alimony. [1] Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the family court specifically reserved jurisdiction to determine Wifeâ€™s request \r\n  for an order requiring Husband to secure his alimony obligation with a life \r\n  insurance policy naming Wife as beneficiary. After a subsequent hearing, the \r\n  court issued a December 2001 order finding Wife failed to establish any compelling \r\n  reason requiring such security.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.Â \r\n    Did the family court err in ruling that a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ \r\n      must exist to require a supporting spouse to secure his or her alimony obligation \r\n      with life insurance?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.Â \r\n    Did the family court err in failing to evaluate the request \r\n      for life insurance in the light of the statutory factors?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate \r\n  court has authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, \r\n  204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not \r\n  require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are we required to ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 \r\n  (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appropriate \r\n  Standard\r\nAs a primary issue on appeal, Wife asserts the family court \r\n  employed an inappropriate standard in considering her request that Husband be \r\n  required to secure his alimony obligation.Â  We hold the family court judge correctly \r\n  ruled that a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ must exist to warrant the maintenance of life \r\n  insurance by the supporting spouse.Â Â  See McElveen v. McElveen, \r\n  332 S.C. 583, 603, 506 S.E.2d 1, 11 (Ct. App. 1998) (securing alimony and child \r\n  support obligations with life insurance policies proper only under compelling \r\n  circumstances).\r\nWife acknowledges that a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ must be shown \r\n  to require the purchase or maintenance of life insurance as security for a child \r\n  support obligation.Â  The child support statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-160 (1976), \r\n  has since its inception recognized the availability of life insurance as security \r\n  for the support obligation.Â  The statute is silent as to the appropriate standard, \r\n  yet Wife is constrained by longstanding case law to concede that life insurance \r\n  may not be required to secure the payment of child support in the absence of \r\n  a compelling reason to do so.\r\nThe alimony statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130, was amended \r\n  in 1990 to expressly provide for life insurance on the supporting spouse for \r\n  the benefit of the supported spouse. \r\n  [2] Â  Before 1990, such relief was available pursuant to case law.Â  See \r\n  Hardin v. Hardin, 294 S.C. 402, 404-405, 365 S.E.2d 34, 35-36 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987) (recognizing that family court may, under â€œspecial circumstances,â€ require \r\n  a supporting spouse to secure an alimony obligation with a life insurance policy).Â  \r\n\r\nSection 20-3-130(D), like the child support counterpart in \r\n  section 20-3-160, is silent as to the proper standard.Â  Wife argues that one \r\n  effect of the 1990 amendment was to remove the â€œcompelling reasonâ€ standard.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  We discern no legitimate reason, from legislative history or otherwise, \r\n  to require a lesser threshold standard for imposing life insurance or other \r\n  security with respect to the payment of alimony.Â  The precedent of this court, \r\n  both before and after 1990, has consistently applied the â€œcompelling reasonâ€ \r\n  standard to secure the payment of alimony and child support.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  McElveen, 332 S.C. at 603, 506 S.E.2d at 11; Hardin, 294 S.C. \r\n  at 404-405, 365 S.E.2d at 35-36.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Statutory \r\n  Factors\r\nWife next contends the family court judge erred in failing to evaluate the \r\n  request for life insurance in the light of the statutory factors enumerated \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(D) (Supp. 2002).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe alimony statute sets forth certain factors to which the \r\n  family court judge must give â€œdue considerationâ€ when â€œmak[ing] provision for \r\n  security for the payment of [alimony].â€Â  Here, the request for life insurance \r\n  to secure the payment of alimony was denied because Wife failed to establish \r\n  a compelling reason to do so.Â  While it is preferable for the family court judge \r\n  to address the statutory factors enumerated in section 20-3-130 (D), the deficiency \r\n  here does not require us to vacate the judgment below.Â  See Griffith \r\n  v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506 S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct. App. 1998)(â€œ[W]hen \r\n  an order from the family court is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), SCRFC, \r\n  the appellate court â€˜may remand the matter to the trial court or, where the \r\n  record is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.â€™â€)(quoting Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405 \r\n  S.E.2d 821, 822 (1991)).Â Â  In the present matter, the family court made findings \r\n  regarding the health condition of each party, Wifeâ€™s earnings and benefits from \r\n  employment, and Husbandâ€™s longstanding practice of making his alimony payments \r\n  in a timely manner.Â  Having carefully canvassed the record, we concur with these \r\n  findings.Â  Moreover, we have examined the record in light of the statutory factors \r\n  and conclude the court correctly denied Wifeâ€™s request for life insurance to \r\n  secure the payment of alimony.\r\nWife relies heavily on the self-evident truth that she, like any former spouse \r\n  receiving alimony, would benefit financially from life insurance in the event \r\n  of the payorâ€™s death.Â  That fact, however, does not translate into a â€œcompelling \r\n  reason,â€ for to so hold would essentially require life insurance in almost every \r\n  case where alimony is awarded.Â  It is significant to note that alimony terminates \r\n  upon certain conditions, including the death of either spouse.Â  SeeÂ  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.

Rosen, and Daniel F. Blanchard, III, both of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â Â  Mary and Stephen Slack (â€œSellersâ€) \r\n  filed a complaint against Lonnie and Shannon James (â€œBuyersâ€) concerning a real \r\n  estate contract.Â  Buyers appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing and \r\n  striking their counterclaims.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nWhen\r\nwe view the facts as alleged in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the\r\nBuyers, the pleadings show Sellers and Buyers, each represented by real estate\r\nagents, entered into a written contract for the sale of Sellersâ€™ home for\r\n$1,208,000.00.&nbsp; The sales contract\r\nincludes the following provisions, which we quote only in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  14.&nbsp;\r\n  ENCUMBRANCES AND RESTRICTIONS.\r\n  Buyer agrees to accept property subject to: . . . restrictive covenants and\r\n  easements of record, provided they do not materially affect [the] present use\r\n  of said property.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.Â  This written instrument \r\n      expresses the entire agreement, and all promises, covenants, and warranties \r\n      between the Buyer and Seller. . . .Â  Both Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge \r\n      that they have not received or relied upon any statements or representations \r\n      by either Broker or their agents which are not expressly stipulated herein.\r\n\r\n     After\r\n    entering into the contract, Buyers hired an attorney to handle the closing.&nbsp;\r\n    In conducting a title examination of the property, the title examiner\r\n    informed Buyersâ€™ attorney that there was a permanent four-inch sewer\r\n    easement across the property.&nbsp;\r\n    The sewer line easement materially affects the present use of the\r\n    property.&nbsp;\r\n    At this point, Buyers refused to purchase the property.&nbsp;\r\n    Prior to entering into the written contract, Buyers had asked\r\n    Sellersâ€™ real estate agent â€œwhether there were any easements on the\r\n    propertyâ€ and the agent indicated none existed.\r\n       Sellers filed a complaint against \r\n        Buyers alleging breach of contract and seeking (1) specific performance, \r\n        (2) actual damages, and (3) forfeiture of earnest money deposit and/or \r\n        liquidated damages.Â  Buyers filed an answer asserting a general denial \r\n        and a counterclaim for breach of contract. Sellers then filed an amended \r\n        complaint alleging the same cause of action and seeking the same relief \r\n        as the original complaint. Buyers filed an answer and asserted the following \r\n        counterclaims:Â  (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud, (3) negligent misrepresentation, \r\n        and (4) violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA). \r\n        [1] \r\n      Sellers filed a motion to dismiss \r\n        or to strike Buyersâ€™ counterclaims pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(f), \r\n        SCRCP.\r\n      Based on the parol evidence rule and the \r\n        merger doctrine, the circuit court partially struck from Buyersâ€™ breach \r\n        of contract counterclaim four allegations of oral statements made prior \r\n        to the partiesâ€™ contract that are also realleged by reference in the fraud \r\n        and negligent misrepresentation causes of action.Â  The court then dismissed \r\n        Buyersâ€™ fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and UTPA counterclaims, finding \r\n        Buyers failed to exercise reasonable care to protect their interests and \r\n        had no right to rely on the alleged misrepresentation by Sellersâ€™ agent.Â  \r\n        The circuit court denied Buyersâ€™ subsequent motion to alter or amend, \r\n        pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\r\n       STANDARD\r\n      OF REVIEW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        In deciding whether the circuit court \r\n        properly granted the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, this \r\n        court must consider whether the complaint, when viewed in the light most \r\n        favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief. \r\n        [2] Â  A motion to dismiss â€œshould not be granted if â€˜facts alleged \r\n        and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff \r\n        to any relief on any theory of the case.â€™â€ \r\n        [3] Â  The circuit courtâ€™s ruling on a motion to strike will not be \r\n        reversed absent an abuse of discretion. \r\n        [4] Â  \r\n        LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n           Buyers argue the circuit court erred \r\n            in dismissing their counterclaims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\n            Specifically, Buyers argue the court erred in finding they acted unreasonably \r\n            in relying upon an oral representation whose falsity could have been \r\n            ascertained by a title examination of the property. \r\n          The recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation \r\n            of fact is justified in relying on its truth, although he might have \r\n            discovered its falsity through investigation. [5] Â  â€œThe person committing the fraud cannot defeat a claim for \r\n            misrepresentation simply because the person defrauded is charged with \r\n            notice under a recording statute, particularly where the misrepresented \r\n            facts are peculiarly within the representorâ€™s knowledge.â€ \r\n            [6] Â  The purpose of the recording act is to protect one who buys \r\n            a recorded title against one who acquires a paper title but fails \r\n            to record it.Â  The recording act is not intended to protect a seller \r\n            who makes a false or misleading statement. \r\n            [7] \r\n          We think this case falls squarely within \r\n            our holding in Reid v. Harbison Development Corporation. [8] Â  Once Sellersâ€™ real estate agent \r\n            made a statement about the lack of an easement on the property, Buyers \r\n            were justified in relying upon the truth of the statement. [9] Â  While Buyers could have ascertained \r\n            the existence of the easement through investigation of public records, \r\n            they were not required to investigate the public record to assert \r\n            a tort claim for fraud or negligent misrepresentation later on. [10] Â  The question of whether Buyers \r\n            could reasonably rely on the statement at issue in view of the information \r\n            entered upon the public record is for a jury, not the court, to determine.Â  \r\n          \r\n          The circuit court erred, therefore, when \r\n            it found Buyers acted unreasonably as a matter of law in relying upon \r\n            the misrepresentation.\r\n          Regarding the merger and disclaimer provisions \r\n            in the contract, they likewise afford no protection to Sellers to \r\n            the counterclaims asserted against them for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. [11] \r\n          CONCLUSION\r\n          Based upon the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s order \r\n            dismissing Buyersâ€™ counterclaims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation \r\n            and striking allegations of oral statements made prior to the partiesâ€™ \r\n            contract so far as they are realleged by reference in these two counterclaims \r\n            is\r\n           REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n          HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C.

Morris, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Paul Trouche and Thomas S. White, both of Charleston, and \r\n  R. Allen Young, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This appeal concerns whether \r\n  a parcel of property owned by Mary Livingston is subject to a special assessment \r\n  that was imposed by the Town of Mt. Pleasant to fund the widening and improvement \r\n  of Patriots Point Boulevard.Â  The assessment was adopted pursuant to the Municipal \r\n  Improvement Act of 1999. [1] Â  The circuit court upheld the assessment, and Livingston appeals.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMary Livingston \r\n  [2]  owns a parcel of property adjoining Patriots Point Boulevard in the \r\n  Town of Mt. Pleasant.Â  In May 2001, the Town Council of Mt. Pleasant adopted \r\n  a resolution creating the Patriots Point Improvement District to implement the \r\n  Patriots Point Improvement Plan.Â  The Improvement Plan involved widening and \r\n  redesigning Patriots Point Boulevard and provided for landscaping, the construction \r\n  of sidewalks, and the addition of pedestrian and biking trails.Â  The Improvement \r\n  Plan also contemplated improvements to drainage and to the intersection where \r\n  Coleman Boulevard meets Patriots Point Boulevard.Â  \r\nThe Town Councilâ€™s resolution anticipated the total cost \r\n  of the project, as estimated by the Improvement Plan, would be $5,110,000.Â  \r\n  The Town of Mt. Pleasant was to contribute $1,470,000 and the remaining $3,640,000 \r\n  was to come from special assessments imposed on the property owners within the \r\n  District.Â  The vast majority of these assessments were to be from commercial \r\n  property owners with previous development agreements with Mt. Pleasant.Â  The \r\n  remainder of the assessments, estimated at only $168,101, was to come from individual, \r\n  private property owners like Livingston.Â  Livingstonâ€™s parcel, like that of \r\n  other members of the District, was undeveloped and commercially zoned.Â  None \r\n  of the parcels in the District is owner-occupied residential property.Â  \r\nThe Town Council based the amount of each property \r\n  ownerâ€™s assessment on the ratio of the acreage of the assessed property to the \r\n  total acreage of all of the assessed properties in the District.Â  The District \r\n  consisted of nearly 400 acres.Â  Livingstonâ€™s parcel measured 4.63 acres, and \r\n  the Town Council calculated her assessment at $46,218 as her pro rata share \r\n  relative to the total acreage in the District.Â Â Â  \r\nThe ordinance formally creating the District was enacted \r\n  on June 25, 2001. [3] Â  The Town Council found that \r\n  the improvements would be beneficial within the District and encourage development, \r\n  would preserve or increase property values within the District, and would likely \r\n  maintain or improve the general welfare and tax base.Â  The Town Council further \r\n  found it would be fair and equitable to finance all or part of the costs by \r\n  an assessment.Â  \r\nLivingston appeared at a hearing before the Special Committee \r\n  of the Town Council to object to the special assessment imposed on her parcel, \r\n  but the assessment was upheld.Â  Livingston appealed to the circuit court, which \r\n  affirmed and ordered Livingston to pay her share of the special assessment.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals regarding assessments â€œshall be heard and determined \r\n  on the record in the manner of appeals from administrative bodies in this State.â€ [4] Â  Appeals from administrative \r\n  bodies are governed by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which provides \r\n  the reviewing court must affirm the agencyâ€™s decision if it is supported by \r\n  substantial evidence; further, the court â€œmay not substitute [its] judgment \r\n  for that of the agency upon questions as to which there is room for a difference \r\n  of intelligent opinion.â€ [5] Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla \r\n  of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow \r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.â€ \r\n  [6] Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLivingston asserts the circuit court erred in upholding the \r\n  special assessment against her property because the improvements should have \r\n  beenÂ  totally paid for out of the general tax revenue and, even if the improvements \r\n  were the proper subject of an assessment, the amount of her assessment was not \r\n  supported by the record.\r\nI.\r\nWe first consider Livingstonâ€™s contention that the improvements \r\n  should have been paid for out of the general tax revenue.Â  \r\nNormally, taxes are imposed on all property for the maintenance \r\n  of the government, while assessments are imposed only on the property that is \r\n  to be benefited. [7] Â  In order \r\n  to impose an assessment on property for an improvement, the improvement must \r\n  confer a benefit on the property that is distinguishable from the general benefit \r\n  enjoyed by surrounding areas. [8] Â  \r\nThe Municipal Improvement Act of 1999 authorizes municipalities \r\n  to establish improvement districts and create improvement plans in order to \r\n  preserve or increase property values within the district, to prevent deterioration \r\n  of urban areas, and to preserve the tax base and general welfare of the municipality. [9]\r\nÂ  An improvement district may \r\n  be established when it would be fair and equitable to do so and the improvements \r\n  would confer a special benefit to members of the District. [10]\r\nThe municipality is authorized to finance such improvement \r\n  plans by the imposition of assessments, the issuance of bonds, or any combination \r\n  of these methods. [11] Â  \r\nIt is within the power and discretion of the legislature \r\n  or, where delegated by statute, to a municipal corporation, â€œto determine whether \r\n  the general public or property owners whose property abuts, fronts on, or is \r\n  adjacent to [ ] a local improvement and is specially benefited[,] at least to \r\n  the extent [of] the cost thereof[,] shall pay the entire cost thereof, or whether \r\n  the cost shall be apportioned between the public and such property owners, and, \r\n  if so, the proportion to be paid by each.â€ \r\n  [12] Â  \r\nâ€œAs a general rule, the courts consider the widening of a \r\n  street to be of special benefit to the adjacent property so as to constitute \r\n  a local improvement justifying a special assessment on such property, especially \r\n  when the widening of the street makes it more attractive for commercial operations.â€ [13] Â  Additionally, where a street \r\n  widening or improvement has resulted in special benefits to adjacent properties, \r\n  they can be specially assessed even though the improvement project will also \r\n  be of some general benefit to the public. [14] Â  \r\nIn the current case, when the Town Councilâ€™s proposal was \r\n  first presented to the property owners, the improvement of Patriots Point Boulevard \r\n  was seen by Town Council representatives as primarily benefiting â€œusers of the \r\n  Patriots Point area, which includes the Patriots Development Authority property \r\n  as well as the leased properties from Patriots Point.â€Â  It was further noted \r\n  â€œthat 60%-70% of the citizens in the Town would not utilize this road.â€Â  Moreover, \r\n  the use of the municipal improvement district was seen as an equitable means \r\n  by which to improve the road in the area and pay the cost thereof.Â  \r\nIn the resolution establishing the Patriots Point Improvement \r\n  Plan, the Town Council found and determined that it had the power under the \r\n  Act â€œto effect improvements within an improvement district to preserve property \r\n  values, prevent deterioration of urban areas, and preserve their tax bases.â€Â  \r\n  The Town Council further found the Improvement Plan â€œwas necessary and in the \r\n  best interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of \r\n  the Town.â€Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In upholding the establishment of the District, \r\n  the circuit court found that the Town Council â€œpassed an ordinance to develop \r\n  Patriots Point Boulevard after finding that this project would increase property \r\n  values of the members of the District, would protect the tax base of the town, \r\n  and would encourage development in the District.â€Â  The court found that â€œLivingstonâ€™s \r\n  property, like that of other members of the District, is an undeveloped parcel, \r\n  commercially zoned, and fronts on Patriots Point Boulevardâ€ and that â€œ[i]t is \r\n  reasonable to assume that the improvements contemplated will encourage development \r\n  in the District and will enhance the value of . . . Livingstonâ€™s property.â€Â  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The court further found that â€œit is clear that \r\n  the decision of Mt. Pleasant to require adjoining property owners to pay a small \r\n  portion of the total cost of the project is fair and equitable within the meaning \r\n  of the Municipal Improvement[] Act,â€ especially considering that â€œMt. Pleasant \r\n  itself will pay $1,470,000.00 of the total costâ€ of the project and private \r\n  property owners will pay only $168,101.Â  \r\nUnder these circumstances and considering the record as a \r\n  whole, we hold the circuit court did not err in upholding the decision of the \r\n  Town Council to establish the District.Â  Although reasonable persons could disagree, \r\n  we find there was no basis for the circuit court to substitute its opinion for \r\n  that of the Town Council regarding the propriety of establishing the District.Â  \r\n  As noted by the circuit court, Patriots Point Boulevard is a dead-end road primarily \r\n  serving commercial business properties located along the boulevard.Â  The primary \r\n  beneficiaries of any improvement along the road are the adjoining property owners \r\n  and their portion of the total cost of this rather substantial project is comparatively \r\n  small.Â  We see no reason, therefore, to disturb the courtâ€™s ruling. \r\n  [15] Â  \r\nII.\r\nLivingston further argues that, even if the improvements \r\n  were the proper subject of an assessment, the circuit court erred in upholding \r\n  the amount of her assessment.Â  Specifically, she contends the Town Council should \r\n  have used the front-footage method to apportion the assessments imposed rather \r\n  than the area method.\r\nUnder the Municipal Improvement Act of 1999, the \r\n  governing body of a municipality may impose assessments within an improvement \r\n  district â€œbased on assessed value, front footage, area, per parcel basis, the \r\n  value of improvements to be constructed within the district, or any combination \r\n  of [these methods].â€ [16] Â  \r\n  â€œThe apportionment of benefits received from a special assessment is a legislative \r\n  function and, if reasonable persons may differ as to whether the land assessed \r\n  is benefited by the improvement, the finding of the legislative body that it \r\n  does must stand.â€ [17] Â  â€œIncluded \r\n  within the broad discretion accorded to a special assessment commission [or \r\n  governing body] is the discretion to choose the method used to determine the \r\n  benefits and apportion the costs to individual properties within the improvement \r\n  district.â€ [18] Â  \r\nIn the case before us, the Town Council opted to apportion \r\n  the amount of the assessments based on the area method, i.e., the assessment \r\n  was based on the ratio of the acreage of the assessed property to the total \r\n  acreage of all of the assessed properties in the District.Â  Livingston asserts \r\n  the Town Council should have used the front-footage method instead of basing \r\n  it on the area of the property because her parcel, while large, has only approximately \r\n  fifty feet of frontage on Patriots Point Boulevard.Â  \r\nIn rejecting Livingstonâ€™s contention that the assessment \r\n  should have been based on front footage, the circuit court found that â€œ[t]he \r\n  frontage length is not the relevant measure of value.Â  The important advantage \r\n  for members of the District is proximity to traffic flow and the opportunity \r\n  to benefit through points for entrance and egress between their properties and \r\n  Patriots Point Boulevard.â€Â  The court noted that â€œ[t]his is not a function of \r\n  space; it is a function of proximity.Â  It would be discriminatory to subject \r\n  those owners who happen to have more footage on Patriots Point Boulevard to \r\n  a higher assessment for this reason alone.â€Â  The court further observed that, \r\n  â€œ[w]hile some members of the District inevitably pay a higher assessment because \r\n  they own more acreage, there is no demonstrably fairer way to establish the \r\n  assessment among the alternatives presented under the [Municipal Improvement] \r\n  Act.â€Â  The court concluded that the Town Council had observed the requirements \r\n  set forth in the Act in selecting a method of apportionment and that there had \r\n  been no showing that the Town Councilâ€™s actions were â€œarbitrary, capricious, \r\n  or clearly erroneous, the only standards under the [APA] upon which . . . Livingston \r\n  . . . made her challenge.â€Â  \r\nConsidering the record as a whole, we see no reason to depart \r\n  from the circuit courtâ€™s determination that the Town Council did not act improperly \r\n  in choosing the area method of apportionment and in calculating the amount of \r\n  Livingstonâ€™s special assessment. \r\n  [19] Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHOWARD, AND BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  S.C.
