Rhoden, of Gaffney, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â  Christopher Clarke Horton \r\n  was indicted for felony driving under the influence causing death (felony DUI) \r\n  and reckless homicide.Â  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of reckless homicide \r\n  and not guilty of felony DUI.Â  The trial judge sentenced Horton to ten years \r\n  imprisonment.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn September 26, 2001, Gregory Thomas, fourteen years old,\r\nwas struck and killed while walking with his family.&nbsp; Horton was driving\r\nthe vehicle that struck Thomas.\r\nAt trial, the State presented the testimony of Suzie\r\nThomas (Gregory's mother) and Geoffrey Thomas (Gregory's nineteen-year-old\r\nbrother).&nbsp; Suzie stated that she, Gregory, and Geoffrey were walking down\r\nthe left-hand side of a road near their home shortly after 6:30 p.m.&nbsp; Suzie\r\nprofessed that, as they saw a green car approaching, the three crossed the\r\nroad.&nbsp; According to Suzie, even though all three of them looked both ways\r\nbefore crossing, Gregory was struck by a white car that was coming down the road\r\n&quot;very fast.&quot;&nbsp; Suzie stated that, when she &quot;looked to go\r\nacross the road,&quot; she did not see the white car.&nbsp; Suzie and Geoffrey\r\n&quot;made it to the side of the . . . road.&quot;&nbsp; Suzie said Gregory was\r\n&quot;almost on the side of the road on the grass, but he had not made it to the\r\nside of the road.&quot;&nbsp; Suzie declared:\r\n\r\n  And when I saw the car coming, I screamed &quot;Gregory,\r\n  get out of the road.&nbsp; Go to the side.&quot;&nbsp; And as I said that,\r\n  Gregory's right leg went up like he was going to step on the grass.&nbsp; And\r\n  when he did that, the car hit him and he flew up.\r\n\r\nAfter striking Gregory, the white car proceeded down the\r\nstreet for approximately 275 feet.&nbsp; When Horton stopped and exited the\r\nvehicle, Suzie asked: &quot;'Why did you hit my son?'&quot;&nbsp; Horton\r\nresponded: &quot;'[B]ecause he wouldn't get out of my way.'&quot;\r\nOn cross-examination, Suzie admitted she did not\r\n&quot;tell any of the police officers about&quot; the green car.&nbsp; When\r\nqueried as to whether she told the officers about Horton's statement that her\r\n&quot;son wouldn't get out of the way,&quot; Suzie answered: &quot;I don't\r\nremember.&nbsp; I don't think so . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Suzie acknowledged she did\r\nnot see Horton's car until it hit Gregory.&nbsp; The following colloquy occurred\r\non cross-examination:\r\n\r\n  Q. Well, I believe you said that you never saw the white\r\n  car.\r\n  A. No, I never saw the white car until we stepped over, but he was-that's how\r\n  fast he came up on us.\r\n  Q. So you only saw the white car just a split second before it hit your son?\r\n  A. Right when it hit my son.\r\n  Q. So that's the only time that you saw the white car?\r\n  A. Yes.&nbsp; I heard him.&nbsp; I heard it and that's when I, you know,\r\n  screamed for Gregory, and then he-before Gregory could step over onto the\r\n  grass, he hit him.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey corroborated Suzie's testimony regarding the\r\nfacts leading up to the accident.&nbsp; Geoffrey testified he did not see the\r\nwhite car when they began to cross the road and did not &quot;hear any\r\nbrakes&quot; or see any skid marks after the accident.&nbsp; Geoffrey did not\r\ntestify that Horton made a statement after exiting the white car.&nbsp;\r\nOfficer David H. Burgess, with the South Carolina Highway\r\nPatrol, was the responding officer.&nbsp; Officer Burgess testified that, upon\r\nreaching the accident scene, he noticed there were no skid marks on the\r\nroad.&nbsp; While sitting beside Horton in his patrol vehicle, Officer Burgess\r\ndetected &quot;an odor of alcohol.&quot;&nbsp; Although the officer did not\r\nperform any field sobriety tests and noted that Horton did not slur his speech\r\nor stagger, he opined that Horton was under the influence.&nbsp; Officer Burgess\r\nstated that Horton's attitude after the accident was unusual, commenting that\r\nHorton was &quot;unemotional.&quot;&nbsp; The officer admitted he did not know\r\n&quot;anything about [a] green car&quot; until the day of trial.\r\nHorton was given a Datamaster test at the Spartanburg\r\nCounty Detention Center.&nbsp; Horton registered a 0.03.&nbsp; Highway Patrol\r\nOfficer Russell Joye, who administered the test, testified Horton was\r\ncooperative, and that he did not smell an odor of alcohol on Horton's person.\r\nAfter the Datamaster test, Officer Joye drove Horton to the hospital for a urine\r\ntest.&nbsp; Horton signed an implied consent form before a urine sample was\r\ncollected.&nbsp; On direct examination, Sue Mobley, a nurse at the hospital who\r\nparticipated in the urine test, was asked if she smelled any alcohol on\r\nHorton.&nbsp; Mobley answered: &quot;A slight smell.&quot;\r\nRobert Michael Sears, a forensic toxicologist with SLED,\r\nlater analyzed the urine sample.&nbsp; The results of the urine test indicated\r\nthe presence of a tetrahydrocannabinol metabolite, hydrocodone, dihydrocodeine,\r\nand benzoylecgonine.&nbsp; Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC, is\r\nthe &quot;pharmacologically active component of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nHydrocodone and dihydrocodeine are opiates.&nbsp; Benzoylecgonine is a\r\n&quot;major metabolite&quot; of cocaine.&nbsp; A blood test was not\r\nperformed.&nbsp; Sears declared that &quot;what [he] found in the urine test,\r\nplus the alcohol that was in [Horton's] system,&quot; would &quot;affect a\r\nperson's ability to drive.&quot;&nbsp; According to Sears, urine tests show\r\n&quot;a history of use,&quot; but &quot;not necessarily [the] presence of drugs\r\nin the blood.&quot;&nbsp; On cross-examination, defense counsel posited the\r\nfollowing question to Sears: &quot;So without the blood test, we don't know\r\nwhether or not Mr. Horton was under the effects of those drugs at the time of\r\nthis accident, do we?&quot;&nbsp; Sears answered: &quot;That's\r\ncorrect.&quot;&nbsp; The following exchange occurred between defense counsel and\r\nDr. David H. Eagerton, chief toxicologist at SLED:\r\n\r\n  Q. All right.&nbsp; So by looking at this evidence here,\r\n  this urine test, it doesn't tell you anything about what was in Mr. Horton's\r\n  blood at the time of this accident, does it?\r\n  A. At exactly the time of the accident, no, it doesn't.&nbsp; It only tells\r\n  you what was in his blood within that three-day window.\r\n\r\n  Horton presented the testimony of \r\n    Alison Cocoros, the chief investigator for the Spartanburg County Coronerâ€™s \r\n    Office.Â  Cocoros observed Horton at the accident scene.Â  When asked by defense \r\n    counsel if she â€œsmell[ed] any odor of alcohol on Mr. Horton that evening when \r\n    [she] talked to him,â€ Cocoros answered in the affirmative.Â  However, when \r\n    queried regarding whether Horton appeared to be impaired, she responded: â€œNo, \r\n    sir.â€Â \r\n    Cocoros spoke with Suzie and Geoffrey at the \r\n      hospital on the night of the accident.Â  She declared that neither Suzie \r\n      nor Geoffrey mentioned a green car â€œcoming in the opposite directionâ€ or \r\n      any statement made by Horton after the accident.Â  Cocoros stated that Suzie \r\n      and Geoffrey told her the following when explaining the events leading up \r\n      to the accident:\r\n\r\n    When I asked them what had happened, . . . [t]hey stated \r\n      that they walked around the curve on Casey Creek Road, that the son Geoff \r\n      and Ms. Thomas crossed to the right-hand shoulder.Â  Gregory was in the middle \r\n      of the left-hand lane.Â  They said that they heard a car behind them.Â  They \r\n      started telling Gregory to get out of the road.Â  Instead of crossing to \r\n      the left this way, he crossed to the right towards them on this side of \r\n      the road and a car came around the curve and hit him.\r\n\r\n    Kristin Rodgers was Hortonâ€™s passenger \r\n      on the night of the accident.Â  She testified in his defense.Â  Rodgers stated \r\n      Horton had two beers at dinner and did not have any problems operating his \r\n      car.Â  Rodgers discussed the accident:\r\n\r\n    We are going down the road.Â  We starting to go around a curve and there is three \r\n      people walking in the middle of the road, and [Horton] slowed down.Â  A lady \r\n      and a boy went to the right side of the road and another boy went to the \r\n      left side of the road to let us through.Â  So we starting to go through them \r\n      and as we are starting to go through them, the boy from the left side of \r\n      the road runs back on the right side of the road and thatâ€™s when we hit \r\n      him. . . . [I]t all happened in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\n    Hortonâ€™s testimony corroborated that of his \r\n      passenger.Â  He affirmed that he had two beers with dinner, but had drunk \r\n      no other alcohol that day.Â  Horton denied taking any drugs on the day of \r\n      the accident.Â  However, he admitted to smoking marijuana and snorting cocaine \r\n      three days before, and taking a Lortab two days before the accident.Â  Both \r\n      Horton and Rodgers testified they did not know of anything that Horton could \r\n      have done to avoid the accident.\r\n    At trial, Horton moved to suppress \r\n      the results of the urine test, arguing improper procedure, an incomplete \r\n      chain of custody, and the urine test results were more prejudicial than \r\n      probative under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  At \r\n      the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Horton moved for a directed verdict on the \r\n      charges of felony DUI and reckless homicide.Â  This motion was denied.Â  After \r\n      he presented his case, Horton renewed his motion for a directed verdict, \r\n      which was denied.Â  The jury returned a guilty verdict as to reckless homicide \r\n      and a not guilty verdict as to felony DUI.\r\n    ISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial judge err in failing to grant Hortonâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n      verdict as to the reckless homicide charge?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial judge err in admitting the results of the urine test?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.\r\n         Did the trial judge err in allowing the State to present evidence that \r\n      Horton lacked remorse?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Directed Verdict â€“ Reckless Homicide\r\n    Horton argues the trial judge erred in denying\r\n    Horton's motion for a directed verdict as to the reckless homicide\r\n    charge.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\n    On appeal from the denial of a directed \r\n      verdict in a criminal case, an appellate court must view the evidence in \r\n      the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. \r\n      622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d \r\n      32 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 \r\n      (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial \r\n      court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its \r\n      weight.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002); State \r\n      v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 584 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. \r\n      McLauren, 349 S.C. 488, 563 S.E.2d 346 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If there is \r\n      any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending \r\n      to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly \r\n      submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Rosemond, 356 S.C. 426, 589 S.E.2d \r\n      757 (2003); State v. Lindsey, 355 S.C. 15, 583 S.E.2d 740 (2003); \r\n      see also State v. Ballington, 346 S.C. 262, 551 S.E.2d 280 \r\n      (Ct. App. 2001) (stating judge should deny motion for directed verdict if \r\n      there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably \r\n      tends to prove accusedâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and \r\n      logically deduced).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed \r\n      verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  \r\n      State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); State \r\n      v. McCluney, Op. No. 3742 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 2, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n      Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 63); State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 580 S.E.2d \r\n      159 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n    â€œWhen the death of a\r\n    person ensues within three years as a proximate result of injury received by\r\n    the driving of a vehicle in reckless disregard of the safety of others, the\r\n    person operating the vehicle is guilty of reckless homicide. . . .â€&nbsp;\r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2910(A) (Supp. 2003).&nbsp;\r\n    Reckless homicide requires proof that the defendant (1) operated an\r\n    automobile; (2) in reckless disregard for the safety of others; (3) the\r\n    defendantâ€™s conduct proximately caused injury to the victim; and (4)\r\n    within three years, the victim died as a result of these injuries.&nbsp;\r\n    See State v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 563 S.E.2d 336\r\n    (2002). See State v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002).\r\n    To convict an individual of reckless \r\n      homicide, the State must prove the individual was driving a vehicle â€œin \r\n      reckless disregard of the safety of others.â€Â  State v. Rowell, 326 \r\n      S.C. 313, 487 S.E.2d 185 (1997).Â  Reckless disregard for the safety of others \r\n      signifies an indifference to the consequences of oneâ€™s acts.Â  Id.; \r\n      see also McKnight, 352 S.C. at 645, 576 S.E.2d at 173 (â€œ[I]n \r\n      reckless homicide cases, we have held that reckless disregard for the safety \r\n      of others signifies an indifference to the consequences of oneâ€™s acts.â€).Â  \r\n      It denotes a conscious failure to exercise due care or ordinary care or \r\n      a conscious indifference to the rights and safety of others or a reckless \r\n      disregard thereof.Â  Rowell, 326 S.C. at 315, 487 S.E.2d at 186.\r\n    We find the State presented\r\n    sufficient evidence to submit the reckless homicide charge to the jury.&nbsp;\r\n    Both Suzie and Geoffrey Thomas testified that Gregory looked both\r\n    ways before crossing the street.&nbsp; The\r\n    Thomases declared they did not see the white car that Horton was driving\r\n    until it struck and killed Gregory.&nbsp; Officer\r\n    Burgessâ€™s testimony that there were no skid marks on the road where the\r\n    car struck Gregory supported the statement by the Thomases that Hortonâ€™s\r\n    car came upon them very quickly.&nbsp; Officer\r\n    Burgess said that he detected â€œan odor of alcoholâ€ on Hortonâ€™s person\r\n    and, although Horton was not slurring his speech or staggering, he believed\r\n    Horton was under the influence.&nbsp; The\r\n    officer indicated that his suspicions were strengthened by the fact that\r\n    Horton was â€œunemotionalâ€ after the accident and that â€œ[h]is attitude\r\n    and behavior just didnâ€™t add up to [the] reality of what had just\r\n    happened.â€&nbsp; The forensic\r\n    toxicologist with SLED noted that, at the time of the accident, Horton had\r\n    alcohol, THC, opiate derivatives, and cocaine metabolite in his system.&nbsp;\r\n    A jury could conclude from these facts that, on the day in question,\r\n    Horton operated his vehicle â€œin reckless disregard of the safety of\r\n    others.â€\r\n    The State presented\r\n    evidence reasonably tending to prove Hortonâ€™s guilt of the offense of\r\n    reckless homicide.&nbsp; Accordingly,\r\n    the trial judge did not err in denying Hortonâ€™s motion for a directed\r\n    verdict on the charge of reckless homicide.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Urine Test&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Horton\r\n    contends the trial judge erred in admitting the results of his urine test.&nbsp;\r\n    We disagree.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    An in\r\n    camera hearing was held to determine the admissibility of the urine\r\n    test.&nbsp; Officer Joye testified\r\n    that, after administering the Datamaster, he asked Horton to submit to a\r\n    urine test.&nbsp; The officer drove\r\n    Horton to the emergency room (ER) at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center.&nbsp;\r\n    He filled out the implied consent form at the hospital.&nbsp;\r\n    Horton signed the implied consent form.&nbsp;\r\n    Because a male nurse was not available to go in the bathroom with\r\n    Horton while he was giving the sample, Officer Joye went into the â€œone\r\n    unit bathroomâ€ with Horton and observed him give the urine sample.&nbsp;\r\n    The bathroom had a toilet but no stall.&nbsp;\r\n    Horton handed the urine sample to Officer Joye.&nbsp;\r\n    The officer then passed the sample to an ER staff nurse, Sue Mobley,\r\n    who had observed from outside the partially open door.&nbsp;\r\n    Mobley â€œlabeled the kit, as far as putting the tape over the urine\r\n    sampleâ€ and â€œput[ting] the identification information . . . on it.â€&nbsp;\r\n    After Mobley signed, sealed, and labeled the urine sample, she\r\n    returned the sample to Officer Joye.&nbsp; Officer\r\n    Joye gave the urine sample to Officer Burgess for transport.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Officer\r\n    Burgess witnessed Mobley sign the â€œspecimen seal.â€&nbsp;\r\n    Officer Burgess signed the outside of the box indicating that he had\r\n    received the urine sample.&nbsp; The\r\n    officer â€œkept the sample in his possession until [he] turned it in to the\r\n    evidence locker at the patrol office.â€&nbsp;\r\n    Officer Burgess stated he did not sign the sample in to the evidence\r\n    locker until September 27.&nbsp; He\r\n    could not recall at what time he placed the sample in the evidence locker.&nbsp;\r\n    Further, he did not remember whether he stored the sample in his\r\n    personal refrigerator prior to placing it in the evidence locker.&nbsp;\r\n    When he placed the sample in the evidence locker, â€œ[t]he bottle\r\n    [was] sealed and [was] in plastic.&nbsp; And\r\n    on the outside . . . of the box there [are] tabs . . . that are sealed and\r\n    initialed.â€&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Sergeant William Eugene\r\n    Williford removed the urine sample from the evidence locker and transported\r\n    it to SLED headquarters in Columbia.&nbsp; When\r\n    Sergeant Williford arrived at SLED, the evidence technician removed the\r\n    sample from the box and placed it in a plastic bag.&nbsp;\r\n    Sergeant Williford sealed the bag, initialed it, and placed it in the\r\n    SLED drop box.&nbsp; When asked on\r\n    cross-examination what type of container the sample was contained in when he\r\n    removed it from the evidence locker, Sergeant Williford responded: â€œA\r\n    styrofoam-type container.â€&nbsp; He\r\n    stated the urine sample was in a plastic container which was inside a sealed\r\n    box which was inside a second sealed box.&nbsp;\r\n    Robert Michael Sears, the SLED forensic toxicologist, confirmed that\r\n    he removed Hortonâ€™s sample from a sealed plastic bag prior to conducting\r\n    his analysis of the urine sample.&nbsp; The\r\n    trial judge denied Hortonâ€™s motion to suppress the results of the urine\r\n    test.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    The\r\n    admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the\r\n    trial judge.&nbsp; State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App.\r\n    2003).&nbsp; A courtâ€™s ruling on\r\n    the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse\r\n    of discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to\r\n    the defendant.&nbsp; State v.\r\n    Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 586 (Ct. App. 2001); State v.\r\n    Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 538 S.E.2d 257 (Ct. App. 2000).&nbsp;\r\n    An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is\r\n    based on an error of law.&nbsp; State\r\n    v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 582 S.E.2d 426 (2003); State v. McDonald,\r\n    343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000).&nbsp;\r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Collection of Urine Sample&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Horton\r\n    maintains the results of the urine test should have been suppressed because\r\n    the urine sample was improperly collected.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    â€œBlood and urine samples must\r\n    be obtained by physicians licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners,\r\n    registered nurses licensed by the State Board of Nursing, and other medical\r\n    personnel trained to obtain the samples in a licensed medical facility.â€&nbsp;\r\n    S.C.

Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 2003).&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Horton\r\n    claims section 56-5-2950 was violated because Officer Joye was the\r\n    individual who collected the urine sample.&nbsp;\r\n    We find this argument is without merit.&nbsp;\r\n    Because there were no male nurses available that evening to\r\n    personally witness the production of the sample and immediately collect it,\r\n    Mobley followed hospital policy and did not accompany Horton into the\r\n    bathroom.&nbsp; However, while Mobley\r\n    did not stand next to Horton while he gave his sample, she observed the\r\n    situation from the partially open bathroom door.&nbsp;\r\n    The only role played by Officer Joye was to place a lid on the sample\r\n    and hand it to Mobley, who then signed the appropriate labels on the\r\n    container and sealed it.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    We\r\n    find the trial judge did not err in finding that, as Mobley was in the\r\n    â€œimmediate proximityâ€ of the test, the procedure followed was\r\n    appropriate under the circumstances.&nbsp;\r\n    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Chain of Custody\r\n    Horton avers the State failed to \r\n      prove a complete and proper chain of custody in regard to the urine sample.\r\n  The State must prove a chain\r\n  of custody for a urine sample from the time it is obtained until it is tested.&nbsp;\r\n  See State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 544 S.E.2d 835 (2001)\r\n  (case involving a blood sample); Ex parte Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n  Control, 350 S.C. 243, 565 S.E.2d 293 (2002).&nbsp;\r\n  A complete chain of evidence must be established as far as practicable,\r\n  tracing possession from the time the specimen is given to the final custodian\r\n  by whom it is analyzed.&nbsp; Carter,\r\n  344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837; State v.

Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 100 S.E.2d 534\r\n  (1957).&nbsp; Where the substance\r\n  analyzed has passed through several hands, the evidence must not leave it to\r\n  conjecture as to who had it and what was done with it between the taking and\r\n  the analysis.&nbsp; Benton, 232\r\n  S.C. at 33-34, 100 S.E.2d at 537.\r\n    Proof\r\n    of chain of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering but must\r\n    establish a complete chain of evidence as far as practicable.&nbsp;\r\n    Carter, 344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837; State v.\r\n    Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 376 S.E.2d 773 (1989); Benton, 232 S.C.\r\n    at 33, 100 S.E.2d at 537.&nbsp; In\r\n    applying this rule, our Supreme Court has found evidence inadmissible only\r\n    where there is a missing link in the chain of possession because the\r\n    identity of those who handled the specimen was not established at least as\r\n    far as practicable.&nbsp; Carter,\r\n    344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837.&nbsp; On\r\n    the other hand, where the identity of persons handling the specimen is\r\n    established, the Supreme Court has found that evidence regarding its care\r\n    goes only to the weight of the specimen as credible evidence.&nbsp;\r\n    Id.&nbsp; In other\r\n    words, where there is a weak link in the chain of custody, as opposed to a\r\n    missing link, the question is only one of credibility and not admissibility.&nbsp;\r\n    Id.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    In\r\n    his brief, Horton cites testimony by Officer Burgess and Sergeant Williford\r\n    in support of his contention that the State failed to adequately prove the\r\n    chain of custody of the urine sample.&nbsp; Officer\r\n    Burgess did not recall: (1) whether he received the urine sample from Mobley\r\n    or Officer Joye; (2) at what time he delivered the sample to the evidence\r\n    locker; and (3) whether he stored the sample in his home refrigerator until\r\n    he transported it to the evidence locker.&nbsp;\r\n    Horton points to testimony by Sergeant Williford that, when he\r\n    delivered the urine sample to SLED, the plastic container which held the\r\n    urine sample was inside a Styrofoam container.&nbsp;\r\n    Horton claims â€œ[t]here was no testimony as to how the plastic\r\n    container got into a styrofoam container.â€\r\n    Regardless, the identities of all persons handling\r\n    Hortonâ€™s urine sample were firmly established.&nbsp;\r\n    See Carter, 344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837.&nbsp; The persons who handled the evidence testified to a\r\n    sufficient chain of custody.&nbsp; The\r\n    State proved a continuous chain of custody through the testimony of all\r\n    people who had control and possession of the evidence.\r\n  There is no missing link in the chain of custody.Â  \r\n    The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding a complete chain of \r\n    custody and allowing the jury to consider the results of the urine test.\r\n   C.Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 403 Analysis\r\n    Horton\r\n    claims the results of the urine test were more prejudicial than probative\r\n    and should have been excluded by Rule 403, SCRE.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    &nbsp;â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\r\n    value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\r\n    confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of\r\n    undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\r\n    evidence.â€&nbsp; Rule 403, SCRE.&nbsp; A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative\r\n    probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only\r\n    in exceptional circumstances.&nbsp; State\r\n    v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp;\r\n    We review a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to\r\n    the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference\r\n    to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    The\r\n    toxicologistâ€™s report confirming the presence of alcohol, THC, opiate\r\n    derivatives, and cocaine metabolite in Hortonâ€™s urine was certainly\r\n    damaging to his case.&nbsp; However, we find this evidence was more probative than\r\n    prejudicial in nature.&nbsp; The test\r\n    results corroborate Officer Burgessâ€™s suspicion that, even though the\r\n    Datamaster registered a legal alcohol level, Horton was under the influence.&nbsp;\r\n    Furthermore, Horton was free to challenge the veracity of the test\r\n    results.&nbsp; In fact, Horton\r\n    advanced this argument at trial, eliciting testimony from two SLED\r\n    toxicologists that it was impossible to determine whether Horton was under\r\n    the influence of these drugs at the time of the accident.\r\n  Recently, the Court of Appeals, in Kennedy v. Griffin, \r\n    ___S.C.___, 593 S.E.2d 512 (Ct. App. 2004), analyzed the admissibility of \r\n    evidence of marijuana usage in an automobile collision scenario.Â  Kennedy \r\n    is inapposite to the facts of the case at bar.Â  Here, there is a definite \r\n    correlation between the ingestion of the drugs and alcohol and the toxicology \r\n    analysis.Â  In Kennedy, the evidence offered was inconclusive and indefinite \r\n    in regard to the impact on the individual ingesting the substance.Â  The test \r\n    results in this case corroborated Officer Burgessâ€™s observation of Horton.\r\n  The trial judge did not abuse his discretion \r\n    in allowing the admission of the results of Hortonâ€™s urine test.Â  The probative \r\n    nature of this evidence, especially when viewed in conjunction with Officer \r\n    Burgessâ€™s testimony, far outweighs any prejudice.Â  We note the admission of \r\n    the urine test did not restrict Hortonâ€™s ability to present an adequate defense, \r\n    as he was still able to attack the test results.\r\n  III.Â  Lack of Remorse/Constitutional Right to Remain Silent\r\n  Horton asserts the trial judge erred in\r\n  allowing the State to present evidence of Hortonâ€™s lack of remorse.&nbsp;\r\n  We disagree.\r\n  â€œAll relevant evidence is admissible, except \r\n    as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution \r\n    of the State of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, or by other rules promulgated \r\n    by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.â€Â  Rule 402, SCRE; State v. Aleksey, \r\n    343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000).Â  â€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ means evidence having \r\n    any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the \r\n    determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be \r\n    without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Under Rule 401, evidence is relevant \r\n    if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less \r\n    probable the matter in controversy.Â  In the Matter of the Care and Treatment \r\n    of Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003); State v. Adams, \r\n    354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n  The testimony in question\r\n  concerns the following remarks by Officer Burgess:\r\n    \r\n  During my conversations with him, as far as asking \r\n    phone numbers and things like that, insurance information, thatâ€™s all I was \r\n    getting from Mr. Horton, he sat there unemotional.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  He sat there unemotional, no response whatsoever.Â  His \r\n    attitude and behavior just didnâ€™t add up to [the] reality of what had just \r\n    happened.\r\n    \r\n  Horton frames the issue as an error \r\n    in regard to evidence that Horton lacked remorse.Â  However, Horton professes \r\n    that Officer Burgessâ€™ testimony was an improper comment on Hortonâ€™s right \r\n    to remain silent.Â  Citing State v. Reid, 324 S.C. 74, 476 S.E.2d 695 \r\n    (1996), overruled on other grounds by State v. Watson, 349 S.C. \r\n    372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002), Horton avers â€œthis line of questioning was a comment \r\n    on [Hortonâ€™s] lack of remorse and therefore improper.â€\r\n   Reid edifies:\r\n  It is a violation of due process for a State \r\n    to permit comment on a defendantâ€™s post-arrest silence since the giving of \r\n    Miranda warnings might induce silence by implicitly assuring a defendant \r\n    his silence will not be used against him.Â  Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. \r\n    610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976).Â  See also State v. Arther, \r\n    290 S.C. 291, 350 S.E.2d 187 (1986); State v.

App. 1985), cert. denied, 286 S.C. 127, 332 S.E.2d 533 (1985).Â  \r\n    References to a defendantâ€™s lack of remorse are also improper as violative \r\n    of a defendantâ€™s Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.Â  State \r\n    v. Diddlemeyer, 296 S.C. 235, 371 S.E.2d 793 (1988), overruled on other \r\n    grounds, State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991); \r\n    State v. Cockerham, 294 S.C. 380, 365 S.E.2d 22 (1988); State v. \r\n    Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987), cert. denied, 503 \r\n    U.S. 993, 112 S.Ct. 1691, 118 L.Ed.2d 404 (1992) (comments by the prosecution \r\n    upon an accusedâ€™s failure to express remorse invite jury to draw an adverse \r\n    inference merely because the defendant did not appear penitent); State \r\n    v. Sloan, 278 S.C. 435, 298 S.E.2d 92 (1982).Â  Here, the State was permitted \r\n    to inquire both as to Reidâ€™s post-arrest silence and his lack of remorse; \r\n    this inquiry was therefore clearly improper.\r\n  Id. at 78, 476 S.E.2d at 696.\r\n  Horton complains that the trial court \r\n    should have suppressed Officer Burgessâ€™ observation and description of Horton \r\n    at the accident scene.Â  Horton sat in Officer Burgessâ€™ patrol vehicle approximately \r\n    twenty to thirty minutes while the officer made an accident report.Â  The officer \r\n    noted a smell of alcohol about Hortonâ€™s person.Â  Horton appeared unemotional.Â  \r\n    Officer Burgess thought Horton was under the influence of something and arrested \r\n    him.Â  The State offered the officerâ€™s factual observations to support his \r\n    opinion and conclusion that Horton was under the influence.Â  â€œ[I]t is well \r\n    settled that a lay witness may testify whether or not in his opinion a person \r\n    was drunk or sober on a given occasion on which he observed him and that the \r\n    weight of such testimony is for determination by the jury.â€Â  State v. Ramey, \r\n    221 S.C. 10, 13-14, 68 S.E.2d 634, 635 (1952).\r\n  The testimony was not presented as evidence of Hortonâ€™s \r\n    lack of remorse or as a comment on Hortonâ€™s post-arrest silence.Â  Rather, \r\n    the testimony was presented for the purpose of illustrating Hortonâ€™s actions \r\n    and attitudes after the accident, and how his unemotional response to the \r\n    events led Officer Burgess to believe he was under the influence.Â  The challenged \r\n    testimony was clearly relevant and admissible to support the officerâ€™s decision \r\n    to have Horton submit to both a Datamaster and urine test.\r\n  Concomitantly, the \r\n    trial judge did not err in allowing Officer Burgessâ€™s testimony about Hortonâ€™s \r\n    attitude and behavior after the accident.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  Based on our review of the record, we come to \r\n    the ineluctable conclusion that the testimony of Officer Burgess is NOT \r\n    a comment upon post-arrest silence nor an impermissible comment on the defendantâ€™s \r\n    lack of remorse.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Based upon the foregoing, Hortonâ€™s \r\n    conviction and sentence for reckless homicide are\r\n   AFFIRMED.\r\n  HEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3788","title":"Gene Frye Bail Bonds v.

Barber, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3788\r\nSubmitted April 6, 2004 â€“ Filed May \r\n  3, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRobert T. Williams, of Lexington, for Appellant. \r\nNo Appearance by Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this case, we must decide \r\n  whether the circuit court can order a bail bond company to return a portion \r\n  of the money it collected from the defendantâ€™s family when the company is relieved \r\n  as surety on a criminal bond.Â  We hold the court may not issue such an order. \r\n  [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nRobert Husted was arrested in Lexington \r\n  County and charged with several general sessions court offenses.Â  Gene Frye \r\n  Bail Bonds (GFB) acted as surety on a $60,100 bond and Husted was released from \r\n  jail.Â  Following Hustedâ€™s arrest on additional charges and his failure to make \r\n  a court appearance, GFB requested to be released as surety.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on the motion, GFB \r\n  asserted Hustedâ€™s father asked to be relieved of his obligations as the bondâ€™s \r\n  guarantor.Â  The court asked GFB to reappear the next morning with Hustedâ€™s \r\n  father to determine the amount already paid on the bond.Â  Following the \r\n  second hearing, the court released GFB from further obligations on the bond \r\n  but required it to return $4500 of the $6000 fee it had received from Hustedâ€™s \r\n  father.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGFB contends the circuit court erred by requiring it to repay \r\n  a portion of its previously collected fee to Hustedâ€™s father.Â  We agree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-50 establishes the procedure \r\n  to be followed when a surety seeks to be relieved from a bond:\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (A)Â Â Â  A surety desiring to be relieved on a bond \r\n  for â€œgood causeâ€ or the nonpayment of fees shall file with the court a motion \r\n  to be relieved on the bond.Â  A copy of the motion must be served upon the defendant, \r\n  his attorney, and the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  The court shall then schedule a hearing \r\n  to determine if the surety should be relieved on the bond and advise all parties \r\n  of the hearing date.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (B)Â Â Â  If the circumstances warrant immediate incarceration \r\n  of the defendant to prevent imminent violation of any one of the specific terms \r\n  of the bail bond, or if the defendant has violated any one of the specific terms \r\n  of the bond, the surety may take the defendant to the appropriate detention \r\n  facility for holding until the court orders that the surety be relieved.Â  The \r\n  surety must immediately file with the detention facility and the court an affidavit \r\n  stating the facts to support the surrender of the defendant for good cause or \r\n  the nonpayment of fees. When the affidavit is filed with the court, the surety \r\n  must also file a motion to be relieved on the bond pursuant to subsection (A).Â  \r\n  A surety who surrenders a defendant and files an affidavit which does not show \r\n  good cause or the nonpayment of fees is subject to penalties imposed for perjury \r\n  as provided for in Article 1, Chapter 9 of Title 16.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-50 (2002). \r\nThis version of section 38-53-50 became effective \r\n  in 1998.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-50 (2002) (history); see also \r\n  Act No. 425, 1998 S.C. Acts 3134, 3138.Â  Prior to the 1998 amendments, section \r\n  38-53-50(B) further provided the circuit court â€œmay order the surety to refund \r\n  to the defendant any fees paid toward the bail bond after deducting the suretyâ€™s \r\n  actual costs, reasonable expenses, and reasonable fees, as determined by the \r\n  court.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-50(B) (Supp. 1997).Â  However, when \r\n  section 38-53-50 was revised in 1998, this provision was deleted and the circuit \r\n  court was granted no similar authority.\r\nClearly, section 38-53-50 gives the circuit court \r\n  discretion in determining whether a surety should be relieved from a bond.Â Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-50(A) (After a surety files a motion to be \r\n  relieved on a bond, â€œ[t]he court shall then schedule a hearing to determine \r\n  if the surety should be relieved on the bond.â€) (emphasis added).Â  However, \r\n  nothing in the statute vests the court with the discretion to require the surety \r\n  return any portion of the fee the defendant paid for the bond.Â  Although the \r\n  circuit court previously had the power to require a return to the defendant \r\n  of a portion of the fee, that authority did not survive the 1998 amendment to \r\n  section 38-53-50.\r\nWe conclude the governing statute does not authorize \r\n  the circuit court to require a bonding company to pay any portion of the fee \r\n  back to the defendant or his guarantor in order to be released from a bond.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the challenged portion of the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\n REVERSED.\r\n HUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3789","title":"Upchurch v.

Upchurch (â€œWifeâ€) seeking tuition and child \r\n  support payments.Â  The family court granted Husbandâ€™s request for child support, \r\n  ordering Wife to pay it retroactive to the filing of the summons and complaint.Â  \r\n  We find this court is without jurisdiction to review this case because the notice \r\n  of appeal was not timely served.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife were married in March \r\n  1981. They had three children, Sloane G. Upchurch, born September 19, 1984, \r\n  Michael O. Upchurch, born October 25, 1985, and Catherine Ellis Upchurch, born \r\n  May 29, 1989.Â  Husband and Wife subsequently divorced on February 3, 2001.\r\nAt the time of their divorce, they had entered \r\n  into a separation agreement, which was incorporated into the final divorce decree \r\n  of February 3, 2001.Â  Pursuant to the decree, Husband and Wife were awarded \r\n  joint custody of the three children, with Husband serving as the primary custodial \r\n  parent subject to Wifeâ€™s right to reasonable visitation.Â  With regard to child \r\n  support, the decree ordered: â€œDue to the current financial situation of the \r\n  parties, including the wifeâ€™s establishment of a new household in Charleston, \r\n  South Carolina, the husband waives child support.Â  The husband and wife may \r\n  decide to revisit the issue of child support should the financial situation \r\n  of either party change drastically.â€\r\nIn September 2001, Husband brought the present \r\n  action requesting that the family court order Wife to pay private school tuition \r\n  and child support.Â  At the hearing, Husband testified there had been a dramatic \r\n  change in his financial circumstances.Â  He claimed that his oldest daughter \r\n  would be attending college soon, giving rise to substantial tuition and related \r\n  expenses.Â  Husband also testified that medical expenses for the children had \r\n  increased due to injuries that were not covered by insurance and orthodontic \r\n  treatment required for all three children.Â  Wife did not object to this testimony.Â  \r\n  The only objection she raised concerned testimony regarding Husbandâ€™s payment \r\n  of their oldest daughterâ€™s college expenses, which would occur after the daughter \r\n  had reached eighteen. \r\nWifeâ€™s circumstances had also changed since the \r\n  divorce.Â  At the time of the original divorce decree, she had just purchased \r\n  her own home in Charleston and had incurred substantial expense in establishing \r\n  a new household there.Â  Wife, however, subsequently sold her new home and moved \r\n  to Savannah, Georgia.Â  She received $31,000 profit from the sale.\r\nThe family court concluded Husband was entitled \r\n  to receive child support.Â  In its ruling, the court observed that because Wife \r\n  had sold her home in Charleston and was no longer established in a new household, \r\n  â€œ[t]he reason for waiving support no longer existed.â€Â  In determining the amount \r\n  of child support owed, the court opined that it would apply the Child Support \r\n  Guidelines, using financial declarations submitted by Husband and Wife.Â  In \r\n  setting the amount, the court noted Wife was currently unemployed but was receiving \r\n  income from a severance package with her previous employer.Â  The court found, \r\n  because Wife held a masterâ€™s degree, it was appropriate to impute to her a monthly \r\n  income of $3,600.Â  Based on these facts, the family court awarded Husband child \r\n  support retroactive to the time he commenced the present action.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has \r\n  authority to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996); Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, \r\n  160 (1992); Charest v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511, 515, 495 S.E.2d 784, 786 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to \r\n  disregard the findings of the court below.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 \r\n  S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the trial judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Â McAlister \r\n  v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, 483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982); Cherry v. \r\n  Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Kisling v. \r\n  Allison, 343 S.C. 674, 677, 541 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs a threshold matter, Husband argues \r\n  this court lacks jurisdiction to review this case because Wifeâ€™s notice of appeal \r\n  was not timely served.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder the South Carolina Appellate Court \r\n  Rules, a notice of appeal from a domestic relations action â€œshall be served \r\n  on all respondents within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of \r\n  entry of the order or judgment.â€Â  Rule 203(b)(1) &amp; (3), SCACR.Â  An order \r\n  becomes effective once the judge delivers it to the clerk of court.Â  See \r\n  Bayne v. Bass, 302 S.C. 208, 209, 394 S.E.2d 726, 727 (Ct. App. 1990) \r\n  (holding that until a ruling is reduced to writing, signed by the judge, and \r\n  delivered for recordation it is not binding on the parties).Â  â€œThe recording \r\n  of the judgment or order is only to give notice and secure the safety of the \r\n  record of the solemn acts of the courts.â€Â  Genobles v. West, 23 S.C. \r\n  154, 160 (1885).Â  â€œAny notice in writing which would convey to a losing party \r\n  that judgment has been entered [i]s sufficient.â€Â  Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood \r\n  v. Hiller, 307 S.C. 331, 335, 415 S.E.2d 117, 119 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œA person \r\n  who knows of a thing has notice thereof.Â  Stated differently, â€˜[n]o one needs \r\n  notice of what he already knows.â€™â€Â  Hannah v. United Refrigerated Servs., \r\n  312 S.C. 42, 47, 430 S.E.2d 539, 541 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Actual notice is synonymous \r\n  with knowledge.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 \r\n  S.C. 54, 63 n. 6, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 n. 6 (1998).Â  â€œNotice is regarded as actual \r\n  where the person sought to be charged therewith either knows of the existence \r\n  of the particular facts in question or is conscious of having the means of knowing \r\n  it, even though such means may not be employed by him.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the presiding family court \r\n  judge signed the order under appeal on May 30, 2002.Â  The following day on May \r\n  31, 2002, the judgeâ€™s administrative assistant mailed the original signed order \r\n  to the Colleton County Clerk of Court.Â  The cover letter enclosed with the order \r\n  asked the clerk to file the order and forward copies to the partiesâ€™ attorneys \r\n  of record.Â  The judgeâ€™s administrative assistant also carbon copied both attorneys \r\n  of record and included a copy of the family courtâ€™s signed order.Â  By letter \r\n  dated August 23, 2002, Wifeâ€™s attorney acknowledged receiving the copy of the \r\n  signed order from the judgeâ€™s administrative assistant, but noted that he did \r\n  not consider the signed and dated, but as yet unfiled, copy of the order sufficient \r\n  notice of its entry.\r\nWe find the letter and accompanying copy \r\n  of the signed order from the family court judgeâ€™s administrative assistant was \r\n  sufficient â€œwritten notice of entry of the order or judgmentâ€ to begin tolling \r\n  the thirty-day time limit for appeal under Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  Though our \r\n  courts have not addressed the question of when notice of written entry of judgment \r\n  has occurred under Rule 203(b)(1), this Court has addressed the application \r\n  of a similar notice requirement in Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood v. Hiller.\r\nIn Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood, the \r\n  plaintiff law firm sued one of its former clients for unpaid attorney fees.Â  \r\n  Prior to trial, the defendant moved for change of venue.Â  After the defendant \r\n  failed to appear at the call of the motions calendar, the chief administrative \r\n  judge issued an order holding the change of venue motion had been abandoned, \r\n  stricken, and denied.Â  Id. at 332, 415 S.E.2d at 117.Â  The law firm mailed \r\n  a letter to defendantâ€™s counsel enclosing an unsigned, undated, and unfiled \r\n  copy of the order.Â  Id. at 332-33, 415 S.E.2d at 117.Â  The defendantâ€™s \r\n  attorney responded by letter in which he acknowledged receipt of the order, \r\n  but noted that he did not consider the unsigned order sufficient notice of its \r\n  entry.Â  Id. at 333, 415 S.E.2d at 117.Â  This court disagreed, finding \r\n  the letter and unsigned, undated order provided sufficient notice that the order \r\n  had been signed and entered.Â  Id. at 335, 415 S.E.2d at 119.\r\nIn the present case, the notice provided \r\n  to Wifeâ€™s attorney was more substantial than that which was deemed minimally \r\n  sufficient in Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood.Â  Here, unlike the situation \r\n  in Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood, Wifeâ€™s attorney received a copy of the \r\n  signed and dated order that was entered by the family court judge.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the letter and order were received directly from the judgeâ€™s chambers, not from \r\n  opposing counsel or other party.Â  We discern no reason why the rationale this \r\n  court followed in Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood does not compel a similar \r\n  result in the instant case.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe find the notice of appeal in this case was not \r\n  timely served.Â  The present appeal is therefore\r\n DISMISSED.\r\n HEARN, C.J. and BEATTY, J., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3790","title":"State v, Reese","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=3790","description":"In this criminal appeal, the court reversed a murder conviction of Reese because: (1) the trial court failed to charge the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter; and (2) the solicitor's closing argument was improper and prejudicial.","date":"2004-05-03","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-indent:.5in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyText2\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent2\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-indent:.5in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoBlockText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.documentbody1\r\n\t{}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThe State,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWillie Earl Reese, Jr.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Richland County\r\nG.

Zelenka, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, and Solicitor Warren \r\n  Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Appellant Willie Earl Reese, \r\n  Jr. was indicted and charged with the murder of his wife Teresa.Â  Following \r\n  a jury trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to thirty-five years in prison.Â  \r\n  He now appeals, asserting the trial court erred in the admission of hearsay \r\n  testimony, the admission of photographs of the victimâ€™s body and autopsy, denying \r\n  certain requested jury charges, and failing to grant a mistrial based on the \r\n  Solicitorâ€™s closing arguments.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFollowing her marriage to Reese in January \r\n  1999, Teresa Joyner moved out of the marital house and returned to her parentsâ€™ \r\n  home on two occasions, the first in January 2001 and again in April of the same \r\n  year.Â  Late in the evening during her second stay away from the marital home, \r\n  as Teresa stood on the sidewalk in front of her parentsâ€™ house, Reese shot Teresa \r\n  in the head, killing her.\r\nDuring the evening leading up to the fatal \r\n  shooting, Teresa had been playing softball with her neighbor and cousin, Edith \r\n  McKenzie.Â  After the game, the two went to a club.Â  Throughout the evening, \r\n  while Teresa was with Edith, Teresaâ€™s mother received repeated telephone calls \r\n  from Reese inquiring about Teresaâ€™s whereabouts and asking that she call him \r\n  when she returned home.Â  Each time he called, Teresaâ€™s mother assured Reese \r\n  that she would tell her daughter he had called.\r\nEdith testified that after leaving the \r\n  club with Teresa around 1:30 a.m., she noticed Reeseâ€™s car parked at a stop \r\n  sign as she pulled into Sandstone Lane.Â  Pulling alongside his car, Teresa spoke \r\n  briefly with Reese, after which he turned his car around and followed Teresa \r\n  to her parentsâ€™ house.Â  Standing in front of her parentsâ€™ house, Teresa assured \r\n  Edith that everything was okay, gave her a hug, and told her that she would \r\n  see her tomorrow.Â  Edith then departed, leaving Teresa and Reese standing on \r\n  the sidewalk facing each other.\r\nEdith drove to her own home two houses \r\n  away, and once inside, called to check on Teresa.Â  Teresaâ€™s mother answered \r\n  the phone, and Edith asked if Teresa had come inside.Â  According to Edithâ€™s \r\n  testimony, when Teresaâ€™s mother went outside to check, she began screaming.Â  \r\n  Edith then drove back to where she had left Teresa and found her body on the \r\n  sidewalk.\r\nThe following day, using his father as \r\n  an intermediary, Reese contacted the police and informed them he wanted to turn \r\n  himself in.Â  Deputy Thomas Reese, the officer who took Reese into custody, testified \r\n  that Reese was upset, at times crying, and cooperative throughout the process.Â  \r\n  At the sheriffâ€™s office, Reese gave the following voluntary written statement:\r\n\r\nI didnâ€™t go there to kill my wife.Â  I went to talk to her.Â  \r\n  When she pulled up she said to follow her to the house, so I did.Â  We were right \r\n  there on the sidewalk talking.Â  I said hello to [Edith] and she drove home.Â  \r\n  We talked for a few minutes.Â  I was upset and crying.Â  I pulled the gun out \r\n  and told her that I was going to kill myself.Â  She was trying to tell me not \r\n  to kill myself.Â  I kept asking, â€œWhy does it got to be like this, baby?â€Â  I \r\n  was moving the gun back and forth as a reaction.Â  I donâ€™t know why the gun went \r\n  off.Â  I thought both safeties were on.Â  I just wanted to see how she would react \r\n  when I told her I was going to kill myself.Â  I didnâ€™t mean to shoot her.\r\nWhen the gun went off I put my hands on my head.Â  \r\n  I panicked.Â  I went to my car and put the gun to my head.Â  I decided to call \r\n  my dad.Â  He talked me out of killing myself.Â  I went to my auntâ€™s house and \r\n  parked the car.Â  I walked to my dadâ€™s house.Â  He told me to please put the gun \r\n  down.Â  I ended up putting the gun in the tire in the boat in the backyard where \r\n  I told you all it was and itâ€™s the same one you recovered.Â  My sister had called \r\n  Tasha to bring the kids over because I was thinking about killing myself.Â  My \r\n  dad calmed me down and rode me around.Â  Then I turned myself in over at Deputy \r\n  Reeseâ€™s house where you picked me up.\r\n\r\nAt trial, three witnesses testified that \r\n  Teresa had moved out because of marital difficulties she was having with Reese.Â  \r\n  On each occasion, counsel for Reese objected that the portion of the testimony \r\n  relating to why she moved out was hearsay because they â€œcould only know that \r\n  through hearsay.â€Â  The objections were overruled.Â  Over Reeseâ€™s objection, four \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s witnesses testified that during the week prior to her shooting, \r\n  Teresa had told them that she was afraid for her life.Â  Over objection, the \r\n  State admitted into evidence Exhibit 13, a photograph of Teresaâ€™s body at the \r\n  scene, and Exhibit 19, an autopsy photo.\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, \r\n  counsel for Reese requested that the jury be instructed on the law of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter and accident.Â  The State objected, arguing that the felony of pointing \r\n  and presenting a firearm was involved, thereby leaving Reese ineligible for \r\n  jury instructions on involuntary manslaughter and accident.Â  Whether or not \r\n  the felony was implicated, counsel for Reese responded, the evidence did not \r\n  necessarily establish the elements of the crime and â€œthe jury could conclude \r\n  that he was not pointing or presenting.â€Â  The trial court sustained the Stateâ€™s \r\n  objection, ruling that Reese was not entitled to involuntary manslaughter and \r\n  accident charges.\r\nAt the beginning of his closing argument, \r\n  the Solicitor noted the presence of counsel for Reese and explained his role \r\n  as an advocate.Â  He then asked the jury, â€œWho speaks for Teresa Reese? Â In this \r\n  system of justice that we have in this type of case who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  \r\n  That is the question that has been asked since April 29th, I submit to you, \r\n  of this year, since the day she died.â€Â  The Solicitor reiterated the question, \r\n  â€œMadam Forelady and Gentlemen, the question is:Â  Who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  \r\n  And I submit to that that question can be answered and will be answered today.â€Â  \r\n  The Solicitor argued:\r\n\r\nAfter you have seen all of the evidence â€“ you notice I didnâ€™t \r\n  answer the question before I went over the evidence with you.Â  I have now gone \r\n  over all of the evidence with you.Â  And this is argument.Â  And you have seen \r\n  all of the evidence of malice that the State submits to you we have proven.Â  \r\n  So now I ask you, now that all the evidence is in upon my argument, who speaks \r\n  for Teresa Reese?Â  You do, Madam Forelady and Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury.\r\n\r\nThe Solicitor then concluded, â€œYou can speak for \r\n  her with your verdict.Â  Because the truth is that she was murdered.Â  The facts \r\n  are there and youâ€™re going to hear the law.Â  And so you, the State submits, \r\n  will speak for her with your verdict, with your verdict.â€ \r\nCounsel for Reese twice objected to the Solicitorâ€™s \r\n  closing argument and moved for a mistrial.Â  The trial judge denied Reeseâ€™s motion, \r\n  explaining, â€œAll right, sir.Â  It may be close, but Iâ€™ll overrule your motion \r\n  Mr. Swerling.â€Â  When counsel for Reese requested a curative instruction, the \r\n  trial judge responded, â€œIâ€™ve already ruled.Â  I overruled his objection.Â  I canâ€™t \r\n  very well give a curative instruction if I were to believe that your final argument \r\n  was beyond the bounds of what is allowed by law.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  SOLICITORâ€™S CLOSING ARGUMENT\r\nThe following colloquy occurred during \r\n  the Solicitorâ€™s closing argument:\r\n\r\nMR. GASSER:Â Â Â Â  Who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  In this system \r\n  of justice that we have in this type of case, who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  \r\n  That is the question that has been asked since April the 29th, I \r\n  submit to you, of this year, since the day she died.\r\nFrom the time that Willie Earl Reese was arrested, \r\n  the time that he initially appeared in court, through the Grand Jury proceedings, \r\n  when he was placed on the trial docket, when his case was called on Monday, \r\n  when you jurors with your fellow jurors assembled downstairs before Judge Manning, \r\n  during the process of you being selected for this case, from opening statements \r\n  of Ms. Campbell and Mr. Swerling through the presentation of the testimony and \r\n  the submission of evidence, through the closing remarks of Ms. Campbell and \r\n  Mr. Swerling and as I stand before you, Madam Forelady and Ladies and Gentlemen, \r\n  the question is:Â  Who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  And I submit to you that that \r\n  question can be answered and will be answered today.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nMs. Campbell told you, the last line of her opening \r\n  statement Ms. Campbell told you that this case is about holding Willie Reese, \r\n  Jr. responsible for the choices he made on April the 29th.Â  So I \r\n  ask you again:Â  Who speaks for Teresa Reese?\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Judge, I have to object.Â  I donâ€™t like to do \r\n  it, but I have to object to this line of argument.Â  I donâ€™t think itâ€™s proper \r\n  and Iâ€™d like to make a motion on it.Â  I can either do it after Mr. Gasser is \r\n  done.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  But it is closing argument.Â  But I object to \r\n  this line of argument.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right, sir.\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  I have a motion.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Overruled.Â  Go ahead.\r\nMR. GASSER:Â  Thank you, Your Honor.Â  After you have seen all \r\n  of the evidenceâ€”you notice I didnâ€™t answer that question before I went over \r\n  the evidence with you.Â  I have now gone over all of the evidence with you.Â  \r\n  And this is argument.Â  And you have seen all of the evidence of malice that \r\n  the State submits to you we have proven.Â  So now I ask you, now that all the \r\n  evidence is in upon my argument, who speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  You do, Madam \r\n  Forelady and Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury.\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Again, Your Honor, for the same reasons.\r\nMR. GASSER:Â  You do.Â  You speak for her.\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Iâ€™d like to be heard on that issue.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Yes, sir.Â  Iâ€™ll hear you.\r\nMR. GASSER:Â  You can speak for her with your verdict.Â  Because \r\n  the truth is that she was murdered.Â  The facts are there, and youâ€™re going to \r\n  hear the law.Â  And so you, the State submits, will speak for her with your verdict, \r\n  with your verdict.\r\nShe had the right to leave him and she had the right \r\n  to not be afraid.Â  She had the right to live.Â  That was her choice.Â  Willie \r\n  Earl Reeseâ€™s choice that morning, he chose death.Â  Now, you canâ€™t do anything \r\n  about that.Â  But when your verdict speaks the truth when you convict him of \r\n  murder, it will be justice.Â  And justice, Madam Forelady, and Ladies and Gentlemen, \r\n  justice is what each and every one of you represent here today.\r\n\r\nAfter the Solicitorâ€™s closing argument, the judge charged \r\n  the jury.Â  Once the jury retired to the jury room, the judge heard Mr. Swerlingâ€™s \r\n  motion:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Mr. Swerling, Iâ€™ll hear your motion first.\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Yes, sir.Â  During the argument I objected twice \r\n  to Mr. Gasserâ€™s statements to the jury reluctantly.Â  But I think that those \r\n  kind of remarks exceed the bounds of permissible argument.Â  The juryâ€™s responsibility \r\n  is to speak the truth, to render a verdict on the law and the evidence, not \r\n  to speak for the victim in the case.Â  Theyâ€™re not supposed to speak for anyone \r\n  except to speak the truth.\r\nMr. Gasser personalized the issue to the jury by \r\n  suggesting they were speaking for Ms. Joyner, made their responsibility personal \r\n  rather than as a jury to decide the issue from the facts and evidence and injected \r\n  I think into the trial and to the jury an inflammation and a passion to decide \r\n  this case for some other reason other than the facts and the law.Â  So, based \r\n  on it, Judge, I object and I move for a mistrial.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Mr. Gasser.\r\nMR. GASSER:Â  Your Honor, I couched it.Â  Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t \r\n  answer that question.Â  Mr. Swerling is the one who told the jury that we were \r\n  advocates and we were arguing a position and thatâ€”I had specifically waited \r\n  to the end of my argument after Iâ€™d gone over all of the evidence.Â  And I was \r\n  arguing them, which I am entitled to, that the evidence clearly shows that heâ€™s \r\n  guilty and Iâ€™m asking them for a verdict of guilt, and Iâ€™m merely telling them \r\n  when theyâ€”our position is when theyâ€”the evidence is that he is guilty and when \r\n  they signâ€”theyâ€™ll all vote guilty which weâ€™re asking them to do because we are \r\n  advocates, Mr. Swerling is asking them to find him not guilty, that when they \r\n  all agree that he is guilty that their agreement and then the foreladyâ€™s signature \r\n  speaks on behalf of Ms. Reese.Â  But I waited to do that towards the end.Â  It \r\n  was an argument that Iâ€™ve seen made on numerous occasions and that Iâ€™ve made \r\n  before.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right, sir.Â  It may be close, but Iâ€™ll overrule \r\n  your motion, Mr. Swerling.\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Would you issue at least a curative instruction \r\n  to the jury they are to disregard those remarks by Mr. Gasser?\r\nMR. GASSER:Â  Your Honor, I donâ€™t understand why one side can \r\n  passionately argue a position and why the other side canâ€™t.Â  I donâ€™t know how \r\n  many times he used the word Mr. Reese, Mr. Reese and Willie Reese, and developed \r\n  the principles and foundations of the Constitution, which is permissible, just \r\n  as what I have done.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Iâ€™ve already ruled.Â  I overruled his objection.Â  \r\n  I canâ€™t very well give a curative instruction if I were to believe that your \r\n  final argument was beyond the bounds of what is allowed by the law.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nMR. SWERLING:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nA review of a solicitorâ€™s closing argument is based upon \r\n  the standard of whether his comments so infected the trial with unfairness as \r\n  to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  State v. Caldwell, \r\n  300 S.C. 494, 504, 388 S.E.2d 816, 822 (1990).Â  The appropriateness of a solicitorâ€™s \r\n  closing argument is a matter left to the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  State \r\n  v. Rudd, 355 S.C. 543, 548, 586 S.E.2d 153, 156 (Ct. App. 2003); State \r\n  v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 160, 561 S.E.2d 640, 649 (Ct. App. 2002); State \r\n  v. Sweet, 342 S.C. 342, 347, 536 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A trial \r\n  judge is allowed broad discretion in dealing with the range and propriety of \r\n  closing arguments to the jury.Â  State v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 114-15, \r\n  456 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1995); State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 33, 393 S.E.2d \r\n  364, 372 (1990); State v. Woomer, 278 S.C. 468, 474, 299 S.E.2d 317, \r\n  320 (1982).Â  An appellate court will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding \r\n  closing argument unless there is an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Copeland, \r\n  321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996); State v. Jernigan, 156 \r\n  S.C. 509, 524, 153 S.E. 480, 486 (1930).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. Foster, \r\n  354 S.C. 614, 621, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. McDonald, \r\n  343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. \r\n  361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793-94 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  To warrant reversal, the \r\n  appellant must prove both abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice.Â  State \r\n  v. Sierra, 337 S.C. 368, 373, 523 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nâ€œA solicitorâ€™s closing argument must not appeal to the personal \r\n  biases of the jurors nor be calculated to arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or prejudices, \r\n  and its content should stay within the record and reasonable inferences to it.â€Â  \r\n  Humphries v. State, 351 S.C. 362, 373, 570 S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002); accord \r\n  Simmons v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998); see \r\n  also State v.

Linder, 276 S.C. 304, \r\n  312, 278 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981) (holding that because the solicitorâ€™s duty is \r\n  not to convict the defendant but to see justice done, the solicitorâ€™s closing \r\n  argument must be â€œcarefully tailoredâ€ to not appeal to personal bias of juror \r\n  nor calculated to arouse his passion or prejudiceâ€); State v. Rudd, 355 \r\n  S.C. 543, 548, 586 S.E.2d 153, 156 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œA solicitorâ€™s closing argument \r\n  must be carefully tailored so it does not appeal to the personal biases of the \r\n  jurors.â€).\r\nSpecifically, the solicitor asking the jurors to put themselves \r\n  in the place of the victim is improper and constitutes reversible error.Â  State \r\n  v. McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 38, 462 S.E.2d 882, 884 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  This \r\n  is known as the Golden Rule Argument.Â  The Golden Rule Argument â€œask[s] the \r\n  jurors to become advocates for the plaintiff or victim and to ignore their obligation \r\n  to exercise calm and reasonable judgment.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 700 (7th \r\n  ed. 1999); see also John W. Reis, Improper Jury Argument: Gilding \r\n  the Lustre of the Golden Rule, 69-JAN Fla. B.J. 60, 60 (1995) (â€œThe traditional \r\n  notion of the Golden Rule, though not contained in any rule of evidence or procedure, \r\n  holds that a lawyer shall not urge the jury members, either in a civil or criminal \r\n  case, to imagine themselves or their family members or friends in the place \r\n  of the offended litigant or victim and to render their verdict from that perspective.â€).Â  \r\n  Although the forbiddance of Golden Rule Arguments began in civil trials to hinder \r\n  the plaintiff from urging the jury to put itself in the place of the victim \r\n  in order to obtain higher damages, the prohibition has now been made applicable \r\n  to criminal actions.Â  75A Am.Jur.2d Trial Â§ 650 (1991); see Lucas \r\n  v. State, 335 So.2d 566, 568 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976) (holding that â€œ[t]he \r\n  technique of asking jurors to place themselves in the position of the victim \r\n  has been held to be improper in both criminal and civil casesâ€). \r\nâ€œThe â€˜Golden Ruleâ€™ argument, suggesting to jurors as it does \r\n  that they put themselves in the shoes of one of the parties, is generally impermissible \r\n  because it encourages the jurors to depart from neutrality and to decide the \r\n  case on the basis of personal interest and bias rather than on the evidence.â€Â  \r\n  75A Am.Jur.2d Trial Â§650 (1991).Â  Regardless of the nomenclature used, \r\n  any argument that importunes the jurors to places themselves in the victimâ€™s \r\n  shoes is disallowed Golden Rule Argument.Â  Johnson v. State, 587 S.E.2d \r\n  775, 781 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nGolden Rule Arguments are generally improper and may constitute \r\n  reversible error.Â  State v. McHenry, 78 P.3d 403, 410 (Kan. 2003); see \r\n  also State v. Prevatte, 570 S.E.2d 440, 476 (N.C. 2002) (â€œArguments \r\n  that ask the jurors to place themselves in the victimâ€™s shoes are improper.â€); \r\n  Velocity Express Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Hugen, 585 S.E.2d 557, 565 (Va. \r\n  2003) (ruling â€œplaintiffâ€™s repeated requests to the jury that it apply the â€˜Golden \r\n  Ruleâ€™ were prejudicial and constitute[d] reversible errorâ€).\r\nDuring the Solicitorâ€™s closing arguments, Mr. Swerling immediately \r\n  objected once the Solicitor posed the question to the jury, â€œWho speaks for \r\n  Teresa Reese?â€Â  The judge overruled the motion.Â  After the Solicitorâ€™s closing \r\n  remarks included â€œ[w]ho speaks for Teresa Reese?Â  You do, Madam Forelady and \r\n  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury,â€ Mr. Swerling again objected.Â  The court heard \r\n  Mr. Swerlingâ€™s motion after the judge charged the jury and they were in the \r\n  jury room.Â  Mr. Swerling initially moved for a mistrial based upon the passion-invoked \r\n  closing argument.Â  The judge overruled his motion.Â  Mr. Swerling then asked \r\n  the judge for a curative instruction to the jury to disregard the remarks made \r\n  by the Solicitor.Â  The judge denied the motion by stating, â€œIâ€™ve already ruled.â€\r\nAlthough a judge is given wide discretion in regard to closing \r\n  arguments, the judge irrefutably abused his discretion when he allowed the Solicitor \r\n  to continue the argument in his closing statement that aroused the passions \r\n  or prejudices of the jury.Â  This was impermissible Golden Rule Argument that \r\n  asked the jurors to become advocates for the victim by speaking for her instead \r\n  of maintaining their neutral role as jurors.Â  Because the judge did not give \r\n  a curative instruction after Mr. Swerling requested it, the trial judgeâ€™s abuse \r\n  of discretion resulted in prejudice to Reese.Â  We rule the improper jury argument \r\n  was prejudicial requiring a reversal of the jury verdict.\r\nII.Â  INVOLUNTARY \r\n  MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE\r\nThe Solicitor published the following \r\n  STATEMENT that Reese gave to Sergeant Barnes:\r\n\r\nI didnâ€™t go there to kill my wife.Â  I went there to talk \r\n  to her.Â  When she pulled up she said to follow her to the house, so I did.Â  \r\n  We were right there on the sidewalk talking.Â  I said hello to Nel and she drove \r\n  home.Â  We talked for a few minutes.Â  I was upset and crying.Â  I pulled the gun \r\n  out and told her I was going to kill myself.Â  She was trying to tell me not \r\n  to kill myself.Â  I kept asking, â€œwhy does it got to be like this, baby?â€Â  I \r\n  WAS MOVING THE GUN BACK AND FORTH AS A REACTION.Â  I DONâ€™T KNOW WHY THE GUN WENT \r\n  OFF.Â  I THOUGHT BOTH SAFETIES WERE ON.Â  I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD REACT \r\n  WHEN I TOLD HER I WAS GOING TO KILL MYSELF.Â  I DIDNâ€™T MEAN TO SHOOT HER.Â  WHEN \r\n  THE GUN WENT OFF I PUT MY HANDS ON MY HEAD.Â  I PANICKED.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe law to be charged must be determined \r\n  from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v.

Crosby, the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court held that the evidence presented at trial warranted a jury instruction \r\n  on involuntary manslaughter.Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\nA defendant is, however, entitled to a charge on involuntary \r\n  manslaughter where the evidence shows a reckless disregard of the safety of \r\n  others.Â  (citation omitted)\r\n. . . .\r\nThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence \r\n  presented at trial.Â  State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 525 S.E.2d 511 (2000).Â  \r\n  A trial court should refuse to charge a lesser-included offense only where there \r\n  is no evidence the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.Â  \r\n  Involuntary manslaughter is (1) the unintentional killing of another without \r\n  malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause \r\n  death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without \r\n  malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety \r\n  of others.Â  State v. Chatham, 336 S.C. 149, 519 S.E.2d 100 (1999).Â  To \r\n  constitute involuntary manslaughter, there must be a finding of criminal negligence, \r\n  statutorily defined as a reckless disregard of the safety of others.Â  Casey \r\n  v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-60 \r\n  (1985).Â  In State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999), this \r\n  Court held that a person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession \r\n  of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm himself in self-defense at the time of \r\n  the shooting.Â  In Burriss, the defendant was threatened and then attacked \r\n  by the victim and another male.Â  After being pushed to the ground, the defendant \r\n  drew a gun and fired two rounds into the ground.Â  One attacker backed away, \r\n  but urged his accompliceâ€”the victimâ€”to attack the defendant again. At this point, \r\n  the defendant was on the ground, separated from his gun.Â  When the victim began \r\n  moving threateningly toward Burriss, he snatched his gun up and it fired.Â  Burriss \r\n  stated he was scared and his hand was shaking when the gun went off: â€œIt was \r\n  an accident.Â  I didnâ€™t try to shoot nobody.â€Â  Burriss, 334 S.C. at 263, \r\n  513 S.E.2d at 108.Â  At one point, however, Burriss also testified that â€œmy hand \r\n  was on the trigger.Â  The trigger was pulled or whatever.â€\r\n. . . .\r\n. . . In his statement to police immediately \r\n  after the shooting, Crosby stated, â€œI closed my eyes and pulled the trigger.Â  \r\n  I didnâ€™t even know I pulled the trigger.Â  I was scared.Â  I seen my life in danger.Â  \r\n  I didnâ€™t know how to react.â€\r\nIn our view, the only evidence which appears to directly \r\n  support the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling is Crosbyâ€™s statement to \r\n  police in which he stated he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.Â  However, \r\n  this ignores the fact that Crosby immediately added that he didn't even know \r\n  he had pulled the trigger.Â  The effect of the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  holding is that if there is any evidence a shooting was intentional, all evidence \r\n  from which any other inference is may be drawn is negated.Â  This is not the \r\n  law of this state.Â  State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 433 S.E.2d 848 \r\n  (1993) (charge must be given if there is any evidence to support it; trial court \r\n  commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue \r\n  raised by the evidence).Â  We hold Crosby was entitled to a jury charge on the \r\n  law of involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\n355 S.C. 47, 51-53, 584 S.E.2d 110, 111-113 (2003) \r\n  (emphasis in original and emphasis added).\r\nAdditionally, Knoten is instructive \r\n  in this case.Â  The State argued that because Knoten retracted his confession \r\n  at trial, the trial court correctly refused to charge voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n  The court held that because the confession was introduced at trial, it would \r\n  support a charge on voluntary manslaughter regardless of the fact that the defendant \r\n  withdrew this confession:\r\n\r\nIn support of its second argument, that because Appellant \r\n  recanted his statement he was properly denied the requested voluntary \r\n  manslaughter charge, the State cites a single case, State v. Weaver, \r\n  265 S.C. 130, 217 S.E.2d 31 (1975).Â  In that case, the Court held there was \r\n  no error in denying the defendantâ€™s request to charge that if the jury found \r\n  the arresting officer used unreasonable force in effecting the arrest, the defendantâ€™s \r\n  resistance would not have been unlawful.Â  At trial, the defendant denied that \r\n  he resisted arrest.Â  The officer testified that he did not use unreasonable \r\n  force in effecting the arrest.Â  The defendant had made no pre-trial statement \r\n  which would have supported the requested charge.Â  The record contained no evidence \r\n  that the officer used unreasonable force, and therefore the requested charge \r\n  was not warranted.Â  See State v. Cole, supra.Â  Weaver \r\n  is distinguishable from the instant case.Â  Moreover, the Stateâ€™s argument does \r\n  not accurately reflect the law of this State.Â  In State v. Moore, 245 \r\n  S.C. 416, 140 S.E.2d 779 (1965), the defendant was charged with, and convicted \r\n  of, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  The trial court refused \r\n  his requested jury charge on simple assault and battery, despite testimony that \r\n  the victim had received only slight injuries.Â  The defendant testified that \r\n  he had been elsewhere when the incident occurred, and under the defenseâ€™s theory, \r\n  he could have been not guilty of even simple assault and battery.Â  The Court \r\n  held that the refusal to charge on the lesser included offense was reversible \r\n  error.Â  The Court stated that, \r\n  \r\nIn determining the issues to be submitted to the jury . . \r\n  . all of the testimony, both for the State and the defense, must \r\n  be considered. . . .Â  The fact that the defendant interposed the defense of \r\n  alibi did not deprive him of the benefit of the reasonable inferences to be \r\n  drawn from the testimony relative to the degree of the offense committed, for \r\n  the burden of establishing the offense charged rested upon the State. \r\n  \r\nId. at 420-21, 140 S.E.2d at 781.\r\nBecause there was evidenceâ€”in this case introduced \r\n  by the Stateâ€”supporting a conviction for the lesser included offense \r\n  of voluntary manslaughter, we reverse Appellantâ€™s conviction in the slaying \r\n  of Kimberly Brown.\r\n\r\n347 S.C. 296, 308-09, 555 S.E.2d 391, 397-98 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nThe efficacy of Knoten is that when the \r\n  State introduces a statement or confession, that statement or confession may \r\n  support an involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\nEvidence must exist that the killing was unintentional \r\n  and without malice, in addition to either an unlawful activity not naturally \r\n  tending to cause death or great bodily harm or a lawful activity with reckless \r\n  disregard for the safety of others.Â  The State introduced Reeseâ€™s statement \r\n  where the jury could infer Reeseâ€™s intent was to threaten to kill himself and \r\n  he did not point or present the gun to her; thereby finding the shooting of \r\n  the gun was unintentional.Â  Reese stated: \r\nI pulled the gun out and told her I was going to kill myself. \r\n  . . . I was moving the gun back and forth as a reaction.Â  I donâ€™t know why the \r\n  gun went off.Â  I thought both safeties were on.Â  I just wanted to see how she \r\n  would react when I told her I was going to kill myself.Â  I didnâ€™t mean to shoot \r\n  her.Â  When the gun went off I put my hands on my head.Â  I panicked.\r\nAccordingly, evidence does exist in the record that would \r\n  allow the jury to infer the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter \r\n  was committed.Â  The trial judge committed reversible error by failing to charge \r\n  the jury on involuntary manslaughter, which resulted in prejudice to the Reese. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n HEARN, C.J.: In my view, even \r\n  if the jury believed Reeseâ€™s statement that he shot his wife accidentally, he \r\n  was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter or accident charge because the \r\n  shooting occurred while Reese was engaged in the felony of pointing or presenting \r\n  a firearm.Â  Further, although I agree the trial judge erred by allowing the \r\n  solicitor to urge jurors to speak for the victim, I believe the error was harmless.Â  \r\n  Thus, I respectfully dissent.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Involuntary Manslaughter and Accident Charge\r\nIf there were any evidence from which it could \r\n  be inferred that Reese committed involuntary manslaughter, Reese would undoubtedly \r\n  be entitled to receive a jury charge on that lesser-included offense. See \r\n  State v. Gourdine, 322 S.C. 396, 398, 472 S.E.2d 241, 241 (1996) (â€œThe \r\n  trial judge is to charge the jury on a lesser included offense if there is any \r\n  evidence from which it could be inferred the lesser, rather than the greater, \r\n  offense was committed.â€). Likewise, a charge on accident would be warranted \r\n  if any evidence suggested that the victimâ€™s death resulted from an accidental \r\n  shooting.Â  However, I believe no such inferences can be drawn based on the record \r\n  before me.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that Reese and the victim were \r\n  separated at the time of the shooting, and the victim was living with her parents.Â  \r\n  The evening before the shooting, the State introduced phone records showing \r\n  that Reese had called the victimâ€™s cell phone fifty-one times between 9:45 p.m. \r\n  and 2:00 a.m.Â  When the victim was returning home during the early morning hours \r\n  on the day of the shooting, Reese was waiting for her at a stop sign in front \r\n  of her parentsâ€™ street.Â  The two drove separately to the home of the victimâ€™s \r\n  parents, and they talked outside.Â  As the majority opinion quoted, Reese made \r\n  a statement to the police claiming that while they were talking, he â€œpulled \r\n  the gun outâ€ and did not â€œknow why the gun went offâ€ when he was â€œmoving it \r\n  back and forth.â€Â  Importantly, Reese never denied pointing the gun at the victim.Â  \r\n  Rather, he stated that he was surprised by the shooting because â€œhe thought \r\n  both safeties were on.â€Â  Moreover, in addition to Reeseâ€™s admission that he \r\n  was waving the gun back and forth, numerous witnesses testified (and the tragic \r\n  result makes clear) that the gun was pointed in the victimâ€™s direction.Â  In \r\n  fact, the crime scene investigator, the deputy coroner, and a forensic pathologist \r\n  all testified that the gun was not only pointed at the victim, but was very \r\n  near to or right against the victimâ€™s head. [2] Â  There is simply nothing in the record to contradict \r\n  this evidence.\r\nTo warrant a charge of involuntary manslaughter \r\n  or accident, a homicide cannot have occurred during the commission of a felony. [3] Â Â  In South Carolina, it is a felony â€œfor a \r\n  person to present or point at another person a loaded or unloaded firearm.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-410 (1976).Â  Thus, whether or not Reese intended to shoot \r\n  his wife, he would not be entitled to an involuntary manslaughter or accident \r\n  charge because the only evidence in the record is that the shooting occurred \r\n  while he was committing the felony of â€œpresenting or pointingâ€ a firearm.Â  See \r\n  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 170, 478 S.E.2d 260, 268 (1996), cert. \r\n  denied, 520 U.S. 1200 (1997) (defining involuntary manslaughter, in relevant \r\n  part, as the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but while \r\n  one is engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting to a felony \r\n  and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm); State v. \r\n  Young, 319 S.C. 33, 39-40, 459 S.E.2d 84, 87-88 (1995) (finding the defendant \r\n  was not entitled to a charge of involuntary manslaughter despite his statement \r\n  that the gun â€œjust went offâ€ because his statement also indicated he was committing \r\n  the felony of armed robbery at the time of the shooting).Â  \r\nThe majority correctly notes that the negligent \r\n  handling of a firearm supports a charge for involuntary manslaughter; however, \r\n  where the mishandling of a weapon coincides with the commission of a felony \r\n  or some other unlawful act that naturally tends to cause death or great bodily \r\n  harm, an involuntary manslaughter charge is not warranted.Â  In State v. Burris, \r\n  334 S.C. 256, 2665, 513 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1999), our supreme court found that \r\n  evidence on the record could support a finding that appellant was entitled to \r\n  arm himself in self-defense and was therefore acting lawfully when his negligent \r\n  handling of a loaded weapon caused the weapon to fire and kill the victim. \r\n  [4] Â  Likewise, in State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 50, 584 S.E.2d 110, \r\n  111 (2003), the supreme court held that involuntary manslaughter should have \r\n  been instructed because there was evidence that the victim was charging the \r\n  appellant with his hand behind his back, and the appellant closed his eyes and \r\n  fired the gun, without even realizing he had pulled the trigger.Â  In both of \r\n  these cases, the appellants were entitled to a charge of involuntary manslaughter \r\n  because there was evidence from which the jury could infer they were lawfully \r\n  acting in self-defense when they unintentionally fired a gun. \r\n  [5] \r\nIn the case at hand, Reese was not acting in self-defense. \r\n  Â Rather, by his own admission, he was brandishing a gun in order to see how \r\n  his wife would react if he threatened to shoot himself.Â  While he had the gun \r\n  in the air, he moved it back and forth, and according to all the evidence in \r\n  the record, when it was very close to his wifeâ€™s head, he shot her.Â  Even if \r\n  Reese did not intend to shoot his wife, he is not entitled to an involuntary \r\n  manslaughter charge because, at the time of the shooting, he was pointing or \r\n  presenting a weapon, which is a felony, and he was attempting suicide, an unlawful \r\n  act naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm.Â  See State \r\n  v. Levelle, 34 S.C. 120, 13 S.E. 319 (1819) (stating that suicide is an \r\n  unlawful act and that if A takes Bâ€™s life when attempting suicide, A is guilty \r\n  of murder) overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 \r\n  S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  Accordingly, I would affirm the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  ruling denying Reeseâ€™s request to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter \r\n  and accident.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Closing Argument\r\nIn regards to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, \r\n  which urged the jury to â€œspeak for the victim,â€ I agree with the majorityâ€™s \r\n  finding that this type of argument impermissibly asks the jurors to advocate \r\n  for the victim.Â  However, I find the judgeâ€™s error in allowing the argument \r\n  was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Reeseâ€™s guilt.Â  See \r\n  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (stating \r\n  that an error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result \r\n  of the trial); see, e.g., State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, \r\n  577-578, 564 S.E.2d 103, 109 (2002) (applying harmless error analysis to improper \r\n  comment by prosecutor during closing argument as to defendantâ€™s failure to call \r\n  a witness).\r\nIn Reeseâ€™s statement to police, he claimed he pulled \r\n  out a gun and told the victim he was going to kill himself.Â  He admitted that \r\n  he was waving the gun back and forth and that the gun went off, though he denied \r\n  purposefully killing her.Â  Numerous witnesses testified that the victim died \r\n  as a result of a single gunshot wound.Â  Those witnesses also testified that \r\n  the gun was either very near or right against the victimâ€™s head.Â  Based on this \r\n  overwhelming evidence of Reeseâ€™s guilt, especially the uncontradicted evidence \r\n  that he shot the victim in the head while feloniously presenting a firearm, \r\n  I firmly believe the solicitorâ€™s improper comments during closing argument were \r\n  harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nIII. Purported Hearsay Regarding Marital Problems\r\nBecause I propose to affirm Reeseâ€™s convictions, \r\n  I briefly address his other arguments on appeal.Â  Reese contends the trial judge \r\n  erred in allowing witnesses to testify that the victim had moved to her motherâ€™s \r\n  home because of marital problems.Â  Reese asserts such testimony was hearsay.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe victimâ€™s cousin testified without objection \r\n  that â€œa week or twoâ€ before the victim was killed, she and Reese separated and \r\n  she had moved back in with her parents.Â  Because no objection was made to this \r\n  testimony, subsequent testimony wherein witnesses stated that Reese and the \r\n  victim had marital problems, without giving any details, was cumulative to the \r\n  cousinâ€™s testimony, which was admitted without objection.Â  Therefore, even assuming \r\n  arguendo that the other witnessesâ€™ testimony was impermissible hearsay, \r\n  any error in admitting their testimony was harmless. See State v. \r\n  South, 285 S.C. 529, 535, 331 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1985) (finding that although \r\n  the court erred by admitting officerâ€™s notes into evidence, the â€œerror was harmless \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt since [notes were] cumulative to the abundant amount \r\n  of similar evidence admitted at trialâ€).Â Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  State of Mind Hearsay Exception\r\nReese also argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in allowing witnesses to testify that the victim was â€œafraid for her lifeâ€ because \r\n  such testimony did not meet the state of mind exception to the rule against \r\n  hearsay.Â  Our supreme court addressed the scope of the state of mind exception \r\n  in State v. Garcia, 334 S.C. 71, 76, 512 S.E.2d 507, 509 (1999), and \r\n  found that â€œwhile the present state of the declarantâ€™s mind is admissible as \r\n  an exception to hearsay, the reason for the declarantâ€™s state of mind is not.â€Â  \r\n  Reese contends that the witnessesâ€™s testimony that the victim was afraid for \r\n  her life impermissibly related to the reason for the victimâ€™s state of mind.Â  \r\n  I disagree.Â  \r\nIn Garcia, the witnesses repeated out-of-court statements \r\n  that the defendant had kicked and threatened to kill the decedent and because \r\n  of that, the decedent had been afraid.Â  Here, the witnesses merely testified \r\n  that Reeseâ€™s wife feared for her life, which described the type of fear she \r\n  experienced rather than the cause for such fear.Â  As such, the trial judge correctly \r\n  admitted the testimony under Rule 803(3), SCRE.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Admissibility of Photographs\r\nFinally, Reese argues the trial judge erred by allowing the \r\n  State to admit photographs of the victimâ€™s body into evidence because the photographs \r\n  were more prejudicial than probative.Â  Generally, a trial judgeâ€™s decision to \r\n  admit evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n  Because Reese failed to provide this court with a copy of those photographs, \r\n  I would not meet the merits of this issue.Â  See Harkins v. Greenville \r\n  County, 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000) (explaining that the \r\n  appellant has the burden of presenting the appellate court with an adequate \r\n  record).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI respectfully disagree with the majorityâ€™s holding that \r\n  Reese was entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter.Â  Further, although \r\n  I agree that the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was improper, I believe the error \r\n  was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Reeseâ€™s guilt.Â  All of \r\n  Reeseâ€™s other arguments on appeal are without merit.Â  Therefore, I would affirm \r\n  Reeseâ€™s conviction for murder.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In view of our reversal of the case on the identified \r\n    issues, we decline to address any other arguments.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The deputy coroner testified that â€œ[t]he gunshot wound appeared to \r\n    be a contact or very near a contact type wound.â€Â  The crime scene investigator \r\n    also testified that upon observation of the body he believed the victimâ€™s \r\n    death was caused by a either â€œsoft contact or a close contact type wound.â€ \r\n    Likewise, the forensic pathologist, who performed an autopsy on the body, \r\n    testified that there was a â€œloose contact gunshot wound to the left side of \r\n    the head.â€Â  The pathologist further explained that â€œ[t]he gun was just brushing \r\n    the skin.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  South Carolina courts have defined involuntary manslaughter as either \r\n    (1) the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but while one \r\n    is engaged in the commission of some unlawful act not amounting to a felony \r\n    and not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) the \r\n    killing of another without malice and unintentionally but while engaged in \r\n    the doing of a lawful act with a reckless disregard of the safety of others.Â  \r\n    State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 170, 478 S.E.2d 260, 268 (1996), \r\n    cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1200 (1997).Â  For a homicide to be deemed an accident, \r\n    there must be evidence that the killing was unintentional, the defendant was \r\n    acting lawfully, and due care was exercised in the handling of the weapon.Â  \r\n    State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The majority also cites to State v. White, 253 S.C. 475, 478, \r\n    171 S.E.2d 712, 714 (1969), for the proposition that the negligent handling \r\n    of a loaded gun supports a finding for involuntary manslaughter.Â  Although \r\n    White does cite that proposition of law, the opinion does not discuss \r\n    whether the defendant was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge based \r\n    on the negligent mishandling of a loaded gun.Â  The issue in White was \r\n    whether the trial judge erred in allowing an indictment for murder to go to \r\n    the jury when the only charge submitted to the jury was involuntary manslaughter.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The only other cases in which our appellate courts have found that \r\n    a defendantâ€™s negligent handling of a loaded firearm supported a charge for \r\n    involuntary manslaughter are State v. Causer, 87 S.C. 516, 517, 70 \r\n    S.E. 161, 161 (1911) (defendant took a hunting rifle away from decedent, who \r\n    had been pointing the gun at two little boys, and defendant was walking away \r\n    with the gun when, â€œin some unexplained way it went off, killing the [decedent], \r\n    who had walked up behindâ€); State v. Tucker, 86 S.C. 211, 212, 68 S.E. \r\n    523, 524 (1910) (defendant was â€œrubbing [a] pistolâ€ while sitting next to \r\n    his half-brother, and â€œwithout knowing that [the pistol] was loaded or that \r\n    his brother was in front of him, [defendant] pulled the trigger without meaning \r\n    to do soâ€); State v. Revels, 86 S.C. 213, 214-215, 68 S.E. 523, 523 \r\n    (1910) (a decedent grabbed and pulled on the defendantâ€™s cocked gun when it \r\n    fired, fatally shooting decedent in the knee); State v. Gilliam, 66 \r\n    S.C. 419, 421, 45 S.E. 6, 7 (1903) (defendant and his decedent wife were â€œin \r\n    a playful tussleâ€ for the possession of a pistol when the gun unintentionally \r\n    fired).Â Â Â  Notably, all of these cases differ from the case at hand because \r\n    the negligent mishandling of the weapon coincided with lawful activities.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3791","title":"Seabrook Island v.

Wheeler &amp; Edward T. Fenno, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nTimothy A. Domin, of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.: Seabrook Island \r\n  Property Owners Association (the â€œAssociationâ€) brought this action against \r\n  Michael Casa and his development companies, Marshland Trust, Inc., and Orangehill \r\n  Plantation, LLC, (collectively, â€œDevelopersâ€), to prevent construction of a \r\n  bridge from Seabrook Island to two nearby marsh islands.Â  The circuit court \r\n  found the Association did not have the right to deny the construction and denied \r\n  the Associationâ€™s request for an injunction.Â  The Association appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nSeabrook Island is a restricted-access resort community in \r\n  Charleston County, South Carolina.Â  In 1972, the subdivision of Seabrook Island \r\n  was zoned as a planned unit development (â€œPUDâ€) for Charleston County, which \r\n  allowed for multiple zoning uses without the need to obtain separate zoning \r\n  approval for each use.Â Â  Seabrook Island formed the Association to enforce the \r\n  restrictive covenants within the PUD.Â  In 1987, the incorporation of the Town \r\n  of Seabrook Island shifted control of the area from the county to the Town, \r\n  and the Town adopted the countyâ€™s PUD provisions.Â Â Â  \r\nCasa owned two lots in Seabrook Island \r\n  in Area 6 of the PUD.Â  Area 6 was zoned mixed commercial and residential.Â  One \r\n  of the lots was located in the commercial area and another lot, Lot 5, was located \r\n  in a primarily residential area known as Marsh Creek.Â  Casa intended to develop \r\n  patio homes on Lot 5.Â  Marsh Creek is subject to the Associationâ€™s Covenants.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Developers outbid the Association and \r\n  purchased from the United States Bankruptcy Trustee two islands, Islands A and \r\n  B, located in the marsh near Seabrook Island.Â  Developers originally \r\n  sought a permit from the South Carolina Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource \r\n  Management (OCRM) to build two bridges to access the islands â€“ one 350 foot \r\n  bridge from Lot 5 to Island B and a 750 foot bridge from Casaâ€™s commercial lot \r\n  to Island A.Â  Developers changed their proposal to using Lot 5 as the jumping \r\n  off point for a bridge or â€œdrivewayâ€ to both islands.Â  A single 290 foot bridge, \r\n  emanating from Lot 5, would go to Island B, and a 600 foot bridge would emanate \r\n  from Island B to Island A.  [1]  \r\n \r\n\r\nAfter receiving permit approval from the OCRM for \r\n  the single bridge proprosal, Developers submitted an application to the Associationâ€™s \r\n  Architectural Review Board (â€œARBâ€) for permission to install a curb cut on Lot \r\n  5 for access to Islands A and B.Â  The ARB denied Developersâ€™ proposal, believing \r\n  the islands were located outside the PUD. \r\n  [2] Â  The ARB informed Developers that it had no authority to approve a \r\n  curb cut for access to property outside the PUD.Â  The ARB denied Developersâ€™ \r\n  appeal, stating it would continue to deny any plans showing an easement across \r\n  Lot 5 to access the islands.Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe Association then filed suit seeking: \r\n  (i) a declaratory judgment on its right to regulate use of Lot 5; (ii) a permanent \r\n  injunction against Developers from using Lot 5 or any other property within \r\n  the Seabrook Island Development to access Islands A and B; and (iii) an injunction \r\n  against Developers from using Lot 5 for any other nonresidential purpose.Â  \r\n  The circuit court found the Association did not have the right to deny Developersâ€™ \r\n  use of Lot 5 as a â€œjumping off pointâ€ for the islands and denied injunctive \r\n  relief.Â  Â The judge stated although ARB approval is required for the \r\n  bridge, Developers should be allowed to use Lot 5; otherwise, access to the \r\n  islands would be unreasonably restricted.Â  The judge based his decision on favoring \r\n  Developersâ€™ free use of property.Â Â  The Association appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA declaratory judgment action is neither \r\n  legal nor equitable in nature, but it takes on the tenor of the underlying action.Â  \r\n  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction \r\n  is in equity.â€Â  Kneale v. Bonds, 317 S.C. 262, 265, 452 S.E.2d 840, 841 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994).Â  On appeal from an action at equity, tried by the judge alone \r\n  without a reference, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance \r\n  with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  In re Thames, 344 \r\n  S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œHowever, this broad scope \r\n  of review does not require the appellate court to ignore the findings below \r\n  when the trial court was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of \r\n  the witnesses.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  RESTRICTIVE \r\n  COVENANTS\r\nThe Association argues the restrictive covenants \r\n  convey upon it and the ARB the right to deny Developersâ€™ plan to construct a \r\n  bridge to Islands A and B.Â  The Association further argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in relying upon a zoning ordinance to supersede the authority found in \r\n  the restrictive covenants.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.\r\nThe language of a restrictive covenant is to be \r\n  construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the \r\n  time of execution.Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, \r\n  863 (1998).Â  â€œ[A]s voluntary contracts, restrictive covenants will be enforced \r\n  unless they are indefinite or contravene public policy.â€Â  Houck v. Rivers, \r\n  316 S.C. 414, 416, 450 S.E.2d 106, 108 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Restrictions on the \r\n  use of property will be strictly construed with all doubts resolved in favor \r\n  of free use of the property, although the rule of strict construction should \r\n  not be used to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the restrictive covenant.Â  \r\n  Taylor, 332 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864.Â  Although an architectural \r\n  review board has discretion regarding approval of proposed construction, that \r\n  discretion is â€œconstrained only by reasonableness and good faith.â€Â  River \r\n  Hills Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Amato, 326 S.C. 255, 259, 487 S.E.2d 179, 181 \r\n  (1997); Oâ€™Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1992). \r\n\r\nThe Association first argues: (1) the Covenants apply to \r\n  Lot 5, the Covenants give the Association broad discretion to reject the bridge \r\n  proposal, and (2) it is reasonable for the Association to deny construction \r\n  of the bridge.Â  As explained below, we agree with the circuit court that it \r\n  is unreasonable for the Association to deny construction of the bridge on Lot \r\n  5.\r\nDevelopersâ€™ counsel admitted, and Casa \r\n  testified at trial, that Lot 5 was subject to the Associationâ€™s Covenants.Â Â  \r\n  Further, the deed to Lot 5 provided that the property was subject to the Covenants.Â  \r\n  The Covenants grant the Association the right to adopt and enforce regulations \r\n  pertaining to â€œplanning, construction and design of improvements on property \r\n  or alterations thereto.â€Â  Association Covenants Â§ 2.Â Â  The Covenants give sole \r\n  discretion to the Board or the ARB to approve or disapprove of plans â€œbased \r\n  upon any ground, including purely aesthetic conditions.â€Â  Id. at Â§ 19.Â  \r\n  Â The sections of the Covenants pertinent to this appeal provide as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œNo building of any kind or description, fence, swimming \r\n  pool, or other structure, shall be erected, placed, or altered on any Lot in \r\n  the Seabrook Island Development, until the proposed building plans . . . shall \r\n  have been approved in writing by the . . . [Associationâ€™s] Architectural Review \r\n  Board . . . .â€Â  Association Covenants Â§ 19.\r\nâ€œThe design and location of [bridges] on Property which is \r\n  . . . subject to these Covenants, must be approved by the ARB.â€Â  Id. \r\n  Â§ 25.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held the islands were listed \r\n  within the Countyâ€™s original PUD, which was adopted by the Town of Seabrook \r\n  Island.Â Â  The court found Lot 5 was subject to the restrictions in the Covenants, \r\n  but the restrictions conflicted with the mixed commercial/residential use permitted \r\n  in Area 6.Â  Although the court found that the â€œdrivewayâ€/bridge from Lot 5 to \r\n  the islands would be a â€œbuilding . . . or other structureâ€ subject to the ARBâ€™s \r\n  approval under Covenant Â§ 19, Developers were nevertheless entitled to use Lot \r\n  5 as a driveway to the island.Â Â  The court found that otherwise, â€œaccess to \r\n  the islands would be unreasonably restricted, and [Developers] would be . . \r\n  . unjustifiably denied the free use of its property.â€ \r\nReviewing the restrictive covenants and strictly \r\n  construing them in favor of free use of the property, we find the circuit court \r\n  did not commit error.Â  The Covenants grant the ARB the right to approve or disapprove \r\n  building plans, even for purely aesthetic reasons.Â  Lot 5, as admitted by Developers \r\n  and pursuant to deed, is subject to those restrictions.Â  However, to outright \r\n  deny building a driveway/bridge from Lot 5 would deny access to the islands.Â  \r\n  Although the ARB had the power to generally approve or disapprove of specific \r\n  bridge plans â€œon any grounds,â€ to outright deny the building of a bridge that \r\n  would give access to the islands would be an unreasonable exercise of that power.Â  \r\n  Based on a preponderance of the evidence, the circuit court correctly held that \r\n  it would not grant the Association a declaratory judgment finding the Association \r\n  had the authority to deny Developersâ€™ request to build a bridge.Â  \r\nB.\r\nIn its next argument, the Association states the \r\n  circuit court erroneously relied upon a â€œzoning ordinanceâ€ to supersede the \r\n  effect of the Covenants.Â  The Association, however, essentially argues the court \r\n  erred in relying upon the permitted uses of the PUD for Area 6.Â  We find the \r\n  circuit court did not commit error.Â  \r\nThe Covenants appear to restrict their residential provisions \r\n  to residential property.Â  Covenant Â§ 5 provides that â€œ[a]ll property shown \r\n  in the PUD as residential property which is now or hereafter becomes, by \r\n  express reference or otherwise, subject to these Covenants, shall be used for \r\n  residential purposes only.â€Â  Covenants Â§ 5 (emphasis added).Â  As previously \r\n  discussed, Lot 5 is located in a section known as Area 6, and Area 6 is â€œshown \r\n  in the PUDâ€ as allowing a mixture of commercial and residential use.Â Â  As admitted \r\n  by Developers, Lot 5 is subject to the Covenants by deed.Â  \r\nReviewing the conflict between the restriction \r\n  in application in the Covenants to properties shown in the PUD as residential \r\n  and the mixed commercial/residential use allowed in the PUD for Area 6, the \r\n  circuit court noted as follows:\r\n\r\nI find that while Lot 5 is subject to the foregoing provisions \r\n  of the [Association] covenants, these provisions, as applied to [Developers], \r\n  conflict with the permitted use of the property in Area 6.Â  If [sic] find that \r\n  these provisions should not be interpreted to prohibit [Developersâ€™] use of \r\n  its property considering the mixed use allowed for other property located in \r\n  Area 6.Â  I find that when read as a whole the entire [Association] covenants \r\n  and PUD documents do not give the [Association] the right to deny [Developers] \r\n  the right to use the property as the â€œjumping off pointâ€ for the two islands.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Association points to this portion of the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order as proof that the judge erroneously relied upon the uses allowed for Area \r\n  6 instead of relying upon the applicable Covenants.Â  Clearly, the circuit court \r\n  did not rely on the allowed uses for Area 6; instead, the court merely pointed \r\n  out the conflict between the restriction in the Covenants to residential uses \r\n  â€œas shown in the PUDâ€ and the allowance of commercial uses listed in the PUD \r\n  for Area 6.Â  Despite the conflict, the circuit court found that nothing granted \r\n  the Association the right to deny complete access to the islands.Â  To deny complete \r\n  access to the islands would be an unreasonable exercise of the Associationâ€™s \r\n  authority.Â  Resolving this conflict in favor of free use of the property, we \r\n  find the circuit court did not commit any error.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of \r\n  Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, \r\n  302 (2001) (â€œA restriction on the use of property must be created in express \r\n  terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are \r\n  to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use \r\n  of property.â€).\r\nThe Association further asserts the circuit court \r\n  erred by failing to find that Lot 5 was â€œsetâ€ as a residential property, despite \r\n  the mixed commercial/residential use allowed in the PUD for Area 6.Â  \r\nDevelopers submitted plans to build patio homes \r\n  on Lot 5, in addition to using Lot 5 as the starting point for the â€œdrivewayâ€/bridge \r\n  to the islands.Â  The area surrounding Lot 5, Marsh Creek, contained purely residential \r\n  developments.Â Â  The Association argues this makes it clear that the character \r\n  of Lot 5 has been set as residential, and the circuit court erred in relying \r\n  upon the mixed use allowed by the PUD for Area 6 to overcome the restrictions \r\n  on building bridges as found in the Covenants.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough the developments surrounding Lot 5 in \r\n  Marsh Creek have been strictly residential, the circuit court correctly pointed \r\n  out in its order that â€œnothing in the governing PUD limits the use of Area 6 \r\n  and Marsh Creek to residential use only.â€Â  Thus, nothing in either the Covenants \r\n  or the PUD indicates that the type of development located on Lot 5 has to be \r\n  residential.Â  Despite pointing out this conflict, the circuit court relied on \r\n  the potential restriction of free use of property if the Association were allowed \r\n  to completely bar construction of a driveway/bridge.Â  Thus, the circuit court \r\n  did not rely upon the PUD provisions to â€œoverrideâ€ the Covenants; the court \r\n  merely found the Associationâ€™s denial of a driveway unreasonable.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  there is no merit to the Associationâ€™s argument.Â  \r\nWe further note that it is unreasonable for the \r\n  Association to deny construction of the bridge because the bridge is essentially \r\n  a driveway to a single-family residence, and therefore, clearly a residential \r\n  use.Â  Developersâ€™ proposal states the bridge would be wooden and would \r\n  be only 14 feet wide and a total of 890 feet long.Â  The bridge would begin on \r\n  Lot 5, continue 290 feet to Island B, then 600 feet to Island A. Â A bridge \r\n  emanating from the commercial lot would be longer and more of an imposition \r\n  to the natural marsh environment.Â  OCRM did not approve a proposal concerning \r\n  a bridge emanating from the commercial lot.Â  The only approved plan was a bridge \r\n  from Lot 5.Â  Considering the proposed size and general appearance of the bridge, \r\n  it would be unreasonable for the Association to deny construction of the bridge \r\n  based on the argument it is commercial.Â Â  \r\nWhile Lot 5 is subject to the Associationâ€™s Covenants, we \r\n  find the circuit court judge committed no error in finding the Association does \r\n  not have the right to deny Developers the use of the property as a jumping off \r\n  point for access to the islands.\r\nII.Â  DENIAL OF \r\n  ACCESS\r\nThe Association also argues denying construction \r\n  of the bridge on Lot 5 would not unreasonably restrict access to the islands \r\n  because Developers can access the islands from Casaâ€™s adjacent commercial property \r\n  on Landfall Way.Â  However, Casa testified using Lot 5 as the jumping off point \r\n  would lead to a much more efficient and aesthetically pleasing way to build \r\n  the bridge.Â Â  Casa stated although he could use his commercial property as a \r\n  jumping off point, that would require using two separate bridges for a total \r\n  length of 1100 feet, whereas using Lot 5 allows the project to be consolidated \r\n  into one bridge that has less impact on the environment.Â Â  Further, OCRM approved \r\n  the plan with the bridge coming from Lot 5, not the plan with two bridges.Â Â  \r\n\r\nBecause using Lot 5 as the jumping off point allows the most \r\n  efficient and aesthetically pleasing way to construct the bridge, we find it \r\n  was proper for the circuit court judge to find Developers would be unreasonably \r\n  restricted from using Islands A and B if Lot 5 could not be used as a jumping \r\n  off point.\r\nIII.Â  DENIAL OF \r\n  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\r\nThe Association argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in failing to grant its request for injunctive relief to enforce its valid restrictive \r\n  covenants.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe remedy of injunction is a drastic one and \r\n  should be cautiously applied only when legal rights are unlawfully invaded or \r\n  legal duties are willfully or wantonly neglected.â€Â  LeFurgy v. Long Cove \r\n  Club Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, Inc., 313 S.C. 555, 558, 443 S.E.2d 577, 578 (Ct. App. \r\n  1994).Â  â€œThe issuance of an injunction depends upon the equities between the \r\n  parties and if great injury will be done to the [party sought to be enjoined] \r\n  with little benefit to the other property owners, it is proper for the trial \r\n  court to deny equitable relief.â€Â  Kneale, 317 S.C. at 268, 452 S.E.2d \r\n  at 843.\r\nReviewing the evidence before this Court, we find \r\n  the circuit court correctly denied the Associationâ€™s request for an injunction.Â  \r\n  The Association sought to deny the construction of any bridge to the \r\n  islands, thus denying complete access.Â  The circuit court held there was no \r\n  likelihood of irreparable harm to the Association if the injunction were denied \r\n  and great harm, in the form of denial of the free use of property, to Developers \r\n  if the injunction were granted.Â  Although the Covenants give the Association \r\n  the right to approve or disapprove of plans, including bridges, these restrictions \r\n  must be strictly construed in favor of the free use of property.Â  Taylor, \r\n  332 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864.Â  Because an injunction on the building of \r\n  a bridge to the islands would greatly harm Developersâ€™ ability to access the \r\n  property, we find the circuit court correctly denied the injunction.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn order to allow Developers free use of Islands \r\n  A and B, some form of access to the islands is required.Â  We find using Lot \r\n  5 as a jumping off point is both a residential use of property and the most \r\n  efficient and aesthetically pleasing way to construct the bridge.Â  Based on \r\n  the above, the decision of the circuit court is \r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Interestingly, Developers informed the Court at oral argument that \r\n    they had settled a separate dispute with the Town of Seabrook Island.Â  As \r\n    part of that settlement, Developers agreed to only develop Island B.Â  Island \r\n    A would remain a natural area.Â  Thus, only one bridge, emanating from Lot \r\n    5, would be necessary and there would be less of an imposition on the natural \r\n    marsh environment.Â  However, because this settlement was not between the two \r\n    parties in the current appeal and was not a matter in the Record before us, \r\n    we cannot consider this agreement.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] The circuit court held the islands were within the PUD.Â  The Association \r\n    has not appealed this finding, and it is the law of the case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition \r\n    Fund, L.P. v.

Rouse alleging conversion and wrongful withholding \r\n  of certain funds and personal property due to the widow of Robert L. Bateman.Â  \r\n  The trial court issued an order awarding certain items of property to each party.Â  \r\n  Both parties appeal.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nClotell Bateman married Robert \r\n  Bateman in 1944 when she was sixteen years old.Â  The couple lived together continuously \r\n  until 1968.Â  On November 14, 1983, Robert Bateman purportedly obtained a divorce \r\n  from Clotell.Â  In 1988, Robert married Helen Rouse.Â  Robert died on August 9, \r\n  1994.Â  Upon his death, Helen received survivorâ€™s pension benefits, workerâ€™s \r\n  death benefits under Social Security, survivorâ€™s insurance policy proceeds, \r\n  and a flag from the Veterans Administration.Â  \r\nIn 1996, Clotell filed a motion to vacate \r\n  the order of divorce, contending that the decree was void and that Robertâ€™s \r\n  marriage to Helen was invalid.Â  On July 7, 1997, the family court declared the \r\n  1983 divorce decree void ab initio due to Robertâ€™s misrepresentations \r\n  and fraud upon the court in obtaining service by publication in his action for \r\n  divorce.Â  Therefore, the family court found the divorce decree and Robertâ€™s \r\n  marriage to Helen were void, and declared Clotell to be Robertâ€™s wife at the \r\n  date of his death.Â  The family court ordered that â€œany funds due to the widow \r\n  of [Robert] be paid over to [Clotell].â€Â  This order was not appealed.\r\nClotell brought this action on May 12, 2000 \r\n  seeking to recover the following items that had been disbursed to Helen in her \r\n  capacity as Robertâ€™s widow:\r\n\r\n  a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â $41,619.48 received from \r\n  Robertâ€™s pension;\r\n  b)&nbsp;&nbsp; a death benefit of $10,000 under \r\n  the Pension and Welfare Fund;\r\n  c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $35,000 survivorâ€™s insurance \r\n  policy proceeds under the Welfare Fund;\r\n  d)&nbsp;&nbsp; certain other bonuses and benefits;\r\n  e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a flag and certificate from \r\n  the Veterans Administration; and\r\n  f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robertâ€™s discharge \r\n  papers.\r\n\r\nClotell alleged Helen committed conversion \r\n  and wrongful withholding [1]  \r\n  by obtaining these items that rightfully belong to Clotell, as Robertâ€™s widow \r\n  under the 1997 family court order.Â  Helen answered Clotellâ€™s complaint, specifically \r\n  requesting a jury trial and asserting several equitable defenses. Â The \r\n  case was set on the jury roster in Charleston County.Â  Immediately before the \r\n  trial began, the trial judge ruled on his own motion that Helen did not have \r\n  a right to a jury trial because the claims and defenses were equitable in nature.Â  \r\n  In denying Helenâ€™s request for a jury trial, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\nNow, bottom line is this.Â  No matter which way you couch it, [Clotellâ€™s] action \r\n  arises upon the basis of a family court decision unappealed from, finding that \r\n  their marriage was never ended, because jurisdiction in the â€™82 divorce action \r\n  was never conferred upon the family court in Charleston County.Â  Thatâ€™s it.\r\nThe defenses as raised, even though it may be styled as conversion, the defenses \r\n  as raised are all equitable.Â  In an equity cause of action the trial court has \r\n  to find matters of fact and matters of law in order to resolve equitable issues.Â  \r\n  Just because thereâ€™s a question of fact in an equitable defense does not mean \r\n  itâ€™s a trial by jury.Â  It canâ€™t be.Â  If that were the case, then you could never \r\n  have a trial by court only, under equity, master in equity, or other issues, \r\n  because in every single case there has to be a finding of fact, conclusion of \r\n  law, an order in order to resolve the case\r\n. . . .\r\nNow, it is equity, no matter which way you cut it.Â  The reason it is equity \r\n  is because the family court made a decision that gave rights to [Clotell], perhaps.Â  \r\n  Whether it should be here or in probate court, Iâ€™m not going to address that \r\n  issue except perhaps in a final order.\r\n. . . .\r\nI find as a matter of law that this is in essence an equitable action pursuant \r\n  to the code section â€“ excuse me, not the code section, Rule 39(a) and (b).Â  \r\n  I do not find that [Helen] has a jury issue in this particular case.Â  I find \r\n  further that [Clotell] in her filing did not request a trial by jury, and therefore \r\n  weâ€™re going to go forward today as a nonjury trial.Â  Obviously both sidesâ€™ rights \r\n  are protected pursuant to my decision.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge then advised counsel \r\n  that the jury trial issue was not immediately appealable and denied Helenâ€™s \r\n  motion to hold the matter in abeyance to allow for appeal.Â  The case proceeded \r\n  to trial that same day after a brief recess.\r\nAt the close of her case \r\n  in chief, Clotell moved to amend the pleadings to include causes of action for \r\n  recoupment and unjust enrichment.Â  The judge took the matter under advisement \r\n  until the conclusion of the case.Â  \r\nIn the final order dated June 17, 2002, \r\n  the trial judge found sufficient evidence to support the causes of action for \r\n  conversion and wrongful withholding, but did not find sufficient evidence to \r\n  support the claim for recoupment.Â  In addition, the judge found that while Helen \r\n  had been unjustly enriched at Clotellâ€™s expense, Clotellâ€™s original claims for \r\n  conversion and wrongful withholding afforded her sufficient relief.Â  He therefore \r\n  granted judgment against Helen in the amount of $41,619.48 for the survivorâ€™s \r\n  pension benefits and $255 for the workerâ€™s death benefit under Social Security.Â  \r\n  He also awarded Clotell the flag from the Veterans Administration.Â  Clotellâ€™s \r\n  claims for return of the $35,000 survivorâ€™s insurance proceeds under the Welfare \r\n  Fund and the $10,000 death benefits were denied on the grounds that Robertâ€™s \r\n  designation of Helen as beneficiary was evidence of his intent that she receive \r\n  the proceeds and benefits.Â  Helen appeals, arguing the trial judge erred in \r\n  (1) denying her right to a jury trial, (2) refusing to grant her motion for \r\n  directed verdict, and (3) denying her equitable defenses.Â  Clotell also appeals, \r\n  asserting the trial judge erred by (1) failing to award her the $35,000 insurance \r\n  proceeds, and (2) excluding certain testimony.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDenial of the request for a jury trial \r\n   \r\n\r\nHelen argues the trial judge erred in ruling \r\n  she did not have a right to a jury trial because Clotellâ€™s claim for conversion \r\n  was an action at law.Â  We agree.\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution \r\n  preserves the right of trial by jury only in those cases in which parties would \r\n  have been entitled to it at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.Â  Lester \r\n  v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 267, 491 S.E.2d 240, 242 (1997).Â  See also \r\n  Rule 38 (a), SCRCP (â€œThe right of trial by jury as declared by the Constitution \r\n  or as given by a statute of South Carolina shall be preserved to the parties \r\n  inviolate.Â  Issues of fact in an action for the recovery of money only or of \r\n  specific real or personal property must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial \r\n  be waived.â€).Â Â  â€œGenerally, the relevant question in determining the right to \r\n  trial by jury is whether an action is legal or equitable; there is no right \r\n  to trial by jury for equitable actions.â€Â  Lester, 327 S.C. at 267, 491 \r\n  S.E.2d at 242 (citation omitted).Â  Whether an action is legal or equitable is \r\n  primarily determined by the allegations in the complaint.Â  See Natâ€™l \r\n  Bank of South Carolina v. Daniels, 283 S.C. 438, 440, 322 S.E.2d 689, 690 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Where legal and equitable issues or rights are raised in the \r\n  same complaint, the legal issues are for determination by a jury and the equitable \r\n  issues are for determination by the court.Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 306 S.C. \r\n  376, 379, 412 S.E.2d 397, 398-99 (1991).Â  Furthermore, either party may demand \r\n  a trial by jury of any issue triable by jury.Â  See Rule 38 (b), SCRCP.Â Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;â€œAn action for damages for conversion \r\n  is an action at law.â€Â  Blackwell v. Blackwell, 289 S.C. 470, 471, 346 \r\n  S.E.2d 731, 732 (Ct. App. 1986) (citation omitted).Â  In this case, Clotell asserted \r\n  causes of action for conversion, wrongful withholding, recoupment, and unjust \r\n  enrichment.Â  In addition to seeking equitable relief in the form of possession \r\n  of items of personal property, Clotell asserted a legal cause of action for \r\n  conversion and sought damages in the amount of the funds received by Helen as \r\n  Robertâ€™s widow, and pre- and post-judgment interest.Â  Furthermore, Helen properly \r\n  endorsed upon her answer a demand for a jury trial.Â  See Rule 38(b), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  Helenâ€™s assertion of equitable defenses does not change the nature of \r\n  Clotellâ€™s conversion claim from an action at law to one in equity.Â  Rather, \r\n  such equitable defenses are equitable issues for determination by the court.Â  \r\n  See Hann v. Carolina Cas. Ins. Co., 252 S.C. 518, 526, 167 S.E.2d \r\n  420, 424 (1969).Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial judge erred in denying Helenâ€™s \r\n  request for a jury trial on Clotellâ€™s claim for conversion.Â  See Floyd, \r\n  306 S.C. at 379, 412 S.E.2d at 398-99.Â  \r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFailure to immediately appeal \r\n   \r\n\r\nClotell argues that Helen waived \r\n  her right to a jury trial by not immediately appealing the trial judgeâ€™s denial \r\n  of her request for a jury trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nNot only did the trial judge err \r\n  in finding Helen did not have a right to a jury trial, but he also erred in \r\n  finding the denial of a right to a jury trial is not immediately appealable.Â Â  \r\n  Orders of the trial judge denying a request for a jury trial involve the mode \r\n  of trial, affect substantial rights under section 14-3-330(2) of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2003), and are immediately appealable.Â  See Lester, \r\n  327 S.C. at 266, 491 S.E.2d at 241.Â  The failure to immediately appeal an order \r\n  affecting the mode of trial constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal these \r\n  issues.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Lester v. Dawson, 327 \r\n  S.C. 263, 491 S.E.2d 240 (1997), an attorney brought an action to collect attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees from a client.Â  The client made at least two pre-trial motions for a jury \r\n  trial.Â  The circuit court rejected the clientâ€™s motion for a jury trial and \r\n  placed the case on the non-jury roster.Â  The denial of the motion was not appealed \r\n  from; rather, the client renewed his motion that the case be transferred to \r\n  the jury roster at trial.Â  The circuit court found the question moot because \r\n  the client had not appealed from the previous order.Â  Id. atÂ  265, 491 \r\n  S.E.2d at 241.Â  The supreme court agreed, finding the client waived his right \r\n  to a jury trial by not immediately appealing the order denying his motion for \r\n  a jury trial.Â  \r\n Here, Helen had no opportunity to immediately \r\n  appeal from the trial judgeâ€™s sua sponte decision to hold a non-jury \r\n  trial because the trial was held that same day after only a brief recess.Â  When \r\n  Helen requested that the case be continued to allow her to appeal, the trial \r\n  judge refused her request, declaring that a right to a jury trial was not immediately \r\n  appealable.Â  Thus, while the judgeâ€™s denial of Helenâ€™s request for a jury trial \r\n  was immediately appealable, we find this case is not controlled by the waiver \r\n  principles expressed in Lester.\r\nMoreover, in other cases in which our \r\n  supreme court has required an immediate appeal from the denial of a jury trial, \r\n  the moving party had the opportunity to appeal when the trial court issued an \r\n  order of reference to a master-in-equity.Â  See, e.g., Edwards \r\n  v. Timmons, 297 S.C. 314, 316, 377 S.E.2d 97, 97 (1988) (holding that the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s unappealed order of reference to a master-in-equity became the \r\n  law of the case); Creed v. Stokes, 285 S.C. 542, 542-43, 313 S.E.2d 351, \r\n  351 (1985) (finding the appellant waived his objection to the order of reference \r\n  by not immediately appealing the order).Â  In this case, however, no order of \r\n  reference was ever issued.Â  Because the judge also denied Helenâ€™s motion to \r\n  hold the case in abeyance and because the non-jury trial proceeded shortly after \r\n  the judge made his erroneous finding that Helen had no right to a jury trial, \r\n  Helen had no meaningful opportunity to immediately appeal.Â  The judgeâ€™s denial \r\n  of Helenâ€™s motion to hold the trial in abeyance placed counsel in an untenable \r\n  position, as Helenâ€™s counsel could not both proceed with the trial and immediately \r\n  appeal the jury trial issue.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the purpose of requiring \r\n  an immediate appeal of the denial of the right to a jury trial is to preserve \r\n  a partyâ€™s constitutional rights that would otherwise be lost.Â  See generally \r\n  S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 14; S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-3-330(2) (1976).Â  In this case, \r\n  Helenâ€™s constitutional right to a trial by jury on the conversion issue was \r\n  lost through no fault of her own.Â  Helen made every effort to assert her right \r\n  to a jury trial and to immediately appeal the issue.Â  However, due to the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s errors, Helenâ€™s constitutional right to a trial by jury was lost.Â  As \r\n  a result, we find Helen did not waive her right to a jury trial because she \r\n  was afforded no opportunity to immediately appeal the issue.\r\nClotell asserted in oral argument that \r\n  Helen further waived her right to a jury trial by not appealing following the \r\n  non-jury trial. [2] Â  Specifically, \r\n  Clotell argues that Helen should have served a notice of appeal immediately \r\n  after the non-jury trial concluded rather than waiting until after the judge \r\n  issued a written order resolving the case.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs previously noted, the purpose of requiring \r\n  an immediate appeal is to preserve a partyâ€™s constitutional rights that would \r\n  otherwise be lost.Â  See generally S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 14; S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§14-3-330(2) (1976).Â  Here, Helenâ€™s constitutional right to a jury \r\n  trial was lost despite her best efforts to secure a jury trial.Â  Once the case \r\n  was tried non-jury, Helenâ€™s right to a jury trial had already been forfeited.Â  \r\n  Under these circumstances, we do not believe the policy behind requiring an \r\n  immediate appeal would have been furthered had Helen appealed at the conclusion \r\n  of the non-jury trial.Â Â  Moreover, once the case was tried non-jury, Helen arguably \r\n  was required to wait for a written order prior to appealing.Â  See Rule \r\n  203(b)(1), SCACR (â€œA notice of appeal shall be served on all respondents within \r\n  thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment \r\n  . . . .Â  When a form or other short order or judgment indicates that a more \r\n  full and complete order or judgment is to follow, a party need not appeal until \r\n  receipt of written notice of entry of the more complete order or judgment.â€); \r\n  Ford v. State Ethics Comâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) \r\n  (â€œThe written order is the trial judgeâ€™s final order and as such constitutes \r\n  the final judgment of the court.â€).Â  Thus, we find Helen preserved her right \r\n  to a jury trial by timely serving her notice of appeal after the final judgment. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial judge erred in denying Helenâ€™s \r\n  request for a jury trial and compounded that error when he ruled that the denial \r\n  of a right to a jury trial was not immediately appealable.Â  Because Helen had \r\n  no opportunity to appeal from the trial judgeâ€™s ruling prior to commencing the \r\n  non-jury trial, we hold she did not waive her right to a jury trial.Â  This case \r\n  presents both legal and equitable issues, and as such, the legal issues are \r\n  for determination by a jury and the equitable issues are for determination by \r\n  the court.Â  Floyd, 306 S.C. at 380, 412 S.E.2d at 399.Â  If both the legal \r\n  claims and the equitable claims are to be tried in a single proceeding, the \r\n  legal issues are to be determined first, and the findings of the jury are binding \r\n  on the court.Â  Johnson v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 292 S.C. 51, 55, \r\n  354 S.E.2d 895, 897 (1987).Â  Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial. [3] \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Batemanâ€™s claim for wrongful withholding arises from her assertion \r\n    that Rouse retained her property without authorization and after demand was \r\n    made.Â  This court can find no South Carolina case recognizing a cause of action \r\n    for wrongful withholding, as distinguished from conversion, except for an \r\n    action for the wrongful withholding of wages by an employer.Â  See e.g., \r\n    Kimbrell v. Jolog Sportswear, Inc., 239 S.C. 415, 420-21, 123 S.E.2d \r\n    524, 527 (1962) (discussing a cause of action for the tortious withholding \r\n    of wages due to an employee by the employer).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Helen did not file her notice of appeal until after she received \r\n    the judgeâ€™s written order, which was more than four months following the non-jury \r\n    trial.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Because we reverse and remand for a new trial on the denial of a \r\n    jury trial issue, we need not reach the partiesâ€™ remaining issues on appeal.Â  \r\n    See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. \r\n    598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling that an appellate court need \r\n    not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3793","title":"Pirayesh v.

Pirayesh (Husband) \r\n  and Mary Alice Pirayesh (Wife) were granted a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s \r\n  continuous separation without cohabitation. Husband was granted custody of the \r\n  partiesâ€™ two children, but was prohibited from traveling with the children outside \r\n  the United States. Wife was granted visitation rights and was ordered to pay \r\n  child support. The parties were ordered to split the guardian ad litem fees \r\n  and pay their own attorneyâ€™s fees. Both parties appeal this order. We affirm \r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband, who was born in Iran, \r\n  moved to the United States in 1978 and has since become a United States citizen.Â  \r\n  On June 11, 1984, he and Wife married. The parties had two children during their \r\n  marriage, a son, now fifteen years old, and a daughter, now thirteen years old. \r\n  Â Although Wife and children have always lived together in Greenville, \r\n  South Carolina, Husband worked for six months in Portland, Oregon in 1996 and \r\n  thereafter in Atlanta, Georgia until 1998. At the time of the divorce hearing \r\n  in March 2001, Husband had obtained a job in Charlotte, North Carolina, and \r\n  had been living there for approximately one year.Â  The children resided with \r\n  Wife during the coupleâ€™s one yearâ€™s separation as well as during the pendency \r\n  of this litigation.Â  \r\nHusband claims the marital breakdown was a result \r\n  of Wifeâ€™s inability to handle the family finances and the accrual of a large \r\n  amount of credit card debt.Â  When asked if he and Wife tried to budget their \r\n  money, Husband testified:\r\n\r\nYes, we did. . . . Like for example, we said we donâ€™t have \r\n  . . . certain money to spend on certain things. . . . [W]e said, if you are \r\n  going to make a long distance phone call letâ€™s just keep it under a hundred \r\n  dollars. . . . She did not follow that.Â  As a matter of fact, I have one conversation \r\n  that she had with her mom for a hundred and twenty minutes.Â  My ear get[s] hurt \r\n  after fifteen (15) minutes. . . . Grocer[ies] for example, you know.Â  We bought \r\n  grocer[ies]; thatâ€™s fine.Â  Half of the grocery throw away (sic). Either she \r\n  burned it cooking or she didnâ€™t like to eat left over food.\r\n\r\nHusband also testified that Wife had been un- or \r\n  under-employed for much of the marriage despite the fact that she has always \r\n  been in good health.Â  \r\nWife contended that the failure \r\n  of the marriage was largely a consequence of Husbandâ€™s emotional and physical \r\n  distance from her and the children, due namely to his out of town employment \r\n  and his preoccupation with playing tennis. According to Wife, the coupleâ€™s problems \r\n  began when, on the day of their daughterâ€™s birth, Wife called Husband to inform \r\n  him that their newborn had to be monitored because she had stopped breathing. \r\n  Wife testified as follows:\r\n\r\n[T]hat evening I had fed Debra, she stopped breathing.Â  And \r\n  I tried to wake her up.Â  And nothing was happening. . . . And I rang the nurseâ€™s \r\n  station from the bed. . . . They came and they got her to start breathing again.Â  \r\n  I called [Husband and] told him what had happened.Â  .Â  . . It was probably 10 \r\n  oâ€™clock when I called back.Â  And his response was, â€œ[Wife], I was asleep.â€Â  \r\n  And he hung up.\r\n\r\nWife testified that Husbandâ€™s response to their \r\n  daughterâ€™s health problems made her â€œwonder[] what kind of man [she] had marriedâ€ \r\n  and that their marital problems only increased from then on. \r\nBoth parties sought custody of \r\n  their two minor children.Â  During the presentation of Husbandâ€™s case, Husband \r\n  and three witnesses testified on his behalf.Â  The witnesses, all of whom knew \r\n  Husband through his tennis hobby, testified that both Husband and Wife \r\n  were loving parents. Husband testified that his primary reason for seeking custody \r\n  was because, during the pendency of the litigation, the water in the Wifeâ€™s \r\n  home was cut off twice, the phone was disconnected five times, and the electricity \r\n  was also turned off.Â  He also complained that Wife was late dropping the children \r\n  off to visit with him a number of times and that Wife did not effectively discipline \r\n  the children while they were in her care.Â  Husband felt he was the better parent \r\n  because he had a flexible job that paid $60,000 a year, he knew how to budget \r\n  his money, and he could control the children.Â  \r\nDuring the presentation of Wifeâ€™s case, \r\n  seven witnesses testified that Wife was a good parent. \r\n  [1] Â Â Â  One of those witnesses was a neighbor who has lived next door to \r\n  the couple for six years.Â  The neighbor testified that he and his wife had to \r\n  care for Wife after she had a hysterectomy because Husband was in Atlanta during \r\n  the week and playing tennis on the weekend. [2] Â  The neighbor also testified that Husband seemed \r\n  volatile with the children.Â  Another witness testified that she helped Wife \r\n  with her daughterâ€™s birthday party, and at the party, Husband complained to \r\n  the witness about Wife.Â  The witness testified that Husband seemed â€œvery alienated \r\n  and angry.â€Â  \r\nWife testified that, in addition to having \r\n  primary custody of the children during the coupleâ€™s separation, she had been \r\n  the primary caretaker for the children during the marriage.Â  In addition to \r\n  Husband working out of state for two-and-a-half years, she claimed Husband played \r\n  tennis five days a week, no matter what was going on in their childrenâ€™s lives. \r\n  [3] Â  She also testified that Husband gets agitated easily and that he was \r\n  always critical of her and the children.Â  \r\nWife testified that she has worked during \r\n  most of the marriage and that the periods during which she was unemployed occurred \r\n  when the children were newborns or when they were ill. [4] Â Â  While she admitted that she had trouble paying the utilities \r\n  during the partiesâ€™ separation, she pointed out that she and Husband were having \r\n  trouble paying their bills while they were a two-income family and that those \r\n  problems were amplified during the separation.Â  She further explained that she \r\n  missed several days of work during the partiesâ€™ separation when she severely \r\n  burned her leg from her knee to her hip, which put a further strain on her finances. \r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Wife was asked about \r\n  counseling appointments the children had missed. [5] Â  Wife explained that the December visit was rescheduled because \r\n  the counselor was on vacation.Â  Wife testified that she rescheduled the next \r\n  visit because she was working with a woman who was nine-and-a-half months pregnant, \r\n  and Wife felt she could not leave the woman alone.Â  On the third attempted visit, \r\n  Wife and children went to the office, but when they arrived, they found out \r\n  that the fee had increased from ten to fifteen dollars; when Wife did not have \r\n  the extra money, she was told she would have to reschedule.Â  On the fourth attempt \r\n  at rescheduling, the brakes on Wifeâ€™s car went out on the way to the appointment. \r\n\r\nWife was also asked about why the partiesâ€™ \r\n  daughter had not had a psychological evaluation, as previously ordered by the \r\n  family court, and why the daughter had missed three dentist appointments.Â  Wife \r\n  explained that she could not afford the psychological evaluation and Husband \r\n  would not help her pay for it because he did not agree that the daughter needed \r\n  to be evaluated.Â  As for the missed dentist appointments, Wife claimed daughter \r\n  had been ill. \r\nIn addition to custody of the children, \r\n  another major issue was whether or not Husband would be allowed to travel with \r\n  the children to Iran. When questioned about his desire to bring the children \r\n  to Iran, Husband explained he wanted his children to visit his parents and other \r\n  Iranian relatives.  [6]  However, he stressed that he had no desire \r\n  to relocate to Iran and said he wanted Wife to remain a major part of their \r\n  childrenâ€™s lives.Â  \r\nAccording to Wife, Husband threatened \r\n  on more than one occasion to move back to Iran and take the children with him.Â  \r\n  Wife offered the testimony of Christine Uhlman to show the inherent risks to \r\n  children in travel to Iran, the specific risks of parent/child abduction in \r\n  similar situations, and the lack of any legal remedy should this occur.Â  Due \r\n  to her extensive experience in this area, Uhlman was qualified by the court \r\n  as an expert witness on child abduction in the Middle East and the remedies \r\n  that might be available for people who find themselves in that predicament.Â  \r\n  The court found, however, that she did not have an adequate education or background \r\n  to be qualified as an expert on the law of Iran, and limited her qualification \r\n  to the topics listed above.Â  \r\nThe family court also heard the guardian ad litemâ€™s \r\n  final report concerning Husbandâ€™s travel outside of the United States and custody \r\n  of the two children. The guardian testified that she believed Wifeâ€™s fears that \r\n  Husband would abduct and relocate the children were baseless, but acknowledged \r\n  that travel restrictions may nevertheless be warranted.Â  She also testified \r\n  to some psychological, social, and physical problems of both the children and \r\n  her perception that these problems were not being adequately addressed.Â  The \r\n  guardian was also troubled by Wifeâ€™s apparent inability to meet the basic health \r\n  and day-to-day living needs of the children.Â  In her opinion, Husband appeared \r\n  to be in a better position to meet these needs and it was therefore in the best \r\n  interests of the children to grant him custody.Â  The guardian made this recommendation \r\n  to the court.Â  \r\nThe family court followed the guardianâ€™s custody \r\n  recommendation, granting Husband custody of both children and granting Wife \r\n  standard visitation rights.Â  The family court also prohibited Husband from taking \r\n  the children out of the United States.Â  The parties were ordered to pay for \r\n  their own attorneyâ€™s fees, and the cost of the guardian was split between them. \r\n  Both parties appeal this order.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Was the guardianâ€™s recommendation the product of an independent, balanced, and \r\n  impartial investigation?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the family court err in its reliance on the guardianâ€™s recommendation in \r\n  determining custody of the children?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the family court err by requiring each party to pay half of the guardian \r\n  ad litemâ€™s fees?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the family court err by ordering the parties to pay their own attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         V.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the family court err by restricting Husband from traveling outside of the \r\n  United States with the children?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the family court err in the apportionment of the marital debt?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has \r\n  jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, \r\n  244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This court, however, is not required to disregard the \r\n  family courtâ€™s findings; nor should we ignore the fact that the family court \r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their testimony.Â  Badeaux v.

App. 1997).Â  Because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for \r\n  direct observation of witnesses, it should give great deference to the family \r\n  courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved.Â  Kisling v.

Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  This is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best \r\n  interests of children. Id.; see also Cook v. Cobb, 271 \r\n  S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978) (stating that the welfare and best \r\n  interests of children are the primary, paramount, and controlling considerations \r\n  of the court in all child custody controversies).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nWife challenges the custody order by arguing: (1) \r\n  that the guardianâ€™s recommendation to the court was a product of an incomplete \r\n  and biased investigation; and (2) that the family court improperly relied on \r\n  the guardianâ€™s recommendation. We agree.Â  \r\nI. Was the guardianâ€™s recommendation the product of an independent, \r\n  balanced, and impartial investigation?\r\nIn Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. \r\n  281, 555 S.E.2d 386 (2001), the Supreme Court of South Carolina set the base \r\n  line standards for the responsibilities and duties of a guardian ad litem. Foremost \r\n  in the courtâ€™s list of duties, the guardian shall:\r\n\r\nâ€¦conduct an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation \r\n  to determine the facts relevant to the situation of the child and the family, \r\n  which should include: reviewing relevant documents; meeting with and observing \r\n  the child in the home setting and considering the childâ€™s wishes, if appropriate; \r\n  and interviewing parents, caregivers, and others with knowledge relevant to \r\n  the case.\r\n\r\nId. at 288, 555 S.E.2d at 390 (emphasis in \r\n  original); see also South Carolina Private Guardian Ad Litem Reform \r\n  Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1549 (Supp. 2003) (codifying the Patel guidelines \r\n  with more specificity, but only directly applicable to guardians ad litem appointed \r\n  after January 15, 2003).Â  \r\nIn Patel, \r\n  the guardianâ€™s investigation reflected overwhelmingly favorable treatment toward \r\n  the husband and negligible consideration of the wifeâ€™s capacity to competently \r\n  parent the children.Â  For example, the guardian contacted the husbandâ€™s attorney \r\n  nineteen times, but failed to contact the wifeâ€™s counsel once. The guardian \r\n  had frequent contact with the husband but minimal contact with the wife, and \r\n  the guardian only met with the children when they were with the husband.Â  The \r\n  guardian even secretly listened in on phone conversations between husband and \r\n  wife while visiting with the husband.Â  Id. at 286, 555 S.E.2d at 388-89.Â  \r\n  The Patel court held that the actions and inactions of the guardian so \r\n  tainted the decision of the family court that the wife was not afforded due \r\n  process, and the court remanded the issue of custody to the family court.Â  Id. \r\n  at 286-87, 291, 555 S.E.2d at 389, 391.Â  \r\nWe recognize that the case at hand is different \r\n  from Patel in that Wifeâ€™s argument stems, not from the guardianâ€™s incomplete \r\n  investigation of her, but rather from the guardianâ€™s allegedly superficial investigation \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s parenting abilities.Â  However, we believe the requirements set \r\n  forth in Patel were meant not only to protect the parents who are the \r\n  subjects of the guardianâ€™s investigation but also to ensure that the fate of \r\n  a childâ€™s living arrangements does not rest in the hands of a guardian whose \r\n  investigation is biased or otherwise incomplete.Â  Thus, a parent, whether the \r\n  focus of the guardianâ€™s investigation or largely ignored by the investigation, \r\n  may appeal a custody decision if that parent believes the family courtâ€™s order \r\n  was tainted by the guardianâ€™s improper investigation.\r\nHere, the guardian visited Wifeâ€™s home several \r\n  times to interview her and the children.Â  However, there is no indication that \r\n  she ever interviewed Husband and the children while they visited his home in \r\n  Charlotte.Â  Instead, she testified she met with him and the children at a McDonaldâ€™s \r\n  restaurant one time.Â  She further testified that she went to Charlotte to view \r\n  Husbandâ€™s residence and the schools the children would attend if custody was \r\n  changed and talked on one occasion to a college student who babysat the children \r\n  during their two-week summer visitation with Husband. \r\nThe guardian testified that her recommendation \r\n  was largely based upon the concerns of the childrenâ€™s counselor regarding counseling \r\n  appointments they had missed and a psychological evaluation that had still not \r\n  been scheduled for the partiesâ€™ daughter. Apparently, the guardian blamed \r\n  Wife for the missed appointments and did not believe Husband had any responsibility \r\n  to make sure these appointments were made.Â  However, the record indicates that \r\n  the counselor had sent a letter to both Husband and Wife about the missed counseling \r\n  sessions.Â  Furthermore, where Wife at least attempted to schedule a psychological \r\n  evaluation, there was no evidence that Husband did anything to ensure that the \r\n  evaluation was completed.Â  On cross-examination, the guardian was asked:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         [Y]ou have concerns too about the father . . . as far as \r\n  your investigations?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Right\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         But your concerns arenâ€™t listed necessarily on your report \r\n  because you didnâ€™t mention them in your report that you had concerns that the \r\n  father had not complied with the psychological evaluation for [the daughter], \r\n  and not attended counseling, and not attended co-parenting counseling, and has \r\n  also exposed the children as far as to more â€“ that both parents have exposed \r\n  the children to the divorce related issues.Â  So those arenâ€™t reflected on your \r\n  report on the second page that I was able to see?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Right\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen asked whether she wanted to explain why she \r\n  had not mentioned Husbandâ€™s shortcomings in her report, the guardian merely \r\n  stated that she did not omit them for any particular reason and again pointed \r\n  out that the children spent more time with Wife.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the record indicates that the guardian \r\n  was mistaken about some of the facts she reported to the family court.Â Â  For \r\n  instance, the guardian testified that the partiesâ€™ daughter had nine absences \r\n  from school, which contradicted Wifeâ€™s testimony.Â  However, at the hearing for \r\n  reconsideration, the school verified Wifeâ€™s assertion that daughter had five \r\n  absences. While this mistake by the guardian appeared to be inadvertent, the \r\n  guardian was adamant during her testimony that the daughter had four additional \r\n  unexcused absences. [7] Â Â  Thus, \r\n  the guardianâ€™s recommendation was at least partially biased because of her mistaken \r\n  belief that the daughter had several unexcused absences while in Wifeâ€™s care.\r\nBased on the guardianâ€™s superficial investigation of \r\n  Husband, her failure to hold Husband partially responsible for the children \r\n  not attending counseling, and her over-reporting the number of absences daughter \r\n  has had at school, we agree with Wife that the guardianâ€™s recommendation did \r\n  not result from a fair and impartial investigation.\r\nII. Did the family court err in its reliance on \r\n  the guardianâ€™s recommendation in determining custody of the children?\r\nIn determining the best interest of the \r\n  child in a custody dispute, the family court should consider several factors, \r\n  including: who has been the primary caretaker; the conduct, attributes, and \r\n  fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties (including the guardian, \r\n  expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and sex of the children.Â  \r\n  Patel, 347 S.C. at 285, 555 S.E.2d at 388.Â  Rather than merely adopting \r\n  the recommendation of the guardian, the court, by its own review of all the \r\n  evidence, should consider the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations \r\n  on the part of each parent as they impact the child as well as all psychological, \r\n  physical, environmental, spiritual, educational, medical, family, emotional \r\n  and recreational aspects of the childâ€™s life.Â  See Woodall v. Woodall, \r\n  322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996); Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. \r\n  411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1994); Wheeler v. Gill, 307 S.C. 94, 99, \r\n  413 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1992). When determining to whom custody shall \r\n  be awarded, the court should consider all the circumstances of the particular \r\n  case and all relevant factors must be taken into consideration.Â  Woodall, \r\n  322 S.C. at 11, 471 S.E.2d at 157 (1996); Ford v. Ford, 242 S.C. 344, \r\n  351, 130 S.E.2d 916, 921 (1963).\r\nA key component of the supreme courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to remand the custody order in Patel was the fact that â€œthe \r\n  custody question was hotly contested, with no clear choice for custodial parent \r\n  apparent from the testimony in the record.â€Â  347 S.C. at 286-87, 555 S.E.2d \r\n  at 389.Â  Since there were no substantial considerations made on record as to \r\n  the issue of custody apart from the guardianâ€™s recommendation, the court refused \r\n  to declare harmless the judgeâ€™s reliance on a biased guardianâ€™s report.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Here, a total of ten witnesses (not counting the Husband, Wife, and the guardian) \r\n  testified about each partyâ€™s parenting abilities.Â  All ten, three of whom were \r\n  called by Husband, described Wife as a loving and caring mother.Â  Five witnesses \r\n  testified that Husband was a capable parent, but two specifically questioned \r\n  his parenting ability. [8] Â  Thus, aside from Husband, the \r\n  guardian was the only witness who believed Husband was the better parent.\r\nBecause the family court obviously gave a great deal \r\n  of weight to the guardianâ€™s recommendation, which we have found was based on \r\n  a biased and incomplete investigation, we reverse the award of custody and remand \r\n  the case for a new custody hearing. [9] Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII. Did the trial court err by requiring Wife to pay half \r\n  of the guardianâ€™s fees?\r\nWife next argues that the family court erred by \r\n  requiring her to pay half of the guardianâ€™s fees because the guardian failed \r\n  to conduct an independent, balanced, and impartial investigation.Â  We reverse \r\n  and remand this issue to the family court.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-1553(B) of the South Carolina Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003) provides that a court-appointed guardian â€œis entitled to reasonable \r\n  compensation, subject to the review and approval of the court.â€Â  That subsection \r\n  goes on to list the following factors to guide family courts when awarding guardian \r\n  fees:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;the complexity of the issues before the court;\r\n (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;the contentiousness of the litigation;\r\n (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;the time expended by the guardian;\r\n (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;the expenses reasonably incurred by the guardian;\r\n (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;the financial ability of each party to pay fees and costs; and\r\n (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;any other factors the court considers necessary.\r\n\r\nWhile the ultimate work product of the guardian is not specifically \r\n  listed under section 20-7-1553, it certainly qualifies as another factor â€œthe \r\n  court considers necessary.â€Â  Thus, we remand this issue along with the issue \r\n  of custody.Â  Upon remand, the family court should consider the guardianâ€™s incomplete \r\n  investigation, along with the other factors listed in section 20-7-1553, in \r\n  determining the amount of fees owed to the guardian.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIV. Did the trial court err by restricting Husband from \r\n  traveling outside of the United States with the children?\r\nHusband first contends that the family \r\n  court erred in restricting his travel with the children because the court wrongfully \r\n  relied on testimony from Wifeâ€™s expert that went beyond her qualification as \r\n  an expert witness. We disagree.\r\nWifeâ€™s expert witness was qualified by \r\n  the court as an expert on child abduction in the Middle East and the remedies \r\n  that might be available for people who find themselves in that predicament.Â  \r\n  The court went on, however, to limit that qualification to those precise topics \r\n  and expressly held that she was not qualified as an expert on the law of Iran.Â  \r\n  Husband contends that her subsequent testimony on legal remedies for the recovery \r\n  of abducted children and the recognition of American passports in Iran was admitted \r\n  in error as it overstepped the limitations of her qualification as an expert.\r\nPermitting an expert witness to testify \r\n  beyond the scope of his or her expertise can constitute reversible error.Â  See \r\n  Nelson v. Taylor, 347 S.C. 210, 218, 553 S.E.2d 488, 492 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  We find, however, that the specific testimony at issue here fell within the \r\n  expertâ€™s qualification.Â  While the family court expressly found that the expert \r\n  witness was not an expert in the law of Iran, certain issues relating to that \r\n  law are so intertwined with the parameters of the expertâ€™s qualification as \r\n  to be manifestly compounded.Â  One would be hard pressed to discuss the remedies \r\n  for child abduction in Iran without at least tangentially touching on the law \r\n  of Iran.Â  Therefore, we find that Wifeâ€™s expert witnessâ€™s testimony fell within \r\n  that narrow area of Iranian law applicable to her qualification as an expert.\r\nSecond, Husband asserts error by the family \r\n  court on the merits of the restriction itself.Â  Citing cases from other jurisdictions \r\n  which held that fear of abduction and lack of foreign remedy, without more, \r\n  are an insufficient showing to reverse a family court on a custodial parentâ€™s \r\n  right to travel with his children, Husband argues that the family court erred \r\n  in limiting his right to leave the United States with his children.Â  See \r\n  Long v. Ardestani, 624 N.W.2d 405 (Wis. Ct. App. 2001) (finding that \r\n  difficulty of obtaining the return of the child in the event of abduction is \r\n  but one factor for a court to consider in imposing restrictions and deferring \r\n  to the family court); Al-Zouhayli v. Al-Zouhayli, 486 N.W.2d 10 (Minn. \r\n  Ct. App. 1992) (deferring to the family courtâ€™s decision not to restrict travel \r\n  despite threats of abduction and lack of Saudi remedies).Â Â  We disagree with \r\n  this argument as well.Â  \r\nThe prevailing rule gleaned from the cases \r\n  to which Husband cites is that appellate courts generally defer to a family \r\n  courtâ€™s decision regarding a parentâ€™s ability to travel with his or her children. \r\n  We agree with the Wisconsin Court of Appeals that:\r\n\r\nWe are satisfied that the standard \r\n  of the best interests of the child, comprehensive as it is, permits a full consideration \r\n  of concerns both about a parentâ€™s intention in abducting a child and about the \r\n  lack of a remedy should that occur. We are also satisfied that there is no need \r\n  to alter the deference appellate courts give to trial courtsâ€™ decisions on a \r\n  childâ€™s best interests in order to insure a full consideration of those concerns.\r\n\r\nLong, 624 N.W.2d at 417-18.\r\nAt trial, Wife presented evidence of both \r\n  specific threats by Husband to relocate the children to Iran as well as testimony \r\n  concerning the inherent dangers in these types of situations.Â  Testimony was \r\n  also presented regarding the generalized dangers in travel with children born \r\n  of Iranian descent to that country and the possibility that Husband could easily \r\n  fly from another country into Iran if he was allowed to travel with the children \r\n  outside the United States.Â  Furthermore, even if Husband had every intention \r\n  to return the children after their visit to Iran, if he were to become incapacitated \r\n  while he and the children were there, Wife could do very little to retrieve \r\n  the children.Â  Based on the evidence regarding Husbandâ€™s threats, the risks \r\n  of abduction, and the lack of legal recourse in a country which is not a signatory \r\n  to the Hague Convention, we affirm the family court order banning Husband from \r\n  travel with the children outside the United States. \r\nV. Did the family court err in the apportionment of the \r\n  marital debt?\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in not equally \r\n  splitting the partiesâ€™ debts between them. He contends that since all the debt \r\n  was accrued during the marriage, the entirety of the debt should be split between \r\n  the parties regardless of whose name it is in.Â  We disagree.\r\nMarital debt should be divided in accord with \r\n  the same principles used in the division of marital property and must be factored \r\n  into the totality of equitable apportionment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 \r\n  (Supp. 2003); Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 103, 545 S.E.2d 531, 539 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001); Thomas v. Thomas, 346 S.C. 20, 27, 550 S.E.2d 580, 584 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The apportionment of marital property is within the discretion \r\n  of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Thomas v. Thomas, 346 S.C. 20, 27, 550 S.E.2d 580, 584 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n\r\nThere are many factors which the family court \r\n  may consider in the apportionment of marital property.Â  On review, the appellate \r\n  court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result \r\n  is equitable, the fact that the appellate court may have weighed specific factors \r\n  differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  296 S.C. 289, 300-301, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In this review, \r\n  our focus is on whether the family court addressed the statutory factors governing \r\n  apportionment with sufficiency for us to conclude that the court was cognizant \r\n  of these factors.Â  Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nIn its final order, the family court noted the \r\n  income of each party, the absence of an alimony grant to Wife and her duty to \r\n  pay child support, the sale of the marital residence, the tax benefits of the \r\n  apportionment to each party, and the child custody arrangements. Because these \r\n  specific findings of the family court comport with those considerations mandated \r\n  by section 20-7-472, we are satisfied that the court was, in fact, cognizant \r\n  of the statutory factors of marital apportionment when allocating the marital \r\n  debt between the parties. Therefore, the family court acted within its discretion \r\n  in ordering Husband to pay all debts held in his name.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family \r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Two of Wifeâ€™s witnesses testified that Husband was a fine parent \r\n    as well. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  After Husband testified on direct that Wife had no health problems, \r\n    he was specifically asked on cross-examination about Wifeâ€™s hysterectomy.Â  \r\n    Husband claimed he did not know she had one.Â  Wife testified she had a hysterectomy \r\n    in December of 1997, before the parties separated.Â  Husband then returned \r\n    to the stand on reply, recalled the hysterectomy, and claimed he took nine \r\n    days off from work in order to care for her and the children.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  During Husbandâ€™s cross-examination, he admitted \r\n    playing tennis every other day during the marriage.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The partiesâ€™ son had ear problems when he was \r\n    little and now cannot hear out of his right ear.Â  Their daughter was born \r\n    with three kidneys.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The children had seen the counselor regularly from June 2000 to November \r\n    2000; however, at the time of the divorce hearing, they had not been to a \r\n    session in four months.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  Husbandâ€™s father is ninety-one \r\n    years old; thus, travel by him to America is not feasible. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  In fact, the daughter did not have any unexcused absences.Â  When \r\n    questioning the guardian, Wifeâ€™s attorney attempted to explain that the lower \r\n    case â€œuâ€™sâ€ on the daughterâ€™s attendance record denoted a tardy; however, the \r\n    guardian stated: â€œYour eyes might be better than mine.Â  I canâ€™t â€“ I just see \r\n    it as a U.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  The partiesâ€™ next-door neighbor testified that Husband seemed volatile \r\n    with the children.Â  Another witness described Husband as â€œvery alienated and \r\n    angry.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Because we remand the issue of custody, we also remand the issue \r\n    of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3794","title":"State v.

Clare, Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles \r\n  H. Richardson, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Richard Shawn Pipkin was convicted \r\n  of attempted first-degree burglary and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended on service of ten years confinement and five years probation.Â  He \r\n  appeals this conviction, claiming error by the trial court in disallowing testimony \r\n  regarding the victimâ€™s alleged bias and denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nPatsy Cribb and Pipkin began dating in \r\n  November 1998.Â  In March 1999, Pipkin moved into Cribbâ€™s apartment.Â  \r\n  By July, their relationship had become unstable and there were instances of \r\n  physical abuse.Â  Cribb moved out of the shared apartment in August.Â  \r\nIn January 2000, Cribb moved into an apartment \r\n  in the home of her sister and brother-in-law (Richardsons).Â  After moving in \r\n  with the Richardsons, Cribb began seeing Pipkin â€œoccasionally.â€Â  Â \r\nAccording to Pipkin, he and Cribb began seeing \r\n  each other four to five times a week and renewed the sexual aspect of their \r\n  relationship after Cribb moved in with her sister. \r\n  [1] Â  Pipkin alleges he and Cribb arranged a method of entry whereby Pipkin \r\n  would use one of two metal wires stashed on the porch to knock away the inside \r\n  boards holding the doors in a locked position and let himself in.Â  Pipkin stated \r\n  that he utilized this method of entry about â€œtwenty or thirtyâ€ times.Â  Cribb \r\n  denied any arrangement for Pipkin to visit her at this apartment.Â  \r\nMonths after Cribb moved to the Richardsonsâ€™ apartment, \r\n  her relationship with Pipkin once again grew volatile.Â  On September 13, 2000, \r\n  there was an episode of physical abuse. Cribb obtained a restraining order against \r\n  Pipkin barring him from any contact with her.Â  Â \r\nOn October 27, 2000, Cribb went to a local bar \r\n  and was talking with another man when Pipkin entered.Â  Pipkin approached the \r\n  two of them, threw a drink in Cribbâ€™s face, and was escorted off the premises \r\n  by the barâ€™s bouncers.Â  Â \r\nLater that night, Pipkin drove to Cribbâ€™s apartment \r\n  and parked down the street away from the apartment.Â  According to \r\n  Pipkin, he approached the apartment, knocked, and, because he could \r\n  not tell if Cribb was home, attempted to enter using the wire method for entry \r\n  as discussed above. While attempting to enter, Pipkin heard Richardson exiting \r\n  the home.Â  Richardson was aroused out of sleep by â€œscratching noisesâ€ under \r\n  his bedroom window.Â  Once Pipkin saw Richardson, Pipkin â€œeased offâ€ and \r\n  walked away from the doors.Â  Â Â Pipkin fled to his truck and waited.Â  \r\n  Richardson inspected the home and found severe damage to both a downstairs window \r\n  and a steel door (neither a part of the sliding glass doors).Â  Richardson woke \r\n  Cribb and the police were called.Â  The police remained at the home for about \r\n  two hours.Â  \r\nCribb returned to her bed shortly after the police \r\n  left.Â  Soon thereafter, she heard metal wire beating against the sliding glass \r\n  doors.Â  She entered her sisterâ€™s apartment through an internal stairwell and \r\n  woke Richardson.Â  The two of them inspected the home and found a metal rod stuck \r\n  in the sliding glass door.Â  Once again the police were called.Â  This time they \r\n  arrived with Pipkin, whom they had detained a few blocks from the home.Â  One \r\n  of Pipkinâ€™s shoes was found near the home.Â  Metal rods were found in his truck \r\n  which matched the type found lodged in the sliding glass door.Â  Richardson positively \r\n  identified Pipkin and claimed that Pipkin admitted to him his attempted entry \r\n  into the house and offered to pay for the damages.Â  Pipkin was arrested.\r\nWhile being detained at the Georgetown Detention \r\n  Center, Pipkin was transported to a dental clinic.Â  Also on board was inmate \r\n  Joseph Allen (â€œAllenâ€).Â  Allen testified that he and Pipkin discussed Pipkinâ€™s \r\n  case on the way to the dentist.Â  He stated that Pipkin admitted to attempting \r\n  the break-in for the purpose of killing Cribb if she was with another man.Â  \r\n  His testimony included several corroborating details of the events of October \r\n  27, 2000. He claimed that, prior to trial, he had discussed the facts of the \r\n  case with no one but Pipkin.Â  \r\nPipkin was released on bond pending trial with strict \r\n  orders not to contact Cribb.Â  Cribb, nevertheless, visited Pipkinâ€™s apartment \r\n  to talk with him the Friday after his release.Â  After this meeting, they again \r\n  began having a secret love affair, meeting four to five times a week.Â  During \r\n  this rekindled relationship, there was another incident of severe physical abuse.Â  \r\n\r\nAt some point, Cribb allegedly broke into Pipkinâ€™s \r\n  trailer home and damaged some items.Â  Cribb denied these allegations, but admitted \r\n  at Pipkinâ€™s trial that she was jailed for the incident.Â  The judge also allowed \r\n  testimony from Pipkinâ€™s two brothers regarding this damage and Cribbâ€™s presence \r\n  at the trailer at the time of the damage.Â  During the examination of Pipkinâ€™s \r\n  father, however, the judge sustained objections to similar testimony on the \r\n  ground of relevance.Â  \r\nPipkin was convicted on one count of attempted first-degree \r\n  burglary. This appeal follows.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the trial court err in disallowing Pipkin to present evidence of \r\n  the victimâ€™s bias? \r\n   \r\n\r\nPipkin contends that the trial court erred \r\n  in excluding the testimony of Pipkinâ€™s father in relation to the alleged break-in \r\n  and resulting property damage caused by Cribb.Â  He argues that, since this testimony \r\n  would attack the credibility of a witness and show bias, it was relevant evidence \r\n  and should have been admitted.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, the admission of trial testimony \r\n  is within the discretion of the trial judge and, absent an abuse of this discretion \r\n  and resulting prejudice, will not be reversed by a reviewing court.Â Â  See \r\n  State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 428, 462 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1995); State \r\n  v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 355, 543 S.E.2d 586, 592 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe initial determination a trial judge makes in deciding \r\n  whether to admit testimony is its relevance to the case before the court.Â  Relevant \r\n  evidence is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact \r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less \r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œProof of \r\n  bias is almost always relevant because the jury, as finder of fact and weigher \r\n  of credibility, has historically been entitled to assess all evidence which \r\n  might bear on the accuracy and truth of a witnessâ€™ testimony.â€Â  U.S. v. Abel, \r\n  469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 469 (1984).\r\nÂ Even relevant evidence may be excluded on the grounds \r\n  of its competency.Â  See Hamilton, 344 S.C. at 355, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  at 592. For instance, relevant evidence may be excluded â€œif its probative value \r\n  is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of \r\n  the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste \r\n  of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\n  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the competency of testimony under this rule \r\n  should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances and this court is obligated \r\n  to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.Â  Hamilton, 344 \r\n  S.C. at 358, 543 S.E.2d at 593-94.Â  This decision to exclude evidence under \r\n  Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate court believes it \r\n  would have decided the matter otherwise. Id.\r\nRegardless of whether the trial judge abused his broad \r\n  discretion in excluding Pipkinâ€™s fatherâ€™s testimony, the error was harmless \r\n  as the evidence was cumulative.Â  See State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. \r\n  302, 319, 513 S.E.2d 606, 614 (1999) (opining erroneous exclusion of cumulative \r\n  evidence is harmless).Â  Pipkin sought to show Cribbâ€™s bias through his fatherâ€™s \r\n  testimony that his father acquired an arrest warrant for Cribbâ€™s allegedly burglarizing \r\n  and damaging his mobile home.Â Â Â  \r\nThe jury heard testimony from multiple witnesses as \r\n  to Cribbâ€™s alleged break-in and property damage to Pipkinâ€™s trailer.Â  Although \r\n  Cribb denied having damaged the trailer, she admitted that Pipkinâ€™s father had \r\n  her arrested for this damage.Â  Not only did Cribb testify regarding the damage \r\n  to the mobile home, Pipkinâ€™s brothers testified to seeing Cribb attempting to \r\n  break into the trailer, and seeing the resulting damage.Â  Since allegations \r\n  of Cribbâ€™s wrongdoing were previously presented to the jury, it was within the \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s discretion to exclude Pipkinâ€™s fatherâ€™s testimony as cumulative.Â  \r\n  See Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Even if excluded in error, the exclusion of evidence \r\n  which would be merely cumulative to other evidence presented to the jury is \r\n  harmless.Â  See State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d \r\n  859, 862 (1993); State v. White, 353 S.C. 566, 575, 578 S.E.2d 728, 733 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the trial court err in the denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict? \r\n   \r\n\r\nBecause evidence was presented at \r\n  trial showing that Cribb consented to his presence in her home, Pipkin claims \r\n  that the elements of attempted burglary were not proven by the State and, therefore, \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn a motion for directed verdict, the trial \r\n  court is concerned with the existence of evidence rather than its weight.Â  State \r\n  v. Spann, 279 S.C. 399, 402, 308 S.E.2d 518, 520 (1983).Â  This evidence \r\n  is â€œviewed in the light most favorable to the State to determine whether there \r\n  is any evidence, either direct or circumstantial which reasonably tends \r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which guilt may be fairly and logically \r\n  deduced.â€ State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 83-83, 441 S.E.2d 635, 638 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the case at bar, testimony was presented \r\n  by both sides on the issue of consent.Â  Pipkin testified to an agreement with \r\n  Cribb whereby he could â€œbreak-inâ€ to Cribbâ€™s apartment whenever he so desired.Â  \r\n  Cribb testified that there was no such agreement and that she had taken out \r\n  a restraining order against Pipkin at the time of the attempted burglary.Â  Nowhere \r\n  in the record is evidence reflecting any specific consent to enter the apartment \r\n  on the evening in question.Â  \r\nIt is the duty of the trial judge, when ruling \r\n  on a motion for a directed verdict, to submit the case to the jury when there \r\n  is any substantial evidence, either direct or circumstantial, which reasonably \r\n  tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, \r\n  77, 480 S.E.2d 64, 71 (1997).Â  Since there was conflicting evidence presented \r\n  on the issue of consent, the trial judge acted properly in denying Pipkinâ€™s \r\n  motion and submitting the case to the jury.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of \r\n  the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Cribbâ€™s sister and Richardson forbade her to see \r\n    Pipkin. Accordingly, he would sneak into the apartment to avoid being seen \r\n    by them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3795","title":"State v.

Stephen Welch, of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\nDeputy Director for Legal Services Teresa A. Knox, Legal \r\n  Counsel Tommy Evans, Jr., and Legal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, all of South \r\n  Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:&nbsp; Gary Thomas Hill \r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision revoking his probation and sentencing him \r\n  to seven years imprisonment.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 4, 1991, Hill was convicted of second-degree \r\n  arson, second-degree burglary, malicious injury to personal property, driving \r\n  under the influence (fourth offense), and criminal domestic violence (third \r\n  offense).Â  The judge sentenced Hill to twenty years imprisonment, suspended \r\n  upon the service of ten years and five years probation.Â  Hill was granted parole \r\n  on July 28, 1996.Â  His parole ended on February 25, 1997, and his probation \r\n  began immediately thereafter.Â  When the events that are the subject of this \r\n  appeal took place, Hill had completed approximately four years and eight months \r\n  of his probation. \r\nOn October 24, 2001, Hillâ€™s probation \r\n  officer, Marshall Evans, received a call from the Department of Social Services \r\n  (â€œDSSâ€).Â  DSS informed Evans that it had reason to believe Hill possessed firearms \r\n  and had been pointing them at his son.Â  To further investigate this information, \r\n  Evans called Hill and asked him to come to his office.Â  Hill went to see Evans \r\n  as requested on October 25, 2001. \r\nEvans confronted Hill with the information \r\n  received by DSS and asked whether he did in fact possess any weapons.Â  Hill \r\n  admitted that his son owned a .22 caliber rifle, which he had received for his \r\n  birthday.Â  Hill agreed to let Evans and other probation officers search his \r\n  house for weapons, but the agreed upon search never took place. \r\nWhile in Evansâ€™s office, Hill asked if \r\n  he could get a drink of water.Â  Evans agreed and accompanied Hill as he went \r\n  into the hallway.Â Â  After getting some water, Hill turned and headed down the \r\n  hall towards the exit.Â  Although Evans asked Hill to stop, he did not respond \r\n  and instead proceeded out of the building where he locked himself in his car.Â  \r\n  Evans testified that at least three other probation officers were involved in \r\n  trying to â€œchaseâ€ Hill down. \r\nThe officers surrounded Hillâ€™s car and \r\n  attempted to gain entry.Â  Despite the officersâ€™ commands to stop, Hill began \r\n  to drive out of the parking lot notwithstanding the proximity of the officers \r\n  to his car.Â  At this point, two of the officers opened fire on Hillâ€™s car.Â  \r\n  Hillâ€™s car was hit several times in numerous places including the rear window, \r\n  the side window, the trunk, and the rear quarter panel.Â  Hill received three \r\n  gunshot wounds, one in the head and two in the back.Â  Although the officers \r\n  shot Hill three times, he never stopped his car.Â  He was arrested some time \r\n  later while seeking treatment at a hospital. \r\nHill hired attorney James Brislane to \r\n  represent him at the probation revocation hearing.Â  On November 1, 2001, Brislane \r\n  filed motions under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and Brady v. Maryland. \r\n  [1] Â  Hill asserts on appeal these motions were filed to determine exactly \r\n  what happened on the day of the incident.Â  Hill believed he was entitled to \r\n  the following:Â Â  (1) the names of witnesses that supported his version of the \r\n  incident; (2) written statements of the probation agents; (3) Anderson City \r\n  Police Department investigative materials; and (4) the South Carolina Law Enforcement \r\n  Division (â€œSLEDâ€) report. \r\nOn November 11, 2001, Brislane moved for a continuance \r\n  of the probation revocation hearing.Â  At the hearing on the motion, the court \r\n  informed Brislane that because the probation and parole departmentâ€™s records \r\n  were confidential, [2]  neither a Rule 5 motion nor a Brady \r\n  motion were appropriate for obtaining the requested information.Â  The court \r\n  instructed Brislane to find the statute applicable to the parole departmentâ€™s \r\n  records and to serve the appropriate motion on counsel.Â  The court also informed \r\n  Brislane it would hear the motion once correctly made.Â  \r\nThe record does not disclose any motions made according \r\n  to the courtâ€™s instructions prior to the probation revocation hearing, which \r\n  was held on December 21, 2001.Â  Neither the SLED report outlining the investigation \r\n  of the incident nor the Anderson Police Departmentâ€™s report was furnished to \r\n  Hill or his counsel prior to the hearing. \r\nAt the revocation hearing, the circuit court and \r\n  Brislane agreed the key issue was not whether Hill violated his probation, but \r\n  whether he violated his probation willfully. \r\n  [3] Â  All of the officers involved in the incident testified at the hearing.Â  \r\n  The majority of the testimony presented consisted of the officersâ€™ assertions \r\n  that Hill intentionally tried to run them over during his escape.Â  On cross-examination \r\n  of each witness, Brislane tried to discredit the idea that Hill intentionally \r\n  attempted to harm the officers. Â However, at the conclusion of the hearing, \r\n  the court revoked Hillâ€™s probation and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment.\r\nFollowing the revocation hearing, Hill hired Beattie \r\n  Ashmore to represent him.Â  Ashmore filed a motion to reconsider on December \r\n  28, 2001.Â  In the motion, Ashmore asked the court to reconsider the ruling based \r\n  on the fact that the SLED report investigating the incident was not complete \r\n  and the report contained mitigating information. \r\nÂ After filing the motion to reconsider, Ashmore \r\n  made several additional motions in an attempt to obtain the SLED report.Â  These \r\n  motions included a motion to produce, another motion pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP, \r\n  and another Brady motion.Â  Ashmore also served subpoenas on SLED and \r\n  the Anderson County Solicitorâ€™s Office.Â  Due to these efforts, Hill received \r\n  the SLED report prior to the hearing on the motion to reconsider. \r\nAt the hearing, the circuit court asked \r\n  Ashmore whether he was proceeding under Rule 28 or Rule 29, SCRCrimP. [4] Â  After a brief colloquy, the court informed \r\n  counsel that he could not proceed under both so he would have to elect.Â  Ashmore \r\n  chose to proceed under Rule 29.Â  Relying on the information in the SLED report, \r\n  Ashmore presented evidence that countered the probation officersâ€™ assertions \r\n  that Hill intentionally tried to hit them with his vehicle. \r\nIn an order dated July 3, 2002, the court denied \r\n  Hillâ€™s motion on the ground that he failed to meet the five elements required \r\n  to support the award of a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the court ruled that even considering the additional evidence presented, the \r\n  outcome would not change if a new hearing were permitted.Â  As such, the court \r\n  upheld its previously imposed sentence of seven years.Â Â  Hill appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether or not to revoke probation \r\n  is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  State v. Proctor, 345 S.C. 299, \r\n  301, 546 S.E.2d 673, 674 (Ct. App. 2001). â€œ[B]efore revoking probation, the \r\n  circuit judge must determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish the \r\n  probationer has violated his probation conditions.â€ State v. Lee, 350 \r\n  S.C. 125, 131, 564 S.E.2d 372, 375 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThis courtâ€™s authority \r\n  to review such a decision is confined to correcting errors of law unless the \r\n  lack of a legal or evidentiary basis indicates the circuit judgeâ€™s decision \r\n  was arbitrary and capricious.â€Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 647, \r\n  511 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1999); see State v. Brown, 284 S.C. \r\n  407, 410, 326 S.E.2d 410, 411 (1985) (holding judges are â€œallowed a wide, but \r\n  not unlimited, discretion in imposing conditions of suspension or probation \r\n  and they cannot impose conditions which are illegal and void as against public \r\n  policyâ€).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Brady \r\n  and Rule 5 Motions\r\nHill argues the circuit court erred by not requiring \r\n  the State to produce the information requested through the Rule 5 and Brady \r\n  motions prior to the probation revocation hearing.Â  \r\nâ€œThe rules encompassed in Brady, and its \r\n  progeny, and Rule 5 are separate and impose different duties.Â  Therefore, separate \r\n  analysis must be used to determine if either has been violated.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 452, 503 S.E.2d 214, 219 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d, \r\n  337 S.C. 617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999).\r\nâ€œA Brady claim is based upon the requirement of due \r\n  process.Â  Such a claim is complete if the accused can demonstrate (1) the evidence \r\n  was favorable to the accused, (2) it was in the possession of or known to the \r\n  prosecution, (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and (4) it was material \r\n  to guilt or punishment.â€Â  Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  320, 324 (1999).Â  â€œThis rule applies to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory \r\n  evidence.â€Â  Id.  \r\nâ€œThe requirements of Rule 5, as opposed to the constitutional \r\n  dictates of Brady, are judicially created discovery mechanisms for use \r\n  in criminal proceedings.â€Â  State v. Proctor, 348 S.C. 322, 330, 559 S.E.2d \r\n  318, 322 (Ct. App. 2001), revâ€™d on other grounds, Op. No. 25810 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed Apr. 19, 2004)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 34).Â  Although Hillâ€™s \r\n  counsel proceeded under several provisions of Rule 5, the primary subsection \r\n  was Rule 5(a)(1)(C).Â  This subsection provides:\r\n\r\n(C) Documents and Tangible Objects.Â  Upon request of the \r\n  defendant the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy books, \r\n  papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies \r\n  or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of \r\n  the prosecution, and which are material to the preparation of his defense or \r\n  are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in chief at the trial, or \r\n  were obtained from or belong to the defendant.\r\n\r\nRule 5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP.\r\nâ€œThe definition of â€˜materialâ€™ for purposes of Rule 5 is the \r\n  same as the definition used in the Brady context.â€Â  Kennerly, \r\n  331 S.C. at 453, 503 S.E.2d at 220.Â  â€œImpeachment or exculpatory evidence is \r\n  material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been \r\n  disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 241, 471 S.E.2d 689, 693 (1996).\r\nThe application of the discovery rules in the context \r\n  of a probation revocation hearing is a novel issue in this state.Â  Although \r\n  our appellate courts have found the rules to be applicable in â€œcriminal proceedings,â€ \r\n  the specific types of criminal proceedings have not been defined.Â  See \r\n  Kennerly, 331 S.C. at 453, 503 S.E.2d at 220Â  (â€œThe requirements of Rule \r\n  5, as opposed to the constitutional dictates of Brady, are judicially \r\n  created discovery mechanisms for use in criminal proceedings.â€); see also \r\n  Rule 5, SCRCrimP (titled â€œDisclosure in Criminal Casesâ€).Â  The text of Rule \r\n  5 and the theoretical underpinnings of Brady appear to suggest that these \r\n  disclosure rules are only applicable in criminal trials.Â  In this state, however, \r\n  these rules have not been so limited.\r\nAside from trial proceedings, our research reveals these \r\n  rules have been extended to apply to guilty plea and sentencing proceedings.Â  \r\n  See Gibson, 334 S.C. at 525, 514 S.E.2d at 325 (â€œThe standard \r\n  for deciding the materiality of a Brady violation in the context of a \r\n  guilty plea is a novel issue in South Carolina.Â  We adopt the standard applied \r\n  by other courts, which essentially is the same standard that is applied in the \r\n  context of a trial:Â  A Brady violation is material when there is a reasonable \r\n  probability that, but for the governmentâ€™s failure to disclose Brady \r\n  evidence, the defendant would have refused to plead guilty and gone to trial.â€); \r\n  State v. Gulledge, 321 S.C. 399, 402, 468 S.E.2d 665, 667 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (discussing and implicitly recognizing the application of Rule 5 and Brady \r\n  in the context of sentencing proceedings), affâ€™d as modified, 326 S.C. \r\n  220, 487 S.E.2d 590 (1997).Â Â  The application of these two rules is not, however, \r\n  without limitation.Â  See State v. McCoy, 285 S.C. 115, 116, 328 \r\n  S.E.2d 620, 621 (1985) (declining to apply Brady in the context of a \r\n  family court transfer hearing given the hearing was not a trial and was not \r\n  a preliminary determination of guilt).\r\nIn order to determine whether these disclosure \r\n  rules apply to a probationer, we find it instructive to consider two United \r\n  States Supreme Court decisions analyzing the due process requirements for parole \r\n  and probation revocation.Â  See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 \r\n  (1973); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972).Â  \r\nIn Morrissey, the United States Supreme Court considered \r\n  whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the State \r\n  to afford an individual some opportunity to be heard prior to the revocation \r\n  of his parole. Â Id. at 472.Â  In answering this question, the Court first \r\n  considered the â€œfunction of parole in the correctional process.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 477.Â  Because â€œthe revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution,â€ \r\n  the Court concluded, â€œthe full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding \r\n  does not apply to parole revocations.â€Â  Id. at 480.Â  The Court did, however, \r\n  find that a parolee is entitled to due process to a limited extent.Â  \r\nSpecifically, the Court held that after arrest a parolee \r\n  is entitled to a preliminary hearing â€œto determine whether there is probable \r\n  cause or reasonable ground to believe that the arrested parolee has committed \r\n  acts that would constitute a violation of parole conditions.â€Â  Morrissey, \r\n  408 U.S. at 485.Â  Additionally, the Court found the parolee was also entitled \r\n  to a revocation hearing during which he would have â€œan opportunity to be heard \r\n  and to show, if he can, that he did not violate the conditions, or, if he did, \r\n  that circumstances in mitigation suggest that the violation does not warrant \r\n  revocation.â€Â  Id. at 488.Â  In terms of the specific procedural requirements \r\n  for due process, the Court listed several, including:Â  disclosure to the parolee \r\n  of evidence against him; the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses; \r\n  a written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and the \r\n  reasons for revoking parole.Â  Id. at 489. Â \r\nThe next year, the United States Supreme Court \r\n  extended the analysis in Morrissey to hold that a probationer is also \r\n  guaranteed due process.Â  Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973).Â  The \r\n  Court concluded, â€œ[p]robation revocation, like parole revocation, is not a stage \r\n  of a criminal prosecution, but does result in a loss of liberty.â€ Id. \r\n  at 782.Â  The Court explained, â€œa probationer can no longer be denied due processâ€ \r\n  on the ground that â€œprobation is an â€˜act of grace.â€™â€ Gagnon, 411 U.S. \r\n  at 782 n.4.Â Â Â  \r\nIn light of this precedent, we must determine whether \r\n  a probationer facing revocation is entitled to discovery based on these due \r\n  process rights.Â  State courts are divided on this issue. \r\n  [5] Â  See Bobbi J. Anello, Annotation, Availability of Discovery \r\n  At Probation Revocation Hearings, 52 A.L.R. 5th 559 (1997 &amp; Supp. 2003) \r\n  (analyzing cases in which the courts have considered the availability of discovery \r\n  to probationers at their revocation hearings).Â  As discussed in the above-referenced \r\n  article, there are primarily two grounds for which discovery is permitted in \r\n  probation revocation cases.Â  \r\nSome jurisdictions have adopted the view that discovery in \r\n  revocation proceedings is permissible based on a constitutional due process \r\n  right.Â  The courts in these cases have followed the reasoning outlined in Morrissey \r\n  and Gagnon.Â  See, e.g., Kanuck v. Meehan, 798 P.2d 420 \r\n  (Ariz. Ct. App. 1990); People v. Boykin, 631 P.2d 1149 (Colo. Ct. App. \r\n  1981); Hines v. State, 358 So. 2d 183 (Fla. 1978); Piper v. State, \r\n  770 N.E.2d 880 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002); Reiter v. Camp, 518 S.W.2d 82 (Mo. \r\n  Ct. App. 1974); People v. Adams, 367 N.Y.S.2d 67 (N.Y. App. Div. 1975).Â  \r\n  The jurisdictions that have rejected this concept do so on the theory that if \r\n  a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to discovery, then \r\n  a probationer should not be entitled to greater rights than a defendant at trial.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Irby v. State, 455 So. 2d 271 (Ala. Crim. App. 1984); \r\n  People v. King, 152 Cal. Rptr. 566 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1979); State \r\n  v. Hass, 758 P.2d 713 (Idaho Ct. App. 1988); People v. DeWitt, 397 \r\n  N.E.2d 1385 (Ill. 1979); Commonwealth v. Quinlan, 380 A.2d 854 (Pa. Super. \r\n  Ct. 1977), affâ€™d, 412 A.2d 494 (Pa. 1980).Â  \r\nTaking a different approach, some jurisdictions have held \r\n  that state criminal discovery rules, comparable to our Rule 5, are applicable \r\n  in probation revocation hearings.Â  See, e.g., State v. Quelnan, \r\n  767 P.2d 243 (Haw. 1989); State v. Barton, 803 P.2d 1020 (Idaho Ct. App. \r\n  1991).Â  In contrast, a number of jurisdictions have rejected this view on the \r\n  ground that a probation revocation hearing is not a â€œcriminal trialâ€ and, thus, \r\n  the criminal rules of discovery are inapplicable.Â  See, e.g., Poole \r\n  v. State, 306 S.E.2d 394 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983); People v. DeWitt, 397 \r\n  N.E.2d 1385 (Ill. 1979); People v. Mitchell, 607 N.Y.S.2d 417 (N.Y. App. \r\n  Div. 1994); State v. Gedutis, 653 A.2d 761 (Vt. 1994).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGiven our appellate courts have extended the application \r\n  of Brady and Rule 5 beyond criminal trial proceedings, we are persuaded \r\n  by those jurisdictions that have applied Brady and state criminal discovery \r\n  rules in probation revocation proceedings. As previously discussed, these disclosure \r\n  rules have been applied in sentencing proceedings and guilty plea proceedings.Â  \r\n  Thus, the fact that a probation revocation hearing is not the equivalent of \r\n  a â€œcriminal trialâ€ is not dispositive.Â  See State v. Franks, 276 \r\n  S.C. 636, 638, 281 S.E.2d 227, 228 (1981) (A â€œprobation revocation proceeding \r\n  is not a criminal trial . . . but a more informal proceeding with respect to \r\n  notice and proof of the alleged violations.â€).Â  Similar to a sentencing or guilty \r\n  plea proceeding, a probation revocation hearing involves a determination of \r\n  â€œguilt,â€ i.e., whether a probation violation has occurred, as well as \r\n  an imposition of a sentence.Â  As such, we discern no reason to restrict the \r\n  application of the due process requirements of Brady in this setting.Â  \r\n  See Huckaby v. State, 305 S.C. 331, 335 n.1, 408 S.E.2d 242, 244 \r\n  n.1 (1991) (recognizing constitutional rights are available to probationer).Â  \r\n  Moreover, even though the text of Rule 5 refers to trials, the heading of the \r\n  rule includes â€œcriminal casesâ€ and provides for disclosure of information that \r\n  is â€œmaterial to the preparationâ€ of the defense.Â  Furthermore, there is no apparent \r\n  statutory restriction placed on disclosure.Â  In fact, the statute that the circuit \r\n  court relied on in this case to restrict discovery permits the court to order \r\n  disclosure of material obtained by a probation agent.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-290 \r\n  (Supp. 2003).\r\nOur decision should not, however, be translated \r\n  into unlimited discovery for a probationer.Â  See State v. Mixon, \r\n  275 S.C. 575, 582-83, 274 S.E.2d 406, 409 (1981) (â€œBrady does not speak \r\n  in terms of creating rights to discover, but rather determined that suppression \r\n  by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates \r\n  due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment.â€).Â  \r\n  Instead, we agree with those jurisdictions that permit â€œreasonableâ€ discovery.Â  \r\n  See Bobbi J. Anello, Annotation, Availability of Discovery At Probation \r\n  Revocation Hearings, 52 A.L.R. 5th 559, 587 (1997 &amp; Supp. 2003); see, \r\n  e.g., Kanuck v. Meehan, 798 P.2d 420 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1990); Cuciak \r\n  v. State, 410 So. 2d 916 (Fla. 1982); State v. DeBorde, 915 P.2d \r\n  906 (N.M. Ct. App. 1996).Â  Although the parameters of â€œreasonableâ€ discovery \r\n  are difficult to outline, at least one jurisdiction has explained â€œ[t]he trial \r\n  court has the inherent power to decide what is reasonable discovery in a probation \r\n  revocation proceeding. . . . At the very least a probationer is entitled to \r\n  the name and identification of his accusers and other basic information that \r\n  is reasonably necessary to the preparation of his defense.â€Â  Cuciak, \r\n  410 So. 2d at 918.\r\nApplying the foregoing analysis to the instant case, we find \r\n  the trial court erred as matter of law in ruling that Brady and Rule \r\n  5 did not apply to Hillâ€™s probation revocation proceeding.Â  Moreover, we reject \r\n  the Departmentâ€™s position that it was unable to comply with these rules because \r\n  it is a separate entity from SLED and the Anderson County Solicitorâ€™s Office, \r\n  the departments that had direct access to the requested documents.Â  Even if \r\n  the information was not in the possession of the Department, Brady and \r\n  Rule 5 still required disclosure to Hill.Â  See Kennerly, 331 S.C. \r\n  at 452, 503 S.E.2d at 220 (The Brady disclosure rule â€œextends to evidence \r\n  that is not in the actual possession of the prosecution but known by others \r\n  acting on the governmentâ€™s behalf.â€); Id. at 453, 503 S.E.2d at 220 (Rule \r\n  5 â€œclearly applies to evidence within the actual possession of the prosecution \r\n  and seems to also apply to evidence within the possession of other government \r\n  agencies.â€); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-280(B) (Supp. 2003) (â€œA \r\n  probation agent has the power and authority to enforce the criminal laws of \r\n  the State.Â  In the performance of his duties of probation, parole, community \r\n  supervision, and investigation, he is regarded as the official representative \r\n  of the court, the department, and the board.â€); cf. Morrissey, \r\n  408 U.S. at 480 (â€œSupervision [in a parole case] is not directly by the court \r\n  but by an administrative agency, which is sometimes an arm of the court and \r\n  sometimes of the executive.â€).Â  \r\nFinally, the failure to disclose this evidence to Hill prior \r\n  to the revocation hearing was not harmless.Â  See Proctor, 348 \r\n  S.C. at 334-35, 559 S.E.2d at 324-25 (applying harmless error analysis to Stateâ€™s \r\n  failure to comply with Rule 5 and Brady).Â  â€œFor Brady purposes, \r\n  in determining the materiality of nondisclosed evidence, an appellate court \r\n  must consider the evidence in the context of the entire record.Â  However, the \r\n  court should not consider the sufficiency of the evidence.Â  The courtâ€™s function \r\n  is to determine whether the appellantâ€™s right to a fair trial has been impaired.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 177, 508 S.E.2d 870, 879 (1998) (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nHere, the requested documents were produced just prior to \r\n  the hearing on Hillâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  At that point in the procedure, \r\n  the circuit court had ruled on the merits of the revocation without the benefit \r\n  of all of the evidence.Â  The fact that Hill was able to use the information \r\n  at the reconsideration hearing did not remove the prejudice.Â  Having already \r\n  found Hill violated his probation and having imposed a sentence, we believe \r\n  it would have been difficult for the court to be completely objective during \r\n  the subsequent proceeding.Â  Thus, we find the information was material and the \r\n  failure to disclose it deprived Hill of a fair hearing.Â  See People \r\n  v. Mitchell, 607 N.Y.S.2d 417, 418 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994) (holding probationer \r\n  was entitled access to prior statements of hearing witnesses regarding the subject \r\n  of their testimony in order to afford him â€œa meaningful opportunity to conduct \r\n  cross-examinationâ€ at his probation revocation hearing); see also State \r\n  v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 553, 552 S.E.2d 300, 314 (2001), cert. denied, \r\n  535 U.S. 933 (2002) (â€œEvidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability \r\n  that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have \r\n  been different.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine \r\n  confidence in the outcome.â€); State v. Goodson, 276 S.C. 243, 247, 277 \r\n  S.E.2d 602, 604-05 (1981) (stating, in discussing a Brady violation, \r\n  â€œ[w]hile we are not persuaded that this evidence necessarily exculpates appellant, \r\n  we find that sufficient question has been cast upon conclusions reached in the \r\n  trial below to justify a reconsideration of the matter by a jury appraised [sic] \r\n  of these new factorsâ€).Â Â \r\nBecause the definition of â€œmaterialâ€ is the same for analysis \r\n  under Brady and Rule 5, we also find the failure to disclose the requested \r\n  documents constituted a Rule 5 violation.Â  â€œOnce a Rule 5 violation is shown, \r\n  reversal is required only where the defendant suffered prejudice from the violation.â€Â  \r\n  Proctor, 348 S.C. at 330-31, 559 S.E.2d at 322.Â  Again, we find Hill \r\n  was prejudiced by the late disclosure given he was unable to present this evidence \r\n  and thoroughly cross-examine the witnesses.Â  Accordingly, we remand for a de \r\n  novo revocation hearing.\r\nII.Â  42 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 1983\r\nHill argues the circuit court erred in offering \r\n  to reduce his sentence if he would release any claims he may have pursuant to \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  Hill asserts this suggestion came up during a discussion \r\n  between the parties.\r\nWe, however, find the issue is not preserved for our review \r\n  because the conversation is not included in the record on appeal.Â  See \r\n  York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997) \r\n  (stating objection made in off-the-record conference not placed on record does \r\n  not preserve the issue for review); see also Hundley v. Rite Aid of \r\n  South Carolina Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 306, 529 S.E.2d 45, 57 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n  (finding motions must be made on the record to be preserved for review by an \r\n  appellate court).Â  \r\nIII.Â  Rules 28 \r\n  and 29, SCRCrimP\r\nHill contends the circuit court erred by not allowing \r\n  defense counsel to proceed simultaneously under both Rules 28 and 29, SCRCrimP.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the hearing on Hillâ€™s motion \r\n  to reconsider, the court informed counsel he would have to choose between Rule \r\n  28 and Rule 29, as he could not proceed under both simultaneously.Â  Defense \r\n  counsel agreed and decided to proceed under Rule 29 for a new trial based on \r\n  after-discovered evidence.Â  Because counsel conceded this issue during the proceedings \r\n  below, it is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Benton, 338 S.C. \r\n  151, 157, 526 S.E.2d 228, 231 (2000), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1209 (2000) \r\n  (holding issue not preserved for appellate consideration where appellant conceded \r\n  the issue at trial); TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, \r\n  331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (1998) (issue conceded to the trial court \r\n  cannot be raised on appeal).Â  \r\nIV.Â  Burden of \r\n  Proof under Rule 29, SCRCrimP\r\nHill further argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  finding he did not meet the burden of proof under Rule 29(b), SCRCrimP for the \r\n  grant of a new trial.Â Â Â  \r\nThe denial of a new trial will not be reversed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. South, 310 S.C. 504, 507, 427 \r\n  S.E.2d 666, 668 (1993).Â  To prevail on a motion for a new trial based on after-discovered \r\n  evidence, it is necessary to show that the evidence:Â  â€œ(1) would probably change \r\n  the result if a new trial is had;Â  (2) has been discovered since the trial;Â  \r\n  (3) could not have been discovered before trial;Â  (4) is material to the issue \r\n  of guilt or innocence; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 507, 427 S.E.2d at 668-69.\r\nBecause we reverse and remand on Hillâ€™s issue involving \r\n  Rule 5 and Brady, we need not address this issue.Â  See Mixon, \r\n  275 S.C. at 582, 274 S.E.2d at 409 (comparing relief sought in Brady \r\n  motion to motion for new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence); \r\n  see also State v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 619, 513 S.E.2d 98, 99 \r\n  (1999) (wherein the Supreme Court, because it reversed and granted a new trial \r\n  on one issue, did not address other issues raised by appellant).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we find \r\n  the disclosure rules of Brady and Rule 5 are applicable in probation \r\n  revocation cases.Â  As such, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision denying \r\n  Hill access to this information prior to the revocation hearing and remand for \r\n  a de novo revocation hearing.Â  Finally, we affirm Hillâ€™s issues \r\n  regarding 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 and Rules 28 and 29 of the South Carolina Rules of \r\n  Criminal Procedure.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Although the judge did not reference the specific statute, he was \r\n    apparently relying on section 24-21-290, which provides:\r\n  \r\n  All information and data \r\n    obtained in the discharge of his official duty by a probation agent is privileged \r\n    information, is not receivable as evidence in a court, and may not be disclosed \r\n    directly or indirectly to anyone other than the judge or others entitled under \r\n    this chapter to receive reports unless ordered by the court or the director.\r\n  \r\n  S.C.

Ballou, of Rock Hill; John Pressly Gettys, Jr., \r\n  of Rock Hill; for Appellant.\r\nGeorge W. Speedy, of Camden; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â Â  William Settlemeyer \r\n  sued his daughter, Katherine McCluney, claiming ownership of four tracts of \r\n  land in York County (â€œthe propertiesâ€) by an express, constructive, or resulting \r\n  trust.Â  The circuit court concluded no trust existed and McCluney was the legal \r\n  and equitable owner of the properties.Â  Settlemeyer appeals, arguing the circuit \r\n  court erred by denying relief on his claim for: 1) an express trust; 2) a constructive \r\n  trust; and 3) a resulting trust.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBetween March 1982 and January 1991, \r\n  Settlemeyer purchased the properties. Â In each instance, he had the title \r\n  issued in McCluneyâ€™s name.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Settlemeyer filed a lawsuit, alleging \r\n  the properties were held in an express, constructive or resulting trust, with \r\n  McCluney as the trustee and Settlemeyer as the beneficiary.Â  \r\nAt trial, Settlemeyer testified he voluntarily placed \r\n  title of the properties in McCluneyâ€™s name, admitting McCluney had not induced \r\n  him to have the properties conveyed to her. Â Settlemeyer further testified \r\n  he believed he and McCluney had an oral agreement in which he would purchase \r\n  property and title it in McCluneyâ€™s name, with the understanding that McCluney \r\n  would later convey it to him.Â  However, when specifically asked if there was \r\n  â€œever an agreement between [Settlemeyer] and [McCluney] that she would reconvey \r\n  the property back to [Settlemeyer],â€ Settlemeyer stated, â€œIt wasnâ€™t brought \r\n  up.Â  I trusted her to think she would deed it back to me.â€Â  Additionally, Settlemeyer \r\n  admitted he denied ownership of the properties during one of his divorce proceedings \r\n  and during a Department of Health and Environmental Control investigation of \r\n  one of the properties.Â  \r\nMcCluney denied she and her father had an agreement \r\n  in which she was to convey the properties to him but confirmed she did not pay \r\n  the purchase price or property taxes for the properties.Â  McCluney stated she \r\n  believed the properties were gifts from Settlemeyer.Â  \r\nThe circuit court found the Statute of Frauds barred \r\n  finding an express trust existed.Â  Additionally, the circuit court found the \r\n  claim of a constructive trust failed because Settlemeyer did not prove McCluney \r\n  acted fraudulently in the transaction.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court found \r\n  the claim for a resulting trust failed because Settlemeyer failed to rebut the \r\n  presumption that the properties were given to McCluney as gifts.Â  \r\nSubsequently, in Settlemeyerâ€™s motion for reconsideration, \r\n  Settlemeyer argued the circuit court erred by failing to address his part-performance \r\n  argument concerning the express trust.Â  Thereafter, the circuit court denied \r\n  Settlemeyerâ€™s motion for reconsideration without addressing part performance.Â  \r\n  Settlemeyer appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, \r\n  . . . this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Stackhouse v. Cook, 271 S.C. \r\n  518, 521, 248 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1978).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Express Trust\r\nSettlemeyer argues the circuit court \r\n  erred by denying relief on his claim of an express trust.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe statute of frauds requires that a declaration \r\n  of an express trust of land must be in writing. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-101 (1987). \r\n  Â However, â€œsufficient part performance of a parol contract for the conveyance \r\n  of land will remove the contract from the statute of frauds.â€Â  Stackhouse, \r\n  271 S.C. at 521, 248 S.E.2d at 483. Â \r\nTo compel specific performance of an oral agreement \r\n  where part performance is alleged to remove the contract from the statute of \r\n  frauds, a court of equity must find: 1) clear evidence of an oral agreement; \r\n  2) the agreement had been partially executed; and 3) the party who requested \r\n  performance had completed or was willing to complete his part of the oral agreement.Â  \r\n  Gibson v. Hrysikos, 293 S.C. 8, 13-14, 358 S.E.2d 173, 176 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987).Â Â  \r\nBecause both Settlemeyer and McCluney testified no \r\n  written document existed governing conveyance of the properties between the \r\n  parties, we only address the issue of part performance.Â  \r\nAt trial, McCluney denied an oral agreement existed \r\n  between the parties in which she was to convey the properties to Settlemeyer. \r\n  Â Furthermore, although Settlemeyer testified he thought such an agreement \r\n  existed between the parties, he stated the parties did not orally express this \r\n  agreement.Â  Rather, he testified he trusted McCluney to act as he desired. \r\nBased on our review of the evidence contained in \r\n  the record, we hold Settlemeyer did not present clear evidence of an oral agreement \r\n  between the parties. See Gibson, 293 S.C. at 13, 358 S.E.2d at \r\n  176 (holding a court must find, among other things, clear evidence of the existence \r\n  of an oral agreement for part performance to remove the contract from the statute \r\n  of frauds).Â  \r\nWithout the existence of an oral agreement, Settlemeyer \r\n  cannot establish part performance of the alleged agreement.Â  See Stackhouse, \r\n  271 S.C. at 521, 248 S.E.2d at 483 (holding sufficient part performance of an \r\n  oral trust agreement is required to remove it from the statute of frauds). Â Thus, \r\n  the circuit court did not err by denying Settlemeyer relief on his claim of \r\n  an express trust. \r\nThe remaining issues are affirmed pursuant to Rule \r\n  220, SCACR and the following authorities: As to Issue II: Smith v. \r\n  South Carolina Ret. Sys., 336 S.C. 505, 529, 520 S.E.2d 339, 352 (Ct.

We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\nLinda Angus began employment with \r\n  Horry County as its county administrator and chief operating officer on June \r\n  3, 1996. Her employment contract stated that she was â€œemployed at the willâ€ \r\n  of the Horry County Council. The contract stipulated that Angus was to be given \r\n  365 days notice or 365 days severance pay in the event of a termination. On \r\n  June 22, 1999, Horry County terminated her employment. Pursuant to the terms \r\n  of the agreement, Angus was paid for 365 days and was extended the appropriate \r\n  benefits. \r\nOn January 14, 2000, Angus filed \r\n  a complaint against Burroughs &amp; Chapin Co., Doug Wendel, Pat Dowling, Myrtle \r\n  Beach Herald, Deborah Johnson, Chandler Prosser, Marvin Heyd, Chandler Brigham, \r\n  and Terry Cooper (â€œthe respondentsâ€). Wendel and Dowling were employees of Burroughs \r\n  &amp; Chapin; Johnson was an employee of the Myrtle Beach Herald; Prosser, Heyd, \r\n  Brigham, and Cooper were all Horry County Council members. Angus alleged numerous \r\n  causes of action, including tortious interference with contractual relations, \r\n  defamation, civil conspiracy, and unfair trade practices, all arising from the \r\n  termination of her employment by Horry County. Specifically, Angus alleged that \r\n  the respondents â€œconspired with numerous persons â€¦ to see that Angus was terminated \r\n  from her employment as Horry County Administrator.â€Â  And sheÂ  alleged that the \r\n  respondents did this to gain financial advantage and to avoid regulatory requirements.Â  \r\n  \r\nAfter orders dismissing the causes \r\n  of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, defamation, \r\n  and unfair trade practices, the only remaining cause of action was for civil \r\n  conspiracy.Â  In an order dated November 28, 2001, the circuit court granted \r\n  summary judgment to all Respondents as to the civil conspiracy claims.Â  Angus \r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nâ€œSummary judgment is proper where \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 345 S.C. 23, 27, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  515, 517 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Quality Towing, Inc. \r\n  v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 33, 530 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2000)).Â  \r\n  â€œSummary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to \r\n  the evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the conclusions to be drawn \r\n  from those facts.â€Â  Id. at 28, 545 S.E.2d at 517 (citing Piedmont \r\n  Engineers, Architects &amp; Planners, Inc. v. First Hartford Realty Corp., \r\n  278 S.C. 195, 196, 293 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1982)).Â  â€œIn determining whether any \r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably \r\n  drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.â€Â  Id. at 28, 545 S.E.2d at 518 (citing Bishop v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 85, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998)).Â  â€œSummary \r\n  judgment should be invoked cautiously to avoid improperly denying a party a \r\n  trial on the disputed factual issues.â€Â  Id. (citing Baughman v. Am. \r\n  Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991)).\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAngus argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting the respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment as to the claim for \r\n  civil conspiracy. We agree in part.\r\nIn South Carolina, â€œ[a] civil conspiracy \r\n  exists when there is (1) a combination of two or more persons, (2) for the purpose \r\n  of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes the plaintiff special damage.â€ Robertson \r\n  v. First Union Nat. Bank, 350 S.C. 339, 348, 565 S.E.2d 309, 314 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002) (citing Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 600, 358 \r\n  S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. 1987)). â€œA civil conspiracy may, of course, be furthered \r\n  by an unlawful act. â€¦ [but] an unlawful act is not a necessary element of the \r\n  tort. An action for conspiracy may lie even though no unlawful means are used \r\n  and no independently unlawful acts are committed.â€ Lee v. Chesterfield General \r\n  Hosp., 289 S.C. 6, 11, 344 S.E.2d 379, 382 (Ct. App. 1986). â€œA conspiracy \r\n  is actionable only if overt acts pursuant to the common design proximately cause \r\n  damage to the party bringing the action.â€Â  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, \r\n  324 S.C. 89, 100, 478 S.E.2d 45, 51 (1996) (citing Todd v. S.C. Farm Bureau \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 284, 292, 278 S.E.2d 607, 611 (1981)).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn granting summary judgment, the \r\n  trial court relied exclusively on Ross v. Life Ins. Co. of Va., 273 S.C. \r\n  764, 259 S.E.2d 814 (1979). There, plaintiff brought a wrongful termination \r\n  action against his former employer, alleging that the former employer had conspired \r\n  with others to terminate his employment. Our supreme court sustained the summary \r\n  judgment for the former employer, reasoning that an at-will employee â€œmay be \r\n  terminated at any time for any reason or no reason at all.â€ Id. at 765, \r\n  259 S.E.2d at 815. The supreme court based its decision largely on the employerâ€™s \r\n  ability to fire plaintiff at any time, for no reason or for a bad reason. \r\nRoss clearly holds that at-will \r\n  employees can be fired for any reason. Moody v. McLellan, 452, 295 S.C. \r\n  157, 162, 367 S.E.2d 449 (1988). It also holds that an at-will employee cannot \r\n  maintain an action against a former employer for civil conspiracy that resulted \r\n  in the employeeâ€™s termination. Mills v. Leath, 709 F. Supp. 671, 675 \r\n  (D.S.C. 1988). The trial court was therefore correct to dismiss the action as \r\n  to the four council members. Angus claims that she was suing them not as council \r\n  members, but in their capacity as individuals. That argument is unpersuasive. \r\n  The employment agreement stated on its face that Angus served â€œat the willâ€ \r\n  of the Council. Clearly, the council members acted within their authority when \r\n  they fired Angus and they cannot be sued for doing what they had a right to \r\n  do. See Antley v. Shepherd, 340 S.C. 541, 550, 532 S.E.2d 294, \r\n  298 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that a county official was immune from liability \r\n  in his individual capacity since that official acted within his authority in \r\n  firing an employee who was serving at the will of the official).\r\nBurroughs &amp; Chapin, Wendel, Dowling, \r\n  the Myrtle Beach Herald, and Johnson (â€œthe remaining respondentsâ€) present a \r\n  different issue than the one addressed in Ross. They are not Angusâ€™s \r\n  former employers. As to them, the appropriate inquiry is whether an at-will \r\n  employee can maintain an action for civil conspiracy against a third-party (other \r\n  than the former employer) on the theory that the third-partyâ€™s conspiracy caused \r\n  the former employer to fire the employee. We believe that an at will-employee \r\n  can maintain such an action.\r\nIn Todd v. S.C. Farm Bureau, \r\n  283 S.C. 155, 321 S.E.2d 602 (Ct. App. 1984) (overruled on other grounds), the \r\n  Court recognized that a former employee could bring an action for tortious interference \r\n  against a third party, even if the employment was at will. In that case, Farm \r\n  Bureau, the employer, had hired Equifax to investigate some irregularities. \r\n  Equifax identified Todd, an employee, as the alleged wrongdoer. Farm Bureau \r\n  then fired Todd. Todd sued Farm Bureau and Equifax. The jury found for Todd, \r\n  awarding him damages. Farm Bureau and Equifax appealed. The Court ruled that \r\n  â€œwhere a third party induces an employer to discharge an employee who is working \r\n  under a contract terminable at will, but which employment would have continued \r\n  indefinitely except for such interference, a cause of action arises in favor \r\n  of the employee against the third person,â€ if the alleged inducement â€œinfluence[d], \r\n  â€¦ or coerce[d] one of the parties to the contract to abandon the relationship \r\n  or breach the contract.â€ Id. at 163, 321 S.E.2d at 607 (citation omitted). \r\n  However, the Court found that the evidence failed to show that Equifax had participated \r\n  in a conspiracy and reversed. [1]  \r\nOther jurisdictions have adopted \r\nthe same principle. The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of an attorney \r\nwho had sued a railroad company because the railroad company had â€œinduced the \r\n[attorneyâ€™s] client, and conspired with himâ€ to fire the attorney. Studdard \r\nv. Evans, 135 S.E.2d 60, 64 (Ga. Ct. App. 1964). As a result, the attorney \r\nwas forced to withdraw from the case. The railroad company argued that the attorney \r\ndid not state a cause of action because the client was free to fire him at any \r\ntime. The court rejected the argument. The court held that â€œthe fact that employment \r\nis at the will of the employer, [does] not give immunity to a third person who, \r\nwithout justification, interferes with the relation between the parties to the \r\ncontract.â€ Id.  \r\nNorth Carolina reached a similar \r\n  conclusion in Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 221 S.E.2d 282 (N.C. 1976). There, \r\n  the court first defined an â€œoutsiderâ€ as â€œone who was not a party to the terminated \r\n  contract and who had no legitimate business interest of his own in the subject \r\n  matter thereof.â€ Smith, 221 S.E.2d at 292. Then the court explained:\r\n\r\n  The question presented to us by \r\n    this appeal is: If A, knowing B is employed by C under a contract terminable \r\n    at will by C, maliciously causes C to discharge B, which C would not otherwise \r\n    have done, can B maintain in the courts of this State an action against A \r\n    for damages? Our conclusion is that he can. \r\n\r\nId. at 290.\r\nThese facts are similar if not identical \r\n  to those alleged by Angus. If the remaining respondents maliciously caused Horry \r\n  County to discharge Angus, assuming that Angus was able to continue performing \r\n  her job well â€“ then the answer is yes, Angus can bring an action against them. \r\n   [2] Â  \r\nAs stated earlier, the trial court \r\n  in the current case relied on Ross in reaching its conclusion.Â  Ross \r\n  in turn cites Kirby v. Gulf Oil, 230 S.C. 11, 94 S.E.2d 21 (1956) as \r\n  its authority for the principle that â€œa conspiracy may not be based upon an \r\n  act done in the exercise of a legal right.â€ Ross, 273 S.C. at 765, 259 \r\n  S.E.2d at 815. Kirby cites McMaster v. Ford Motor Co., 122 S.C. \r\n  244, 115 S.E. 244 (1921) and Howle v. Mountain Ice Co., 167 S.C. 41, \r\n  165 S.E. 724 (1932). But any reliance on Ross and those cases is misplaced. \r\n  Kirby, McMaster and Howle are all easily distinguishable \r\n  from Angusâ€™s claim, for there is no third party involvement in those cases.Â  \r\n  \r\nKirby involved real estate.Â  \r\n  Kirby had a month-to-month lease on a gas station, but Kirbyâ€™s landlord, Whitlock, \r\n  terminated the lease, causing Kirby to lose the business. Kirby sued, alleging \r\n  Whitlock, Gulf Oil, and Whitlockâ€™s son conspired to take his gas station. The \r\n  supreme court sustained a dismissal in favor of the defendants, holding that \r\n  â€œa conspiracy may not be based upon an act done in the exercise of a legal right.â€ \r\n  Kirby, 230 S.C. at 27. The court found that Whitlock, Sr., had terminated \r\n  the lease for his own reasons, without any prompting from anyone. Neither Whitlockâ€™s \r\n  son nor Gulf Oil had played an active role in Kirbyâ€™s ruin.\r\nMcMaster, too, is easily distinguished \r\n  from this case. In McMaster, the issue revolved around a partyâ€™s right \r\n  to determine with whom to conduct business. McMaster sued Ford and Fordâ€™s dealers \r\n  because Ford would not use and would not allow its dealers to use McMasterâ€™s \r\n  products on Ford-manufactured automobiles. Since the dealers were Fordâ€™s agents, \r\n  no independent third party was involved. See Todd, 283 S.C. at \r\n  164, 283 S.E.2d at 607 (1984) (citing Muller v. Stromberg, 427 So.2d \r\n  266 (Fla. Dist. App. 1983) (ruling that an officer or agent of a corporation \r\n  acting for or on behalf of the corporation is not a third party)). In dismissing \r\n  the action, the McMaster court explained that â€œ[w]hile there is some \r\n  difference of opinion, the weight of authority is in favor of the general proposition \r\n  that an act done in the exercise of a legal right cannot be treated as wrongful \r\n  and actionable merely because a malicious motive prompted the exercise of the \r\n  right.â€ McMaster, 122 S.C. at 246. But that general principle protects \r\n  only a person directly involved in the underlying relationship, not a \r\n  third party. [3] Â Â  \r\nMoreover, the McMaster court \r\n  relied secondarily on the absence of an unlawful act and of an unlawful means. \r\n  The court reasoned that the allegation of conspiracy was of no import â€œin the \r\n  legal consequences, becauseâ€¦[the] defendants did nothing unlawful and resorted \r\n  to no unlawful means to accomplish their purpose.â€ Id. at 247. However, \r\n  as indicated earlier, an unlawful means and unlawful purpose are required elements \r\n  of a criminal, not civil, conspiracy. An action for civil conspiracy may exist \r\n  even though no unlawful means were used. See LaMotte v. Punch Line, \r\n  296 S.C. 66, 70, 370 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1988); Lee, 289 S.C. at 11, 344 \r\n  S.E.2d at 382.\r\nFinally, in Howle, the plaintiff \r\n  sued the defendants alleging they conspired to eliminate competition in the \r\n  ice business.Â  Even while sustaining a dismissal of the action, the supreme \r\n  court clarified its position:Â  \r\n\r\n  [A]s to conspiracy, [the principle] \r\n    that two or more may lawfully do, under agreement and regardless of purpose \r\n    or motive whatever one may lawfully do singly â€¦ is not the majority \r\n    view or that of this court.Â  We should not be understood as holding \r\n    that under no circumstances can an act resulting in damage, when done by two \r\n    or more pursuant to an agreement, be actionable if a like act, when done by \r\n    one alone, would not be actionable.Â  The decision here is based solely â€¦ upon \r\n    the insufficiency of the evidence to show an agreement between the defendants \r\n    â€¦ the gravamen of the charge.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 47, 165 S.E. at 729 \r\n  (affâ€™d on rehâ€™g) (emphasis added).\r\nIn the current case, the remaining \r\n  respondents argued, and the trial court accepted, that â€œ[s]ince Mrs. Angusâ€™ \r\n  employment was terminable at will, she has no cause of action for civil conspiracy.â€ \r\n  That conclusion is excessively broad. In Lee, the Court pointedly rejected \r\n  the notion that â€œliability for the tort of conspiracy cannot be grounded on \r\n  a lawful act.â€ 289 S.C. at 12, 344 S.E.2d at 382. \r\nThe United States Supreme Court had \r\n  reached a similar conclusion much earlier in Truax v. Raich, 36 S.Ct. \r\n  7, 9 (1915): \r\n\r\n  It is said that the bill does not \r\n    show an employment for a term, and that under an employment at will the complainant \r\n    could be discharged at any time, for any reason or for no reason, the motive \r\n    of the employer being immaterial. The conclusion, however, that is sought \r\n    to be drawn, is too broad. The fact that the employment is at the will of \r\n    the parties, respectively, does not make it one at the will of others.Â  \r\n    The employee has manifest interest in the freedom of the employer to exercise \r\n    his judgment without illegal interference or compulsion and, by the weight \r\n    of authority, the unjustified interference of third persons is actionable \r\n    although the employment is at will.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nIts ruling notwithstanding, Ross \r\n  does not control the current case. The facts as alleged here place the remaining \r\n  respondents squarely at the heart of the conspiracy. The theory of the case \r\n  is not that Horry County decided to fire Angus and conspired with the remaining \r\n  respondents to achieve that result, but rather that they decided to â€œget \r\n  rid ofâ€ Angus and induced Horry County to fire her. \r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order is AFFIRMED as to the council members and REVERSED \r\n  as to the remaining respondents.\r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In Todd v. S.C.Farm Bureau, 287 S.C. 190, \r\n    336 S.E.2d 472 (1985), the Supreme Court reversed that decision, reasoning \r\n    that the Court had replaced the juryâ€™s findings of facts with its own. Having \r\n    found â€œsome competent evidence on which the jury could return a verdict for \r\n    Toddâ€ (Equifax was the party that identified Todd as â€œleaking information,â€ \r\n    had administered a â€œvoice stressâ€ test, and was slated to conduct a polygraph), \r\n    the Supreme Court reinstated the juryâ€™s award against Equifax.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Angus had been employed for about three years \r\n    at the time and had received excellent evaluations.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Even in cases involving the former employer, South \r\n    Carolina courts and others have placed some limitations on the power to terminate \r\n    at-will employees. See e.g. Ludwick v. Minute of Carolina, \r\n    Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 225, 337 S.E.2d 213, 216 (1985) (recognizing a public \r\n    policy exception to the doctrine of at-will employment, reasoning that â€œ[w]here \r\n    the retaliatory discharge of an at-will employee constitutes violation of \r\n    a clear mandate of public policy, a cause of action in tort for wrongful discharge \r\n    arises); Bd. of County Commrs. v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 685 (1996) \r\n    (holding that the First Amendment protects independent contractors from termination \r\n    or prevention of automatic renewal of at-will government contracts in retaliation \r\n    for their exercise of freedom of speech); Haddle v. Garrison, 525 U.S. \r\n    121, 126 (1998) (holding that a fired at-will employee did suffer an â€œinjury \r\n    in his person or propertyâ€ within the meaning of Â§1985(2), reasoning that \r\n    common law had long offered a remedy for such losses).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3747","title":"RIM Associates v.

Dana Sinkler, Mark S. Sharpe, Paul E. Tinkler, and R. Bruce Wallace, all \r\n  of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nRichard S. Rosen and Daniel F. Blanchard, III, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: RIM Associates, a South Carolina \r\n  general partnership, sued John Blackwell, a partner, seeking contribution for \r\n  a partnership debt the partnership had incurred as a result of a debt owed to \r\n  Blackwell. The trial court ordered Blackwell to make a contribution. We reverse.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nJohn Blackwellâ€™s company, R.I. of North Charleston \r\n  (â€œR.I.â€), owned a Ramada Inn. In 1985, Everett Smith, Joe Edens and James Finley \r\n  (â€œthe partnersâ€) decided to purchase the hotel.Â  Blackwell agreed to sell the \r\n  hotel for 4.575 million dollars. As part of the purchase price, R.I. accepted \r\n  a note of 1.3 million dollars (â€œthe Blackwell noteâ€). Blackwell also received \r\n  a twenty-five percent partnership interest in RIM Associates (â€œRIMâ€), the partnership \r\n  formed by Blackwell and the partners â€œto invest in, own, and operateâ€ the hotel. \r\n  The partners financed the transaction by taking out a bank loan for the 3.275 \r\n  million dollar balance owed to Blackwell. The partners did not place any capital \r\n  in the transaction, but they guaranteed seventy-five percent of the Blackwell \r\n  note. \r\nRIM fell behind on its payments on the Blackwell \r\n  note and, in 1989, Blackwell and RIM renegotiated its terms. Blackwell extended \r\n  the maturity date of the Blackwell note and the partners guaranteed it one hundred \r\n  percent. The parties contemporaneously entered into an indemnification agreement \r\n  (â€œthe 1989 agreementâ€) that provided in part:\r\n\r\nThe Partners acknowledge and agree that each Partner, as \r\n  the owner of a twenty-five (25%) interest in the Partnership, is responsible \r\n  for twenty-five (25%) of the Partnership indebtedness and each Partner agrees \r\n  to indemnify and hold the others harmless from liability for such Partnerâ€™s \r\n  share of any such indebtedness . . . .\r\nEdens, Smith, and Finley have, in the Note Modification, agreed \r\n  to jointly and severally guarantee the payment of the Note in its entirety.Â  \r\n  It is agreed, however, that the indebtedness evidenced by the Note and any other \r\n  Partnership indebtedness in excess of the amounts above set forth shall remain \r\n  Partnership debts, the payment of which shall continue to be the obligation \r\n  of the Partnership, but Blackwell shall have no personal liability therefor \r\n  other than to the extent of his interest in the Partnership and Edens, Smith \r\n  and Finley shall not have the right to require contribution from Blackwell on \r\n  account of any payment which they may have to make on the Note. Any such \r\n  payment(s) shall be deemed to be a capital contribution(s) to the Partnership \r\n  by the party making the same. [1]   \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nNotwithstanding the 1989 agreement, RIM again fell \r\n  behind on its payments.Â  In 1997, Blackwell sued the partners for repayment \r\n  as guarantors of the Blackwell note. The partners brought a third party complaint \r\n  against RIM, seeking indemnification for the amounts due under the Blackwell \r\n  note. The partners then caused RIM to bring suit against Blackwell seeking contribution \r\n  from him in case RIM was required to indemnify the partners.Â  \r\nThe parties reached a settlement in April or June \r\n  of 1999 (â€œthe 1999 settlementâ€). The 1999 settlement provided in part: \r\n\r\n1)&nbsp; The guarantors would pay $2 million including principal, \r\n  interest, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs, to John and Hazel Blackwell.Â  John and \r\n  Hazel will satisfy the Note.Â  \r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the pending litigation against John\r\nand Hazel Blackwell will be dismissed with\r\nprejudice.\r\n3)&nbsp; John Blackwell will remain in the Partnership.Â  \r\n4)Â Â  The Partnership will not attempt to borrow the money \r\n  to pay John and Hazel except with the prior written approval of John Blackwell.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nFollowing the court-ordered 1999 settlement, Blackwell \r\n  moved to amend the order to include that â€œJohn Blackwell cannot be required \r\n  to respond to a capital call as a result of the settlement found by the Court.â€Â  \r\n  The judge refused, reasoning that â€œ[the] issue may have been raised by [Blackwell] \r\n  but it is a post-settlement issue and not properly before this court at this \r\n  time.â€ On July 14, Edens and Smith paid two million dollars pursuant to the \r\n  1999 settlement. Finley did not contribute any funds. \r\n  [2]   \r\nOn August 5, the trial judge ordered â€œ[t]he action \r\n  . . . ended and dismissed with prejudice as [to] all parties.â€ RIM moved to \r\n  amend the order. As a result, the trial judge rescinded that order and issued \r\n  a second order that dismissed with prejudice all causes of action â€œby and againstâ€ \r\n  Blackwell â€œasserted within the action,â€ all claims by RIM â€œin the Amended Fourth \r\n  Party Complaint,â€ and all actions by Blackwell. The trial judge also dismissed \r\n  all actions by the individual partners Eden, Smith, and Finley against RIM but \r\n  without prejudice. \r\nIn April 2000, RIM sued Blackwell. RIMâ€™s Amended \r\n  Complaint claimed breach of the partnership agreement and sought contribution \r\n  and specific performance.Â  Following a bench trial, the court found: \r\n\r\nThe Partnership did not â€œborrowâ€ the money to pay the settlement \r\n  in violation of the settlement agreement and did not receive monies from Smith \r\n  and Edens.Â  \r\nBlackwell was obligated to make a contribution to the Partnership \r\n  to fund the expenses of his own settlement.\r\nThe 1989 agreement, which expressly prohibits any such contribution, \r\n  had been rescinded by the Blackwell settlement.\r\nThe Partnership did not assert these claims in the prior litigation.\r\nThe Partnership claims were not barred by the dismissal with \r\n  prejudice.\r\nThe Partnership was entitled to recover attorneys fees and \r\n  costs.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge ruled that Blackwell had breached \r\n  his contractual and statutory obligations to make contributions under the partnership \r\n  agreement and the South Carolina Uniform Partnership Act.Â  Blackwell appeals.\r\n \r\n  ISSUES\r\nBlackwell raises eight exceptions to the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s rulings, but those exceptions can be condensed in the following six \r\n  issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in finding that the partnership was\r\n    authorized to bring this action?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in holding that Blackwell could be\r\n    required to contribute to the payment of his own \r\n  note?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in not finding that the claims of the partnership had \r\n  previously been dismissed with prejudice?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in not finding that the partnership borrowed the settlement \r\n  funds in violation of the settlement agreement and the 1989 agreement?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in allowing this action without first requiring an accounting?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to the partnership?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nRIM alleges two causes of action against Blackwell. \r\n  RIM characterizes them as â€œContributionâ€ and â€œBreach of Contract / Specific \r\n  Performance.â€ However, an appellate court is not bound by a partyâ€™s characterization \r\n  of the actions. Klippel v. Mid-Carolina Oil, Inc., 303 S.C. 127, 129, \r\n  399 S.E.2d 163, 164 (Ct. App. 1990) (citing Ariail v. Ariail, 295 S.C. \r\n  486, 491, 369 S.E.2d 146, 149 (Ct. App. 1988)). Whether an action is at law \r\n  or in equity is determined by the main purpose of the suit. Mortgage Recovery \r\n  Fund-Riverbend, Ltd. v.

The court should determine the \r\n  main purpose of an action from the body of the complaint. Carjow, LLC v. \r\n  Simmons, 349 S.C. 514, 518, 563 S.E.2d 359, 362 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing \r\n  Ins.

[3]  An action for specific performance \r\n  lies in equity. [4]  Ingram \r\n  v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 290 (2000); see \r\n  alsoÂ  Barnacle Broadcasting, Inc. v.

Â Because the action \r\n  is in equity, the appellate court â€œmay find facts in accordance with its own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidenceâ€ in reviewing such an action. Id. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIMâ€™s authority to bring this action \r\n   \r\n\r\nBlackwell argues that the trial judge erred in ruling \r\n  that RIM was authorized to bring this action against Blackwell. We disagree.\r\nThe partnership agreement states that â€œ[i]f any Partner \r\n  fails to make contributions to capital as provided for by the terms of this \r\n  Agreement, the remaining Partners who are not in default shall have the right \r\n  to seek and obtain damages from the defaulting Partner . . . .â€ Blackwell argues \r\n  that language allows only the partners, and not the partnership, to sue Blackwell \r\n  for damages and specific performance. However, the partnership agreement was \r\n  signed in 1985, at a time when partnerships could not bring an action in their \r\n  own name. See Haddock Flying Serv. v. Tisdale, 288 S.C. 62, 64, \r\n  339 S.E.2d 525,Â Â  526 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œHowever, a partnership is not such a \r\n  legal entity that it may maintain a suit in its name alone.â€).Â  Had the partnership \r\n  agreement stated otherwise, any such authority would have been meaningless. \r\n  The legislature remedied the situation in 1986 by adopting S.C. Ann. Code Â§ \r\n  15-5-45 (2003) which states that â€œ[a]ny partnership formed under the laws of \r\n  this State . . . shall have the capacity . . . to sue and be sued in the courts \r\n  and agencies of this State as a separate entity . . . .â€Â  \r\nMoreover, while the partnership agreement did not \r\n  authorize the partnership to sue a defaulting partner, neither did it forbid \r\n  such an action. The partnership agreement is silent on the matter. In such a \r\n  situation, we look to state law to determine whether the action is permissible. \r\n  See Weeks v. McWilliams, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289, 292 \r\n  (1987) (ruling that the dissolution of a partnership was permissible because \r\n  the partnership agreement did not specifically forbid it). The state of South \r\n  Carolina granted partnerships the power to sue on their own behalf in 1986. \r\n  Therefore, RIM can bring this action.\r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe partiesâ€™ agreements  \r\n   \r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled that the 1989 agreement was \r\n  inoperative and ordered Blackwell to contribute to RIM in order to repay Edens \r\n  and Smith for their payment of the Blackwell note. That ruling was error.\r\nIn reaching its conclusion, the trial court relied \r\n  partially on the South Carolina Uniform Partnership Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-510 \r\n  (1994). The Act states in pertinent part: â€œThe partnership must indemnify every \r\n  partner in respect of payments made and personal liabilities reasonably incurred \r\n  by him in the ordinary and proper conduct of its business or for the preservation \r\n  of its business or property.â€ Â§ 33-41-510(2). But that very section subordinates \r\n  that general principle to the partiesâ€™ agreements, explaining that the â€œrights \r\n  and duties of the partners in relation to the partnership shall be determined, \r\n  subject to any agreement between them, by the following rules . . . .â€ \r\n  Â§ 33-41-510 (emphasis added). The question then becomes what agreements existed \r\n  among Blackwell, the partners, and RIM and what effect those agreements had \r\n  on the issue of contributing additional capital.Â  The record indicates that \r\n  the partners had a partnership agreement, an Amended and Restated Indemnification \r\n  Agreement (the 1989 agreement), and the 1999 settlement. [5]  The trial judge found that the \r\n  partiesâ€™ 1999 settlement rescinded the 1989 agreement. There is no evidence \r\n  to support that conclusion. \r\nAny modification of a written contract must satisfy \r\n  all the requirements of a contract, including a meeting of the minds. First \r\n  Union Mortgage Corp. v. Thomas, 317 S.C. 63, 70, 451 S.E.2d 907, 912 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994). Here, there is no evidence of any discussion, action, or agreement \r\n  to rescind the 1989 agreement by implication or otherwise. [6] Â  There can be no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ if the issue was not \r\n  a part of the partiesâ€™ agreement. Just as importantly, the July 1999 Order specifically \r\n  states that â€œ[t]he Amended and Restated indemnification Agreement dated 1 February, \r\n  1989 was not addressed in the settlement agreement reached by the parties and \r\n  therefore it is not part of the settlement.â€ \r\nMoreover, there is no evidence that the 1989 agreement \r\n  and the 1999 settlement materially contradict each other. Both documents provide \r\n  that Blackwell would remain a partner and share in the partnershipâ€™s profits \r\n  and debts, including the Blackwell note. And both documents placed restrictions \r\n  on how the Blackwell note could be paid. The 1989 agreement stated: â€œEden, Finley, \r\n  and Smith shall not have the right to require contribution from Blackwell on \r\n  account of any payment they may have to make on the Note. Any such payment(s) \r\n  shall be deemed to be a capital contribution(s) to the Partnership by the party \r\n  making the same.â€ The 1999 settlement, too, forbade RIM to borrow money to pay \r\n  the Blackwell note without Blackwellâ€™s prior permission. Although Blackwell \r\n  may be required to contribute to the payment of the note, the documents, when \r\n  read together, limit Blackwellâ€™s contribution toward the Blackwell note to his \r\n  share of the funds generated by RIM and only if RIM did not default on the note. \r\n\r\nThis conclusion is reinforced by RIMâ€™s pleading \r\n  in the prior action. Paragraphs 37 and 39 of RIMâ€™s Amended Third Party Answer \r\n  And Claims state that RIM relied on Blackwellâ€™s representation that the â€œ[s]o-calledÂ  \r\n  [Blackwell note] would be a â€˜cash flow,â€™ â€˜softâ€™ note and would be paid from \r\n  distributions from operations and refinancing of the hotel.â€ \r\n  [7]  It is clear that the parties never agreed that Blackwell would make \r\n  a capital call contribution to pay the Blackwell note. \r\n\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEffect of prior rulings  \r\n Â Â \r\n\r\nBlackwell raises a res judicata argument, asserting \r\n  that the trial court erred when it held that its November 2, 1999 Order did \r\n  not bar RIMâ€™s current action seeking contribution from Blackwell. We agree.Â Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œA case that is dismissed â€˜with prejudiceâ€™ indicates \r\n  an adjudication on the merits and, pursuant to res judicata, prohibits subsequent \r\n  litigation to the same extent as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.â€ \r\n  Nelson v. QHG of S.C., Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 311, 580 S.E.2d 171, 182 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003). â€œTo establish res judicata, the defendant must prove the following \r\n  three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; \r\n  and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.â€ Plum Creek Dev. Co. \r\n  v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999). Res judicata \r\n  is an affirmative defense that must be pled at trial in order to be pursued \r\n  on appeal. Wagner v. Wagner, 286 S.C. 489, 491, 335 S.E.2d 246, 247 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985). An affirmative defense is waived if not pled. Howard v. S. C. \r\n  Depâ€™t of Highways, 343 S.C. 149, 152, 538 S.E.2d 291, 294 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\n  Generally, claims or defenses not presented in the pleadings will not be considered \r\n  on appeal. McNeely v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 259 S.C. 39, 41, \r\n  190 S.E.2d 499, 499 (1972).\r\nOn appeal, RIM insists that a res judicata defense \r\n  is not available to Blackwell because Blackwell did not raise it in his answer. \r\n  Blackwell counters that the res judicata issue is preserved because RIM did \r\n  not object when Blackwell argued the issue before the trial court and because \r\n  the trial court ruled on the matter in its appealed order. Generally, â€œres judicata \r\n  must be pleaded to be established,â€ but an exception to the broad rule exists \r\n  â€œwhere the matter â€˜becomes an issue without objection based upon the lack of \r\n  pleading.â€™â€ Baty v. Stanley, 291 S.C. 546, 548, 354 S.E.2d 571, 572 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1987) (citing Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 367, 315 S.E.2d 186, 188 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1984)). Therefore, RIM waived any valid objection it might have otherwise \r\n  had by not timely objecting to Blackwellâ€™s res judicata argument. \r\nWe agree that the issue was preserved and we hold \r\n  that the 1999 settlement does preclude the current claim. â€œRes judicata \r\n  bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the \r\n  same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between \r\n  those parties.â€ Plum Creek Dev. Co., 334 S.C. at 34, 512 S.E.2d at 109. \r\n  The doctrine bars not only the claims that were actually raised, but also those \r\n  â€œissues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€ Id. \r\n  (citation omitted) (emphasis added). \r\nThe 1999 settlement stipulated that â€œ[a]ll of the \r\n  pending litigation against John and Hazel Blackwell will be dismissed with prejudice.â€ \r\n  And in an amended order, the trial court dismissed with prejudice â€œall causes \r\n  of action and claims by and againstâ€ Blackwell that were â€œassertedâ€ as well \r\n  as â€œall claims made by RIMâ€ in the Amended Fourth Party Complaint. At the time, \r\n  RIM had numerous claims against Blackwell, including one for â€œEstoppel/Breach \r\n  of Partnership Agreement.â€ RIM sought indemnification as a remedy. In its 2001 \r\n  action against Blackwell, RIM again claimed â€œBreach of Partnership Agreement,â€ \r\n  but attempted to add a claim for contribution. The question then is whether \r\n  this claim is a new and separate one, as to be beyond the reach of the 1999 \r\n  documents. \r\nRIM asserts that the contribution claim is permissible \r\n  because it had not accrued and was not yet â€œassertedâ€ in 1999. Since we find \r\n  that RIM did not plead a cause of action for contribution, its argument may \r\n  well be moot. However, we choose to address it and hold that the claim is barred \r\n  by res judicata. It is well settled that â€œ[r]es judicata bars subsequent actions \r\n  by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or \r\n  occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between these parties.â€ \r\n  Nelson, 354 S.C. at 304, 580 S.E.2d at 178 (emphasis added). The source \r\n  was the same in RIMâ€™s prior action as in the action sub judice: the payment \r\n  of the Blackwell note. Therefore, RIMâ€™s current action is barred. Â \r\nRIM also contends that res judicata does not apply \r\n  because the earlier action was one for indemnification, not contribution. But \r\n  RIM is merely seeking a different remedy here. â€œA different remedy, however, \r\n  does not alter the fact that the claims are identical.â€ Plum Creek Dev. Co., \r\n  334 S.C. at 35, 512 S.E.2d at 109 (citing 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments Â§ \r\n  536 (1994) (â€œA claim for damages is a claim for relief rather than an assertion \r\n  of a different cause of action for purposes of determining the applicability \r\n  of res judicata.â€)). â€œ[F]or purposes of res judicata, â€˜cause of actionâ€™ is not \r\n  the form of action in which a claim is asserted but, rather the â€˜cause for action, \r\n  meaning the underlying facts combined with the law giving the party a right \r\n  to a remedy of one form or another based thereon.â€™â€ Id. at 36, 512 S.E.2d \r\n  at 110 (citing 50 C.J.S. Judgment Â§ 749 (1997)). [8]  As stated earlier, the genesis of this action \r\n  and of the previous one is the collection of the Blackwell note. Additionally, \r\n  the parties involved are the same. Therefore, res judicata is applicable and \r\n  bars this action.\r\n\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRIMâ€™s borrowing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n\r\nBlackwell argues the trial court erred when it found that RIM did not borrow \r\n  the funds to pay the Blackwell note in violation of the 1999 settlement. We \r\n  agree. [9] \r\nThe 1999 settlement included a stipulation that \r\n  RIM would not attempt to borrow money to pay the Blackwell note, â€œexcept with \r\n  the prior written approval of John Blackwell.â€ Aware of that condition, RIM \r\n  asked its accountant, Marty Ouzts, to treat the two million dollars from Edens \r\n  and Smith as an â€œadvance.â€ But an advance is nothing more than a loan. See \r\n  Tuller v. Nantala Park Co., 276 S.C. 667, 281 S.E.2d 474 (1981) (treating \r\n  advances as money given as part of a loan); Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern \r\n  Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 336, 577 S.E.2d 468, 473 (Ct. App. 2003) \r\n  (finding that a company was entitled to repayment even though the money it gave \r\n  was identified as an advance). As Outzts himself admitted, â€œan advance is something \r\n  that is anticipated to be repaid.â€ Smith, one of the partners, repeated as much \r\n  during his testimony. He was asked: â€œIn your terminology, does a loan and an \r\n  advance mean two different things, or is it the same thing?â€ Smith responded: \r\n  â€œI donâ€™t know of any difference.â€ In this instance, RIM entered the money received \r\n  from Smith and Edens as an advance, and that advance â€“ used to pay the Blackwell \r\n  note â€“ entitled Smith and Edens to immediate repayment.Â  Clearly, to the extent \r\n  that RIM â€œpaidâ€ the debt, it borrowed the money from Smith and Edens. Under \r\n  the 1999 settlement, RIM was not allowed to do so since Blackwell had not agreed \r\n  to the loan in writing. [10]  \r\n  Therefore, RIMâ€™s action for contribution is barred.\r\nRIM argues that the payment was made directly to \r\n  Blackwell by the partners as guarantors of the note. Thus, it was not a loan \r\n  to RIM. [11]  If this were true, then RIM would have had \r\n  no need to record the money given to Blackwell in its books as an advance from \r\n  the partners. RIMâ€™s argument convinces the Court that the surviving guarantors \r\n  of the Blackwell note were cognizant of the restrictions in the 1989 agreement \r\n  and in the 1999 settlement and attempted to circumvent those restrictions. The \r\n  only reasonable conclusion from looking at the evidence is that RIM borrowed \r\n  the money to pay the Blackwell note in violation of the 1999 settlement. \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s finding that the partnership \r\n  agreement authorized capital calls is unavailing to RIM. The 1989 agreement \r\n  exempted Blackwell from contributing to the partners for any payment made on \r\n  the Blackwell note. See supra. The 1989 agreement also required \r\n  that such payment be considered a capital contribution. Since the partnership \r\n  agreement prohibited the partners from withdrawing their capital contributions, \r\n  any payment on the Blackwell note would be payable only upon the dissolution \r\n  of the partnership. Therefore, RIM had no immediate debt to the partners, and \r\n  Blackwell had no duty to make a contribution. \r\n \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\nWe find that (1) RIM had the authority to bring \r\n  the current action; (2) the 1999 settlement did not rescind the 1989 agreement, \r\n  andÂ  Blackwell had no duty to contribute under that agreement; (3) the 1999 \r\n  litigation precludes the current action pursuant to res judicata; and (4) to \r\n  the extent that RIM paid the Blackwell note, RIM borrowed the money, clearly \r\n  violating the partiesâ€™ agreements. Having so found, we need not reach Blackwellâ€™s \r\n  remaining arguments. The trial judgeâ€™s ruling is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The Partnership Agreement prohibited the withdrawal of capital contributions. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Jim Finley has died; RIM is now suing his estate. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The reference in RIMâ€™s complaint to a cause of action for contribution \r\n    is a misnomer.Â  RIM merely alleges that Blackwell breached the partnership \r\n    agreement since that agreement provided for capital calls and Blackwell refused \r\n    to contribute when requested.Â  RIMâ€™s complaint does not reflect any allegation \r\n    that RIM had paid the partnership debt. An action for contribution cannot \r\n    be maintained prior to the payment of a debt. First Gen. Serv. of Charleston, \r\n    Inc. v. Miller, 314 S.C. 439, 443, 445 S.E.2d 446, 448 (1994) (affirming \r\n    the dismissal of an action for contribution where the plaintiff had not made \r\n    any payment since â€œthe right to contribution does not arise prior to paymentâ€); \r\n    Andrade v. Johnson, 345 S.C. 216, 225, 546 S.E.2d 665, 670 (Ct. App. \r\n    2001) (defining contribution as â€œthe â€˜[r]ight of one who has discharged a \r\n    common liability to recover of another also liable, the aliquot portion which \r\n    he ought to pay or bearâ€™â€), revâ€™d on other grounds, Andrade v. Johnson, \r\n    356 S.C. 238, 588 S.E.2d 588 (2003); 18 Am. Jur. 2d Contribution Â§ \r\n    19 (2004) (explaining that a party seeking contribution is entitled to recover \r\n    â€œthe amount he has paid in excess of his share â€¦ a ratable sum of the loss \r\n    actually sustainedâ€). Therefore, the right of contribution rises only after \r\n    a party â€œhas been compelled to pay what another should have paid.â€ 18 Am. \r\n    Jur. 2d Contribution Â§ 2 (2004). Here, since RIM does not allege in \r\n    its complaint that it paid the Blackwell note, it is doubtful that RIM can \r\n    sustain an action for contribution. Even if RIMâ€™s cause of action for contribution \r\n    was feasible, the standard of review would be the same since an action for \r\n    contribution lies in equity. See Few v. Few, 239 S.C. 321, 334, \r\n    122 S.E.2d 829, 835 (1961) (noting that â€œthe right to contribution is ordinarily \r\n    enforced in equityâ€); Kafka v. Pope, 521 N.W.2d 174, 176 (Wis. Ct. \r\n    App. 1994) (explaining that the contribution process â€œis based on principles \r\n    of equity . . . â€). Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  RIM alleges the lack of an adequate remedy at \r\n    law. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The partners contend that the parties reached a settlement on April \r\n    9, as per a letter from Blackwell to the partners. Blackwell disputed the \r\n    settlement, but the trial judge found in his June 11 Order that the parties \r\n    had reached a settlement â€œaccording to the terms of the March 31st \r\n    letter.â€ Contrary to RIMâ€™s assertion, however, the March 31 letter does not \r\n    represent the complete settlement between the parties. In response to a motion \r\n    to reconsider the June 11 Order, the trial court ruled in its July 1, 1999 \r\n    Order that certain items not included in that letter are â€œthe \r\n    basis for the settlement.â€ Moreover, the trial court indicated that the April \r\n    9, 1999 letter mentioned at least one term not contained in the March 31 letter, \r\n    which term is also a condition of the settlement. We therefore must glean \r\n    the complete terms of the 1999 settlement from more than one document. The \r\n    parties are appealing neither the June 11 nor the July 11 Orders.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] The parties had expressly invalidated â€œin its entiretyâ€ their 1985 \r\n    Indemnification Agreement, replacing it with the 1989 agreement. Had they \r\n    wished to invalidate the 1989 agreement, they certainly could have included \r\n    similar language in the 1999 settlement.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  When the hotel was refinanced, RIM retained the \r\n    excess proceeds and did not pay the Blackwell note.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8] RIM could also have brought an action for exoneration whereby it could \r\n    have sought payment from Blackwell even before satisfying the Blackwell note. \r\n    See 38 Am. Jur. 2d Guaranty Â§ 124 (1994).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  The Court understands that the debt was indeed paid. We maintain \r\n    only that RIM never alleged in its complaint that it had paid the debt. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [10]  In the order now on appeal, the trial court declared that Blackwell \r\n    had given his â€œprior written approvalâ€ to a loan â€œby virtue of the settlement \r\n    that was reached . . . and confirmed in writingâ€ by the parties. Again, the \r\n    record does not provide a scintilla of evidence for such a conclusion. Reaching \r\n    a settlement is a far cry from agreeing that a debt can be repaid with a loan.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [11]  We note that this argument supports the notion that RIM cannot bring \r\n    a cause of action for contribution since RIM was not the party that paid the \r\n    debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3797","title":"Gaddy v.

Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  \r\n  â€œ[A]n action to set aside a power of attorney and an instrument revoking a power \r\n  of attorney on the ground of a lack of mental capacity sounds in equity.â€Â  In \r\n  re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We thus \r\n  utilize an equity standard of review.Â  As such, this court has jurisdiction \r\n  to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  â€œHowever, \r\n  this broad scope of review does not require an appellate court to disregard \r\n  the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better \r\n  position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  Id.Â Â  Additionally, \r\n  Appellants carry the burden of proving that the trial court made erroneous findings.Â  \r\n  Id., 344 S.C. at 387, 544 S.E.2d at 623-24.\r\nFACTS\r\nMs. M was born in 1918 and grew up in Fairfield \r\n  County.Â  She moved to Greenville, where she majored in sociology at Furman University \r\n  and later worked for the South Carolina Department of Social Services.Â  After \r\n  retiring, Ms. M returned to Fairfield where she lived on her family farm with \r\n  her brother, a dentist, until his death in the early 1980s.Â  Ms. M never married.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Gaddy was Ms. Mâ€™s physician and a close family \r\n  friend. [2] Â  Ms. M and Dr. Gaddyâ€™s family \r\n  lived on nearby farms and visited each other frequently throughout the 1980s \r\n  and 1990s.Â Â  For many years Ms. M spent holidays and birthdays with the Gaddy \r\n  family rather than her own family.Â  She also attended the Gaddy family reunions \r\n  and visited Dr. Gaddyâ€™s family in Aiken.Â Â  Eventually, Ms. M grew to refer to \r\n  Dr. Gaddy as her â€œsonâ€ and his children as her â€œgrandchildren.â€\r\nConversely, Ms. M had little contact with many \r\n  of her relatives, including Appellants. \r\nIn 1988, Ms. M asked Dr. Gaddy to accompany \r\n  her to a meeting with Albert C. Todd, III, her estate-planning attorney. [3] Â  After Ms. M met privately with Todd, Dr. Gaddy \r\n  was called into Toddâ€™s office, at which point Todd informed Dr. Gaddy that Ms. \r\n  M desired for Dr. Gaddy to handle her affairs.Â  Dr. Gaddy consented.Â  Ms. M \r\n  then executed a durable general power of attorney (1988 durable power of attorney) \r\n  designating Dr. Gaddy as her attorney-in-fact.Â  She also executed a will (1988 \r\n  Will) leaving Dr. Gaddy her personal property and farm, and appointing him as \r\n  trustee of a revocable trust she created to provide scholarships to the Medical \r\n  University of South Carolina.\r\nDr. Gaddy did not immediately record the 1988 durable \r\n  power of attorney, and Ms. M continued to manage her affairs.Â  However, by 1994, \r\n  Ms. M began showing signs of dementia.Â  For example, she became forgetful, locked \r\n  herself out of her home, and neglected her personal hygiene.Â  She eventually \r\n  stopped cooking and cleaning for herself.Â  Concerns about Ms. Mâ€™s progressively \r\n  worsening mental condition prompted Dr. Gaddy to file the 1988 durable power \r\n  of attorney in November 1995.Â  Pursuant to the 1988 durable power of attorney, \r\n  Dr. Gaddy began to act as Ms. Mâ€™s attorney-in-fact and assumed control of her \r\n  finances, farm, and health care.Â  His responsibilities included paying her bills, \r\n  tilling her garden, repairing fences, and hiring caregivers.\r\nIn March 1996, Dr. Gaddy discovered Ms. M had fallen \r\n  in her home and fractured a vertebra.Â  Ms. M was hospitalized for six weeks.Â  \r\n  During the hospitalization, Dr. Gaddy fumigated and cleaned her home, which \r\n  had become flea-infested and unclean to the point where rat droppings were found \r\n  in the house.Â  Finding that Ms. M was not mentally competent to care for herself, \r\n  he arranged for full-time caretakers to attend to her after she recovered from \r\n  the injuries she sustained in her fall.Â  He made improvements in her home, including \r\n  replacing moth-eaten area rugs with new rugs and upgraded her kitchen to enable \r\n  caretakers to prepare her meals.Â  Dr. Gaddy also made plumbing repairs to the \r\n  house, and took steps to adapt a bathroom to make it safer for caretakers to \r\n  bathe Ms. M, who was incapable of doing so unassisted.Â  During Ms. Mâ€™s hospitalization, \r\n  neither of the Appellants visited her in the hospital or sought to assist her \r\n  in any manner.\r\nDr. Gaddy had Ms. M examined and evaluated by Dr. \r\n  James E. Carnes, a neurologist, in December 1996.Â  After examining Ms. M, Dr. \r\n  Carnes found that she suffered from dementia and confirmed she was unable to \r\n  handle her affairs. \r\nAs Ms. Mâ€™s Alzheimerâ€™s disease progressed and her \r\n  faculties deteriorated, Dr. Gaddy managed her financial affairs, oversaw maintenance \r\n  of her properties, and ensured that she received constant care including food, \r\n  clothing, bathing, and housekeeping.Â  He also constructed a metal barn for multiple \r\n  purposes, including the storing of Ms. Mâ€™s personal property and farm equipment \r\n  used to maintain the 200-acre farm.Â  The barn also included small living accommodations \r\n  that Dr. Gaddy planned to use to house a caretaker or someone to maintain the \r\n  farm.Â  \r\nMs. Mâ€™s long-standing distant relationship with \r\n  some members of her family, including Appellants, changed in March of 1999. \r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1999, Appellants visited \r\n  Ms. M, and with the help of disgruntled caretaker Lil Heller, took her to an \r\n  appointment with Columbia attorney Douglas N. Trulsow to â€œget rid of Dr. Gaddy.â€ [4] Â  On the drive to Truslowâ€™s office, \r\n  Heller had to remind Ms. M several times of their destination and purpose.Â  \r\n  At Truslowâ€™s office, Ms. M signed a document revoking the 1988 Will and the \r\n  1988 durable power of attorney.Â  She also signed a new durable power of attorney \r\n  (1999 durable power of attorney) naming Appellants as her attorneys-in-fact.Â  \r\n  Appellants failed to disclose Ms. Mâ€™s dementia to Truslow. [5] Â  David Byrd, a witness to the \r\n  execution of the March 12 documents, was likewise not informed of Ms. Mâ€™s dementia.Â  \r\n\r\nArmed with the revocation of the 1988 power of \r\n  attorney and recently executed power of attorney in their favor, Appellants \r\n  prohibited Dr. Gaddy from contacting Ms. M.Â  Dr. Gaddy was even threatened with \r\n  arrest if he tried to visit Ms. M.\r\nOn March 15, 1999, three days after Ms. M purportedly \r\n  revoked the 1988 documents and executed the 1999 durable power of attorney, \r\n  Dr. Gaddy initiated the present action as her attorney-in-fact pursuant to the \r\n  1988 durable power of attorney.Â  He alleged, among other things, that the purported \r\n  revocation of the 1988 durable power of attorney and the execution of the 1999 \r\n  durable power of attorney were invalid because â€œon March 12, 1999, the date \r\n  on which Ms. M purportedly signed the 1999 power of attorney and the revocation, \r\n  she was not mentally competentâ€ due to â€œsenile dementia of the Alzheimerâ€™s type.â€Â  \r\n  The action sought declaratory judgment to render the 1999 durable power of attorney \r\n  invalid and declare the 1988 durable power of attorney valid.\r\nThe case proceeded to trial on February 19, 2001.Â  \r\n  By order of the Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court, and with \r\n  the consent of the parties, Judge Thomas L. Hughston, Jr. was appointed to preside \r\n  over the case. [6] Â  Judge Hughston \r\n  conducted a four-day bench trial.Â  During the trial, substantial medical and \r\n  lay evidence was presented regarding Ms. Mâ€™s progressively degenerative mental \r\n  state.Â Â Â  \r\nMedical testimony was presented from five physicians \r\n  who had examined Ms. M.Â  One was Dr. Carnes, who examined Ms. M on three occasions \r\n  from December 1996 through September 2000.Â  Dr. Carnes, a neurologist and expert \r\n  in the field of dementia, had treated â€œthousandsâ€ of Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients \r\n  over a fifteen-year period. \r\nDr. Carnes first conducted a neurological exam of Ms. \r\n  M in December 1996, when she was accompanied by one of her long-time caretakers, \r\n  Rosemary Wade.Â  During the examination, Ms. M could not answer simple questions \r\n  such as naming the President of the United States or recalling the year or month.Â  \r\n  Dr. Carnes said he administered a typical memory test in which he showed her \r\n  three objects and named the objects, and then a very short time later asked \r\n  her to name the objects. Ms. M was unable to name the objects.Â  Ms. M also had \r\n  difficulty with tests designed to assess memory, language function, and â€œintellectual \r\n  performance.â€Â  Based on this first examination, Dr. Carnes determined Ms. M \r\n  had moderate â€œsenile dementia of the Alzheimerâ€™s typeâ€ and was â€œnot capable \r\n  of handling financial affairs.â€  [7] Â Â  He concluded that she was not \r\n  able to make rational decisions or exercise proper judgment. \r\nDr. Carnesâ€™ second examination of Ms. M occurred on \r\n  March 19, 1999, seven days after Ms. M executed documents revoking her 1988 \r\n  Will and 1988 durable power of attorney, and executed the 1999 durable power \r\n  of attorney.Â  She was accompanied by Wade and her minister.Â  Dr. Carnes found \r\n  Ms. M â€œpleasantâ€ but â€œdisoriented.â€Â  When asked to identify the month and year, \r\n  she would not answer.Â  Dr. Carnes asked Ms. M to â€œjust name any President,â€ \r\n  and she was unable to do so.Â  She was also unable to recall three simple objects \r\n  shown to her by Dr. Carnes, and was not able to reproduce simple line drawings.Â  \r\n  The balance of the examination produced similarly revealing results, leading \r\n  Dr. Carnes to conclude that Ms. Mâ€™s level of dementia was â€œmoderate to severeâ€ \r\n  or in the â€œlater stages of moderate.â€Â  Dr. Carnes further opined that Ms. M \r\n  would not have been able to understand the nature and effects of her acts, make \r\n  rational decisions, or exercise proper judgment.Â  He added that she would not \r\n  have been able to know the extent of her estate, exercise proper judgment regarding \r\n  the distribution of her estate, or have been able to understand the execution \r\n  and meaning of legal documents.\r\nDr. Carnes examined \r\n  Ms. M a third time in September 2000.Â  She was accompanied by Lil Heller, the \r\n  caretaker who accompanied Ms. M to attorney Truslowâ€™s office, and Lynn Douglass, \r\n  a third cousin of Ms. Mâ€™s.Â  During this examination, Ms. M did not know the \r\n  month or year.Â  According to Dr. Carnes, she was unable to determine whether \r\n  the time of day was morning, afternoon, or evening.Â  Ms. M told him that she \r\n  was taking no medications, although she was taking a variety of prescription \r\n  medicine on a daily basis.Â  She also told Dr. Carnes that she lived alone, cared \r\n  for herself, and cooked for herself.Â  However, she had received full-time care \r\n  for several years.\r\nBased on Dr. Carnesâ€™s third examination \r\n  of Ms. M, he concluded that she was severely demented although physically normal \r\n  for a person her age.Â  Dr. Carnes noted that Ms. M had â€œsenile dementia of the \r\n  Alzheimerâ€™s type â€¦ that had progressed beyond the point when [he] saw her previously \r\n  and that she had â€¦ clearly shown progression of this disease â€¦.â€Â  Dr. Carnes \r\n  added that she was â€œunable to handle her financial affairsâ€ and â€œwould need \r\n  help managing her daily activities â€¦.â€\r\nWhen asked whether Ms. M may \r\n  have had a â€œlucid momentâ€ in her stage of dementia, Dr. Carnes responded, â€œNo \r\n  â€¦ [a] lucid moment is â€¦ a term that doesnâ€™t fit well with â€¦ Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.â€Â  \r\n  He then distinguished a psychiatric disease from Alzheimerâ€™s disease, noting \r\n  the former involves treatable chemical defects while the latter involves the \r\n  â€œprogressive death of brain cells.â€Â  Dr. Carnes further observed that dementia \r\n  results in a â€œfaulty rational processâ€ or an â€œintellectual process that is impaired.â€Â  \r\n  He stated that dementia sufferers do not â€œfully understand the nature of what \r\n  they [are] doing and they [do] not fully understand the ramifications of what \r\n  [is] there.â€\r\nA second neurologist, Dr. Robert R. Taylor, Jr., also \r\n  examined Ms. M on March 19, 1999, the same day that Dr. Carnes examined her \r\n  for the second time.Â  Dr. Taylor practiced neurology from 1967 until his retirement \r\n  in 2000, during which time he treated â€œthousandsâ€ of Alzheimerâ€™s patients.Â  \r\n  He described Alzheimerâ€™s disease as a cerebral degenerative disease that is \r\n  organic, rather than chemical, in nature.Â  He added that the Alzheimerâ€™s is \r\n  a â€œprimaryâ€ disease, resulting in the destruction of brain cells.Â  As the brain \r\n  disease progresses, according to Dr. Taylor, patients have increased memory \r\n  problems until they are â€œunable to perform the daily activities of living adequately \r\n  and have to have caregivers.â€\r\nDr. Taylor tested six components of Ms. Mâ€™s mental \r\n  faculties, including intellect, attention span, affect, and memory, â€œespecially \r\n  recent memory.â€Â  He noted that her memory and intellect were â€œmarkedly impairedâ€ \r\n  and that her â€œjudgment did not appear adequate â€¦.â€Â  For example, she â€œdidnâ€™t \r\n  recall what she had for breakfast or supper,â€ nor did she know the month, year, \r\n  or day of the week.\r\nÂ Dr. Taylor concluded that Ms. M was â€œvery dementedâ€ \r\n  and that her level of dementia from Alzheimerâ€™s disease was â€œsevereâ€ and in \r\n  â€œadvanced stages.â€Â  In Dr. Taylorâ€™s judgment, Ms. M â€œwas mentally incompetent \r\n  to manage any of her business affairs or manage her daily activities of livingâ€ \r\n  such as â€œdressing appropriatelyâ€ and â€œprepar[ing] food adequately.â€Â  In such \r\n  a condition, Dr. Taylor opined that Ms. M was susceptible to influence of others \r\n  and unable to â€œmake rational decisions or exercise reasonable judgment about \r\n  legal matters or any kind of business matter.â€Â  He additionally noted that Ms. \r\n  M would be unable â€œto understand the execution and meaning of legal documents, \r\n  such as [a] power of attorney and wills or revocations of those.â€Â  Dr. Taylor \r\n  found that Ms. M had been in such a condition â€œcertainly for several yearsâ€ \r\n  before his March 1999 meeting with her.Â  Dr. Taylor finally determined, consistent \r\n  with the view expressed by Dr. Carnes, that Ms. M would not â€œever have moments \r\n  of lucidityâ€ to â€œunderstand legal documents â€¦.â€\r\nAdditional expert testimony was provided by a third \r\n  neurologist, Dr. Charles B. McClure, who was selected by the parties to conduct \r\n  an independent medical evaluation of Ms. M.Â  Board certified in neurology and \r\n  psychiatry, Dr. McClure estimated he had examined â€œaround a thousandâ€ Alzheimerâ€™s \r\n  patients during the preceding twenty years in his practice.\r\nPrior to examining Ms. M, Dr. McClure thoroughly reviewed \r\n  her medical records, including notes from Drs. Carnes and Taylor.Â  He performed \r\n  a neurological evaluation on September 26, 2000.Â  During his examination, he \r\n  performed a â€œmental status examâ€ that indicated Ms. M was â€œperfectly awake and \r\n  alert.â€Â  Ms. M, however, did not know the Presidentâ€™s name or the year, and \r\n  that she â€œcould not repeat three objects immediately after [Dr. McClure] gave \r\n  her the objects.â€Â  Based on this information and other aspects of the examination, \r\n  Dr. McClure assessed that Ms. M â€œhad a substantial dementiaâ€ and that â€œher dementia \r\n  dated back to at least 1996.â€Â  When asked if he would classify her impairment \r\n  as â€œmoderate,â€ Dr. McClure responded, â€œNo, I think she had significant cortical \r\n  impairment.â€Â  Dr. McClure explained that Ms. M doesnâ€™t â€œthink wellâ€ and that \r\n  her â€œmemory is poor and sheâ€™s just not able to cognate well.â€\r\nDr. McClure added that Alzheimerâ€™s disease, which he \r\n  described as a degenerative illness in which brain cells die and never regenerate, \r\n  caused Ms. Mâ€™s dementia.Â  He confirmed that the disease causes a decrease in \r\n  higher cortical functioning, which leads to a loss of reasoning and impaired \r\n  judgment.Â  Dr. McClure concluded that on March 12, 1999, Ms. M lacked â€œsufficient \r\n  mental capacity to understand legal documents such as a revocation or creation \r\n  of a power of attorney.â€\r\nDr. Linda June Campbell, who saw Ms. M for a physical \r\n  examination on March 12, 1999, testified for Appellants. [8] Â  As an internist, Dr. Campbell acknowledged that a neurologist \r\n  â€œwould definitely have more expertise than an internistâ€ for evaluating a patientâ€™s \r\n  mental status.\r\nMs. M was by accompanied to Dr. Campbellâ€™s office \r\n  by Lynn Douglass and caretaker Lil Heller.Â Â  Lynn Douglass had called Dr. Campbell \r\n  and scheduled the appointment.Â  Dr. Campbell testified that while Ms. M was \r\n  in her office, one of her nurses attempted a â€œmini mental status examâ€ of Ms. \r\n  M, but Ms. Mâ€™s lack of cooperation prevented the nurse from finishing.Â  She \r\n  testified that Ms. M â€œdefinitely had Alzheimerâ€™sâ€ disease and â€œhad some mild \r\n  dementia, for sure.â€Â  Nevertheless, Dr. Campbell testified that on March 12, \r\n  1999, Ms. M understood â€œthe objects of her affection and extent of properties,â€ \r\n  and â€œthe nature and the effect of her actions, particularly with regards to \r\n  legal documents[.]â€Â  The trial court found, as do we, Dr. Campbellâ€™s testimony \r\n  unpersuasive.Â  When asked if she claimed â€œto have any expertise in the area \r\n  of Alzheimerâ€™s disease or dementia,â€ she replied, â€œI donâ€™t.â€\r\nOf similar import was the testimony of Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  second medical expert, Dr. Edward Zamrini.Â  Dr. Zamrini, a â€œbehavioral neurologist,â€ \r\n  determined that Ms. M suffered from â€œmild to moderateâ€ dementia.Â  He opined, \r\n  however, that Ms. M had the ability on March 12, 1999, to make â€œa rational decision \r\n  about what she wanted to do with her property[.]â€Â  Significantly, Dr. Zamrini \r\n  never reviewed the records of the other neurologists, although he requested \r\n  such records from Appellants.Â  At trial, Dr. Zamrini acknowledged that he â€œdefinitelyâ€ \r\n  would have preferred to have been provided with Ms. Mâ€™s medical records.  \r\n  [9] \r\nA review of the lay testimony supports the findings \r\n  of the trial court. Frank Eppes, a former circuit court judge and long-time \r\n  friend of Ms. M and her late brother, testified that he had been a frequent \r\n  overnight guest in their home when he held court in Fairfield County.Â  Judge \r\n  Eppes visited Ms. M an estimated ten times a year for thirty years preceding \r\n  1998.Â  He noted that Ms. M displayed photographs of Dr. Gaddy and his family \r\n  in her home, that she considered Dr. Gaddy her son and his children her grandchildren, \r\n  and that Ms. M enjoyed spending her holidays with the Gaddyâ€™s.\r\nJudge Eppes observed that Ms. Mâ€™s home had become flea-infested \r\n  and full of junk.Â  Judge Eppes was well aware of Ms. Mâ€™s mental decline, even \r\n  to the point that he discontinued his overnight stays due to concerns that in \r\n  her confusion she might shoot him by accident.Â  His visits with Ms. M came to \r\n  an end in October 1998 because her confusion was so great that she no longer \r\n  recognized him.Â  It was Judge Eppesâ€™ firm conviction that Ms. M was permanently \r\n  and mentally incapacitated, and unable to understand legal documents.Â  Judge \r\n  Eppes finally observed that it was Dr. Gaddy, not Ms. Mâ€™s family, who had a \r\n  positive presence in her life.\r\nEarl Wilkes, a former neighbor of Ms. Mâ€™s, began noticing \r\n  a decline in Ms. Mâ€™s health in 1996.Â  He recounted incidents where Ms. M lost \r\n  her car, locked herself out of her house, and seemed confused.Â  He said she \r\n  often appeared dirty and failed to take care of her personal hygiene.\r\nRosemary Wade, one of Ms. Mâ€™s caretakers from the fall \r\n  of 1997 until March 1999, testified that Ms. M did not understand what she watched \r\n  on television, could not remember trips or locations from which she had just \r\n  returned, and could not even order meals from a restaurant menu.Â  Wade witnessed \r\n  Ms. M suffer from nighttime agitation and wander from the house at night.Â  She \r\n  added that Ms. M required assistance to handle basic activities of daily living, \r\n  such as dressing herself, preparing meals, or bathing. \r\nDavid Byrd, a private investigator and process server \r\n  to whom Appellants had paid approximately $1,500 for investigative work, witnessed \r\n  Ms. Mâ€™s execution of the 1999 durable power of attorney and revocation.Â  Byrd \r\n  first met Ms. M at attorney Truslowâ€™s office on March 12, 1999.Â  Byrd admitted \r\n  that at the time he had no knowledge of her Alzheimerâ€™s disease, dementia, or \r\n  that Ms. M required constant care because of her dementia.Â  Nevertheless, Byrd \r\n  was willing to opine that Ms. M â€œunderstood the nature and effect of the action[s] \r\n  she was takingâ€ in signing the documents at Truslowâ€™s office. \r\n  [10] \r\nMs. Mâ€™s January 2002 deposition was also admitted.Â  \r\n  Ms. M claimed to pay her own bills and clean her own house, although she had \r\n  done neither since at least 1996.Â  She mistakenly claimed to drive her own car, \r\n  as well as her tractor.Â  Ms. M testified that she had no caretakers or aids, \r\n  and that she was capable of taking care of herself, although she had continuous \r\n  caretakers since 1996.Â  She claimed she had no attorney, although Cameron B. \r\n  Littlejohn, Jr., her attorney of record, was seated with her at the deposition.Â  \r\n  She could not name the President of the United States, Vice President of the \r\n  United States, or the Governor of South Carolina.Â  Ms. M failed several simple \r\n  memory tests, including identifying three objects shown to her minutes before.Â  \r\n  She could not recall where she ate lunch that day.Â  When asked if she may have \r\n  revoked the 1988 power of attorney, Ms. M replied, â€œGood Lord, what do you expect \r\n  me to remember something [sic] twelve years ago?Â  I donâ€™t remember what happened \r\n  yesterday.â€\r\nThe trial court issued its final order in May 2001.Â  \r\n  Having determined that Dr. Gaddyâ€™s witnesses were â€œparticularly credible,â€ he \r\n  found, as do we, that â€œthe medical testimony clearly indicates â€¦ that [Ms. M] \r\n  lacked mental capacity to understand or to execute any kind of legal documents \r\n  in March 1999.â€Â  He based his conclusion on evidence that she suffered from \r\n  severe dementia caused by Alzheimerâ€™s disease, which he found progressively \r\n  destroys brain cells, resulting in the progressive loss of cognitive functioning. \r\n\r\nThe trial court concluded that Ms. M lacked contractual \r\n  and testamentary capacity â€œfrom March 12, 1999 and continuously thereafter.â€Â  \r\n  As a result, he invalidated the 1999 revocation of the 1988 durable power of \r\n  attorney and the 1988 Will.Â  He also invalidated the 1999 durable power of attorney, \r\n  and declared valid the 1988 durable power of attorney.Â  Finally, he awarded \r\n  Dr. Gaddy litigation expenses to be paid from Ms. Mâ€™s assets.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSince 1986, the South Carolina Legislature \r\n  has expressly authorized and sanctioned the use and efficacy of durable \r\n  powers of attorneys. [11] Â  \r\n  S.C. General Assembly Act No. 539, Â§ 1.Â  Section 62-5-501 of the Code of Laws \r\n  of South Carolina (Supp. 2003) provides in part:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever a principal designates another his \r\n  attorney in fact by a power of attorney in writing and the writing contains \r\n  (1) the words â€œThis power of attorney is not affected by physical disability \r\n  or mental incompetence of the principal which renders the principal incapable \r\n  of managing his own estateâ€,â€¦ or (3) similar words showing the intent of the \r\n  principal that the authority conferred is exercisable notwithstanding his physical \r\n  disability or mental incompetence or either physical disability or mental incompetence, \r\n  the authority of the attorney in fact is exercisable by him as provided in the \r\n  power on behalf of the principal notwithstanding later physical disability or \r\n  mental incompetence of the principal â€¦\r\n\r\nUpon the execution of a durable \r\n  power of attorney, the attorney-in-fact retains authority to act on the principalâ€™s \r\n  behalf notwithstanding the subsequent physical disability or mental incompetence \r\n  of the principal.Â  To honor this unmistakable legislative intent, it is incumbent \r\n  on courts to uphold a durable power of attorney unless the principal retains \r\n  contractual capacity to revoke the then existing durable power of attorney or \r\n  to execute a new power of attorney.Â  Otherwise, the very purpose of section \r\n  62-5-501 would be undermined.\r\nContractual Capacity\r\nÂ Appellants contend the trial court \r\n  erred in finding Ms. M was incompetent to execute the 1999 durable power of \r\n  attorney and revocation.Â  We disagree, and find the evidence compellingly supports \r\n  the findings of the trial court.Â  \r\nâ€œ[I]n order to execute or revoke a valid power of \r\n  attorney, the principal must possess contractual capacity.â€Â  Thames, \r\n  344 S.C. at 570, 544 S.E.2d at 857.Â  Contractual capacity is generally defined \r\n  as a personâ€™s ability to understand in a meaningful way, at the time the contract \r\n  is executed, the nature, scope and effect of the contract.Â  In re Nightingaleâ€™s \r\n  Estate, 182 S.C. 527, 541, 189 S.E.2d 890, 896 (1937).Â  Where, as here, \r\n  the mental condition of the principal is of a chronic nature, evidence of the \r\n  principalâ€™s prior or subsequent condition is admissible as bearing upon his \r\n  or her condition at the time the contract is executed.Â  53 Am. Jur. 2d Mentally \r\n  Impaired Persons Â§ 157 (1996).Â  In McCollum v. Banks, 213 S.C. 476, \r\n  483, 50 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1948), our supreme court held a testatorâ€™s insanity, \r\n  in order to invalidate a will, should be established at the time of execution, \r\n  unless the insanity is â€œof a permanent or chronic nature.â€Â  See also \r\n  In re Brazmanâ€™s Will, 172 S.C. 188, 194, 173 S.E. 623, 625 (1934) (stating \r\n  if the evidence shows the insanity is chronic, it is presumed to continue).\r\nHere, the credible medical and lay testimony presented \r\n  compellingly indicates that Ms. M suffered from at least moderate to severe \r\n  dementia caused by Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, a chronic and permanent organic disease, \r\n  on March 12, 1999.Â  We are firmly persuaded that Ms. Mâ€™s dementia, chronic and \r\n  progressive in nature, clearly rendered her incapable of possessing contractual \r\n  capacity to revoke the 1988 durable power of attorney or execute the 1999 power \r\n  of attorney.Â  We find this conclusion inescapable based on the record before \r\n  us.\r\nSpecifically, the evidence supplied by Doctors \r\n  Carnes, Taylor and McClure established Ms. Mâ€™s history of debilitating dementia \r\n  dating back to 1996, as well as the progressive, chronic, organic, and irreversible \r\n  nature of the disease.Â  Although a patient suffering from such severe dementia \r\n  may at times appear normal, they opined such a patient could not make rational \r\n  decisions, understand the nature of his or her actions, or handle their business \r\n  or legal affairs.Â  The credible lay testimony of Judge Eppes, Earl Wilkes, and \r\n  Rosemary Wade provides forceful evidence corroborating the testimony ofÂ  these \r\n  three neurologists.\r\nIn contrast, the only expert medical testimony \r\n  supporting Appellantsâ€™ position that Ms. M possessed sufficient capacity to \r\n  execute or revoke a power of attorney came from their two medical experts, Drs. \r\n  Campbell and Zamrini.Â  As noted, Dr. Campbell, an internist, when asked if she \r\n  claimed â€œto have any expertise in the area of Alzheimerâ€™s disease or dementia,â€ \r\n  replied, â€œI donâ€™t.â€Â  Dr. Zamriniâ€™s testimony is similarly lacking, primarily \r\n  as a result of the false medical history provided to him by Appellants. \r\nBased on our view of the evidence, \r\n  we conclude that by at least March 12, 1999, and at all times thereafter, Ms. \r\n  M lacked contractual capacity because she suffered from severe dementia caused \r\n  by Alzheimerâ€™s disease, a chronic illness involving the irreversible degeneration \r\n  of brain cells. [12] Â  \r\nTestamentary Capacity\r\nAppellants assert the trial court \r\n  erred in addressing Ms. Mâ€™s testamentary capacity on March 12, 1999.Â  We reluctantly \r\n  agree, and vacate that portion of the trial courtâ€™s order finding Ms. M lacked \r\n  testamentary capacity on March 12, 1999.\r\nDr. Gaddy did not plead the issue \r\n  of Ms. Mâ€™s testamentary capacity.Â  In his complaint, he sought relief from the \r\n  attempted revocation of the 1988 power of attorney, not revocation of the 1988 \r\n  Will.Â  The trial court addressed the issue of testamentary capacity on its own \r\n  volition because the revocations were contained in the same document, and because \r\n  it believed the best use of judicial resources favored disposing of all issues \r\n  in one action. We concur with the trial courtâ€™s sentiment to achieve finality \r\n  regarding testamentary capacity and to avoid further siphoning by Appellants \r\n  of Ms. Mâ€™s assets.Â  Having failed, however, to plead the matter of testamentary \r\n  capacity in the context of the purported revocation of the 1988 Will, we find \r\n  it was error for the trial court to address and decide the issue, especially \r\n  in light of Appellantsâ€™ objection at the commencement of the trial to the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s consideration of the matter.Â  We, therefore, vacate that portion of \r\n  the circuit court judgment concerning the issue of testamentary capacity. [13]   \r\nNecessary Party\r\nAppellants argue the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision must be vacated due to the absence of a necessary party, Ms. M.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nWe find Ms. M was adequately \r\n  represented in this action because Dr. Gaddy brought this action as Ms. Mâ€™s \r\n  attorney-in-fact, and therefore, the action was brought on her behalf.Â  â€œWhenever \r\n  a[n]â€¦incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, \r\n  conservator or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on \r\n  behalf of the ... incompetent person ....â€Â  Rule 17(c), SCRCP.Â Â  Ms. M was incompetent \r\n  prior to and at the time Dr. Gaddy brought this action.Â  Therefore, under Rule \r\n  17(c), Ms. M was not required to be individually named as a party in this action. \r\n  [14] Â  \r\nWe further note Appellants never \r\n  raised this issue in the trial court. \r\n  [15] Â  Appellants, in an attempt to circumvent issue preservation rules, \r\n  seek to recast the argument as one of subject matter jurisdiction by claiming \r\n  that Ms. M is an indispensable party under Rule 19, SCRCP.Â  Ms. Mâ€™s incompetence \r\n  involves her â€œcapacity to sue or be suedâ€ as the real party in interest which \r\n  invokes Rule 17.Â  â€œRule 17â€¦ clearly indicates the question of real party in \r\n  interest does not involve subject matter jurisdiction.â€Â Â Â  Bardoon Properties, \r\n  NV v. Eidolon Corp., 326 S.C. 166, 170, 485 S.E.2d 371, 373 (1997). \r\n  [16] Â  We conclude the issue is not preserved for our review.Â Â  See \r\n  Toal, Vafai, and Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina at \r\n  63 (2d Ed. 2002) (citing Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d 187 (1997) for the proposition that issue preservation requires â€œthat \r\n  the objection in the trial court must have been made by the party who raises \r\n  the issue in the appellate court.â€).Â  \r\nLitigation Expenses \r\nAppellants claim the trial court erred in authorizing \r\n  Dr. Gaddy to reimburse his litigation expenses from Ms. Mâ€™s assets. We affirm \r\n  in result.\r\nThe 1988 power of attorney specifically authorizes \r\n  Dr. Gaddy to â€œinstitute, prosecute â€¦ or otherwise engage in litigation involving \r\n  me, my property or any interests of mine; â€¦ to employ â€¦ attorneys-at-law â€¦ for \r\n  the proper administration of my property â€¦ to pay and adjust debts incurred \r\n  by me or by my attorney-in-fact in connection with any power authorized hereunder.â€Â  \r\n  Because we find Dr. Gaddy was acting on behalf of Ms. M as her attorney-in-fact \r\n  when he instituted this action, the language of the 1988 power of attorney, \r\n  which provides for payment of such litigation expenses, controls.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we affirm the trial courtâ€™s award of litigation expenses to Dr. Gaddy based \r\n  on the language in the 1988 power of attorney.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. \r\n  Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 417, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000) (stating \r\n  that the appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).Â  \r\n  We reiterate that Dr. Gaddy was acting appropriately and within his fiduciary \r\n  capacity in bringing this action. [17]   \r\nPropriety of Judge Hughston Serving as Trial Judge\r\nAppellants argue that Judge Hughston \r\n  lacked jurisdiction and impartiality.Â  These contentions, asserted for the first \r\n  time on appeal, are utterly specious.Â  In light of the serious nature of these \r\n  allegations, we elect to review the procedural history.Â  \r\nJudge Hughston was assigned by South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  Chief Justice, through the Office of Court Administration, to a common pleas \r\n  nonjury term in the sixth judicial circuit in October 1999.Â  During that term \r\n  of court, pending motions in this case came before Judge Hughston, one of which \r\n  was a motion to designate the case as complex.Â  Judge Hughston recognized that \r\n  designation of a case as complex is generally a function of the chief administrative \r\n  judge for the circuit.Â  It was observed, however, that the resident circuit \r\n  judges of the sixth circuit, including the then current administrative judge, \r\n  were disqualified due to conflicts.Â  Consequently, at the request of the parties, \r\n  Judge Hughston agreed to resolve the motions, handle pretrial matters and preside \r\n  over the trial.\r\nThe trial commenced on February 19, 2001.Â  \r\n  Judge Hughston was assigned by the Chief Justice to preside over the February \r\n  19 term of court.Â  Following four days of testimony, Judge Hughston took the \r\n  matter under advisement and issued his final order on May 2, 2001.Â  \r\nFrom Judge Hughstonâ€™s initial involvement \r\n  in this case in October of 1999 through the issuance of the final order, the \r\n  record contains not the slightest hint of a challenge to Judge Hughstonâ€™s authority \r\n  or impartiality.Â  Moreover, Appellants filed a motion to alter the judgment \r\n  on May 18, 2001, containing forty-six grounds of error, none of which is directed \r\n  against Judge Hughstonâ€™s authority or impartiality.Â  In sum, at the trial level, \r\n  Appellants never took exception to either Judge Hughstonâ€™s involvement \r\n  in or handling of this case.Â  \r\nOn appeal, we hear for the first time \r\n  that Judge Hughston was an â€œadvocate in these proceedings,â€ and that his involvement \r\n  â€œaffected his ability to impartially try the case.â€Â  The simple response is \r\n  that this court will not address matters not raised and ruled upon in the trial \r\n  court.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilkie, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 \r\n  (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on \r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be \r\n  preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  In an effort to circumvent the issue preservation \r\n  rule, a fundamental principle of appellate procedure with which Appellants are \r\n  familiar, we are once again confronted with a subject matter jurisdiction claim.Â  \r\n  We reject this desperate, eleventh-hour attack on Judge Hughston and the assertion \r\n  that he lacked jurisdiction to preside over this case.Â  His authority to render \r\n  judgment is beyond question, and if Appellants desired his recusal, they should \r\n  have done so in a proper and timely manner.Â  See Parker v. Shecut, \r\n  340 S.C. 460, 496-97, 531 S.E.2d 546, 566 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding the issue \r\n  of recusal of the trial judge, to be preserved for appellate review, must be \r\n  raised in the trial court).\r\nLifting of the Automatic Stay\r\nOn October 10, 2001, a panel of this court enforced \r\n  an automatic stay of the trial courtâ€™s order, and â€œrevivedâ€ the March 12, 1999 \r\n  revocation of the 1998 durable power of attorney, as well as the 1999 power \r\n  of attorney naming Appellants as Ms. Mâ€™s attorneys-in-fact.Â  With our decision \r\n  today, we immediately lift the automatic stay as provided in the October 10, \r\n  2001 order and Rule 225, SCACR. Dr. Gaddy shall immediately resume his responsibilities \r\n  as the legal, duly authorized attorney-in-fact for Ms. M.Â  Appellants George \r\n  G. Douglass, III, and William P. Sherrod are hereby enjoined from conducting \r\n  any business on behalf of Ms. M.Â  Additionally, Appellants George G. Douglass, \r\n  III, and William P. Sherrod shall within five days of receipt hereof deliver \r\n  to Dr. Gaddy, through counsel, all documents pertaining to Ms. M, including \r\n  all financial records, and as provided in the decree of the trial courtâ€™s final \r\n  order of May 2, 2001.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe very idea of a durable power of attorney is to protect \r\n  the principal should he or she become incapacitated.Â  This case is precisely \r\n  the type of situation for which the durable power of attorney is intended.Â  \r\n  On March 12, 1999, Ms. M, due to her chronic and severe dementia, lacked capacity \r\n  to revoke the 1988 durable power of attorney and execute the 1999 power of attorney, \r\n  and the evidence in this regard is overwhelming. In so holding, we return to \r\n  Dr. Gaddy his fiduciary obligations to Ms. M, which he faithfully discharged \r\n  prior to Appellantsâ€™ regrettable involvement.Â  The decision of the trial court \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART. \r\n HEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We recognize that Ms. Mâ€™s true identity may be discovered \r\n    through public records and otherwise.Â  We merely desire to preserve some vestige \r\n    of respect and decency for this elderly woman as she faces the end of her \r\n    lifeâ€™s journey in the grip of debilitating dementia caused by Alzheimerâ€™s \r\n    disease.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Dr. Gaddy has continuously practiced medicine in Fairfield \r\n    County since 1981, during which time he served as chief of staff at a local \r\n    hospital and president of the South Carolina Medical Association.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  At one time, Ms. Mâ€™s assets included a 200-acre farm in Fairfeld \r\n    County, on which her home was situated, securities, and a checking account \r\n    containing approximately $339,000 in cash.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court found that Heller â€œhad at least some bias \r\n    in favor ofâ€ Appellants because Dr. Gaddy had declined her repeated requests \r\n    to be switched from her weekend shift to a weekday shift.Â  Once Appellants \r\n    assumed control of Ms. Mâ€™s affairs in March 1999, they rewarded Heller with \r\n    the shift she wanted and several pay raises.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ms. M did not schedule the appointment with Truslow.Â  It is \r\n    not our intent to assign nefarious motives to Truslow, for he was simply a \r\n    pawn in Appellantsâ€™ scheme to gain control over Ms. Mâ€™s assets.Â  Indeed, Truslow \r\n    admitted that he â€œmight have done things differentlyâ€ had he known the truth \r\n    about Ms. Mâ€™s condition. Â When asked if â€œthereâ€™s some things that you \r\n    now know that you did not know when you [sic] executed the revocationsâ€ Truslow \r\n    responded, â€œThatâ€™s an understatement.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [6]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The resident judges of the sixth judicial circuit, where Fairfield \r\n    County is located, were disqualified due to conflicts.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Dr. Carnes found nothing to suggest Ms. M suffered from brain \r\n    tumors or stroke.Â  He further determined that her medications or outside stress \r\n    did not affect his diagnosis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Dr. Campbell testified that she had examined Ms. M approximately \r\n    eight times since March 1999, but limited her testimony to the findings from \r\n    her examinations in that month.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  In fairness to Dr. Zamrini, he was misled by Appellants, similar \r\n    to their deceit of attorney Truslow.Â  Dr. Zamriniâ€™s report reveals Appellantsâ€™ \r\n    efforts to recast the medical history of Ms. M.Â Â  For example, Appellants \r\n    desired that Dr. Zamrini believe that Ms. Mâ€™s dementia was first noticed in \r\n    1996 with an â€œabrupt onset.â€ Â A review of the medical records establishes \r\n    the progressive nature of Ms. Mâ€™s dementia.Â  When confronted on cross-examination \r\n    with the fact that short-term memory loss was documented in 1993, Dr. Zamrini \r\n    could only respond, â€œI was not aware of that.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [10]  Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court assigned little weight to Byrdâ€™s testimony, \r\n    primarily as a result of his financial ties to Appellants.Â  Our assessment \r\n    of Byrdâ€™s testimony is the same.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [11] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œDurableâ€ is a term of art signifying that a power of attorney \r\n    survives the principalâ€™s disability.Â  See Â 3 Am.Jur.2d Agency Â§ 28 \r\n    (1986).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [12]  Â Â Â Â Â  We in no way suggest that all people suffering some degree \r\n    of dementia, from Alzheimerâ€™s disease or otherwise, invariably lack contractual \r\n    capacity.Â  We hold that the subject of contractual capacity of \r\n    one suffering dementia should be decided in a fact-driven, individualized \r\n    manner.Â  There may well be situations where an individual at the onset of \r\n    Alzheimerâ€™s disease, or in the early stages of dementia, may retain sufficient \r\n    capacity to contract.Â  This, however, is not such a case, for Ms. Mâ€™s capacity \r\n    to contract had long since passed when her previously absent family members \r\n    entered her life and attempted to gain control of her assets.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [13]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Having disposed of this issue on the ground of failure \r\n    to plead, we do not address the jurisdictional question whether oneâ€™s testamentary \r\n    capacity may be determined prior to death.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [14]  Â Â Â Â Â  From a legal and practical standpoint, it is beyond challenge \r\n    (even from Appellantsâ€™ view of the evidence) that Ms. M was incompetent when \r\n    the case was tried.Â  That undeniable fact essentially renders this issue moot, \r\n    for Ms. M was either represented by Dr. Gaddy pursuant to the 1988 power of \r\n    attorney or by Appellants pursuant to the 1999 power of attorney.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [15]  Â Â Â Â Â  At trial, Appellants only objected to the inclusion of the \r\n    word â€œpurportedâ€ in the caption when listing their names as Ms. Mâ€™s attorneys-in-fact.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â  \r\n    [16] Â Â Â Â Â  For a more thorough discussion on the lack of a relationship \r\n    between a partyâ€™s status as a real party in interest and subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n    see Bardoon Properties, NV v. Eidolon Corp., supra.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [17] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find it extremely troubling that by May 2001, Appellants \r\n    had paid from Ms. Mâ€™s funds approximately $160,000 for attorney fees and costs \r\n    they incurred.Â  Appellants did so without court authorization, as they apparently \r\n    believed they could do so unilaterally under the language of the 1999 power \r\n    of attorney.Â  Incredibly, Appellants criticize Dr. Gaddy for incurring approximately \r\n    $90,000 in legal fees, while they make no mention of their unapologetic invasion \r\n    into Ms. Mâ€™s funds to pay their legal fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3772","title":"State v.

Swerling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  all of Columbia; David Michael Pascoe, Jr. and Jonathan S. Gasser, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  Helen Marie Douglas was \r\n  convicted of murder and armed robbery.Â  She received concurrent sentences of \r\n  life imprisonment for murder and thirty years imprisonment for armed robbery.Â  \r\n  Douglas appeals.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nDouglas and her husband, Ronnie Douglas, \r\n  owned two houses in Colleton County.Â  Douglas was in the habit of staying at \r\n  the river house, and Ronnie usually stayed at the house in town.Â  On the morning \r\n  of November 3, 1997, Douglas knocked on a neighborâ€™s door across the street \r\n  from the town house, explaining that something had happened to Ronnie.Â  The \r\n  neighbor called 911 and went with Douglas to the town house, which she stated \r\n  appeared to be ransacked.Â  The neighbor also testified that Ronnieâ€™s head was \r\n  surrounded by blood and he did not have a pulse.Â  Douglas and the neighbor then \r\n  left the house, and the neighbor called Douglasâ€™s two sons.Â  Police arrived \r\n  at the scene and determined there was no evidence of forced entry.Â Â  A treating \r\n  paramedic testified that Ronnie was dead and appeared to have a gunshot wound \r\n  to the head.  [1]   \r\nDouglas gave two statements to police \r\n  in the days following Ronnieâ€™s murder.Â  On each occasion, officers advised Douglas \r\n  of her Miranda [2]  rights before openly tape-recording her statements.Â  \r\n  Douglas later called Investigator Stanfield, the investigating officer, and \r\n  asked him to come speak to her at the river house.Â  The officers decided to \r\n  send Stanfield out to the house with a hidden tape recorder.Â  When he met with \r\n  Douglas he did not advise her of her Miranda rights.Â  Though Douglas \r\n  did not make any incriminating comments about Ronnieâ€™s murder, she did admit \r\n  that she had lied to the police about having an extramarital affair at the time \r\n  of Ronnieâ€™s death.Â  Though finding the secret tape-recording a â€œvery, very, \r\n  very poor practice,â€ the trial judge allowed admission of a redacted version \r\n  of the recording at trial.Â Â Â Â  \r\nDouglasâ€™s son, Ronald, testified that Douglas gave \r\n  her house keys to his brother, Tony, when she was arrested.Â  Ronald testified \r\n  that he made a copy of these keys without informing either Tony or Douglas.Â  \r\n  Ronald stated he used these keys to enter the river house at least three times \r\n  â€“ once by himself and twice with his ex-wife.Â  He said he wanted to retrieve \r\n  his video camera, his daughterâ€™s clothing, and some of his fatherâ€™s personal \r\n  possessions.Â  During one of these searches, Ronaldâ€™s ex-wife discovered a bag \r\n  of .25-caliber bullets and an empty box containing a receipt for a .25-caliber \r\n  pistol.Â  Ronald took several items from the house to the police, explaining \r\n  he was searching for his fatherâ€™s wallet.Â  Ronald also told police that, in \r\n  the course of searching the pool pump house, he cut off the lock and threw it \r\n  into the creek.Â  Investigator Stanfield stated, â€œwe told [Ronald] if anything \r\n  came up with the investigation that needed our attention, please bring it to \r\n  our attention.â€Â Â  \r\nApproximately eighteen months after Ronnieâ€™s murder, \r\n  some homeowners found a garbage bag in the creek in their backyard.Â  Douglasâ€™s \r\n  river house was located on the nearby river.Â  The bag contained rocks and a \r\n  brick.Â  A second bag, which was within the first bag, contained surgical gloves, \r\n  two shirts, and a pair of jeans.Â  One of Douglasâ€™s daughters-in-law testified \r\n  one of the shirts was Douglasâ€™s, and that the jeans were in Douglasâ€™s size.Â  \r\n  However, the only hair sample found on the clothing did not match Douglas.Â  \r\n  After these items were turned over to police, the police conducted an underwater \r\n  search of the creek.Â  Police found a cinder block used to weigh down Ronnieâ€™s \r\n  wallet and a .25-caliber handgun. [3] Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn further support of its theory that Douglas killed \r\n  her husband, the State presented testimony from an insurance agent, Gary Wayne \r\n  Walker.Â  Walker testified that he ran into Douglas at the river house in September \r\n  1997.Â  Walker stated Douglas was interested in purchasing a life insurance policy \r\n  on Ronnieâ€™s life.Â  Walker advised Douglas that he could not issue such a policy \r\n  without Ronnieâ€™s consent.Â  Walker later discussed prices with Douglas, but did \r\n  not actually give her the quotes. \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Douglas moved for a directed \r\n  verdict on the murder charge, arguing the Stateâ€™s case was purely circumstantial \r\n  in nature.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  Douglas also moved for a directed \r\n  verdict on the armed robbery charge, arguing the State had not proved the essential \r\n  elements of the offense.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  The jury subsequently \r\n  found Douglas guilty of both murder and armed robbery.Â Â  Douglas renewed her \r\n  motions for a directed verdict after the verdict was handed down.Â  The trial \r\n  judge denied these post-trial motions.Â  The trial judge levied a life sentence \r\n  on the murder charge and a concurrent sentence of thirty years imprisonment \r\n  for armed robbery.Â  Douglas appeals both of her convictions as well as her sentence \r\n  for murder.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court \r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual \r\n  findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  This same standard of review applies \r\n  to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain \r\n  evidence in criminal cases.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Admission of Evidence\r\nDouglas argues the trial judge erred in allowing \r\n  the admission of several types of evidence.Â  She states the following should \r\n  not have been admitted at trial:Â  (1) Walkerâ€™s testimony about Douglasâ€™s interest \r\n  in an insurance policy; (2) the secretly-taped statement given to Investigator \r\n  Stanfield; (3) the items found by Ronald during his searches of the river house; \r\n  and (4) the items found in the creek.\r\nRelevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having any \r\n  tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination \r\n  of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  \r\n  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is \r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence \r\n  is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not \r\n  be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Saltz, \r\n  346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001).Â  To warrant reversal, an appellant \r\n  must show not only an alleged error, but also resulting prejudice.Â  State \r\n  v. Thompson, 305 S.C. 496, 502, 409 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1991) (stating \r\n  the admission and exclusion of evidence is largely a matter of the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  discretion, and the judgeâ€™s rulings will not be overturned on appeal unless \r\n  the judge committed a manifest abuse of discretion and the defendant suffered \r\n  prejudice as a result).\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Insurance Testimony  \r\nDouglas contends the trial judge erred in admitting \r\n  the testimony of Gary Wayne Walker.Â  She asserts the probative value of the \r\n  testimony was outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial effect. \r\nWalker testified he had known Douglas and her husband \r\n  since the early 1970â€™s.Â  In September of 1997, approximately two months \r\n  before the murder, Walker came in contact with Douglas.Â  He stated he was in \r\n  the area near Douglasâ€™s river house looking at property when he saw Douglas \r\n  near the road.Â  Walker stopped and spoke with Douglas.Â  During the conversation, \r\n  Douglas inquired whether Walker was still employed at the fire department.Â  \r\n  Walker told Douglas he had left the fire department and gotten into the insurance \r\n  business.Â  Walker testified Douglas asked about types of insurance and, then, \r\n  â€œfrom there the conversation led to she was interested in some insurance on \r\n  Ronnie, asked me if I could get her a quote on some insurance, which I did.â€Â  \r\n  Walker acknowledged that in order to issue an insurance policy he would have \r\n  needed Ronnieâ€™s permission.Â  Walker stated that some time after this conversation \r\n  he again came in contact with Douglas.Â  At that time, Walker informed Douglas \r\n  that he had the insurance quotes.Â  Walker testified he never gave these quotes \r\n  to Douglas. \r\nOur Supreme Court has consistently held that evidence \r\n  of a life insurance policy on the victim in a homicide case may be admissible \r\n  to establish a defendantâ€™s motive.Â  To be admissible, however, the evidence \r\n  must show that the defendant would derive some benefit from the proceeds of \r\n  the policy.Â  See, e.g., State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 150, 508 \r\n  S.E.2d 857, 865 (1998) (holding evidence that defendant carried a life insurance \r\n  policy on the victim may be admissible to show defendantâ€™s motive for the homicide); \r\n  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 339, 468 S.E.2d 626, 633 (1996), cert. \r\n  denied, Williams v. South Carolina, 519 U.S. 891 (1996) (finding \r\n  evidence that defendant had substantially increased life insurance benefits \r\n  for wife and son immediately prior to the homicides constituted some circumstantial \r\n  evidence of defendantâ€™s motive); State v. Vermillion, 271 S.C. 99, 100, \r\n  245 S.E.2d 128, 129 (1978) (holding â€œit is not necessary to show that the defendant \r\n  was the beneficiary under a policy of life insurance on the life of the deceased \r\n  in order to render it relevant and admissible if there is some showing that \r\n  the defendant would derive some benefit from the proceeds of the policyâ€).Â  \r\n\r\nHere, there was no policy from which Douglas could \r\n  derive some benefit.Â  Instead, the testimony only established that Douglas inquired \r\n  about a policy and never followed through with confirming the quotes and obtaining \r\n  her husbandâ€™s approval.Â  Motive cannot be established through the non-purchase \r\n  of an insurance policy.Â  To hold otherwise, we would significantly extend the \r\n  established precedent that requires the existence of a policy.Â  Moreover, Douglas \r\n  was clearly prejudiced by the inference that she was attempting to purchase \r\n  additional insurance on her husbandâ€™s life without his knowledge just prior \r\n  to his death.Â  As such, we find the judge erred in admitting Walkerâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial. \r\n  [4] \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Tape-Recorded Statement\r\nDouglas argues the trial judge erred in admitting \r\n  her statement that was surreptitiously recorded by Investigator Stanfield while \r\n  she spoke with him at her home. \r\nDuring a pre-trial conference, Douglasâ€™s counsel \r\n  objected to the admission of the taped statement primarily on the ground that \r\n  the prejudicial value of its admission outweighed the probative value.Â  Counsel \r\n  contended the investigator believed Douglas was the only suspect and was trying \r\n  to get her to confess even though she had not done so on two prior occasions \r\n  when she had given statements.Â  The judge took the motion under advisement, \r\n  but indicated â€œthe Miranda issue [is] a lot stronger than the one party \r\n  tape issue.â€\r\nAt trial, Douglasâ€™s counsel again asserted Douglas \r\n  was entitled to a Miranda warning at the time the statement was taped \r\n  because she was a suspect and had been given her Miranda rights when \r\n  she gave the earlier two statements.Â  In response, the State argued Miranda \r\n  was inapplicable given Douglas was not â€œin custodyâ€ at the time the statement \r\n  was made.Â Â  The judge continued the discussion, asking counsel to analyze the \r\n  issue â€œin terms of Mirandaâ€ and â€œprivacy.â€Â  Ultimately, the judge allowed \r\n  the tape, in a redacted form, to be played for the jury.Â  The judge indicated \r\n  he had problems with the privacy aspect, but he did not believe it rose to the \r\n  level of being inadmissible.Â Â  \r\n Miranda warnings are required \r\n  only when a suspect â€œâ€˜has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his \r\n  freedom of action in any significant way.â€™â€Â  State v. Easler, 327 S.C. \r\n  121, 127, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1997) (quoting Miranda v. Arizona, 384 \r\n  U.S. 436, 444 (1966)).Â  â€œIn determining whether a suspect is â€˜in custody,â€™ the \r\n  totality of the circumstances, including the individualâ€™s freedom to leave the \r\n  scene and the purpose, place and length of the questioning must be considered.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the suspectâ€™s \r\n  position would have believed herself to be in custody.Â  Id. at 128, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d at 621.\r\nIn the instant case, we find Douglas was not in \r\n  custody when she was secretly tape-recorded by Investigator Stanfield.Â  Several \r\n  days after receiving Miranda warnings and giving two formal statements \r\n  to police, Douglas called Stanfield and asked to speak with him at her river \r\n  house.Â  Stanfield testified that she stated she â€œneeded to tell [him] somethingâ€ \r\n  and asked him to â€œcome alone.â€Â  While she did not know she was being tape-recorded, \r\n  Douglas was undoubtedly aware she was speaking to the investigating officer \r\n  about her husbandâ€™s murder.Â  As the conversation took place at Douglasâ€™s residence, \r\n  and at her request, she was clearly in control of the conversation.Â  Further, \r\n  given the circumstances under which the conversation took place, we fail to \r\n  see why Douglas would not have felt free to leave the scene.Â  Upon examining \r\n  the totality of the circumstances surrounding the tape-recording incident, it \r\n  is clear â€“ under the reasonable person standard â€“ that Douglas would not have \r\n  believed she was in police custody when she had her conversation with Stanfield.Â  \r\n  Because Douglas invited Investigator Stanfield to her home, she was not in custody \r\n  and, therefore, Miranda would not be applicable.Â  \r\nMoreover, the fact that Douglas was considered a suspect \r\n  or that she had previously been apprised of her Miranda rights is not \r\n  dispositive given she was not in custody.Â  See State v. Neely, \r\n  271 S.C. 33, 41, 244 S.E.2d 522, 527 (1978) (â€œâ€˜[A] noncustodial situation is \r\n  not converted to one in which Miranda applies simply because a reviewing \r\n  court concludes that, even in the absence of any formal arrest or restraint \r\n  on freedom of movement, the questioning took place in a â€˜coercive environment.â€™â€ \r\n  (quoting Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977))); Id. \r\n  (â€œâ€˜But police officers are not required to administer Miranda warnings \r\n  to everyone whom they question.Â  Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed \r\n  simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because \r\n  the questioned person is one whom the police suspect.â€™â€); State v. Sprouse, \r\n  325 S.C. 275, 282, 478 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding the fact that \r\n  an investigation focuses on the suspect does not trigger the Miranda \r\n  warnings unless he or she is in custody).Â  \r\nFinally, we disagree with Douglasâ€™s contention that the prejudicial \r\n  value of the evidence outweighed its probative effect.Â  During the statement, \r\n  Douglas repeatedly stated that she did not want her affair with Webster to get \r\n  out to her sons or become public knowledge.Â  In response, Investigator Stanfield \r\n  indicated there was nothing he could do because Webster had already given a \r\n  statement in which he admitted to the affair.Â  Douglas asked Stanfield to say \r\n  it was just a rumor and have the document â€œjust disappear.â€Â  Stanfield refused \r\n  to help hide the affair.Â  Given the Stateâ€™s case was entirely circumstantial, \r\n  the evidence was clearly probative.Â  A jury could have inferred from the evidence \r\n  that Douglas wanted Investigator Stanfield to destroy her paramourâ€™s statement, \r\n  which revealed inconsistent statements she made regarding her plans the morning \r\n  of the murder, her affair with Webster, as well as Ronnieâ€™s request for a divorce \r\n  the night before the murder. Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn any event, regardless of whether \r\n  Douglas was in custody at the time of the interrogation, any error in the failure \r\n  to suppress her statement was harmless given the substance of the conversation \r\n  was cumulative in nature. See State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, \r\n  329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978) (â€œUnder settled principles, the admission of \r\n  improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€).Â  \r\n  The redacted conversation that was read into evidence at trial did not contain \r\n  any incriminating statements about Ronnieâ€™s murder.Â  Rather, the conversation \r\n  appeared to concern Douglasâ€™s initial denial of having engaged in an extramarital \r\n  affair, and her subsequent fear that news of the affair would be made public.Â  \r\n\r\nOur decision should in no way \r\n  be interpreted that we condone the procedure employed by law enforcement.Â  However, \r\n  given the facts of this case and the specific arguments raised on appeal, we \r\n  must affirm the trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit the redacted version of Douglasâ€™s \r\n  tape-recorded statement into evidence. \r\n  [5] \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Private Search and Seizure\r\nDouglas asserts the trial judge erred in admitting \r\n  evidence that was obtained in a course of illegal searches and seizures.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Douglas contends that Ronald was acting for the State when he repeatedly searched \r\n  her home. \r\nâ€œ[A]n analysis of whether a private citizenâ€™s search and \r\n  seizure is attributable to the State requires an inquiry into the totality of \r\n  the circumstances.â€Â  State v. Cohen, 305 S.C. 432, 436, 409 S.E.2d 383, \r\n  386 (1991), cert. denied, Cohen v. South Carolina, 503 U.S. 942 \r\n  (1992).Â  â€œFactors to be considered include:Â  the citizenâ€™s motivation for the \r\n  search or seizure; the degree of governmental involvement, such as advice, encouragement, \r\n  knowledge about the nature of the citizenâ€™s activities, and the legality of \r\n  the conduct encouraged by the police.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe Fourth Amendment does \r\n  not bar a search and seizure, even an arbitrary one, effected by a private party \r\n  on his own initiative.â€Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d \r\n  661, 666 (2000), cert. denied, Brockman v. South Carolina, 530 \r\n  U.S. 1281 (2000).Â Â  â€œIt does, however, bar evidence arising from such intrusions \r\n  if the private party acted as an instrument or agent of the government.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œThe party challenging admission of evidence has the burden to show sufficient \r\n  government involvement in the private citizenâ€™s conduct to warrant fourth amendment \r\n  scrutiny.â€Â  Cohen, 305 S.C. at 434, 409 S.E.2d at 385.\r\nWe find the evidence collected by Ronald \r\n  at the river house and subsequently turned over to the police was the product \r\n  of private searches.Â  Ronald testified that he went to Douglasâ€™s river house \r\n  several times for general upkeep purposes and in order to retrieve personal \r\n  items, which included his video camera, his fatherâ€™s tools, and his daughterâ€™s \r\n  clothing.Â  Ronaldâ€™s ex-wife confirmed that, on the two occasions she accompanied \r\n  him to the river house, they were picking up personal possessions.Â  When asked \r\n  whether anyone told him to go out to the river house, Ronald stated he â€œ[d]id \r\n  it on [his] own.â€Â  As a result of these three searches, Ronald took insurance \r\n  papers, plats, deeds, and the bag containing the bullets and receipt for the \r\n  .25-caliber pistol to Stanfield, the investigating officer.Â  Stanfield testified \r\n  that he told Ronald â€œif anything came up with the investigation that needed \r\n  our attention, please bring it to our attention.â€Â  In our view, the testimony \r\n  provided by both Ronald and Stanfield supports the Stateâ€™s proposition that \r\n  Ronald was not acting as an agent or instrumentality of the State when he searched \r\n  Douglasâ€™s river house.Â  It is clear that, in visiting the river house to retrieve \r\n  personal property, Ronald undertook searching his motherâ€™s house of his own \r\n  accord.\r\nBased upon both the totality of the circumstances \r\n  and the Cohen factors, Ronaldâ€™s searches of the river house were not \r\n  State-endorsed and, thus, not barred by the Fourth Amendment.Â  Therefore, the \r\n  trial judge did not err in admitting items seized by Ronald from the river house. \r\n\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Items \r\n  Found in the Creek [6] \r\nDouglas argues the trial judge erred in refusing \r\n  to suppress the items found in the creek near her river house.Â  She asserts \r\n  the State failed to present any evidence connecting her to these items.Â  As \r\n  such, she contends the items were not relevant.\r\nPolice were informed a plastic bag containing several \r\n  items was found in a local creek approximately eighteen months after Ronnieâ€™s \r\n  murder.Â  After finding the bag wedged against their dock, the homeowners opened \r\n  the bag to discover it was weighted down with a brick and some rocks and contained \r\n  a second bag.Â  The inner bag contained the following:Â  surgical gloves, two \r\n  shirts, and a pair of jeans.Â  As previously discussed, several of these items \r\n  were identified as either Douglasâ€™s, or similar to an item owned by Douglas.Â  \r\n  After securing this identification, police divers went to the creek and found \r\n  a sunken cinder block, with the murder weapon and Ronnieâ€™s wallet stuffed into \r\n  the blockâ€™s holes.Â  \r\nWe find this evidence was relevant and properly \r\n  admitted by the trial judge.Â  The plastic bag and the cinder block were located \r\n  in the same vicinity in the creek.Â  Further, the creek was located in the same \r\n  area as Douglasâ€™s river house.Â  Though this evidence was circumstantial, it \r\n  was substantial in nature.Â  As Douglasâ€™s shirt was found in the vicinity of \r\n  the murder weapon and the victimâ€™s wallet, the items found in the creek tended \r\n  to increase the probability that Douglas was involved in Ronnieâ€™s murder.Â  Thus, \r\n  this evidence was clearly relevant.Â  See Rule 401, SCRE (stating relevant \r\n  evidence is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact \r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less \r\n  probable than it would be without the evidenceâ€).Â Â  Accordingly, the trial judge \r\n  did not err in admitting into evidence the items found in the creek near Douglasâ€™s \r\n  river house.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed verdict\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Murder\r\nDouglas argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying her motion for a directed verdict as to the murder charge.Â  She asserts \r\n  that, as the Stateâ€™s case was entirely circumstantial in nature, there was insufficient \r\n  evidence to convict her of murder. \r\nOn an appeal from the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court may only reverse \r\n  the trial judge if there is no evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\n  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002). Â When ruling \r\n  on a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal case, the trial judge is concerned \r\n  with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. \r\n  Morgan, 282 S.C. 409, 411, 319 S.E.2d 335, 336 (1984).Â  In reviewing the \r\n  denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence is viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 270, 531 \r\n  S.E.2d 512, 514 (2000).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find \r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 \r\n  S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  â€œA defendant is entitled \r\n  to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense \r\n  charged.â€Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).\r\nâ€œâ€˜Murderâ€™ is the killing of any person with malice \r\n  aforethought, either express or implied.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003).Â  \r\n  â€œâ€˜Maliceâ€™ is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or \r\n  depraved spirit intent on doing wrong.â€Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, \r\n  62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998).\r\nWe find the State presented substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence sufficient to allow Douglasâ€™s murder charge to go to \r\n  the jury.Â  While the town house appeared to be ransacked, there was no evidence \r\n  of forced entry.Â  Aside from Ronnie, Douglas had the only other set of keys \r\n  to the town house.Â  Further, Douglas was the last person to see Ronnie alive, \r\n  and she was the person who discovered his body before 7:00 a.m. the next morning.Â  \r\n  Douglas told police she arrived at the town house at such an early hour because \r\n  she wanted to go hunting with Ronnie.Â  However, Ronnieâ€™s brother testified that \r\n  Ronnie was not going hunting that morning because the two of them were going \r\n  to a car sale that day.Â  Douglas contradicted her own statement that she and \r\n  Ronnie were going hunting, as she told her paramour, Jay Webster, that she planned \r\n  on working in the yard at the river house that day.Â  Webster also testified \r\n  that Douglas came to his house the night before Ronnieâ€™s murder and told him \r\n  Ronnie wanted to get a divorce.Â  Douglas repeatedly lied to police about her \r\n  relationship with Webster before finally admitting they were having an extramarital \r\n  affair.Â  \r\nDouglasâ€™s two sons each testified that Ronnie had \r\n  purchased a .25-caliber pistol for Douglasâ€™s use.Â  While Douglas told police \r\n  the couple owned a .357 Magnum revolver and a .22 derringer, she did not initially \r\n  mention the .25-caliber pistol.Â  A .25-caliber pistol, along with Ronnieâ€™s wallet, \r\n  was recovered from the bottom of the creek and subsequently identified as the \r\n  murder weapon.Â  A plastic bag containing surgical gloves, two shirts, and a \r\n  pair of jeans was also recovered from the creek.Â  One of Douglasâ€™s daughters-in-law \r\n  identified one of the shirts as Douglasâ€™s and stated the jeans were Douglasâ€™s \r\n  size.Â  The daughter-in-law also stated the surgical gloves were similar to those \r\n  used in Douglasâ€™s beauty parlor. \r\nIn sum, the evidence presented at trial constituted \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tended to prove Douglasâ€™s \r\n  guilt.Â  Thus, the trial judge did not err in denying the motion for a directed \r\n  verdict as to the murder charge.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Armed Robbery\r\nDouglas argues the trial judge erred in denying her \r\n  motion for a directed verdict as to the armed robbery charge.Â  She asserts the \r\n  State failed to prove the required elements of armed robbery.Â  Specifically, \r\n  she contends there was no evidence that the perpetrator took the wallet by force \r\n  or intimidation or that the victim was alive at the time of the taking.Â  She \r\n  further asserts there was no evidence that the taking of the wallet and the \r\n  shooting occurred at the same time by the same person. Â \r\nâ€œRobbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful \r\n  taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person \r\n  of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Parker, 351 S.C. 567, 570, 571 S.E.2d 288, 289 (2002).Â  â€œArmed \r\n  robbery occurs when a person commits robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 570, 571 S.E.2d at 290; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (2003).Â  \r\n  More specifically, â€œ[r]obbery is the crime of larceny accomplished with force, \r\n  while larceny is the â€˜felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of anotherâ€™ \r\n  against the ownerâ€™s will or without his consent.Â  Thus, asportation is an element \r\n  of robbery and armed robbery.â€Â  State v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 598, 325 \r\n  S.E.2d 325, 325-26 (1985) (quoting State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 49, 260 \r\n  S.E.2d 719, 720 (1979)) (citations omitted).\r\nÂ  While there is no evidence the wallet was taken \r\n  before Ronnieâ€™s death, it is not essential the victim in an armed robbery must \r\n  be alive when the robbery occurs.Â  However, in order to be guilty of armed robbery \r\n  in conjunction with a homicide, the State must prove the victimâ€™s death and \r\n  the taking are part of a continuous chain of events so interconnected as to \r\n  be inseparable.Â  See 67 Am. Jur. 2d Robbery Â§ 14 (2003) (â€œ[A] \r\n  taking from the body of one already dead is a taking â€˜from the personâ€™ if the \r\n  death and the taking are so connected as to form a continuous chain of events.â€); \r\n  77 C.J.S. Robbery Â§ 9 (1994) (â€œAlthough, as an abstract principle of \r\n  law, one ordinarily cannot be guilty of robbery if the victim is a deceased \r\n  person, this principle does not apply where a robbery and homicide are a part \r\n  of the same transaction and are so interwoven with each other as to be inseparable.Â  \r\n  If the taking was made possible by an antecedent assault, the offense is robbery \r\n  regardless of whether the victim died before or after the taking of the property.â€); \r\n  see, e.g., Jones v. State, 652 So. 2d 346, 350 (Fla. 1995), cert. \r\n  denied, Jones v. Florida, 516 U.S. 875 (1995) (finding violent murders \r\n  and taking of victimsâ€™ property were part of continuous acts and therefore supported \r\n  robbery convictions); Oglesby v. State, 256 S.E.2d 371, 374 (Ga. 1979) \r\n  (affirming trial judgeâ€™s denial of directed verdict for armed robbery where \r\n  defendant contended the taking of the victimâ€™s property did not occur until \r\n  after the victim either was comatose or dead); State v.

Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) \r\n  (finding in a death penalty case that murders were committed â€œwhile in the commission \r\n  ofâ€ armed robbery or larceny with the use of a deadly weapon where property \r\n  belonging to the deceased individuals was stolen in a continuous sequence of \r\n  criminal acts at the time of the murders).\r\nWe find the State presented sufficient evidence to \r\n  support the armed robbery charge.Â  Ronnie was shot five times in the head.Â  \r\n  His house appeared to be ransacked and his wallet was missing.Â  The wallet was \r\n  found in the bottom of the creek with the murder weapon and in the same vicinity \r\n  as the items identified as belonging to Douglas.Â  Furthermore, given the violent \r\n  nature of Ronnieâ€™s death, it could be inferred that the force used to commit \r\n  the homicide also facilitated the taking.Â  Thus, there is substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence that Ronnieâ€™s murder and the taking of the property were part of a \r\n  single transaction or continuous sequence of events.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to \r\n  the State, as we are required to do, the evidence reasonably tends to prove \r\n  Douglasâ€™s guilt.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge properly submitted the armed \r\n  robbery charge to the jury. \r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sentencing\r\nDouglas argues the trial judge erred in levying \r\n  the sentence of life imprisonment for her murder conviction.Â  She states the \r\n  trial judge made an incorrect statement of law when discussing sentencing options. \r\n\r\nDuring sentencing the trial judge stated, â€œthe \r\n  sentence of the Court with regard to murder, and I will tell the open courtroom \r\n  there is [sic] only two choices.Â  Itâ€™s either thirty years or life, period.â€Â  \r\n  While Douglas argues this phrasing omits the option of levying a sentence of \r\n  less than thirty years imprisonment, there was no contemporaneous objection \r\n  at trial.Â  As such, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See \r\n  State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 424 (1999) (holding \r\n  an objection to a sentence exceeding the maximum allowable by law does not raise \r\n  a question of subject matter jurisdiction and cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal); State v.

(dissenting in part \r\n  and concurring in part):Â  I respectfully dissent from that portion of Judge \r\n  Curetonâ€™s opinion that holds the admission of insurance agent Gary Wayne Walkerâ€™s \r\n  testimony of his discussion with the defendant about her obtaining a quote on \r\n  life insurance for her husband constituted reversible error.Â  I also dissent \r\n  from that portion of Judge Curetonâ€™s opinion that reverses the defendantâ€™s convictions \r\n  for murder and for armed robbery because of the admission of this evidence.Â  \r\n  In view of the other evidence against the defendant, I regard any error in the \r\n  admission of the evidence of an inquiry about an insurance quote as â€œharmless \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  See State v. Tench, 353 S.C. 531, \r\n  536, 579 S.E.2d 314, 317 (2003) (admission of challenged evidence deemed harmless).Â  \r\n  Moreover, I simply fail to see how her inquiring about the purchase of insurance \r\n  on her husband proves anything, particularly when the evidence does not show \r\n  the defendant actually bought the insurance or otherwise benefited from it.\r\nI otherwise concur in Judge Curetonâ€™s opinion and would affirm the \r\n  defendantâ€™s sentences and convictions. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  It was subsequently determined by the medical examiner that Ronnie \r\n    had sustained five gunshot wounds to the head. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Miranda v.

Elizabeth Brosnan and David \r\n  A. Anderson, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn K. Koon and M. Catherine Smith, both of Winnsboro, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: After his newly purchased modular \r\n  home was damaged during a delivery accident, Respondent William Cline brought \r\n  suit against Appellant Modular Home Sets, Inc., as well as other defendants.Â  \r\n  The jury awarded Cline actual and punitive damages.Â  Modular Home appeals, arguing \r\n  the trial court erred by failing to dismiss Clineâ€™s action as barred by the \r\n  statute of limitations.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 7, 1997, Cline purchased a modular \r\n  home from J.E. Faulkner Homes, a modular home dealer in Rock Hill, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Setup of the home required it be delivered in two sections, both of which would \r\n  be raised by crane and set upon a preexisting foundation at the delivery site.Â  \r\n  To facilitate the on-site placement, Faulkner Homes contracted with Modular \r\n  Home to take responsibility for rigging the home.Â  Anthony Crane Rental supplied \r\n  the crane for the job.Â  \r\nOn September 8, 1997, Faulkner Homes delivered \r\n  the two sections of the home to the site.Â  Clayburn â€œRedâ€ Barnette, the president \r\n  and sole officer of Modular Home, positioned the cables around the first section \r\n  of the home, which was lifted and set into place on the foundation.Â  Barnett \r\n  then rigged the remaining section.Â  When the crane began to lift the second \r\n  sectionâ€”the heavier of the two because it contained all of the homeâ€™s plumbing \r\n  fixturesâ€”one of the rigging cables cut through a structural beam in the home.Â  \r\n  Cline was at the site at the time and saw the damage occur.Â  \r\nAs a result of the accident, Cline initiated \r\n  a negligence action against Faulkner Homes, Mascot Homes Sales Center, Stan \r\n  Taylor Insurance Agency, and Anthony Crane Rental on December 3, 1999.Â  Notably, \r\n  Cline did not name either Barnette or Modular Home as a defendant.Â  Cline amended \r\n  his complaint in May 2000 and again in June 2000, both times changing the named \r\n  defendants, but on neither occasion adding Barnette or Modular Home.Â  \r\nAccording to Cline, he first learned that Barnette \r\n  was not an employee of Faulkner Homes when he received interrogatory answers \r\n  from Faulkner Homes on November 7, 2000.Â  Even with this revelation in hand, \r\n  Cline did not amend his complaint to include Barnette until August 14, 2001.Â  \r\n  Cline once again amended his complaint on December 6, 2001, naming Modular Home \r\n  as a defendant.Â  When Cline finally served Modular Home with the Second Amended \r\n  Complaint on December 14, 2001, over four years had passed since the accident.\r\nIn its answer to Clineâ€™s complaint, Modular \r\n  Home asserted the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and also \r\n  moved for summary judgment on the same grounds at the start of trial.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied the motion and the matter proceeded to the merits.Â  Again on the \r\n  grounds that the statute of limitations had expired, Modular Home moved for \r\n  a directed verdict at the close of Clineâ€™s case.Â  The court denied the motion.Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict against both \r\n  Modular Home and Faulkner Homes, awarding $75,000.00 actual damages [1]  and $25,000.00 punitive damages \r\n  against the former, and $25,000.00 actual and $15,000.00 punitive against the \r\n  latter.Â  Modular Home appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nStatute of Limitations\r\nModular Home argues the trial court erred \r\n  in determining Clineâ€™s negligence action against it was not barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 15-3-530 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) sets forth a three-year statute of limitations for negligence \r\n  actions.Â  Under the discovery rule, the statutory period begins to run from \r\n  the date when the injury resulting from the wrongful conduct either is discovered \r\n  or may be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.Â  Smith v. Smith, \r\n  291 S.C. 420, 426, 354 S.E.2d 36, 40 (1987).Â  Under this objective test, one \r\n  is charged with discovery when the facts and circumstances of an injury would \r\n  put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some claim might \r\n  exist.Â  Austin v. Conway Hosp., Inc., 292 S.C. 334, 339, 356 S.E.2d 153, \r\n  156 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nThe parties agree that the accident occurred \r\n  on September 8, 1997, and that Cline was present and knew of the incident on \r\n  that date.Â  To avoid the statute of limitations, Cline argues he did not know \r\n  Modular Home was an independent contractor until November 2000 when he received \r\n  answers to Clineâ€™s interrogatories. [2] Â  However, under South Carolina law, the date \r\n  when a plaintiff learns of a potential new defendant has absolutely no bearing \r\n  on the timing of the statute of limitations.Â  Such was the explicit holding \r\n  of our supreme court in Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 128, 442 S.E.2d \r\n  169, 170 (1994):\r\n\r\n[T]he focus is upon the date of discovery of the injury, not \r\n  the date of discovery of the wrongdoer:Â  The important date under the discovery \r\n  rule is the date that a plaintiff discovers the injury, not the date of the \r\n  discovery of the identity of another alleged wrongdoer. If, on the date of injury, \r\n  a plaintiff knows or should know that she had some claim against someone else, \r\n  the statute of limitations begins to run for all claims based on that injury.\r\n\r\nHere, the statute of limitations began to run in \r\n  September of 1997, when Cline discovered his home was damaged.Â  Because three \r\n  years had expired by the time Cline named Modular Home as a defendant, his negligence \r\n  claim against Modular Home was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the trial court erred in failing to grant Modular Homeâ€™s motions for \r\n  directed verdict. [3] Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Because the juryâ€™s \r\n    cumulative actual damages award exceeded the established maximum value of \r\n    the home, the trial judge reduced this amount to $50,000.00.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Cline also argues that his addition of Modular Home should relate \r\n    back to his original pleading under Rule 15(c), SCRCP.Â  However, relation \r\n    back applies only when an existing party is changed, not when a new party \r\n    is added to a complaint.Â  See Jackson v. Doe, 342 S.C. 552, \r\n    558, 537 S.E.2d 567, 570 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe language of Rule 15(c) clearly \r\n    speaks to a change in party, not the addition of a defendant \r\n    to an already existing defendant.â€ (emphasis in original)). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  Because we find the statute of limitations has run, we need not \r\n    address Modular Homeâ€™s other argument on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3799","title":"Burnell v.

Small, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nJennifer Lee North, of Sullivan's Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: The family court found Michelle \r\n  Burnell (Mother) in contempt of court for violating the terms of its previous \r\n  order awarding her and John Burnell (Father) joint custody of their minor child.Â  \r\n  Mother appeals.Â  WeÂ  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father married in 1994 and had a son, \r\n  born March 12, 1997.Â  On February 24, 2000, Mother filed for divorce on the \r\n  grounds of â€œhabitual drunkenness, physical cruelty, and/or adultery.â€Â  The family \r\n  court scheduled a hearing on the issues of divorce, property settlement, and \r\n  custody for May 9, 2001.Â  Immediately prior to the hearing, the parties informed \r\n  the family court that they had reached an agreement on all outstanding issues \r\n  through mediation, though the agreement had not yet been reduced to writing.Â  \r\n  As a consequence, the bulk of the hearing consisted of the mediator, Susan Dunn, \r\n  reciting the agreementâ€™s terms followed by judicial inquiries directed at each \r\n  party to assure the agreement had been validly entered into.Â  Of particular \r\n  importance to this dispute is the following description as to how the parties \r\n  were to make decisions affecting their minor child:Â  \r\n\r\nThe parties have also agreed that all major decisions concerning \r\n  the childâ€™s life will deserve a good faith effort to reach a mutual decision.Â  \r\n  That major decisions [sic] shall include, but not be limited to choice of schools, \r\n  non-emergency medical and dental treatment, sports team commitments.Â  Both parents \r\n  shall have free access to the child at day-care and school.Â  Both will provide \r\n  the other with current address and telephone numbers and the parentâ€”either parent \r\n  when traveling with or without the child will provide the other with contact \r\n  information so they could be reached if they were needed.\r\n\r\nWith the agreement on the record, the family court \r\n  granted a divorce based on one year of separation without cohabitation and awarded \r\n  the parties joint custody of their minor child.Â  A final written order, containing \r\n  slightly different requirements, was filed on July 31, 2001.Â  \r\nBy letter dated June 16, 2001, Mother informed \r\n  Father that their child would be moving from the La Petite daycare facility \r\n  in West Ashley to the La Petite daycare in Ashley Phosphate.Â  The new location \r\n  was more convenient to Fatherâ€™s workplace and Motherâ€™s home.Â  Father did not \r\n  respond to this letter, and Mother transferred the child on July 10, 2001.Â  \r\n  However, Father refused to pick the child up from the Ashley Phosphate location \r\n  because he believed Motherâ€™s decision to change the location of their childâ€™s \r\n  daycare violated the family courtâ€™s order.Â  Father also refused to discuss the \r\n  matter with Mother, and on August 6, 2001, Mother returned the child to the \r\n  West Ashley location in order to ensure that their child would not be deprived \r\n  of seeing Father.Â  \r\nFather also accused Mother of violating the court \r\n  order on May 20, 2001, when she completed an application for the child to be \r\n  enrolled at the Garrett Academy Child Development Center for the following school \r\n  year.Â  Father complains that Mother did not inform him of this application until \r\n  August 14, 2001, two days before school was to begin.Â  \r\nFather further argued that Mother violated the \r\n  court order when she took their child to his annual physical examination and \r\n  his first dentist appointment without conferring with him, though Mother contended \r\n  the appointments had been scheduled prior to the May 9, 2001 hearing.Â  Finally, \r\n  Father argued Mother violated the order by not keeping him informed of her address \r\n  and by traveling to Baltimore, Maryland for a week in July without informing \r\n  him of the trip.\r\nCiting the above violations, Father filed a rule \r\n  to show cause on August 15, 2001.Â  The court found Mother in contempt of the \r\n  oral and written orders.Â  Specifically, the court found Mother had failed to \r\n  keep Father informed of the childâ€™s whereabouts, failed to consult with Father \r\n  in making educational decisions, failed to inform Father of vacation plans out \r\n  of state, and failed to adequately inform Father regarding medical and dental \r\n  appointments.Â  For these violations, the court ordered Mother to serve one-year \r\n  confinement or to pay $2,000.00 of Fatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this \r\n  court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, a finding of contempt should \r\n  not be reversed on appeal unless it is without evidentiary support or amounts \r\n  to an abuse of discretion.Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 369 \r\n  S.E.2d 840 (1988).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother contends the family court erred \r\n  in finding her in contempt because her ostensibly contemptuous conduct occurred \r\n  before the written order was entered into and her behavior did not violate the \r\n  mandates of the oral order.Â  We agree.\r\nIn a proceeding for contempt, the moving party \r\n  must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing noncompliance \r\n  with the order.Â  Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 41, 545 S.E.2d 830, 831 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â Â  Before a party may be found in contempt, the record must \r\n  clearly and specifically show the contemptuous conduct.Â  State v. Bevilacqua, \r\n  316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\nIn the present case, the oral order required the \r\n  parties to make a good faith effort to reach a mutual decision on all major \r\n  decisions concerning the childâ€™s life, including choice of schools and non-emergency \r\n  medical or dental treatment.Â  The evidence on the record shows that Mother sent \r\n  Father a letter before changing the location of their childâ€™s daycare.Â  When \r\n  Father did not respond to the letter after three weeks, Mother brought the child \r\n  to the new location.Â  While this unilateral action may have violated the later \r\n  written order, which requires the parties to consult and agree on all major \r\n  decisions, her behavior did not violate the oral order because she made a good \r\n  faith effort to consult with Father.Â  Furthermore, by merely filling out an \r\n  application to enroll their child in four-year-old kindergarten at Garrett Academy, \r\n  Mother did not violate the courtâ€™s order because she had not yet made any decision \r\n  on behalf of the child.Â  Although the written order had been entered into requiring \r\n  the parties to actually agree on all choice-of-school decisions by the time \r\n  Mother informed Father of the Garrett Academy application, Father filed this \r\n  contempt action before the child ever changed schools.\r\nNext, Father argues that Mother failed to provide \r\n  him with contact information when she and the child traveled to Baltimore in \r\n  July.Â  According to the oral order, when the parties traveled out of town, they \r\n  were required to â€œprovide the other with contact information so they could be \r\n  reached if they were needed.â€ [1] Â  Although Mother did not give Father the address \r\n  of where she was staying, Father did have Motherâ€™s cell phone number, which \r\n  would have enabled him to contact her if she or the child were needed.Â  \r\nFather also argues Mother violated the court order \r\n  by failing to inform him of their childâ€™s annual doctorâ€™s appointment and his \r\n  first dental appointment.Â  However, the oral order only required the parties \r\n  to make mutual decisions on all medical or dental treatment.Â  Because \r\n  the order was unclear whether the parties needed to consult each other for routine \r\n  medical or dental check-ups, Motherâ€™s failure to inform Father of these \r\n  appointments does not amount to a willful violation of the court order.Â  See \r\n  Welchel v. Boyter, 260 S.C. 418, 421, 196 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1973) (â€œOne \r\n  may not be convicted of contempt for violating a court order which fails to \r\n  tell him in definite terms what he must do and the language of the commands \r\n  must be clear and certain rather than implied.â€).\r\nFinally, Father argues Mother failed to keep him \r\n  informed of her home address.Â  In its order finding Mother in contempt, the \r\n  family court found as a fact that:\r\n\r\n[Mother] failed to inform [Father] of her address and phone \r\n  number.Â  Documentary evidence admitted into the record by both parties reflects \r\n  that the Garrett Academy application and the La Peitite application completed \r\n  on June 20, 2001, contain the North Charleston address at which [Mother] presently \r\n  resides.Â  . . . [Mother] testified that she did not advise [Father] that she \r\n  had moved or give him her North Charleston address until July 10, 2001.Â  She \r\n  had been living there for approximately two weeks at that time. \r\n\r\nMother testified that although she had planned to move to \r\n  her North Charleston mobile home before the month of July, she did not actually \r\n  move there until July 9, the day before she gave Father her new address.Â  Corroborating \r\n  her testimony, Mother submitted to the court the contract she signed for the \r\n  mobile home, which was dated July 9, 2001. Thus, despite the fact that Mother \r\n  wrote the North Charleston address on the childâ€™s school applications in June, \r\n  there is no evidence in the record to support the family courtâ€™s finding that \r\n  Mother had moved into the mobile home by June 20, 2001 and then waited two weeks \r\n  before telling Father about her move.Â  Rather, the evidence indicates Mother \r\n  did not move until July 9.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the family court \r\n  order finding Mother in contempt. \r\n  [2] \r\n REVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The written order required the parent in custody of the child to \r\n    notify the other of the childâ€™s general whereabouts; however, Mother traveled \r\n    to Baltimore with the child before the written order was filed.Â  The oral \r\n    order did not contain this requirement.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Because we reverse the family court order finding Mother in contempt, \r\n    we need not address Motherâ€™s other arguments on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3800","title":"Beard v.

Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3800\r\nHeard March 11, 2004 â€“ Filed May 24, \r\n  2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nT. Alexander Beard, of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nA. Camden Lewis, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.: Attorney T. Alexander Beard \r\n  appeals an order of the trial court denying his motion for sanctions brought \r\n  under the Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act (â€œthe FCPSAâ€), S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-36-10, et seq. (Supp. 2003) and Rule 11, SCRCP. \r\n  The trial court found that Beardâ€™s motion was time barred under the FCPSA and \r\n  that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.Â  Alternatively, \r\n  the trial court allowed the motion under Rule 11 and found that the actions \r\n  at issue were done in good faith and did not constitute sanctionable behavior.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe initial dispute resulting in this \r\n  action arose over the operation and ownership of two limited liability companies.Â  \r\n  Keith Watkins worked for a substantial period of time for John Newsome, Jr., \r\n  a car dealership owner. Due to various federal tax problems, Newsome was unable \r\n  to retain sole ownership of four car dealership franchises.Â  Newsome attempted \r\n  to transfer their ownership to his wife and son, but the manufacturers rejected \r\n  that attempt because his wife and son were not acceptable as car dealers. Newsome \r\n  then suggested Watkins. The manufacturers accepted Watkins because of his experience \r\n  in the field. \r\nIn 1996, Newsome transferred the \r\n  four dealerships to two newly formed L.L.C.s, Imports of Florence and Newsome \r\n  Automotive. As required by the manufacturers, Watkins was made â€œdealer-operatorâ€ \r\n  of both companies and given a 15% ownership interest in each. The L.L.C. operating \r\n  agreements (â€œthe original agreementsâ€) called for contributions from Watkins \r\n  of $40,050 and $13,418. Beard did not represent any of the parties in connection \r\n  with the original agreements. \r\nIn 1997, the parties apparently \r\n  reached a new agreement and NewsomeÂ  decided to memorialize that new agreement. \r\n  Beard drafted the new L.L.C. agreements (â€œthe new agreementsâ€). The new agreements \r\n  reflected that Watkins had a 15% voting interest and a 1% interest in profits \r\n  and losses. The new agreements also gave the L.L.C.s the right to redeem Watkinsâ€™s \r\n  interests for $1,000 each. In February 1998, all of the changes were underlined \r\n  in red and sent to the parties for their signature. Accompanying the new agreements \r\n  was a letter from Beard which included the following explanation:\r\n\r\nEveryone needs to know and understand that I am representing \r\n  you [Newsome] and your interests and not the interests of the LLC members.Â  \r\n  My limited information indicates that everyone is in agreement with whatever \r\n  you want to do. To avoid any conflicts of interest or possible misunderstandings, \r\n  I strongly suggest, by copy of this letter, that the LLC members have their \r\n  own professionals review these materials.\r\n\r\nWatkins understood that Beard was never his personal \r\n  attorney and was not representing his interest in this matter. He contacted \r\n  a local attorney about the new agreements, but that attorney had a conflict \r\n  of interest. Watkins then contacted a second attorney, who recommended a third \r\n  local attorney and sent the new agreements to his office. That third attorney \r\n  in fact represented Watkins in the 1998 transactions. Watkins signed the redrafted \r\n  L.L.C. operating agreements in April 1998. \r\nEight months later, Watkins was notified \r\n  that the L.L.C.s were exercising the option to purchase his interests. Watkins \r\n  consulted his attorney. He then signed both assignment and indemnity agreements \r\n  and cashed both $1,000 checks. Soon after the buy-back from Watkins, Newsome \r\n  entered into an asset purchase agreement with Sonic Automotive, Inc. for the \r\n  purchase of several dealerships owned by the Newsome family, including those \r\n  owned by the two L.L.C.s at issue.Â  Watkins demanded $250,000 consideration \r\n  to consent to the purchase. Sonic and Newsome determined that Watkins had no \r\n  interest in the dealerships and that they did not need his authorization or \r\n  consent to go forward with the sale. The sale was closed in May 1999. Watkins \r\n  filed suit in January 2000 against Newsome and the L.L.C.s, claiming, among \r\n  other things, fraud and unfair trade practices. Beard represented the defendants \r\n  in that matter. \r\nIn January 2001, Watkinsâ€™s attorneys, \r\n  Richard J. Breibart and Richard A. Harpootlian, filed a motion to amend the \r\n  complaint, attempting to name Beard as a defendant. The amended complaint alleged \r\n  malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Beard. Those allegations \r\n  were supported by an expertâ€™s affidavit from Professor Gregory B. Adams of the \r\n  University of South Carolina School of Law. He opined that a special relationship \r\n  and confidence existed between Beard and Watkins, creating an attorney-client \r\n  relationship. Professor Adams also concluded that Beard had breached that relationship. \r\n  The trial court denied the motion to amend the complaint on February 6, 2001. \r\n  In August 2001, the parties reached a settlement and the action was dismissed \r\n  with prejudice.Â  \r\nOn February 4, 2002, Beard filed a motion seeking \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the FCPSA [1] \r\n   and Rule 11, SCRCP. He also filed a motion to enlarge the ten-day limitation \r\n  for filing under the FCPSA since that time had expired. Beard claimed that the \r\n  attempt to name him as a party defendant was for improper purposes and that \r\n  Breibart and Harpootlian did not reasonably believe the facts upon which the \r\n  claim was based. Beard alleged that Breibart and Harpootlian admitted that they \r\n  moved to amend their complaint â€œbecause [they] believed they could get more \r\n  from Beard in a deposition if he were a party and to â€˜drive a wedgeâ€™ between \r\n  Beard and his client.â€Â  \r\nIn September 2002, the trial court issued an order \r\n  denying Beardâ€™s motions on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction to \r\n  grant the requested relief after ten days under the FCPSA. Alternatively, the \r\n  court ruled that the attorneys had acted in good faith and therefore Rule 11 \r\n  sanctions were unwarranted. This appeal followed.\r\n \r\n  ISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in applying the ten-day limitation for a motion brought \r\n  under the Frivolous Proceedings Act?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in not ruling on Appellantâ€™s motion for enlargement \r\n  of time under Rule 6?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in finding that the claims against Appellant were made \r\n  to secure a proper purpose?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in finding that Respondentâ€™s attorneys acted in good \r\n  faith?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the trial court err in not considering the issue of anÂ  attorneyâ€™s immunity \r\n  vis-a-vis a third party?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for attorneysâ€™ fees is one in \r\n  equity.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1997).Â  \r\n  In an action in equity tried by a judge alone, the appellate court has jurisdiction \r\n  to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Id.; see also Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). However, following the determination \r\n  of facts, an appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing \r\n  the decision to award sanctions and the specific sanctions awarded. Father \r\n  v. SCDSS, 353 S.C. 254, 261, 578 S.E.2d 11, 14 (2003).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI &amp; II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act\r\n\r\nBeard argues that his motion is \r\n  permissible under the FCPSA since the FCPSA does not specify a statute of limitation. \r\n  However, Watkins contends that the general ten-day limitation for post-trial \r\n  motions applies here and bars the action. We agree with Watkins.\r\nThis Court addressed the timing of post-trial \r\n  motions for sanctions in Pitman v. Republic Leasing Co., 351 S.C. 429, \r\n  570 S.E.2d 187 (Ct. App. 2002). In that case, the defendant moved for sanctions \r\n  two months after summary judgment had been granted in his favor. The Court vacated \r\n  the award of attorneysâ€™ fees. It held that a trial court cannot entertain a \r\n  motion for sanctions under the FCPSA where that motion was filed more than ten \r\n  days after the judgment. Pitman analogized a motion under the FCPSA to post-trial \r\n  motions under Rules 59(d) and (e), SCRCP, which provide: â€œ[n]ot later than 10 \r\n  days after entry of judgment, the court of its own initiative may order a new \r\n  trial for any reason . . . â€; andÂ  â€œ[a] motion to alter or amend the judgment \r\n  shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the \r\n  entry of the order.â€ \r\nBeard maintains that those are merely \r\n  rules of limitation and do not affect the jurisdiction of the court. Additionally, \r\n  Beard argues that the proper time limit in this case is three years, since this \r\n  is an action for a penalty upon a statute. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-540 \r\n  (1976). In essence, Beard mounts a direct challenge to Pitman and asks \r\n  us to overrule that decision. \r\nWe agree that the rules limiting post \r\n  trial motions are rules of limitation, not of jurisdiction. See Standard \r\n  Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Mungo, 306 S.C. 22, 26 n.1, 410 S.E.2d 18, \r\n  20 n.1 (Ct. App. 1991) (â€œThe ten day requirement of Rule [59] is, however, a \r\n  rule of limitation, not a rule of jurisdictionâ€¦ [and] does not affect the jurisdiction \r\n  of the court.â€). However, the argument that these are rules of limitation cannot \r\n  be used to defeat the jurisdictional limit of trial courts.Â  See Rule \r\n  82(a), SCRCP, (â€œThese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction \r\n  of any court of this State . . . .â€). The established case law is that a trial \r\n  judge loses jurisdiction over a case when the time to file post-trial motions \r\n  has elapsed. Pitman, 351 S.C. at 432, 570 S.E.2d at 189; Ness v. Eckerd \r\n  Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 402, 566 S.E.2d 193, 195 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œAlthough \r\n  trial judges retain jurisdiction to alter judgments on their own initiative \r\n  for ten days if a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion is filed, after ten days that jurisdiction \r\n  is lost.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhile the general time limit for an action upon \r\n  a statute is three years, that limit does not apply if â€œthe statute imposing \r\n  [the action] prescribes a different limitation.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-540 (1976). \r\n  And the statute creating the action need not expressly provide a different limitation; \r\n  it can do so by plain implication.Â  See, e.g., Earle v. Owings, \r\n  72 S.C. 362, 365, 51 S.E. 980, 982 (1905). Beardâ€™s argument that a three-year \r\n  limitation period applies is therefore not persuasive. Under the FCPSA, â€œ[t]he \r\n  entitlement of the aggrieved person must be determined by the trial judge at \r\n  the conclusion of a trial upon motion of the aggrieved party. . . .â€ Â§ 15-36-30 \r\n  (emphasis added). This language clearly implies a time limitation for motions \r\n  under the FCPSA even though the FCPSA did not expressly establish one. We find \r\n  that the trial court was correct to dismiss Beardâ€™s motion as untimely. \r\nBeard next argues that the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to rule on his Rule 6 motion to extend the time to file for sanctions \r\n  under the FCPSA. The trial court, contrary to Beardâ€™s assertion, did rule on \r\n  the motion. In its October 30, 2002 order, the court clearly stated: â€œ[b]y implication, \r\n  the Court denied the Motion to enlarge the time as to the filing under provisions \r\n  of [the FCPSA] . . . .â€ Beard insists that Rule 6 permits a trial court to enlarge \r\n  the time for sanctions under the FCPSA. Assuming, arguendo, that Beard \r\n  is correct, such permission is, by its very language, at the discretion of the \r\n  trial judge: â€œthe court for cause shown may at any time \r\n  in its discretion . . . (2) upon motion made after the expiration of the specified \r\n  period, for good cause shown, permit the act to be done.â€ Rule 6(b), SCRCP, \r\n  (emphasis added). \r\nIn Pitman, the action was time barred even \r\n  though the delay was only two months. Here, Beard filed his motion almost one \r\n  full year after the trial court denied Watkinsâ€™s motion to amend his complaint \r\n  to include Beard as a defendant and nearly six months after the underlying case \r\n  was settled. The only â€œgood causeâ€ offered for the one-year delay is ignorance \r\n  as to the proper time limitation under the FCPSA. \r\n  [2]  While recognizing that the FCPSA may lack specificity, we find that \r\n  the phrase â€œat the conclusion of a trial upon motion by the aggrieved partyâ€ \r\n  plainly requires some degree of urgency on the part of an aggrieved party to \r\n  file a motion upon settlement or judgment of the underlying case. Without a \r\n  more specific showing of â€œgood causeâ€ for the delay by Beard, we cannot say \r\n  that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Beardâ€™s Rule 6(b) motion \r\n  for enlargement.\r\n\r\nIII &amp; IV.Â  Rule 11\r\n\r\nIts ruling concerning the FCPSA notwithstanding, the trial court allowed Beardâ€™s \r\n  motion seeking attorneysâ€™ fees and other costs against Watkins and his attorneys \r\n  under Rule 11, SCRCP. [3]  Thus, Beard advanced two arguments on the merit \r\n  of his motion. Beard first argued that the claims against him were not made \r\n  for a proper purpose. Beard also argued that Breibart and Harpootlian did not \r\n  act in good faith. The trial court ruled against Beard, reasoning that Breibart \r\n  and Harpootlian had good grounds for their motion. [4]  Beard maintains that the trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  was based on erroneous assumptions and therefore must be overturned. We disagree.\r\nAt the outset, we note that \r\n  Beard raises on appeal the proper purpose issue under the FCPSA, not under Rule \r\n  11. Though we have found that the trial court correctly dismissed Beardâ€™s motion \r\n  under the FCPSA as untimely, we address the merit of Beardâ€™s arguments since \r\n  the â€œcriteria for Rule 11 sanctions are essentially the same as those for sanctions \r\n  under the [FCPSA].â€ The Father v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., \r\n  345 S.C. 57, 72, 545 S.E.2d 523, 531 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nBreibart and Harpootlian based their decision to \r\n  sue Beard on an affidavit provided by their expert, Professor Adams, but Beard \r\n  asserts that Breibart and Harpootlian decided to â€œgive [Professor Adams] selected \r\n  facts and omit other facts.â€ Specifically, Beard contends that Professor Adams \r\n  was told that Beard had drafted the original L.L.C. agreement and that Watkins \r\n  â€œhad always relied on Mr. Beard as lawyer for the two LLCs.â€ However, in his \r\n  affidavit of April 2002, Professor Adams declared that he had reviewed Beardâ€™s \r\n  February 20, 1998 letter to Watkins, which, among other things, advised Watkins \r\n  to retain his own legal counsel. Based on that letter, Professor Adams concluded \r\n  that a fiduciary relationship existed between Beard and Watkins and that Beard \r\n  breached that duty. Professor Adams also stated that he talked to both Beard \r\n  and Beardâ€™s attorney, but neither was able to change his opinion. We need not \r\n  determine whether Professor Adamsâ€™s conclusion was correct â€“ and we do not do \r\n  so. It is sufficient that Breibart and Harpootlian relied on his expert opinion \r\n  in bringing the action against Beard.\r\n\r\nV.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Immunity\r\n\r\nBeard argues that the trial court should have ruled \r\n  that an attorneyâ€™s immunity concerning a third party precluded the motion to \r\n  add Beard as a party. The trial court refused to consider that issue at the \r\n  Rule 59(e) hearing because Beard had not raised it at the hearing for sanctions. \r\n  The record does not indicate, and Beard does not contend, that Beard argued \r\n  the immunity issue before the trial courtâ€™s ruling. Therefore, the issue was \r\n  not preserved. See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue \r\n  by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€); Barr \r\n  v. City of Rock Hill, 330 S.C. 640, 644, 500 S.E.2d 157, 159 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\n  (refusing to entertain an issue on appeal because it was not argued before the \r\n  trial court) (citing A. Lassberg &amp; Co. v. Atlantic Cotton Co., 291 \r\n  S.C. 161, 165, 352 S.E.2d 501, 503 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the trial \r\n  court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-36-10, et seq. \r\n    (Supp. 2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] At the conclusion of the underlying case, Pitman had yet to \r\n    be decided.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Rule 11, SCRCP, reads in part, â€œ[t]he signature of an attorney or \r\n    party constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion \r\n    or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief \r\n    there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay \r\n    . . . If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this \r\n    Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the \r\n    person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, \r\n    which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount \r\n    of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, \r\n    motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [4]  The trial courtâ€™s order speaks \r\n    of â€œgood groundâ€ while Beard frames the issue as one of â€œgood faithâ€ or â€œbad \r\n    faith.â€ That semantic difference is of no legal import since Rule 11 has been \r\n    interpreted to include actions done in bad faith. See Runyon v. \r\n    Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 19, 471 S.E.2d 160, 162 (1996) (â€œThe party and/or \r\n    attorney may also be sanctioned [under Rule 11] for filing a pleading, motion, \r\n    or other paper in bad faith . . .)

Honeycutt, of Fort Mill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Mary Elizabeth Dixon \r\n  Smith (â€œWifeâ€) filed an order and rule to show cause seeking to hold Hugh McIntyre \r\n  Smith (â€œHusbandâ€) in contempt for failing to pay alimony.Â  The trial judge declined \r\n  to hold Husband in contempt, finding Husband did not willfully disobey the court \r\n  order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife divorced on \r\n  January 19, 1998.Â  Their settlement agreement provided that Wife would receive \r\n  $3,000 per month in alimony.Â  However, the agreement acknowledged that Husband \r\n  was nearing retirement and that his retirement would constitute a change in \r\n  circumstances for the purpose of computing alimony.Â  Specifically, the order \r\n  stated:Â  â€œIn the event the Husband so retires, the parties acknowledge that \r\n  this shall constitute a change in circumstances and the Court shall review the \r\n  financial condition of the parties to determine what, if any, sum of alimony \r\n  will be appropriate thereafter.â€Â  The agreement also provided that Husband would \r\n  pay, after his retirement, a portion of his Social Security benefit each month \r\n  to Wife.Â  \r\nUpon his retirement in August \r\n  1999, Husband stopped paying the $3,000 per month in alimony and has not paid \r\n  any further alimony, except for a portion of what he receives in Social Security \r\n  benefits pursuant to the settlement agreement.Â  In addition, while the order \r\n  acknowledged Husbandâ€™s retirement would be a sufficient change of circumstances \r\n  to warrant review of his alimony obligation, no review had occurred, nor had \r\n  Husband filed an action for review by any court concerning the amount of alimony \r\n  he should be paying.Â  On November 20, 2001, Wife filed an order and rule to \r\n  show cause seeking to hold Husband in contempt for failing to pay alimony since \r\n  August 1999.Â  The trial judge found that because the language in the order requires \r\n  the courtâ€™s review of the financial condition of the parties upon Husbandâ€™s \r\n  retirement and does not specify which party should seek review, Husband was \r\n  not in contempt.Â  At the hearing, the judge stated: \r\n\r\nI find that because the language \r\n  within the Order is mandatory, that there is sufficient information or sufficient \r\n  doubt as to whether or not there was responsibility on either party, other than \r\n  what they both acknowledge was, in fact, the change of circumstances as anticipated \r\n  in the Order.Â \r\n\r\nThe Order says the Court â€œshallâ€ \r\n  review the financial condition of the parties.Â  What we have is a delay in that \r\n  review, obviously, but the language is mandatory that the review should take \r\n  place upon the retirement from his then place of employment that was anticipatory.Â  \r\n\r\nBased on his findings, the judge declined \r\n  to hold Husband in contempt and gave him ten days in which to file an appropriate \r\n  motion to seek modification of the alimony award.Â  The trial judge declined \r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees, but ruled the issue could be raised at the merits \r\n  hearing.Â  Wife appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA determination of contempt \r\n  lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, \r\n  Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 607, 567 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  â€œA determination of contempt is a serious matter and should be imposed sparingly; \r\n  whether it is or is not imposed is within the discretion of the trial judge, \r\n  which will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is without evidentiary support.â€Â \r\nHaselwood v. Sullivan, 283 S.C. 29, 32-33, 320 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contempt\r\nWife argues the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to find Husband in contempt of the order requiring him to pay $3,000 \r\n  per month in alimony.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is well settled that contempt results \r\n  from willful disobedience of a court order; and before a person may be held \r\n  in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct upon \r\n  which the contempt is based.â€Â  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc., 350 S.C. at \r\n  612, 567 S.E.2d at 522 (quoting State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, \r\n  447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  A willful act is â€œone done voluntarily \r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, \r\n  or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; \r\n  that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  Id. \r\n  (citations omitted).Â  \r\nTherefore, our focus is on whether the \r\n  trial judge abused his discretion in finding that Husband did not willfully \r\n  disobey the order requiring him to pay alimony.Â  We agree with the trial judge \r\n  that the mandatory language in the order stating, â€œIn the event the Husband \r\n  so retires, the parties acknowledge that this shall constitute a change \r\n  in circumstances and the Court shall review the financial condition of \r\n  the parties . . .â€ was ambiguous as to who was to initiate review of the financial \r\n  position of the parties.Â  Because the order did not specify which party was \r\n  responsible for bringing an action for review, we find the trial judge did not \r\n  abuse his discretion by declining to hold Husband in contempt for failing to \r\n  file an action for modification.\r\nWife also argues that a new action was \r\n  necessary to modify Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation and therefore the trial judge \r\n  erred in ordering Husband to merely file a motion seeking court review of his \r\n  finances. We disagree.Â  Section 20-3-170 of the South Carolina Code (1976 and \r\n  Supp. 2003) provides that â€œeither party may apply to the court which rendered \r\n  the judgment for an order and judgment decreasing or increasing the amount of \r\n  such alimony payments or terminating such payments . . . .â€Â  While filing a \r\n  new action for a modification may be preferable, section 20-3-170 does not mandate \r\n  this approach.Â  Moreover, Wife does not argue and we fail to discern any prejudice \r\n  by the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on this issue.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s FeesÂ  \r\nWife claims the trial judge erred in failing \r\n  to award her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, the trial judge did not grant or deny \r\n  Wifeâ€™s request for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in the contempt order; instead, \r\n  he deferred consideration of an award until the final hearing on the merits \r\n  of modification.Â  We find this issue is not immediately appealable.\r\nAn intermediate or interlocutory order is \r\n  immediately appealable only if it involves the merits of the case or affects \r\n  a substantial right.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 and Supp. 2003).Â  The \r\n  trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding Wifeâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees is not immediately \r\n  appealable because it does not involve the merits of the case nor does it affect \r\n  any of Wifeâ€™s substantial rights.Â Â  See Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 \r\n  S.C. 135, 138, 564 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œPursuant to section 14-3-330(2), \r\n  this Court may not review an order that â€˜does not prevent a judgment from being \r\n  rendered in the action, and [from which the] appellant can seek review . . . \r\n  in any appeal from [the] final judgment.â€™â€). Â Therefore, we do not reach this \r\n  issue.Â  See also Neville v. Neville, 278 S.C. 411, 411, \r\n  297 S.E.2d 423, 423 (1982) (â€œWe are of the opinion that the interests of justice \r\n  will be served best if appeals from pendente lite orders are held in \r\n  abeyance until the final order is entered in the family court.â€).\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial judge \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3802","title":"Roberson v.

Wilson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: &nbsp;The family\r\ncourt granted Sharon B. Roberson a divorce from Willie J. Roberson on the\r\ngrounds of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.&nbsp; On appeal, Husband challenges the equitable \r\n  division of a mobile home park and the marital home, the award of alimony, the \r\n  securing of the alimony, and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were \r\n  married in 1987.Â  Each party owned real property prior to the marriage.Â  Wifeâ€™s \r\n  home was used as the marital residence, and the parties made various improvements \r\n  to it during the marriage. Husband owned a mobile home park prior to the marriage, \r\n  and improvements were made to the park during the course of the marriage.Â  The \r\n  family court issued a divorce decree finding both properties were transmuted \r\n  into marital property and apportioned the home sixty-five percent to Wife and \r\n  thirty-five percent to Husband.Â  The family court apportioned the original mobile \r\n  home park sixty-five percent to Husband and thirty-five percent to Wife.Â  The \r\n  balance of the marital estate, including additional mobile homes purchased for \r\n  the park during the marriage, was divided sixty-three percent to Husband and \r\n  thirty-seven percent to Wife.Â  The Wife was granted possession of the marital \r\n  home, and Husband was ordered to assume the second mortgage and pay $41,460 \r\n  to Wife.Â  The remaining real and personal property, with the exception of a \r\n  few personal items, was granted to Husband.Â  The family court awarded Wife permanent \r\n  periodic alimony in the amount of $600 per month and required Husband to maintain \r\n  life insurance in the amount of $25,000 as security for the payment of alimony.Â  \r\n  Finally, the family court awarded Wife $8,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn appeal from an order of the family \r\n  court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 \r\n  S.C. 301, 304, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000) (citation omitted).Â  However, this \r\n  broad scope of review does not require us to ignore the findings of the family \r\n  court.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  â€œNeither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  (citation omitted). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division \r\n  of the Mobile Home Park and Marital Home  \r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  by assigning Wife a thirty-five percent interest in the original mobile home \r\n  park contending that Wifeâ€™s contribution to the park was minimal.Â  Further, \r\n  Husband asserts that his contribution to the improvement and appreciation of \r\n  the marital home should afford him a greater share of the home.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) sets forth the various equitable apportionment factors and \r\n  vests the family court with discretion to decide what weight to assign the factors.Â  \r\n  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  When reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment, â€œthis Court looks \r\n  to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  If the end result is equitable, \r\n  it is irrelevant that this Court might have weighed specific factors differently \r\n  than the trial judge.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson,&nbsp;296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 \r\n  S.E.2d 107, 113&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) (citations omitted).Â  The family courtâ€™s \r\n  apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 23, 553 S.E.2d 251, \r\n  255 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can \r\n  be determined that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently \r\n  for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€Â  Jenkins, \r\n  345 S.C. at 100, 545 S.E.2d at 537.\r\nThe family court in this case considered \r\n  all fifteen of the statutory factors regarding equitable apportionment found \r\n  in section 20-7-472, and made extensive written findings regarding these factors.Â  \r\n  Initially, the court noted that Husband made the major direct contributions \r\n  to the marital property but that Wife made significant indirect contributions.Â  \r\n  The court found that both the home and the mobile home park had significant \r\n  special equity prior to the marriage.Â  \r\nWith respect to the home, the court found \r\n  that Husband made mortgage payments on the home for five and a half years while \r\n  Wife did not work.Â  Husband correctly asserts that significant improvements \r\n  had been made to the home during the marriage from marital funds, with most \r\n  of the direct contributions coming from Husbandâ€™s income.Â  These improvements \r\n  included installing a new roof, adding new carpeting, remodeling a bathroom \r\n  and kitchen, building a patio, and installing a pool.Â  However, at least some \r\n  of the repairs appear to have been financed with marital funds in the form of \r\n  insurance proceeds received by the parties after Hurricane Hugo.Â  \r\nThe family court also found that Wife \r\n  had assisted with the mobile home park and that some of the original mobile \r\n  homes had been replaced.Â  There is ample testimony in the record to support \r\n  this finding.Â  Husband testified that at least three mobile homes from the original \r\n  park had been replaced and four additional mobile homes acquired during the \r\n  marriage.Â  Wife also assisted with the running and maintenance of the mobile \r\n  home park during the marriage.Â  Wife testified that she helped Husband with \r\n  the parkâ€™s bookkeeping, raking, cleaning, shopping, and bank deposits.Â  Wifeâ€™s \r\n  daughter testified that Wife worked in the mobile home park during the marriage \r\n  by running errands.Â  Wifeâ€™s friend also testified that Wife worked in the park \r\n  by raking leaves and shopping for curtains.Â  \r\nBased on the record and the family courtâ€™s \r\n  extensive consideration of the apportionment factors in section 20-7-472, we \r\n  find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s equitable division of the marital \r\n  home and the mobile home park.\r\n\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alimony \r\n  and Alimony Security  \r\n\r\nHusband argues that the family courtâ€™s award \r\n  of $600 per month in permanent periodic alimony was excessive.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe decision of the family court with \r\n  respect to alimony will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  367, 369 (2002).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the judge is controlled \r\n  by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without \r\n  evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  (citation omitted).Â Â Â  In making an award \r\n  of alimony, the family court must consider the thirteen factors set forth in \r\n  section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003). â€œNo one factor \r\n  is dispositive.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, \r\n  425 (Ct. App. 2001) (citation omitted).Â  Alimony is awarded as a substitute \r\n  for support normally incident to a marital relationship and should place the \r\n  supported spouse, as nearly as possible, in the same position he or she enjoyed \r\n  during the marriage.Â  Id. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424.Â  \r\nIn this case, the family court carefully \r\n  considered and made written findings on all thirteen factors enumerated in section \r\n  20-3-130(C). Â However, Husband argues that the amount of alimony awarded to \r\n  Wife will place Wife above the standard that she enjoyed during the marriage, \r\n  and that it may operate as a disincentive for the Wife to provide her own support.Â  \r\n  The family court considered, and the evidence in the record supports a finding \r\n  that the standard of living the parties enjoyed during the marriage was such \r\n  that Husband provided for Wifeâ€™s needs.Â  However, Husband asserts that because \r\n  Wife re-entered the work force subsequent to the partiesâ€™ separation, her income, \r\n  in addition to an award of alimony, would exceed the standard of living enjoyed \r\n  during the marriage.Â  Husbandâ€™s argument is without merit.Â  The family court \r\n  considered Wifeâ€™s post-separation income.Â  The court evaluated Wifeâ€™s expenses \r\n  and income and determined that Wife would need approximately $1,000 per month \r\n  to meet her anticipated expenses.Â  Based on those financial findings, the family \r\n  court awarded Wife $600 per month in alimony.Â  We find this award is supported \r\n  by the evidence in the record, and therefore the family court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in awarding alimony.Â  \r\nHusband also argues that the family court \r\n  erred by requiring him to provide security for the alimony through a life insurance \r\n  policy in the amount of $25,000 because the court did not make specific findings \r\n  as required by section 20-3-130(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  Section 20-3-130(D) states: â€œIn making an award of alimony or separate maintenance \r\n  and support, the court may make provision for security for the payment . . . \r\n  with due consideration of the cost of premiums, insurance plans carried \r\n  by the parties during marriage, insurability of the payor spouse, the probable \r\n  economic condition of the supported spouse upon the death of the payor spouse, \r\n  and any other factors the court may deem relevant . . . .â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  There is no requirement that specific findings be made.Â  See Wooton \r\n  v. Wooton, 356 S.C. 473, 478, 589 S.E.2d 769, 771 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating \r\n  that while it is preferable for the family court judge to address the statutory \r\n  factors enumerated in section 20-3-130(D), the failure of the judge to make \r\n  such a finding does not require the appellate court to vacate the judgment below).Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this statute is similar \r\n  to the equitable apportionment statute, section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003), which requires the family court to â€œgive weightâ€ to certain \r\n  enumerated factors.Â  That statute has been interpreted as not requiring specific \r\n  findings by the family court as long as the factors were addressed with sufficiency \r\n  for the appellate court to conclude the family court was cognizant of the factors \r\n  in the particular case.Â  See Jenkins, 345 S.C. at 100, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  at 537.Â  Here, the court commented that Husband already had a $50,000 life insurance \r\n  policy in place and â€œthat circumstances justify requiring the Defendant to secure \r\n  his alimony payments[.]â€Â  Previously in its order, the court also thoroughly \r\n  discussed the various financial positions of the parties.Â  Thus, we believe \r\n  that the family court properly considered all requisite factors to secure alimony.\r\n\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees  \r\n\r\nHusband maintains \r\n  the family court erred in ordering him to contribute $8,000 towards Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. See Bowen v. Bowen, 327 \r\n  S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court, in determining \r\n  whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay \r\n  his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of \r\n  living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 \r\n  (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the \r\n  court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, \r\n  the time necessarily devoted to the case, counsel's professional standing, the \r\n  contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary \r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, \r\n  161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nThe family court found \r\n  that Wife needed assistance to pay her attorneyâ€™s fees and that Husband was \r\n  in a position to assist because he received all of the income-producing property \r\n  by way of equitable distribution.Â  The family court also found that Wife obtained \r\n  beneficial results in terms of equitable distribution and alimony.Â  The family \r\n  court considered the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, including the \r\n  impact of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Finally, the family court concluded that the amount \r\n  of $8,000 was reasonable in light of the Glasscock factors.Â  The court \r\n  expressly considered each of the Glasscock factors in the final order, \r\n  and we find no abuse of discretion in his award.Â  See Henggeler v. \r\n  Hansen, 333 S.C. 598, 605, 510 S.E.2d 722, 726 (Ct.

Whitt, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nMichael T. Cole and Charles R. Norris, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  This suit arises as a result \r\n  of an insurance dispute.Â  Appellant contends her late husbandâ€™s automobile insurance \r\n  policy either contained an automobile death indemnity provision or would have \r\n  if not for Respondentsâ€™ negligence.Â Â  The circuit court granted Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  motion for summary judgment as to the South Carolina parties and applied the \r\n  South Carolina door closing statute to dismiss the case.Â  We affirm as modified. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBrian and Jill McCall lived \r\n  in North Carolina and had a State Farm automobile insurance policy, which contained \r\n  an automobile death indemnity provision.Â  This North Carolina automobile insurance \r\n  policy was obtained through Tom Sawyer Agency.Â  In February 2000, Brian and \r\n  Jill McCall separated and Brian McCall moved to South Carolina.Â  In South Carolina, \r\n  Brian McCall contacted Sullivan Insurance Agency and acquired State Farm automobile \r\n  insurance for his vehicle.Â  Brian McCall purchased a State Farm policy containing \r\n  comprehensive and collision coverage, but not an automobile death indemnity \r\n  provision.Â  Brian McCall signed a policy application that explicitly omitted \r\n  the automobile death indemnity provision.\r\nJill McCall informed Tom Sawyer Agency that she \r\n  and Brian McCall had separated.Â  As a result, Tom Sawyer Agency removed the \r\n  automobile death indemnity coverage from the policy.Â  Tragically, in March 2000, \r\n  Brian McCall died in an automobile accident.Â  Appellant, Jill McCall, seeks \r\n  an automobile death indemnity from State Farm; however, the insurer denies one \r\n  existed at the time of the accident.Â  Appellant brought causes of action for \r\n  bad faith refusal to pay, negligent supervision, breach of contract, respondeat \r\n  superior, unfair trade practices, and negligence against State Farm and the \r\n  South Carolina agents that sold Brian McCall his policy.\r\nIt is undisputed that the North Carolina policy \r\n  originally contained an automobile death indemnity provision.Â  Appellant asserts \r\n  the South Carolina agents erred by omitting the death indemnity provision contained \r\n  in the North Carolina policy when they wrote the South Carolina policy.\r\nIn February 2002, the circuit court heard Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  motion for summary judgment and dismissed the two South Carolina insurance agents, \r\n  Marcia Hardy and Kimberly Sullivan, as well as any claims arising from the South \r\n  Carolina policy.Â  However, the court did grant Appellant thirty days to amend \r\n  her complaint to allege a cause of action arising under the North Carolina policy.Â  \r\n  No appeal was taken from this Order.Â  Appellant filed an amended complaint restating \r\n  her claims as arising under the North Carolina policy. \r\nIn the amended complaint, Appellant \r\n  maintained the South Carolina agents caused the North Carolina automobile death \r\n  indemnity provision to be cancelled and they failed to notify Brian McCall of \r\n  the cancellation or provide him a refund of the unearned premium.Â  Respondents \r\n  deny the South Carolina agents had any involvement with the cancellation of \r\n  the North Carolina automobile death indemnity provision. \r\nIn October 2002, the circuit court heard \r\n  Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment as to the claims in the amended complaint.Â  \r\n  Again, the South Carolina insurance agents were dismissed from the case.Â  In \r\n  addition, the court applied the door closing statute, section 15-5-150 of the \r\n  South Carolina Code, to dismiss the suit because neither Jill McCall nor State \r\n  Farm is a resident of South Carolina.Â  Appellant argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment and in applying section 15-5-150 to the North Carolina \r\n  claims.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate only when â€˜the \r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.â€™â€Â Â  Trivelas v.

Specialty Transp. Servs., ___ S.C. ___, ___, 594 S.E.2d 867, \r\n  ___ (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nOn April 8, 2002, the circuit court signed an order \r\n  dismissing Marcia Hardy and Kimberly Sullivan from the case, stating â€œthere \r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact as to the plaintiffâ€™s claim under or related \r\n  to the South Carolina policy and, therefore, the plaintiffâ€™s claims related \r\n  to that policy and to the State Farm insurance agents involved in the issuance \r\n  of that policy are dismissed with prejudice.â€Â  Appellant did not appeal, but \r\n  filed an amended complaint as allowed by the Order.Â  Therefore, the ruling by \r\n  the circuit court is the law of the case.\r\nThe April 8, 2002 Order dismissed the South Carolina \r\n  agents.Â  Appellant tried to avoid this Order by amending the complaint to allege \r\n  the South Carolina agents caused the North Carolina automobile death indemnity \r\n  provision to be cancelled and failed to notify Brian McCall of the cancellation \r\n  or provide him a refund of the unearned premium.Â  In the initial complaint, \r\n  the Appellant asserted the South Carolina agents erred by omitting the death \r\n  indemnity provision contained in the North Carolina policy.\r\nAppellant relies on this difference in verbiage \r\n  to suggest she is advancing different actions in the first and amended complaint.Â  \r\n  However, the result under each is the sameâ€”no automobile death indemnity provision \r\n  exists.Â  This similarity is reinforced by Jill McCallâ€™s affidavit submitted \r\n  during the second summary judgment motion hearing:Â  â€œThe change in coverage \r\n  on the North Carolina State Farm Insurance policy, caused by the issuance of \r\n  the new South Carolina State Farm Insurance policy, had the same result as canceling \r\n  the death indemnity coverage under the North Carolina State Farm Insurance Policy.â€Â  \r\n  During the second summary judgment hearing, Appellantâ€™s counsel summarized that \r\n  â€œsomething happened between the North Carolina agents and the South Carolina \r\n  agents that caused coverage to lap[se] under that North Carolina policy.â€\r\nVeritably, any difference in argument \r\n  advanced against the South Carolina agents in the initial and amended complaint \r\n  is nothing more than semantic.Â  In both complaints, Appellant essentially argues \r\n  the South Carolina agentsâ€™ omission of the death indemnity provision had the \r\n  effect of canceling the provision.Â  The April 8, 2002 Order dismissed this claim.Â  \r\n  Because that Order was not appealed, a challenge on this point is not properly \r\n  before this court.\r\n\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary \r\n  Judgment Proceeding  \r\n\r\nDuring the summary judgment motion, there were \r\n  four affidavits before the circuit court that stated the South Carolina agents \r\n  had no involvement in the cancellation of the North Carolina death indemnity \r\n  policy.Â  These included affidavits from agents Marcia Hardy and Kimberly Sullivan, \r\n  which denied any involvement in canceling the death indemnity provision.Â  Another \r\n  affidavit came from Audrey Martens, a State Farm employee in the underwriting \r\n  department, who reported the death indemnity provision was removed as a result \r\n  of a change sent to State Farm underwriting from Tom Sawyer Agency.Â  Finally, \r\n  there is an affidavit from Judith Sawyer, of Tom Sawyer Agency, stating that \r\n  after the agency learned of the McCallsâ€™ separation, the agency removed the \r\n  death indemnity provision from the North Carolina policy as a result of the \r\n  separation.Â  The assertion that the provision was removed at the instruction \r\n  of Tom Sawyer Agency after they learned of the McCallâ€™s separation is supported \r\n  by the fact that Appellant admits to advising Judith Sawyer that the couple \r\n  had separated.\r\nâ€œOnce the party moving for summary judgment \r\n  meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the \r\n  opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot rest on mere allegations or denials contained \r\n  in the pleadings.Â  Rather, the non-moving party must come forward with specific \r\n  facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.â€Â  Hansen v. United Serv. \r\n  Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 67, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002); see \r\n  also Humana Hosp.-Bayside v. Lightle, 305 S.C. 214, 216-17, 407 S.E.2d \r\n  637, 638 (1991).Â  Because four affidavits state the South Carolina agents were \r\n  not involved, Appellant cannot simply rest on her pleadings.Â  Appellant submitted \r\n  one affidavit for the circuit courtâ€™s consideration, but this affidavit does \r\n  not address with any specificity the alleged actions the South Carolina agents \r\n  took to cancel the death indemnity provision.Â  Appellant submitted no evidence \r\n  to support her conclusion that the South Carolina actors had any involvement \r\n  with the cancellation of the automobile death indemnity provision; apodictically, \r\n  a consideration of the grant of summary judgment on its merits would yield the \r\n  same result reached by simply applying the law of the case.\r\n\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Door closing statute  \r\n\r\nAfter the circuit court determined the claims against \r\n  the South Carolina agents should be dismissed with prejudice, the remaining \r\n  parties were: (1) Appellant, a North Carolina resident, (2) and State Farm Mutual \r\n  Automobile Insurance Company, an out-of-state corporation.Â  The subject of the \r\n  suit was a North Carolina insurance policy.Â  Accordingly, the court determined \r\n  that the door closing statute, section 15-5-150 of the South Carolina Code, \r\n  prohibited the court from having subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.\r\nSection 15-5-150 states: \r\n\r\nAn action against a corporation created by or under the \r\n  laws of any other state . . . may be brought in the circuit court: (1) By any \r\n  resident of this state for any cause of action; or (2) By a plaintiff not a \r\n  resident of this State when the cause of action shall have arisen or the subject \r\n  of the action shall be situated within this State.\r\n\r\nS.C.

App. 2004).Â  Cause of action is the â€œlegal wrong threatened or \r\n  committed against the complaining party,â€ while â€œsubject of the actionâ€ is â€œthe \r\n  matter or thing, differing both from the wrong and the relief, in regard to \r\n  which the controversy has arisen, concerning which the wrong has been done; \r\n  and this is, ordinarily the property, or the contract and its subject matter, \r\n  or the thing involved in the dispute.â€Â  Murphy v.

City \r\n  of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  Therefore, \r\n  this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\nEven if we were to consider Appellantâ€™s argument that the \r\n  door closing statute does not apply because the cause of action is not the Appellantâ€™s \r\n  personal claim but the decedentâ€™s as insured, we would affirm.Â  Appellant relies \r\n  upon South Carolina case law allowing an action for wrongful cancellation to \r\n  be brought during the lifetime of the insured by either the insured or beneficiary \r\n  if the beneficiaryâ€™s interest is an absolute and indefeasible vested interest.Â  \r\n  Further, an action after the death of the beneficiary is viable.Â  Babb v. \r\n  Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 224 S.C. 1, 9, 77 S.E.2d 267, 271 (1953).Â  Babb \r\n  only addresses the beneficiaryâ€™s capacity to bring a suit for wrongful cancellation, \r\n  not the implications of a suit brought by a beneficiary and its relationship \r\n  to the survival statute.Â  \r\nBecause of the holding in Babb, we find it necessary \r\n  to consider South Carolinaâ€™s interest in adjudicating this suit.Â  The door closing \r\n  statute serves three basic objectives.Â  \r\n\r\nFirst, it favors resident plaintiffs over non-resident plaintiffs.Â  \r\n  Second, it provides a forum for wrongs connected with the state while avoiding \r\n  the resolution of wrongs in which the state has little interest.Â  Third, it \r\n  encourages activity and investment within the state by foreign corporations \r\n  without subjecting them to actions unrelated to their activity within the state.\r\n\r\nMurphy v.

Lunsford, \r\n  272 S.C. 527, 531-32, 252 S.E.2d 918, 920-21 (1979).Â  The supreme court in Murphy \r\n  explicated the door closing statuteâ€™s policies:\r\n\r\nThe first policy, favoring resident plaintiffs, is reflected \r\n  in subsection (1) of Â§ 15-5-150 of the Door Closing Statute, which allows â€œany \r\n  resident of this Stateâ€ to maintain â€œany cause of action.â€Â  This subsection, \r\n  essentially â€œopening the Doorâ€ for resident plaintiffs, is irrelevant to determining \r\n  whether . . . a nonresident . . . has the capacity to maintain this suit.Â  The \r\n  second policy expressed in the statute restricts actions brought in state courts \r\n  to those where the alleged wrong is connected to the State. . . .Â  The third \r\n  policy consideration when a nonresident seeks to sue a foreign corporation in \r\n  state court is whether the suit is predicated on the corporationâ€™s in-state \r\n  activities.\r\n\r\nMurphy, 356 S.C. at 597, 590 S.E.2d at 481-82.Â  The \r\n  third statutory provision â€œprohibits a non-resident from maintaining an action \r\n  against a foreign corporation in a South Carolina court unless the cause of \r\n  action arose in South Carolina or the subject of the action is located there.â€Â  \r\n  Murphy, 346 S.C. at 45, 550 S.E.2d at 589.Â  Appellant is a not a South \r\n  Carolina resident.Â  This cause of action relates to a North Carolina insurance \r\n  policy provision that all evidence suggests was removed by individuals in North \r\n  Carolina.Â  Finally, all evidence demonstrates that State Farmâ€™s actions in South \r\n  Carolina are unrelated to any potential liability created by its actions in \r\n  North Carolina.Â  All three objectives of the door closing statute evince that \r\n  South Carolina has no interest in providing a forum for this suit and require \r\n  application of section 15-5-150.\r\nAppellantâ€™s contention that she is bringing the \r\n  suit on behalf of the deceased is answered by the fact that the named plaintiff \r\n  in this case is Jill McCall rather than the Estate of Brian McCall.Â  Appellant \r\n  is not asserting the decedentâ€™s personal claim, but her claim as beneficiary.Â  \r\n  Additionally, Appellantâ€™s complaint contains statements that Jill McCall would \r\n  have benefited from the death indemnity provision.Â  If the action were brought \r\n  solely to assert the decedentâ€™s claims, discussion of the indemnityâ€™s benefit \r\n  to her would be unnecessary.Â Â  \r\n Recently, our supreme court addressed \r\n  the door closing statute in Farmer v. Monsanto, 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d \r\n  325 (2003).Â  In the case sub judice, the circuit court found it lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction over the case because of the door closing statute, \r\n  but this is at variance with the conclusion reached in Farmer.Â  Farmer \r\n  overruled prior case law and determined the door closing statute does not involve \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction, but instead the capacity of a party to sue.Â  Id. \r\n  353 S.C. at 556-57, 579 S.E.2d at 327-28.Â  The decision in Farmer does \r\n  not impact the conclusion reached by the circuit court.Â  Farmer edifies: â€œÂ§ \r\n  15-5-150 does not involve subject matter jurisdiction but rather determines \r\n  the capacity of a party to sue.â€Â  Id. at 557, 579 S.E.2d at 327; accord \r\n  Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc., ___ S.C. ___, ___, 594 S.E.2d \r\n  878, ___ (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
