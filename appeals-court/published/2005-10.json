Jenkinson, III, both of Kingstree, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this civil action, QHG of Lake City, Inc. appeals the award of $750,000 in actual damages and $1,250,000 in punitive damages in favor of Jenny C. Mishoe.Â  QHG alleges a new trial should be granted as a result of an improper closing argument and the circuit courtâ€™s erroneous restriction of the scope of QHGâ€™s cross-examination of Mishoe.Â  Moreover, QHG argues the evidence does not support an award of punitive damages.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 3, 1998, Jenny C. Mishoe visited her grandmother at Carolinas Hospital System, a wholly owned facility of QHG of Lake City, Inc.Â  After the visit, Mishoe left the hospital via the emergency room exit and proceeded to her car across the horseshoe drive area in front of the emergency room doors.Â  While walking across the pavement near the emergency room exit, Mishoeâ€™s left foot got caught in a hole.Â  Mishoe suffered serious injuries to both her left ankle and right knee.Â  \r\nQHG was required to perform regular, twice-yearly safety inspections of its premises to maintain its accreditation.Â  On July 1, 1997, the head of maintenance for the hospital, Edward McDonald, provided the hospital with a written report stating a hole existed in the pavement near the emergency room exit.Â  The hospital took no action to repair the hole or warn visitors and patients of the holeâ€™s existence.Â  \r\nThe matter proceeded to trial and the jury returned a verdict in Mishoeâ€™s favor in the amount of $750,000 actual damages and $1,250,000 punitive damages.Â  The jury found Mishoe ten percent comparatively negligent, and the circuit court reduced the actual damages accordingly.Â  QHG made a motion for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of punitive damages, which the circuit court denied.Â  The circuit court also denied QHGâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Punitive Damages\r\nQHG alleges the circuit court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict and judgment not withstanding the verdict on the issue of punitive damages.[1]Â  Specifically, QHG argues the circuit court erred because there was no clear and convincing evidence the hospitalâ€™s actions constituted willful, wanton, or reckless conduct.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, the appellate court applies the same standard as the circuit court.Â  Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 199, 592 S.E.2d 626, 627 (2004).Â  When ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the circuit court must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should be denied.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, the appellate court may only reverse if there is no evidence to support the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.Â  South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yessen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, 885 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Neither the circuit court nor the appellate court has the authority to decide credibility issues or resolve conflicts in testimony.Â  Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 99, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIn order to receive an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or with reckless disregard for the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (2004); Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 221, 479 S.E.2d 35, 46 (1996).Â  A conscious failure to exercise due care constitutes willfulness.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 301, 536 S.E.2d 408, 419 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  When evidence exists that suggests a defendant is aware of a dangerous condition and does not take action to minimize or avoid the danger, sufficient evidence exists to create a jury issue as to whether there is clear and convincing evidence of willfulness.Â  See McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 346, 468 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1996).Â  The issue of punitive damages must be submitted to the jury if more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence as to whether the defendantâ€™s behavior was reckless, willful, or wanton.Â  Welch, 342 S.C. at 301, 536 S.E.2d at 419.Â  \r\nThe amount of damages, actual or punitive, remains largely within the discretion of the finder of fact, as reviewed by the trial judge.Â  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991).Â  The trial judge is vested with considerable discretion over the amount of a punitive damages award, and this courtâ€™s review is limited to correction of errors of law.Â  Welch, 342 S.C. at 305, 536 S.E.2d at 421.Â  Moreover, the appellate court must affirm the circuit courtâ€™s punitive damages finding if any evidence reasonably supports the courtâ€™s factual findings.Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 314, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nHere, the evidence demonstrates the head of maintenance for QHG provided actual, written notice of the existence of the hole in question to the CEO of the hospital on July 1, 1997, almost one year before the accident occurred.Â  QHG took no action to repair the hole after receiving notice of its existence.Â  Moreover, the hospital took no precautions to warn visitors or patients of the existence of the hole.Â  Therefore, we find the evidence of this written notice is sufficient to submit the issue of QHGâ€™s willful, wanton, reckless, or malicious conduct to the jury.\r\nII.Â  Mistrial Motion\r\nQHG next argues the circuit court erred in failing to grant its motion for a mistrial.Â  QHG alleges comments made by Mishoe during closing arguments could not be remedied by the circuit courtâ€™s curative instruction and, therefore, a mistrial was warranted.Â  Specifically, QHG claims any reference to the $2.8 million sales price of the hospital resulted in sufficient prejudice to justify a mistrial.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe granting or denying of a motion for mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. Partnership, 334 S.C. 96, 118, 512 S.E.2d 510, 521 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Absent an abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial judge will not be overturned on appeal.Â  Id.Â  The burden is on the moving party to show not only error, but also the resulting prejudice.Â  Id.Â  The granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only when an incident is so grievous that the prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999).\r\nWhen an objection is timely made to improper remarks of counsel during closing arguments, the judge should rule on the objection, give a curative charge to the jury, and instruct offending counsel to desist from improper remarks.Â  McElveen v. Ferre, 299 S.C. 377, 381, 385 S.E.2d 39, 41 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In this matter, counsel for Mishoe made the following remarks to the jury on the issue of punitive damages:\r\n\r\nWhat is the reasonable relationship to harm-and there was harm-and the defendantâ€™s ability to pay.Â  [sic]Â  I ainâ€™t too much worried about that hospital paying.Â  When they left Williamsburg County, they left with 2.8 million dollars worth of our money just when they left.\r\n\r\nAt that time, counsel for QHG objected, and stated:\r\n\r\nQHG: Your Honor, Iâ€™d object to any testimony about how much money the hospital sold for, and everybody knows-\r\nThe Court: The objection is-\r\nQHG: -the price of the deal\r\nThe Court: Yes, sir.\r\nQHG:Â  And I would move for a mistrial.\r\nThe Court:Â  Pardon?\r\nQHG: Iâ€™d move for a mistrial.\r\nThe Court:Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the objection is sustained and you are to disregard the last argument by counsel.Â  And, counsel, you are not to argue that particular issue.Â  The motion is otherwise denied.\r\n\r\nAfter the curative instruction was given, no additional objection was made by\r\nQHG.&nbsp; \r\nThe circuit court followed the procedure established in McElveen.Â  The judge ruled on QHGâ€™s objection, offered a curative instruction to the jury, and admonished Mishoeâ€™s counsel not to mention the sales price and the fact it was â€œour moneyâ€ again.Â  See McElveen, 299 S.C. at 381, 385 S.E.2d at 41.Â  The curative instruction adequately corrected the statement and advised the jury to disregard.Â  Moreover, the sales price of the hospital had already been admitted, and the jury heard the amount during the trial.Â  QHG cannot demonstrate evidence of a prejudicial effect warranting a mistrial.Â  See Creighton, 334 S.C. at 118, 512 S.E.2d at 521.Â  Therefore, we find the trial judge did not abuse his broad discretion in denying the mistrial motion.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Scope of cross-examination\r\nQHG also argues the trial court erred in limiting the scope of its cross-examination of Mishoe.Â  Specifically, QHG asserts the circuit court erred in prohibiting it from questioning Mishoe on her prior litigation history as it was relevant to her credibility.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission and rejection of testimony is largely within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion or its decision was controlled by an error of law.Â  Ippolito v. Hospitality Mgt. Assocs., 352 S.C. 563, 569, 575 S.E.2d 562, 566 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIn this case, QHG argues the medical records of Dr. Hazelwood, a treating physician, are important to prove that Mishoeâ€™s medical condition had nothing to do with the fall at the hospital.Â  The trial judge allowed QHG to introduce the majority of the medical records of Dr. Hazelwood.Â  The trial judge allowed into evidence the portion of the records relevant to QHGâ€™s argument.Â  The evidence in those records was relevant to the issue of whether Mishoe sought treatment from Dr. Hazelwood for injuries unrelated to the fall at the hospital was admitted.Â  The only sentence the trial judge did not admit was Dr. Mendes â€œrefused to see her again because of her prior experience with litigation.â€Â  The trial judge allowed QHG to cross-examine Mishoe on her relevant medical history.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in limiting the scope of the cross-examination.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the circuit court and award of punitive damages is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] QHG does not ask this court to review the circuit courtâ€™s Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991), punitive damages analysis.Â  Although QHG takes issue with opposing counselâ€™s comment during closing argument regarding the $2.8 million sale of the hospital, it does so only by arguing a mistrial should have been granted.Â  See infra.Â  QHG does not assert the use of the $2.8 million sales price was an improper method to value QHGâ€™s net worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4028","title":"Armstrong v.

State, 338 S.C. 634, 650, 528 S.E.2d 647, 655 (1999) (upholding the portion of the legislative act banning cash payouts effective July 1, 2000).Â  Collins Entertainment owed SouthTrust somewhere between $13 and $20 million in principal and interest.Â  \r\nDuring this period, an idea was developed to alter old, existing bingo machines such that they could generate additional revenue.Â  Armstrong testified that he came up with the idea when he noticed that the supreme courtâ€™s opinion in Joytime excluded Class III Bingo machines.Â  Although the licensing fee for Class III Bingo machines was $2000 per year, Armstrong discovered that older machines could be modified and licensed under a different class that had only a $100 per year licensing fee.Â  \r\nArmstrong testified that he discussed his idea with Collins, who was unconvinced at first.Â  Collins allowed Armstrong to use some old machines that Collins owned personally to construct working models.Â  Armstrong worked on the project during hours that he was not working for Collins Entertainment.Â  Armstrong stated that he made four modifications to the machines, including adding an electronic circuit board, a flipper to bring the machine within the â€œgame of skillâ€ requirement for the lower licensing fee, and a printer to print tickets showing credits won which would be redeemable for merchandise.Â  Armstrong applied for a patent for the new Skillpins machine.Â Â  \r\nArmstrong was interested in going into business for himself and wanted to work about fourteen more years before retirement.Â  Because Collins Entertainment was so heavily laden with debt, Armstrong testified that Collins proposed that a separate entity be created to market the Skillpins machines.Â  The new corporation would be ninety percent owned by Collins and ten percent owned by Armstrong.Â  Armstrong would also be guaranteed a salary of $150,000 a year.Â  Armstrong would later resign from Collins Entertainment and run the new corporation.Â  Additionally, Armstrong testified that Collins agreed to personally borrow $1,000,000 from the bank, with Armstrong co-signing, to fund the endeavor.Â  The agreement, however, was never reduced to writing.Â  \r\nCollins instructed Armstrong to go to Europe to secure exclusive distribution agreements for the new venture, later called Skillpins, Inc.Â  The trips were successful, resulting in agreements with G.A.A., Seeben, and Splin S.A.Â  The agreements were executed in the Skillpins name, as instructed by Collins.Â  Skillpins was to use separate contracts, delivery slips, and work slips.Â  Collins Entertainment paid for the trips, but Skillpins was to reimburse Collins Entertainment once it became profitable.Â  Employees of Collins Entertainment also accompanied Armstrong on the trip.Â  Dennis Cosentino, one of the employees who traveled with Armstrong, testified that during the trip, Armstrong was the most excited he had seen him in twenty years because Armstrong was going to be a part owner.Â  Armstrong testified that he would not have made these trips but for the promise of part ownership.Â Â  \r\nWhen the corporation later began operating, separate contracts were employed for Skillpins machines, even if Collins Entertainment machines were already operating at the location.Â  Collins had never previously created a corporation for a specific product in South Carolina.Â  Armstrong continued to work on the Skillpins project during hours he was not working for Collins Entertainment, and he executed agreements using the Skillpins name.Â  \r\nTim Youmans, an attorney working for Collins Entertainment and later for Armstrong, testified that Collins told him that he had decided to give Armstrong ten percent of the new corporation that was to be separate and unencumbered by the SouthTrust debt.Â  According to both Youmans and Armstrong, Collins instructed Youmans to find a shell corporation owned by Collins personally that was not encumbered with the SouthTrust debt.Â  Youmans found a corporation meeting the criteria, and the corporationâ€™s name was changed to Skillpins, Inc.Â  On the same date, another corporation under the Collins Entertainment umbrella was renamed Skill Flippers, LLC.Â  This entity was to be the distribution vehicle for Skillpins, Inc.Â  However, it was never used for that purpose.Â  \r\nThe agreement between Armstrong and Collins was to be reduced to writing later by Richard Cox, an outside attorney for Collins Entertainment.Â  Eventually, Armstrong and Collins met with Cox.Â  According to Armstrong, Collins informed Cox that Skillpins was to be an entity completely separate from Collins Entertainment, that Armstrong would own ten percent of the corporation, and that Collins wanted to be a silent partner.Â  Cox testified that the partiesâ€™ intent was to set up an independent entity with each having an ownership position.Â  Collins gave Armstrong constant assurances that the paperwork would soon be generated.Â  Cox never prepared the documents.Â Â Â  \r\nCollins held a meeting at Collins Entertainment with upper level management and he discussed Skillpins.Â  Armstrongâ€™s recollection of the meeting was that Collins informed the other employees that Skillpins was Armstrongâ€™s idea, and that a separate corporation was to be formed of which Armstrong would own ten percent.Â  Collins recalled stating that he had offered Armstrong ten percent of Collins Entertainment, not ten percent of Skillpins.Â  \r\nBy November of 2000, two or three hundred Skillpins machines were operating and producing income.[2]Â  At that time, Armstrong discovered information concerning Skillpins was included in Collins Entertainmentâ€™s profit and loss statement.Â  Armstrong confronted Collins, and Collins confirmed that Skillpins had been brought under the Collins Entertainment umbrella.Â  Collins offered Armstrong ten percent of Collins Entertainment.Â  Armstrong refused, saying he did not want ten percent of the $13 to $20 million debt.Â  Collins laughed and said he did not think Armstrong would.Â  Armstrong immediately resigned.Â Â  \r\nSkillpins, Inc., purchased all the Skillpins machines.Â  However, Collins Entertainment paid for the machines and booked all the machines as Collins Entertainment assets.Â  Collins Entertainment started another patent application, listing Collins and his son as the inventors.Â  This application was never filed.Â  Within thirty days after litigation ensued, Skillpins, Inc. was dissolved.Â  In 2001, Skillpins machines generated sixty-seven and one-half percent of Collins Entertainmentâ€™s revenues.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter Armstrong resigned, he formed his own corporation with Youmans as a minority shareholder.Â  At the time of the hearing, Armstrongâ€™s corporation operated about 250 Skillpins machines and over 100 video redemption games.Â  However, Armstrongâ€™s declining health forced him to stop working full-time after January of 2001.Â Â Â  \r\nArmstrong brought an action against Collins alleging fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of South Carolinaâ€™s Unfair Trade Practices Act, and the case was tried before a jury.Â  In his opening statement, counsel for Armstrong stated that the case was â€œabout whether or not there was a contract between Fred Collins and Marshall Armstrong.â€Â  Counsel further stated that the question for the jury was whether they had a meeting of the minds.Â  However, counsel for Collins later objected to admission of evidence of the financial success of video poker in part on the ground that no breach of contract had been alleged in this case.Â Â  \r\nAt the close of Armstrongâ€™s case, he moved to amend the complaint to add causes of action for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, arguing that the existence of a contract was implicit in the factual basis for the case.Â  Counsel for Collins objected on the ground that they were unable to conduct discovery and cross-examine witnesses with these causes of action in mind.Â  The court granted the amendment, finding no prejudice because the existence of a contract was an integral part of the case.Â  However, the court allowed defense counsel to recall Armstrong for further cross-examination.Â  Collins then moved for a continuance or adjournment, which was denied.Â  Later, Collins testified on direct that he and Armstrong â€œnever had a meeting of the mindsâ€ and that their agreement never got past â€œstep two.â€Â Â  \r\nArmstrong then rested, and Collins immediately moved for a directed verdict on all causes of action.Â  The trial court granted the motion with respect to the unfair trade practices cause of action but denied the motion on all other causes of action.Â  At the close of the evidence and again after the verdict, defense counsel renewed the motion, and the trial judge reiterated its prior ruling.Â Â Â  \r\nThe case was submitted to a jury on a special verdict form.Â  The jury found for Armstrong on all six causes of action, awarding $300,000 for each cause of action.Â  The jury also awarded $1.2 million in punitive damages.Â  When asked by the trial court for clarification of the verdict, the foreperson responded that the jury calculated actual damages of over $1.7 million and rounded up to $1.8 million.Â  They then simply divided the total by six, intending to find for the plaintiff on all causes of action.Â  Without objection, the court enrolled the actual damages as a general verdict for $1.8 million.Â Â  The court denied all of Collinsâ€™ other motions.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.â€Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The trial court is only concerned with the â€œexistence or nonexistence of evidence.â€Â  Long v. Norris &amp; Assocs., 342 S.C. 561, 568, 538 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œWhen the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.â€Â  Id.Â  However, â€œif more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Id.Â  On appeal from the denial of a motion for a directed verdict or JNOV, this court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Directed Verdict \r\nCollins argues the trial court erred by failing to grant him a directed verdict because Armstrong failed to prove all the necessary elements for each of the six causes of action that went to the jury.Â  Collins also argues that he should have been granted a directed verdict because the alleged agreement was unenforceable.Â  Collins asserts the parties could not legally have entered into a contract that would deprive SouthTrust Bank of its security interest.Â  We address each of these arguments below.Â Â Â  \r\nA. Fraud/Constructive Fraud/Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nCollins argues that Armstrong failed to produce evidence to support fraud, constructive fraud, and negligent misrepresentation because Armstrong had no right to rely upon representations that Skillpins would be separate from Collins Entertainment.Â  Collins argues that any such representation would have been inconsistent with knowledge Armstrong, as president of Collins Entertainment, would have gained regarding the SouthTrust Bank loan.Â  We disagree. \r\nTo sustain a claim of fraud, all of the following elements must be proven:\r\n\r\n(1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.Â  \r\n\r\nRegions Bank v. Schmuch, 354 S.C. 648, 672, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444-45 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe right to rely must be determined in light of the plaintiffâ€™s duty to use reasonable prudence and diligence under the circumstances in identifying the truth with respect to the representations made to him.â€Â  Id. at 672, 582 S.E.2d at 445.Â  Fraud must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Ardis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 515, 431 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  A party may not rely upon a misstatement of fact when the truth is easily within his reach.Â  King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 312, 318 S.E.2d 125, 128 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œIt is the policy of the courts not only to discourage fraud, but also to discourage negligence and inattention to oneâ€™s own interests.â€Â \r\nId.Â  However, a party may rely on representations without making further inquiry when a fiduciary or confidential relationship exists between the parties.Â  Epstein v. Howell, 308 S.C. 528, 530-31, 419 S.E.2d 379, 380-82 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜To establish constructive fraud, all elements of actual fraud except the element of intent must be established.â€™â€Â  Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 333, 574 S.E.2d 502, 509 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Ardis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 515, 431 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App. 1993)).Â  â€œNeither actual dishonesty of purpose nor intent to deceive is an essential element of constructive fraud while intent to deceive is an essential element of actual fraud.â€Â  Ardis, 314 S.C. at 516, 431 S.E.2d at 269-70.Â  Actual fraud is distinguished from constructive fraud by the presence or absence of the intent to deceive.Â  Pitts, 352 S.C. at 334, 574 S.E.2d at 509.Â  â€œHowever, in a constructive fraud case, where there is no confidential or fiduciary relationship, and an armâ€™s length transaction between mature, educated people is involved, there is no right to rely.â€Â  Ardis, 314 S.C. at 516, 431 S.E.2d at 270.Â  \r\nIn a negligent misrepresentation action, a plaintiff must prove the following: \r\n\r\n(1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the statement, (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff, (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care, (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation, and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance on the representation.Â  \r\n\r\nBrown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 42, 557 S.E.2d 676, 680-81 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The key difference between fraud and negligent misrepresentation is that â€œfraud requires the conveyance of a known falsity, while negligent misrepresentation is predicated upon transmission of a negligently made false statement.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œA duty to exercise reasonable care in giving information exists when the defendant has a pecuniary interest in the transaction.â€Â  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 474, 581 S.E.2d 496, 504 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe recovery of damages may be predicated upon a negligently made false statement where a party suffers either injury or loss as a consequence of relying upon the misrepresentation.â€Â  Winburn v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 287 S.C. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 142, 146 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  A claim for negligent misrepresentation may be made when the misrepresented facts induced the plaintiff to enter a contract or business transaction.Â  Redwend, 354 S.C. at 474, 581 S.E.2d at 504.Â Â Â  \r\nEach of the above causes of action contains the necessary element that the hearer had the right to rely upon the misrepresentation or fraud.Â  Collins argues that Armstrong had no right to rely on the promise that he would be part owner of a corporate entity separate from Collins Entertainment because he was imputed with knowledge of the SouthTrust Bank security interest in any potential new business due to his position as president of Collins Entertainment.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Armstrong, we find there was sufficient evidence to submit these causes of action to the jury.Â  Armstrong testified that he was only in charge of day-to-day operations of Collins Entertainment, that he had no control over financial matters, and that he did not know what the SouthTrust Bank security agreement covered.Â  Collins, not Armstrong, was a signatory to the agreement with SouthTrust Bank.Â  Collins represented to Armstrong that he intended to create a new corporation, unencumbered by SouthTrustâ€™s security interest, in which Armstrong would have ten percent ownership.Â  Great care was taken to locate a corporate shell owned by Collins personally, not by Collins Entertainment, in order to create Skillpins as a separate entity.Â  Although some Collins Entertainment resources were used in sending Armstrong to Europe, there is evidence that Collins, as Armstrongâ€™s longtime friend, assured him that Skillpins would be separate from Collins Entertainment.Â  Further, evidence was presented that Collins intended to personally sign a loan for the startup money for Skillpins.Â  Thus, evidence existed that Armstrong had the right to rely upon Collinsâ€™ promises that Skillpins would be a separate entity.Â  \r\nBecause evidence existed to support the element of Armstrongâ€™s right to rely, the trial court correctly denied Collinsâ€™ motions for a directed verdict with regard to fraud, constructive fraud, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  The matter was appropriately sent to the jury.Â Â Â  \r\nB. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nCollins asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict as to Armstrongâ€™s cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  He maintains that no fiduciary relationship existed.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œA confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one imposing the confidence.â€Â  Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 599, 358 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  A relationship must be more than casual to equal a fiduciary relationship.Â  Steele v. Victory Sav. Bank, 294 S.C. 290, 368 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œCourts of equity have carefully refrained from defining the particular instances of fiduciary relationship in such a manner that other and perhaps new cases might be excluded and have refused to set any bounds to the circumstances out of which a fiduciary relationship may spring.â€Â  Island Car Wash, Inc., 292 S.C. at 599, 358 S.E.2d at 152; see Burwell v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 41, 340 S.E.2d 786, 790 (1986) (â€œAs a general rule, mere respect for anotherâ€™s judgment or trust in his character is usually not sufficient to establish such a [fiduciary] relationship.Â  The facts and circumstances must indicate that one reposing the trust has foundation for his belief that the one giving advice or presenting arguments is acting not in his own behalf, but in the interests of the other party.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nPitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 330, 574 S.E.2d 502, 507 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, to determine whether a fiduciary relationship existed, this court must look to the particulars of the relationship between the parties.Â  Id.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Armstrong, there was sufficient evidence to send the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty to the jury.Â  Evidence was presented at trial that Armstrong and Collins intended Skillpins to be a separate entity from Collins Entertainment.Â  Armstrong testified that Collins assured him that he would create a business entity that would be separate from Collins Entertainmentâ€™s debts.Â  Armstrong was entrusted to develop the Skillpins product, test it, and obtain manufacturers.Â  Thus, evidence existed that the parties had a special relationship, separate from Collins Entertainment, in which each entrusted the other to act in good faith and with due regard for the interests of the other.Â  Because evidence existed of a fiduciary relationship, the trial court properly denied Collinsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nC. Breach of Contract Claims\r\nCollins next argues that the trial court should have directed a verdict on Armstrongâ€™s claims for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  He argues Collins only promised to give Armstrong a gift in the future that did not amount to a contract.Â  Thus, he argues, there was no contract, and he was entitled to a directed verdict as to both contract causes of action.[3]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe required elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 406, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003). Â â€œA contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct.â€Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Valuable consideration may consist of â€œsome right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.â€Â  Prestwick Golf Club, Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 331 S.C. 385, 389, 503 S.E.2d 184, 186 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  A benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee may provide sufficient consideration for a contract.Â  Shayne of Miami, Inc. v. Greybow, Inc., 232 S.C. 161, 167, 101 S.e.2d 486, 489 (1957).Â  If the evidence as to the existence of a contract is conflicting or raises more than one reasonable inference, the issue should be submitted to the jury.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 459, 578 S.E.2d 711, 716 (2003).Â  With certain exceptions, a contract need not be in writing to be enforceable.Â  Gaskins v. Firemenâ€™s Ins. Co. of Newark, N.J., 206 S.C. 213, 216, 33 S.E.2d 498, 499 (1945) (noting that if there is a meeting of the minds with regard to the essential elements of a contract, it is immaterial whether the contract is written or oral).Â  \r\nHaving a contract is a prerequisite to proving breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  To prove this cause of action, a plaintiff must show: (1) a breach of contract; (2) fraudulent intent relating to the breaching of the contract and not merely to its making; and (3) a fraudulent act accompanying the breach.Â  Floyd v. Country Squire Mobile Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 51, 53-54, 336 S.E.2d 502, 503-04 (Ct. App. 1985).Â Â  â€œFraudulent intent is normally proved by circumstances surrounding the breach.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe fraudulent act may be prior to, contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the breach of contract, but it must be connected with the breach itself and cannot be too remote in either time or character.â€Â  Id. at 54, 336 S.E.2d at 504.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Armstrong, we find there was evidence that a contract was formed and, thus, both contract causes of action were properly submitted to the jury.Â  Collins maintained that the parties never had a meeting of the minds and that the only offer he ever made Armstrong was for ten percent of Collins Entertainment.Â  However, Armstrong and Youmans both testified that Collins offered to create a new entity unencumbered by the SouthTrust debt and that Armstrong would be a ten percent owner.Â  Armstrong further testified that he accepted Collinsâ€™ offer and procured the exclusive distribution agreements in reliance on the agreement.Â  The consideration for Collins was his agreement to capitalize the new business entity.Â  Armstrongâ€™s consideration was his agreement to continue working for Collins Entertainment while developing the new Skillpins product on his own time, despite his desire to go into business for himself.Â  \r\nBecause the evidence conflicted, a jury question existed as to whether a contract was formed.Â  Thus, the trial court properly denied the motion for a directed verdict and sent the two contract causes of action to the jury. \r\nD. Unenforceability of Contract\r\nCollins argues the trial court erred in failing to grant him a directed verdict as to all of Armstrongâ€™s causes of action because the alleged agreement was unenforceable.Â  He argues that he did not have the legal ability to enter into the alleged contract with Armstrong because any such agreement would unlawfully deprive SouthTrust Bank of its interest in its collateral.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, courts will not enforce contracts that are illegal or violate public policy.Â  See White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., Inc., 360 S.C. 366, 371, 601 S.E.2d 342, 345 (2004) (â€œThe general rule, well established in South Carolina, is that courts will not enforce a contract when the subject matter of the contract or an act required for performance violates public policy as expressed in constitutional provisions, statutory law, or judicial decisions.â€); see also Beach Co. v. Twillman, Ltd., 351 S.C. 56, 64, 566 S.E.2d 863, 866 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding that illegal contracts are void and unenforceable, such that actions for its breach may not be maintained).Â  However, we find this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\nIn arguing for a directed verdict as to the three fraud causes of action, Collinsâ€™ counsel argued that Armstrong had no right to rely because â€œthe question of whether this could, in fact, be done was a serious questionâ€ in light of the bank obligations.Â  Although counsel argued that Armstrong had no right to rely because he should have inquired about the bank obligations, Collinsâ€™ counsel did not argue, as he does in his appellate brief, that the contract was illegal and unenforceable because it violated SouthTrust Bankâ€™s security agreement.Â  Because this argument was not presented to the trial court in support of Collinsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict, the court was never given the opportunity to rule upon whether the agreement was unenforceable.Â  Accordingly, the matter is not preserved and we decline to address it.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that matters not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nE. Failure to Prove Damages\r\nCollins contends the trial court should have granted his motion for a directed verdict as to all causes of action because Armstrong failed to prove damages.Â  He argues that because Armstrong benefited from starting his own corporation after leaving Collins Entertainment, Armstrong cannot show that he sustained any damages from a breach of the alleged agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note Collins only moved for a directed verdict for failure to prove damages as to the claims for fraud, constructive fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, arguing that Armstrong failed to prove Skillpins was profitable and that Armstrong would have suffered no change in salary.Â  Thus, the argument Collins raises on appeal regarding the benefit to Armstrong from any alleged breach was never presented to the trial court.Â  Further, Collins never raised any argument before the trial court with regard to damages as to the breach of contract and breach of contract with fraudulent intent causes of action.Â  Accordingly, Collinsâ€™ current argument on appeal is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546; Gurganious v. City of Beaufort, 317 S.C. 481, 488, 454 S.E.2d 912, 916 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that a party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal).Â  \r\nAssuming the issue is preserved for our review, we find there was sufficient evidence of damages to submit the case to the jury.Â  In order for damages to be recoverable, the evidence should be sufficient to â€œenable the court or jury to determine the amount thereof with reasonable certainty or accuracy.â€Â  Whisenant v. James Island Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1981).Â  â€œWhile neither the existence, causation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess or speculation, proof with mathematical certainty of the amount of loss or damage is not required.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nArmstrong presented evidence of damages in the form of the loss of his salary and the loss of ten percent of Skillpinsâ€™ profits.Â  Evidence was presented that Armstrong was to receive a guaranteed yearly salary of $150,000, which he lost as a result of the breach.Â  At the time of the agreement, Armstrong expected to work approximately fourteen more years before retiring.Â  However, Armstrong retired shortly after starting his own corporation for health reasons.Â  Thus, Armstrong presented a range of damages from lost salary of $150,000 for one year of work up to $2.1 million over fourteen years.Â  \r\nArmstrong also presented evidence that Collinsâ€™ actions deprived him of the agreed-upon ten percent of the expected profits from Skillpins.Â  Armstrong and Collins planned to have 2,400 Skillpins machines in operation after two years.Â  The machines were eventually placed in the name of Collins Entertainment.Â  Skillpins machines accounted for about two-thirds of the corporationâ€™s revenue after their first full year of operation.Â  The 2001 gross profit from about 400 machines amounted to nearly $2.7 million, with a net profit of approximately $650,000.Â  Ten percent of the 2001 net profit would have amounted to $65,000.Â  Armstrong testified that when all 2,400 machines were in operation, the expected yearly gross profit would have been $16 million, and the net profit, around twenty percent of that, would have been $3.2 million.Â  Armstrong expected to share in ten percent of the net, or $320,000 per year, once the corporation installed all 2,400 machines.Â  Thus, Armstrong presented evidence of lost profits ranging from $65,000 per year up to $320,000 per year.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Armstrong, evidence was presented regarding damages from Collinsâ€™ actions.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly denied Collinsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict regarding lack of proof of damages.Â  Further, the juryâ€™s verdict of $1.8 million was declared a general verdict by the trial court and was well within the range of damages shown by Armstrong.Â  Because the verdict was a general verdict, we cannot now speculate as to how the jury allocated damages.Â  See Gold Kist , Inc. v. Citizens S. Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 286 S.C. 272, 282, 333 S.E.2d 67, 73 (Ct. App. 1985) (â€œThe appellate courts of this State exercise every reasonable presumption in favor of the validity of a general verdict.â€).\r\nII. Amendment and Request for Continuance\r\nCollins asserts the trial court erred in allowing Armstrong to amend his complaint to add causes of actions for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act and in refusing to grant a continuance or adjournment.Â Â Â  \r\nA.Â  Amendment of the Complaint\r\nCollins argues the trial court erred in allowing Armstrong to conduct the lawsuit based on the alleged fraudulent failure of Collins to create a contract and then amend the complaint on the theory that there was a contract.Â  We disagree. \r\nInitially, we note that Collins misconstrues Armstrongâ€™s complaint.Â  Rule 8, SCRCP allows inconsistent causes of action; however, we find nothing in the complaint that alleges Collins failed to create a contract.Â  To the contrary, paragraph 3 of the complaint avers â€œPlaintiff and Defendant agreed to the formation of a corporation . . . .â€Â  Paragraph 6 states â€œThe Plaintiff carried out his obligations;â€ and paragraph 8 avers â€œ. . . the Plaintiff had performed under the contract . . .â€ (emphasis added).Â  Thus, contrary to Collinsâ€™ allegation that Armstrong alleged no contract was formed in the complaint, Armstrong clearly alleges that the parties already had a contract.Â  \r\nIf a party seeks to amend his pleadings greater than thirty days after a responsive pleading has been filed, he may only do so by leave of the court or with express consent of the other parties.Â  Rule 15(a), SCRCP.Â  Leave to amend the pleadings â€œshall be freely given when justice so requires and does not prejudice any other party.â€Â  Id.Â  Amendments may also be made to conform the pleadings to the evidence when issues not pled are tried by express or implied consent of the parties.Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  However, implied consent will not be found if all the parties did not recognize it as an issue at trial, even if evidence in the record exists to support the amendment.Â  Dunbar v. Carlson, 341 S.C. 261, 268, 533 S.E.2d 913, 917 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œMotions to amend pleadings to conform to proof may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment . . . .â€Â  Ball v. Canadian Am. Express Co., 314 S.C. 272, 275, 442 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œAmendments to conform to the proof should be liberally allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result.â€Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 313, 566 S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002); Kelly v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 319, 323, 450 S.E.2d 59, 61 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding that amendments are to be freely granted when justice requires and there is no prejudice to any other party).Â  \r\nâ€œA motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.â€Â  Kelly, 316 S.C. at 323, 450 S.E.2d at 61.Â  The prejudice that Rule 15 contemplates is lack of notice that the new issue is to be tried and lack of a full opportunity to introduce testimony to refute it.Â  Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly Assoc., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nAlthough Armstrongâ€™s counsel believed that facts were alleged in the complaint to support the two contract causes of action, he moved, â€œout of an abundance of caution,â€ to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof presented at trial pursuant to Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  Despite Collinsâ€™ argument that the contract causes of action were never pled and he was prejudiced by the surprise amendment, the trial court found that the contract causes of action were an integral part of the case.Â  \r\nIn determining whether the amendment was proper pursuant to Rule 15(b), SCRCP, we must first address whether the issue of breach of contract was tried by express or implied consent of the parties. Â In Dunbar v. Carlson, 341 S.C. 261, 533 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 2000), this court analyzed implied consent to try a particular issue.Â  In that case, the plaintiff sued the defendant for dental malpractice, and the defendant cross-examined the plaintiffâ€™s daughter regarding the time period during which she warned her mother that the defendant was not giving her adequate care.Â  Based on the daughterâ€™s answers, the defendant moved to amend his pleadings to include the affirmative defense that the statute of limitations had run.Â  Although the plaintiff did not object to the daughterâ€™s testimony and was not aware of the defendantâ€™s intention, the trial court allowed the amendment and immediately granted the defendantâ€™s subsequent motion for a directed verdict.Â  This court reversed, holding that there was no implied consent to try the statute of limitations issue where the daughterâ€™s testimony was admissible for another purpose and she failed to recognize that the defendant intended to assert the statute of limitations.Â  Dunbar, 341 S.C. at 268, 533 SE.2d at 917.Â  \r\nAlthough Collins cites Dunbar in support of his argument, we believe the facts in this case are distinguishable.Â  In Dunbar, the plaintiff had concluded her case when a new affirmative defense was raised and directed verdict immediately granted.Â  In the case at bar, Armstrongâ€™s unamended complaint alleged â€œThe subject matter of this litigation involves contractual obligations . . . .â€Â  The complaint also alleged that the parties had a contract and that Armstrong performed under the contract.Â  Moreover, in his opening statement, Armstrongâ€™s counsel stated the case concerned whether or not there was a contract between Collins and Armstrong.Â  He informed the jury that it was their job to determine whether there was a meeting of the minds.Â  Although Armstrong testified he had a verbal agreement with Collins, Collinsâ€™ counsel cross-examined Armstrong regarding whether the agreement was actually just a promise to do something in the future.Â  Tim Youmans, an attorney who initially worked for Collins Entertainment and later worked for Armstrong in his new enterprise, testified that Collins informed him that Armstrong would get ten percent of a new corporation that would be a separate entity from Collins Entertainment and the SouthTrust debt.Â  Further, Collins had not begun his defense when the amendment was made.Â  \r\nWe find there is sufficient evidence in the record indicating the existence of a contract was an issue at trial.Â  Although Collinsâ€™ counsel noted early in the trial that the issue of breach of contract had not been pled in the case, he questioned Armstrong and Youmans about the particulars of any alleged agreement and whether it was an actual agreement or merely a promise to do something in the future.Â  Armstrong testified extensively that the parties entered into an oral agreement, he trusted Collins would fulfill his end of the bargain, and he would have ten percent of Skillpins, a corporation free and clear of the SouthTrust debt.Â  Thus, despite counselâ€™s assertions at trial that breach of contract was not an issue, both parties elicited testimony regarding a contract and the issue was tried by implied consent.Â  Because whether a contract existed was such an integral part of this case, we do not find that Collins was taken by surprise as was the plaintiff in Dunbar.\r\nWe next turn to whether Collins was prejudiced by the amendment.Â  In considering potential prejudice, the court should consider whether the opposing party has had the opportunity to prepare for the issue now being formally raised.Â  Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly Assoc., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987); see also Pool v. Pool, 329 S.C. 324, 328, 494 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1998) (citing Folly Assoc. for the premise that the prejudice contemplated by Rule 15, SCRCP, is the lack of opportunity to refute any new evidence connected with the amended complaint).Â  Armstrong moved for the amendment after presenting all the evidence in support of his case.Â  Collins objected to the amendment, arguing he was prejudiced because he did not have an opportunity to conduct discovery or to cross-examine Armstrong with the contract causes of action in mind.Â  The trial court granted leave to amend, finding that the existence of a contract was an integral part of this case.Â  The court gave Collins the option of recalling Armstrong for further cross-examination on the contract issue, however.Â  Although Collins failed to recall Armstrong for cross-examination, he presented testimony that: the parties never had a â€œmeeting of the minds;â€ there was never an agreement that Skillpins would be free from the SouthTrust debt; and Armstrong was only offered the gift of ten percent of Collins Entertainment.Â Â  \r\nAlthough Collins argued that he was prejudiced by the amendment because he would have asked different questions on cross-examination and would have presented different evidence, he made no proffer of different questions or evidence, and he was allowed to recall Armstrong if he wanted to do so.Â  We find, based on the facts of this case, that Collins failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice.Â  \r\nFurther, we find the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow the amendment was proper pursuant to Rule 15(a), SCRCP.[4]Â  Although Armstrongâ€™s pleadings did not separately delineate causes of action for breach of contract or breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, the facts in the pleadings alleged the following: (1) Armstrong and Collins had a special relationship in which Collins told Armstrong he could trust him; (2) Armstrong developed a business idea, and he and Collins agreed to the formation of a corporation to buy, sell, and distribute coin-operated machines; (3) the agreement between the parties was that Armstrong would receive ten percent of the newly-formed corporation plus a salary of $150,000 per year and that the new corporation would be separate from Collinsâ€™ other business entities and debts; (4) that Armstrong performed under the contract; and (5) notwithstanding the contract between the parties, Collins pledged the new corporation to the bank to secure debts for his other companies and appropriated Armstrongâ€™s idea as his own.Â  These factual allegations were sufficient to support a cause of action for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act.Â  Because the allegations were clearly in the pleadings and the issue of the existence of an agreement was addressed at the trial, we find no prejudice to Armstrong in the amendment.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court appropriately allowed the amendment.Â  \r\nIn sum, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the amendment.Â  Armstrongâ€™s complaint did not allege that Collins failed to create a contract, as Collins asserts.Â  Clearly, the existence of a contract was an issue at trial, and Collins was not prejudiced by the amendment.Â  Finally, Armstrongâ€™s complaint alleges facts that would support the causes of action for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act.\r\nB. Continuance\r\nCollins next asserts that even if the trial court properly granted leave to amend, it erred in refusing to continue or adjourn the case to give defense counsel time to prepare.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe decision whether to grant leave to amend is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly Assoc., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  However, when a late amendment would cause prejudice to the opposing party, the trial court should either deny the amendment or grant a continuance to allow the time reasonably necessary to prepare for the new issue.Â  Ball, 314 S.C. at 275, 442 S.E.2d at 622.Â  Nevertheless, the decision to grant or deny a continuance is a matter within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Graybar Elec. Co. v. Rice, 287 S.C. 518, 520, 339 S.E.2d 883, 884 (Ct. App. 1986).Â Â  \r\nAfter the trial court denied Collinsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict, he moved for a continuance or an adjournment of the trial, to â€œrestart it sometime in the future,â€ because he was taken by surprise that the contract causes of action would be a part of the trial.Â  The trial court found the contract issue so completely integral and intertwined with the other issues in the case that a continuance or adjournment was unnecessary in light of the need for judicial economy.Â  However, the court granted Collins the right to recall Armstrong as a witness at any point in the trial.Â  Collins never recalled Armstrong for further cross-examination.Â  \r\nMoreover, Collins had notice of an alleged contract and its breach from the moment he was served with the complaint.Â  He had ample time to conduct discovery and formulate questions on the issue.Â  Considering the theory of his defense â€“ that he only made a promise of a future gift â€“ it is highly unlikely that Collins did not contemplate the contract issue.Â  \r\nAs discussed above, Collins presented evidence in his case that there was no agreement.Â  Thus, he failed to show any actual prejudice from the courtâ€™s decision to allow the amendment.Â  Based on these facts, we find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s decision to deny the motion for a continuance at such a late date in the trial. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the trial court correctly denied Collinsâ€™ motion for directed verdict on all six remaining causes of action.Â  We further hold that the damages issue was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in allowing the amendment to the pleadings to include the contract causes of action and in denying the request for a continuance or adjournment.Â  Accordingly, the judgment in favor of Armstrong is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J. and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Collins was not personally liable on this debt.Â  \r\n[2] The goal was to have 2,400 machines in operation after the first two years.Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  Collins also mentions in his brief that there was â€œno evidence of any accompanying fraud.â€Â  However, he fails to present any argument or caselaw in support of this assertion.Â  Thus, this argument is abandoned on appeal and we decline to address it.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting that where a party fails to cite any supporting authority or where the argument is merely a conclusory statement, the issue is deemed abandoned on appeal).\r\n[4]Â  This court may affirm the trial court based on any grounds found in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR; Iâ€™on, LLC v.

Lund, III, of Bluffton, for Appellant.\r\nJohn J. Kerr, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â Â Â Â Â Â  This case involves a dispute to title of property.Â  Bernard Thomas Carlin, Jr. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding Russell B. Corbin held title to the property and voiding the tax sale of the property to Carlinâ€™s predecessor.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe property at issue is a long, narrow strip of land referred to by the parties as Tract B and is located on Yonges Island in Charleston County.Â  Tract B was 1.07 acres, was originally subdivided from a larger piece of property, and was deeded to Thompson Farms.Â  In March 1984, Thompson Farms conveyed Tract B to Henry Lowndes.Â  \r\nIn December 1985, Thompson Farms conveyed a 5.99-acre tract of land (â€œTract 1â€) to Russell Corbin.Â  The description of Tract 1 in the deed from Thompson Farms to Corbin described the parcel as including the 1.07 acres of Tract B.Â  At the time of this conveyance, Thompson Farms did not own Tract B.Â  However, two weeks later, in January 1986, Lowndes conveyed Tract B back to Thompson Farms.Â  These exchanges were part of a three-way exchange and sale involving Corbin, Thompson Farms, and Lowndes.Â  In the final part of this exchange, Thompson Farms deeded property known as Tract C to Lowndes that was bounded on the east by Tract B.Â  The description in the deed stated that it was bounded on the east by lands â€œrecently conveyed to Russell Corbin.â€Â Â  \r\nThe county listed Thompson Farms as the owner of Tract B, even though pursuant to the prior sale, Corbin owned Tract 1 that included Tract B in its 5.99 acres.Â  Corbin paid taxes on the entirety of Tract 1, which included Tract B.Â  Tract B was used by Corbin as an airstrip, and he leased use of the airstrip to Bernard Carlin from 1990 to 1995.Â  However, in 1990, the county mailed tax notices to Thompson Farms for Tract B.Â  Thompson Farms ignored these notices.Â  On July 6, 1992, Charleston County sold Tract B in a tax sale to James E. Peterson for $400.Â  He received the tax deed in August 1993.Â  Peterson later conveyed the property to Carlin in October 1997. \r\nCorbin eventually discovered that Tract B had been sold and then conveyed to Carlin.Â  In August 2001, he brought a declaratory judgment action against Carlin and Carlinâ€™s predecessor in title, Peterson.Â  The action sought to quiet title to Tract B and to have the tax sale, deed, and any mortgage on the property declared null and void.[1]Â  Carlin answered, denying the allegations in the complaint and asserting the two-year time limit found in section 12-51-160 of the South Carolina Code barred the action. \r\nAt trial, Corbin offered the testimony of Curtis Lybrand as a professional land surveyor.Â  He testified regarding the various transactions and the descriptions of the property.Â  He also testified if one researched the three-way deals, it would have placed the individual on notice that Corbin owned Tract B because at least one other deed description referred to the bordering land, Tract B, as belonging to Corbin.Â  He also testified Tract B as described in the tax deed to Peterson did not exist.Â  Finally, he testified the only property which was described as Tract B that he could locate was within Tract 1 and owned by Corbin at the time of the tax sale.Â  \r\nCarlin testified he did no research into what property he purchased from Peterson.Â  He testified in 1999 he purchased property from Lowndes to the west of Tract 1.Â  At the time of the survey, he also assumed Tract B was to the west of Tract 1 and not within its boundaries.Â  When the survey was complete he admitted to being shocked that the tax deed was for property within the land encompassed by Tract 1 and owned by Corbin.Â  \r\nAt the end of Corbinâ€™s case, Carlinâ€™s counsel stated:Â  â€œIâ€™d like to make a motion to dismiss.â€Â  The parties then discussed the ramifications of section 12-51-160 and whether the instant action was one to set aside a tax sale so as to fall within the sectionâ€™s purview.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  \r\nCarlin then called Peterson to the stand to offer testimony.Â  At the end of his case, Carlin again moved to dismiss the case, simply stating:Â  â€œAnd weâ€™ll rest the defense. . . . And renew our motion to dismiss.â€Â  The court made no explicit ruling on the motion, but it directed Corbinâ€™s counsel to draft a proposed order ruling in Corbinâ€™s favor.Â  \r\nIn the final order, the court found Corbin owned Tract B through the doctrine of after-acquired property.Â  The court then concluded the tax notices were in error and the tax sale and deed were null and void.Â  Finally, the court found Corbin the proper owner of Tract B.Â  The order failed to rule on the application of section 12-51-160 to the action.Â  \r\nCarlin filed a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The motion stated in part:Â  â€œGrounds therefore will be that the findings, conclusions, holdings, and judgment contained in the referenced Order [the courtâ€™s final order] are contrary to the record, without evidentiary support, and contrary to the statutory and case law of South Carolina, in such cases made and provided.â€Â  The motion never specifically asked the court to consider section 12-51-160 as barring the action.Â  The court denied the motion for reconsideration, again without mentioning section 12-51-160.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis is an appeal from a decision in a declaratory judgment action.Â  Declaratory judgments are neither legal nor equitable, but the nature of the action is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991); Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œAn action to remove a cloud on and quiet title to land is one in equity.â€Â  Bryan v. Freeman, 253 S.C. 50, 52, 168 S.E.2d 793, 793 (1969).Â  In actions at equity, tried before a judge alone, we are free to find the facts according to our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, the decision to grant a declaratory judgment is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Eargle v. Horry County, 344 S.C. 449, 453, 545 S.E.2d 276, 279 (2001). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCarlin contends the trial court erred in failing to find the action was barred under application of the time limit found in section 12-51-160 of the South Carolina Code.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note that the trial court found Corbin acquired title through the application of the doctrine of after-acquired property.Â  See Richardson v. Atlantic Coast Lumber Corp., 93 S.C. 254, 258, 75 S.E. 371, 372 (1912) (â€œThe principle is settled beyond controversy in this state that if a grantor conveys land, with the usual covenants of warranty, to which at that time he has no title, but afterwards acquires a title, he is estopped from claiming that he did not have title at the time of the sale; and the after-acquired title inures to the benefit of his grantee.â€).Â  The trial courtâ€™s determination that Corbin acquired Tract B through the doctrine of after-acquired property has not been appealed, and it is therefore the law of the case.Â  See Unisun Ins. v. Hawkins, 342 S.C. 537, 544, 537 S.E.2d 559, 563 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting an unappealed ruling is the law of the case which the appellate court must assume was correct).Â  Thus, we must determine the application of the statute to the situation where Corbin had good title to Tract B.Â  \r\nSection 12-51-160 provides that the tax sale deed is evidence of good title and that â€œall proceedings have been regular and that all legal requirements have been complied with.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-160 (2000).Â  The section further provides a time limit for recovering land sold pursuant to a tax sale:Â  â€œNo action for the recovery of land sold under the provisions of this chapter or for the recovery of the possession may be maintained unless brought within two years from the date of sale.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nTo determine the application of this section on the present case, we must apply the rules of statutory construction.Â  â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003); Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 739 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it reasonably can be discovered in the language used, and the language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck (VIN # JM2UF1132N0294812), 330 S.C. 371, 375, 498 S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€ Â TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â Â  \r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  â€œOur goal in construing statutes is to prevent an interpretation that would lead to a result that is plainly absurd.â€Â  In re Timothy C.M., 348 S.C. 653, 655-56, 560 S.E.2d 452, 453 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nWe find section 12-51-160 was not intended to bar an action under the circumstances of this case.Â  The legislature intended the statute to create a time limit during which one who lost title to property through a tax sale, after proper notice, may attempt to regain title.Â  In this case, Corbin never lost title to the property, as the tax sale should never have occurred.Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that Corbin properly paid taxes owed on Tract 1, which included Tract B.[3]Â  There is nothing in the record to indicate he was on notice that Thompson Farms received tax notices for Tract B or that Thompson Farms ignored those notices.Â  Because the taxes for Tract 1, including Tract B, were not delinquent, the county did not have any basis for conducting the tax sale on Tract B.Â Â  \r\nWe find the instant action was not one to set aside a tax sale falling under the provision of section 12-51-160, but instead was an action to quiet title and for Corbin to assert his proper ownership rights to Tract B.Â  It would yield an absurd and unfair result to forbid Corbin to assert his right to ownership of his property when there is no indication he knew or should have known the county was improperly seeking to sell the property in a tax sale.Â  The court properly found Corbin had title to Tract B.Â  It also properly found the county erred in conducting a tax sale.Â  The evidence indicates Corbin paid taxes assessed against Tract 1, which unquestionably included Tract B.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly refused to find, based upon the circumstances of this case, that the statute of limitations found in section 12-51-160 barred the action.\r\nConsidering the particular circumstances of this case, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant Corbinâ€™s declaratory judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the above, we hold section 12-51-160 did not bar the instant action to quiet title.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Corbin also brought an action seeking damages for slander of title, alleging Carlinâ€™s deed placed a cloud on his title.Â  The trial court denied Corbinâ€™s request for damages, finding no slander of title.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Carlin states the statute controlling the time during which challenges to tax sales may be made is a statute of repose.Â  The statute itself, however, is entitled â€œDeed as evidence of good title; statute of limitations.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-160 (2000).Â  The section appears to operate as a statute of repose, which creates â€œâ€˜a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a legislatively-determined period of time.â€™â€Â  Langley v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 403-04, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993) (quoting First United Methodist Church v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 882 F.2d 862, 866 (4th Cir. 1989)).Â  Whether the statute is one of limitations or one of repose, however, is not a question we must address in order to decide the issues on appeal.Â  Therefore, we decline to analyze it.Â  Because the statute is entitled â€œstatute of limitations,â€ we will refer to the statute as one of limitations for the sake of clarity.Â  \r\n[3] Carlin also alleges that the trial court erred in finding no taxes were delinquent on Tract B.Â  As previously discussed, it is the law of the case that Corbin obtained title to Tract B, as a part of Tract 1, through the doctrine of after-acquired property.Â  Carlin does not challenge evidence that Corbin paid the taxes owed on Tract 1.Â  Because Corbin was not delinquent on taxes owed on property that included Tract B, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s determination that no taxes were delinquent on Tract B. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4014","title":"State v.

Â Wharton resisted the attempts to calm him down and did not want to be touched.Â  At some point, he exchanged words with Shaw about Suber.Â  Wharton retrieved a gun from a vehicle parked nearby.Â  Shaw told his girlfriend to take his son home out of the way.Â  He then approached Wharton in an aggressive manner.Â  The two continued to argue.Â  Shaw placed his necklace beneath his shirt collar to prepare for a physical altercation and Wharton pulled the gun out.Â  According to Shaw, who was the object of the argument, Wharton pulled the gun out like he was trying to shoot it into the air.Â  Shaw testified that he turned and lay down, the gun discharged, and Luster, who was attempting to end the argument between Wharton and Shaw, was fatally shot.Â  A witness testified that Wharton was shocked that Luster was shot.Â  \r\nWharton was indicted for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  The State requested a jury charge on murder and voluntary manslaughter.Â  Wharton opposed the voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  He argued alternatively that if the judge gave the voluntary manslaughter charge, he was entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter and accident.Â  The judge denied the requests, and the jury was charged on the law of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.[1] Â The jury found Wharton guilty of voluntary manslaughter and possession of a weapon during the commission or attempt to commit a violent crime.Â  The judge sentenced him to prison for a total of fifteen years.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.â€Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  â€œOnly the law applicable to the case should be charged to the jury.â€Â  State v. Blurton, 352 S.C. 203, 208, 573 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002).Â  â€œIf a jury instruction is provided to the jury that does not fit the facts of the case, it may confuse the jury.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWharton argues the trial judge erred in charging the jury on voluntary manslaughter.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nVoluntary manslaughter is the â€œunlawful killing of a human being in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.â€Â  Knoten, 347 S.C. at 302, 555 S.E.2d at 394.Â  Both heat of passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present for the killing to constitute voluntary manslaughter.Â  Id.; State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 101-02, 525 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000).Â  Sufficient legal provocation must come from the victim, not from a third party.Â  Harris, 354 S.C. at 387, 581 S.E.2d at 156.Â  To constitute sufficient legal provocation to support a voluntary manslaughter charge, the provocation â€œmust come from some act of or related to the victim.â€Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 363, 535 S.E.2d 420, 425 (2000).Â  \r\nWe find no evidence of sufficient legal provocation that would support a charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  The pertinent facts are undisputed as to the lack of provocation by the victim, Chris Luster.Â  Although Wharton was arguing with Shaw at the time of the shooting, the evidence elicited at trial showed there was never any argument or discord between Wharton and Luster.Â  \r\nThe State argues, however, that the principle of transferred intent is applicable.Â  This argument is unavailing.Â  As previously discussed, sufficient provocation necessary to justify a voluntary manslaughter charge must come from the victim and not transferred from a third party.Â  Harris, 354 S.C. at 387, 581 S.E.2d at 156; Locklair, 341 S.C. at 363, 535 S.E.2d at 425.Â  Further, â€œ[w]here death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon, words alone, however opprobrious, are not sufficient to constitute a legal provocation.â€Â  State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 322, 474 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1996); State v. Cooley, 342 S.C. 63, 68, 536 S.E.2d 666, 669 (2000).Â  Here, Wharton and Shaw were only arguing.Â  Thus, there was no legal provocation to transfer.Â  Moreover, transferred intent does not supplant the necessary element of legal provocation required for voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nBecause there is no evidence of sufficient legal provocation, the trial judge should not have given a voluntary manslaughter instruction.Â  Wharton was clearly prejudiced because he was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, we reverse Whartonâ€™s conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nFurther, Whartonâ€™s conviction for voluntary manslaughter was a prerequisite to his conviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(E) (2003) (noting that the additional punishment for possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime may not be imposed unless the defendant is convicted of the underlying violent crime); State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 235 n.4, 589 S.E.2d 1, 5 n.4 (2003) (noting that defendantâ€™s conviction for possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime must be reversed where the court was reversing defendantâ€™s murder conviction).Â  Thus, because we reverse the voluntary manslaughter conviction, we necessarily must reverse the conviction for the weapon charge.\r\nHaving reversed the trial court on the voluntary manslaughter charge, we need not address appellantâ€™s remaining issues.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the trial judge erred in charging the law of voluntary manslaughter, Whartonâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In fact, the jury was charged twice with the law of voluntary manslaughter because the jury requested the definition of manslaughter and asked whether involuntary manslaughter was an option.Â  The jury was also charged three times with the law of transferred intent after the jury requested a clarification and a question arose regarding whether or not transferred intent could be used for voluntary manslaughter.Â  See Harris v. State, 354 S.C. 382, 387, 581 S.E.2d 154, 156 (2003) (â€œSufficient provocation necessary to justify a voluntary manslaughter charge must come from the victim and not be transferred from a third party to the victim.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4030","title":"Blackmon v.

Michael Brackett, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAdele Jeffords Pope, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Lana Blackmon, the personal representative and a beneficiary under her late husbandâ€™s will, requested the probate court to construe the will.Â  After removal to the circuit court, the judge construed the will to grant Lana an estate less than one for life and removed her as personal representative.Â  Lana appeals, and we reverse. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nJ.B. Blackmon and Lana Odom were married in February 2000 after a courtship lasting approximately six years.Â  It was J.B.â€™s fourth marriage and Lanaâ€™s third.Â  Prior to the marriage, J.B. had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and in February of 2001, he died.Â  J.B.â€™s will named Lana personal representative and devised to her an interest in the estate.Â  The will also devised interests to J.B.â€™s three children from his first marriage, Jennifer Weaver, Mary Heath, and J.B. Blackmon, III.Â  The nature of the partiesâ€™ interests in the estate property is at the heart of this action.Â  J.B.â€™s will reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nSecond:Â  I give, devise and bequeath all of my property whether real, personal or mixed, whatsoever and wheresoever situate, whether now owned by me or to me or hereafter acquired by me, to my wife, Lana Odom Blackmon for and during her natural life or until such time as she no longer desires the property.\r\nSixth:Â  That if the desire of my wife to sell any or all of my property and assets then my wife,\r\nMary&nbsp;B. Heath, J.B. Blackmon, III and Jennifer B. Weaver, shall share equally in the sale of such assets or proceeds from the sale of such assets. \r\n\r\nLana argues she has a life estate in all of J.B.â€™s property pursuant to these provisions.Â  The children take the position that J.B.â€™s devise does not permit Lana to dispose of some of the assets, specifically the family farm and certain stocks.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to construe a will is an action at law.Â  NationsBank of S.C. v. Greenwood, 321 S.C. 386, 392, 468 S.E.2d 658, 662 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  An action to remove a personal representative is equitable in nature.Â  Dean v. Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257, 259, 437 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  When legal and equitable causes of action are maintained in one suit, the court is presented with a divided scope of review.Â  Perry v. Heirs at Law and Distributees of Gadsden, 313 S.C. 296, 300 n.3, 437 S.E.2d 174, 177 n.3 (Ct. App. 1993) (affâ€™d as modified, 316 S.C. 224, 449 S.E.2d 250 (1994)).Â  On appeal from an action at law that was tried without a jury, the appellate court can correct errors of law, but the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assoc. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  In an equitable action tried without a jury, the appellate court can correct errors of law and may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775-76.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Will Construction\r\nLana argues the trial court erred in construing the will to grant her a limited right of use and enjoyment in the family farm and related personal property.Â  We agree.\r\nLana requests that this court construe her interest as a life estate with the power of disposition.Â  Our courts have previously recognized such an interest.Â  See Johnson v. Waldrop, 256 S.C. 372, 374-76, 182 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1971) (finding a life estate with a complete power to dispose and consume); Thomason v. Hellams, 233 S.C. 11, 15, 103 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1958) (holding that â€œ[a] deed, devise or bequest for life with power of disposition and remainder to another (of such property as is not disposed of by the first taker) is valid.â€).Â  In this case, the trial court took a clear provision of the will creating a life estate and then reduced it by construing the language of a subsequent provision.Â  We refuse to do so.Â  \r\nItem two reads as follows:Â  â€œI give, devise and bequeath all of my property . . . to my wife . . . for and during her natural life.â€Â  These words clearly indicate J.B.â€™s intent to give a life estate in all of his property to Lana.Â  Where the wording of a will is clear and unambiguous, the testatorâ€™s intention must be ascertained from the language utilized.Â  Shelley v. Shelley, 244 S.C. 598, 602, 137 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1964).Â  There is no special language required for the creation of a life estate; courts will look to the intention of the creator of the estate.Â  See 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estates Â§ 67 (2005).Â  The trial court, relying on the limiting language â€œor until such time as she no longer desires the property,â€ determined that J.B. granted Lana only the limited right of use and enjoyment to the property.Â  However, we do not believe this was a correct application of the law.Â  â€œ[W]here an estate or interest is given in words of clear and ascertained legal signification, it shall not be enlarged, cut down, or destroyed by superadded words in the same or subsequent clauses, unless they raise an irresistible inference that such was the intention.â€Â  McGirt v. Nelson, 360 S.C. 307, 311, 599 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nJ.B.â€™s intent is further evidenced by an examination of item six.Â  Item six unequivocally grants Lana the authority to dispose of the entirety of the estateâ€™s assets subject to J.B.â€™s children receiving a portion of the proceeds of any sale.Â  To hold, in the face of this language, that Lana was not given the right to dispose of the property would require us to completely ignore this provision as it is written.Â  To do so would be error.Â  See Hays v. Adair, 267 S.C. 291, 296, 227 S.E.2d 665, 667-68 (1976) (stating that â€œ[a] proper construction seeks to harmonize the various provisions and a construction which gives meaning to all should be preferred over one which renders some provisions meaningless.â€); see also May v. Riley, 279 S.C. 248, 250-51, 305 S.E.2d 77, 78 (1983) (considering two provisions and concluding that neither can be ignored).Â Â  \r\nA court may not â€œby judicial construction make a will for the decedent that he has not made for himself.â€Â  Guaranty Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Byrd, 287 S.C. 96, 99, 337 S.E.2d 231, 233 (Ct. App. 1985) (quoting Coffman v. Coffman, 85 Va. 459, 466, 8 S.E. 672, 675 (1888)), revâ€™d on other grounds, 292 S.C. 187, 355 S.E.2d 529 (1986).Â  Because the language of J.B.â€™s will clearly shows his intent to grant his wife a life estate with the power of disposition, we reverse the ruling of the trial court.Â  \r\nII.Â  Removal of Personal Representative\r\nLana also argues the trial court erred in removing her as personal representative.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 62-3-611(b) of the South Carolina Code (1976) governs removal of a personal representative, and allows for removal when it is in the best interest of the estate, when the personal representative mismanages the estate, or when the personal representative fails to perform any duty pertaining to the office.Â  However, there is a strong deference shown to the personal representative chosen by the testator.Â  â€œThe Courts have ever been reluctant to take the management of an estate from those to whom it has been confided by the testator, for to that extent the intention expressed in his will would be defeated.â€Â  Smith v. Heyward, 115 S.C. 145, 164, 105 S.E. 275, 282 (1920).Â  The power to remove a personal representative â€œshould be executed with great caution, and not at all, unless it is made to appear to be necessary for the protection of the estate, to prevent loss or injury to it from misappropriation, maladministration or fraud.â€Â  Id. at 164-65, 105 S.E. at 282. \r\nThe trial court removed Lana as personal representative because she requested the court to construe the will and took a position that strongly favored her own interests.Â  The court also cited Lanaâ€™s failure to timely act to collect a $70,000 debt owed to the estate and her hostility toward other beneficiaries.Â  The trial court found this hostility was displayed by failing to allow access to the family house and farm.Â  \r\nA review of the record shows Lana had, in fact, disclosed the existence of the debt on the estate inventory.Â  In addition, Lana was in the process of obtaining a default judgment against the debtor, which would allow her to proceed with collection efforts on behalf of the estate.Â  As for any failure to timely obtain the judgment, Lana testified she talked to approximately six attorneys regarding the debt and found it difficult to obtain anyone to represent the estate in the action.Â  Therefore, it appears that Lana has neither mismanaged the estate nor failed to perform a required duty.\r\nRegarding hostility between Lana and other beneficiaries, Lana admits she ceased talking to Jennifer Weaver because of conflict between the two.Â  However, it is uncontested that on one occasion Lana allowed the children to walk through the house and take some items.Â  Later, Lana delivered other items to one of the daughters.Â  The mere existence of conflict between a personal representative and a beneficiary is an inadequate reason for removal of the personal representative.Â  Without a showing of fault, the court will not remove a personal representative simply because the parties do not get along.Â \r\nReed v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 293 S.C. 357, 360 S.E.2d 527 (Ct. App. 1987) (discussing a trustee rather than a personal representative).Â  Therefore, we find the trial court erred in ordering the removal of Lana as personal representative.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the plain language of the will grants a life estate with the right of disposition, and because the request to remove the personal representative was without merit, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\nSHORT, J., dissents in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJ. Short, dissenting in part:&nbsp; Although I agree with the majority that the trial court erred in removing Lana as personal representative, I disagree with the majority&rsquo;s determination of Lana&rsquo;s interest and find that J.B. intended for her to have a life estate in all of his property.&nbsp; Furthermore, I believe he intended for her to have the power to sell any property not otherwise described specifically in paragraphs three and five of the will; however, should she sell any of the remaining assets she should share the proceeds as provided for in the will.&nbsp; Although the will is inadequately drawn, my construction would attempt to harmonize its provisions and give somewhat equivalent effect to each provision so as to effectuate J.B.&rsquo;s intent.&nbsp; \r\nLana requests this court to construe her interest as a life estate because our courts have previously recognized a grantee may have a life estate coupled with the power to dispose.&nbsp; See Johnson v. Waldrop, 256 S.C. 372, 375, 182 S.E.2d 730, 731 (1971) (finding a life estate with a complete power to dispose and consume); Thomason v. Hellams, 233 S.C. 11, 15, 103 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1958).&nbsp; In Johnson and Thomason, separate provisions in each will clearly created the life estates with the power to dispose while in the instant case, this court would have to take an ordinarily clear and separate provision of the will and limit it by a subsequent provision to construe such an interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;In determining the testator&rsquo;s intent, the [c]ourt should read the will as a whole and attempt to harmonize all its provisions.&rdquo;&nbsp; May v. Riley, 279 S.C. 248, 250, 305 S.E.2d 77, 78 (1983).&nbsp; &ldquo;An interpretation that fits into the whole scheme or plan of the will is the most apt to be the correct interpretation of the intent of the testator.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kemp v. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 34, 594 S.E.2d 845, 849 (2004).&nbsp; \r\nThe court&rsquo;s primary purpose when construing a will is to consider the will as a whole and arrive at the testator&rsquo;s intention.&nbsp; Shelley v. Shelley, 244 S.C. 598, 601, 137 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1964).&nbsp; This court must determine from paragraphs two, three, five, and six of J.B.&rsquo;s will what type of estate J.B. granted to Lana.[1]&nbsp; The lower court determined the will&rsquo;s language limited Lana&rsquo;s interest to &ldquo;her natural life or until such time as she no longer desires the property.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the court granted Lana a limited right of use and enjoyment, a plain reading of paragraph two clearly indicates J.B. intended to give Lana a life estate in all of his property.&nbsp; There is no special language required for the creation of a life estate and courts look to the intention of the creator of the estate.&nbsp; See 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estates &sect; 67 (2000).&nbsp; The &ldquo;for and during her natural life&rdquo; language attests to J.B.&rsquo;s intent to create a life estate in favor of his wife.&nbsp; \r\nParagraph three, which begins with the word &ldquo;[t]hen,&rdquo; indicates J.B.&rsquo;s desire for his daughter Jennifer to follow Lana&rsquo;s interest in the family farm after Lana dies or no longer desires the property.&nbsp; A plain reading of paragraph three presents the probability that J.B. contemplated that he was arranging for Lana to remain on the property, which in fact was the marital home, until she no longer desired to live there.&nbsp; Should that time come before her death, it is reasonable to assume that he provided that it should then pass to his daughter, rather than Jennifer having to wait until Lana&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; More explicitly, paragraph three grants Nicolas Weaver, Jennifer&rsquo;s son, the property if Jennifer &ldquo;is deceased at the time of the death of my wife or at the time my wife desires to no longer use the property . . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; This statement signifies the unmistakable intent on the part of J.B. for the farm to remain in the family by contemplating no scenario for the transfer of the farm beyond the death or voluntary surrender by Lana by deeming it to pass to not one, but to a second generational heir, should the first bequest fail.&nbsp; \r\nParagraph five grants Mary Heath and J.B. Blackmon, III, J.B.&rsquo;s other children, an interest in the PLM partnerships and uses identical language as paragraph three as to when they take the property.&nbsp; The &ldquo;no longer desires the property&rdquo; language in paragraphs three and five underscores J.B.&rsquo;s desire for his children to receive his interest in the partnerships at the time of Lana&rsquo;s death or when she no longer desired the property. \r\nParagraph six creates the problematic portion of the will by providing for proceeds distribution should Lana desire &ldquo;to sell any or all of my property and assets.&rdquo; (emphasis added).&nbsp; Read alone, paragraph six grants Lana the authority to dispose of the entirety of the estate&rsquo;s assets unconditionally, subject to J.B.&rsquo;s children receiving a portion of the proceeds of any sale.&nbsp; If allowed such weight and analyzed with the entire will, paragraph six seems to limit taking of the interests in paragraphs three and five by the cited beneficiaries to two scenarios: Lana dying before selling the property or Lana voluntarily relinquishing her rights to the property during her lifetime.&nbsp; A fundamental rule of construction of wills is that the court makes every effort to give effect to every provision of the will and endeavors to reconcile two apparently inconsistent provisions rather than to give effect to one over the other.&nbsp; Shelley, 244 S.C. at 601-03, 137 S.E.2d. at 853.&nbsp; Under this analysis, Lana&rsquo;s decision to sell the farm would reduce Jennifer&rsquo;s potential interest in the farm from fee simple to a mere shared portion of the proceeds.&nbsp; The clear intent of paragraph three belies this result, and I do not believe J.B. intended paragraph six to supersede the other paragraphs of the will.\r\nThe lower court heard testimony that the farmhouse was built in 1822 and had been bought by J.B.&rsquo;s grandfather in 1937.&nbsp; J.B. grew up on the farm, known as &ldquo;White Plains&rdquo; from the time he was ten years old and after he returned to live there, he worked to place the house on the National Register of Historic Places.&nbsp; The record is clear and both sides agree that J.B. had a great deal of fondness for the property; therefore, I find that he did not intend to give Lana the power to dispose of White Plains.&nbsp; I find J.B. included paragraph six in the will to permit Lana to sell various assets for her support as needed, but I believe J.B. did not contemplate the sale of either the PLM partnerships or White Plains to satisfy this commitment.\r\n\r\n[1] In addition to the second and sixth paragraphs of the will referred to in the majority opinion, J.B.&rsquo;s will provides, in pertinent part:\r\nThird:&nbsp; Then I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter, Jennifer B. Weaver, my farm and home and all personal property held for the benefit of such real property.&nbsp; If Jennifer B. Weaver, is deceased at the time of the death of my wife or at the time my wife desires to no longer use the property, then to Edwin Cole Weaver as Trustee for my grandson, Nicolas Weaver to be held until he reaches the age of eighteen (18) and then conveyed to him as Tenants in Common.&nbsp; \r\n. . . .\r\nFifth:&nbsp; Also at the time of the death of my wife or at such time as she no longer desires the property, I give and bequeath to my children, Mary B. Heath, and J.B. Blackmon, III, all of my interest in PLM V and VI including any earnings or cash attached to such interest along with such principal which may arise at maturity.&nbsp; If either of my children predecease my wife at the time of her death or when she no longer desires this property then the remainder shall be divided between the surviving child and Jennifer B. Weaver.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4031","title":"Browning v.

Saleeby, Sr., of Florence and Marian D. Nettles, of Lake City; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  In this domestic contempt action, Gregory W. Browning (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order, arguing the court erred in:Â  (1) finding Husband in contempt for failing to timely comply with the partiesâ€™ Property Settlement Agreement; (2) ordering Husband to submit to a medical examination so that Rhonda W. Browning (Wife) could obtain a life insurance policy on Husband; (3) addressing issues regarding a life insurance policy for the benefit of the partiesâ€™ emancipated son; and (4) awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and modify in part.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married on August 16, 1975, and had one child during the marriage. Â On September 15, 2000, the parties separated.Â  Prior to a hearing for temporary relief, the parties entered into a Property Settlement Agreement (Agreement) on March 7, 2001.Â  By order dated May 29, 2001, the family court approved the Agreement.Â  The parties were later divorced on July 8, 2002. \r\nOn February 2, 2004, Wife filed an action seeking to hold Husband in contempt for violating the Agreement.Â  In her amended complaint, Wife alleged, inter alia, Husband:Â  (1) failed to pay Wife her one-half share of the equity in the former marital home within thirty days of Wife vacating the home; (2) refused to submit to a medical examination in order that Wife could obtain a life insurance policy on Husband; and (3) failed to provide proof of coverage to Wife regarding a $2,000,000 life insurance policy for the benefit of the partiesâ€™ emancipated son.Â  In conjunction with these assertions, Wife also requested Husband pay her attorneyâ€™s fees as well as interest for the seven-month period that Husband delayed in paying her share of the former marital home.Â  In his Answer, Husband denied the allegations and sought, as a counterclaim, for the court to find Wife in contempt for failing to comply with several provisions of the Agreement.\r\nAfter a hearing, the family court issued an order in which it:Â  (1) found Husband failed to pay Wife, within the prescribed thirty-day period, her one-half interest in the former marital home; (2) ordered Husband to pay twelve percent interest for the seven-month period that he delayed in paying Wife her $175,000 share; (3) ordered Husband to submit to a medical examination so that Wife could procure a life insurance policy on Husband; (4) ordered Husband to provide proof of insurance coverage in which he indicated that the partiesâ€™ emancipated son was the beneficiary of a $2,000,000 life insurance policy; and (5) awarded Wife attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $2,700.[2]Â  Husband appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Contempt\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding him in contempt and awarding Wife twelve percent interest for the seven months he delayed in paying Wife her interest in the marital home.Â  Although Husband admits that he failed to timely pay Wife her share, he contends the seven-month delay was not willful given Wife created the delay.Â  Specifically, he claims he was unable to immediately refinance the mortgage with which to pay Wife because, unbeknownst to him, Wife opened several credit accounts in his name.Â  Husband asserts financing was not approved until these accounts were resolved and Wife completed information required for refinancing.Â  \r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€Â  In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998).Â  Contempt results from a partyâ€™s willful disobedience of a court order. Â Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2004) (A party may be found in contempt of court for the willful violation of a lawful court order.).Â  â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)).Â  â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€Â \r\nWidman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€Â  Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€Â  Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Henderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994). â€œEven though a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.â€Â  Hawkins, 359 S.C. at 503, 597 S.E.2d at 900.Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€Â  Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nWe find the family court did not abuse its discretion in holding Husband in contempt.Â  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Wife was permitted to reside in the marital home until the partiesâ€™ son enrolled in college.Â  Wife then had thirty days to vacate the home.Â  At that point, Husband was given the option of purchasing Wifeâ€™s one-half share of the equity in the marital home.Â  On January 1, 2002, Husband informed Wife that he intended to exercise this option.Â  In compliance with the Agreement, Wife vacated the marital home on September 17, 2002.Â  Thus, Husband was required to pay Wife her $175,000 equity share by October 17, 2002.Â  Husband did not, however, pay Wife until approximately seven months later on May 16, 2003. \r\nAlthough Husband violated the Agreement by failing to strictly comply with the thirty-day time period, we find Husband did not willfully cause the entire seven-month delay.Â  Husbandâ€™s mortgage broker testified Husband initiated the process to refinance the marital home in 2002.Â  He further testified there was a â€œshort delayâ€ in the process due to Husbandâ€™s credit score, which had been adversely affected by accounts Wife had apparently opened without Husbandâ€™s knowledge.Â  Additionally, he stated the remaining delay resulted because Wife did not sign over title to the property for several months after the quitclaim deed to the home was sent to her attorneyâ€™s office.Â  He testified the deed was sent to her attorney in October or November of 2002 and was returned to Husband in February 2003.Â  He stated there was no explanation for this delay and that the refinancing loan went through within three and a half weeks after the deed was received.Â  Wife also did not offer any explanation for the delay.\r\nBecause Wife did not expeditiously sign and return the quitclaim deed, we find Husband should not be penalized for the time period preceding his receipt of the deed in February 2003.Â  Accordingly, we modify the family courtâ€™s order and award Wife interest in the amount of $5,250, which represents the three-month delay between February 2003 and May 2003.[3]Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Life Insurance\r\nA.\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in requiring him to submit to a medical examination in order that Wife could obtain a life insurance policy on his life.Â  Because Wifeâ€™s right to alimony had ended and all of the partiesâ€™ property claims had been settled, Husband asserts Wife no longer has an insurable interest in his life.Â  Thus, he contends he should not be forced to assist Wife in procuring the life insurance policy.Â  We find the court erred as a matter of law.\r\nâ€œWhether a property settlement agreement should be deemed to bar the divorced wife from receiving insurance benefits is a question of the construction of the agreement itself.â€ Estate of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 477, 484 S.E.2d 112, 116 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  When parties merge their settlement agreement into a decree, the family court transforms it from a contract between the parties to a decree of the court.Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 214, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThereafter, the agreement, as part of the court order, is fully subject to the family courtâ€™s authority to interpret and enforce its own decrees.â€ Id. at 214, 603 S.E.2d at 601-02.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn order to analyze this issue, we must consider the controlling provision of the Agreement within the context of general insurance law regarding an insurable interest.Â  The Agreement states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe husband and wife each grant to the other the right to maintain an insurable interest insuring the others [sic] life.Â  [Husband] has the right to insure [Wifeâ€™s] life he shall own the policy and be responsible for paying all the premiums.Â  [Wife] likewise may insure [Husbandâ€™s] life she will likewise own the policy and she will be responsible for the premiums.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what is required to obtain a policy of insurance, our appellate courts have stated:\r\n\r\nIn this country, it is a rule of law that one cannot insure for his own benefit the property of another in which he has no interest.Â  Insurance law accepts as a settled rule that an insured must possess an interest of some kind in the subject matter of the policy . . . . In order to recover on a policy of insurance, the insured must prove an insurable interest in the property both at the time the policy is issued and becomes effective and at the time of the loss.\r\n\r\nPowell v. Insurance Co. of N. America, 285 S.C. 588, 589-90, 330 S.E.2d 550, 551-52 (Ct. App. 1985)(citations omitted); see Warren v. Pilgrim Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., 217 S.C. 453, 456, 60 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1950)(â€œ[O]ne cannot obtain valid insurance upon the life of another in whom he has no insurable interest.â€).Â  Where an insurable interest does not exist at the time the contract for insurance was made, the insurance contract is void from its inception. Abraham v. New York Underwriters Ins. Co., 187 S.C. 70, 78, 196 S.E. 531, 534 (1938).Â  Additionally, this court has stated:\r\n\r\nPolicies will be maintained where it is clear that the party insured had an interest which would be injured in the event the peril insured against should happen.Â  It is not necessary to constitute an insurable interest that the interest be such that the event insured against would necessarily subject the insured to loss; it is sufficient that it might do so, and that pecuniary injury would be the natural consequence.\r\n\r\nBenton &amp; Rhodes, Inc. v. Boden, 310 S.C. 400, 404, 426 S.E.2d 823, 826 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nAn â€œinsurable interestâ€ has been defined as follows:\r\nIt may be said, generally, that any one [sic] has an insurable interest in property who derives a benefit from its existence or would suffer loss from its destruction.Â  An insurable interest in property is any right, benefit or advantage arising out of or dependent thereon, or any liability in respect thereof, or any relation to or concern therein of such a nature that it might be so affected by the contemplated peril as to directly damnify the insured.\r\n\r\nBenton, 310 S.C. at 403, 426 S.E.2d at 825 (quoting Crook v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 175 S.C. 42, 48, 178 S.E. 254, 257 (1935)); see Hack v. Metz, 173 S.C. 413, 418, 176 S.E. 314, 316 (1934)(â€œA person can have no insurable interest where his only right arises under a contract which he had no authority to make.â€).Â  â€œAn insurable interest is in the nature of an inchoate right, everpresent [sic] for perfection in those who possess the right, but never perfected until all legal requirements have been performed.â€Â  Ramey v. Carolina Life Ins. Co., 244 S.C. 16, 20, 135 S.E.2d 362, 364 (1964) (citation omitted).\r\nWhen the parties entered into the Agreement, Wife was entitled to twenty-four months of alimony.Â  Because Wife was receiving alimony, she had an insurable interest in Husbandâ€™s life.Â  See Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 548, 615 S.E.2d 98, 106 (2005) (â€œIt is a settled proposition of law that a former wife who is entitled to alimony has an insurable interest in her former husbandâ€™s life.Â  The parties in a divorce proceeding may agree, in a private agreement subsequently merged into the courtâ€™s order, that a payor spouse shall maintain life insurance to secure an award of alimony.â€)(citation omitted).Â  However, once this obligation ended, Wife no longer had an insurable interest nor, can we discern from the record, a pecuniary interest.[4]Â  See Roberts v. Southwestern Life Ins. Co., 244 S.W.2d 302, 307 (Tex. Civ. App. 1951) (recognizing â€œupon divorce and termination of insurable interest, a policy cannot be beneficially owned by one divorced spouse on life of the other on basis of past relationshipâ€).\r\nSignificantly, this case does not present a scenario where Husband seeks to eliminate Wife as a beneficiary for an existing policy.Â  Instead, Wife is attempting to obtain a new life insurance policy on Husband after his financial obligation to her has ceased.Â  Cf. Estate of Revis, 326 S.C. at 477, 484 S.E.2d at 116 (â€œAlthough a divorce does not itself affect a beneficiaryâ€™s right to insurance proceeds, it is generally recognized that a beneficiary may contract this right away through a separation or property settlement agreement, even if the beneficiary designation is not formally changed.â€); Duncan v. Investors Diversified Servs., Inc., 285 S.C. 467, 470, 330 S.E.2d 295, 296 (1985) (stating â€œdivorce does not of itself operate to defeat the beneficiaryâ€™s claimâ€); Hughes v. Scholl, 900 S.W.2d 606, 607 (Ky. 1995) (recognizing â€œdivorce alone does not disturb a former spouseâ€™s status as an insurance policy beneficiaryâ€).\r\nFurthermore, we believe ordering Husband to submit to a medical examination against his will, i.e., forcing him to consent, where there is no insurable interest would violate public policy.Â  See Ramey, 244 S.C. at 22, 135 S.E.2d at 365 (It is well settled that â€œ[a] policy of insurance taken out on the life of another without his knowledge or consent is void and against public policy in that it might be a fruitful source of crime.â€)(emphasis added); Hack, 173 S.C. at 418, 176 S.E. at 316 (â€œIt has been broadly stated that insurance taken out on the life of another, without the latterâ€™s consent is against public policy and void.â€)(citation omitted).\r\nAdditionally, we reject Wifeâ€™s assertion that Husband consented to a perpetual insurable interest by entering into the Agreement.Â  See Abraham, 187 S.C. at 78, 196 S.E. at 534 (recognizing â€œ[n]either the doctrine of waiver nor the doctrine of estoppel can be invoked to give legalityâ€ to a contract where there exists no insurable interest, and thus, is absolutely null and void from its inception).\r\nBecause Wife lacked an insurable interest, we find ordering Husband to consent to a medical examination would violate public policy.Â  Accordingly, we hold the family court erred regarding the life insurance policy for the benefit of Wife.Â  See Elmore v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, 187 S.C. 504, 508-09, 198 S.E. 5, 7 (1938) (â€œOne cannot, by his own act, procure a valid enforceable policy of insurance for his own benefit upon the life of another in which he has no insurable interest; that such a contract of insurance is void in its inception and unenforceable on grounds of public policy, being a mere wagering contract.â€)(citation omitted); Henderson v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, 176 S.C. 100, 113-14, 179 S.E. 680, 685-86 (1935)(â€œThe law does not allow one who has no insurable interest in the life of another, to insure it for his benefit, for the reason that it is a mere wager and holds out a temptation to fraud, the insurer having no interest in the life of the assured and having a direct interest in his death.â€) (citations omitted).Â  Once the obligation of support is extinguished there is no insurable interest of right and the acquisition of any new insurance policy must be with the consent of the insured spouse or former spouse. \r\nB.\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in ordering additional requirements for the life insurance policy on Husbandâ€™s life for the benefit of the partiesâ€™ emancipated son.\r\nAs evidenced by the terms of the Agreement, Husband owned a $2,000,000 life insurance policy issued on March 3, 1993, which designated the partiesâ€™ son as the beneficiary.Â  The Agreement further provided that Husband was required to provide Wife with written documentation verifying that son remained as beneficiary.Â  In her contempt action, Wife requested the family court order Husband to provide her with proof of coverage and beneficiary designation.Â  She also sought proof that Husbandâ€™s cash withdrawal from the policy had not reduced the face amount.Â  In ruling on this issue, the family court held that Wife could request, and Husband must provide, verification of insurance coverage and beneficiary designation at reasonable periodic intervals.Â  The court also limited Husband to a total of $295,826 in withdrawals from this policy and further found the policy should remain in effect with no time limitations.Â  \r\nWe find, and Wife concedes, the court granted relief beyond that which was requested in Wifeâ€™s pleadings.Â  During the hearing, Husband informed the court that the $2,000,000 life insurance policy was still in effect and the partiesâ€™ son was the designated beneficiary.Â  Because this information sufficiently satisfied the relief Wife requested in her pleadings, the courtâ€™s additional rulings regarding the policy constituted error.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the court with respect to ordering Husband:Â  (1) to maintain the policy in apparent perpetuity; (2) to provide Wife or the son continuing coverage and beneficiary information; and (3) to limit his cash withdrawals from the policy.Â  See Bass v. Bass, 272 S.C. 177, 180, 249 S.E.2d 905, 906 (1978) (holding the family court cannot award relief that is not contemplated by the pleadings). \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nFinally, Husband asserts the family court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  He argues the award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be vacated if this court rules in his favor on the issues that he has raised on appeal.\r\nâ€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€ Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  The factors the family court should consider in awarding reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs include:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nAlthough we have ruled in favor of Husband on several issues, this alone is not dispositive of our decision regarding the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  First, Wife prevailed on several issues at trial.Â  Secondly, Husbandâ€™s failure to comply with the terms of the Agreement necessitated Wife filing the action for contempt.Â  For example, Husband concedes he delayed in transferring the partiesâ€™ mountain property and beach property to Wife.Â  Finally, the court properly considered the requisite factors and exercised its discretion in limiting Wifeâ€™s award to $2,700 despite her request for $3,700.Â  Accordingly, we decline to vacate Wifeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the family court holding Husband in contempt and awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We reverse the courtâ€™s order requiring Husband to submit to a medical examination so that Wife could procure an insurance policy on his life.Â  Additionally, we reverse the courtâ€™s decision ordering Husband to provide additional information to Wife concerning a life insurance policy for the benefit of the partiesâ€™ emancipated son.Â  Finally, we modify the courtâ€™s order with respect to the amount of the award of post-judgment interest to Wife.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND MODIFIED IN PART.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  We note the family court ruled on several other issues regarding the Agreement.Â  However, we need not list or address them given these rulings are not pertinent to the instant appeal.\r\n[3]Â  $175,000 x 12% x 3/12 = $5,250.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (Supp. 2004) (â€œAll money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or entered shall draw interest according to law.Â  The legal interest is at the rate of twelve percent a year.â€).Â  We note the General Assembly amended this subsection on March 21, 2005.Â  This amendment, however, applies to all judgments entered on or after July 1, 2005.Â  Act No. 27, 2005 S.C. Acts 119.\r\n[4]Â  We note Wife contends that she has an insurable interest in Husbandâ€™s life because she is potentially liable for any debt associated with Husbandâ€™s medical practice.Â  We disagree with this contention given Wife, in the Agreement, specifically waived any interest in Husbandâ€™s practice and Husband agreed to indemnify Wife for any payments associated with the practice.Â  Moreover, Wifeâ€™s claim of potential liability is vague at best.Â  She offers no specific debt or liability she has as a result of Husbandâ€™s medical practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4032","title":"A &amp; I, Inc. v.

MacDonald, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Bobby Gore appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision to affirm the magistrate court verdict in favor of A&amp;I.Â  He argues a new trial should have been granted because the magistrateâ€™s return violated statutory mandates, the return was prepared ex parte, and the tapes of the original proceeding were lost.Â  He also argues the circuit court erred in failing to grant a continuance.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGore owned three apartments at the Sun Deck Horizontal Property Regime.Â  The master deed provided that apartment owners were responsible for any problems with interior walls and for maintenance and repairs on appliances and equipment â€œincluding any fixtures and/or their connections required to provide water, light, power, telephone, sewage, and sanitary service to his apartment.â€Â  The deed further provided that the Sun Deck Horizontal Property Regime Homeowners Association (â€œHOAâ€) was responsible for maintaining and repairing the common elements of the regime, including all plumbing located in the common elements.Â  â€œCommon elementsâ€ was defined to include load-bearing walls and pipes.Â  \r\nGore began experiencing water infiltration problems in his downstairs apartment, Apartment C.Â  He contacted A&amp;I to locate and repair the leak, and A&amp;I subcontracted Four Star Plumbing to perform the work.Â  After Four Star Plumbing employee Steve Beatty cut holes in the wall and ceiling of Apartment C, the source of the water damage to Apartment C was eventually determined to be a leaky washing machine valve in Goreâ€™s upstairs apartment, Apartment H.Â  The valve was replaced, and the leaking stopped.Â  Four Star Plumbing also suggested that the washing machine valve in Edward Edelenâ€™s adjacent apartment be replaced.Â  Edelen agreed and paid for the repairs.Â  After replacing the valve in Apartment H but prior to patching and repairing the walls and ceiling in Goreâ€™s apartments, A&amp;I requested payment from Gore.Â  Gore refused, believing the damages were to internal water pipes that were part of the common area of the regime.Â  Thus, he believed the repairs were the responsibility of the HOA.Â  Gore refused A&amp;I further access to his apartments to complete the repairs to the ceiling and walls.Â  \r\nA&amp;I eventually brought an action in magistrate court against Gore, Edelen as president of the HOA, and the HOA for the money owed on the repairs.Â  The day of the trial, Gore orally requested a continuance and a jury trial, and the magistrate denied both requests.Â  Several parties testified before the magistrate, including Lenny Green, an estimator for A&amp;I; Rod Tressle, an employee of A&amp;I; Edelen; and Steve Beatty, employee of Four Star Plumbing.Â  Green, Tressle, and Edelen testified that prior to agreeing to perform the work, they were all present at a meeting held by A&amp;I with Gore to establish the terms.Â  According to Green, Tressle, and Edelen, Gore agreed to pay for the work necessary to investigate and repair the leak.Â  Gore attempted to cross-examine Edelen regarding other litigation in which Edelen was involved, but the magistrate refused to allow the questioning.[1]Â  Gore also testified, denying the meeting or the agreement ever took place.Â  \r\nAfter hearing testimony from the parties, the magistrate determined that Gore made a direct agreement with A&amp;I to pay for the repair costs.Â  Thus, the magistrate found that it was irrelevant if the master deed provided that the particular repairs were something for which the HOA must pay.Â  The magistrate found for A&amp;I and ordered Gore to pay $2,257.74, plus interest and court costs.Â  \r\nGore filed his notice of appeal to the circuit court, arguing that the magistrate court erred in failing to:Â  (1) grant him a jury trial and a continuance; (2) allow him to cross-examine Edelen regarding past litigation; and (3) hold the HOA responsible for the charges due on the repairs.Â  The magistrate court contacted counsel for A&amp;I and informed him that the tapes of the magistrate court trial could not be transcribed.Â  The magistrate court requested that A&amp;Iâ€™s counsel draft a proposed return.Â  Counsel for A&amp;I drafted a proposed return and submitted it to the magistrate court.Â  The magistrate signed the return and submitted it to the circuit court.Â  Goreâ€™s counsel was not contacted by the magistrate court regarding the problems with the tapes, was not asked to submit a proposed return, and was not served with a copy of the return.Â  \r\nA hearing was held before the circuit court on July 21, 2004.Â  Goreâ€™s counsel objected that a return had not been filed in the case.Â  Counsel for A&amp;I informed the court that the magistrate court contacted him to prepare a submittal for the return because the tapes of the trial were of such poor quality they could not be transcribed and the magistrate â€œwas going to have to create a return from his notes.â€Â  Goreâ€™s counsel was then provided a copy of the return and given an opportunity to review it prior to arguing the appeal.Â  Goreâ€™s counsel argued the return was insufficient because it did not note that the magistrate prohibited Gore from cross-examining Edelen regarding other lawsuits in which he was involved.Â  Gore argued he never made an agreement to pay for the repairs.Â  He also argued the master deed to Sun Deck Condominiums provided that Gore would not be responsible for damage to common areas, Gore should not have been liable to pay A&amp;I even if he had made an agreement otherwise, and the HOA was responsible for the payments.Â  \r\nThe circuit court found no abuse of discretion for the magistrate to deny cross-examination of Edelen regarding other lawsuits.Â  The court ruled from the bench that there was adequate testimony to support the magistrateâ€™s findings regarding Goreâ€™s agreement to be responsible for the repair charges.Â  Finally, the court held that the magistrate did not abuse his discretion in denying Goreâ€™s motions for a jury trial and a continuance.Â  The appeal was dismissed, and a form order was signed that day.Â  \r\nOn August 24, 2004, Gore filed a notice of appeal from the July 21, 2004 form order.Â  A formal written order outlining the circuit courtâ€™s decision to affirm was filed August 19, 2004.Â  The notice of appeal does not refer to the formal August 19, 2004 order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the magistrate court, the circuit court may make its own findings of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985) (â€œIn giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors of law or fact.â€).Â  Where the circuit court has affirmed the magistrate court decision, this court looks to whether the circuit court order is â€œcontrolled by an error of law or is unsupported by the facts.â€Â  Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 490, 548 S.E.2d 605, 608 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThe Court of Appeals will presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a magistrateâ€™s judgment was made upon the merits where the testimony is sufficient to sustain the magistrateâ€™s judgment and there are no facts that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law.â€Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Magistrateâ€™s Return\r\nGore argues the circuit court erred in failing to reverse the magistrate and order a new trial because:Â  (1) the return did not comply with section 18-7-60 of the Code of Laws; (2) it was error for the magistrate to direct A&amp;Iâ€™s counsel to prepare the return ex parte; and (3) the judgment should have been vacated when the tapes were insufficient.Â  We disagree. \r\nA.

Â§ 18-7-60 (1985)\r\nGore asserts the magistrateâ€™s return failed to comply with section 18-7-60 because the section requires the magistrate, not a party, to prepare and file the return.Â  He argues that public policy requires the magistrate, as an unbiased judicial official, must prepare the return.Â  Because A&amp;I prepared the return, he argues the circuit court should have ordered a new trial.Â  \r\nIn order to evaluate the effect of this section, we must apply statutory construction rules.Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  \r\nWhen a party appeals to the circuit court from a magistrate court order, the magistrate court â€œshall thereupon, after ten days and within thirty days after service of the notice of appeal, make a return to the appellate court of the testimony, proceedings and judgment and file it in the appellate court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-60 (1985).Â  If the return is deemed defective, â€œthe appellate court may direct a further or amended return as often as may be necessary and may compel a compliance with its order.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-80 (1985); see Chapman v. Computers, Parts, &amp; Repairs, Inc., 334 S.C. 387, 390, 513 S.E.2d 120, 122 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding that where the magistrateâ€™s return is inadequate, the appropriate remedy is for the circuit court to direct the magistrate to file an amended return instead of remanding for a new trial).Â  \r\nSection 18-7-60 requires the magistrate to â€œmake a return to the appellate courtâ€ within a certain time period, but it does not indicate it would be error for the magistrate to seek assistance in drafting the return.Â  Because a plain reading of this section does not forbid the magistrate from seeking assistance where, as here, there were problems with the recording of the trial, we find such consultations do not violate the statute.Â  In this case, there is no question that the magistrate filed a return, and thus, the magistrate complied with the statute.Â  \r\nFurther, Goreâ€™s only complaint below regarding the sufficiency of the return was the failure to include the magistrateâ€™s refusal to allow him to cross-examine Edelen about other litigation.Â  Gore sought to use cross-examination to show that Edelen was not credible.Â  The circuit court found the return was adequate for reviewing Goreâ€™s grounds on appeal.Â  The court further found that because cross-examination is a matter within a courtâ€™s discretion, the magistrate did not err in refusing to allow Gore to cross-examine Edelen about something not normally allowed for impeachment purposes.Â  We agree with this finding.Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, the circuit court found in the formal order that Edelenâ€™s testimony was cumulative to other witnesses regarding Goreâ€™s promise to pay for the charges associated with the repairs.Â  Challenging the credibility of Edelen would not change the testimony of the other witnesses regarding Goreâ€™s promise.Â  See Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Center Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (finding that to warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and that there was a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the evidence or lack thereof).Â  Thus, we agree with the circuit court that Gore can point to no prejudice suffered by the failure to cross-examine Edelen.Â  \r\nFinally, we find that if the circuit court had found the return was deficient, the appropriate remedy would have been for the court to request an amended return from the magistrate, not order a new trial.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-80 (1985); Chapman, 334 S.C. at 390, 513 S.E.2d at 122.Â  Here, the court found the return was sufficient to allow it to address Goreâ€™s issues on appeal.Â  Gore does not appeal this finding.Â  Accordingly, the finding that the return was sufficient is the law of the case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P., 327 S.C. at 241, 489 S.E.2d at 472.Â  \r\nBecause the magistrate complied with the mandates of section 18-7-60 by filing a return and there was no basis to support ordering a new trial, we find no error with the circuit courtâ€™s decision to affirm the magistrate court and to deny a new trial.Â  \r\nB.Â  Ex Parte communications\r\nGore argues the magistrate erred in allowing A&amp;Iâ€™s counsel to prepare the return ex parte, and the prejudice he suffered from such a communication mandated a new trial.Â  \r\nEx parte communications are strongly disfavored.Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 623, 576 S.E.2d 156, 162 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, â€œprejudice must be shown to obtain a reversal on this ground.â€Â  Id.; see Burgess v. Stern, 311 S.C. 326, 331, 428 S.E.2d 880, 884 (1993) (finding no prejudice from a judgeâ€™s ex parte communication with one party for assistance in drafting a final order where the judgeâ€™s order was supported by the evidence).Â  â€œWhile this Court explicitly condemns ex parte communications, we do not adopt, per se, the view that all orders consequently emanating therefrom in part or in whole are rendered invalid.â€Â  Burgess, 311 S.C. at 331, 428 S.E.2d at 884.Â  \r\nInitially, we note that this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Although Gore questioned the validity pursuant to statute of allowing A&amp;I to draft the return, Gore never argued before the circuit court that he was entitled to a new trial due to the ex parte communication.Â  Issues not raised to or ruled upon by the lower court are not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  \r\nIn any event, we find Gore did not suffer any prejudice from the ex parte communications.Â  The return was drafted well after the magistrate issued his written order.Â  The return contained much of the same language as found in the order, with the addition of the summaries of testimony.Â  Further, although the return failed to indicate that the magistrate refused to allow cross-examination of Edelen regarding other litigation, Edelenâ€™s testimony was merely cumulative to that of other witnesses.Â  Thus, discrediting Edelen would not have affected the outcome of the trial.Â  Gore did not dispute the accuracy of the rest of the return, and he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the ex parte communication.Â  \r\nAlthough the unfortunate ex parte communication between the magistrate and A&amp;Iâ€™s counsel is strongly disfavored, we find no prejudice suffered by Gore.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by not granting a new trial and by affirming the magistrate court. \r\nC.Â  Lost tapes\r\nCiting McKinley Music v. Glymph, 100 S.C. 200, 84 S.E. 715 (1915), Gore argues the circuit court erred in failing to grant him a new trial because the tapes of the magistrate court proceeding were lost.Â  He argues that because the magistrate does not have records to make an amended return, the circuit court should have granted a new trial.Â  \r\nIn McKinley Music, the magistrate court found in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed the verdict to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed, ordering a new trial because the defendantâ€™s testimony â€œwas not fully taken down.â€Â  McKinley, 100 S.C. at 202, 84 S.E. at 716.Â  The supreme court affirmed, finding that an â€œamended or further return by the magistrate would not have been effective to supply testimony which had not been â€˜taken down.â€™â€Â  Id.\r\nWe find McKinley does not apply in the present case.Â  The circuit court held the return was sufficient to address the issues Gore raised on appeal.Â  Gore does not appeal that finding, and, as previously discussed, it is the law of the case.Â  The return did not leave out any testimony.Â  The only information omitted from the return was the magistrateâ€™s decision on questioning.Â  Further, there is no evidence in the record that the magistrate lost the tapes of the proceeding or his notes.Â  The arguments before the circuit court were that the magistrate had his notes and poor quality tapes, but he wanted submissions from counsel to aid him in preparing the return.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in refusing to grant a new trial pursuant to McKinley.Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Continuance\r\nGore argues the circuit court erred by requiring him to review the return and argue the case at the hearing despite the fact that the return was never properly served on him.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis issue is not properly before us.Â  Gore did not request a continuance when he was given a copy of the magistrateâ€™s return for the first time at the appellate hearing before the circuit court.Â  Because the lower court was not given the opportunity to consider whether Gore was entitled to a continuance, this issue is not preserved.Â  Staubes, 339 S.C. at 412, 529 S.E.2d at 546 (holding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the lower court are not preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nIn any event, Goreâ€™s argument also fails on the merits.Â  The decision to grant or deny a continuance is a matter within the lower courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Graybar Elec. Co. v. Rice, 287 S.C. 518, 520, 339 S.E.2d 883, 884 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Absent an abuse of discretion, the courtâ€™s decision to deny a continuance will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Hamm v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 312 S.C. 238, 241, 439 S.E.2d 852, 853 (1994).Â  \r\nNothing in the record indicates that Gore was prejudiced by going forward with his appellate argument before the circuit court.Â  He was given time to review the magistrateâ€™s return, and he informed the court that he excepted to the absence of the magistrateâ€™s ruling on cross-examination.Â  Despite the returnâ€™s failure to include a reference to the magistrateâ€™s ruling, the circuit court was able to rule upon Goreâ€™s complaint on appeal concerning this issue.Â  The court found that because the decision to allow certain questioning was discretionary, there was no error for the magistrate to prohibit Goreâ€™s questioning about unrelated litigation.Â  Reviewing these facts, we find no abuse of discretion in the failure to grant a continuance.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the magistrateâ€™s return complies with section 18-7-60, Gore was not prejudiced by ex parte contact between the magistrate and A&amp;Iâ€™s counsel, and the circuit court did not err in failing to grant a new trial pursuant to McKinley due to problems with the magistrateâ€™s tapes.Â  Further, we find no error with the circuit courtâ€™s failure to grant a continuance. \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the magistrate courtâ€™s verdict is\r\n AFFIRMED.[2]\r\n GOOLSBY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This fact is not found in the magistrateâ€™s return and is an issue on appeal.Â  Gore argued before the circuit court that the return failed to note the attempt to cross-examine Edelen.Â  Counsel for A&amp;I did not dispute the fact that the attempt to cross-examine Edelen occurred or the failure of the return to include that fact.Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4033","title":"State v.

Jefferson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4033\r\nHeard September 13, 2005 â€“ Filed October 17, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Cornelius Washington appeals his conviction for murder, raising two evidentiary issues.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWashington was involved in a ten-year relationship with Andreia Cropper, ending in April or May of 2002.Â  After the breakup, Cropper met Roy Cotman, a security guard.Â  On August 28, 2002, Cropper and Cotman spent the day together, looking at apartments and fishing.Â  When Cotman drove Cropper home that evening, Washington was waiting in the parking area.Â  Soon after Cotman and Cropperâ€™s arrival, Washington stabbed Cotman.Â  Cropper and Washington testified to different versions of the events surrounding the stabbing.Â  \r\nCropperâ€™s Version of the Facts\r\nAs Cropper exited Cotmanâ€™s vehicle, Washington hit Cropperâ€™s head with his fist.Â  Cropper noticed knives in Washingtonâ€™s hands.Â  Cropper ran to the door of her motherâ€™s home, knocked, and kicked the door.Â  Washington stated, â€œThereâ€™s no need knocking on the door because your mama, she ainâ€™t there.Â  Sheâ€™s over at your auntâ€™s house.â€Â  Washington then began yelling at Cotman.Â  Cropper told Washington to leave Cotman alone â€œbecause he had nothing to do with it.â€Â  Washington leaned into the driverâ€™s side of Cotmanâ€™s vehicle.Â  Cropper grabbed the back of Washingtonâ€™s shirt and pulled him out of the car.Â  Cropper next saw Cotman lying on the ground behind the car with blood on his shoulders.Â  \r\nWashingtonâ€™s Version of the Facts\r\nWhen Cropper exited Cotmanâ€™s vehicle, Washington stated, â€œOh, still messing around with him, huh?â€Â  Cotman backed out of the parking area, but returned because Cropper and Washington began arguing.Â  Cotman opened the door of his car and said, â€œLeave her alone.â€Â  Cotman exited his vehicle, turned on the interior light of the vehicle, and bent over to look under the seats.Â  Washington said, â€œI hope youâ€™re not going to get a weapon to hurt me.â€Â  Cotman did not reply.Â  Washington repeated, â€œI hope you not be looking for no weapon to hurt me with.â€Â  Cotman opened the back door of his vehicle and started searching under the back seats.Â  Washington said, â€œMan, I not gonna let you get nothing out of that car to hurt me with.â€Â  After warning Cotman a few more times, Washington unbuckled his knife and walked toward the car.Â  Cotman jumped up and turned around.Â  Washington began â€œswingingâ€ his arms at Cotman because he thought Cotman might have a gun.Â  After Cropper pulled Washington away from Cotman, Cotman walked toward the trunk and fell to the ground.Â  Washington testified he did not realize Cotman was injured until Cotman â€œfell on his face.â€Â  Before leaving the scene, Washington placed Cotman into the vehicle.Â  \r\nOther Facts\r\nWhen police officers arrived at the scene, they found Cotman bleeding profusely and lying face down in the back seat of his car. Â An EMS paramedic testified Cotman was not breathing and had no pulse. Â EMS transported Cotman to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.\r\nA forensic pathologist testified Cotman suffered a stab wound above the collarbone, a stab wound on his chin, and two cuts on his right forearm. Â \r\nCorporal Scott Kiblock of the Charleston Police Department was present at the crime scene. Â Kiblock drove Cropper to the Charleston Police Department headquarters to obtain her written statement.Â  The interview process began approximately ninety minutes after the stabbing.Â  During the interview, Cropper was noticeably upset and crying. Â \r\nOfficer Jeffrey Miller, a crime scene technician, investigated the scene and found blood on the front passenger seat, on the rear passenger seat, down the passenger side of the vehicle, and on the trunk. Â Officer Miller found no blood on the driverâ€™s seat or the interior panel of the driverâ€™s side. Â In addition, Officer Miller found a gun and a knife in the trunk of the vehicle. Â The gun was issued to Cotman in connection with his employment as a security guard.Â  \r\nPolice officers found Washington shortly after the murder and arrested him.Â  The officers found two knives on Washington. Â One knife had Cotmanâ€™s blood on the blade.Â  \r\nThe case proceeded to trial on August 25, 2003.Â  Cropper, Washington, Officer Miller, Corporal Kiblock, and several other witnesses testified.&nbsp;\r\nThe jury convicted Washington of murder.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 79, 606 S.E.2d 215, 218-19 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Exclusion of Gun and Knife\r\nWashington argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence of the gun and knife found in the trunk of Cotmanâ€™s vehicle, alleging it was relevant to his claim of self-defense. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nRelevant evidence is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œTo establish self-defense, the defendant must establish:Â  (1) he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) he actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief; and (4) he had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.â€Â  State v. Long, 325 S.C. 59, 62, 480 S.E.2d 62, 63&nbsp;(1997).Â  \r\nCropper proffered testimony about the gun and knife.Â  Cropper testified Cotman carried a firearm in his vehicle because he was a security guard. Â She further testified Cotmanâ€™s gun was in the trunk of his car on the day of the murder because â€œhe knew that I didnâ€™t like guns.â€Â  When asked whether Cotman was armed with the gun at any point, Cropper responded:Â  â€œNo, it was in the trunk of his car.â€Â  She added she never saw the trunk open. Â Cropper had no knowledge concerning the knife found in the trunk. Â Officer Miller also proffered testimony, stating he found the gun and knife in the trunk of Cotmanâ€™s vehicle.Â  \r\nWashington testified Cotman exited his vehicle and searched underneath the front and back seats.Â  Washington stated:Â  â€œmost people, like my grandfather and them, they carry they gun under the car seat, you know.Â  So I donâ€™t see no other reason . . . for him to be . . . [looking] under the seat.â€ Â \r\nThe trial court refused to admit testimony regarding the weapons found in the trunk of the vehicle on the ground of relevancy.Â  The trial court found:Â  â€œThe Defense . . . has not been precluded from presenting a defense of self-defense or from presenting evidence of self-defense.Â  The Court has merely made a ruling regarding the admissibility of the gun and knife that were found in a locked trunk.â€Â  The trial court concluded the weapons were not â€œrelevant or probative to any issue in this case.â€Â  \r\nWashington contends evidence of the gun and the knife in the trunk was relevant to show he reasonably believed he was in imminent danger.Â  There is no evidence in the record, however, indicating Washington knew Cotman had weapons in his trunk on the day of the stabbing, nor is there evidence Washington was aware Cotman ever carried a weapon in his trunk.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence that Cotman searched his trunk prior to the stabbing.Â  In fact, there was blood on the trunk, indicating that when Cotman approached the trunk, he had already been stabbed.Â  \r\nFinally, Washington presented his claim of self-defense.Â  He testified to his own experience and his grandfatherâ€™s custom of keeping weapons in vehicles.Â  He explained his belief, at the time of the incident, that Cotman might have a weapon in the car.Â  The trial court charged the jury on the law of self-defense.Â  Under these facts, we find no prejudicial error by the trial court in excluding evidence regarding weapons found in Cotmanâ€™s trunk.Â  \r\nII.Â  Hearsay, the Excited Utterance Exception, and Testimonial Evidence\r\nWashington also argues the trial court erred in allowing Corporal Kiblock to testify regarding the contents of Cropperâ€™s written statement.Â  The trial court found the statement qualified as an excited utterance.Â  Washington argues the trial court erred in admitting the testimony because it was hearsay, was not an excited utterance, and it improperly bolstered Cropperâ€™s testimony.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Hearsay is inadmissible as evidence unless an exception applies.Â  State v. Townsend, 321 S.C. 55, 59, 467 S.E.2d 138, 141 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  One exception is the excited utterance exception.Â  Rule 803, SCRE.Â  \r\nâ€œThree elements must be met to show a statement is an excited utterance:Â (1) the statement must relate to a startling event or\r\ncondition; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of the excitement; and (3) the stress must have been caused by the startling event or condition.Â  The court must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a statement falls within the excited utterance\r\nexception.â€Â  State v. Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 402-03, 613 S.E.2d 760, 780-81 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal citations omitted).Â  The rationale for the excited utterance exception lies in the\r\nspecial reliability accorded to a statement uttered in spontaneous excitement that suspends the declarantâ€™s powers of reflection and fabrication.Â  Id. at 403, 613 S.E.2d at 781.Â  The passage of time between the startling event and the hearsay statement is not necessarily a dispositive factor.Â  State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 328, 247 S.E.2d 334, 336 (decided prior to the adoption of the Rules of Evidence and discussing the â€œexcited utteranceâ€ exception as res gestae; noting that a time interval of over one hour, and up to eleven hours, did not necessarily eliminate a statement as part of the res gestae).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the stabbing was clearly a startling event.Â  There is evidence Cropper was under stress caused by the stabbing at the time she made her statement.Â  Corporal Kiblock testified in camera that the statement began approximately ninety minutes after the incident.Â  According to Kiblock, Cropper was â€œextremely upset and distraughtâ€ as she gave her statement.Â  She cried throughout the statement, stopping at times to regain her composure.Â  Finally, the stress was caused by the startling event of her ex-boyfriend stabbing her new boyfriend.Â  \r\nIn addition, although Washington argues that a â€œnarrativeâ€ statement given to police is inadmissible under this exception, numerous South Carolina cases have held otherwise.Â  See State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 43, 515 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1999) (providing an extensive list of instances in which the court has admitted statements to police pursuant to the former common law res gestae exception).Â  \r\nWashington relies in part on Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), an important case decided by the United States Supreme Court subsequent to Washingtonâ€™s trial.Â  However, we find Crawford does not apply.Â  In Crawford, the prosecution introduced tape-recorded statements made to police by Crawfordâ€™s wife, Sylvia.Â  Id. at 38-40.Â  Resorting to the application of the marital privilege, which generally bars a spouse from testifying without the other spouseâ€™s consent, Sylvia did not testify at trial, and was therefore considered an unavailable witness.Â  Id. at 40.Â  On appeal, the court concluded that when the declarant is unavailable, hearsay statements that are testimonial in nature can be admitted into evidence only when the declarant has previously been subjected to cross-examination.Â  Id. at 68.Â  The courtâ€™s analysis was rooted in a defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment[1] right to confrontation.Â  In the instant case, had Cropper been unavailable as a witness at trial, Crawford would be controlling and the admission of her statement likely error.[2]Â  However, because Cropper was available and did in fact testify at trial, a confrontation clause analysis under Crawford is not required. \r\nWe agree with Washington that Cropperâ€™s statement constituted hearsay.Â  However, we find, like the trial court, that the statement qualified for admission under the excited utterance exception.Â  Finally, we find the statement did not improperly bolster Cropperâ€™s testimony, as her statement contained numerous differences compared to her direct testimony.Â  See Ingle&nbsp;v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 474, 560 S.E.2d 401, 404 (2002); Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 21, 443 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1994).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â â€œIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him. . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.\r\n[2]  Â Â Although the Supreme Court failed to define what constitutes a testimonial statement, it concluded, â€œ[s]tatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are . . . testimonial under even a narrow standard.â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4034","title":"Brown v.

Hemphill, of Greenwood, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ANDERSON, J.:Â  The workersâ€™ compensation commission affirmed the order of the single commissioner awarding benefits to Edwin H. Brown (Brown) for an occupational lung disease, byssinosis, which Brown claims he developed from working with cotton for many years at Greenwood Mills, Inc. (Greenwood).Â  The circuit court affirmed the commissionâ€™s ruling that Brownâ€™s claim was within the statute of limitations, but declared the commission should have allocated a portion of Brownâ€™s disease to his long history of cigarette smoking, a non-compensable cause.Â  Therefore, the circuit court remanded the case to the commission for allocation.Â  Both parties appealed. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGreenwood employed Brown from 1966 to 1982 and again from 1983 until 1998.Â  As a Greenwood employee, Brown worked primarily with cotton in the carding, spinning, and preparation departments.Â  While at work, he frequently was exposed to cotton dust.Â  Brown, who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for approximately forty-five years, stopped working in 1998 due to breathing problems.\r\nBrownâ€™s respiratory difficulties started sometime around the early 1990s.Â  At that time, Greenwood began performing two breathing tests a year on Brown in order to evaluate and monitor his breathing troubles.Â  Although he quit smoking in February of 1995, Brown continued to suffer from shortness of breath, difficulty walking, and fatigue.Â  In December 1997, Greenwood referred Brown to Dr. Cobb for treatment.Â  \r\nDr. Cobb diagnosed Brown as having hyper-expanded lungs, a depressed diaphragm, and obstructive lung disease.Â  Initially, Dr. Cobb opined that Brownâ€™s obstructive lung disease was â€œprobably secondary to remote tobacco use with progressive airway obstruction.â€Â  The doctor asseverated, â€œI do not think this is a specific reaction to his work environment.â€Â  However, after additional testing showed Brown experienced drops â€œin his flow rates across the work shift,â€ Dr. Cobb recommended that Greenwood remove Brown from work for three months to see if his absence from the job would ameliorate his condition.Â  Brownâ€™s leave did improve his breathing.Â  As Dr. Cobb wrote in his report of June 18, 1998:\r\n\r\nMr. Brown feels better.Â  His exertional tolerance is slightly improved and he experiences less cough at the present time.\r\n. . . . \r\nThe majority of his disease is emphysema related to his previous tobacco use. . . . In addition to the emphysema from smoking, however, he does have a component of industrial related broncospasm.Â  I think this is more likely a nonspecific bronchitis than true byssinosis, but in any event, his underlying disease is exacerbated and has shown documented improvement on a period away from work and my recommendation is that he be removed from the present work space.\r\n\r\nBrown did not work for Greenwood after 1998.Â  \r\nOn December 4, 2001, Brown was treated at a Veteransâ€™ Administration Clinic in Augusta, Georgia.Â  There, for the first time, he was diagnosed with byssinosis.Â  The report from the VA Clinic records:\r\n\r\nAssessment:\r\nHypertension. Not controlled\r\n. . . .\r\nHx occupational exposure to cotton dust.44years. including carding and preparation.\r\nBysinnosis. hx chest tightness and pre and post shift changes in spirometry (reactivity)\r\nHx industrial noise exposure\r\n\r\nBrown filed a Form 50 on February 14, 2002.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Greenwood presented the medical report of Dr. R. L. Galphin.Â  Dr. Galphin believed Brownâ€™s disease â€œwas most probably due to his long history of cigarette smoking, which may have been aggravated by exposure to respirable cotton trash dust and reactivity to that dust particularly in the latter part of his employment.â€Â  He estimated that â€œ70% of Mr. Brownâ€™s impairment is related to his long history of cigarette abuse and 30% may represent a worsening of the condition secondary to his exposure to dust in the cotton textile industry.â€Â  However, Dr. Galphin never examined Brown.Â  His opinion was based solely on a review of records from Greenwood and Dr. Cobb.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner issued an order, which stated:\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing all of the evidence in the case, it is the finding of the undersigned that the claimantâ€™s respiratory disease arose out of and in the course of his employment; said disease was due to hazards of the employment which are excess of hazards normally incident to normal employees.Â  The disease is peculiar to the textile mill wherein they were running cotton products.Â  There have been numerous cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (byssinosis) arising out of inhalation of the organic or inorganic dust in the textile industry.Â  See, Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 SC [3]78, 335 SE2d 91 (1985)[.]Â  The hazards causing this condition are peculiar to the textile industry in which the claimant was employed for many years.Â  Based on the opinions of the doctors at the VA Clinic, it is found that the claimantâ€™s respiratory disease was a result of the exposure to cotton dust and trash in his employment.Â  The conditions of his exposure are peculiar to his employment.Â  Most particularly, his pre and post work pulmonary function studies, done by the employer, show he was having a reaction to the environment.Â  Further, the doctors at the VA Clinic opined he had severe COPD as a result of many years of textile work.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner found that the statute of limitations had not run prior to the filing of Brownâ€™s claim because he was not definitively diagnosed with byssinosis until December 4, 2001.Â  Indeed, Dr. Cobb, in 1998, had suggested, â€œthis is more likely a nonspecific bronchitis than true byssinosis,â€ and that â€œ[h]is primary disease is emphysema related to underlying previous tobacco use.â€Â  \r\nThe appellate panel affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s ruling with the following language:\r\n\r\nIn an Appellate Review, the Commission has the power to weigh the evidence as presented at the initial hearing, and, after careful review in the instant case, the Commission, by unanimous vote, has determined that all of the Hearing Commissionerâ€™s Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law are correct as stated.Â  Accordingly, they shall become, and hereby are, the law of the case; and, therefore, the Order is sustained in its entirety.Â  \r\n\r\nGreenwood appealed to the circuit court arguing (1) the statute of limitations had run on Brownâ€™s claim, and (2) the panel erred in failing to determine the proportion of Brownâ€™s disability allocable to non-compensable causesâ€”i.e., smokingâ€”pursuant to sections 42-11-90 and â€“100 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The circuit court affirmed the panel as to the finding that the claim was within the statute of limitations, but reversed on the award of benefits:\r\n\r\nIn this case, the record is replete with evidence of the Claimantâ€™s forty-five (45) year history of smoking, a non-compensable cause, and its effect on his lungs.Â  Even if the Commission dismissed Dr. Galphinsâ€™s opinion as not being credible, Dr. Cobbâ€™s June 19, 1998 opinion that the majority of Claimantâ€™s lung disease was non-compensable cannot be ignored.Â  Indeed, the employer does have the burden of proving not only the interplay of a non-compensable cause, but also its proportion to the overall disability.Â  Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 SC 378, 335 SE2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  In this case, the employer clearly met that burden, and no substantial evidence exists in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s findings to the contrary.Â  As such, in light of the statutesâ€™ mandatory language, the employer was entitled to a determination of the proportion allocable to the non-compensable cause, smoking, and a corresponding reduction of compensation owed to the Claimant.Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court remanded the case to the commission â€œwith the specific direction to make the necessary findings as to the apportionment between compensable versus non-compensable causes, and a corresponding reduction in the Claimantâ€™s disability award.â€Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Appealability\r\nGreenwood asserts, as a threshold matter, that the circuit courtâ€™s order remanding the case to the commission is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe rule governing the appealability of a circuit court order remanding a case to the commission is set forth in Montjoy v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618 (1994):\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-390 (1986) provides:\r\n  \r\nAn aggrieved party may obtain a review of any final judgment of the circuit court under this article by appeal to the Supreme Court.Â  The appeal shall be taken as in other civil cases.\r\n  \r\nAccordingly, we have consistently held that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.Â  Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984); Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983).\r\n\r\nMontjoy, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618.Â  \r\nThe question here is whether the circuit court order is a â€œfinal judgmentâ€ under section 1-23-390.Â  Generally, an order is a final judgment on one or more issues if it constitutes an ultimate decision on the merits.Â  In Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984), one of the two cases cited by the Montjoy court, the supreme court found â€œ[t]he order of the circuit court does not involve the merits of the action.Â  It is therefore interlocutory and not reviewable by this Court for lack of finality.â€Â  Owens, 281 S.C. at 492, 316 S.E.2d at 385 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).Â  Similarly, in Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983), the supreme court held that â€œ[b]ecause the interlocutory order of the circuit court does not involve the merits of the action, it is not reviewable by this Court for lack of finality.â€Â  Id. (emphasis added) (citations omitted).Â  Accordingly, in determining whether the courtâ€™s order constitutes a final judgment, we must inquire whether the order finally decides an issue on the merits.Â  \r\nâ€œAn order involves the merits if it finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense in the case.â€ Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 427 S.E.2d 685 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Henderson v. Wyatt, 8 S.C. 112 (1877)).Â  In the case sub judice, the order of the circuit court finally determined an issue on the meritsâ€”that Brownâ€™s smoking, a non-compensable cause, contributed to his disability.Â  The court noted â€œthe employer does have the burden of proving . . . the interplay of a non-compensable causeâ€ and found â€œthe employer clearly met that burden[.]â€Â  Consequently, the circuit court ruled that â€œthe employer was entitled to a determination of the proportion allocable to the non-compensable cause[.]â€Â  The case was remanded, not for evaluation whether apportionment was appropriate, but â€œwith specific direction to make the necessary findings as to the apportionment between compensable versus non-compensable causes, and a corresponding reduction in the Claimantâ€™s disability award.â€Â Â  \r\nThe courtâ€™s order mandates apportionment.Â  This ruling is a decision on the merits because it decides with finality whether Greenwood is required to reduce its compensation under sections 42-11-90 and â€“100.Â  Although the judge left the percentage of apportionment to the commission on remand, the panel would have no choice but to allocate some part of Brownâ€™s disability to the non-compensable cause.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order constitutes a final decision on the issue of apportionment and is appealable.Â  \r\nII.Â  Statute of Limitations\r\nGreenwood maintains that Brown filed his claim outside the period of the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 42-15-40 provides:\r\nThe right to compensation under this title is barred unless a claim is filed with the commission within two years after an accident, or if death resulted from accident, within two years of the date of death.Â  However, for occupational disease claims the two-year period does not begin to run until the employee concerned has been diagnosed definitively as having an occupational disease and has been notified of the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn McCraw v. Mary Black Hospital, 350 S.C. 229, 565 S.E.2d 286 (2002), our supreme court proclaimed that section 42-15-40 â€œrequires that the employee be: (1) â€˜diagnosed definitively as having an occupational disease,â€™ and (2) â€˜notified of the diagnosis[.]â€™â€Â  350 S.C. at 235-36, 565 S.E.2d at 289.Â  In McCraw, Carolyn McCraw, a nurse, began experiencing breathing problems associated with handling potent chemicals in the endoscopy unit of the hospital where she was employed.Â  Dr. Applebaum, who worked with McCraw, noticed her breathing difficulties.Â  McCraw discussed her condition with Dr. Applebaum on an informal basis until September of 1991 when she transferred out of the endoscopy unit.Â  She then began seeing Dr. Applebaum, and on November 19, 1992, McCraw was admitted to the hospital for treatment of asthma and pneumonia.Â  She did not file a workersâ€™ compensation claim until November 14, 1994.Â  Although McCraw began to experience her work-induced breathing ailments more than two years before filing her claim, the supreme court found that the statute of limitations did not bar her from benefits:\r\n\r\nConsidering the record as a whole, it simply is not reasonable to conclude that Dr. Applebaumâ€™s informal conversations with McCraw in the endoscopy unit constituted a definitive diagnosis, or that McCrawâ€™s understanding her asthma was affected by the workplace chemicals somehow constitutes notification of definitive diagnosis of an occupational disease.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 236, 565 S.E.2d at 289.Â Â  \r\nHere, Brown was not definitively diagnosed as having byssinosis until his December 2001 visit to the VA Clinic.Â  Greenwood asserts that Brownâ€™s claim is barred because he understood in 1998 his deteriorated breathing condition was related to his work environment.Â  However, both the statute and precedent make clear that in an occupational disease context, the statute of limitations begins to run only upon notification of a definitive diagnosis.Â  As stated by the court in McCraw, â€œit simply is not reasonable to concludeâ€ a claimantâ€™s â€œunderstandingâ€ that his condition â€œwas affected by the workplaceâ€ environment â€œsomehow constitutes notification of definitive diagnosis of an occupational disease.â€Â  350 S.C. at 236, 565 S.E.2d at 289.Â  Brown was given a definitive diagnosis on December 4, 2001, and he filed his Form 50 on February 14, 2002.Â  Therefore, his claim is timely, and we affirm the circuit court as to the statute of limitations issue.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Allocation Under Sections 42-11-90 and â€“100 \r\n\r\nSection 42-11-90 states:\r\nWhen an occupational disease prolongs, accelerates or aggravates or is prolonged, accelerated or aggravated by any other cause or infirmity not otherwise compensable, the compensation payable for disability or death shall be limited to the disability which would have resulted solely from the occupational disease if there were no other such cause or infirmity and shall be computed by the proportion which the disability from occupational disease bears to the entire disability.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-90 (1985).Â  Similarly, code section 42-11-100 reads, in pertinent part,\r\n\r\nCompensation payable for disability from an occupational disease must be the same as that provided for an injury under this title.Â  No compensation is payable: \r\n  \r\n(1)Â  For the degree of disability resulting from noncompensable causes . . . . \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-100 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nThe case sub judice is similar to Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Charles Hanks was exposed to cotton dust for approximately fifteen years as an employee of Blair Mills.Â  In addition, he smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes a day â€œfor years.â€Â  Hanks was diagnosed with byssinosis and was awarded benefits.Â  The commission did not apportion the award under section 42-11-90, and this Court affirmed.Â  We observed:\r\n\r\nThe issue of the extent of disability is a question of fact to be proved as any other fact is proved.Â  Arnold v. Benjamin Booth Co., 257 S.C. 337, 185 S.E.2d 830 (1971).Â  This Courtâ€™s function is not to resolve conflicts in the evidence but to determine from the record if substantial evidence supports the agencyâ€™s finding. \r\n. . . .\r\nThe evidence revealed that Hanks had smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes a day for years and that smoking can cause or contribute to chronic obstructive lung disease.Â  Appellants, however, presented no evidence of the percentage of Hanksâ€™ disability that was caused by smoking.Â \r\nMizell v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 281 S.C. 430, 315 S.E.2d 123 (1984).Â  We thus find no merit in the appellantsâ€™ contention that the court should have apportioned the award based on Section 42-11-90.Â  \r\n\r\n286 S.C. at 384-85, 335 S.E.2d at 95.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the single commissioner was cognizant of section 42-11-90.Â  Greenwood raised the statute and the issue of allocation at the hearing, and the commissioner responded:\r\n\r\nAnd in the pretrial conference you had stated your position in regards to the apportionment and I advised that I would like just a short brief, five, ten pages, on the issue of apportionment.Â  And if you would submit that to me in ten or fifteen days.Â  And Ms. McKenzie [counsel for Brown] is certainly entitled to do a brief on her position as well.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the commissionerâ€™s order expressly finds, as a conclusion of law, \r\n\r\n6. Per Â§ 42-11-90, the claimant is entitled to compensation for his disability as being related to and as a result of an occupational disease resulting from cotton dust exposure. (See, Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 SC 378, 335 SE2d 91, 1985[.]\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  The commissionerâ€™s order concluded: \r\n\r\n[T]he claimantâ€™s respiratory disease arose out of and in the course of his employment; said disease was due to hazards of the employment which are excess of hazards normally incident to normal employees. . . . Based on the opinions of the doctors at the VA Clinic, it is found that the claimantâ€™s respiratory disease was a result of the exposure to cotton dust and trash in his employment.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe linchpin of this case is the standard by which we must review factual determinations of the commission. The South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the workersâ€™ compensation commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Bass v. Isochem, ___S.C.___, 617 S.E.2d 369 (Ct. App. 2005); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â \r\nBursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp;\r\nEnvtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Liberty\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in a workersâ€™ compensation decision.Â  Frame, 357 S.C. at 527, 593 S.E.2d at 494; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Lockridge v. Santens of America, Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€).Â  Pursuant to the APA, this Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the appellate panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  See Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 610 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); see also Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 191, 603 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œA reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the workersâ€™ compensation commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.â€); Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting that in reviewing decision of workersâ€™ compensation commission, court of appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported by substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004); Jones v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 586 S.E.2d 111 (2003); Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 562 S.E.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2002); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe appellate panel is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729; Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â \r\nShealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495; Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999); DuRant v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp;\r\nEnvtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 604 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin, 351 S.C. at 618, 571 S.E.2d at 95; Muir, 336 S.C. at 282, 519 S.E.2d at 591.Â  Where there are conflicts in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the appellate panel are conclusive.Â  Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 290, 599 S.E.2d at 611; Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 455, 562 S.E.2d at 681.\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of the appellate panel which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Pratt, 357 S.C. at 622, 594 S.E.2d at 274-75; Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.\r\nThe parties presented the commissioner with conflicting medical opinion evidence as to the cause of Brownâ€™s disability.Â  Whether a history of cigarette smoking was a causal factor in Brownâ€™s disease was a factual question which the commissioner and the commission answered in the negative.Â  The commissioner noted that byssinosis is a condition peculiarly associated with cotton dust exposure.Â  Additionally, Brown stopped smoking in 1995, yet his condition worsened between 1995 and 1998.Â  Tests demonstrated that his work environment negatively affected Brownâ€™s breathing.Â  Finally, the opinion of the doctor from the VA Clinic, the only doctor to definitively diagnose Brown with byssinosis, stated that Brownâ€™s condition was the result of forty-four years of exposure to cotton dust.\r\nAlthough the circuit court might have ruled differently had it been the fact finder, it was error for the court to substitute its factual judgment in place of the commissionâ€™s.Â  As we observed in Stone v. Traylor Brothers, Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 600 S.E.2d 551 (Ct.

Mekler\r\n  after receiving a report that a man had been shot.Â  When the first officer\r\n  arrived, he found a man lying face down on the ground and observed two women\r\n  standing near the porch of the home.Â  The women approached him and one of them,\r\n  Mekler, told the officer she â€œjust shot the person who was lying on the\r\n  ground.â€Â  The victim, Phillip Bubba Spires (hereinafter Bubba), was transported\r\n  to the hospital with gun shot wounds to the chest.Â  The medical personnel lost\r\n  Bubbaâ€™s pulse on the way to the hospital and Bubba was later pronounced dead at\r\n  the hospital.Â  An autopsy revealed Bubba died from a single gunshot that caused\r\n  numerous pellets to hit and enter his body, resulting in damage to vital\r\n  organs.Â  Deputy Richard Combs arrived on the scene and took a statement from\r\n  Mekler.[1]Â \r\n  Mekler told Deputy Combs that she had been sitting on her porch with Bubbaâ€™s\r\n  wife, Robette Spires, talking and drinking when Bubba pulled up in her yard in\r\n  his truck.Â  Bubba began screaming and yelling at Robette, asking why she was\r\n  not at home and stating that she should have called him.Â  Mekler told Bubba to\r\n  leave several times.Â  After a few minutes of â€œyelling back and forth,â€ Bubba\r\n  left in his truck.Â  A few minutes later, Bubba returned on foot.Â  This time,\r\n  Bubba had a knife in his hand.Â  Bubba came onto the porch and the screaming and\r\n  yelling started again.Â  Mekler went into her house and retrieved a\r\n  sixteen-gauge shotgun.Â  When she returned to the porch, Bubba still had a knife\r\n  in his hand.Â  Bubba continuously tried to get Robette to leave with him.Â \r\n  Mekler told Bubba several times to leave or she would shoot him.Â  Mekler was\r\n  afraid Bubba was going to hurt Robette if Robette left with him.Â  Mekler stated\r\n  she did not remember pulling the trigger, nor the shotgun going off, and the\r\n  next thing she knew, Bubba grabbed his chest and Robette said, â€œYou shot\r\n  him.â€Â Â  \r\nDeputy\r\n  Combs also took a statement from Robette that night.Â  Robette told him that she\r\n  and Mekler had been talking and drinking on the front porch when Bubba pulled\r\n  up in the yard in his truck.Â  Bubba started yelling and screaming at her, â€œWhy\r\n  arenâ€™t you home?Â  You should have called and told me where you were.â€Â  Mekler\r\n  told Bubba several times to leave.Â  Bubba left a few minutes later and, a few\r\n  minutes after that, returned on foot.Â  When Bubba came back, he had a knife in\r\n  his hand.Â  Mekler, at that time, went into the house and retrieved a\r\n  sixteen-gauge shotgun.Â  Mekler told Bubba several times to leave or she would\r\n  shoot him.Â  Robette asked Bubba why he had the knife, and he stated â€œitâ€™s not\r\n  for you, itâ€™s for the dog in case it tries to attack me.â€Â  Robette did not\r\n  think Mekler heard Bubba say that.Â  Robette stated she believed that Mekler\r\n  believed she was protecting Robette.Â  \r\nDetective\r\n  Rhonda Bamberg testified that as she transported Mekler to the Orangeburg\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Office, Mekler began to tell her about the incident.Â  Mekler\r\n  told the detective that she and Robette were drinking and talking when Bubba\r\n  came up in his truck.Â  Bubba â€œgot out and began to carry on about why Robette\r\n  was not home and why she didnâ€™t call.â€Â  Mekler told Bubba he needed to calm\r\n  down or leave.Â  Bubba got in his truck and left.Â  A little while later, Bubba\r\n  returned, brandishing a knife.Â  Mekler told Bubba he did not need a knife.Â \r\n  Mekler grabbed her dog that was chained to the front porch.Â  Bubba said the\r\n  knife was for the dog.Â  Mekler told Bubba that if he were to quiet down, the\r\n  dog would stop.Â  Mekler told Bubba to leave or she would shoot him.Â  Mekler\r\n  stated Bubba was a big man and she was afraid of him.Â  Bubba would not leave.Â \r\n  Mekler went into the house and came out again.Â  â€œShe brought the gun down and\r\n  donâ€™t (sic) remember the shot, but Robette said, Jackie, youâ€™ve shot him.â€Â \r\n  Mekler said, â€œNo, I didnâ€™t.â€Â  Robette said, â€œYes, you did.â€Â  Mekler told\r\n  Robette to go call 9-1-1.Â  Mekler again stated that she was afraid of Bubba and\r\n  that he would not leave.Â  \r\nOnce\r\n  at the Sheriffâ€™s Office, Mekler gave another statement, this time to Detective\r\n  Rush.Â  Mekler told the detective that she and Robette were sitting on her porch\r\n  drinking and talking.Â  One of Robetteâ€™s daughters pulled into the yard and told\r\n  Robette that Bubba had called and wanted Robette to call him when she got\r\n  home.Â  Thereafter, Bubba pulled up in his truck, got out and then began\r\n  â€œscreaming and crying at Robette.â€Â  Bubba said, â€œWhy are you doing this to me?Â \r\n  Didnâ€™t they tell you to call me?â€Â  Robette said, â€œYes,â€ and began walking\r\n  toward Bubba.Â  Then Bubba started yelling at Robette saying â€œWhy are you here?Â \r\n  Why havenâ€™t you called me?â€Â  Mekler described Bubba as â€œloud and showing\r\n  himself.â€Â  Mekler stated she was afraid Bubba was going to hit Robette, and\r\n  stated Bubba was â€œflailing aroundâ€ and possibly hit his truck.Â  Mekler walked\r\n  down to Bubba and asked him to come sit with them and talk.Â  Bubba kept yelling\r\n  at Robette, and the two women tried to calm him.Â  Bubba kept yelling and Mekler\r\n  told him that if he did not calm down, he would have to leave because he could\r\n  not act that way in her yard.Â  Bubba replied, â€œthis is my wife and Iâ€™ll act any\r\n  way I want.â€Â  Robette told Bubba he could not â€œshow out like thatâ€ in Meklerâ€™s\r\n  yard.Â  Bubba ran into the street and yelled that he was not in the yard and\r\n  asked what Mekler was â€œgoing to do now.â€Â  Mekler told him she would call the\r\n  police.Â  Bubba continued to yell at them.Â  Mekler told him she kept a gun and\r\n  Bubba replied, â€œBring it on.â€Â  Bubba then got in his truck and left.Â  Robette,\r\n  who had gone back to the porch and sat down, stated that Bubba was expecting\r\n  her to â€œgo up there.â€Â  Mekler advised Robette she should not go, but should\r\n  give Bubba time to cool down.Â  About five minutes later, Bubba walked into\r\n  Meklerâ€™s yard and started yelling again.Â  Mekler told Bubba he needed to go\r\n  home.Â  Mekler then went to her bedroom and got the shotgun, moving it to her\r\n  living room, but did not take it outside.Â  When she went back outside, Bubba\r\n  started coming up the walk and Meklerâ€™s dog was â€œgoing crazy.â€Â  Mekler told\r\n  Bubba to stop because the dog would bite him.Â  Mekler grabbed the dog, and that\r\n  is when she saw a knife in Bubbaâ€™s hand.Â  Mekler told Bubba he could not come\r\n  up there with a knife in his hand.Â  Bubba stated the knife was for the dog.Â \r\n  Mekler told him â€œYou canâ€™t come on the porch with a knife in your hand like\r\n  that.â€Â  She told Bubba to leave again and that she would walk to the store and\r\n  call the police.Â  Mekler stated, however, that she was not going to leave to go\r\n  to the store because she was afraid of what Bubba might do to Robette.Â  Mekler\r\n  further stated that she was really afraid for both Robette and herself.Â  Mekler\r\n  turned around to get the gun, but before she did, she told Bubba to leave.Â  She\r\n  then retrieved the gun and brought it out on the porch.Â  Bubba was standing on\r\n  the walk, but was not as close as he was when Mekler went into the house.Â \r\n  Mekler stated, â€œHe wouldnâ€™t leave, and I wasnâ€™t trying to shoot him, and I didnâ€™t\r\n  mean for the gun to fire, but I did cock the gun, and I must have had my finger\r\n  on the trigger.Â  When the gun went off, it shocked me.Â  Robette said, Jackie,\r\n  you shot him.Â  I said, no, I didnâ€™t.Â  She said, yes, you did.Â  And I said,\r\n  thereâ€™s no way.â€Â  Robette again said that Bubba was shot and Mekler told her to\r\n  go call 9-1-1.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State presented the testimony of Robette Spires at the trial.Â  Robette\r\n  testified that she and Mekler were drinking alcohol on Meklerâ€™s front porch on\r\n  the night in question.Â  It was after dark when Bubba drove up to Meklerâ€™s house\r\n  in his pick-up truck.Â  Bubba got out of the truck and started hollering,\r\n  wanting to know why she had not called him back.Â  Robette stated Bubba â€œwas\r\n  crying, he was upset, it wasnâ€™t a violent, mean (sic).â€Â  He was asking why she\r\n  had not called him, why she was doing this, and why she would not come home.Â \r\n  Bubba came into the yard but did not come onto the porch.Â  Robette did not\r\n  remember Bubba ever cursing, threatening or putting his hands on either her or\r\n  Mekler.Â  Robette did not remember at what point the knife came out, but she did\r\n  remember Bubba saying it was for the dog.Â  During his first trip to the house\r\n  when Bubba was hollering and crying at Robette, Mekler started hollering back\r\n  at Bubba telling him to calm down, and if he did so, he could join them for a\r\n  drink.Â  At one point Mekler told Bubba, â€œYou canâ€™t be hollering here, you canâ€™t\r\n  scream, youâ€™ve got to go, Iâ€™m going to shoot you if you donâ€™t.â€Â  Robette\r\n  claimed she never had the chance to respond to Bubbaâ€™s questions because when\r\n  Bubba would scream, Mekler would scream.Â  Bubba finally got in his truck and\r\n  left, but a few minutes later, he came walking back up the street, apparently\r\n  having left his truck at Robetteâ€™s house.Â  When he returned, Bubba was still\r\n  crying and hollering, saying the same things as before.Â  Robette testified she\r\n  was embarrassed by Bubbaâ€™s behavior and then irritated because she could not\r\n  â€œget a word in between [Bubba and Mekler].â€Â  When Bubba came back the second\r\n  time, the dog was chained to the porch and was barking.Â  Bubba made it to the\r\n  steps, but could come no further because the dog would have reached him.Â  When\r\n  Mekler saw the knife, she told Bubba to put it away.Â  Bubba responded that the\r\n  knife was for the dog.Â  At that point, Robette claims she stood up and began\r\n  walking away, toward her home.Â  She did not remember seeing Mekler go inside to\r\n  get the shotgun, but she remembered seeing her come out with the gun.Â  Robette\r\n  stated she was leaving because Bubba and Mekler were hollering and she had â€œhad\r\n  enough.â€Â  She stated she did not think Mekler would use the shotgun.Â  At the\r\n  moment the shot was fired, Robette had stepped off the porch and was heading\r\n  away and did not actually see Mekler shoot Bubba.Â  Robette saw a flash of light\r\n  over her shoulder and as she turned, Bubba said, â€œShe shot me.â€Â  Bubba began\r\n  walking toward Robette.Â  He told her he loved her, and then fell to the\r\n  ground.Â  \r\nMekler\r\n  took the stand and testified in her own defense.Â  She stated that on the night of\r\n  the incident, she and Robette were on her porch talking when Bubba pulled into\r\n  her yard, jumped out of his truck, and began screaming and hollering at\r\n  Robette.Â  He was yelling, â€œWhy arenâ€™t you home, why are you here, why do you\r\n  keep doing this to me?â€Â  Robette walked down into the yard to talk to him, but\r\n  Bubba continued to scream and yell.Â  He started flailing around, and may have\r\n  hit the truck.Â  Mekler stated she became afraid Bubba was going to hit\r\n  Robette.Â  Mekler did not call the police because she did not have a phone, and\r\n  she did not walk to the store to use the phone because she was not going to\r\n  leave Robette â€œwith [Bubba] in that state.â€Â  At some point Bubba left, driving\r\n  down the street.Â  Robette and Mekler sat back down and Robette told Mekler Bubba\r\n  had pulled into Robetteâ€™s yard and that he was expecting Robette to come up\r\n  there.Â  Mekler told her not to go there yet, but to let him calm down, stating\r\n  to Robette that she was scared for Robette to go up there.Â  Robette then said\r\n  she would not go up there.Â  As they were sitting on the porch, Meklerâ€™s dog\r\n  â€œFuzzyâ€ began to bark.Â  Fuzzy was sitting in a chair and was chained to the\r\n  porch.Â  The dog got up and was â€œlooking in that directionâ€ barking when Robette\r\n  said, â€œthereâ€™s Bubba.â€Â  Mekler looked and observed Bubba walking quickly into\r\n  her yard, coming up the walk.Â  As Bubba reached the steps, Fuzzy jumped down\r\n  the steps and stopped Bubbaâ€™s momentum.Â  Mekler stepped down and grabbed Fuzzy\r\n  saying to Bubba, â€œWhat are you doing?Â  Have you lost your mind?â€Â  Bubba was\r\n  still screaming and hollering at Robette, â€œYouâ€™re going to come with me.Â  Why\r\n  are you still here?â€Â  Mekler told Bubba he needed to go home.Â  Bubba would not\r\n  back up any farther, so Mekler reached down to grab Fuzzy with her other hand.Â \r\n  As she did, she noticed the knife in Bubbaâ€™s hand.Â  Mekler asked Bubba, â€œWhat\r\n  is wrong with you?Â  You pull a knife on me?â€Â  Bubba replied the knife was for\r\n  the dog.Â  Mekler then stated, â€œBubba, the dog is between me and you.â€Â  Bubba\r\n  then said, â€œWell, sheâ€™s my wife, and . . . Iâ€™m going to get her.â€Â  Mekler\r\n  replied, â€œNo, youâ€™re not.â€Â  She told Bubba to calm down and that he needed to\r\n  go home.Â  She told him, â€œYou canâ€™t come on the porch like that, with a knife.â€Â \r\n  Bubba said, â€œThatâ€™s my wife and I will do what I want to with her.â€Â  Mekler\r\n  again told Bubba he would not, and that he needed to leave.Â  Mekler handed the\r\n  chain on Fuzzy to Robette.Â  Robette asked Bubba why he pulled a knife, and at\r\n  that point, Mekler stepped inside and got her shotgun.Â  Mekler testified she\r\n  retrieved the shotgun because there was no stopping Bubba, she had pleaded with\r\n  him to leave, he came back to her home on foot, she was scared, and he had told\r\n  her there was nothing that was going to stop him from coming on the porch.Â \r\n  When Mekler came back out with the shotgun, Bubba had stepped back about a\r\n  foot.Â  She had already told Bubba earlier that she kept a loaded gun, and he\r\n  was still standing there, holding the knife.Â  Mekler told him to â€œplease go\r\n  home.â€Â  Bubba stated that he was not going anywhere, he was going to come up on\r\n  the porch, and he was going to get Robette and did not mind going through\r\n  Mekler to get her.Â  Mekler stated she was really scared, and at some point, she\r\n  cocked the gun.Â  As she was cocking the gun, Bubba leaned to the right and the\r\n  gun fired.Â  Mekler stated she did not remember pulling the trigger.Â  Robette\r\n  said, â€œJackie, you shot him.â€Â  Mekler told her, â€œNo, I didnâ€™t.â€Â  Robette said,\r\n  â€œYes, you did.â€Â  Mekler again replied, â€œNo, I didnâ€™t.â€Â  When Robette again\r\n  stated that she had shot him, Mekler told Robette to call 9-1-1.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, the solicitor asked Mekler if she meant to shoot Bubba.Â \r\n  Mekler responded that she â€œmeant for [Bubba] to stop.â€Â  When asked again if she\r\n  meant to shoot him, Mekler stated, â€œI wanted to live.â€Â  She further stated, â€œI\r\n  would never want to shoot anybody.â€Â  The solicitor again asked her if she meant\r\n  to shoot Bubba.Â  Mekler testified that she got the gun, she cocked the hammer,\r\n  she wanted to live, and that she wanted Robette to live.Â  The solicitor again\r\n  asked Mekler whether she meant to shoot him or she did not mean to shoot him.Â \r\n  Mekler replied that she was scared, that Bubba would not stop, that Bubba\r\n  moved, â€œand then the gun fired.â€Â  Mekler stated that when she advised Bubba she\r\n  had a gun, she did not contemplate using it at that point, but was just trying\r\n  to scare him.Â  Neither did she contemplate using it when she went inside and\r\n  moved it from her bedroom to a place near the front door.Â  The solicitor asked\r\n  Mekler why she pointed the gun at Bubba with the hammer cocked back and her\r\n  finger on the trigger if she did not intend to shoot Bubba.Â  Mekler stated she\r\n  did not have the gun at shoulder level and did not have it pointed at him.Â \r\n  Rather, she claimed she had the gun resting on her hip in order to cock the\r\n  hammer back.Â  When asked by the solicitor if she was â€œdefending this case on\r\n  the grounds that [she] had to kill him, Mekler replied, â€œYes.â€Â  The solicitor\r\n  then stated, â€œyouâ€™re telling me that you didnâ€™t mean to shoot him, and that you\r\n  had the gun down here?â€Â  Mekler replied that she was trying to cock the gun.Â \r\n  The solicitor stated Mekler must have had her finger on the trigger and Mekler\r\n  replied that her finger must have slipped â€œand got on the trigger,â€ and that\r\n  she did not remember pulling the trigger.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Failure to allow evidence to impeach Robette\r\nMekler\r\n  first contends the trial judge erred in failing to allow her to impeach\r\n  Robette, after Robette denied on the stand that she had ever been afraid of\r\n  Bubba, with evidence Robette told a police officer during a prior dispute that\r\n  she was afraid of Bubba and that Bubba had threatened to kill Robette.Â  Mekler\r\n  argues the evidence was relevant to the credibility of Robette and therefore\r\n  the trial judge erroneously excluded the evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring\r\n  defense counselâ€™s cross-examination of Robette, he asked if it was her\r\n  testimony that she was not afraid of Bubba the night of the shooting.Â  Robette\r\n  replied that she was not.Â  She testified she was mad at him for hollering at\r\n  her, but she was not scared.Â  Counsel then asked Robette if she had been scared\r\n  of Bubba before.Â  Robette denied that she had ever been scared of him, claiming\r\n  she had only been mad at him.Â  At this point, the trial judge excused the jury\r\n  and counsel informed the court he wished to inquire about an incident at\r\n  Robetteâ€™s home on December 29, 2001, about two months and nine days prior to\r\n  this shooting incident.Â  When the court inquired as to the relevance, counsel\r\n  stated Robette had testified she was never afraid of Bubba, but he had a report\r\n  that clearly stated that she was, and the issue was relevant to Robetteâ€™s\r\n  credibility.Â  The court then allowed counsel to proffer the evidence.Â  Robette\r\n  testified in an in camera hearing that her mother had been the one to call the\r\n  authorities the past December.Â  Robette admitted she told the officer that\r\n  Bubba had threatened to kill her, but denied telling him she was afraid for her\r\n  life.Â  She stated she had explained to the officer that she was angry because\r\n  Bubba put a hole in her door.Â  She stated Bubba was drunk at the time, but she\r\n  was not scared of him.Â  When counsel began to read from a police report on the\r\n  incident that Robette indicated she was frightened of Bubba, the court cut\r\n  counsel off, telling him the issue was an ancillary issue that had nothing to\r\n  do with the issues in the case.Â  \r\nCounsel\r\n  again argued to the court that the issue went to Robetteâ€™s credibility and\r\n  asked to proffer the officerâ€™s testimony.Â  Detective McCord then testified in\r\n  camera, stating he remembered going to Robetteâ€™s home on December 29, 2001.Â \r\n  Robette told him that Bubba had threatened to kill her and that she was\r\n  afraid.Â  When Bubba returned to the home he was very boisterous and, using\r\n  profanity, said he wanted Robette to come outside.Â  At that point, Detective\r\n  McCord placed Bubba under arrest for criminal domestic violence.Â  Bubba was\r\n  subsequently convicted as charged.Â  The trial judge ruled it was a collateral\r\n  issue, it could unduly lengthen the trial, and it might confuse the jury.Â  He\r\n  determined it had no bearing on any issue in the case at that time and refused\r\n  admission of the evidence based on Rule 403, SCRE.[2]Â \r\n  Robetteâ€™s cross-examination resumed and she testified that Bubba was not\r\n  vicious and was not â€œnormally a violent person of any kind.â€Â  She claimed that\r\n  his beating on her door was the worst thing Bubba had ever done and it made her\r\n  angry, but he was drunk at the time and he was not a violent person.Â  \r\nOn appeal,\r\n  Mekler contends the trial judge erred in excluding the impeachment evidence.Â \r\n  She argues the evidence was admissible under Rule 608(c), SCRE, and because it\r\n  was proper cross-examination under the rule, the trial judge abused his\r\n  discretion in denying its admission.Â  We disagree.Â  First it must be noted that\r\n  Rule 608(c) provides, â€œBias, prejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be\r\n  shown to impeach the witness either by examination of the witness or by\r\n  evidence otherwise adduced.â€Â  Here, Mekler did not proffer the evidence to show\r\n  â€œbias, prejudice, or any motive to misrepresentâ€ on the part of Robette.Â \r\n  Rather, counsel continuously stated he was offering the evidence to generally\r\n  attack Robetteâ€™s credibility.Â  Thus, Mekler cannot rely on Rule 608(c) to show\r\n  the evidence was proper.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we note case law supports our finding that the trial judge committed no error\r\n  in denying the admission of this evidence.Â  In State v. Beckham, 334\r\n  S.C. 302, 320-21, 513 S.E.2d 606, 615 (1999), appellant asserted on appeal that\r\n  the trial judge erred in excluding impeachment evidence of certain phone calls\r\n  conceivably made by a witness to a Myrtle Beach business after the witness\r\n  testified that he had not been in contact with anyone from that business for a\r\n  year or more prior to the trial.Â  Appellant wanted to impeach the witness with\r\n  these phone records.Â  Our Supreme Court found no error in the exclusion of\r\n  evidence of the telephone calls holding â€œ[w]hen a witness denies an act\r\n  involving a matter collateral to the case in chief, the inquiring party is not\r\n  permitted to introduce contradictory evidence to impeach the witness.â€Â  Id. at 321, 513 S.E.2d at 615.Â  In the case at hand, because Robette denied she had\r\n  ever been scared of Bubba, and because this was a matter collateral to the case\r\n  in chief, there was no error in the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to allow Mekler to\r\n  introduce contradictory evidence to impeach Robette.\r\nII. Refusal to allow evidence of appellantâ€™s knowledge of decedentâ€™s\r\nprior act of violence\r\nMekler\r\n  next contends the trial judge erred in refusing to allow evidence that Mekler\r\n  was aware of Bubbaâ€™s prior act of violence against Robette and Robetteâ€™s\r\n  property, arguing the evidence was relevant to Meklerâ€™s claim of self-defense\r\nand defense of others.Â  We agree.\r\nDuring\r\n  direct-examination, Mekler testified she knew of Bubbaâ€™s reputation for peace\r\n  and good order and that it was both good and bad.Â  Counsel then asked Mekler\r\n  whether she was aware of an incident thatÂ  occurred as a result of which Bubba\r\n  was convicted of criminal domestic violence.Â  Mekler testified that she was aware\r\n  of it.Â  On cross-examination, the solicitor questioned Mekler about the events\r\n  of the night of the shooting.Â  He asked Mekler why she did not simply go inside\r\n  her home and lock her door during the incident with Bubba.Â  Mekler responded,\r\n  â€œbecause I knew he would beat in my door, too, and come in.â€Â  When asked by the\r\n  solicitor if locking the door and having the shotgun in the house would not\r\nhave helped, Mekler stated it would not, because â€œa door would not stop him.â€Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  his redirect-examination of Mekler, defense counsel asked to proffer some\r\n  testimony from Mekler regarding her specific knowledge of Bubba having broken\r\n  the door in Robetteâ€™s home.Â  The trial judge indicated he would allow the\r\n  proffer, but he would not let the evidence go before the jury because it was a\r\n  collateral issue that would unduly lengthen the trial and was not necessary to\r\n  any issue in the case.Â  He noted he had allowed Mekler to testify that she was\r\n  aware of Bubbaâ€™s criminal domestic violence conviction, but he would not allow\r\n  evidence of the details of the crime.Â  Thereafter, counsel proffered testimony\r\n  from Mekler that she first became aware of the criminal domestic violence\r\n  incident involving Bubba and Robette when she heard Bubba â€œbeating in\r\n  [Robetteâ€™s] doorâ€ from her house.Â  She later learned Bubba had been drinking\r\n  when he went to Robetteâ€™s house, threatened Robette, and beat Robetteâ€™s door\r\n  until he broke through it with his fists.Â  She became aware that Bubba was\r\n  arrested for the incident and was later convicted.Â  The trial judge stated, â€œI\r\nspecifically decline to permit that testimony.â€Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 535 S.E.2d 431 (2000), our Supreme Court found the\r\n  trial judge committed reversible error by excluding testimony of a past violent\r\n  act that was closely related in time and occasion to the homicide in that\r\n  case.Â  Specifically, Day, who was claiming self-defense in his prosecution for\r\n  the murder of Renew, sought to introduce evidence that Renew had previously\r\n  held a gun to the head of witness Szumowicz for eighteen hours as he drove\r\n  around Aiken County, accusing Szumowicz of being involved with others in a drug\r\n  trafficking scheme at his residence.Â  Id. at 420, 535 S.E.2d at 436.Â \r\n  The trial judge ruled that specific instances of Renewâ€™s conduct were inadmissible,\r\n  but allowed Szumowiczâ€™s opinion testimony as to whether Renew was a violent\r\n  person.Â  Id.Â  The Supreme Court stated that â€œ[i]n the murder prosecution\r\n  of one pleading self-defense against an attack by the deceased, evidence of\r\n  other specific instances of violence on the part of the deceased are not\r\n  admissible unless they were directed against the defendant or, if directed\r\n  against others, were so closely connected at point of time or occasion with the\r\n  homicide as reasonably to indicate the state of mind of the deceased at the\r\n  time of the homicide, or to produce reasonable apprehension of great bodily\r\n  harm.â€Â  Id. at 419-20, 535 S.E.2d at 436.Â  The court noted that the\r\n  prior act of violence against Szumowicz occurred only four months prior to\r\n  Renewâ€™s death, and held the evidence was admissible to prove Day had a\r\n  reasonable apprehension of violence from Renew, an essential element of his\r\nself-defense claim.Â  Id. at 421, 535 S.E.2d at 437.\r\nIn the\r\n  case at hand, the prior act of violence by Bubba against Robette occurred less\r\n  than three months prior to Bubbaâ€™s death and was so closely connected at point\r\n  of time to indicate Bubbaâ€™s state of mind at the time of the shooting.Â  The\r\n  prior incident of criminal domestic violence was also admissible to prove\r\n  Mekler had a reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm from Bubba, an\r\n  essential element of Meklerâ€™s claim of self-defense as well as her claim of\r\ndefense of others. \r\nIII. Failure to charge the jury on the law of involuntary manslaughter\r\nMekler finally\r\n  contends the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  We agree.\r\nAt\r\n  the close of the evidence, defense counsel requested a jury instruction on\r\n  involuntary manslaughter.Â  The trial judge found there was a strong inference\r\n  from Meklerâ€™s testimony that she â€œcertainly intended to shoot [Bubba].â€Â  He\r\n  noted Mekler said she was afraid of Bubba and was protecting herself and quoted\r\n  Mekler as saying, â€œI meant to stop him.â€Â  The trial judge thus determined\r\n  involuntary manslaughter would be an inappropriate charge based on what he\r\n  â€œperceive[d] to be self-defense.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State\r\n    v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 51, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).Â  A trial court\r\n  should refuse to charge a lesser-included offense only where there is no\r\n  evidence the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.Â  State\r\n    v. Chatman, 336 S.C. 149, 152, 519 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1999).Â  Stated another\r\n  way, if there is any evidence from which the jury could infer the defendant\r\n  committed a lesser rather than a greater offense, the trial judge must charge\r\n  the lesser-included offense.Â  State v. White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605\r\n  S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004).Â  \r\nInvoluntary\r\n  manslaughter is (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but\r\n  while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or\r\n  great bodily harm;Â  or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice,\r\n  while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of\r\n  others.Â  Chatman, 336 S.C. at 152, 519 S.E.2d at 101.Â  A person can be\r\n  acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was\r\n  entitled to arm himself in self-defense at the time of the shooting.Â  Crosby, 355 S.C. at 52, 584 S.E.2d at 112;Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256,\r\n  262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  The negligent handling of a gun can support a\r\n  finding of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Burriss, 334 S.C. at 265, 513\r\n  S.E.2d at 109.\r\nHere,\r\n  there is evidence that would support a finding Mekler was lawfully armed in\r\n  self-defense at the time of the fatal shooting.Â  Further, there is ample\r\n  evidence from which the jury could infer Mekler did not intentionally discharge\r\n  the shotgun.Â  Although Mekler stated on cross-examination that she had cocked\r\n  the gun and â€œmeant for [Bubba] to stop,â€ she clearly testified on direct that,\r\n  as she was cocking the gun, Bubba leaned to the right â€œand the gun fired.â€Â \r\n  Mekler specifically testified she did not remember pulling the trigger.Â  Mekler\r\n  also consistently maintained in her statements to police that she did not\r\n  remember pulling the trigger.Â  In her detailed statement taken at the Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Office, Mekler stated she was not trying to shoot Bubba, and did not mean for\r\n  the gun to fire. She indicated when the gun went off, it shocked her.Â  Mekler\r\n  also consistently stated that when Robette told Mekler she had shot Bubba,\r\n  Mekler replied in disbelief that she had not.Â  She further testified during\r\n  cross-examination that her finger must have slipped â€œand got on the trigger,â€\r\n  and that she did not remember pulling the trigger.Â  \r\nIn Crosby,\r\n  the facts showed Crosby was involved in an incident with a group of people when\r\n  the victim began charging at Crosby with his hand behind his back.Â  Crosby indicated that he pulled out a gun, closed eyes and pulled the trigger, but he did\r\n  not know he pulled the trigger.Â  Crosby, 355 S.C. at 50, 584 S.E.2d at\r\n  111.Â  Our Supreme Court found, in spite of Crosbyâ€™s admission that he closed\r\n  his eyes and pulled the trigger, Crosby immediately added that he did not even\r\n  know that he pulled the trigger.Â  The fact that there may have been evidence\r\n  showing the shooting was intentional did not negate the other inferences that\r\n  could be drawn from all the evidence.Â  Thus, the court found Crosby was\r\n  entitled to a jury charge on the law of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Id. at 53, 584 S.E.2d at 112-13.Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  likewise hold, given the evidence adduced at trial, Mekler was entitled to have\r\n  the jury charged on the law of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Because there is\r\n  evidence from which the jury could have inferred Mekler did not intentionally\r\n  discharge the shotgun, the trial judge erroneously concluded an involuntary\r\n  manslaughter charge was precluded by Meklerâ€™s self-defense claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the trial judge\r\n  erred in excluding testimony of the past violent act by Bubba that was closely\r\n  related in time and occasion to the shooting death of Bubba.Â  We further hold\r\n  the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on the law of involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  For the foregoing reasons, Meklerâ€™s murder conviction isÂ Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON\r\nand WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]After the initial statement to the first officer on\r\n  the scene, Mekler was advised of her rights before any further statements were\r\n  given by her, and there is no issue as to the voluntariness of any of her\r\nstatements.Â  \r\n[2]This rule provides, â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may\r\n  be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\r\n  considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\r\ncumulative evidence.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4036","title":"State v.

Longtin, of Walterboro, for Respondent Lorenzo Victoria Reyes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â Victor Pichardo and Lorenzo Victoria Reyes were indicted for trafficking in heroin.Â  Prior to trial, Pichardo and Reyes made separate and identical motions to suppress drug evidence discovered in the search of Reyesâ€™ automobile.Â  The circuit judge granted the motions.Â  The State appeals the order suppressing the drug evidence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn September 18, 2002, Pichardo and Reyes were traveling north on I-95 in a vehicle owned by Reyes.Â  Pichardo was driving the vehicle and Reyes was in the front passenger seat.Â  Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Christopher Stevers stopped the vehicle â€œ[f]or failure to maintain a lane.â€Â  Pichardo told Stevers that Reyes owned the vehicle and that he was driving because Reyes was sleepy.\r\nDeputy Stevers called Deputy William G. Polk for backup.Â  Stevers asked Polk if he could speak Spanish to assist the interrogation.\r\nDeputy Stevers requested Pichardoâ€™s license.Â  Pichardo stated he left his license at home.Â  Pichardo informed Stevers that he and Reyes were traveling from Miami to New York City.Â  Stevers advised Pichardo that he was going to give him â€œa warning ticket for no license.â€Â  Stevers asked Pichardo to exit the vehicle and stand behind the trunk so he could give him the warning ticket.\r\nDeputy Stevers then approached Reyes and asked for his license and the vehicle registration, which Reyes handed to Stevers.Â  Deputy Stevers â€œnoticed a lot of nervousness about Mr.Â  Reyes while he was sitting in the front seat of the car.â€Â  Stevers asked Reyes to exit the vehicle and stand behind the trunk with Pichardo.Â  Stevers instructed Reyes that he would have to drive since Pichardo did not have his driverâ€™s license with him. \r\nReyes related to Stevers that he and Pichardo had been in Miami and were driving to New York, where they live.Â  Reyes walked to the rear of the car to exchange positions with Pichardo as driver.Â  At that time, Deputy Stevers: (1) told the men to have a good day and be careful; (2) shook Pichardoâ€™s hand; (3) returned their paperwork; and (4) turned away from the men.Â  Stevers then turned back around and â€œasked [Pichardo and Reyes] if [he] could ask them a question and they both turned to [him].â€Â  Stevers â€œexplained to them the situation that we have on I-95, especially since 9-11, with persons running illegal contraband up and down the highway and weapons and so forth . . . and then asked both of them for consent to search the vehicle.â€Â  Stevers declared Pichardo and Reyes â€œboth nodded in the affirmative.â€Â  Pichardo claimed he â€œtold [Stevers], I got no problem with that but this is not my car.â€\r\nAfter Deputy Polk arrived, he initiated a pat-down of Pichardo and Reyes for safety purposes.Â  Deputy Polk asked Pichardo and Reyes if they had a â€œpistola.â€Â  Polk stated: â€œThatâ€™s what I normally do when I have Spanish persons.â€\r\nDuring the search of the vehicle, Stevers discovered â€œa kiloâ€ of heroin hidden inside the right rear passenger door.\r\nAt the suppression hearing, Pichardo testified that Reyes â€œdonâ€™t speak English at all.â€Â  Pichardo professed that, when he and Reyes are together, Pichardo â€œtalk[s] most of the time for him because he donâ€™t understand [English].â€Â  Pichardo, who speaks English, said Reyes does not use English except for an occasional request for a cigarette or â€œa couple of wordsâ€ like â€œyes or no but understanding any conversation at all is difficult.â€Â  Pichardo was not asked to translate anything for Reyes when the stop occurred.Â  According to Pichardo, when Reyes joined him at the rear of the vehicle, Reyes asked Pichardo â€œwhat the officer was asking.â€Â  Pichardo told Reyes that Deputy Stevers â€œwas trying to argue permission to search the car.â€Â  Pichardo informed Reyes he told the deputy that he did not object to the search but that the car belonged to Reyes.Â  Pichardo claimed Stevers did not ask Reyes for consent to search.Â  Pichardo declared Stevers â€œwent straight to the car.â€\r\nSharon Folk, an interpreter and expert in Spanish language and Spanish culture and a professor at the University of South Carolina, Salkehatchie campus, opined that Reyes spoke little or no English, did not â€œunderstandâ€ English and had a very limited education.\r\nReyes testified, through an interpreter, that he speaks â€œvery littleâ€ English.Â  He explained he could not understand any of the questions Stevers asked him.Â  He stated that, on the day he was stopped on the interstate, no one asked him for permission to search his vehicle.Â  Reyes declared he â€œdidnâ€™t know that they were going to look in the car.â€Â  When asked if he gave the police permission to search his car, Reyes replied: â€œNo, because I didnâ€™t understand what they were saying.â€Â  Reyes is originally from the Dominican Republic and has maintained a permanent residence in the United States for only three years.\r\nReyes presented affidavits from several inmates that were in the Colleton County jail with him.Â  These affidavits attested to Reyesâ€™ reliance on Spanish for communication.\r\nDeputy Stevers testified regarding his conversation with Reyes.Â  When Stevers asked Reyes for the vehicle registration, Reyes handed it to him.Â  While sitting in the vehicle, Reyes related that he and Pichardo had been visiting family in Miami and were driving to New York City.Â  Stevers stated that, when he asked if he could search the vehicle, Reyes â€œnodded in the affirmative and said yes or something to that effect.â€Â  Stevers opined that Reyes â€œunderstood what [he] was asking for.â€\r\nAt the hearing, the Solicitor stipulated Deputy Stevers did not tell Pichardo and Reyes they were free to leave.Â  The Solicitor declared: â€œYour Honor, now that Iâ€™ve reviewed my report here, I had another case that Stevers was involved in, and I believe your recollection is correct here that he told him to have a good day.Â  He did not say youâ€™re free to go.â€Â  Stevers testified: â€œI told [Pichardo] to have a good day, they were free to go.â€\r\nA stipulation is an agreement, admission or concession made in judicial proceedings by the parties thereto or their attorneys.Â  Porter v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 333 S.C. 12, 507 S.E.2d 328 (1998); Kirkland v. Allcraft Steel Co., 329 S.C. 389, 496 S.E.2d 624 (1998); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp. v. Richardson, 335 S.C. 278, 516 S.E.2d 3 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Stipulations are binding upon those who make them.Â  Id.; see also Webster v. Holly Hill Lumber Co., 268 S.C. 416, 234 S.E.2d 232 (1977) (stating a stipulation is an agreement, an understanding, that is to be construed like a contract, to effect the intent of the parties); State v. Anderson, 318 S.C. 395, 399-400, 458 S.E.2d 56, 58 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œGenerally, a stipulation is an agreement between the parties to which there must be mutual assent.â€);Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1415 (6th ed. 1990) (defining a stipulation as a â€œ[v]oluntary agreement between opposing counsel concerning disposition of some relevant point so as to obviate need for proof or to narrow range of litigable issues.â€).Â  The court must accept stipulations as binding upon the parties.\r\nAfter hearing oral arguments and reviewing briefs and video evidence, the circuit judge found â€œthe stop was legal and the defendant[s] properly detained.â€Â  The judge concluded the search was â€œan exploitation of the original stop.â€Â  He ruled â€œthere was no reasonable suspicion to further detain or question [Pichardo and Reyes] after Pichardo was given the warning ticket.â€Â  The judge determined: â€œI find that [voluntary consent] has not been shown here even by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  As such, I cannot infer voluntary consent and must find that no such voluntary consent was given and that the search is invalid.â€Â  Finally, the judge held the search was improper because it was â€œnot based upon probable cause or suspicion and was still with the scope of the traffic stop and exploitive of that stop . . .; and that no voluntary consent by Reyes, the foreign speaking owner of the vehicle was ever obtained.â€Â  The judge suppressed all evidence obtained in the search of Reyesâ€™ automobile.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate standard of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 528 S.E.2d 661 (2000); State v. Jones, 364 S.C. 51, 610 S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 532 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The appellate court may only reverse where there is clear error.Â  Id.; see also State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001) (holding in a criminal case the appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of\r\ncertain evidence unless the findings are clearly erroneous, and its review extends only to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion).\r\nThe â€œclear errorâ€ standard means that an appellate court will not reverse a trial courtâ€™s finding of fact simply because it would have decided the case differently.Â  Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234 (2001).Â  Rather, the appellate court must ask whether, on the entire evidence, it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.Â  Id.\r\nAn appellate court must affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling if there is any evidence to support the ruling.Â  Brockman, 339 S.C. at 66, 528 S.E.2d at 666.Â  Accordingly, we will apply an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard to the circuit judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  See State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Right to Appeal\r\nInitially, we determine whether the State has the right to appeal the judgeâ€™s order suppressing the drug evidence.\r\nIn South Carolina, the Stateâ€™s right to appeal is defined by our judicial decisions, not statutory law.Â  State v. McKnight, 353 S.C. 238, 577 S.E.2d 456 (2003).Â  Thus, the Stateâ€™s right to appeal in a criminal case is a judicially created right.Â  State v. Belviso, 360 S.C. 112, 600 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nOur Supreme Court has recognized limited situations where the State may appeal.Â  State v. Holliday, 255 S.C. 142, 177 S.E.2d 541 (1970).Â  A pre-trial order granting the suppression of evidence which significantly impairs the prosecution of a criminal case is directly appealable.Â  State v. Mabe, 306 S.C. 355, 412 S.E.2d 386 (1991); State v. McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, 337 S.E.2d 208 (1985); State v. Henry, 313 S.C. 106, 432 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 1993); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1977) (â€œThe Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal . . . [a]n order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order . . . in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action.â€).Â  The State has the right to immediately appeal a trial courtâ€™s suppression of evidence which significantly impairs the prosecution of the case.Â  Belviso, 360 S.C. at 115, 600 S.E.2d at 70.\r\nThere is no direct statement emanating from the State in regard to an allegation that the order will significantly impair the prosecution of its case.Â  However, factually and legally, if this court affirms the order of the circuit judge, the prosecution of the case against Pichardo and Reyes is eviscerated and annihilated.\r\nII.Â  Search of Reyesâ€™ Vehicle\r\nThe State argues the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence obtained from a search of Reyesâ€™ vehicle.Â  The State claims the courtâ€™s findings that the search exploited the traffic stop and there was no voluntary consent by Reyes are not supported by the record.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œ[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend IV; see State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 544 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Thus, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, including seizures that involve only a brief detention.Â  United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544 (1980).\r\nTemporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a seizure of persons within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.Â  Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996); State v. Maybank, 352 S.C. 310, 573 S.E.2d 851 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, an automobile stop is â€œsubject to the constitutional imperative that it not be â€˜unreasonableâ€™ under the circumstances.â€Â  Whren, 517 U.S. at 810.Â  Where probable cause exists to believe that a traffic violation has occurred, the decision to stop the automobile is reasonable per se.Â  Id.Â  The police may also stop and briefly detain a vehicle if they have a reasonable suspicion that the occupants are involved in criminal activity.Â  State v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 539 S.E.2d 414 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe testimony of Deputy Stevers was that he stopped the vehicle because Pichardo failed to maintain his lane.Â  This evidence was not challenged.Â  The vehicle was legally stopped and Pichardo and Reyes detained.Â  However, Pichardo and Reyes contend that, once the traffic stop was concluded, Deputy Stevers needed a reasonable suspicion that some further criminal activity was afoot in order to begin questioning Pichardo and Reyes.\r\nOnce a motor vehicle is detained lawfully for a traffic violation, the police may order the driver to exit the vehicle without violating Fourth Amendment proscriptions on unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106 (1977); State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In carrying out the stop, an officer may request a driverâ€™s license and vehicle registration, run a computer check, and issue a citation.Â  United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126 (4th Cir. 1998).Â  However, any further detention for questioning is beyond the scope of the stop and therefore illegal unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion of a serious crime.Â  Id.\r\nAn investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop and the scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification.Â  Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983).Â  The officerâ€™s purpose in an ordinary traffic stop is to enforce the laws of the roadway, and ordinarily to investigate the manner of driving with the intent to issue a citation or warning.Â  Ferris v. State, 735 A.2d 491 (Md. 1999).Â  Once the purpose of that stop has been fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a second detention.Â  Id.; see also United States v. Jones, 234 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir. 2000) (â€œThe basis for the stop was essentially completed when the dispatcher notified the officers about the defendantsâ€™ clean records, three minutes before the officers sought consent to search the vehicle. Accordingly, the officers should have ended the detention and allowed the defendants to leave. And the failure to release the defendants violated the Fourth Amendment.â€); United States v. Mesa, 62 F.3d 159, 162 (6th Cir. 1995) (â€œOnce the purposes of the initial traffic stop were completed, there is no doubt that the officer could not further detain the vehicle or its occupants unless something that occurred during the traffic stop generated the necessary reasonable suspicion to justify a further detention.â€); United States v. Beck, 140 F.3d 1129, 1136 (8th Cir. 1998) (â€œBecause the purposes of [the officerâ€™s] initial traffic stop of Beck had been completed . . . [the officer] could not subsequently detain Beck unless events that transpired during the traffic stop gave rise to reasonable suspicion to justify [the officerâ€™s] renewed detention of Beck.â€); People v. Redinger, 906 P.2d 81, 85-86 (Colo. 1995) (â€œWhen, as here, the purpose for which the investigatory stop was instituted has been accomplished and no other reasonable suspicion exists to support further investigation, there is no justification for continued detention and interrogation of citizens.â€); Davis v. State, 947 S.W.2d 240, 243 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (â€œ[O]nce the reason for the stop has been satisfied, the stop may not be used as a â€˜fishing expedition for unrelated criminal activity.â€™â€) (citations omitted).\r\nOnce the underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded, it does not automatically follow that any further detention for questioning is unconstitutional.Â  Fourth Amendment jurisprudence clarified:\r\n\r\nLengthening the detention for further questioning beyond that related to the initial stop is permissible in two circumstances. First, the\r\nofficer may detain the driver for questioning unrelated to the initial stop if he has an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion illegal activity has occurred or is occurring.Â  Second, further questioning unrelated to the initial stop is permissible if the initial detention has become a consensual encounter.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Hunnicutt, 135 F.3d 1345, 1349 (10th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).Â  Thus, a law enforcement officerâ€™s continued questioning of a vehicleâ€™s driver and passenger outside the scope of a valid traffic stop passes muster under the Fourth Amendment either when the officer has a reasonable articulable suspicion of other illegal activity or when the valid traffic stop has become a consensual encounter.\r\nThe question in this case is whether Deputy Stevers detained, i.e. â€œseizedâ€ Pichardo and Reyes anew, thereby triggering the Fourth Amendment or simply initiated a consensual encounter invoking no constitutional scrutiny.Â  See State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002); see also Ferris, 735 A.2d at 500 (stating the difficult question was whether the trooperâ€™s questioning of Ferris after he issued a citation and returned his driverâ€™s license and registration â€œconstituted a detention, and hence raise[d] any Fourth Amendment concerns, or was merely a â€˜consensual encounter[]â€™ . . . implicating no constitutional overviewâ€).\r\nA consensual encounter has been defined as simply the voluntary cooperation of a private citizen in response to non-coercive questioning by a law enforcement official.Â  Ferris, 735 A.2d at 500 n.4; Williams, 351 S.C. at 599 n.2, 571 S.E.2d at 708 n.2.Â  Because an individual is free to leave at any time during such an encounter, he is not â€œseizedâ€ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.Â  Id.\r\nMere police questioning does not constitute a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes.Â  Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991); see State v. Culbreath, 300 S.C. 232, 237, 387 S.E.2d 255, 257 (1990) (â€œNot all personal encounters between policemen and citizens involve â€˜seizuresâ€™ of persons thereby bringing the Fourth Amendment into play.â€) (citations omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990).Â  To the contrary, â€œ[o]nly when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a â€˜seizureâ€™ has occurred.â€Â  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19-20 n.16 (1968).Â  As long as a person remains at liberty to disregard a police officerâ€™s request for information, no constitutional interest is implicated.Â  United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126 (4th Cir. 1998); Williams, 351 S.C. at 600, 571 S.E.2d at 708.\r\nThe test for determining if a particular encounter constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment is whether in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.Â  Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567 (1988); United States v. Analla, 975 F.2d 119 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Sullivan, 138 F.3d at 132 (â€œThe test . . . [is] whether, under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, a reasonable person in the suspectâ€™s position â€˜would have felt free to decline the officerâ€™s requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.â€™â€) (citations omitted).Â  So long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that personâ€™s liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective justification.Â  United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544 (1980).Â  The test is necessarily imprecise, because it is designed to assess the coercive effect of police conduct taken as a whole.Â  Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 573; Williams, 351 S.C. at 600, 571 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Thus, exactly what constitutes a restraint on liberty sufficient to lead a reasonable person to conclude he is not free to leave varies with the setting in which the police conduct occurs.Â  Id.\r\nReasonableness is measured in objective terms by examining the totality of the circumstances.Â  Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33 (1996); Williams, 351 S.C. at 600, 571 S.E.2d at 708.Â  As a result, the nature of the reasonableness inquiry is highly fact-specific.Â  Id.Â  Although no single factor dictates whether a seizure has occurred, courts have identified certain probative factors, including the time and place of the encounter, the existence and nature of any prior seizure, whether there was a clear and expressed endpoint to any such prior detention, the number of officers present and whether they were uniformed, the length of the detention, whether the officer moved the person to a different location or isolated him from others, whether the officer informed the person he was free to leave, whether the officer indicated to the person that he was suspected of a crime, and whether the officer retained the personâ€™s documents or exhibited threatening behavior or physical contact.Â  See United States v. Beck, 140 F.3d 1129 (8th Cir. 1998); Ferris v. State, 735 A.2d 491 (Md. 1999).\r\nIn determining whether Pichardo and Reyes were seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, it must be noted that the detention associated with roadside searches is unlike a mere field interrogation where an officer may question an individual without grounds for suspicion.Â  See Williams, 351 S.C. at 600-01, 571 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Roadside consent searches are instead more akin to an investigatory stop that does involve a detention.Â  Id.Â  A traffic stop, or pre-existing seizure, enhances the coercive nature of the situation and the efficacy of the other factors in pointing toward the restriction of liberty.Â  Ferris, 735 A.2d at 502.Â  Such a situation, therefore, is â€œmarkedly different from that of a person passing by or approached by law enforcement officers on the street, in a public place, or inside the terminal of a common carrier.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).\r\nIn the instant case, Stevers returned the â€œpaperwork,â€ gave Pichardo his warning ticket, and told him to â€œhave a nice day.â€Â  The fact that the officer returned the driverâ€™s documentation is not always sufficient to demonstrate that an encounter has become consensual.Â  Daniel v. State, 597 S.E.2d 116 (Ga. 2004).Â  Thus, the return of documents does not conclusively establish that a traffic stop has de-escalated into a consensual encounter.Â  Id.\r\nThe Solicitor stipulated that Pichardo was never instructed that he and Reyes could leave.Â  It is well established that the Constitution does not require an officer to inform a motorist he is free to leave before obtaining consent.Â  See Robinette, 519 U.S. at 35 (rejecting per se rule that would render consent involuntary if an officer failed to advise a motorist he was free to go before requesting consent).Â  However, the Supreme Court in Robinette reiterated that such advice was one factor to consider in the overall analysis.Â  Id. at 39.Â  Significantly, in this case the State is bound by the stipulation that Stevers failed to tell Pichardo and Reyes they were free to leave.\r\nThe circumstances surrounding the encounter lend support to the circuit judgeâ€™s conclusion.Â  The two men were isolated while questioned. Stevers requested the two men separately step to the rear of Reyesâ€™ vehicle. Two uniformed police officers were present.Â  Pichardo and Reyes were physically searched.Â  There was an immediate transition from the valid traffic stop to the search such that they may not have realized the initial seizure was over.Â  At this point, the â€œencounter began to assume the tenor of an investigation.â€Â  See Williams, 351 S.C. at 602, 571 S.E.2d at 709.Â  Pichardo and Reyes were detained beyond the traffic stop.Â  The facts encompassing Steversâ€™ questioning of Pichardo and Reyes support the conclusion that the men were in fact seized.\r\nThese circumstances were sufficiently intimidating such that Pichardo and Reyes â€œcould reasonably have believed that [they were] not free to disregard the police presence and go about [their] business.â€Â  See Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 576 (1988); see also People v. In Interest of H.J., 931 P.2d 1177, 1181 (Colo. 1997) (â€œIt strains credulity to imagine that any citizen, directly on the heels of having been pulled over to the side of the road by armed and uniformed police officers in marked patrol cars, would ever feel â€˜free to leaveâ€™ or â€˜at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.â€™â€) (citations omitted); Ferris, 735 A.2d at 502-03 (enumerating several factors that transmuted a valid traffic stop into an unlawful detention, including the trooperâ€™s failure to inform Ferris he was free to leave, the trooperâ€™s â€œrequestâ€ that Ferris step â€œto the back of his vehicle to answer a couple of questions,â€ the detention seamlessly followed a pre-existing lawful stop, the trooper removed Ferris from his automobile and separated him from his passenger, the presence of two uniformed law enforcement officers, and the fact that the police cruiser emergency flashers remained operative throughout the entire encounter) (footnote omitted).\r\nDeputy Stevers, by prolonging the initial stop beyond its proper scope, rendered the ensuing encounter more coercive than consensual.Â  As the Ohio Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe transition between detention and a consensual exchange can be so seamless that the untrained eye may not notice that it has occurred.Â  The undetectability of that transition may be used by police officers to coerce citizens into answering questions that they need not answer, or to allow a search of a vehicle that they are not legally obligated to allow.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Robinette, 685 N.E.2d 762, 770-71 (Ohio 1997); see Ferris, 735 A.2d at 503 (â€œThe moment at which a traffic stop concludes is often a difficult legal question, not readily discernible by a layperson. It is not sound to categorically impute to all drivers the constructive knowledge as to the precise moment at which, objectively, an initially lawful traffic stop terminates, i.e., the time at which the driver may depart.â€).Â  A traffic stop must have a distinct ending point which is ascertainable to both the officers charged with enforcing the law and the citizens whom they encounter.Â  Daniel v. State, 597 S.E.2d 116 (Ga. 2004).\r\nA routine stop constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure so that when the purpose justifying the stop is exceeded, the detention becomes illegal unless a reasonable suspicion of some other crime exists.Â  United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126 (4th Cir. 1998); see State v. Robinson, 306 S.C. 399, 402, 412 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1991) (â€œTo justify a brief stop [or] detention, the police officer must have a reasonable suspicion that the person has been involved in criminal activity.â€).Â  The term â€œreasonable suspicionâ€ requires a particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.Â  United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411 (1981); State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 544 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the whole picture must be considered.Â  United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1 (1989).Â  The burden is on the State to articulate facts sufficient to support reasonable suspicion.Â  State v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 539 S.E.2d 414 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nHere, the only evidence at the suppression hearing of reasonable suspicion was Deputy Steversâ€™ testimony that Reyes was nervous.Â  In light of Reyesâ€™ inability to speak English, nervousness alone is not sufficient to support reasonable suspicion of â€œsome other crime.â€Â  Sullivan, 138 F.3d at 131.Â  There was no reasonable suspicion of â€œsome other crimeâ€ to further detain or question Pichardo and Reyes after Pichardo was given the warning ticket.Â  Such a search at this point was an exploitation of the original stop rather than a separate and valid search based upon a reasonable suspicion.Â  When Deputy Stevers asked for consent, he detained anew, triggering the Fourth Amendment.Â  Pichardo and Reyes were unconstitutionally detained.\r\nWarrantless searches and seizures are reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when conducted under the authority of voluntary consent.Â  Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 511 S.E.2d 62 (1999).Â  Undoubtedly, a law enforcement officer may request permission to search at any time. However, when an officer asks for consent to search after an unconstitutional detention, the consent procured is per se invalid unless it is both voluntary and not an exploitation of the unlawful detention.Â  State v. Robinson, 306 S.C. 399, 412 S.E.2d 411 (1991); State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002); see Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487-88 (1963) (â€œWe need not hold that all evidence is â€˜fruit of the poisonous treeâ€™ simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.Â  Rather, the more apt question in such a case is â€˜whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.â€™â€) (citation omitted); Brown v. State, 372 S.E.2d 514, 516 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988) (â€œ[I]n order to eliminate any taint from an [illegal] seizure or arrest, there must be proof both that the consent was voluntary and that it was not the product of the illegal detention.â€).\r\nProof of a voluntary consent alone is not sufficient.Â  Williams, 351 S.C. at 604, 571 S.E.2d at 710; Brown, 372 S.E.2d at 516.Â  The relevant factors include the temporal proximity of the illegal seizure and consent, intervening circumstances, and the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.Â  Id.\r\nThe State bears the burden of establishing the voluntariness of the consent.Â  State v. Harris, 277 S.C. 274, 286 S.E.2d 137 (1982); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Whether a consent to search was voluntary is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003); Mattison, 352 S.C. at 584, 575 S.E.2d at 855.Â  The issue of voluntary consent, when contested by contradicting testimony, is an issue of credibility to be determined by the circuit judge.Â  Mattison, 352 S.C. at 584-85, 575 S.E.2d at 856.Â  A trial judgeâ€™s conclusions on issues of fact regarding voluntariness will not be disturbed on appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as to be an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  There is ample evidence in the record to support the circuit judgeâ€™s finding that the State failed to meet this burden and there was no voluntary consent to search.\r\nA plethora of evidence in the record buttresses the circuit judgeâ€™s determination that Pichardo and Reyes were unlawfully detained and that Reyesâ€™ purported consent to search was not voluntary.Â  Deputy Stevers initially testified that Reyes gave his consent to the search.Â  However, Stevers thereafter stated he needed to view the video to be certain Reyes responded to Steversâ€™ request to search with a â€œyes along with a nod.â€Â  Pichardo and Reyes declared no consent was given or understood by Reyes.Â  Pichardo professed he explained to Reyes what the officer had asked to do.Â  There was expert testimony that Reyes speaks little or no English, did not â€œunderstandâ€ English and had a very limited education.Â  Reyes submitted affidavits to the court from several inmates attesting to Reyesâ€™ reliance on Spanish for communication.Â  The Stevers video has no audio and was inconclusive in the video rendering of the confrontation. The Polk video had audio but did not include any exchange between Reyes and Stevers in which the consent is alleged.Â  The Stevers video clearly shows Stevers standing on the passengerâ€™s side of the vehicle talking across Reyes to Pichardo, who speaks English.Â  The incident report and testimony indicate that Deputy Stevers asked Deputy Polk if he could speak Spanish to assist the interrogation.\r\nThe standard of review by the appellate entity is to determine if â€œany evidenceâ€ exists in the record to support the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the circuit judge.Â  We affirm the circuit judge in his ruling that Reyes did not give voluntary consent and there was no valid consent to search the vehicle.\r\nMoreover, the record reveals that Reyesâ€™ consent was obtained through Deputy Steversâ€™s exploitation of the unlawful detention.Â  Steversâ€™s testimony before the trial court revealed that a minimal amount of time passed between the seizure and ensuing consent, there were no intervening or attenuating circumstances, and Steversâ€™s actions in detaining Pichardo and Reyes had no legal basis.Â  See Williams, 351 S.C. at 605, 571 S.E.2d at 711.Â  The record unquestionably supports the circuit judgeâ€™s finding that Reyesâ€™ consent was not valid.Â  See Robinson, 306 S.C. at 402, 412 S.E.2d at 414; see also Brown, 372 S.E.2d at 516 (â€œ[W]e find that there was no significant lapse of time between the unlawful detention and the consent, that no intervening circumstances dissipated the effect of the unlawful detention and that the deputyâ€™s conduct had no arguable legal basis.Â  Therefore, we hold that the consent was the product of the illegal detention, and that the taint of the unreasonable stop was not sufficiently attenuated.â€); State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000) (stating an appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe heroin found in Reyesâ€™ vehicle was discovered through an illegal detention accompanied by a lack of valid consent.Â  Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment and is inadmissible at trial.Â  State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 519 S.E.2d 786 (1999); State v. Flowers, 360 S.C. 1, 598 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The trial court, therefore, did not err in suppressing the evidence.Â  See State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 323, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996) (â€œThe â€˜fruit of the poisonous treeâ€™ doctrine provides that evidence must be excluded if it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police, and the evidence has been obtained by the exploitation of the illegality.â€); Robinson, 306 S.C. at 402, 412 S.E.2d at 414 (suppressing drug evidence as the fruit of an unlawful stop because no attenuating circumstances removed the taint of the illegality from the consent to search); State v. Greene, 330 S.C. 551, 559, 499 S.E.2d 817, 821 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œThe fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine holds that where evidence would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police, and the evidence has been obtained by the exploitation of that illegality, the evidence must be excluded.â€); People v. Brownlee, 713 N.E.2d 556 (Ill. 1999) (suppressing marijuana as fruit of an illegal detention, where officers legitimately stopped vehicle for investigation of a traffic violation but after returning driverâ€™s license and insurance card and stating no citation would be issued officers paused for a couple of minutes and then asked for and obtained consent to search the vehicle, because during this time the driver and his passengers were detained without reasonable suspicion of any criminal activity).\r\nAccordingly, the circuit judgeâ€™s order suppressing the drug evidence is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4037","title":"Eagle Container Co., LLC v.

Permitted uses listed in the District Use Tables in this division are permitted outright. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Conditional Uses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditional uses in the District Use Tables are permitted by the Zoning Administrator without further review upon compliance with the conditions specified in the tables.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Special Exceptions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special exceptions are permitted after review and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon compliance with the general conditions in the regulations . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nPrior to December 11, 2002, the Zoning Ordinance listed construction and demolition landfills (â€œC&amp;D landfillsâ€) under â€œspecial exceptionâ€ uses in R-2 Rural Districts.Â  Pursuant to section 501, a C&amp;D landfill would be permitted as a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ in R-2 Rural Districts: \r\n\r\n  [P]rovided the Board of Zoning Appeals determines: \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approvals shall be conditioned on the applicant receiving all state and federal approvals; \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All uses are a minimum of 1,000 feet from adjoining property lines;\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use would not constitute a safety hazard or traffic hazard;\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use is not detrimental to adjacent land uses in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 2002, the first reading of Ordinance No. 12-49-02 (â€œamending ordinanceâ€) occurred.Â  The minutes of Newberry County Council for November 6, 2002, provide:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Waldrop asked Ms. Bridges to explain [Ordinance No. 12-49-02].\r\n  Susan Bridges, Planning/Zoning Director, stated that on page 31 of the Zoning Ordinance, which is the list of Special Exception Uses in R-2, you will see landfill is listed as a permitted use under the Special Exceptions; however, when you look in Article 3, 301, you will see it is not listed there at all under the R-2 Rural Districts.Â  This has been a source of confusion for some applicants who were interested in finding out what was permitted in R-2 and where in particular landfills were permitted.Â  We thought it might need to be added as a clarification only.Â  It is not adding to the use to the district; the district already has that use as a Special Exception. \r\n\r\n On November 20, 2002, the second reading of the amending ordinance occurred.Â  The Council minutes provide then-acting Zoning Director, Susan Bridges, was asked to â€œtell Council in laymanâ€™s language exactly what doing [sic] [with the amending ordinance].â€Â  The Council minutes read: \r\n\r\n  Susan Bridges, Planning/Zoning Director, pointed out Article 3, Section 301, District Purpose.Â  There is a list of designing districts all established by the Ordinance and after them is basically a statement of purpose and a list of some of the major uses that are permitted in each of those districts.Â  The R-2 Rural District actually does allow landfills.Â  If you will look in the list of permitted uses in R-2 Rural District, it is listed as a special exception use that requires Board of Zoning Appeals hearing.Â  The approval for landfills shall be conditioned on the applicant receiving all state and federal approvals, all uses are a minimum of 1,000 feet from adjoining property lines, the use would not constitute a safety hazard or traffic hazard, and the use is not detrimental to adjacent land uses in the vicinity.Â  The Board of Zoning Appeals would have to hold a public hearing and find for all four of those factors before they could grant permission for a permit to be issued to an applicant. \r\n\r\nOn December 11, 2002, the Council adopted Ordinance No. 12-49-02 which provides:\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 12-24-01 permits various uses in R-2 Rural Districts; and\r\n  WHEREAS, landfills should be allowed in the R-2 Rural District.\r\n  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AS FOLLOWS:\r\n  Article 3, Section 301 is amended to add text â€œlandfillâ€ to the uses permitted in R-2 Rural District. The text is added to the Newberry County Zoning Ordinance . . . .â€\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 2003, Eagle Container Co., LLC applied for a permit from the County of Newberry to build a C&amp;D landfill on property in an R-2 Rural District of Newberry County.Â  Susan Berry, then-acting Newberry County Zoning Administrator, initially approved Eagle Containerâ€™s application.Â  On June 4, 2003, Newberry County revoked Eagle Containerâ€™s permit â€œon the ground that it was erroneously issued.â€ \r\nEagle Container commenced a declaratory judgment action on June 17, 2003, seeking an order rescinding the revocation of their landfill permit and reinstating their permit as originally approved.Â  Additionally, Eagle Container petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of a permit for the subject site.Â  Eagle Container and Newberry County filed cross motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court found Eagle Container was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and denied Newberry Countyâ€™s subsequent motion to reconsider. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56 (c) SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005); B&amp;B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E. 2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury. Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 608 S.E.2d 587 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 611 S.E.2d 485 (2005); BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 608 S.E.2d 155 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below. Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 607 S.E.2d 63 (2004); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 613 S.E.2d 533 (2005); Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C.1, 605 S.E.2d 744 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).Â The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings. Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder. Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (Ct. App. 2004); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues. Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E. 2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Interpretation of Legislative Intent\r\nA. Plain Meaning Rule\r\nNewberry County contends the trial court erred in using the â€œplain meaningâ€ rule to conclude that Eagle Container is entitled to summary judgment. Newberry County asserts the â€œplain meaningâ€ rule requires reading the amending ordinance as merely amending Article 3, section 301 to add â€œto the general statement of intent set forth in Article 3 to be used in the general interpretation and application of the Zoning Ordinance.â€Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.â€ Garvin v. State, 365 S.C. 16, 21, 615 S.E.2d 451, 453 (2005); Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 22, 579 S.E.2d 334, 336 (Ct. App. 2003); Knotts v. S.C. Dept of Natural Resources, 348 S.C. 1, 10, 558 S.E.2d 511, 516 (2002).Â  â€œThe primary purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€ Gordon v. Phillips Utils., Inc., 362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d 425, 427 (2005). \r\nâ€œâ€˜What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.â€™â€ Knotts, 348 S.C. at 10, 558 S.E.2d at 516 (quoting Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, Â§46.03 at 94 (5th Ed. 1992)); Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.â€ State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 102, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 366, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 338, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nâ€œThe first question of statutory interpretation is whether the statuteâ€™s meaning is clear on its face.â€ Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (citing Kennedy v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 549 S.E.2d 243 (2001)).Â  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the Court has no right to impose another meaning.â€ Vaughn v. Bernhardt, 345 S.C. 196, 198, 547 S.E.2d 869, 870 (2001) (citing Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000)). â€œ[T]he words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.â€ Municipal Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. AT&amp;T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004) (citing Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992)). Â â€œThe terms must be construed in context and their meaning determined by looking at the other terms used in the statute.â€ Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Southern Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Windstorm &amp; Hail Underwriting Assâ€™n, 306 S.C. 339, 412 S.E.2d 377 (1991)). Â â€œUnder the plain meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.â€ Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 231, 612 S.E.2d 719, 724 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Hodges, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578; Bayle, 344 S.C. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739).Â  â€œWhen the terms of a statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€ Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, 354 S.C. at 24, 579 S.E.2d at 337 (citing Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002); Holley v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994); Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. S.C.

Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 65, 456 S.E.2d 366, 367 (1995) (â€œWhere the terms of a relevant statute are clear, there is no room for construction.â€)). \r\nWe find the â€œplain meaningâ€ rule is applicable in the instant action and we do not need to resort to the rules of statutory construction because the language of the amending ordinance demonstrates the Council intended to make landfills a permitted use in R-2 Rural Districts.Â  The amending ordinance states that â€œlandfills should be allowed in the R-2 Rural Districtâ€ and the Zoning Ordinance should be â€œamended to add text â€˜landfillâ€™ to the uses permitted in R-2 Rural District.â€ (emphasis added).Â  The Councilâ€™s use of the term â€œpermittedâ€ is significant.Â  Section 201 (86) of the Zoning Ordinance defines the term â€œpermitted useâ€ as â€œa use permitted outright by district regulations.â€Â  In contrast, â€œspecial exceptionâ€ uses require approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals.Â  The terms â€œpermitted useâ€ and â€œspecial exceptionâ€ are mutually exclusive. This Court must assume Council understood the distinction between â€œpermittedâ€ uses and â€œspecial exceptionâ€ uses.Â  â€œThere is a presumption that the legislature has knowledge of previous legislation . . . when later statutes are enacted concerning related subjects.â€ State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 648, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003) (citing State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000); Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 426 S.E.2d 760 (1993)). Because the amending ordinance clearly and unambiguously states â€œlandfillâ€ is to be added to the uses â€œpermittedâ€ in an R-2 Rural District, we must interpret the amending ordinanceâ€™s plain language as changing landfill to a â€œpermitted use.â€ Therefore, we find the trial court did not err in granting Eagle Containerâ€™s summary judgment motion pursuant to the â€œplain meaningâ€ rule.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nB.Â  Considering the Statute as a Whole\r\nNewberry County argues the court must interpret the amending ordinance as leaving landfills as â€œspecial exceptionâ€ uses in consideration of the general purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, the inclusion of landfills as â€œspecial exceptionsâ€ in section 501, and the requirement in section 400 that the most restrictive interpretation of the ordinance will apply when ordinances appear to be at variance.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€ McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998); State v.

App. 1999).Â  â€œIn ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as a whole.â€ Mid-State Auto Auction v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996). Â â€œIn construing a statute, the court looks to the language as a whole in light of its manifest purpose.â€ Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 231, 612 S.E.2d 719, 724 (Ct. App. 2005). Â â€œA statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.â€ Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992).Â  â€œThe real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will prevail over the literal import of the words.â€ Id.Â  â€œCourts will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.â€ Id. (citing Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000); Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)).Â  â€œA court should not consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.â€ Id.Â  â€œThe language must also be read in a sense which â€˜harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.â€™â€ Municipal Assâ€™n of South Carolina v. AT&amp;T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004) (citing Hitachi Data Sys. Corp., 309 S.C. at 178, 420 S.E.2d at 846).\r\n1. General Purpose of Zoning Ordinance\r\nNewberry County contends the court cannot read the amending ordinance to allow landfills as permitted uses because such a reading goes against the general purposes of the Zoning Ordinance.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe purposes of the zoning ordinance are to implement the land use element of the comprehensive plan set forth in S.C. Code Â§ 6-29-710.â€ Section 6-29-710 of the South Carolina Code (2004) provides in part: â€œZoning ordinances must be for the general purposes of guiding development in accordance with existing and future needs and promoting public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, appearance, prosperity, and general welfare.â€Â  \r\nHowever, â€œ[i]t is not the prerogative of the courts to pass upon the wisdom of County Councilâ€™s decision.â€ Bear Enters. v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C. 137, 140, 459 S.E.2d 883, 885 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing Lenardis v. City of Greenville, 316 S.C. 471, 472, 450 S.E.2d 597, 598 (Ct. App. 1994)). â€œIf the propriety of the Councilâ€™s decision is even â€˜fairly debatable,â€™ we cannot inject our judgment into a review of their decision, but must leave that decision undisturbed.â€ Id.; see also Rushing v. City of Greenville, 265 S.C. 285, 288, 217 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1975) (â€œThe Court will not overturn the action of the City if the decision is fairly debatable because the Cityâ€™s action is presumed to have been a valid exercise of power and it is not the prerogative of the Court to pass upon the wisdom of the decision.â€). â€œRezoning is a legislative matter, and the court has no power to zone property.â€ Id.Â  â€œâ€˜[T]he governing bodies of municipalities clothed with authority to determine residential and industrial districts are better qualified by their knowledge of the situation to act upon such matters than are the courts, and they will not be interfered with unless there is a plain violation of the constitutional rights of citizens.â€™â€ Id. (citing Lenardis, 316 S.C. at 472, 450 S.E.2d at 598.Â  â€œIt is incumbent upon [the challenger] to show by clear and convincing evidence the arbitrary and capricious nature of the ordinance.â€ Bear Enterprises, 319 S.C. at 140, 459 S.E.2d at 886 (citing Town of Scranton v. Willoughby, 306 S.C. 421, 412 S.E.2d 424 (1991)).\r\nIn the present case, this Court must give effect to the Councilâ€™s intent unless we find the Councilâ€™s action was arbitrary and capricious.Â  The Council is in a better position to make zoning decisions to â€œpromote public healthâ€ and â€œprotect general welfare.â€Â  Here, Newberry County makes no argument and this court does not find that the ordinance is arbitrary and capricious.Â  Therefore, the trial court correctly found the general purposes of the Zoning Ordinance do not preclude interpreting the amending ordinance as changing landfills to permitted uses. \r\n2.Â  Consideration of Section 501 and Section 400\r\nNewberry County asserts that the court must give effect to section 501 and section 400 when interpreting the legislative intent from the amending ordinance. We disagree. \r\nThe court must interpret the amending ordinance in light of other relevant sections contained in the Zoning Ordinance.Â  â€œStatutes must be read as a whole and sections which are part of the same general statutory scheme must be construed together and given effect, if it can be done by any reasonable construction.â€ Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 622, 611 S.E.2d 297, 302 (citing Tillotson v. Keith Smith Builders, 357 S.C. 554, 593 S.E.2d 621 (Ct. App. 2004); Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d 799 (1992)). \r\nIn the instant case, section 501 lists â€œlandfillsâ€ as a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ use.Â  However, the amending ordinance directly contradicts section 501â€™s classification of landfills thereby repealing the classification and obviating the need to consider the existence of the â€œspecial useâ€ requirements.Â  Because the amending ordinance repeals section 501â€™s designation of landfills, section 501â€™s does not need to be considered. \r\nSimilarly, the amending ordinanceâ€™s direct repeal of section 501 renders section 400 obsolete.Â  Section 400 provides that when requirements in the Zoning Ordinance are at variance with the requirements of any other ordinance â€œthe most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards shall govern.â€Â  Here, the applicable restriction of section 501 is repealed by the amending ordinance leaving only one statute (section 301 as amended) to consider.Â  \r\nThe trial court did not fail to consider either section 501 or section 400 when interpreting the amending ordinance.Â Â Â  \r\nC.Â  Interpret Amending Ordinance as Clarifying\r\nNewberry County argues that the amending ordinance can and should be interpreted as merely clarifying the Zoning Ordinance to clearly indicate landfills are allowed in R-2 Rural Districts.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œA subsequent statutory amendment may be interpreted as clarifying original legislative intent.â€ Stuckey v. State Budget and Control Board, 339 S.C. 397, 401, 529 S.E.2d 706, 708 (citing Cotty v. Yartzeff, 309 S.C. 259, 422 S.E.2d 100 (1992)).Â  However, â€œ[i]t will be presumed that the Legislature in adopting an amendment to a statute intended to make some change in the existing law.â€ Vernon v. Harleyville Mut. Cas. Co., 244 S.C. 152, 155, 135 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1964) (citing 82 C.J.S. Statutes Â§ 384b(2), page 904). Â â€œThe Court must presume the legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to accomplish something.â€ Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 212, 574 S.E.2d 196, 198 (2002) (citing TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998)).\r\nWe find the amending ordinance cannot be read as merely clarifying the Zoning Ordinance.Â  In Stuckey, the legislatureâ€™s subsequent adoption of a specific time period was interpreted by the court as â€œevidence of legislative intent that â€˜directlyâ€™ be given a time-related meaning.â€ 339 S.C. at 401, 529 S.E.2d at 708.Â  In Stuckey, the subsequent legislative act added to the original act by providing a time period. Id.Â  Here, the amending ordinance cannot be interpreted as clarifying because there is nothing to clarify; prior to the amending ordinance landfills were clearly allowed in R-2 Rural Districts as special exception uses.Â  To have any effect whatsoever, the amending ordinance must be read as permitting landfills in R-2 Rural Districts without first getting approval from the Board of Zoning.Â  Newberry Countyâ€™s reading would not change the Zoning Ordinance at all, making the amending ordinanceâ€™s enactment essentially futile.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly held that the amending ordinance could not be interpreted as clarifying the Zoning Ordinance. \r\nII.Â  Repeal by Implication\r\nNewberry County claims the trial court incorrectly held that the amending ordinance repealed by implication section 501.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œ[R]epeal by implication is disfavored, and is found only when two statutes are incapable of any reasonable reconcilement.â€ Atlas Food Sys. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors, 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995) (citing Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 440 S.E.2d 357 (1994)).Â  â€œThe repeal of a statute by implication is not favored, and is to be resorted to only in the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of two statutes,â€ and â€œ[i]f the provisions of the two statutes can be construed so that both can stand, this Court will so construe them.â€Â  In the Interest of Shaw, 274 S.C. 534, 539, 265 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1980) (citing City of Spartanburg v. Blalock, 223 S.C. 252, 75 S.E.2d 361 (1953)).Â  â€œIt is well settled that repeal by implication is not favored and will not be applied if there is any way to reasonably reconcile the statutes.â€ PalmettoNet, Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 102, 108, 456 S.E.2d 385, 389 (1995).Â  â€œAs a general rule, a statute of a specific nature is not to be considered as repealed in whole or in part by a later general statute, unless there is a direct reference to the former or the intent of the legislature to repeal is explicitly implied therein.â€ Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Little, 309 S.C. 122, 125, 420 S.E.2d 499, 501 (1992) (citing City of Rock Hill v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 302 S.C. 161, 394 S.E.2d 327 (1990)).\r\nHere, we find that section 501 was not repealed by implication but rather directly repealed.Â  The intent to repeal section 501 is implied from the language of the amending ordinance.Â  While the amending ordinance did not directly reference section 501, adding â€œlandfillâ€ to the uses â€œpermittedâ€ sufficiently conveys the legislative intent to repeal the section.Â  Hence, the trial court correctly held that the amending ordinance repealed section 501.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Last Legislative Expression Rule\r\nNewberry County alleges the trial court incorrectly applied the last legislative expression rule.Â  We disagree. \r\nIf the amending ordinance is deemed ambiguous, the rules of statutory construction are employed to determine legislative intent.Â  When a statute is ambiguous, the Court considers the terms of the statute and employs the rules of statutory interpretation. Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (citing Lester v. South Carolina Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n, 334 S.C. 557, 514 S.E.2d 751 (1999)). \r\nâ€œUnder the â€˜last legislative expressionâ€™ rule, where conflicting provisions exist, the last in point of time or order of arrangement, prevails.â€ Ramsey v. County of McCormick, 306 S.C. 393, 397, 412 S.E.2d 408, 410 (1991).Â  â€œIn accordance with the principle that the last expression of the legislative will is the law, where conflicting provisions are found in the same statute, or in different statutes, the last in point of time or order of arrangement prevails.â€ Feldman v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 203 S.C. 49, 51, 26 S.E.2d 22, 24 (1943).Â  â€œ[L]ater legislation supersedes earlier laws addressing the identical issue.â€ Whiteside v. Cherokee Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993).Â  Further, â€œwhere there is one statute addressing an issue in general terms and another statute dealing with the identical issue in a more specific and definite manner, the more specific statute will be considered an exception to, or a qualifier of, the general statute and given such effect.â€ Id. (citing Wilder v. South Carolina Hwy. Depâ€™t, 228 S.C. 448, 90 S.E.2d 635 (1955)); see also Ramsey, 306 S.C. at 397, 412 S.E.2d at 410. \r\nWe find that employing the last legislative expression rule still leads to the conclusion that the Council intended the amending ordinance to change landfills to permitted uses in R-2 Rural Districts.Â  Here, the amending ordinance was not only most recently enacted but specifically added â€œlandfillâ€ to the â€œuses permittedâ€ in R-2 Rural Districts.Â  Accordingly, the amending ordinance should be given full effect. \r\nAdmittedly, â€œ[the last legislative expression rule] is purely an arbitrary rule of construction and is to be resorted to only when there is clearly an irreconcilable conflict, and all other means of interpretation have been exhausted.â€ Feldman, 203 S.C. at 54, 26 S.E.2d at 24.Â  However, â€œthe Last Legislative Expression Rule requires that in instances where it is not possible to harmonize two sections of a statute, the later legislation supersedes the earlier enactment.â€ Williams v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 311 S.C. 417, 421, 429 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1993).Â  Here, assuming the amending ordinance is ambiguous, we find it is not possible to harmonize section 301 as amended with section 501.Â  A use cannot be simultaneously categorized â€œpermittedâ€ and â€œspecial exceptionâ€.Â  The trial court properly applied the last legislative expression rule because an irreconcilable conflict would otherwise exist between these two sections. \r\nIV.Â  Consideration of Legislative History\r\nNewberry County argues the trial court erred in failing to consider the minutes of the Council as evidence of intent.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIf the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself.â€ Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 339, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (1996).Â  â€œ[L]egislative history only can be resorted to for the purpose of solving doubt, not for the purpose of creating it.â€ Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 402, 175 S.E.2d 805, 817 (1970).Â  â€œLegislative enactments are to be construed as they are written, and, unless there is an ambiguity in the legislation, resort to statements by members of a committee will not be considered in construing a particular piece of legislation.â€ Id.Â  â€œ[I]n some instances extrinsic evidence of facts or information (such as legislative history for example) may be necessary and highly probative of the rationality of the legislatureâ€™s determination.â€ State v. Byrd, 267 S.C. 87, 92, 226 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1976).Â  â€œBut in each case, the court, exercising its sound discretion, must assure itself that the evidence sought to be introduced is necessary for a fair evaluation of the legislative declaration.â€ Id.\r\nWe find that legislative history does not need to be considered in this case because the amending ordinance is not ambiguous.Â  \r\nIf the amending ordinance were ambiguous, we find the trial court did not err in determining that the Council minutes were unhelpful.Â  We have several concerns with the Council minutes.Â  First, the minutes reflect that Susan Bridges (Bridges), the then-acting Zoning Director, gave a confusing explanation of the existing Zoning Ordinance.Â  Bridges said a landfill is â€œlisted as a permitted use under the Special Exceptions,â€ and â€œlook to list of permitted uses . . . [landfill] is listed as special exception use.â€Â  However, a â€œpermitted useâ€ cannot be a â€œspecial exceptionâ€ use.Â  Second, the minutes are merely unofficial summaries of comments by a county staff person as noted by the Council secretary.Â  We assume these notes are accurate reflections of the Council meetings. See Berkely Elec. Coop. v. Mount Pleasant, 308 S.C. 205, 208, 417 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1992) (stating Council minutes that are â€œproperly authenticated or verified are the only competent evidence of the proceedings . . . .â€).Â  Still, properly authenticated minutes that communicate the events of a council meeting do not necessarily convey the intent of the legislature.Â  Here, the courtâ€™s reliance on confusing statements from the former zoning director would be ill-founded.Â  We find the minutes are not indicative of any â€œlegislativeâ€ intent behind the amending ordinance; the trial court did not err in refusing to give weight to these Council minutes.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nV.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nThe amicus curiae brief raised new issues before this Court.Â  The amicus curiae brief argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of ripeness and because the trial court improperly exercised original jurisdiction.Â  We disagree. \r\nA.Â  Appealability\r\nInitially, we must determine whether the issues raised by the amicus curiae brief are properly before this Court. \r\nGenerally, amicus curiae cannot inject new issues into a case; however, courts will consider issues presented by an amicus curiae when the court could raise the issue sua sponte. See 4 Am. Jur.2d Amicus Curiae Â§7.Â  â€œIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.â€ State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003).Â  â€œIssues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.â€ Id.Â  â€œâ€˜Lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€™â€ All Saints Parish v. Protestant Episcopal Church, 358 S.C. 209, 238, 595 S.E.2d 253, 269 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 1998); see Eaddy v. Eaddy, 283 S.C. 582, 584, 324 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1984) (â€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction ... may be raised at any stage of the proceeding.â€)).Â  â€œLack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived and should be taken notice of by this Court.â€ Amisub of South Carolina, Inc. v. Passmore, 316 S.C. 112, 114, 447 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1994). \r\nWe will address the issues raised by the amicus curiae brief because they involve questions of subject matter jurisdiction and unsettled law in South Carolina. \r\nB.Â  Ripeness\r\nAmicus curiae alleges that Eagle Containerâ€™s challenge of Newberry Countyâ€™s revocation of a land use permit is not ripe for judicial review because there has been no final determination by the Zoning Board.Â  Amicus curiae assert the court may raise the issue of ripeness sua sponte because subject matter jurisdiction considerations encompass ripeness issues.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nThe question of whether subject matter jurisdiction includes ripeness considerations is a novel issue for this state.Â  Several cases have touched on the possible relationship between the two concepts.Â  The Supreme Court of South Carolina found that â€œ[t]he existence of an actual, justiciable controversy is essential to jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment,â€ and â€œ[a] justiciable controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination . . . .â€ Orr v. Clyburn, 277 S.C. 536, 542, 290 S.E.2d 804, 807 (1982) (citing Notios Corp. v. Hanvey, 256 S.C. 275, 182 S.E.2d 55 (1971)); see also Waters v. South Carolina Land Resources Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 227, 467 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1996).Â  Similarly, this court has held â€œ[a] threshold inquiry for any court is a determination of justiciability, i.e., whether the litigation presents an active case or controversyâ€ and that â€œ[t]he concept of justiciability encompasses the doctrines of ripeness, mootness, and standing.â€ Holden v. Cribb, 349 S.C. 132, 136, 561 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, the Supreme Court of South Carolina has also found that â€œ[t]he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is generally considered a rule of â€˜policy, convenience and discretion, rather than one of law, and is not jurisdictional,â€™â€ and â€œ[t]he failure to exhaust administrative remedies goes to the prematurity of a case, not subject matter jurisdiction.â€ Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 17 n.5, 538 S.E.2d 245, 246 n.5 (2000) (citing Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201, 205, 387 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1989)). Â \r\nFederal Courts and the courts of other jurisdictions have dealt more directly with the interplay of ripeness and subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held: â€œRipeness is more than a mere procedural question; it is determinative of jurisdiction.&nbsp; If a claim is unripe, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction and the complaint must be dismissed.â€ Bigelow v. Michigan Depâ€™t of Natural Res., 970 F.2d 154, 157 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting, Southern Pac. Transp. Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 922 F.2d 498, 502 (9th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 943 (1991)).Â  Likewise, the Texas Court of Appeals recently held that â€œ[r]ipeness, like standing, is a threshold issue that implicates subject matter jurisdiction, and like standing, emphasizes the need for a concrete injury for a justiciable claim to be presented.â€ City of Weslaco v. Borne, 2005 WL 20000842 (Tex. App. 2005) (citing Patterson v. Planned Parenthood, 971 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1998)).\r\nWe find that, in line with South Carolina case law,[1] the concepts of subject matter jurisdiction and ripeness are separate and distinct.Â  â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€ Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (citations omitted).Â  In comparison, â€œ[t]he basic rationale of the doctrine of ripeness is to prevent courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by challenging parties.â€ 2 Am. Jur.2d Administrative Law Section 485 (citations omitted).Â  The concepts of subject matter jurisdiction and ripeness are often discussed simultaneously as they both involve threshold requirements; however, we find the concepts are distinguishable and should be considered separate and distinct issues. \r\nNevertheless, we find ripeness considerations may be and should be raised sua sponte.Â  Both South Carolina and Federal case law support this ruling.Â  In Baber v. Greenville County, the rule is articulated that courts generally decline to pronounce a declaration wherein the rights of a party are contingent upon the happening of some event which cannot be forecast and which may never take place. 327 S.C. 31, 44, 488 S.E.2d 314, 321 (2000) (citing Park v. Safeco Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 410, 162 S.E.2d 709 (1968)). Â The Supreme Court of the United States found â€œbecause issues of ripeness involve, at least in part, the existence of a live â€˜Case or Controversy,â€™ we cannot rely upon concessions of the parties and must determine whether the issues are ripe for decision in the â€˜Case or Controversyâ€™ senseâ€ and â€œto the extent that questions of ripeness involve the exercise of judicial restraint from unnecessary decision of constitutional issues, the Court must determine whether to exercise that restraint and cannot be bound by the wishes of the parties.â€ Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U.S. 119, 136 (1977).Â  Likewise, â€œbefore addressing merits of any appeal, [the court] must be convinced that the claim in question is ripe for review, even if neither party has raised the issue.â€ Bigelow v. Michigan Depâ€™t of Natural Res., 970 F.2d 154, 157 (6th Cir. 1992).Â  \r\nIn this case, a justiciable claim exists and there is no ripeness issue.Â  The Supreme Court of South Carolina has used a two-factor test for determining ripeness: (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision, and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration. Waters, 321 S.C. 219, 467 S.E.2d 913.Â  Here, the test is satisfied because a real, live case and controversy exists; Eagle Container will have to satisfy the requirements for â€œspecial exceptionâ€ uses if the Countyâ€™s revocation is valid.Â  Moreover, the issue before the court is a declaratory judgment action for determination of legislative intent.Â  â€œThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.â€ Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).Â  â€œAlthough great deference is accorded the decisions of those charged with interpreting and applying local zoning ordinances, â€˜a broader and more independent review is permitted when the issue concerns the construction of an ordinance.â€™â€ Id. (citing Sea Island Scenic Parkway Coalition v. Beaufort County Bd. of Adjustments &amp; Appeals, 316 S.C. 231, 235, 449 S.E.2d 254, 256 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  Thus, we find that a justiciable claim exists and this case is ripe for review. \r\nC.Â  Jurisdiction of Circuit Court\r\nAmicus curiae contends the trial court improperly exercised original jurisdiction because Eagle Container did not challenge the constitutionality or validity of either the Enabling Act or Zoning Ordinance.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn general, judicial review is appropriate only when appeal is from a final agency order.â€ Smith v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 336 S.C. 505, 528, 520 S.E.2d 339, 351 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Garris v. Governing Bd. of South Carolina Reinsurance Facility, 319 S.C. 388, 390, 461 S.E.2d 819, 821 (1995) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)).Â  â€œâ€˜A party aggrieved by the application of an ordinance must invoke and exhaust the administrative remedies provided thereby before he may resort to the courts for relief.â€™â€ De Pass v. City of Spartanburg, 234 S.C. 198, 198, 107 S.E.2d 350, 351 (1959) (citing 62 C.J.S. Municipal Corporations Â§ 206, p. 384). \r\nIn this case, Eagle Container brought a declaratory judgment action not an appeal of an agency decision.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in exercising original jurisdiction to determine the effect of the amending ordinance. \r\nD.Â  Effect of Declaratory Judgment Action\r\nAmicus curiae suggest that the trial court erred in allowing Eagle Container to use a declaratory judgment action to circumvent the ripeness requirements.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œDeclaratory judgment actions must involve an actual, justiciable controversy that is ripe for determination.â€ Waters, 321 S.C. at 228 n.7, 467 S.E.2d at 918 n.7 (citing S. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Harrison Sales Co., 285 S.C. 50, 328 S.E.2d 66 (1985)).Â  â€œDeclaratory Judgment Acts are not in general limited by their express terms to cases where there is no other adequate remedy available, but, on the contrary, are expressly made applicable, like ours, without regard to other relief claimed.â€ Southern Ry. Co. v. Order of Ry. Conductors of Am., 210 S.C. 121, 126, 41 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1947). â€œWhen there exists a genuine controversy . . . requiring a judicial determination, the court is not bound to refuse to exercise its power to declare rights and other legal relations merely because there is another remedy available.â€ Id. (citing 16 Am. Jur. Â§ 13, Page 286; Woollard v. Schaffer Stores Co., 5 N.E.2d 829 (N.Y. 1936)). \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â  The claim set forth by Eagle Container involved a justiciable controversy.Â  While Eagle Container had an alternate possibility of relief available (appeal to Board of Zoning), this alternate course required additional measures (satisfying requirement for â€œspecial usesâ€).Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in finding the case ripe for review.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude that, under the â€œplain meaning rule,â€ Ordinance No. 12-49-02 clearly and unambiguously amends the Newberry County Zoning Ordinance to change â€œlandfillsâ€ to a permitted use in R-2 Rural Districts.Â  In the alternative, if the ordinance is ambiguous, we find the rules of statutory construction, namely the last legislative expression rule, require giving effect to section 301, as amended, over section 501.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See Ward, 343 S.C. at 17 n.5, 538 S.E.2d at 246 n.5 (distinguishing â€œprematurity of a caseâ€ from subject matter jurisdiction). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4038","title":"State v.

Crocker, III, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Richland County\r\nÂ G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4038\r\nHeard September 13, 2005 â€“ Filed October 31, 2005\r\n\r\nÂ Â  AFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohn Dennis Delgado, and Kathrine Haggard Hudgins, both of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, Office of the Attorney General; and Solicitor W. Barney Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Phillip H. Crocker, III, was convicted and sentenced in Richland County for murder and trafficking in marijuana.Â  Crocker appeals only from the drug conviction and sentence, contending the State neither alleged nor presented evidence that he committed a drug trafficking offense in Richland County.Â  This contention is embraced in three assignments of error: (1) the denial of his motions to quash the marijuana trafficking indictment and for a directed verdict based on lack of jurisdiction and improper venue; (2) the denial of his motion for a directed verdict based on lack of evidence; and (3) the admission of certain evidence.[1]Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nNathaniel Casey, Jr. (known as â€œJuniorâ€) was murdered when he and his wife, Consuelo, met Crocker in a parking lot in Richland County for the purpose of buying a large amount of marijuana.Â  The relevant facts leading up to this ultimately violent meeting between the Caseys and Crocker are as follows.\r\nConsuelo operated a barbershop in Dillon, South Carolina, and Junior sold marijuana for a living.Â  The Caseys wanted to build a home, and they chose Juniorâ€™s marijuana business as the way to raise the necessary funds.Â  \r\nOn November 19, 2001, Consuelo told an acquaintance, Willie Jennings, about the plan.Â  She inquired if Jennings could assist the couple with a large purchase in the $40,000 range, or about 50 pounds of marijuana. Jennings said he could put them in touch with a dealer.Â  \r\nThe following day, November 20, Jennings returned to the barbershop with the appellant Crocker, who lived in Charlotte, North Carolina.Â  At this meeting Crocker agreed to sell Junior approximately 50 pounds of marijuana.Â  They planned to meet in Columbia, South Carolina, the following day.Â  The exact location would be determined on the way there.Â  Cell phone numbers were exchanged.Â  The meeting concluded, and it was agreed Jennings would be paid $500 for helping broker the deal between Junior and Crocker. \r\nThe next day, November 21, Consuelo and Junior left Dillon in their Chevrolet Tahoe between 1:00 and 2:00 in the afternoon and headed for Columbia with $40,000 in cash.Â  Several phone conversations were made via cell phone while en route.Â  Crocker first called the Caseys from near his home in Charlotte.Â  Crocker called the Caseys again around 3:00 p.m., this time from the Blythewood area of Columbia in Richland County.Â  Several more calls were made back and forth in the Columbia area.Â  The parties finally agreed to meet in the Loweâ€™s parking lot, near I-20 on Two Notch Road in Columbia.Â  \r\nWhen the Caseys arrived in the Loweâ€™s parking lot, Crocker pulled in behind them, driving a dark gray station wagon with wood grain paneling.Â  Crocker backed up his station wagon to the Casey vehicle.Â  Crocker got out and asked Junior to help him transfer the drugs.Â  Junior exited to help Crocker with the lifting of the marijuana, while Consuelo remained in the front seat of the vehicle.Â  \r\nCrocker and Junior transferred a large, blue, Tupperware-like container into the back of the Tahoe.Â  Consuelo noticed a conversation between Junior and Crocker as the purported drugs were placed in the Casey vehicle, but she was unable to hear what was said.Â  Crocker then pulled out a gun and shot Junior, killing him.Â  Crocker fled the scene in his station wagon.Â  Law enforcement responded to the crime scene.\r\nNo marijuana was found in the large container, only blankets and a sack of concrete and cinder blocks.Â  On the blue container police found seven fingerprints belonging to Crockerâ€™s father, Phillip H. Crocker, II.Â  Also found in the Casey vehicle were two handguns and the $40,000 in cash.Â  \r\nBoth Consuelo and Jennings eventually cooperated with police.Â  A search warrant was executed at Crockerâ€™s home in Charlotte, where he resided with his father.Â  A number of items were found at the house, including: (1) a half pound bag of marijuana in block form locked in a shed in the back yard; (2) a book on laws pertaining to marijuana; (3) storage containers identical to that found in the Caseyâ€™s vehicle, all of which contained the same type of blankets; (4) paperwork relating to a 1988 Pontiac 6000 Station Wagon, which had been sold to a third party after Juniorâ€™s murder; and (5) various weapons and ammunition.Â  Five or six cell phonesâ€”which were connected to accounts in different namesâ€”were also found.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, Crocker moved to quash the indictment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, and improper venue.Â  The trial court declined to grant the motions, noting that at the pretrial stage, the record was â€œfactually deprived.â€Â  The motions were renewed at the directed verdict stage and denied.Â  Crocker also moved to suppress the items seized from his home.Â  The trial court denied the suppression motion with respect to the marijuana and book on marijuana laws found at his residence, among other items.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Crocker of both charges.Â  Crocker was sentenced to thirty years for the murder charge and five years, consecutively, on the trafficking in marijuana charge.Â  Crocker appeals only from the drug-related conviction and sentence.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCrockerâ€™s challenge to his trafficking in marijuana conviction is threefold: (1) since the â€œState failed to allege any facts to support that the defendant committed a trafficking offense in Richland County,â€ the trial court erred in denying his motions to quash and for directed verdict, on jurisdictional and venue grounds; (2) since the â€œState failed to present evidence that the [trafficking] offense was committed in Richland County,â€ the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion based on jurisdictional and venue grounds, as well as lack of evidence; and (3) the trial court erred in the admission of certain items seized from his home.Â  We address these issues separately, although we recognize the relationship among them.\r\nI. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\r\nA. Subject matter and personal jurisdiction\r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Pierce v. State,&nbsp;338 S.C. 139, 150, 526 S.E.2d 222, 227&nbsp;(2000).Â  â€œThe circuit court has original jurisdiction in all criminal matters except those where an inferior court is given exclusive jurisdiction.â€Â  State v. Dudley,&nbsp;364 S.C. 578, 582, 614 S.E.2d 623, 625&nbsp;(2005); S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œCircuit courts obviously have subject matter jurisdiction to try criminal matters.â€ State v. Gentry,&nbsp;363 S.C. 93, 101, 610 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2005).Â  Circuit courts have subject matter jurisdiction over drug trafficking charges.Â  Dudley, 364 S.C. at 582, 614 S.E.2d at 625.Â  Generally, the requirements of subject matter jurisdiction are satisfied when appropriate charges are filed in a competent court.Â  State v. Dudley,&nbsp;354 S.C. 514, 523, 581 S.E.2d 171, 176 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d as modified,&nbsp;364 S.C. 578, 614 S.E.2d 623. \r\nâ€œJurisdiction of the offense charged and of the person of the accused is indispensable to a valid conviction.â€Â  Dudley,&nbsp;354 S.C. at 522, 581 S.E.2d at 175 (quoting State v. Langford, 223 S.C. 20, 26, 73 S.E.2d 854, 857 (1953)).Â  Two distinct types of jurisdiction exist: (1) jurisdiction of the subject or subject matter, and (2) jurisdiction of the person.Â  Dudley,&nbsp;354 S.C. at 522, 581 S.E.2d at 175.Â  \r\nWe summarily dispose of Crockerâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction claim that the State failed to allege any facts that he committed a drug trafficking offense in Richland County, and affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the above-cited authorities.Â  \r\nTurning to the second prong of Crockerâ€™s jurisdictional challenge, it is generally recognized that jurisdiction over the person in a criminal case lies in the state or county where the crime was committed.Â  4 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure Â§ 16.4(c) (2d ed. 1999).Â  The indictment alleged, in pertinent part, that Crocker â€œdid in Richland County on or about November 21, 2001[,] knowingly . . . conspire to sell . . . more than 10 lbs. of Marijuana.â€Â  During pretrial arguments, the State disputed Crockerâ€™s factual recitation, and the trial court denied the motion preliminarily, noting the record was â€œfactually deprived.â€Â  Clearly, the State alleged a trafficking offense in Richland County, and resolution of Crockerâ€™s motion required an evidentiary record.Â  We reject as meritless Crockerâ€™s assertion that the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion based on a lack of jurisdiction over his person.\r\nThe real thrust of Crockerâ€™s jurisdictional arguments is that the trial court erred in not granting his directed verdict motion, because the State failed to prove any act in furtherance of a conspiracy to traffic in marijuana took place in Richland County.Â  \r\nAs we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, as we must, we reject the premise of Crockerâ€™s assertion that the conspiracy had no connection to Richland County.Â  State v. Kelsey,&nbsp;331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69&nbsp;(1998) (holding that on a directed verdict motion in a criminal case, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State).Â  To accept Crockerâ€™s factual recitation would have required the trial courtâ€”and now usâ€”to abandon the mandated lens through which evidence is viewed in a directed verdict motion in a criminal case.Â  When properly viewed, the record is replete with evidence that many of the actions undertaken by the Caseys and Crocker in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy occurred in Richland County. \r\nWere we to indulge in the fiction that the conspiracy had no nexus to Richland County, we would nevertheless be constrained to reject Crockerâ€™s jurisdictional arguments.Â  As relates to a defendantâ€™s entitlement to a directed verdict on such grounds, our supreme court has held that â€œ[a] criminal defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present evidence that the offense was committed in the county alleged in the indictment.â€Â  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 333, 468 S.E.2d 626, 630 (1996) (quoting State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 480, 415 S.E.2d 816, 818 (1992), overruled in part by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)).Â  But the legal basis for this proposition is venue, not jurisdiction, for the court in Evans observed that â€œ[a]lthough an accused has a right to be tried in the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed, we hold this right is not jurisdictional.â€Â  Evans, 307 S.C. at 480, 415 S.E.2d at 818.Â  Evans recognized the merging of jurisdictional and venue principles in prior cases, but â€œoverruledâ€ those cases â€œ[t]o the extent . . . the cases . . . indicate[d] that venue is jurisdictional . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  The right to be tried in the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed, then, is a matter of venue.Â  \r\nB. Venue\r\nBecause the trial court had jurisdiction over Crockerâ€”subject matter and personalâ€”the issue is whether venue was properly laid in Richland County.Â  As noted, venue principles entitle a criminal defendant â€œto a directed verdict when the State fails to present evidence that the offense was committed in the county alleged in the indictment.â€Â  State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 480, 415 S.E.2d 816, 818 (1992), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  The standard for establishing venue is not a stringent one, for â€œvenue, like jurisdiction, in a criminal case need not be affirmatively proved, and circumstantial evidence of venue, though slight, is sufficient . . . .â€Â  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 334, 468 S.E.2d 626, 630 (1996).Â  â€œ[W]here some acts material to the offense . . . occur in one county, and some in another, venue is proper in either county.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nCrocker was charged with trafficking in marijuana in violation of section 44-53-370(e)(1)(a)(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2000).Â  One manner in which the State may establish the substantive offense of trafficking in marijuana under this section is to prove that the defendant â€œconspire[d] to sellâ€ ten or more pounds of marijuana.Â  Section 44-53-370(e)(1).Â  Thus, a defendant may be charged with trafficking under a theory of conspiracy.Â  \r\nA conspiracy is defined as the â€œcombination between two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or lawful object by unlawful means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003).Â  â€œThe gravamen of conspiracy is an agreement or combination.â€Â  State v. Dudley,&nbsp;354 S.C. 514, 532, 581 S.E.2d 171, 181 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d as modified,&nbsp;364 S.C. 578, 614 S.E.2d 623 (2005).Â  An overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is not necessary to prove the crime.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nâ€œTo establish the existence of a conspiracy, proof of an express agreement is not necessary, and direct evidence is not essential, but the conspiracy may be sufficiently shown by circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the parties.â€Â  Id. (quoting State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001)).Â  Evidence of direct contact or an explicit agreement between the defendants need not be shown.Â  State v. Barroso, 320 S.C. 1, 8, 462 S.E.2d 862, 868&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995), revâ€™d on other grounds, 328 S.C. 268, 493 S.E.2d 854 (1997).Â  â€œIt is sufficient to show that each defendant knew or had reason to know of the scope of the conspiracy and that each defendant had reason to believe his own benefits were dependent upon the success of the entire venture.â€Â  Id. at 8-9, 462 S.E.2d at 868.Â  \r\nThe State presented evidence that the agreement between Crocker and the Caseys was formed in Dillon County.Â  Crocker argues that because he challenges the existence of the agreement itself, acts in furtherance of the purported conspiracy should not be considered in laying venue.Â  Crocker misapprehends the interplay between the law of conspiracy and venue.Â  â€œVenue of a prosecution for conspiracy may be laid in either the county in which the agreement was entered, or in any county in which an overt act was done by any of the conspirators in furtherance of their common design.â€Â  State v. Wells, 249 S.C. 249, 259, 153 S.E.2d 904, 909 (1967); see also State v. Hightower, 221 S.C. 91, 97-98, 69 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1952) (noting that â€œ[t]he rule is generally recognized that if the overt act is committed within the courtâ€™s jurisdiction, the place of the conspiracy is immaterialâ€).Â  The jury, of course, could not have returned a guilty verdict on the conspiracy indictment without finding the formation of the marijuana trafficking agreement in Dillon County on November 20. \r\nThe November 21 meeting in Richland County occurred as a result of the agreementâ€”to traffic in marijuanaâ€”made the previous day in Dillon County.Â  Moreover, because numerous phone calls were made in Richland County between Crocker and Junior to determine the location for the transfer of the marijuana, and the meeting occurred in Richland County, ample evidence exists to clear the hurdle necessary to support venue in Richland County.Â  See Williams, 321 S.C. at 333-34, 468 S.E.2d at 630 (holding that venue need not be affirmatively proved).Â  Venue was proper in Richland County.Â  \r\nII. Conspiracy to Traffic in Marijuana\r\nCrocker next claims that he was entitled to a directed verdict because the State failed to prove the existence of a conspiracy to traffic in marijuana. Crocker testified that he had no knowledge of and no involvement in the alleged agreement to traffic marijuana.Â  Specifically, Crocker argues that because no marijuana was actually delivered to the Caseys in Richland County, the only inference supported by the evidence is that the perpetratorâ€™s intent was to rob the Caseys, not sell them marijuana.Â  Therefore, he asserts no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ existed to form the agreement necessary for a conspiracy charge.Â  Of Crockerâ€™s various assignments of error, this one is the most fundamentally at odds with our standard of review from the denial of a directed verdict motion, and we reject it.Â  \r\nCrocker asserts that no meeting of the minds can be shown because the perpetrator only pretended to set up a drug sale, but intended from the beginning to rob the Caseys.Â  There are, to be sure, situations where a lack of an agreement is manifest and the absence of a conspiracy may be determined as a matter of law. Â For example, â€œone cannot enter into a conspiracy with another who only feigns acquiescence in a crime; such as an informer or undercover agent.â€Â  State v. Holmes,&nbsp;277 S.C. 232, 233, 285 S.E.2d 353, 354&nbsp;(1981).Â  Crocker was neither an informer nor an undercover agent. \r\nWe additionally note that the law calls for an objective, rather than subjective, test in determining the existence of a conspiracy.Â  There are sound policy reasons for using an objective standard.Â  The drug culture is not known for attracting paragons of virtue, as courts are often presented with â€œdrug deals gone bad,â€ and in any event, a subjective test favorable to a defendant would run counter to the well-established standard of review for directed verdict motions.Â  State v. Kelsey,&nbsp;331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998) (holding that on a directed verdict motion in a criminal case, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State).Â  For purposes of the trial courtâ€™s resolution of the directed verdict motion, the evidence, when viewed objectively in the proper light, created a jury question as to the existence of the claimed drug conspiracy.[2]\r\nWe find direct evidence of the conspiracy in the testimony of Consuelo and Jennings.Â  They understood that the agreement was for the Caseys to buy marijuana from Crocker, with Jennings to receive $500 for brokering the deal.Â  We find circumstantial evidence in the cell phone calls in Richland County and the Caseys traveling to Richland County with $40,000.Â  We find further circumstantial evidence in the items seized from Crockerâ€™s home.Â  Because some evidence indicated the agreement was to traffic in marijuana, the question of the existence and nature of the agreement was properly a jury question.\r\nWe finally note that Crocker never testified that he planned to rob the Caseys at trial, but instead denied any connection with the transaction.Â  Although the evidence indicates that at some point Crocker decided to withdraw from the marijuana conspiracy and to double-cross the Caseys, the crime of conspiracy was complete at the time the agreement was made.Â  See State v. Woods, 189 S.C. 281, 287-88, 1 S.E.2d 190, 193-94&nbsp;(1939) (stating that a conspirator seeking to withdraw must affirmatively communicate this intention to his associates); see also State v. Gunn,&nbsp;313 S.C. 124, 135, 437 S.E.2d 75, 81&nbsp;(1993) (holding that certain defendants withdrew by communicating their intent to do so to all co-conspirators).Â  The record here is devoid of any suggestion that the perpetrator communicated an intent to withdraw from the conspiracy to Jennings or the Caseys.Â  The presence of evidence establishing the existence of the drug conspiracy, coupled with the absence of evidence of withdrawal from the conspiracy, confirms the correctness of the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny the directed verdict motion.Â  \r\nIII. Motion to Suppress\r\nCrockerâ€™s final argument is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana brick and book on marijuana laws found at his residence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441&nbsp;(1996).Â  To warrant reversal, an appellant must show both error and resulting prejudice.Â  Recco Tape &amp; Label Co., Inc. v. Barfield,&nbsp;312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840&nbsp;(1994).Â  â€œ[E]vidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.â€Â  State v. Staten,&nbsp;364 S.C. 7, 36-37, 610 S.E.2d 823, 838&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005); Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.â€ State v. Shuler,&nbsp;353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp;(2003); Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nHere, the marijuana and the book on marijuana laws were relevant to establish the nature of the conspiracy.Â  As discussed above, the marijuana was in brick form, indicating intended use in volume sale, not personal consumption.Â  The book on marijuana laws also had some probative value as to the trafficking charge.Â  We cannot say the danger of unfair prejudice from the evidence substantially outweighed its probative value.Â  We thus find no abuse of discretion in the admission of this evidence.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reject Crockerâ€™s various challenges to the marijuana trafficking conviction and sentence. We hold that all of Crockerâ€™s motions attacking jurisdiction and venue were properly denied.Â  We further hold that sufficient evidence existed that Crocker entered into a conspiracy to sell marijuana to survive his motion for a directed verdict on the trafficking charge.Â  Finally, the trial court acted within its discretion in the admission of the challenged evidence.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n HEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  In challenging the admission of evidence seized from his Charlotte, North Carolina home, the last sentence of Crockerâ€™s brief reads: â€œThe appellantâ€™s conviction for trafficking in marijuana should be vacated and the conviction for murder should be reversed.â€Â  This is the only challenge to the murder conviction.Â  Crockerâ€™s â€œStatement of Issues on Appealâ€ contains no reference or challenge to the murder conviction. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€).Â  Moreover, conclusory statements unaccompanied by argument and citation to authority are insufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review.Â  Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that failure to provide argument or supporting authority for an issue renders it abandoned); Jean Hoefer Toal et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina 75-76 (2d. ed. 2002).\r\n[2]  Crockerâ€™s view that the purported drug deal was never intendedâ€”and the perpetrator secretly planned all along to rob the Caseysâ€”is interesting in light of his testimony that he had no involvement in these crimes and was not present in Dillon on November 20, 2001.Â  We decline to accept Crockerâ€™s self-serving version of the perpetratorâ€™s undisclosed secret intentions, especially when on appeal from the denial of a directed verdict we are required to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the State.Â  If Crockerâ€™s argument were adopted as framed, we would be creating a complete defense to a conspiracy charge that would entitle a defendant to a directed verdict on the mere self-serving contention that he (or the perpetrator) never intended to complete the drug transaction.Â  A defendant like Crocker may advance such an argument, and a jury may accept the argument that there was no agreement in the first instance and acquit on the conspiracy charge.Â  But Crocker asks us to rule in his favor on this issue as a matter of law.Â  The presence of evidence in support of the indicted conspiracy offense precludes the direction of a verdict.Â  And the law is contrary to Crockerâ€™s position, for a conspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence and conductâ€”objectively viewedâ€”of the parties.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001).Â  These are factual matters for a jury, not the court, to settle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
