Scott Kunst appeals the circuit court's grant of summary\r\njudgment on his defamation cause of action against David Loree. On appeal,\r\nKunst argues the circuit court improperly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel\r\nwhen dismissing his defamation claim. We reverse and remand.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis case arises out of the construction of a lake home on Lake Keowee in Pickens\r\nCounty, South Carolina. Richard and Barbara Gaby (\"the Gabys\") hired\r\nKunstwerke Corporation (\"Kunstwerke\") to construct a residence in the Reserve on\r\nLake Keowee. Kunst is the sole owner of Kunstwerke.\r\n\r\nIn early 2006, disputes arose when the Gabys began to suspect Kunst was not\r\npaying subcontractors for completed work on their lake home. The Gabys\r\ninstructed an employee, David Loree, to investigate their suspicions. Loree\r\ncontacted a number of subcontractors and vendors who worked on the Gabys' lake\r\nhome and questioned them about whether they had been paid. From this\r\ninvestigation, Loree concluded that, although the Gabys made timely payments to\r\nKunst, Kunst failed to make the proper payments to the subcontractors and\r\nvendors. Loree also concluded that Kunst overcharged the Gabys for work\r\nprovided by certain subcontractors.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 2006, the Gabys brought suit (the \"Gaby Action\") against Kunstwerke\r\nand Kunst, individually, alleging breach of contract, breach of contract\r\naccompanied by a fraudulent act, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and\r\nviolation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. The defendants failed\r\nto timely answer the Gabys' complaint, and the Gabys filed a motion for entry of\r\ndefault. On June 20, 2006, the circuit court issued an order of default. Thereafter,\r\nKunst and Kunstwerke filed a motion for relief from default, claiming their failure\r\nto respond was excusable and that meritorious defenses existed. On December 7,\r\n2006, the circuit court heard arguments on this motion and denied relief from the\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing to determine damages in the\r\nGaby Action. The Gabys presented testimony from four witnesses at this damages\r\nhearing, including testimony from Loree. Kunstwerke's counsel and Kunst, who\r\nproceeded pro se, were allowed to extensively cross-examine each of these\r\nwitnesses. On May 16, 2007, the circuit court entered an order finding the Gabys\r\nhad \"presented sufficient evidence to establish their claims fully.\" The order states\r\nthe circuit court \"start[ed] with the premise that all facts relating to the pertinent\r\ncauses of action [were] admitted.\" The circuit court awarded the Gabys\r\n\n$353,993.91 in actual damages, $70,798 in punitive damages, and $35,807.41 in\r\nattorney's fees and costs.1\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 2006, shortly after the motion for relief from default was denied,\r\nKunst brought the current action against the Gabys and Loree, alleging defamation,\r\ntortious interference, and intention infliction of emotional distress. In his\r\ncomplaint, Kunst alleged the Gabys and Loree damaged his reputation and the\r\nreputation of Kunstwerke during their investigation leading up to the Gaby Action.\r\n\r\nOn April 14, 2007, the circuit court issued an order dismissing Kunst's causes of\r\naction against the Gabys on the basis that these causes of action were compulsory\r\ncounterclaims under Rule 13(a), SCRCP, that should have been brought in the\r\nGaby Action and were therefore barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.2\r\nAs a result of this April 2007 order, the only causes of action remaining were those\r\nagainst Loree. On March 9, 2009, the circuit court issued an order granting Loree\r\nsummary judgment on Kunst's tortious interference and intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress claims. Kunst's defamation claim against Loree was the sole\r\nremaining cause of action.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, 2010, the circuit court issued an order dismissing Kunst's\r\ndefamation claim against Loree. In dismissing this cause of action, the circuit\r\ncourt reasoned that truth is an absolute defense to defamation and \"[t]he issue of\r\nthe truth of the statements allegedly made by Loree was necessary to support the\r\nprior judgment and damages in the [Gaby Action].\" Accordingly, the circuit court\r\nfound the veracity of Loree's statements had been \"actually litigated\" during the\r\nGaby Action and, therefore, the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred Kunst from\r\nrelitigating this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Following this order, Kunst appealed the circuit court's denial of his motion for\r\nrelief from default and the award of damages to this court. This court affirmed the\r\ncircuit court's denial of Kunst's motion for relief from default and award of actual\r\nand punitive damages. See Gaby v. Kunstwerke Corp., Op. No. 2009-UP-028\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 9, 2009). Kunst then sought a writ of certiorari from our\r\nsupreme court, which was denied on June 10, 2010.\r\n2   Kunst does not appeal this order in the instant appeal.\r\n\nOn November 12, 2010, Kunst filed a lengthy motion \"to reconsider or amend,\"\r\narguing, in part, that the circuit court deviated from South Carolina case law in\r\napplying collateral estoppel to a default judgment. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same\r\nstandard applied by the [circuit] court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Bovain v. Canal\r\nIns., 383 S.C. 100, 105, 678 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2009). Rule 56(c) provides a circuit\r\ncourt may grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. (quoting Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP). \"In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and\r\nall inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in\r\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt.\r\nCo., 381 S.C. 326, 329-30, 673 S.E.2d 801, 802 (2009). To withstand a motion for\r\nsummary judgment \"in cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of\r\nproof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of\r\nevidence.\" Id. at 330, 673 S.E.2d at 803.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nKunst argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment by applying the\r\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel based upon the default judgment rendered against\r\nhim in the Gaby Action. We agree.\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina law, \"[c]ollateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion,\r\nprevents a party from relitigating an issue that was decided in a previous action,\r\nregardless of whether the claims in the first and subsequent lawsuits are the same.\"\r\nCarolina Renewal, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 550, 554, 684 S.E.2d\r\n779, 782 (Ct. App. 2009). \"The party asserting collateral estoppel must\r\ndemonstrate that the issue in the present lawsuit was: (1) actually litigated in the\r\nprior action; (2) directly determined in the prior action; and (3) necessary to\r\nsupport the prior judgment.\" Id. \"While the traditional use of collateral estoppel\r\nrequired mutuality of parties to bar relitigation, modern courts recognize the\r\nmutuality requirement is not necessary for the application of collateral estoppel\r\nwhere the party against whom estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to\r\n\npreviously litigate the issues.\" Snavely v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 379 S.C. 386, 398,\r\n665 S.E.2d 222, 228 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Bacote, our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n      We have previously adopted the general rule of collateral estoppel as\r\n      set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27 (1982) in\r\n      South Carolina Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Wal-Mart Stores,\r\n      Inc., 304 S.C. 210, 403 S.E.2d 625 (1991). Section 27 states: \"When\r\n      an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid\r\n      and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment,\r\n      the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the\r\n      parties, whether on the same or different claim.\" See also Palm v.\r\n      General Painting Co., Inc., 302 S.C. 372, 396 S.E.2d 361 (1990)\r\n      (citations omitted) (\"Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, . . . the\r\n      second action is based upon a different claim and the judgment in the\r\n      first action precludes relitigation of only those issues 'actually and\r\n      necessarily litigated in the first suit.'\").\r\n\r\n      In the context of a default judgment, collateral estoppel or issue\r\n      preclusion does not apply because an essential element of that\r\n      doctrine requires that the claim sought to be precluded actually have\r\n      been litigated in the earlier litigation. 50 C.J.S. Judgments § 797\r\n      (1997).\r\n\r\n331 S.C. 328, 330-31, 503 S.E.2d 161, 162-63 (1998).\r\n\r\nIn Bacote, a defendant charged with driving under the influence moved to suppress\r\nevidence regarding his refusal to take a breath test. Id. at 329, 503 S.E.2d at 162.\r\nPrior to his trial, an administrative hearing was held to determine whether the\r\ndefendant's license would be automatically suspended under section 56-5-2950 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code. Id. The arresting officer failed to appear at this hearing\r\nand, as a result, the hearing officer rescinded the defendant's suspension. Id. At\r\ntrial, the circuit court granted the defendant's motion to suppress, finding the State\r\nwas collaterally estopped from introducing evidence of his refusal to take a breath\r\ntest based upon the rescission of his license suspension at the administrative\r\nhearing. Id. The State appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. Id. The\r\nsupreme court agreed and held that an administrative license revocation proceeding\r\n\ndoes not preclude litigation of the same issues in ensuing criminal prosecution. Id.\r\nat 331, 503 S.E.2d at 163.\r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the supreme court first found that \"[i]n the context of a\r\ndefault judgment, collateral estoppel or issue preclusion does not apply because an\r\nessential element of that doctrine requires that the claim sought to be precluded\r\nactually have been litigated in the earlier litigation.\" Id. The supreme court went\r\non to state, \"Even had the issue actually been litigated, we hold collateral estoppel\r\ndoes not apply to issues decided at administrative hearings held pursuant to § 56-5-\r\n2950.\" Id. In support of this alternative ground, the court relied upon two\r\nexceptions to the general rule regarding issue preclusion. Id. at 331-32, 503 S.E.2d\r\nat 163 (relying upon the fairness and public policy exceptions found in section 28\r\nof the Restatement (Second) of Judgments).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the circuit court found Bacote was distinguishable from the\r\nfacts of the current case and, thus, did not apply. The circuit court also found that\r\nlanguage in Bacote regarding the application of default judgments to the doctrine\r\nof collateral estoppel was dicta and thus not controlling. Following out-of-state\r\nprecedent, the circuit court determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel could\r\nbe applied \"in default cases as to matters essential to the [prior] judgment.\" We\r\ndisagree and hold South Carolina jurisprudence overwhelmingly supports the\r\nposition that the doctrine of collateral estoppel cannot be applied to default\r\njudgments to preclude subsequent litigation.\r\n\r\nFirst, we find the circuit court erred in interpreting Bacote in its order granting\r\nsummary judgment. The circuit court found the language in Bacote addressing the\r\napplication of collateral estoppel to default judgments was dicta, as opposed to\r\ncontrolling precedent. We disagree and read Bacote as offering two separate but\r\nequally viable grounds. See Bacote, 331 S.C. at 331, 503 S.E.2d at 163 (\"Even had\r\nthe issue actually been litigated, we hold collateral estoppel does not apply [to the\r\ncurrent action].\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nBoth federal courts and other state courts have interpreted Bacote as establishing\r\nthe rule that default judgments cannot be used to preclude subsequent litigation\r\nunder the doctrine of collateral estoppel. See In re Springhart, 450 B.R. 725, 727\r\n(Bankr. S.D. Ohio 2011) (\"After reviewing the doctrine of collateral estoppel or\r\nissue preclusion, as adopted in South Carolina, the court concludes that the default\r\njudgment and order awarding damages cannot be afforded preclusive effect . . . .\r\nFirst, South Carolina does not allow default judgments to have preclusive effect\r\n\nunder the collateral estoppel doctrine because no issues were actually litigated.\");\r\nPowell v. Lane, 289 S.W.3d 440, 451 (Ark. 2008) (Wills, J., dissenting) (citing\r\nBacote as an example of state law which \"adhere[s] to the general rule\" that default\r\njudgments cannot be used under the doctrine of collateral estoppel).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, South Carolina jurisprudence regarding collateral estoppel strongly\r\nsupports the position in Bacote. South Carolina courts have consistently followed\r\nthe Restatement (Second) of Judgments with regard to the issue of collateral\r\nestoppel. See, e.g., S.C. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\r\n304 S.C. 210, 213, 403 S.E.2d 625, 627 (1991) (adopting the general rule set forth\r\nin the Restatement for offensive use of collateral estoppel); Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C.\r\n363, 370, 315 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"[A] fair rule regarding the\r\napplication of issue preclusion in subsequent litigation with different parties is the\r\nrule recently formulated by the American Law Institute [in the Restatement\r\n(Second) of Judgments].\"). The Restatement takes the position that default\r\njudgments have not been \"actually litigated,\" and therefore cannot be used as the\r\nbasis for collateral estoppel in subsequent actions. See Restatement (Second) of\r\nJudgments § 27 cmt. e (1982) (\"In the case of a judgment entered by . . . default,\r\nnone of the issues is actually litigated. Therefore, the rule of this Section does not\r\napply with respect to any issue in a subsequent action.\"). Some courts have\r\napplied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in default cases as to matters that are\r\nessential to the judgment. See, e.g., In re Byard, 47 B.R. 700, 706 (Bankr. M.D.\r\nTenn. 1985) (finding that, under Kansas law, a default judgment would preclude\r\nrelitigation of issues \"determined and necessary\" to that judgment). However, the\r\nRestatement's position is the view taken by the majority of the courts throughout\r\nour nation. See Powell, 289 S.W.3d at 450 (Wills, J., dissenting) (stating that the\r\n\"majority view\" is that default judgments cannot serve as the basis for collateral\r\nestoppel); 50 C.J.S. Judgments § 1049 (2013) (\"Although a party against whom a\r\ndefault judgment is entered certainly had an opportunity to litigate, most courts\r\nhave concluded that an opportunity to litigate should not be given the same effect\r\nas actual litigation . . . .\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nSecond, we find the circuit court erred in holding that Bacote and the current case\r\nwere factually distinguishable. The circuit court found that, unlike Bacote in\r\nwhich the State did not participate in the administrative hearing resulting in\r\ndefault, Kunst actively took part in the damages hearing in the Gaby Action. The\r\ncircuit court determined this participation in the damages hearing afforded him a\r\n\"full and fair opportunity to be heard.\" We disagree.\r\n\nSome courts adhering to the general rule that default judgments cannot be used to\r\nestablish collateral estoppel have recognized an exception when a party extensively\r\nparticipated in litigation. See, e.g., In re Ragucci, 433 B.R. 889, 985 (Bankr. M.D.\r\nFla. 2010) (\"[When] a party has substantially participated in an action in which he\r\nhad a full and fair opportunity to defend on the merits, but subsequently [chose]\r\nnot to do so, it is not an abuse of discretion to apply the doctrine of collateral\r\nestoppel to prevent further litigation of the issues resolved by the default judgment\r\nin the prior action.\" (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)); Insituform\r\nTechs., Inc. v. AMerik Supplies, Inc., 850 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1362 (N.D. Ga. 2012)\r\n(finding when a defendant has substantially participated in a lawsuit and \"is\r\ndefaulted as a sanction for dilatory or obstructive conduct,\" the \"actually litigated\"\r\nrequirement is met, and it is within the court's discretion to apply collateral\r\nestoppel). However, this exception has not been recognized under South Carolina\r\ncase law.\r\n\r\nFurther, we find this exception would not apply to the facts of this case. Although\r\nKunst participated in the damages hearing by cross-examining witnesses called by\r\nthe Gabys, it appears he was not afforded the opportunity to testify or to call\r\nwitnesses to testify on his behalf. Kunst was also not allowed to participate in any\r\ndiscovery on this matter. In addition, because Kunst was in default, the circuit\r\ncourt \"start[ed] with the premise that all facts relating to the pertinent causes of\r\naction [were] admitted.\" Accordingly, we hold Kunst was not presented with a fair\r\nopportunity to \"actually litigate\" the veracity of Loree's alleged statements to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold the doctrine of collateral estoppel cannot be applied to\r\ndefault judgments because the essential element requiring the claim sought to be\r\nprecluded actually have been litigated in the earlier action is not met. Therefore,\r\nwe find the circuit court erred in ruling Kunst's defamation claim was precluded\r\nunder the doctrine of collateral estoppel based upon the default judgment rendered\r\nin the Gaby Action.3 Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's grant of summary\r\njudgment on Kunst's defamation claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Kunst raises several additional arguments on appeal. However, because we find\r\nhis first issue dispositive of this appeal, we decline to address his remaining issues.\r\nSee Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\nS.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining\r\nissues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order granting summary judgment is\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5164","title":"State v.

Appellant argues the trial court improperly admitted\r\nevidence of prior abuse allegations (bad act evidence) against Appellant to show\r\nthe existence of a common scheme or plan. Specifically, Appellant argues the\r\nproffered testimony was: (1) not sufficiently similar to the crimes charged; and (2)\r\n\ntoo remote and, thus, the probative value was substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice. We disagree and affirm.\r\n\r\n                       FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis case involved four victims (Victims), as well as two witnesses (404(b) \n\r\nWitnesses1) who testified to prior bad acts of Appellant. The trial court, finding \n\r\neach 404(b) Witness's testimony was sufficiently similar to the crimes charged and \n\r\nthat the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by the \n\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice, admitted the evidence to prove the existence of a \n\r\ncommon scheme or plan. Because Appellant now challenges the admission of the \n\r\n404(b) Witnesses' testimony, as their testimony related to the alleged abuse of each\n\r\nof the four victims, a somewhat extended factual review is essential to a fair \n\r\nappraisal of Appellant's challenge. \n\r\n\r\nThree sisters (then-nineteen-year-old Victim 1, seventeen-year-old Victim 2, and \n\r\nsixteen-year-old Victim 3) participated in a youth dance team at a church in \n\r\nGreenville, South Carolina. At the team's weekly meetings, the group's members \n\r\ndanced, listened to worship music, and prayed. The center's art director also \n\r\nregularly talked to the dancers about issues pertinent to adolescent social \n\r\ndevelopment. At the November 24, 2008 meeting, the art director spoke about \n\r\nappropriate social media usage; this discourse prompted a male dancer to share \n\r\nwith the team that he was a victim of sexual abuse. \n\r\n\r\nAlthough the boy's disclosure did not pertain to Appellant in any way, Victim 1, \n\r\nVictim 2, and Victim 3 reacted to the boy's disclosure with \"an explosion of tears, \n\r\nsobbing, [and] wheezing.\" It was then \"very obvious [to the art director] that \n\r\nsomething else was going on, and that it needed to be addressed immediately.\" \n\r\nThe art director privately encouraged the sisters to talk to someone they trusted. \n\r\n\r\nAs the three sisters drove home,2 they discussed the necessity of coming forward \n\r\nabout previously experiencing their biological father's (Appellant's) sexually-\n\r\nabusive conduct, in view of the fact that their eight-year-old half-sister (Victim 4) \n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Rule 404(b), SCRE.\n\r\n2Victim 1, Victim 2, and Victim 3 did not live with Appellant when Appellant \n\r\nallegedly abused them. These three Victims lived with their mother, Beverlyn, \n\r\nwho had previously divorced Appellant; however, they often spent weekends with \n\r\nAppellant at his residence. \n\r\n\nwas living with Appellant.3 Shortly thereafter, Victim 1 contacted the art director\r\nand disclosed to her the long-term sexual abuse the sisters experienced. The art\r\ndirector alerted the church's risk management department, which contacted the\r\ncounty's sheriff and department of social services. The ensuing investigations\r\nresulted in the State's indictment of Appellant for three counts of lewd act upon a\r\nminor (Victims 1, 3, and 4), one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct\r\nwith a minor (Victim 2), and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct\r\nwith a minor (Victims 2 and 4).\r\n\r\nAt the trial's outset, the State moved to admit the testimony of the two 404(b)\r\nWitnesses. These witnesses claimed that Appellant sexually abused them in 1987,\r\nwhen the witnesses were approximately eight years old. Thus, the alleged prior\r\nbad acts occurred approximately eleven years before Appellant allegedly first\r\nabused then-eight-year-old Victim 1.4\r\n\r\nThe State argued this testimony: (1) was relevant; (2) demonstrated that Appellant\r\nabused the witnesses in \"ways that are strikingly similar to the [crimes charged],\"\r\nand that such similarities outweighed the dissimilarities; and (3) the probative\r\nvalue was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\r\nAppellant objected, primarily referencing the temporal remoteness of the prior\r\nallegations of abuse to the charged crimes.5\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the State's related brief, the trial judge stated he would allow the\r\n404(b) Witnesses to testify, but only after the Victims testified, thus allowing\r\nanother opportunity to ensure the bad act testimony would demonstrate substantial\r\n\r\n3 While Victim 4 was Appellant's biological child, she did not share a biological\r\nmother with Victims 1, 2, and 3. When Victim 4's mother was incarcerated in\r\n2002, Victim 4 moved in with Appellant and Appellant's then-girlfriend. Although\r\nthe mother of Victim 4 reacquired physical custody in 2004, after completing her\r\nprison sentence, Victim 4 subsequently returned to Appellant's home.\r\n4 Each 404(b) Witness alleged that Appellant abused her in 1987. Thus, an eleven\r\nto twenty year time period exists between the bad acts (1987) and the charged\r\ncrimes (1998-2007/2008). While there were no allegations of any abuse occurring\r\nin the decade following the 404(b) Witnesses' 1988 disclosure, the alleged\r\nresumption of sexual abuse directly correlates with Appellant's oldest daughter\r\nreaching the age of eight (the same age as the 404(b) Witnesses when Appellant\r\nallegedly abused them).\r\n5 Each Victim's allegations related to conduct occurring as follows: Victim 1,\r\n1998-2002; Victim 2, 1999-2004; Victim 3, 2006; and Victim 4, 2004-2007.\r\n\nsimilarity to the Victims' given testimony. The trial judge then found the\r\ntestimony would be relevant and proceeded to address the evidence's similarity to\r\nthe charged crimes, citing the Solicitor's argument that \"some nine different\r\nelements\" of similarity existed:\r\n\r\n             From what's been set forth as proposed testimony, I think\r\n             there's a great similarity between the instances to show\r\n             that there would be a common scheme or plan . . . , I\r\n             think by a clear and convincing standard . . . there is\r\n             sufficient proof . . . . I think that the similarity is,\r\n             certainly, close enough there as far as the absence of\r\n             other Defendants, the location, the ages, the\r\n             developmental stages of the victims throughout each of\r\n             these alleged incidents . . . [and] that [Appellant] would\r\n             be in a position of authority . . . . I think the probative\r\n             value is stronger and the evidence should be allowed to\r\n             show . . . a common scheme . . . .\r\n\r\nThe trial judge agreed to reexamine this pre-trial ruling immediately prior to the\r\n404(b) Witnesses offering their testimony.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the trial commenced and all four Victims testified about the nature and\r\ncircumstances of the sexual abuse they collectively endured.6 Victim 1, who was\r\ntwenty-one years old at the time of trial, testified that Appellant: sexually abused\r\nher every time she spent the night with him, while under his supervision at his\r\napartment or at Appellant's sister's (her aunt's) home; began abusing her when she\r\nwas around eight years old; inappropriately touched the Victims every time they\r\nspent the night with him; insisted upon bathing all of the Victims, despite the fact\r\nthat each one was capable of bathing herself; consistently rubbed lotion on each\r\nVictim after bathing them, concentrating on each one's buttocks and genital areas;\r\nput each Victim to bed one at a time, whereby Appellant would lay on each\r\nVictim's bed, place that child on top of him, and would then bounce that child up\r\nand down with his hips;7 played hide and seek with all of the Victims, whereby the\r\nchildren would hide and upon Appellant finding specifically, Victim 2, he would\r\n\r\n\r\n6 The testimony of Victims 1, 2, and 3 was not limited to abuse that each child \n\r\npersonally experienced; each of these Victims also testified about how Appellant \n\r\nabused her sister(s).\n\r\n7 The Victims consistently referred to this conduct as \"hunching.\" \n\r\n\nplace his face on her genitals while the other Victims remained hidden;8 and\r\nlaughed when a child would see him inappropriately touching another child.\r\n\r\nVictim 2, who was nineteen years old at the time of trial, also testified about the\r\nnature and circumstances of the alleged abuse. She testified that Appellant:\r\nsexually abused her every time she spent the night with him, while under his\r\nsupervision at his apartment or at Appellant's sister's house; began sexually\r\nabusing her when she was around nine years old; would tell her how to get in the\r\ntub and begin washing her, despite Victim 2 asserting, \"No, I can wash myself;\"\r\n\"would start rubbing lotion on [her genitals and buttocks];\" would watch the\r\nchildren shower;9 removed her clothing while she was sleeping; placed his hands\r\ninside her pants while she watched television and would rub her skin; and stopped\r\nabusing her when she was around fifteen years old.\r\n\r\nVictim 3 was sixteen years old at the time of the trial and testified that Appellant:\r\nsexually abused her frequently while she was under his supervision at his\r\napartment or at Appellant's sister's house; began sexually abusing her when she\r\nwas around eight years old; would wash her, even though Victim 3 \"knew [she]\r\ncould do it by [her]self\" and would tell Appellant she didn't need his help; \"would\r\nrub [lotion] all over [their] bodies;\" would rub his fingers inside and outside of her\r\nunderwear; would play hide and seek with the Victims, whereby all Victims would\r\nhide and, upon Appellant finding specifically, Victim 2, Appellant would place his\r\nface on the genitals of Victim 2 while the other children remained hidden; would\r\nplace a Victim on his hips, and \"make [her] go up and down;\" made her touch his\r\ngenitals and would \"laugh\" when she resisted; would \"laugh\" after an incident of\r\nabuse; stopped abusing her when she was around fourteen years-old.\r\n\r\nVictim 4, who was ten years old at the time of trial, testified that Appellant:\r\nsexually abused her at his apartment; inappropriately touched her prior to bedtime;\r\nand would often inappropriately touch her while she watched television.\r\n\r\n\r\n8 Victim 1 testified that in one instance of the \"game,\" Appellant placed his face on\r\nthe genitals of Victim 2, while the other Victims remained hidden. Victim 3 also\r\ntestified that this incident occurred.\r\n9 According to Victim 2, Appellant also abused Victim 4 at bath time. Victim 2\r\ntestified that while she was showering, Victim 4 pulled back the curtain and stared\r\nat her, just like Appellant did. When Victim 2 demanded, \"Where did you get that\r\nfrom?,\" Victim 4 responded, \"Daddy, he would look at me and touch me while I\r\nwas in the shower . . . .\" The testimony of Victim 3 corroborated this event.\r\n\nAfter all four Victims testified, the prosecution again moved to present the 404(b)\r\nWitnesses. After recognizing Appellant's renewed and continuing objection, the\r\ntrial judge allowed both 404(b) Witnesses to testify.\r\n\r\nApril, who was one of the 404(b) Witnesses, was thirty years old at the time of\r\ntrial. She testified that in the late 1980s, she often spent the night with her older,\r\nthen-nineteen-year-old cousin, Beverlyn, who was Appellant's then-live-in\r\ngirlfriend and, in due course, the mother of Victims 1, 2, and 3. April attested that\r\nduring her visits Appellant: would dry her off when she got out of the shower,\r\n\"tak[ing] his time when he got to [her genitals],\" despite her ability to dry herself;\r\nrubbed lotion on her entire body; played hide and seek with her, whereby she was\r\noften separated for long periods of time alone with Appellant; and crawled into bed\r\nwith her, placed his hand beneath her underwear, and rubbed her genitals. April\r\ntestified this abuse occurred when she was around seven or eight years old.\r\n\r\nThe other 404(b) Witness was thirty-year-old Deidra, a cousin of April. Deidra\r\ntestified that when she was approximately seven or eight years old, she often\r\naccompanied April to the home of Beverlyn and Appellant. Deidra testified that\r\nduring one overnight visit, Appellant: touched her breasts and genitals while she\r\nwatched television; \"laughed\" after inappropriately touching her breasts and\r\ngenitals, as if the contact was by accident; and laid back, placed her on top of his\r\ncrotch, and proceeded to move her up and down.\r\n\r\nThe jury ultimately convicted Appellant of three counts of a lewd act upon a child\r\n(Victims 1, 3, and 4) and one count of second degree criminal sexual conduct with\r\na minor (Victim 2). These convictions resulted in consecutive prison sentences of\r\n90 months, 90 months, 90 months, and 110 months, respectively.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in allowing the 404(b) Witnesses to testify because this\r\nevidence: (I) was not sufficiently similar to the crimes charged; and (II) was too\r\ntemporally remote and its probative value was substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice? STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a trial court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence, appellate courts\r\nrecognize that the trial judge has considerable latitude in this regard and will not\r\ndisturb such rulings absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion. State v. Whitner, 399\r\n\nS.C. 547, 557, 732 S.E.2d 861, 866 (2012); State v. Clasby, 385 S.C. 148, 154, 682\r\nS.E.2d 892, 895 (2009). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's\r\nruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is\r\nwithout evidentiary support.\" Whitner, 399 S.C. at 557, 732 S.E.2d at 866 (citation\r\nomitted).                         LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn order to admit evidence of bad acts not resulting in conviction, the trial court\r\nmust, \"[a]s a threshold matter, . . . determine whether the proffered evidence is\r\nrelevant.\" Clasby, 385 S.C. at 154, 682 S.E.2d at 895; see State v. Wallace, 384\r\nS.C. 428, 433, 683 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2009). \"If the trial judge finds the evidence to\r\nbe relevant, the judge must then determine whether the bad act evidence [is\r\nadmissible under the terms] of Rule 404(b)\" to show, inter alia, the existence of a\r\ncommon scheme or plan. Clasby, 385 S.C. at 154, 682 S.E.2d at 895. If the\r\ntestimony is relevant and proffered for a permissible purpose, the trial court must\r\nnext conduct a balancing test, pursuant to Rule 403; where the testimony's\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, the\r\ntrial court may exclude it. See State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 611, 646 S.E.2d 872,\r\n877 (2007); see also Rule 403, SCRE (\"[E]vidence may be excluded if its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . .\").\r\n\r\nAfter full consideration of this jurisprudence, we find the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in admitting the testimony of both 404(b) Witnesses. This evidence\r\n(I) demonstrated a common scheme or plan and (II) its probative value was not\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.10\r\n\r\nI.       A Common Scheme Or Plan Existed.\r\n\r\nAlthough evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is inadmissible to prove bad\r\ncharacter and, in turn, action in conformity therewith, such evidence may be\r\nadmissible to show a common scheme or plan. Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v.\r\nTaylor, 399 S.C. 51, 59, 731 S.E.2d 596, 600-01 (Ct. App. 2012). In order for bad\r\nact evidence to be admissible for this limited purpose, the trial court must find that\r\nthe evidence (A) is clear and convincing and (B) bears a close degree of similarity\r\nto the crimes charged. Clasby, 385 S.C. at 155, 682 S.E.2d at 895-96.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10   Appellant never argued the bad act testimony was not relevant.\r\n\n      A. \t   The Bad Act Evidence Was Clear and Convincing.\r\n\r\n\"'If the defendant was not convicted of the prior crime, evidence of the prior bad\r\nact must be clear and convincing.'\" Id. at 155, 682 S.E.2d at 895 (quoting State v.\r\nGaines, 380 S.C. 23, 29, 667 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2008)). In reviewing whether\r\nevidence of other bad acts is clear and convincing, an appellate court is bound by\r\nthe trial judge's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Id.\r\n\r\nWhen the State first moved to admit the bad act evidence in the instant matter, the\r\ntrial judge specifically found, \"by the clear and convincing standard that [he] was\r\nrequired to [apply] -- there is sufficient proof.\" The trial judge based this pre-trial\r\ndetermination upon the positions stated by counsel during a related hearing and\r\nwithin submitted written motions and a brief. Furthermore, the actual proffered\r\n404(b) testimony was very specific and appeared credible. In light of this support\r\nwithin the record and the deference afforded to a trial judge's findings in this\r\nregard, the trial judge did not err in finding the bad act evidence was clear and\r\nconvincing. Id. (holding a trial judge's finding that evidence of other bad acts is\r\nclear and convincing is binding, unless clearly erroneous).\r\n\r\n      B. \t   A \"Close Degree Of Similarity\" Existed Between the Crimes Charged\r\n             and the Bad Acts.\r\n\r\nWhile Appellant's brief argues that the bad act evidence was \"not sufficiently\r\nsimilar\" under Rule 404(b) and, therefore, should have been excluded, Appellant\r\ndid not directly raise this argument at trial. After jury qualification, but\r\nimmediately prior to opening arguments, the Solicitor moved to admit the bad act\r\ntestimony, arguing this testimony was relevant, clear and convincing, sufficiently\r\nsimilar, and that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger\r\nof unfair prejudice. The trial judge agreed with each of the Solicitor's contentions\r\nand even noted that the bad act evidence was \"great[ly] similar[].\" Appellant's\r\nattorney immediately took exception:\r\n\r\n             [N]otwithstanding any similarities, [the alleged bad acts]\r\n             go back to 1987. . . . [M]y position is that because of the\r\n             -- remoteness is the main thing . . . . [T]he prejudicial\r\n             effect of allowing evidence as a whole would\r\n             substantially outweigh its probative value and would be\r\n             unfair to the Defendant and highly prejudicial.\r\n             (emphases added)\r\n\nThus, it appears Appellant did not base this objection on a lack of similarity;\r\nrather, Appellant argued temporal remoteness rendered the evidence excludable\r\npursuant to Rule 403. Moreover, when the trial judge again considered the issue\r\nimmediately prior to the 404(b) Witnesses taking the stand, the trial judge again\r\nasked if Appellant had any objection. Appellant responded, \"[n]othing, other than\r\n[the earlier] objection continues.\" Therefore, it is questionable whether Appellant\r\npreserved his argument that the bad act evidence was not sufficiently similar to the\r\ncrimes charged. See State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005)\r\n(stating an objection should be sufficiently specific to bring the exact error to the\r\ntrial court's attention). Nonetheless, we address the merits of Appellant's\r\nargument. See Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC v. Lewis, 398 S.C. 323,\r\n330, 730 S.E.2d 282, 285 (2012) (stating it is \"good practice . . . to reach the merits\r\nof an issue when error preservation is doubtful\").\r\n\r\nDespite Appellant's contention to the contrary, the bad act evidence bore the\r\nrequisite degree of similarity. Evidence of other crimes or wrongs is admissible to\r\nshow a common scheme or plan when such evidence has a \"close degree of\r\nsimilarity\" to the crimes charged. Wallace, 384 S.C. at 433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278;\r\nsee Rule 404(b), SCRE (allowing evidence of a bad act to demonstrate a common\r\nscheme or plan). A close degree of similarity exists when the \"similarities\r\noutweigh the dissimilarities.\" Wallace, 384 S.C. at 433, 683 S.E.2d at 278. In\r\nconducting this similarity review, a trial court \"should consider all relevant\r\nfactors.\" Taylor, 399 S.C. at 59, 731 S.E.2d at 601 (citing Wallace, 384 S.C. at\r\n433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278). Additionally, in the context of a sexual abuse case, the\r\nfollowing factors are pertinent: (1) the age of the victims at the time of abuse; (2)\r\nthe relationship between the victims and the perpetrator; (3) the location where the\r\nabuse occurred; (4) the use of coercion or threats; and (5) the manner of the\r\noccurrence. Wallace, 384 S.C. at 433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278; Taylor, 399 S.C. at\r\n59-60, 731 S.E.2d at 601. When a review of all pertinent factors establishes a\r\n\"close degree of similarity,\" no further analysis is necessary; the evidence is\r\nadmissible. Wallace, 384 S.C. at 434, 683 S.E.2d at 278. Finally, in making this\r\nsimilarity determination, focus is upon whether each particular proffer of bad act\r\nevidence is sufficiently similar to the crimes charged, not whether multiple proffers\r\nare sufficiently similar to each other. See id. at 433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278 (holding\r\nbad act evidence must be sufficiently similar to the crimes charged).\r\n\r\nWe now apply these principles to determine whether the testimony of each 404(b)\r\nWitness was sufficiently similar to the crimes charged, such that the evidence was\r\nadmissible as evidence of a common scheme or plan. As to 404(b) Witness April,\r\nthe following similarities existed between her testimony and the crimes charged:\r\n\n          The child was approximately eight years old when first abused;\r\n          Abuse occurred when the child was under Appellant's physical\r\n           custody and control and when Appellant was the only adult present;\r\n          Abuse occurred when the child spent the night at Appellant's\r\n           residence while visiting a relative;\r\n          Abuse occurred at bath time; Appellant insisted upon washing the\r\n           child, despite the child being able to do this alone; Appellant focused\r\n           upon washing child's genitals; Appellant rubbed lotion over child's\r\n           entire body after bath time;\r\n          Abuse occurred while Appellant played \"hide and seek\" with the\r\n           children; whereby one child was separated for an extended period;\r\n          Abuse occurred when Appellant climbed into bed with the child and\r\n           placed his hands in the child's panties and rubbed her genitals.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the many similarities, only a couple of dissimilarities existed. Such\r\ndissimilarities include the facts that April was, unlike the Victims, not blood-\r\nrelated to Appellant; that Appellant did not place April on his lap and thrust her up\r\nand down, like he did with the Victims; and that April alleged a single incident of\r\nabuse. Although we recognize that these points of distinction do exist, we find the\r\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in determining these distinctions were\r\ninsufficient to outweigh the many other similarities.\r\n\r\nFirst, although April was not blood-related to Appellant, April was related to\r\nAppellant's then-live-in-girlfriend, Beverlyn. This effectively afforded Appellant\r\nan opportunity to abuse that was nearly identical to the circumstances surrounding\r\nthe Victims' allegations—a child staying overnight at Appellant's residence to visit\r\nwith a relative. Thus, any distinction based upon the reason for the abused child's\r\nvisit, whether to spend time with Appellant, as in the Victims' cases, or to visit a\r\ncousin (Beverlyn), as in April's situation, lacks merit. Second, although April did\r\nnot allege that Appellant abused her in each of the ways in which Victims were\r\nallegedly abused by Appellant, the vast majority of April's specific allegations\r\ndirectly align with those of the Victims: abuse occurred at bath time, along with the\r\ninappropriate application of lotion; abuse occurred in the child's bed just prior to\r\nbedtime; the abuse included nefarious versions of \"hide-and-seek;\" the abuse\r\noccurred when the child was approximately eight years old; and the abuse occurred\r\nduring overnight visits to a relative's home. Thus, the similarity of April's\r\ntestimony to the crimes charged outweighed the dissimilarities and the evidence\r\ncomplied with Rule 404(b). See Wallace, 384 S.C. at 433, 683 S.E.2d at 278\r\n\n(stating the requisite \"close degree of similarity\" exists when the \"similarities\r\noutweigh the dissimilarities\").\r\n\r\nAs to 404(b) Witness Deidra, the following similarities existed between her\r\ntestimony and the crimes charged:\r\n\r\n           The child was approximately eight years old when first abused;\r\n           Abuse occurred when the child was under Appellant's physical\r\n            custody and control and when Appellant was the only adult present;\r\n           Abuse occurred while the child spent the night at Appellant's\r\n            residence;\r\n           Abuse occurred while the child watched television with Appellant;\r\n           Appellant initially acted as if his improper touching was by accident;\r\n           Appellant placed the child over his crotch and thrust the child up and\r\n            down.\r\n\r\nWhile the dissimilarities include the facts that Deidra was not blood-related to\r\nAppellant, that no bath time or bedtime abuse occurred, and that Appellant did not\r\nparticipate in a game of hide-and-seek to improperly touch Deidra, the similarities,\r\nmany of which were quite peculiar, still outweigh these dissimilarities. In fact, the\r\nvast majority of Deidra's specific allegations directly align with those of the\r\nVictims: the abuse occurred when spending the night at Appellant's residence\r\nwhile visiting with a relative;11 abuse occurred when Appellant placed a child over\r\nhis crotch and thrust her up and down; abuse occurred when Appellant\r\ninappropriately touched a child under her clothes while the child watched\r\ntelevision; Appellant would laugh after inappropriately touching the child, as if the\r\nphysical contact was accidental; and the abuse occurred when the child was\r\napproximately eight years old. Accordingly, Deidra's testimony also evinced a\r\n\"close degree of similarity.\" See id. (holding a \"close degree of similarity\" exists\r\nwhen the \"similarities outweigh the dissimilarities\").\r\n\r\nIn summation, because the ages of both 404(b) Witnesses at the time of their\r\nalleged abuse, the locations and situations where these witnesses alleged Appellant\r\nabused them, and the nature and specific types of abuse alleged by these witnesses\r\nwere profoundly similar to the Victims' allegations, the similarities outweigh the\r\n\r\n\r\n11 Deidra was a cousin of April, who was a cousin of Appellant's then-live-in-\r\ngirlfriend, Beverlyn. Thus, Appellant had an attenuated familial tie to Deidra.\r\n\ndissimilarities. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding the close degree of\r\nsimilarity required to admit evidence under Rule 404(b) existed.\r\n\r\nII.   Temporal Remoteness and the 403 Balancing Test.\r\n\r\nAs Appellant's brief initially frames this issue on appeal, \"the [trial] court erred by\r\nadmitting the [404(b)] testimony [because] the alleged sexual acts were very\r\nremote.\" Thus, Appellant posits that due to remoteness alone, the bad act evidence\r\nwas inadmissible. Appellant's brief, however, further develops this contention,\r\narguing the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice because the 404(b) evidence was \"too remote\" in time.12\r\nThus, Appellant potentially raises two temporal remoteness issues: Whether\r\nadmission of bad act evidence occurring some eleven to twenty years prior to the\r\ncrimes charged (A) is an independent basis for error; and (B) constituted error\r\nbecause the temporal remoteness diminished the evidence's probative value, such\r\nthat it was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\r\n\r\n      A.     Temporal Remoteness Is Not Dispositive.\r\n\r\nAs to the first argument, a trial court does not necessarily err when it admits\r\ntestimony about a bad act occurring many years before the crimes charged. See\r\nState v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 332, n.5, 580 S.E.2d 186, 193 n.5 (Ct. App. 2003)\r\n(\"Remoteness in time, however, is not dispositive.\"); State v. Blanton, 316 S.C. 31,\r\n33, 446 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"That the alleged acts perpetrated against\r\nthe two witnesses occurred some seven to eight years prior to the alleged\r\nmolestation of [the victim], is not alone dispositive.\"). In fact, evidence of bad acts\r\noccurring many years before the charged crime is often admissible to demonstrate\r\na common scheme or plan. See State v. Hallman, 298 S.C. 172, 174-75, 379\r\nS.E.2d 115, 116-17 (1989) (holding the trial court properly admitted evidence of a\r\nbad act that occurred seven years prior to the charged crime); Blanton, 316 S.C. at\r\n33, 446 S.E.2d at 440 (holding the trial court properly admitted testimony\r\nregarding a bad act that occurred seven to eight years before the crime charged); cf.\r\nState v. Hubner, 362 S.C. 572, 584-87, 608 S.E.2d 463, 469-70 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(finding prior bad act evidence occurring some fourteen years prior to the crime\r\ncharged was improperly admitted because the evidence's probative value did not\r\n\r\n12Appellant argues, \"[due to extreme remoteness,] even if . . . sufficient\r\nsimilarities [exist,] if ever there was a case where the evidence should have been\r\nexcluded because its probative value was substantially outweighed by its unduly\r\nprejudicial effect, it was in this case.\"\r\n\noutweigh the evidence's prejudicial effect), rev'd, 384 S.C. 436, 437, 683 S.E.2d\r\n279, 280 (2009) (reversing the court of appeals, in light of Wallace, 384 S.C. 428,\r\n683 S.E.2d 275). In view of these cases and the language of Rule 404(b), courts\r\nhave considered temporal remoteness in determining whether admission is proper,\r\nbut there exists no set time limit beyond which a prior bad act is simply, per se, too\r\nremote. Compare Rule 404(b), SCRE (allowing \"[e]vidence of other crimes,\r\nwrongs, or acts\" to show \"the existence of a common scheme or plan,\" without\r\nimposing any temporal restrictions), with Rule 609(a) and (b), SCRE (generally\r\nprohibiting the admission of prior convictions to attack witness credibility if more\r\nthan ten years elapsed since the date of conviction or release from confinement).\r\nThus, the trial court did not err in admitting the bad act evidence, simply because\r\nthe evidence was purportedly too temporally remote.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Appellant cites State v. Fonseca for the proposition that even a two-\r\nyear gap between a prior bad act and the crime charged could render the evidence\r\nof the prior bad act inadmissible, because it was simply too \"remote.\" 383 S.C.\r\n640, 649, 681 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"The State provides no compelling\r\nargument of any similarities between the two occurrences, or any argument to\r\novercome the fact that the incidents are remote in time.\" (footnote omitted)); see\r\nState v. Fonseca, 393 S.C. 229, 229, 711 S.E.2d 906, 906 (2011) (\"Finding no\r\nerror in the Court of Appeals' [Fonseca] decision, we adopt it as our own and\r\ntherefore AFFIRM.\"). Although the Fonseca opinion, as adopted by our supreme\r\ncourt, incorporated the phrase \"remote in time\" within its analysis, the ultimate\r\ndetermination that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence was based upon\r\nthe bad act evidence's dissimilarity to the crime charged. In Fonseca, two separate\r\nincidents of abuse were alleged by a single victim against a single perpetrator; a\r\ntwo-year gap existed between the first incident (the bad act) and the second\r\nincident (the crime charged). Fonseca, 383 S.C. at 643-45, 681 S.E.2d at 2-3.\r\nBecause little similarity existed between the bad act and the charged offense, and\r\nbecause there was no continuous, illicit conduct, the court held the State failed to\r\nshow that the \"remote\" allegations were sufficiently similar. Id. at 649, 681 S.E.2d\r\nat 5. Thus, Fonseca's holding was based upon the lack of similarity between the\r\ntwo \"remote\" events, rather than upon the relatively short, two-year period of time\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n      B.\t    The Probative Value Was Not Substantially Outweighed By the\r\n             Danger Of Unfair Prejudice.\r\n\r\nEven when bad act evidence is sufficiently similar to the crimes charged, a trial\r\ncourt may, nonetheless, exclude the evidence when its probative value is\r\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Gillian, 373 S.C.\r\nat 611, 646 S.E.2d at 877; see also Rule 403, SCRE (\"[E]vidence may be excluded\r\nif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice .\r\n. .\"). \"Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an\r\nimproper basis.\" State v. Spears, 403 S.C. 247, 253, 742 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App.\r\n2013) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nBecause \"the result [of this Rule 403 Balancing Test] will generally turn on the\r\nfacts of each case,\" it \"must be based on the entire record.\" Clasby, 385 S.C. at\r\n156, 682 S.E.2d at 896. In the instant matter, remoteness is a fundamental fact at\r\nissue within the record and, therefore, remoteness is pertinent to determining total\r\nprobative value. See id. (requiring the balancing test of Rule 403 to consider all\r\nfacts within the record). Additionally, this Rule 403 analysis must reconsider the\r\nsimilarities and dissimilarities in determining total probative value, including a\r\nreduction in probative value predicated upon remoteness, and, in turn, whether the\r\nprobative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Taylor, 399\r\nS.C. at 61, 731 S.E.2d at 601-02 (\"We are cognizant of the prejudicial effect of\r\nadmitting evidence of [bad acts] based upon the degree of similarity with the\r\ncharged crime.\"); id (reconsidering the similarities to determine probative value);\r\nid. (weighing probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice). Therefore,\r\neven though we have already considered, pursuant to Rule 404(b), whether the\r\nsimilarities outweighed the dissimilarities, we must now reconsider the similarities\r\nand dissimilarities, as well as temporal remoteness and other factors, pursuant to\r\nRule 403, to ascertain total probative value and, subsequently, to compare this total\r\nprobative value to the danger of unfair prejudice. See Clasby, 385 S.C. at 156, 682\r\nS.E.2d at 896 (reconsidering the entire record to ascertain probative value and,\r\nsubsequently, comparing the evidence's probative value to the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice); Taylor, 399 S.C. at 61, 731 S.E.2d at 601-02 (reconsidering the\r\nsimilarities of bad act evidence to determine probative value and, subsequently,\r\ncomparing this probative value to the danger of unfair prejudice); see also Rule\r\n403, SCRE (requiring a court to determine probative value and to subsequently\r\ncompare the evidence's probative value to the danger of unfair prejudice).\r\n\r\nFor the following three reasons, the total probative value of the bad act evidence in\r\nthe instant matter was great and, as a result, not substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice. First, the similarities were not only numerous, but an\r\nextremely high level of continuity existed between both 404(b) Witnesses'\r\ntestimony and between all four Victims' testimony. Second, a high level of\r\ncontinuity extended to even the most specific acts of abuse. Third, the trial judge's\r\nfindings related to the temporal remoteness issue were specific and well-supported.\r\n\nAs to the first reason, the similarities between the bad act testimony and the\r\nVictims' allegations were not only numerous—at least nine similarities existed—\r\nmany similarities also existed between the two 404(b) Witnesses' testimonies and\r\nbetween all four Victims' allegations. Such continuity is highly probative.\r\n\r\nFor instance, much of 404(b) Witness April's testimony coincided with the\r\nVictims' specific allegations: abuse occurred when she spent the night at\r\nAppellant's residence; abuse occurred when Appellant was the only supervising\r\nadult; abuse occurred at bath time; Appellant would dry her off after a bath,\r\nfocusing on her buttocks and genitalia, despite her being self-sufficient; Appellant\r\nrubbed lotion on her entire body; Appellant played hide and seek, whereby one\r\nchild was separated from the other(s) for an extended period of time; Appellant\r\nclimbed into her bed and placed his hands in her panties and rubbed her genitals;\r\nand abuse first occurred when she was approximately eight years old. Because\r\nthese similarities were shared between the four Victims' collective testimony and\r\nApril's testimony, the evidence was highly probative.\r\n\r\nConsistently, much of Deidra's testimony also coincided with the Victims' specific\r\nallegations: abuse occurred when she spent the night at Appellant's residence;\r\nabuse occurred when Appellant was the only supervising adult; abuse occurred\r\nwhile she watched television with Appellant, whereby Appellant touched child's\r\ngenitals, buttocks, and breasts, both over and under child's clothes; Appellant\r\nplaced her over his crotch and proceeded to move her up and down (the Victims\r\nconsistently referred to this as \"hunching\"); and abuse occurred when she was\r\napproximately eight years old. Thus, the sheer number of similarities, as well as\r\nthe high incidence of overlap between both 404(b) Witnesses' testimony and the\r\ncollective Victims' testimony, carries great probative weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe fully acknowledge that 404(b) Witness Deidra did not experience the bath time\r\nassaults that April and the Victims suffered, that 404(b) Witness April did not\r\nexperience the \"hunching\" that Deidra and the Victims suffered, and that these\r\ndissimilarities do somewhat diminish probative value. However, these few\r\ndissimilarities do not result in the danger of unfair prejudice substantially\r\noutweighing the immense probative value that still remains. Further, any\r\ndissimilarity between 404(b) Witness April's testimony and 404(b) Witness\r\nDeidra's testimony is not the focus of the inquiry. See Wallace, 384 S.C. at 433-\r\n34, 683 S.E.2d at 278 (holding bad act evidence must be sufficiently similar to the\r\ncrimes charged). Rather, each 404(b) Witness's testimony must be sufficiently\r\n\nsimilar to the crimes related to the Victim's allegations. Here, the testimony of\r\neach 404(b) Witness was remarkably similar to the crimes charged, despite the fact\r\nthat each 404(b) Witness's testimony was distinguishable from the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the second reason why the probative value was not substantially\r\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, the bad act testimony was not only\r\nsimilar to the Victims' allegations, it relied upon a high level of specificity that\r\nextended to even the most peculiar conduct alleged by Victims, such as the bath\r\ntime assaults, followed by area-focused drying and full-body lotioning,\r\n\"hunching,\" laughing following an incident of abuse, and a perverse version of\r\nhide-and-seek. This high level of specificity regarding very peculiar conduct\r\nfurther increases the already great probative weight.\r\n\r\nAs to the final reason, the trial judge's findings regarding the temporal remoteness\r\nissue were specific and well-supported. The trial judge specifically found that the\r\n\"probative value is stronger and the evidence should be allowed to show . . . a\r\ncommon scheme\" and that the witnesses appeared credible. In fact, the Victims\r\n\"had never spoken to the [404(b) Witnesses] about what happened to them,\" and\r\nthe two 404(b) Witnesses had never spoken to each other about what occurred.\r\nThus, considering this absence of communication, the numerous similarities that\r\nexisted between the bad acts and the Victims' allegations, and the trial judge's on-\r\nthe-record consideration of the potential for unfair prejudice, ample support exists\r\nto negate Appellant's argument that the amount of time between the bad acts and\r\nthe crimes charged diminished probative value, such that the total probative value\r\nwas substantially outweighed by the existing danger of unfair prejudice.\r\n\r\nBased upon these three conclusions, the probative value of the 404(b) Witness\r\ntestimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\r\nAccordingly, this bad act evidence did not have an undue tendency to suggest a\r\ndecision on an improper basis. Therefore, the trial court did not err in admitting\r\nthis evidence.                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Appellant's bad\r\nacts, occurring some eleven to twenty years prior to the crimes charged. The\r\nrelated testimony (I) was sufficiently similar to the crime charged; and (II) was\r\nneither too remote nor was the evidence's probative value substantially outweighed\r\nby the danger of unfair prejudice. Appellant's convictions are\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J. and LOCKEMY, J., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5165","title":"McKinney v.

In addition, Husband\r\ncontends the family court erred in failing to award Husband attorney's fees. We\r\naffirm.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife divorced on May 3, 2006. In the family court's final order, it\r\napproved an agreement entered into by Husband and Wife, wherein Wife agreed to\r\npay Husband $1,500 per month in permanent periodic alimony. Three years later,\r\nWife sought a modification or termination of her alimony obligation based on a\r\nsubstantial change of circumstances, which included the following: (1) a decrease\r\nin Wife's income by 40%; (2) a deterioration in Wife's health; (3) Husband's\r\ncontinued cohabitation with his paramour; and (4) an increase in Husband's income\r\nby virtue of Husband's live-in paramour.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on May 11, 2011, Wife called several witnesses to testify on her\r\nbehalf. Tim Greaves, a licensed private investigator, testified in support of Wife's\r\nallegations that Husband was cohabitating with his live-in paramour, Cynthia\r\nHamby. Greaves stated he monitored Husband's house twice a day for a period of\r\nseven months starting in January 2009. Greaves stated that Hamby lived in\r\nHusband's house. Greaves testified Hamby would commute to Duncan, South\r\nCarolina, every Monday morning and remain in Duncan until Wednesday\r\nafternoon, at which time she would return to Husband's house. While in Duncan,\r\nHamby cared for her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nGreaves also observed the interior of Husband's house during this time1 and stated\r\nHamby's toiletries2 occupied the bathroom and her clothing filled a substantial\r\nportion of the master bedroom closet. Greaves observed the couple spending\r\nsignificant time together outside Husband's house and stated Husband would pay\r\nfor their groceries. He also testified that Husband and Hamby listed their status as\r\n\"engaged\" on Facebook prior to Wife filing her complaint but immediately\r\nchanged it to \"in a relationship\" once litigation commenced.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned about Husband's living arrangements, Wife stated she received a\r\nphone call from Husband's mother in January 2009. At that point, Wife began\r\ndriving by their former marital home almost every day. During this time, she\r\nobserved Hamby's vehicle parked outside Husband's house Wednesday through\r\nMonday mornings, which prompted her to hire a private investigator.\r\n\r\n1 During litigation, Husband placed his house on the market. Greaves saw the \n\r\ninterior of Husband's house when it was for sale. \n\r\n2 Greaves testified he observed numerous female products, including: a woman's \n\r\nwig, hand lotion, curlers, hair products, make-up, feminine hygiene products, \n\r\nfingernail polish, mirrors, and hair bows. \n\r\n\nIn response, Husband testified Hamby only stayed overnight on the weekends but\r\nlived with her son in Duncan throughout the week. When questioned as to why\r\nHamby's clothing and toiletries were throughout Husband's house, he stated\r\nHamby kept articles in both his house and her son's house because she traveled\r\nback and forth between the two houses. Husband admitted Hamby currently had\r\nher own key to his house as well as a key to Husband's car but claimed he gave\r\nthem to her when he was hospitalized earlier that year. He also stated that, in the\r\npast, he would purchase their groceries, but now Hamby helps buy groceries and\r\ncontributes by driving Husband around and helping clean the house. Regarding the\r\nparties' finances, Husband stated he was unemployed and was currently receiving\r\nfull-time disability. Without alimony, Husband testified he would be unable to\r\nsupport himself.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hall and Clarence Sharpe also corroborated Wife's claim that her alimony\r\nshould be reduced or terminated. Hall, a direct competitor with Wife in the\r\ntrucking insurance industry, stated that beginning in 2008, the competition to\r\ninsure trucks increased dramatically because many trucking companies were going\r\nout of business, which forced those in their industry to cut insurance rates and\r\nbecome much less profitable. Sharpe, Wife's manager, testified similarly. Sharpe\r\nstated that the increase in competition caused insurance rates, and correspondingly,\r\ncommissions for selling policies, to fall dramatically. In addition, their company\r\ndecreased the premium payouts by 5% to employees. Although Sharpe did not\r\ntestify to Wife's decrease in salary, he stated his salary had decreased by 50% in\r\nthe previous three to four years on account of the economy.\r\n\r\nIn support of Wife's claims, she testified that at the time of the parties' divorce, she\r\nnetted approximately $14,000 per month. However, her income started to decrease\r\nin 2007 because of the economic downturn. Specifically, Wife showed her yearly\r\nearnings were as follows: $230,121 in 2007; $191,700 in 2008; $128,871 in 2009;\r\nand $119,605 in 2010. Wife also stated that her health had declined since she and\r\nHusband divorced and highlighted her issues with diabetes, high blood pressure,\r\narthritis, osteoporosis, and lupus.\r\n\r\nAfter considering all the testimony and evidence, the family court issued an order\r\non August 26, 2011. In its order, the family court recounted the witnesses'\r\ntestimonies at the hearing and concluded Wife was entitled to have her alimony\r\nobligation terminated. Citing to section 20-3-130(B) of the South Carolina Code,\r\nthe family court terminated alimony, finding Husband, as the supported spouse,\r\nresided with a romantic partner on a continuous basis for greater than ninety days.\r\nDespite Hamby's absence from their residence to care for her grandchildren, the\r\n\n  family court determined Husband and Hamby continuously resided together for the\r\n  requisite ninety days. Specifically, the family court found Hamby's trips to\r\n  Duncan to care for her grandchildren were akin to out-of-town travel for work and\r\n  could not be used to circumvent the intent of the statute. Although Husband\r\n  claimed Hamby maintained a separate residence in Duncan, the family court noted\r\n  she never removed any of her personal property from Husband's house. The\r\n  family court also found Husband's testimony was not wholly credible. As a result\r\n  of the foregoing, the family court terminated Husband's alimony and declined to\r\n  award either party attorney's fees. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n  \"The family court is a court of equity.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709\r\n  S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). In appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\n  reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). \"De novo review permits appellate court fact-finding,\r\n  notwithstanding the presence of evidence supporting the [family] court's findings.\"\r\n  Lewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55. However, this broad standard of\r\n  review does not require the appellate court to disregard the factual findings of the\r\n  family court or ignore the fact that the family court is in the better position to\r\n  assess the credibility of the witnesses. Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544\r\n  S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001). Moreover, the appellant is not relieved of the burden of\r\n  demonstrating error in the family court's findings of fact. Id. at 387-88, 544 S.E.2d\r\n  at 623. Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the family court unless its\r\n  decision is controlled by some error of law or the appellant satisfies the burden of\r\n  showing the preponderance of the evidence actually supports contrary factual\r\n  findings by this court. See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55.\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n1. Termination of Alimony\r\n\r\n  Husband first contends that the family court improperly terminated Wife's alimony\r\n  obligation. We disagree.\r\n\na.    Two-Issue Rule\r\n\r\nIn Wife's brief, she claims this court should affirm the family court's decision\r\noutright because Husband failed to appeal the family court's alternative rulings.\r\nSpecifically, Wife contends the family court found Wife's decreased income and\r\ndeteriorating health were substantial changes in circumstances sufficient to merit\r\ntermination of Wife's alimony obligation pursuant to section 20-3-130(B)(1) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code. We disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the two-issue rule, \"whe[n] a decision is based on more than one\r\nground, the appellate court will affirm unless the appellant appeals all grounds\r\nbecause the unappealed ground will become law of the case.\" Jones v. Lott, 387\r\nS.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010).\r\n\r\nAlthough we agree that Wife's decrease in income and health issues could\r\nconstitute a substantial change in circumstances, based on our review of the order,\r\nwe find the family court did not rule on these issues. The order devotes several\r\npages to recounting the testimony of Wife and her witnesses as it relates to Wife's\r\nincome, the economic downturn that affected her income, and Wife's health issues.\r\nIn addition, Wife's complaint clearly sets forth these grounds as reasons to decrease\r\nor terminate her alimony obligation to Husband. However, the family court never\r\nfound these circumstances merited termination of Wife's alimony obligation.\r\nInstead, the family court's findings were solely limited to whether Husband and\r\nHamby continuously cohabitated as defined by section 20-3-130. Moreover,\r\nHusband specifically requested the family court rule on these issues in his Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP, motion, which the family court denied without a hearing or separate\r\norder. As such, we hold the two-issue rule does not bar consideration of Husband's\r\nargument on appeal.\r\n\r\nb.    On the Merits\r\n\r\nSection 20-3-130(B)(1) provides that permanent alimony and support shall\r\nterminate \"on the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse.\"\r\nUnless otherwise agreed to in writing,\r\n\r\n             \"continued cohabitation\" means the supported spouse\r\n             resides with another person in a romantic relationship for\r\n             a period of ninety or more consecutive days. The court\r\n\n            may determine that a continued cohabitation exists if\r\n            there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with\r\n            another person in a romantic relationship for periods of\r\n            less than ninety days and the two periodically separate in\r\n            order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement.\r\n\r\n§ 20-3-130(B). The supreme court further defined \"resides with\" in the context of\r\ncontinued cohabitation as \"the requirement that the supported spouse live under the\r\nsame roof as the person with whom they are romantically involved for at least\r\nninety consecutive days.\" Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 89, 650 S.E.2d\r\n465, 472 (2007) (emphasis added).3\r\n\r\nHusband concedes he and Hamby are involved in a romantic relationship.\r\nHowever, Husband claims Hamby does not live with Husband and her routine\r\nweekend stays and occasional overnight visits are not equivalent to continued\r\ncohabitation, particularly when Wife presented no evidence the two periodically\r\nseparated to circumvent the ninety-day requirement of section 20-3-130. We\r\ndisagree and find Wife presented sufficient evidence to terminate Husband's\r\nalimony.\r\n\r\nWife's private investigator testified Hamby and Husband behaved as husband and\r\nwife. The investigator observed Hamby and Husband spending five out of seven\r\nnights every week together at Husband's house for a period of at least seven\r\nmonths. We find the private investigator's extensive documentation and testimony\r\nregarding Husband and Hamby's living arrangements support our conclusion that\r\nthey shared a home on a continuous and uninterrupted basis for substantially\r\nlonger than ninety days. Although both parties agree Hamby left Husband's house\r\n\r\n3 We note that in Strickland, the supreme court defined \"continued cohabitation\" in\r\nthe context of section 20-3-150 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) as when\r\nthe supported former spouse \"resides with\" another person in a romantic\r\nrelationship for a period of ninety or more consecutive days. 375 S.C. at 89, 650\r\nS.E.2d at 472. Section 20-3-150 provides for the segregation of allowances\r\nbetween the supported spouse and his or her children and states that permanent\r\nalimony and support requirements of a supporting spouse will terminate \"upon the\r\nremarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse.\" Because the family\r\ncourt terminated Husband's alimony under section 20-3-130 and the definition of\r\n\"continued cohabitation\" is the same in sections 20-3-130 and 20-3-150, we\r\nreference only section 20-3-130 for purposes of this appeal.\r\n\nevery week to care for her grandchildren, we hold Hamby's departure was more\r\nakin to a temporary absence for out-of-town travel than it was to routine separation\r\nbased on separate residences. Further, for the reasons set forth below, we disagree\r\nwith the dissent's view that Hamby's caring for her grandchildren prevented a\r\nfinding of continued residence for at least ninety consecutive days as required by\r\nsection 20-1-130.4\r\n\r\nWife submitted evidence Hamby kept all of her personal belongings at Husband's\r\nresidence, including her clothing, undergarments, shoes, and toiletries. Husband's\r\ntestimony that Hamby only packed an \"overnight\" bag when she traveled to\r\nDuncan to care for her grandchildren lends support for the conclusion that Hamby\r\n\"lived under the same roof\" as Husband. Further, Husband admitted that he gave\r\nHamby an engagement ring and that Hamby's relationship status was listed as\r\n\"engaged\" on Facebook prior to Wife filing for termination of alimony. We are\r\nnot persuaded by Husband subsequently referring to Hamby's engagement ring as a\r\n\"friendship ring\"5 or by Hamby changing her relationship status from \"engaged\" to\r\n\"in a relationship\" immediately following Wife's initiation of this action. Rather,\r\nthis is evidence of Husband's attempt to downplay their relationship and living\r\narrangements, which we find unconvincing.\r\n\r\nWhile Husband cites to several cases in which our courts found the moving party\r\nfailed to establish the supported spouse continually cohabitated with another\r\nperson as contemplated by section 20-3-130, we find each of these cases readily\r\ndistinguishable from the instant case. See Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 482, 682\r\nS.E.2d 804, 808 (2009) (finding no bar to alimony when ex-wife and boyfriend\r\nmay have resided together for periods of two to four weeks but never for a\r\n4 The dissent also notes that Wife failed to show Hamby's caring for her\r\ngrandchildren was an intentional attempt to evade the statute's ninety-day\r\nrequirement. Because we find Wife established Hamby and Husband continuously\r\ncohabited for a period greater than ninety days, neither the family court nor this\r\ncourt need reach the issue of whether Husband and Hamby intentionally separated\r\nto circumvent the statute. See § 20-1-130(B) (\"The court may [also] determine that\r\na continued cohabitation exists if there is evidence that the supported spouse\r\nresides with another person in a romantic relationship for periods of less than\r\nninety days and the two periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day\r\nrequirement.\") (emphasis added).\r\n5 Husband also called it a \"friendship ring.\" Counsel for Wife asked, \"Did you buy\r\n[Hamby] a wedding ring? Engagement ring?\" Hamby responded, \"Yes. It's a\r\nfriendship ring.\"\r\n\ncontinuous period of ninety days and several witnesses testified ex-wife stayed\r\nwith them during the ninety days and did not want to stay with boyfriend on a full-\r\ntime basis); Biggins v. Burdette, 392 S.C. 241, 245-46, 708 S.E.2d 237, 239 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011), (finding termination of alimony not warranted when boyfriend\r\nmaintained his own residence, kept most of his personal belongings at his\r\nresidence, and routinely left when visitors stayed with supported spouse); Fiddie v.\r\nFiddie, 384 S.C. 120, 126, 681 S.E.2d 42, 45 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding ex-wife did\r\nnot continually cohabitate with a man when she lived with him sometimes but also\r\nstayed with her sister and friend several days each month so as to not \"wear out her\r\nwelcome\"); Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 544, 670 S.E.2d 669, 671-72 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2008) (affirming family court's finding of no continued cohabitation when\r\nex-wife and boyfriend were not observed living together for ninety days and when\r\nex-wife's friends and family testified she lived alone); Semken v. Semken, 379 S.C.\r\n71, 77, 664 S.E.2d 493, 497 (Ct. App. 2008) (reversing family court's termination\r\nof alimony because evidence did not demonstrate ex-wife and boyfriend lived\r\nunder the same roof for ninety consecutive days).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to conclude the parties did not continuously cohabitate for at least\r\nninety consecutive days because of Hamby's routine travel to care for her\r\ngrandchildren in Duncan would run afoul of the legislative intent underpinning this\r\nsection. To interpret this section as Husband advances would allow any break in\r\nthe ninety days to defeat a continuous cohabitation argument, rendering this\r\nsection virtually unenforceable. For example, any time a paramour and supported\r\nspouse are briefly away from each other, whether it be for an out-of-town work\r\ntrip, an overnight hospital stay, or for a weekend vacation, the family court would\r\nbe prohibited from applying this section. We do not believe the Legislature\r\nintended for such a result. See Kiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312\r\nS.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994) (\"However plain the ordinary meaning\r\nof the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to\r\naccept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have\r\nbeen intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.\");\r\ncf. Gasque v. Gasque, 246 S.C. 423, 427, 143 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1965) (concluding\r\na husband's temporary absence from South Carolina solely because of his\r\nemployment did not render him a nonresident within the meaning of the divorce\r\nlaws in the absence of clear proof of an intent to abandon his old residence and\r\nacquire a new one). Rather, the dispositive question is whether the paramour and\r\nsupported spouse continuously reside together for the requisite ninety-day period\r\nsuch that the family court could conclude they are \"living under the same roof\" for\r\npurposes of section 20-3-130. See generally S.C. Code Ann. § 59-112-10 (2004)\r\n\n  (\"The word 'residence' or 'reside' shall mean continuous and permanent physical\r\n  presence within this State, provided, that temporary absences for short periods of\r\n  time shall not affect the establishment of a residence.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-30\r\n  (2010) (\"'South Carolina resident' means a person who has established a true, fixed\r\n  principal residence and place of habitation in this State, and who intends to remain\r\n  or expects to return upon leaving without establishing residence in another state.\r\n  Temporary absences for short periods of time do not affect the establishment of\r\n  residency.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-17-2910 (2010) (\"'Home state' means the state\r\n  in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as parent for at least six\r\n  consecutive months immediately preceding the time of filing of a petition or\r\n  comparable pleading for support and, if a child is less than six months old, the state\r\n  in which the child lived from birth with any of them. A period of temporary\r\n  absence of any of them is counted as part of the six-month or other period.\").\r\n  Given the aforementioned facts, we find Husband and Hamby's living\r\n  arrangements, despite Hamby's temporary absences, amount to \"continued\r\n  cohabitation\" under section 20-3-130. Accordingly, we affirm the family court's\r\n  decision to terminate Wife's alimony obligation on this ground.\r\n\r\n2. Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\n  Next, Husband contends the family court erred when it failed to award him \n\r\n  attorney's fees. We disagree. \n\r\n\r\n  An award of attorney's fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion by the family court. Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C.\r\n  353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989). To award attorney's fees, the family court\r\n  should consider several factors, including: (1) ability of the party to pay the fees;\r\n  (2) beneficial results obtained; (3) financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the\r\n  effect a fee award will have on the party's standard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M, 307\r\n  S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\n\r\n  The family court denied both parties' requests for attorney's fees on the grounds\r\n  that Wife prevailed in the action.6 We find the family court properly exercised its\r\n\r\n  6 We note the family court should have made specific findings of fact on the record\r\n  relating to each factor from E.D.M. See Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Rule 26(a), SCRFC, and highlighting\r\n  requirement of family court to make specific findings of fact on the record about\r\n  each of the required factors from E.D.M., but noting the appellate court may make\r\n\ndiscretion. Although Wife has the superior ability to pay attorney's fees, Husband's\r\nconduct brought the parties into court. We find it would be inequitable to require\r\nWife to pay his fees in this instance, particularly when she prevailed on the merits.\r\nAdditionally, Wife incurred greater fees and costs in bringing this action and was\r\nearning substantially less on the date of the hearing than when the parties divorced.\r\nFurthermore, Husband receives monthly disability income, and although the\r\ntermination of alimony will cause his income to decrease, he has failed to prove he\r\nwill be unable to pay his fees. See Gainey v. Gainey, 279 S.C. 68, 70, 301 S.E.2d\r\n763, 764 (1983) (finding party requesting attorney's fees has burden to prove\r\nentitlement to fees and costs). Accordingly, we affirm the family court's decision\r\non this issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nKONDUROS, J., dissenting: Respectfully, I disagree with the majority regarding\r\nthe termination of Husband's alimony on the basis of continued cohabitation with\r\nHamby. According to the plain language of the statute, Wife must demonstrate by\r\na preponderance of the evidence Husband and Hamby resided together for a period\r\nof at least ninety consecutive days or establish they separated with the intent to\r\ncircumvent the ninety-day requirement. See S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-130(B) (Supp.\r\n2012). In this case, the record establishes Hamby lived with her son prior to her\r\nbecoming romantically involved with Husband. After that, the record shows that\r\nfor a period of time, she spent approximately four to five nights per week at\r\nHusband's home and the remaining nights at her son's home, where she had her\r\nown room and aided in caring for her grandchildren. This was a regular\r\noccurrence every week, demonstrating the normal course of the parties'\r\nrelationship. Caring for her grandchildren was an activity Hamby engaged in prior\r\n\r\nits own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence if the\r\nrecord is sufficient). However, because Husband never raised this deficiency in his\r\nbrief, and our review of the facts based on the preponderance of the evidence leads\r\nus to the same conclusion, we find it is appropriate to affirm the family court's\r\ndenial of attorney's fees.\r\n\nto her relationship with Husband and was not shown to be an evasive response to\r\nthe statute, which requires a showing of intent. Therefore, in my opinion, the\r\npreponderance of the evidence does not support a finding that Husband and Hamby\r\ncontinually resided together for a period of at least ninety consecutive days or that\r\nHusband and Hamby separated to avoid the termination of his alimony.\r\nFurthermore, I would remand the decision of attorney's fees to the family court for\r\nreconsideration, factoring in Husband's prevailing on the continued cohabitation\r\nissue.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5166","title":"Lawing v.

He\r\nbrought a products liability lawsuit against several entities in the supply chain for\r\nthe chemical. After a six-week jury trial, the trial court awarded substantial\r\ndamages to Lawing and two of his co-workers. Lawing nevertheless appeals,\r\narguing the trial court made two erroneous rulings. First, Lawing contends the\r\ncourt erred in finding he was not a \"user\" of the chemical and granting summary\r\njudgment against him on his strict liability claim. Second, he contends the court\r\nshould not have charged the jury on the sophisticated user doctrine. We affirm the\r\ntrial court's decision to charge the sophisticated user doctrine, but reverse the\r\ndecision to grant summary judgment because we find the trial court employed too\r\nrestrictive a definition of the term \"user.\" We remand for a new trial on Lawing's\r\nstrict liability claim.\r\n\r\n        I.    Facts\r\n\r\nEngelhard Corporation was a world leader in refining precious metals. Before\r\nEngelhard was purchased in 2006, Engelhard operated a 400,000 square-foot\r\nfacility in Seneca, where it produced a precious metal catalyst for use in the\r\nautomobile industry and reclaimed precious metals from recycled materials.1\r\nEngelhard's refining processes involved the use of sodium bromate, which is an\r\noxidizer. When heated to 700 degrees Fahrenheit, sodium bromate releases\r\noxygen, which increases combustion in an existing fire. Engelhard was using\r\napproximately 132 tons of sodium bromate per year in its refining operations at the\r\ntime of this accident.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2002, Engelhard bought sodium bromate from Univar, USA, a\r\nchemical distribution company. In December 2003, Engelhard submitted a\r\npurchase order to Univar for 170 tons of sodium bromate to cover Engelhard's\r\nanticipated needs for 2004.\r\n\r\nUnivar ordered the sodium bromate from Trinity Manufacturing, a chemical\r\nmanufacturer. Trinity did not make sodium bromate, so it contracted with its\r\nsubsidiary, Matrix Outsourcing, to obtain the product. Matrix ordered the sodium\r\n1   BASF Corporation now operates the facility.\r\n\nbromate from a Chinese exporting company, which, in turn, bought the chemical\r\nfrom a manufacturer in that country.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer packaged the sodium bromate in white plastic bags that held\r\ntwenty-five kilograms each. The bags had printing on both sides. On one side,\r\n\"PRODUCT: SODIUM BROMATE 99.7% MIN.\" appeared in black ink near the\r\ntop. Other information appeared below that, including the product code; the gross\r\nweight, tare weight, and net weight; and \"MADE IN CHINA.\" On the other side\r\nof the bags, the manufacturer printed the standard symbol for an oxidizing agent.\r\nThe symbol is a yellow diamond with black outlines. Inside the diamond is a\r\ndrawing of a flame on top of a line, followed by \"OXIDIZING AGENT\" and \"5.1\"\r\nin black ink. The United States Department of Transportation requires this symbol\r\nto be used in labeling oxidizers such as sodium bromate. See 49 C.F.R. § 172.426\r\n(2003) (requiring \"the OXIDIZER label must be as follows,\" with image of\r\nsymbol, and \"the background color on the OXIDIZER label must be yellow\").\r\n\r\nSomeone in the Chinese portion of the supply chain stacked the bags onto wooden\r\npallets and shrink-wrapped the bags onto the pallets. Each pallet contained thirty-\r\nsix bags. The shipment involved in the accident consisted of twenty pallets.\r\n\r\nThe shipment traveled from China to the port in Charleston. From there, a\r\ntrucking company delivered the shipment directly to Engelhard in February 2004.\r\nUpon the shipment's arrival at the facility, Engelhard inspected it. One of the\r\nEngelhard employees who unloaded the shipment testified that when he looked at\r\nthe pallets, some had bags with black writing on them and others had bags with the\r\noxidizer symbol. However, he testified, \"we were able to determine the difference\r\nand notice that they were the same thing because they do say 'sodium bromate' on\r\nthem.\" After inspection, Engelhard accepted the shipment, and its employees\r\nmoved it to a storage area.\r\n\r\nMatrix provided Engelhard a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for the sodium\r\nbromate. Among other things, the MSDS said, \"DANGER! OXIDIZER. Contact\r\nwith other material may cause fire,\" and sodium bromate \"[m]ay accelerate burning\r\nif involved in a fire. Containers may explode with heat. Prolonged exposure to\r\nfire or heat by the material may result in explosion.\" The MSDS also instructed\r\nusers not to store sodium bromate next to combustible materials and to keep it\r\nfrom contacting organic matter.\r\n\r\nEngelhard was already aware of the dangers described in the MSDS. Engelhard\r\nemployed between fifteen and twenty chemical engineers in its laboratory at the\r\n\nfacility in Seneca. One engineer testified he knew that sodium bromate, as an\r\noxidizer, \"was always dangerous.\" Another testified the engineers \"knew [sodium\r\nbromate] would support combustion and was an oxidizer.\" In addition, Frank\r\nLamson-Scribner, the facility's operations and production manager, was asked at\r\ntrial whether anyone working in the facility realized there was a risk that the\r\nsodium bromate could cause a fire like the one that occurred. He testified, \"I think\r\nthere are people in the plant that knew what the sodium bromate did.\"\r\n\r\nEngelhard used roughly 500 chemicals in its operations at the Seneca facility,\r\nincluding between five and ten different oxidizers. Lamson-Scribner testified that\r\nbetween fifty and seventy-five of those 500 chemicals were hazardous. To protect\r\nemployees, Engelhard provided safety training on hazardous materials and hazard\r\ncommunications. It taught employees that an MSDS contains information about a\r\nchemical and instructed them to look up the MSDS if they had a safety concern.\r\nEmployees could access copies of MSDSs using computers located in several areas\r\nof the facility. Engelhard also trained employees to recognize and understand\r\nlabels and symbols on chemical containers. One of the labels covered in that\r\ntraining was the oxidizer symbol. Finally, Engelhard taught employees that\r\noxidizers can be hazardous if exposed to combustion.\r\n\r\nIn May 2004, Engelhard moved several pallets of the sodium bromate out of\r\nstorage to a staging area in a hallway near some of the refining machinery.\r\n\r\nThe following month, Engelhard shut down the facility to perform maintenance.\r\nLawing, a maintenance worker, was part of a team assigned to replace a metal pipe\r\nsuspended from the facility's ceiling in a pipe rack. To remove the old pipe, the\r\nteam would have to cut it into pieces using a blowtorch. This would cause hot\r\nmolten bits of metal to fall from the pipe as it was being cut. The pipe rack passed\r\ndirectly over the staging area where Engelhard had chosen to store the pallets.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the accident, Engelhard had adopted a written procedure requiring\r\nthat before employees could do any maintenance work that could create an ignition\r\nsource for combustible or flammable materials, an Engelhard permit supervisor\r\nhad to issue an internal \"hot work\" permit. One of the requirements for obtaining\r\nthe permit was that immediately before the work was to begin, the supervisor of\r\nthe work had to inspect the work area for the presence of any combustible\r\nmaterials. The procedure further required that \"[a]ll such materials . . . be removed\r\nto a safe location for the duration\" of the project.\r\n\nOn the morning of June 1, 2004, Steve Knox, the leader of the pipe removal team,\r\ninspected the work area with Tim Wald, the permit supervisor. Knox noticed the\r\npallets but did not know what was in the bags. Engelhard policy required that\r\nwhen an employee encountered a substance and did not know what it was, the\r\nemployee was to contact a supervisor. Knox did not contact his supervisor about\r\nthe bags. He saw black writing on the bags, but he did not look closely enough to\r\nread it. Knox knew what the oxidizer symbol meant. He did not see such a\r\nsymbol on the bags, but he did not attempt to turn any of the bags over. No one\r\nremoved the pallets from the work area, and Wald issued the hot work permit.\r\n\r\nAfter Wald issued the permit, but before the team began working, Lawing looked\r\nat the pallets to see if there was \"[a] label or something that told [him he] needed to\r\nmove\" them. He saw nothing on the bags indicating he should not work near them.\r\nSeeing nothing to cause concern and knowing Wald had already issued the permit,\r\nhe thought the pallets \"were fine.\" Lawing testified he knew what the oxidizer\r\nsymbol meant and would have moved the bags out of the work area if had he seen\r\nthe symbol.\r\n\r\nThe team began removing the pipe later that day. Lawing's job was to stand in the\r\npipe rack and lower cut sections of the pipe down from the rack to another man in\r\na lift. At one point, while the men were working near the pallets, Knox saw a\r\n\"flash\" on one of the pallets. Within two or three seconds, an \"inferno\" \"erupted\"\r\nfrom the pallets and shot up into the pipe rack. Lawing jumped from the rack to\r\nthe lift but could not get away from the fire. The flames enveloped him, and he\r\ncould feel fire go into his mouth. Lawing does not remember whether he jumped\r\nor fell from the lift, but the drop to the floor was over twenty feet. The impact\r\nshattered his heels, ankles, and four vertebrae. He also lacerated his head in the\r\nfall. When he landed, he was still on fire. He testified, \"I thought I was going to\r\ndie. I thought I was dying.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire burned forty-two percent of Lawing's skin, including his face, ears, arms,\r\nand legs. It also burned his lungs. He needed approximately fifty stitches to close\r\nthe lacerations on his head. He spent over a month in a hospital burn unit,\r\nundergoing skin grafts, orthopedic surgeries, and other treatments. Despite Lawing\r\nreceiving over $1,000,000 in medical treatment, many of his injuries are\r\npermanent. In addition to causing severe disfigurement, the fire caused Lawing to\r\ndevelop asthma for which he will need medication for the rest of his life. He also\r\nhas trouble seeing and will need medication for his eyes, which can no longer\r\nlubricate themselves and are very sensitive to light.\r\n\n         II.   Procedural History\r\n\r\nLawing and the other two workers injured in the accident filed products liability\r\nlawsuits against Univar, Trinity, and Matrix. Lawing asserted causes of action\r\nagainst all three defendants for negligence, strict liability, and breach of implied\r\nwarranty of merchantability. In addition, he asserted a cause of action against\r\nUnivar for breach of express warranties contained in Engelhard's purchase order.2\r\nLawing asserted these causes of action under two theories: first, the defendants\r\nsupplied the sodium bromate in bags that were in a defective and unreasonably\r\ndangerous condition because the bags were made of combustible material; and\r\nsecond, the defendants failed to adequately warn of the sodium bromate's\r\n\"propensity . . . to ignite explosively in the presence of the packaging materials\r\nused.\"3\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy period of discovery, the defendants filed a joint motion for\r\nsummary judgment on Lawing's strict liability cause of action. They argued that\r\nunder section 15-73-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005), only a \"user\" or a\r\n\"consumer\" of a product may recover on a claim for strict liability, and because\r\nLawing was not using or consuming the sodium bromate when he was burned, he\r\ncould not recover in strict liability. The trial court agreed and granted the motion.\r\n\r\nThe trial court consolidated Lawing's case with the two others, and then bifurcated\r\nthe trial into liability and damages phases. In its jury charge in the liability phase,\r\nthe trial court instructed the jury on the sophisticated user doctrine. The jury\r\nreturned verdicts for all three plaintiffs on their claims against Univar for breach of\r\nexpress warranty. However, the jury returned defense verdicts on Lawing's other\r\ncauses of action.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2The purchase order provided that each package must be marked to comply with\r\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200 (2003), which is an Occupational Safety and Health\r\nAdministration hazard communication regulation, and with Department of\r\nTransportation labeling and packaging regulations.\r\n3Lawing's wife asserted a cause of action against all three defendants for loss of\r\nconsortium.\r\n4   The other two plaintiffs settled with Trinity and Matrix before trial.\r\n \r\n\nLawing filed a joint motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new\r\ntrial. He argued the trial court should not have charged the jury on the\r\nsophisticated user doctrine and should not have granted the defendants summary\r\njudgment on his strict liability cause of action. The trial court denied the motion.\r\n\r\nIn the damages phase, where the plaintiffs proceeded only against Univar, the jury\r\nawarded $1,900,000 to Lawing and $100,000 to his wife. Lawing filed a motion\r\nfor new trial additur. The trial court granted the motion and increased the award to\r\n$4,100,000. Mrs. Lawing also filed a similar motion, which the trial court denied.\r\n\r\nThe case initially came to this court as a cross-appeal: Univar filed a notice of\r\nappeal, and Lawing filed a notice of cross-appeal naming all three defendants as\r\nrespondents. While the case was pending in this court, Univar settled with\r\nLawing, leaving only Lawing's appeal against Trinity and Matrix.\r\n\r\n      III.\t Charging the Sophisticated User Doctrine\r\n\r\nLawing makes several arguments in his challenge to the trial court's decision to\r\ncharge the jury on the sophisticated user doctrine. We address them in turn.\r\n\r\n             A.\t   The Sophisticated User Doctrine Is the Law in South\r\n                   Carolina\r\n\r\nFirst, Lawing argues the sophisticated user doctrine is not the law in South\r\nCarolina. This court refuted Lawing's argument years ago in Bragg v. Hi-Ranger,\r\nInc., 319 S.C. 531, 462 S.E.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1995). In Bragg, the employee of a\r\nlarge electrical contractor died after he jumped from the bucket of an aerial bucket\r\ntruck that was on fire, and his widow sued the manufacturer. 319 S.C. at 534-35,\r\n462 S.E.2d at 323-24. The trial court charged the sophisticated user doctrine to the\r\njury, which found for the manufacturer. 319 S.C. at 534, 549, 462 S.E.2d at 323,\r\n331-32. We affirmed the decision to charge the jury on the doctrine, and thus\r\nrecognized that the sophisticated user doctrine is part of the products liability law\r\nof South Carolina. 319 S.C. at 551, 462 S.E.2d at 332.\r\n\r\nAs we will explain in section III.B of this opinion, the sophisticated user doctrine\r\nis not some complex or novel concept in products liability law. It is simply the\r\nrequirement that under the circumstances to which the doctrine applies, in\r\ndetermining whether a seller of a dangerous product acted with reasonable care in\r\nfulfilling its duty to warn, the jury must consider (1) what the purchaser already\r\nknew about the dangers associated with the product, and (2) whether under that\r\n\ncircumstance, the seller can reasonably rely on the purchaser to warn its employees\r\nand others who might come into contact with the product.\r\n\r\n             B.    The Doctrine Is Not Preempted\r\n\r\nLawing next argues that even if the doctrine is the law in this state, federal law\r\nimpliedly preempts it. He contends the sophisticated user doctrine conflicts with\r\ncertain federal regulations because it \"stands as an obstacle\" to their \"purposes and\r\nobjectives.\" See Priester v. Cromer, 401 S.C. 38, 43, 736 S.E.2d 249, 252 (2012)\r\n(stating \"any state law that conflicts with federal law is\" preempted); 401 S.C. at\r\n44, 736 S.E.2d at 252 (stating federal law impliedly preempts state law where \"the\r\nstate law 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\r\npurposes and objectives'\" of the federal law (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S.\r\n52, 67, 61 S. Ct. 399, 404, 85 L. Ed. 581, 587 (1941))). We find the doctrine is not\r\npreempted.         1.     The Sophisticated User Doctrine\r\n\r\nTo explain that the sophisticated user doctrine is not preempted, we must first\r\nexplain what it is. The sophisticated user doctrine is based on section 388 of the\r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts (1965). Bragg, 319 S.C. at 550, 462 S.E.2d at 332;\r\nsee generally David G. Owen, Products Liability Law 624 (2d ed. 2008) (stating\r\nthe \"sophisticated user doctrine[] [is an] offshoot[] of a general principle expressed\r\nin Restatement (Second) of Torts § 388\"). Section 388 is the basis of a products\r\nliability claim for negligent failure to warn. See Livingston v. Noland Corp., 293\r\nS.C. 521, 525, 362 S.E.2d 16, 18 (1987) (reciting the elements of a negligent\r\nfailure-to-warn claim in products liability (citing Gardner v. Q. H. S., Inc., 448\r\nF.2d 238, 242 (4th Cir. 1971) (applying South Carolina law and relying on section\r\n388))).5 On any negligence claim, including one for products liability, the plaintiff\r\nmust prove the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care. Branham v. Ford\r\nMotor Co., 390 S.C. 203, 210, 701 S.E.2d 5, 9 (2010). To understand the\r\nsophisticated user doctrine, it is particularly important that when determining\r\n\r\n5See also Holst v. KCI Konecranes Int'l Corp., 390 S.C. 29, 43-44, 699 S.E.2d\r\n715, 723 (Ct. App. 2010) (quoting Livingston). The supreme court in Livingston\r\nand this court in Holst did not cite section 388. However, the elements listed in\r\nboth opinions for a negligent failure-to warn claim track precisely the elements of\r\nsection 388, and those elements can be traced directly to Gardner, a Fourth Circuit\r\nopinion applying South Carolina law, in which the court relied on section 388. See\r\n448 F.2d at 242.\r\n\nwhether any defendant acted with reasonable care, the jury should consider all the\r\nsurrounding facts and circumstances. See generally Thomas v. Atl. Greyhound\r\nCorp., 204 S.C. 247, 253, 29 S.E.2d 196, 198 (1944) (\"Negligence is the want of\r\ndue care; and due care means commensurate care under all the circumstances.\").\r\n\r\nThe seller of a product is under a duty to warn the end user of dangers associated\r\nwith the use of the product. See 63A Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability § 1089 (2010)\r\n(\"The supplier has a duty to warn the ultimate user . . . .\"). Under some\r\ncircumstances, however, it may be difficult or even impossible for the seller to\r\nmeet its duty to warn the end user. One such circumstance is where, as in this\r\ncase, the seller supplies a product to an intermediary, such as a large employer\r\nwhose employees are the people who will be using the product. This circumstance\r\nis specifically addressed in comment n to section 388, entitled \"Warnings given to\r\nthird person.\" In this comment, the American Law Institute recognized that\r\nproducts \"are often supplied for the use of others, although the [products] . . . are\r\nnot given directly to those for whose use they are supplied.\" § 388 cmt. n. The\r\nInstitute explained, \"All sorts of [products] may be supplied for the use of others,\r\nthrough all sorts of third persons and under an infinite variety of circumstances.\"\r\nId.\r\n\r\nThe sophisticated user doctrine arose from the circumstances contemplated in\r\ncomment n, where a seller warns the intermediate purchaser, and relies at least in\r\npart on that purchaser to warn the end user. See O'Neal v. Celanese Corp., 10 F.3d\r\n249, 251 (4th Cir. 1993) (\"The sophisticated user defense is implicated in the\r\nsituation in which A supplies a [product] to B, B in turn allows C to be exposed to\r\nthe [product], C is injured by [the] exposure . . . , and C claims that A should be\r\nliable . . . for . . . failure to warn . . . .\"). Because the plaintiff in any negligence\r\naction must prove the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care, the question\r\nupon which the liability of a seller turns when it relies on an intermediate\r\npurchaser to warn the end user is the same as when the seller warns the end user\r\ndirectly—whether the seller acted reasonably. The American Law Institute\r\nexplained this in comment n, stating, \"In all such cases the question may arise as to\r\nwhether the person supplying the [product] is exercising . . . reasonable care, which\r\nhe owes to those who are to use it, by informing the third person through whom the\r\n[product] is supplied . . . .\" § 388 cmt. n. Our own Professor Owen has also\r\nexplained this: \"Addressing a seller's duty to warn when it sells a product to an\r\nintermediate supplier, comment n to § 388 provides that a seller may rely on the\r\nintermediary to provide warnings to the end-user if that reliance is reasonable\r\nunder the circumstances.\" Owen, supra, at 624 (emphasis added). In this\r\n\nstatement, the professor has explained the sophisticated user doctrine with all the\r\ncomplexity it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe sophisticated user doctrine does nothing more than require the jury, in\r\ndetermining whether a seller of a product acted with reasonable care in fulfilling its\r\nduty to warn, to consider what the seller knew about the sophistication of the buyer\r\nwith regard to the dangers associated with the use of the product. This is\r\nessentially what we explained in Bragg when we stated, \"In defining the\r\nsophisticated user defense, . . . 'the question is whether the supplier . . . acted\r\nreasonably in assuming that the intermediary would recognize the danger and take\r\nprecautions to protect its employees.'\" 319 S.C. at 550, 462 S.E.2d at 332 (quoting\r\nO'Neal, 10 F.3d at 253 n.2). Thus, the sophisticated user doctrine applies when\r\nthere is evidence the seller of a product was aware that an intermediate purchaser\r\nunderstood the dangers associated with the product and had the ability to\r\neffectively communicate those dangers to the end user. See O'Neal, 10 F.3d at 252\r\n(stating the sophisticated user doctrine applies \"when the supplier shows that it was\r\nreasonable to believe that a warning was unnecessary because the intermediary was\r\nalready well aware of the danger\").6 The doctrine requires the jury to consider\r\nsuch evidence in determining whether the seller acted reasonably in warning of the\r\ndangers associated with the product, and particularly whether the seller acted\r\nreasonably in the extent to which it relied on the purchaser to warn the end user.\r\n\r\nLawing's contention that the trial court erred in charging the sophisticated user\r\ndoctrine applies not only to his negligence cause of action for failure to warn, but\r\nalso to his breach of implied warranty cause of action. The sophisticated user\r\ndoctrine originated in the context of a claim for negligent failure to warn, but it\r\nalso applies to failure-to-warn causes of action based on breach of implied\r\nwarranty. See Carrel v. Nat'l Cord & Braid Corp., 852 N.E.2d 100, 109 (Mass.\r\n2006) (holding the sophisticated user doctrine applies in claims of \"negligent\r\nfailure to warn and . . . failure to warn under breach of warranty\"). This is so\r\nbecause all products liability causes of action turn on the question of\r\nreasonableness. See Branham, 390 S.C. at 210, 701 S.E.2d at 8 (stating \"all\r\nproducts liability actions, regardless of the stated theory, have common elements,\"\r\nincluding \"'that the injury occurred because the product was in a defective\r\ncondition unreasonably dangerous to the user'\" (quoting Madden v. Cox, 284 S.C.\r\n\r\n6 O'Neal was decided under Maryland law. 10 F.3d at 251. As demonstrated by\r\nthis court's reliance on it in Bragg, 319 S.C. at 550, 462 S.E.2d at 332, however, its\r\nreasoning as to the sophisticated user doctrine is no less applicable in South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\n574, 579, 328 S.E.2d 108, 112 (Ct. App. 1985))). The jury focuses on the conduct\r\nof the seller when analyzing the fault element of a negligence cause of action, but\r\nwhen analyzing the unreasonably dangerous element of any cause of action, the\r\njury focuses on the product. See Bragg, 319 S.C. at 539, 462 S.E.2d at 326 (stating\r\n\"under a negligence theory, . . . unlike strict liability, the focus is on the conduct of\r\nthe seller or manufacturer, and liability is determined according to fault\").\r\nHowever, to the same extent evidence of the purchaser's sophistication relates to\r\nwhether the seller's conduct was reasonable, the evidence also relates to whether\r\nthe product as sold under those circumstances was \"unreasonably\" dangerous.\r\n\r\n                    2.     Lawing's Preemption Argument\r\n\r\nLawing bases his preemption argument on 29 C.F.R § 1910.1200(F)(1) (2003),\r\nwhich provides that a chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor must \"ensure\r\nthat each container of hazardous chemicals leaving the workplace is labeled,\r\ntagged or marked with the following information: (i) Identity of the hazardous\r\nchemical(s); (ii) Appropriate hazard warnings; and (iii) Name and address of the\r\nchemical manufacturer, importer, or other responsible party.\"7 He also relies on 49\r\nC.F.R. §§ 172.406 and 172.407 (2003), which include requirements for the design\r\nand placement of labels, and § 172.426, which provides the specific design for the\r\noxidizer symbol. Lawing argues these regulations impose a duty on Trinity and\r\nMatrix to warn about the dangers of sodium bromate, and the sophisticated user\r\ndoctrine conflicts with the regulations because it \"has the effect of defeating the\r\nduty to warn that was clearly imposed as an integral part of the federal regulatory\r\nscheme.\" Because of this conflict, he argues, the federal regulations preempt the\r\nstate-law doctrine. See Priester, 401 S.C. at 43-44, 736 S.E.2d at 252.\r\n\r\nLawing's argument fails, however, because it depends on an incorrect premise—\r\nthat the sophisticated user doctrine, if applicable, means a supplier had no duty to\r\nwarn. As we have explained, the sophisticated user doctrine does not operate to\r\ndefeat any duty. It simply identifies circumstances the jury must consider when\r\ndetermining whether the supplier's duty to warn was breached. The Fourth Circuit\r\nexplained the error of Lawing's argument in O'Neal:\r\n\r\n             Part of the problem that may lead some to look askance\r\n             at [the sophisticated user doctrine] is in the language that\r\n\r\n7Lawing also points out that the portions of § 1910.1200 on which he relies have\r\nbeen adopted by the state Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. See 9\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. Ch. 71, Art. 1, Subart. 6 (2012).\r\n\n             some courts have used to describe it, in particular the\r\n             notion that where the elements or prerequisites of it exist,\r\n             the supplier is \"absolved\" of any duty to warn ultimate\r\n             users. That notion is not only unnecessary to the\r\n             [doctrine] but in fact is inconsistent with the rationale of\r\n             comment n to Restatement § 388. There is a duty to\r\n             warn of defects or propensities that make a product\r\n             hazardous, and that duty does extend ordinarily to those\r\n             who may reasonably be expected to use or come into\r\n             harmful contact with the product. It is not a duty, we\r\n             think, from which the supplier can be entirely absolved.\r\n             The question, rather, is, what conduct will suffice to\r\n             discharge that duty?\r\n\r\n10 F.3d at 251 (quoting Kennedy v. Mobay Corp., 579 A.2d 1191, 1199 (Md. Ct.\r\nSpec. App. 1990), aff'd, 601 A.2d 123 (Md. 1992)); see also Gray v. Badger Min.\r\nCorp., 676 N.W.2d 268, 278 (Minn. 2004) (quoting the above passage from\r\nKennedy).\r\n\r\nO'Neal, Gray, and Kennedy demonstrate that the sophisticated user doctrine does\r\nnot address the legal question of whether the supplier had a duty to warn. It could\r\nnot do so, because whether a duty exists is a question of law for the court. See\r\nEdwards v. Lexington Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 386 S.C. 285, 290, 688 S.E.2d 125,\r\n128 (2010) (stating the existence of a duty \"is a question of law for the court to\r\ndetermine\"); Doe ex rel. Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 323, 548 S.E.2d 854, 857\r\n(2001) (stating \"[t]he existence of a duty owed is a question of law for the courts\").\r\nAs the Fourth Circuit pointed out in O'Neal, \"[t]here is a duty to warn,\" 10 F.3d at\r\n251, and thus, when courts have stated that under the sophisticated user doctrine\r\nthere is no duty to warn, they have misspoken. See, e.g., Willis v. Raymark Indus.,\r\nInc., 905 F.2d 793, 796 (4th Cir. 1990) (stating that when the doctrine applies, a\r\nsupplier \"is absolved\" of its duty to warn) (effectively overruled by O'Neal, 10\r\nF.3d at 251). Rather, the sophisticated user doctrine addresses the factual question\r\nof whether it was reasonable for the supplier of a product to rely on the purchaser\r\nto warn the end user of the dangers associated with that product. In other words,\r\nthe doctrine addresses breach of duty, not the existence of duty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the sophisticated user doctrine does not stand as an obstacle to\r\nfulfillment of the safety objectives embodied in the federal regulations. On the\r\ncontrary, what the regulations require coincides with the reasonableness\r\nrequirement on which the sophisticated user doctrine is based. Here, the bags\r\n\nfeatured the words \"SODIUM BROMATE\" printed in black letters on one side and\r\nthe oxidizer symbol printed on the other. Matrix provided an MSDS that warned\r\nof fire and explosion hazards. Whether this was enough for Trinity and Matrix to\r\ncomply with the OSHA regulations—specifically the key requirement of\r\n\"[a]ppropriate hazard warnings\" under 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200(F)(1)(ii)—is\r\nprecisely the same question the jury must answer under the sophisticated user\r\ndoctrine—what was reasonable under the circumstances. See In re Welding Fume\r\nProds. Liab. Litig., 364 F. Supp. 2d 669, 696 (N.D. Ohio 2005) (stating §\r\n1910.1200 \"does not prescribe in any way the language a chemical manufacturer or\r\nother employer must use to warn about health hazards;\" it requires only that some\r\nwarning be provided and that the warning be adequate). Because the federal\r\nregulations require warnings that are \"appropriate\" under the circumstances, and\r\nthe sophisticated user doctrine requires only that certain circumstances be\r\nconsidered in determining what is reasonable (or appropriate), there is no conflict\r\nbetween the two, and the sophisticated user doctrine is not preempted.\r\n\r\n             C.     Evidence Supported Giving the Charge\r\n\r\nA trial court is required to charge principles of law that apply to the issues raised in\r\nthe pleadings and supported by the evidence at trial. Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C.\r\n369, 390, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000). Lawing argues the evidence did not warrant\r\ncharging the jury on the sophisticated user doctrine. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe sophisticated user doctrine should be charged whenever there is evidence that\r\nsupports a finding that the seller or supplier acted reasonably in relying on the\r\npurchaser to warn the end user of the dangers associated with the product. As we\r\nstated in Bragg, the question posed by the doctrine is \"whether the supplier . . .\r\nacted reasonably in assuming that the intermediary would recognize the danger and\r\ntake precautions to protect its employees.\" 319 S.C. at 550, 462 S.E.2d at 332.\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is evidence that Trinity and Matrix knew the nature of\r\nEngelhard's business, Engelhard's understanding of the dangers of sodium bromate,\r\nand the steps Engelhard took to protect employees from the dangers of hazardous\r\nmaterials. Trinity and Matrix knew the large quantities of sodium bromate they\r\nwere procuring for Univar were ultimately being sold to, and would be used by,\r\nEngelhard. They also knew that before Engelhard started buying sodium bromate\r\nfrom Univar, Engelhard inspected and tested samples of the product. A July 2002\r\nemail from Tim Griffin of Trinity to Sherry Green of Matrix discusses progress\r\nthose companies and Univar made towards becoming Engelhard's sodium bromate\r\nsupplier. The email mentions that Engelhard reviewed their proposed\r\n\nspecifications for the chemical, \"eliminate[d] the optical density\" specification, and\r\napproved the specifications after making that change. The email also states that\r\nthey delivered a sodium bromate sample to the Seneca facility, and that \"they\r\n[Engelhard] are to run lab trials and advise results.\" Explaining that email at trial,\r\nAngela Grenados, Matrix's vice president, testified Engelhard required samples be\r\ndelivered to the facility for testing. Trinity and Matrix sent Engelhard three\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\nGrenados also testified she knew Engelhard was a \"large sophisticated\r\nmanufacturer\" that used sodium bromate. At trial, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers\r\nasked Grenados whether Matrix ever visited the facility to see how Engelhard was\r\nstoring sodium bromate. She testified Matrix did not do so because \"[i]t's my\r\nimpression that Engelhard is a very sophisticated company and I'm sure their\r\nhealth and safety regulations are much beyond what my comprehension would be.\"\r\nShe never asked Engelhard about its storage and safety practices because \"I felt\r\nlike [Engelhard's] reputation went beyond my asking.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Munson was the Univar salesman who interacted with Engelhard's purchaser,\r\nDavid Williams. Munson testified Univar employed \"safety and regulatory\r\npeople\" who were available to speak with Engelhard if it had any questions or\r\nconcerns about the chemicals it bought from Univar. Univar did not visit the\r\nfacility or ask Engelhard whether it had any questions about sodium bromate and\r\nsafety. Munson testified that in his conversations with Williams, he learned\r\n\"Engelhard has very qualified people and very strict regulations and they handle\r\nthis themselves in house.\" Munson also expected Engelhard would perform hazard\r\nanalyses on the sodium bromate because it was \"the most familiar with the\r\noperations of their plant and [was] best suited to do those kinds of evaluations.\"\r\nFinally, Munson testified he knew Engelhard inspected shipments upon arrival,\r\nand if a shipment did not comply with OSHA's labeling requirements, Engelhard\r\nwould refuse it. Munson said, \"if this material had ended up in Engelhard's dock\r\nand there was anything wrong with it, I would have gotten a call from David\r\nWilliams immediately and [Williams would have] said, 'we got a problem.' We\r\nnever got a call like that.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, Griffin testified Trinity and Matrix provided the MSDS for the sodium\r\nbromate. Before the shipment would arrive, one of the two companies faxed a\r\ncopy of the MSDS to Univar. When the shipment arrived at the facility, Engelhard\r\nwould get a hard copy of the MSDS that warned about the danger that sodium\r\nbromate can accelerate existing fires and that containers of it could explode. The\r\n\nMSDS also instructed users not to store sodium bromate next to combustible\r\nmaterials and to keep it from contacting organic matter.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a whole, this evidence supports the trial court's decision to charge\r\nthe jury on the sophisticated user doctrine. It shows Trinity and Matrix knew\r\nEngelhard used large quantities of sodium bromate and had tested samples of the\r\nproduct in its laboratory before deciding to buy it. It also shows that employees of\r\nMatrix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trinity, and Univar, the company to which\r\nTrinity directly sold the sodium bromate, believed Engelhard had a safety program\r\nthat ensured employees were adequately informed of the dangers of the chemicals\r\nin the facility. Finally, it shows Trinity and Matrix knew about the MSDS and that\r\nEngelhard received it. A jury could infer from this evidence that Trinity and\r\nMatrix acted reasonably in providing warnings on the bags and in the MSDS,\r\nrelying on Engelhard to provide its employees any additional warnings about the\r\ndangers of sodium bromate. Although other evidence presented at trial could\r\nsupport a jury finding the sophisticated user doctrine did not apply, or that Trinity\r\nand Matrix did not act reasonably, those questions were ultimately for the jury.\r\nThe question we must answer is whether there is evidence in the record to support\r\ngiving the charge. We hold there is.\r\n\r\n             D.     Errors in the Substance of the Charge\r\n\r\nTherefore, the trial court correctly decided to charge the sophisticated user doctrine\r\nto the jury. See O'Neal, 10 F.3d at 252. However, the court incorrectly charged\r\nthe jury that under the doctrine, \"a distributor or supplier has no duty to warn of\r\npotential risks or dangers inherent in a product if the product is distributed to what\r\nwe call a . . . sophisticated user,\" and that \"[i]f you find that the sophisticated user\r\ndefense applies in this case, then you must find that the defendants owed no duty to\r\nwarn.\" We will not address this error, however, because it is not preserved for\r\nappellate review.\r\n\r\nAfter the jury charge, the trial court asked the lawyers if they had any objections.\r\nLawing's attorney stated, \"Other than the fact that we take exception [that] the\r\nsophisticated user charge has been given at all, because we don't think it applied.\"\r\nThus, Lawing did not make an objection to the correctness of the language of the\r\ncharge, only to whether the doctrine was applicable. Therefore, Lawing's\r\narguments regarding the substantive correctness of the charge are not preserved.\r\nSee Harris v. Univ. of S.C., 391 S.C. 518, 528, 706 S.E.2d 45, 50 (Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(finding argument regarding substance of jury charge unpreserved because it was\r\nnot raised to and ruled upon by the trial court).\r\n\nWe affirm the trial court's decision to charge the jury on the sophisticated user\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n      IV.    Granting Summary Judgment on the Strict Liability Claims\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 15-73-10 provides, \"One who sells any product in a\r\ndefective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer . . . is subject\r\nto liability for physical harm caused to the ultimate user or consumer . . . .\" See\r\nalso Bray v. Marathon Corp., 356 S.C. 111, 117, 588 S.E.2d 93, 96 (2003) (stating\r\nsection 15-73-10 \"limits liability to the user or consumer\" of a product). In\r\ngranting summary judgment against Lawing on his strict liability cause of action,\r\nthe trial court held Lawing was not a user or consumer of the sodium bromate.\r\nLawing argues the trial court took too narrow a view of the term \"user.\" We agree.\r\n\r\nThe parties' dispute over the meaning of \"user\" is a question of statutory\r\ninterpretation, the goal of which is to give effect to the legislature's intent. Kerr v.\r\nRichland Mem'l Hosp., 383 S.C. 146, 148, 678 S.E.2d 809, 811 (2009); see also\r\nBray, 356 S.C. at 117 n.6, 588 S.E.2d at 96 n.6 (noting in its discussion of section\r\n15-73-10 that \"the judiciary is limited to interpretation and construction of that\r\nstatute\"). In enacting section 15-73-10 and several related sections, the legislature\r\ndid not use specific definitions to express its intent regarding these terms. Rather,\r\nthe legislature stated that the American Law Institute's comments to section 402A\r\nof the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) are \"the legislative intent.\"8 S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-73-30 (2005). Therefore, to determine what the legislature meant\r\nby \"user,\" we look to the comments to section 402A.\r\n\r\nSeveral comments illustrate who is a user. First, comment l is entitled \"User or\r\nconsumer.\" Although the comment does not specifically define either of the terms,\r\nit indicates they are to be construed broadly. The comment explains that a person\r\nmay recover in strict liability even though he did not buy the product: \"He may be\r\na member of the family of the final purchaser, or his employee, or a guest at his\r\ntable, or a mere donee from the purchaser.\" § 402A cmt. l (emphasis added). In\r\naddition, \"'Consumers' include not only those who in fact consume the product, but\r\nalso those who prepare it for consumption.\" Id. Finally, user is not limited to\r\nsomeone actively operating or manipulating the product; rather, it \"includes those\r\nwho are passively enjoying the benefit of the product.\" Id.\r\n\r\n8Section 15-73-10 is an \"almost verbatim\" codification of section 402A. Schall v.\r\nSturm, Ruger Co., 278 S.C. 646, 648, 300 S.E.2d 735, 736 (1983).\r\n\nSecond, comment j discusses the requirement that a seller provide directions and\r\nwarnings on the container of a product. The comment contemplates that the seller\r\nwill warn people of the product's dangerous qualities so that certain people who see\r\nthe warning will not use the product. Comment j provides an example:\r\n\r\n             Where . . . the product contains an ingredient to which a\r\n             substantial number of the population are allergic, and the\r\n             ingredient is one whose danger is not generally known,\r\n             or if known is one which the consumer would reasonably\r\n             not expect to find in the product, the seller is required to\r\n             give warning against it . . . .\r\n\r\n§ 402A cmt. j. Thus, the comment contemplates that a person will \"use\" the\r\nwarning to determine whether it is safe for the person to use or consume the\r\nproduct, or in a situation like the one we face in this case, whether he should move\r\nthe product to another location before doing work that may be dangerous in the\r\nvicinity of the product.\r\n\r\nFinally, comment o helps define \"user\" and \"consumer\" by illustrating what those\r\nterms do not mean. When the American Law Institute adopted section 402A, it\r\nstated it expressed no opinion as to whether the rule should apply \"to persons other\r\nthan users or consumers.\" § 402A caveat. Explaining that caveat, comment o\r\ndescribes a \"non-user\" as a \"[c]asual bystander\" and others whose contact with the\r\nproduct is incidental, such as \"a passer-by injured by an exploding bottle, or a\r\npedestrian hit by an automobile.\" § 402A cmt. o. These examples illustrate that\r\nthe Institute intended that the people to be excluded from the definition of \"user\"\r\nand \"consumer\" are much farther removed from the product than Lawing and his\r\nco-workers were from the sodium bromate.\r\n\r\nConsidering the comments together, we believe the legislature intended that the\r\nterm \"user\" include persons who could foreseeably come into contact with the\r\ndangerous nature of a product. Thus, a person who examines a product for\r\nwarnings and other safety information is one whom the seller intends will use that\r\ninformation to avoid the dangers associated with the product, and thus is a person\r\nwho foreseeably could come into contact with its dangerous nature. Such persons\r\nenjoy the benefit of the warning by learning how to use the product safely, or by\r\nlearning that they should avoid the product altogether. They are not \"casual\r\nbystanders,\" but instead use the product by reading the warning to learn what, if\r\nanything, they can safely do with it.\r\n\nSurprisingly, there is little case law on the definition of \"user\" under section 402A.\r\nIn Patch v. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., 257 P.3d 383 (Mont. 2011), the Supreme\r\nCourt of Montana addressed a completely different factual situation that\r\nnevertheless helps us understand whether Lawing is a user on the facts of this case.\r\nIn Patch, a young man pitching in a baseball game died when he was struck by a\r\nbatted ball. 257 P.3d at 386. His parents sued the manufacturer of the bat,\r\nasserting a failure-to-warn claim under Montana's strict liability statute. Id. They\r\nclaimed the bat was defective and unreasonably dangerous because the\r\nmanufacturer did not warn that balls hit by the bat could travel with such high\r\nvelocity that other players, particularly pitchers, could be hit by the ball before\r\nnormal human reaction time would allow them to put up a hand or glove. Id. The\r\njury found for the plaintiffs. Id. On appeal, the manufacturer argued it should\r\nhave been granted summary judgment because the pitcher was not a user or\r\nconsumer of the bat. 257 P.3d at 387. It argued that the person who bought the bat\r\nand those who swung it to hit the ball were the only users or consumers under\r\nMontana's strict liability statute, and therefore the plaintiffs could not recover. Id.\r\n\r\nThe court disagreed. Noting that Montana's strict liability statute is a codification\r\nof section 402A, the court found the manufacturer's \"narrow interpretation of the\r\nterms user and consumer is contrary to the definition of the terms as contained in\"\r\nsection 402A. Id. The court reviewed comment l and found the drafters of section\r\n402A \"broadly defined\" user and consumer. Id. In light of the comment, and \"the\r\nrealities of the game of baseball,\" the court held that \"[t]he risk of harm\r\naccompanying the bat's use extends beyond the player who holds the bat in his or\r\nher hands. . . . [A]ll of the players, including [the pitcher], were users or consumers\r\nplaced at risk by the increased exit speed caused by\" the bat. 257 P.3d at 388.\r\nTherefore, the supreme court concluded the trial court did not err in denying the\r\nmanufacturer's summary judgment motion. Id.\r\n\r\nLike the bat manufacturer in Patch, Trinity and Matrix define \"user\" and\r\n\"consumer\" too narrowly by considering only whether Lawing was doing\r\nsomething with the sodium bromate at the time of the accident. They argue\r\nLawing was not a user or consumer of the sodium bromate because the chemical\r\nitself was not involved in the pipe removal operation. However, in light of the\r\ncomments discussed above illustrating the legislative intent of section 15-73-10,\r\nand the realities of modern industrial practice, we hold Lawing was a user of the\r\nsodium bromate. Warnings and other safety information on packaging are part of\r\nthe product. See § 402A cmt. h (\"No reason is apparent for distinguishing between\r\nthe product itself and the container in which it is supplied; and the two are\r\n\npurchased by the user or consumer as an integrated whole. . . . The container\r\ncannot logically be separated from the contents when the two are sold as a unit . . .\r\n.\"). Manufacturers and suppliers of chemicals and other products not only foresee,\r\nbut intend, that workers like Lawing will use the information on the packaging\r\neven if they are not actually using the chemical within the packaging. See Owen,\r\nsupra, at 621 (\"The purpose of warnings . . . is to provide information to people\r\nabout hazards and safety information they do not know about so they may avoid\r\nthe product altogether or avoid the danger by careful use.\").\r\n\r\nTrinity and Matrix make two other arguments regarding Lawing's status as a user\r\nunder section 15-73-10. First, they argue Bray supports their narrow interpretation\r\nof the term user. In Bray, the supreme court held the plaintiff was a user because\r\nshe was physically operating the trash compactor's controls at the time of her co-\r\nworker's death. 356 S.C. at 115, 116-17, 588 S.E.2d at 94, 95-96. We see nothing\r\nin Bray that contradicts our interpretation of section 15-73-10. Trinity and Matrix\r\nalso argue that even if Lawing was a user of the sodium bromate, he cannot\r\nrecover because his use was not an intended use. See Claytor v. Gen. Motors\r\nCorp., 277 S.C. 259, 264, 286 S.E.2d 129, 132 (1982) (\"A product may, by reason\r\nof its nature and use, be unreasonably dangerous unless proper instructions and\r\nwarnings are supplied for its intended use.\" (emphasis added)). This argument has\r\nthe same flaw as their argument that Lawing was not a user—it focuses exclusively\r\non the sodium bromate itself, rather than the product as a whole, including the\r\npackaging and particularly the warning. Trinity and Matrix cannot seriously\r\nsuggest they did not intend for Lawing to examine the bags for information\r\nwarning him it would be unsafe to leave them in the work area. Lawing testified\r\nhe looked at the pallets and the bags for any labels, and he saw nothing indicating\r\nhe should not work near them. In that respect, Lawing used the product exactly as\r\nTrinity and Matrix intended.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Lawing was a user of the product. By granting summary judgment\r\non the ground that he was not a user, the trial court erred.\r\n\r\n      V.     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe AFFIRM the trial court's decision to charge the jury on the sophisticated user\r\ndoctrine. However, we REVERSE the trial court's decision granting summary\r\njudgment on Lawing's strict liability cause of action, and we REMAND to the\r\ncircuit court for a new trial only on that cause of action.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5133","title":"Boykin Contracting v.

Wayne Kirby d/b/a Carolina Gold Bingo (Kirby) appeals the\r\ncircuit court's order awarding Boykin Contracting, Inc. (BCI) $59,494.31 plus\r\nprejudgment interest for electrical work performed by BCI on a bingo\r\nestablishment in Columbia, South Carolina. Kirby contends BCI failed to prove\r\nthe requisite elements of quantum meruit, requiring this court to reverse the circuit\r\ncourt's order and remand for entry of judgment in Kirby's favor. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nBCI is a licensed general and mechanical contracting firm located in West\r\nColumbia, South Carolina. BCI performs work both as a general contractor and as\r\na subcontractor. Kirby is the sole shareholder and president of Kirby Enterprises\r\nof South Carolina, Inc. (Kirby Enterprises). At times, Kirby Enterprises acted as a\r\npromoter for certain bingo operations in South Carolina. As promoter, Kirby\r\nEnterprises managed, operated, and conducted bingo sessions for non-profit\r\norganizations.1 In exchange for these services, Kirby Enterprises received a\r\nportion of the admission fee and a percentage of the bingo operation's net proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, New Covenant Church entered into negotiations with Kirby Enterprises\r\nfor the operation of a bingo parlor (Carolina Gold Bingo). As a result, Kirby\r\nexecuted a lease in 2008 with LN Dentsville Square, LLC, for two suites in a\r\nformer Winn-Dixie building in Columbia, South Carolina. The 2008 lease listed\r\n\"Wayne Kirby, d.b.a. Carolina Gold Bingo\" as \"Tenant.\"\r\n\r\nTo conduct the bingo operation, certain upfits and renovations needed to be\r\nundertaken. Initially, Hemphill & Associates, Inc. (Hemphill) was the general\r\ncontractor on the project. Kirby testified he entered into a contract with Hemphill\r\nto upfit the space for $316,400. According to Kirby, $25,000 was allotted for\r\nelectrical work in the contract. After executing the contract, Hemphill applied for\r\na building permit in the amount of $100,000 and listed \"Wayne K. Kirby\" as the\r\nowner on the building permit application. However, Kirby maintained that after\r\nbeginning the necessary renovations, the funds needed to accomplish the project\r\nwere insufficient. As a result, Hemphill ceased work on the project in November\r\n2007.\r\n\r\nThe project lay dormant until April 2008. At that time, Tom Brock (Brock), the\r\nvice-president of BCI and project manager for the renovation at issue, contacted\r\nKirby after hearing Kirby needed help to complete the electrical work at the bingo\r\nparlor. Kirby and Brock met at the work site on April 8, 2008. During this initial\r\nmeeting, Brock testified that he informed Kirby significant electrical work needed\r\nto be completed, and Kirby had likely overpaid the current electrical contractor,\r\n\r\n1Pursuant to section 12-21-3920(4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), a\r\npromoter is \"an individual, corporation, partnership, or organization licensed as a\r\nprofessional solicitor by the Secretary of State who is hired by a nonprofit\r\norganization to manage, operate, or conduct the licensee's bingo game.\"\r\n\nLarry Palmer (Palmer). Kirby requested BCI perform the remaining electrical\r\nwork under Palmer's direction. Brock testified he emphatically opposed this\r\narrangement and stated he and Kirby agreed BCI would complete the requisite\r\nwork without Palmer's supervision and would send the bill directly to Kirby.\r\nKirby, on the other hand, testified he thought BCI would be working for Palmer\r\nand would be paid from the proceeds of approximately $5,000 that remained due to\r\nPalmer for the completion of the electrical work. After their meeting, BCI\r\ncommenced work on the bingo parlor the next day.\r\n\r\nDuring the next month, BCI repaired the wiring in the main panel room located in\r\nthe rear of the building, installed lighting in the back areas not associated with the\r\nmain bingo floor, connected twenty rooftop HVAC units, repaired exterior lights\r\non the building and in the parking lot, and repaired some lighting in the Comedy\r\nClub, which was adjacent to Carolina Gold Bingo. Upon completion of BCI's\r\nwork, Kirby secured a certificate of occupancy on June 4, 2008, which listed\r\n\"Wayne K. Kirby\" as the owner. BCI subsequently hand-delivered an invoice on\r\nJuly 31, 2008, to Kirby's place of business, which was addressed to Carolina Gold\r\nBingo2 in the amount of $73,925.40. Of the amount due, $55,509.46 was allotted\r\nto labor and materials.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving no payment for its work, BCI filed a mechanic's lien in the amount\r\nof $73,925.40 on October 27, 2008. BCI then filed suit on January 12, 2009,\r\nseeking to foreclose on the mechanic's lien. After a one-day bench trial, the circuit\r\ncourt issued an order on December 30, 2011, in which it ruled the parties had no\r\nmeeting of the minds and, therefore, had no enforceable contract. However, the\r\ncircuit court held that BCI was entitled to recover the reasonable value of its labor\r\nand materials under its quantum meruit claim. Accordingly, the circuit court\r\nawarded Boykin $59,494.313 plus prejudgment interest and costs in the amount of\r\n$160. Kirby filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to reconsider, which the circuit\r\ncourt denied. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The circuit court found BCI addressed the invoice to Carolina Gold Bingo\r\nbecause this was the trade name Kirby used for the bingo operation and it was also\r\nthe trade name Kirby used on the lease for the bingo space.\r\n3 The circuit court deducted the 15% profit BCI built into the project as well as\r\n$2,760.29 in credit card charges after finding BCI failed to demonstrate these\r\ncharges were all incurred for purposes of work on Carolina Gold Bingo.\r\n\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n(1) Did the circuit court err in finding BCI could recover from Kirby on its\r\nquantum meruit cause of action?\r\n\r\n(2) Did the circuit court err in awarding BCI $59,494.31 in damages plus\r\nprejudgment interest?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"[Q]uantum meruit, quasi-contract, and implied by law contract are equivalent\r\nterms for an equitable remedy.\" QHG of Lake City, Inc. v. McCutcheon, 360 S.C.\r\n196, 202, 600 S.E.2d 105, 108 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nAs such, an action based on a theory of quantum meruit sounds in equity.\r\nColumbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129,\r\n130 (1994). When reviewing an action in equity, an appellate court reviews the\r\nevidence to determine facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\nof the evidence. Denman v. City of Columbia, 387 S.C. 131, 140, 691 S.E.2d 465,\r\n470 (2010).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Quantum Meruit\r\n\r\nKirby first contends the circuit court erred in finding BCI conferred a benefit to\r\nKirby in his individual capacity. Specifically, Kirby claims it was reversible error\r\nfor the circuit court to conclude that Kirby, as opposed to Carolina Gold Bingo or\r\nKirby Enterprises, realized value from any work performed by BCI. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe elements of a quantum meruit claim are as follows: (1) a benefit conferred\r\nupon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant;\r\nand (3) retention by the defendant of the benefit under conditions that make it\r\nunjust for him to retain it without paying its value. Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. v.\r\nUlbrich, 390 S.C. 609, 617-18, 703 S.E.2d 221, 225 (2010).\r\n\r\nIn the circuit court's order, it found quantum meruit was an appropriate remedy\r\nbecause, although there was no meeting of the minds as required for an express\r\ncontract, BCI was still entitled to recover the reasonable value of its labor and\r\n\nmaterials. We agree and find the circuit court's reasoning persuasive in resolving\r\nthis issue.\r\n\r\nFirst, BCI conferred a benefit on Kirby individually, and Kirby realized this\r\nbenefit. Although Kirby did not sign the lease on the bingo space until after the\r\nwork was completed, the court held \"it [wa]s clear that Wayne Kirby exercised\r\ndominion and control over the area designated for his bingo operations well before\r\nthis time.\"4 In support of this conclusion, the circuit court noted Kirby was listed\r\nas the \"owner\" on the building permit application, which was issued before BCI\r\nstarted work, and as \"owner\" on the certificate of occupancy, which was issued\r\nafter BCI completed its work. Although Kirby claims the circuit court improperly\r\nrelied on these documents because he did not complete these documents or own\r\nCarolina Gold Bingo, we find these designations lend support to the court's\r\nconclusion he was in fact the intended beneficiary of BCI's work. Moreover, the\r\ncircuit court acknowledged that Kirby was the point person for all the work. In\r\nthis capacity, Kirby represented to Brock, BCI's vice-president, that the project was\r\nbehind schedule and that renovations needed to be completed as soon as possible to\r\nprevent substantial financial loss.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Kirby attempts to skirt responsibility by claiming that Kirby\r\nEnterprises, as opposed to Kirby, retained any benefits from BCI's electrical work.\r\nWe disagree and find Kirby benefitted in his individual capacity from BCI's work.\r\nWe find Kirby's argument unpersuasive, particularly when Kirby directed the\r\nproject, maintained control over the premises, spent significant time on-site, and\r\nhad a direct personal stake in the success of the venture. Moreover, the circuit\r\ncourt did not need to pierce Kirby Enterprises' corporate veil to hold Kirby\r\nindividually liable. BCI never argued that Kirby Enterprises was the recipient of\r\nits services or attempted to recover against Kirby Enterprises under a corporate veil\r\ntheory. Rather, it was Kirby who raised the corporate veil theory as a defense to\r\nhis individual liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Based on our review of the record, it appears Kirby signed both the 2007 and\r\n2008 leases. The 2007 lease applied to the entire building (Comedy Club and\r\nCarolina Gold Bingo), whereas, the 2008 lease only applied to the bingo parlor.\r\nKirby's name, social security number, driver's license number, and signature\r\nappear in the 2007 lease underneath the caption \"tenant.\" When questioned, Kirby\r\naffirmed that his name was listed as a tenant in the 2007 lease.\r\n\nKirby further argues that because he did not own Carolina Gold Bingo, any work\r\nthat enabled Carolina Gold Bingo to open did not directly benefit him. We\r\ndisagree and find the language of the 2008 leasehold agreement compelling.\r\nSpecifically, the 2008 lease between LN Dentsville and Kirby, which Kirby\r\nsigned, lists the tenant as \"Wayne Kirby d.b.a. Carolina Gold Bingo.\"5 In\r\ncontemplation of this tenancy, Kirby took the initiative to hire Hemphill as general\r\ncontractor over a year prior to the execution of the 2008 lease. Kirby also\r\npossessed keys to the facility and electrical plans for the installation of lighting and\r\npower, which he gave to BCI in order to start work on the bingo parlor.\r\n\r\nBased on our review of this evidence, we find Kirby personally benefitted from\r\nBCI's successful completion of the electrical work. Because Kirby never paid BCI\r\nfor the work it undertook to upfit the bingo parlor, we find Kirby was unjustly\r\nenriched at BCI's expense. Accordingly, the circuit court properly found BCI\r\ncould recover under quantum meruit from Kirby.\r\n\r\nII. Damages\r\n\r\nNext, Kirby claims the circuit court erred in calculating the damages award and in\r\npermitting BCI to recover prejudgment interest. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe general law is that when, as here, an express contract fails because there is no\r\nmeeting of the minds as to the essential terms, the laborer or contractor may still\r\nrecover the reasonable value of the labor and materials furnished under an implied\r\nin law or quasi-contractual theory. See Costa & Sons Constr. Co. v. Long, 306\r\nS.C. 465, 468 & n.1, 412 S.E.2d 450, 452 & n.1 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing 66 Am.\r\nJur. 2d Restitution and Implied Contracts §§ 7 and 21 (1973)) (stating implied in\r\nlaw or quasi-contracts are not considered contracts at all, but are akin to restitution,\r\nwhich permits recovery of the amount the defendant has benefitted at the expense\r\nof the plaintiff in order to preclude unjust enrichment); Braswell v. Heart of\r\nSpartanburg Motel, 251 S.C. 14, 18, 159 S.E.2d 848, 850 (1968) (finding under the\r\n\r\n5 Kirby claims the circuit court erred in finding Carolina Gold Bingo was the trade\r\nname he used for the bingo operation. We find this argument disingenuous,\r\nparticularly when the 2008 lease agreement, which Kirby signed, lists the tenant as\r\n\"Wayne Kirby d.b.a. Carolina Gold Bingo\" and further lists \"tenant's trade name\"\r\nas \"Carolina Gold Bingo.\" Kirby presents no evidence that another individual\r\nentered into the lease on his behalf or that he attempted to correct this portion of\r\nthe lease, despite this alleged inaccuracy.\r\n\ntheory of implied contract, when there is no agreement as to the price to be paid for\r\nservices, one is entitled to recover the fair or reasonable value of the services\r\nrendered); Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 8, 8, 532\r\nS.E.2d 868, 872 (2000) (\"[Q]uantum meruit, quasi-contract, and implied by law\r\ncontract are equivalent terms for an equitable remedy.\"). This quasi-contractual\r\nright of recovery, also known as quantum meruit, has been defined by Black's Law\r\nDictionary as follows: \"1. The reasonable value of services; damages awarded in\r\nan amount considered reasonable to compensate a person who has rendered\r\nservices in a quasi-contractual relationship. 2. A claim or right of action for the\r\nreasonable value of services rendered.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1006 (7th ed.\r\n2000).\r\n\r\nOur courts have also held that in \"an action in quasi-contract, the measure of\r\nrecovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law, and is expressed\r\nby the amount which the court considers the defendant has been unjustly enriched\r\nat the expense of the plaintiff.\" Stringer Oil Co. v. Bobo, 320 S.C. 369, 372, 465\r\nS.E.2d 366, 369 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC\r\nv. Lewis, 398 S.C. 323, 333, 730 S.E.2d 282, 287 (2012) (Toal, C.J., concurring in\r\nresult in part and dissenting in part) (citing Stringer, 320 S.C. at 372-73, 465\r\nS.E.2d at 368-69) (stating \"[t]he proper measure of damages for an unjust\r\nenrichment claim is the amount of increase in the fair market value of the subject\r\nproperty due to the improvements made by the plaintiff\").\r\n\r\nAs to damages, Kirby contends the circuit court improperly calculated BCI's\r\ndamages based on the reasonable value of BCI's labor and materials. Relying on\r\nStringer Oil, Kirby contends the court should have measured BCI's damages by\r\ndetermining, from Kirby's perspective, the value he received from BCI's work.\r\nWe agree that the appropriate measure of recovery is expressed by the amount the\r\ndefendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff, but in the\r\ninstant case, we find this to be Boykin's costs in completing the project.\r\n\r\nWe take a moment to clarify why we choose not to apply the measure of damages\r\nadvocated by Kirby from Stringer Oil. In that case, Stringer Oil, a gasoline\r\ndistributor, sued Alton Bobo, a gasoline station owner, claiming that it made over\r\n$100,000 in improvements to the gas station with Bobo's express assurance that he\r\nwould exclusively purchase gasoline from Stringer Oil. Stringer Oil, 320 S.C. at\r\n371, 465 S.E.2d at 368. This court found Stringer Oil was only entitled to $40,000\r\nin damages, which Bobo testified was the value of the improvements to him at the\r\ntime the parties ceased doing business. Id. at 374, 465 S.E.2d at 369. Because\r\n\nStringer Oil failed to present any competing evidence on damages, this court found\r\nthat Bobo, as the owner of the gas station, was competent to present evidence on\r\nthe issue of damages. Id.\r\n\r\nWe find this case, and thus the appropriate measure of damages, distinguishable in\r\nseveral respects. First, the damages in this case are liquidated; the damages in\r\nStringer Oil were unliquidated. Id. at 372, 465 S.E.2d at 368. BCI and Kirby had\r\na quid pro quo agreement that BCI would perform certain work in exchange for\r\npayment of those services. In Stringer Oil, however, the improvements to the gas\r\nstation were made without expectation of repayment; rather, the expectation was\r\nthat Bobo would continue to buy gasoline from Stringer Oil. Id. at 371, 465 S.E.2d\r\nat 368. In addition, Boykin does not own the property on which Carolina Gold\r\nBingo is located, whereas Bobo owned the gasoline station which benefited from\r\nStringer Oil's improvements. Id. As a result, we are not persuaded that BCI's\r\nclaim should be measured by the extent to which BCI's work increased the value of\r\nthe property.\r\n\r\nWithout any competent evidence to the contrary, we find it proper to defer to the\r\ncircuit court's calculation of damages. See Stringer Oil, 320 S.C. at 374, 465\r\nS.E.2d at 369 (calculating damages on appeal based on the only competent\r\nevidence presented to master-in-equity). As reflected in BCI's invoice, BCI sought\r\n$73,925.406 from Kirby for the electrical work. The circuit court reviewed BCI's\r\njob cost analysis, which calculated the costs for the project at $62,254.60, as well\r\nas BCI's invoice to Kirby.7 From the amount owed, the circuit court deducted the\r\n15% profit BCI built into the project as well as $2,760.29 in credit card charges\r\nthat BCI failed to prove were directly attributable to work on the bingo parlor.\r\n\r\n6This figure included material, labor, taxes, insurance, overhead, and profit.\r\n7Kirby contends that if we conclude the proper measure of damages is BCI's labor\r\nand materials, the circuit court improperly calculated BCI's labor and material\r\ncosts. We disagree and note that although the invoice denotes the labor and\r\nmaterials as $55,509.46, whereas the job cost analysis denotes BCI's labor and\r\nmaterials as $62,254.60, both of these documents were in evidence and considered\r\nby the circuit court. The circuit court specifically held in its order that it based its\r\ncalculation on the \"job cost total\" as opposed to the invoice. Because the damages\r\naward was within the range of evidence presented to the court, we defer to the\r\ncircuit court's calculation. See Hawkins v. Greenwood Develop. Corp., 328 S.C.\r\n585, 601, 493 S.E.2d 875, 883 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding damages award was proper\r\nbecause it was within range of evidence presented during trial).\r\n\nAfter accounting for these deductions, the circuit court awarded $59,494.31 to\r\nBCI. The circuit court acknowledged Kirby's belief that BCI would only be paid\r\nfrom the remaining proceeds due to Palmer, which totaled approximately $5,000.\r\nHowever, the circuit court discredited this testimony based on the evidence\r\npresented to the court, which demonstrated BCI performed significant electrical\r\nwork. We find this amount to be fair and reasonable and within the circuit court's\r\ndiscretion based on the evidence presented by the parties. See Braswell, 251 S.C.\r\nat 18, 159 S.E.2d at 850 (1968) (finding that under the theory of implied contract,\r\nwhen there is no agreement as to the price to be paid for services, one is entitled to\r\nrecover the fair or reasonable value of the services rendered).\r\n\r\nKirby also claims the circuit court improperly awarded BCI prejudgment interest.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nThe law allows prejudgment interest on obligations to pay money from the time\r\nwhen, either by agreement of the parties or operation of law, the payment is\r\ndemandable and the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty. Babb\r\nv. Rothrock, 310 S.C. 350, 353, 426 S.E.2d 789, 791 (1993). The fact that the sum\r\ndue is disputed does not render the claim unliquidated for purposes of an award of\r\nprejudgment interest. Id. Further, the circuit court has the discretion to award\r\nprejudgment interest in an action to recover under the theory of quantum meruit.\r\nSee McCutcheon, 360 S.C. at 206, 600 S.E.2d at 110 (finding the entitlement to\r\nprejudgment interest proper in a quantum meruit claim). The proper test for\r\ndetermining whether prejudgment interest may be awarded in a quantum meruit\r\nclaim is whether the measure of recovery is fixed by conditions existing at the time\r\nthe claim arose. Id.\r\n\r\nWe find the circuit court properly awarded prejudgment interest because the\r\namount owed to BCI was \"capable of being reduced to a sum certain.\" In addition,\r\nthe measure of recovery was fixed by conditions existing at the time BCI's claim\r\narose against Kirby as the costs incurred by BCI at the time of the work were\r\nestablished by BCI's invoices. Kirby's disagreement with BCI over the amount due\r\nfor the work does not preclude an award of prejudgment interest. See Smith-\r\nHunger Constr. Co. v. Hopson, 365 S.C. 125, 128-29, 616 S.E.2d 419, 421 (2005)\r\n(finding builder was entitled to prejudgment interest in action against homeowners\r\nfor breach of contract, quantum meruit, and foreclosure of a mechanic's lien\r\nbecause the builder's costs were established by the builder's invoices at the time the\r\nhomeowners breached the contract and were thus \"fixed by conditions existing at\r\nthe time the claim arose\"). Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court on this issue.\r\n\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF AND KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5137","title":"Ritter and Associates v.

(\"Ritter\") brought this claim to\r\nrecover payment for twenty vehicles sold to Buchanan Volkswagen, Inc. (\"BVW\")\r\nthrough BVW's agent, Todd Taylor (\"Taylor\"). Taylor, who purchased vehicles on\r\nbehalf of various parties at a used automobile auction in Florida, conducted a\r\ncheck kiting scheme that defrauded several entities within the automobile\r\n\ndealership industry, including BVW and Ritter. BVW appeals the special referee's\r\norder finding for Ritter on its breach of contract cause of action, arguing that\r\nTaylor was not acting exclusively as BVW's agent when he purchased the vehicles\r\nand that Ritter's own negligence was the proximate cause of Ritter's damages.\r\nRitter cross-appeals, arguing that the special referee erred in finding that the South\r\nCarolina Motor Vehicle Dealer's Act did not apply to its causes of action. We\r\naffirm.               FACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nRitter is a Florida corporation that operates as a licensed used car wholesaler.\r\nRitter's offices are in close proximity to the Florida Auto Auction of Orlando\r\n(\"FAAO\"). The FAAO is a used automobile auction located in Ocoee, Florida,\r\nwhere hundreds of wholesalers and dealers purchase vehicles for resale. The\r\nFAAO is not open to the public. In order to be authorized to purchase vehicles at\r\nauction, dealers must be registered with the FAAO. In addition to buying vehicles\r\ndirectly from the auction, participants often conduct \"outside\" deals between one\r\nanother. BVW was a South Carolina Subchapter S Corporation that operated a car\r\ndealership in Charleston County. David Buchanan (\"Buchanan\") was its principal\r\nshareholder.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, BVW ceased doing business as a car dealership and remained in existence\r\nonly to rent out the parcel of real property held by BVW. In 2000, Buchanan was\r\nadvised that to retain its Subchapter S status, BVW needed to generate more than\r\njust \"passive\" rental income. To remedy this problem, Buchanan entered into a\r\nbusiness relationship with one of BVW's former employees, Todd Taylor. In 2000,\r\nBVW began operating a wholesale used car dealership whereby Taylor would\r\npurchase cars for BVW from the FAAO, and then Taylor would resell those cars\r\non BVW's behalf to other dealers in the Charleston area. To facilitate this\r\narrangement, Buchanan obtained a South Carolina Wholesale Dealer License for\r\nBVW from the South Carolina Department of Public Safety. The license listed\r\nTaylor as its employee/agent.\r\n\r\nPrior to resuming work for BVW, Taylor regularly purchased used vehicles on\r\nbehalf of a number of automobile dealers in the Charleston area from various\r\nsellers at the FAAO. During the time he was working for BVW, Taylor continued\r\nto act on behalf of other dealers to purchase automobiles from sellers at the FAAO.\r\n\r\nBecause Taylor was not authorized to purchase directly from the FAAO, he\r\nmaintained relationships with several dealers who were authorized to purchase\r\n\nvehicles at auction. These authorized dealers would purchase vehicles from the\r\nFAAO at Taylor's instruction; these dealers would then resell the vehicles to\r\nTaylor in \"outside\" deals. Ritter was an authorized dealer with whom Taylor\r\nfrequently transacted. Taylor would pay Ritter for vehicles with checks from\r\nvarious bank accounts, including accounts held by BVW and a separate company\r\nowned by Taylor. Over time, Taylor and Ritter's relationship became more\r\nfamiliar and, consequently, more casual. As a result of this increased familiarity,\r\nRitter allowed Taylor to directly deposit checks into Ritter's account to serve as\r\npayment for vehicles sold to Taylor in the outside deals.\r\n\r\nBeginning in February 2003, Taylor used this ability to deposit checks to initiate\r\nan elaborate check kiting scheme, which involved the checking accounts of BVW,\r\nRitter, a separate company owned by Taylor, and at least one other dealer in the\r\nCharleston area, Cumbee Chevrolet (\"Cumbee\"). During the duration of Taylor's\r\nkiting scheme, Ritter sold twenty vehicles to BVW through Taylor.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 2004, BVW filed a lawsuit against Taylor and several banks\r\ninvolved in the transactions. Thereafter, on April 5, 2004, Cumbee filed suit\r\nagainst Ritter, BVW, Buchanan, Taylor, and several banks involved in the\r\ntransactions. These two suits were consolidated and, following this consolidation,\r\nRitter cross-claimed against BVW and Buchanan to recover payment for the\r\ntwenty unpaid vehicles sold to BVW through Taylor.\r\n\r\nAll claims were resolved, except the cross-claims between Ritter, BVW, and\r\nBuchanan. Ritter brought claims against BVW for breach of contract, negligence,\r\nnegligent supervision, and violation of the South Carolina Dealer's Act1 (\"Dealer's\r\nAct\"). BVW brought counterclaims against Ritter for negligence per se,\r\nnegligence, civil conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The case was ultimately\r\nreferred to William L. Howard, as special referee, by a consent order signed by the\r\nHonorable R. Markley Dennis, Jr., on June 25, 2010. The case was tried without a\r\njury on January 24-26, 2011 and February 10, 2011.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, 2011, the special referee issued an order granting judgment in favor of\r\nRitter on its breach of contract claim and awarding Ritter $434,000.00 in damages\r\nand $280,286.71 in prejudgment interest. In this order, the special referee\r\nconcluded that Ritter's allegations of negligence and negligent supervision were\r\nmerely examples of the nonperformance of the contractual obligations between the\r\nparties, and therefore, granted judgment in favor of BVW on these causes of\r\n\r\n1   See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 56-15-10 to -600 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\naction. In addition, the special referee ruled that the Dealer's Act did not apply to\r\nthe business dealings between Ritter and BVW and granted judgment in favor of\r\nBVW on that cause of action. Finally, the special referee granted judgment for\r\nRitter with regard to BVW's counterclaims for negligence, negligence per se, and\r\ncivil conspiracy.           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"An action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.\"\r\nMcCall v. IKON, 380 S.C. 649, 658, 670 S.E.2d 695, 700 (Ct. App. 2008). \"An\r\naction in tort for damages is an action at law.\" Solley v. Navy Fed. Credit Union,\r\nInc., 397 S.C. 192, 202, 723 S.E.2d 597, 602 (Ct. App. 2012). \"[W]hen reviewing\r\nan action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the appellate court's\r\njurisdiction is limited to correction of errors at law, and the appellate court will not\r\ndisturb the [special referee]'s findings of fact as long as they are reasonably\r\nsupported by the evidence.\" Mazloom v. Mazloom, 382 S.C. 307, 316, 675 S.E.2d\r\n746, 751 (Ct. App. 2009).         LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. BVW's Appeal\r\n\r\nOn appeal, BVW argues the special referee erred in three respects: (1) in\r\nconcluding that Taylor was an exclusive agent of BVW; (2) in failing to apportion\r\nliability for damages to Ritter due to its own negligence; and (3) in concluding that\r\nRitter's accounting expert demonstrated a nexus between Ritter's damages and the\r\nspecific vehicles for which this suit was brought. We address each argument in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nA. Exclusivity of Taylor's Agency\r\n\r\nBVW argues that the special referee erred in concluding that Taylor was\r\nexclusively an agent of BVW and in failing to consider agency relationships that\r\nTaylor had with others. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn his order, the special referee found that \"Taylor acted on behalf of, and as the\r\nagent of BVW throughout the dealings with Ritter.\" The special referee did not\r\nfind that Taylor was an exclusive agent of BVW and did not make any findings\r\nrelated to Taylor's agency relationship with other dealers. BVW argues that the\r\nspecial referee \"at least impliedly made\" a finding that Taylor was exclusively\r\n\nBVW's agent due to the special referee's holding that BVW was liable for the\r\ncontracts formed by Taylor. BVW argues that because Taylor acted on behalf of\r\nmultiple dealerships when transacting at the FAAO, the contracts Taylor signed\r\ncould have been intended for other dealerships. BVW's position is that \"[t]he\r\nfinding of liability [under the breach of contract claim brought by Ritter] rests not\r\non the existence of an agency, but on the exclusivity of that agency.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, \"[a]gency is a question of fact.\" Gathers v. Harris Teeter Supermarket,\r\n282 S.C. 220, 226, 317 S.E.2d 748, 752 (Ct. App. 1984). \"In an action at law, on\r\nappeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be\r\ndisturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably\r\nsupports the judge's findings.\" Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C.\r\n81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). We believe there is evidence in the record that\r\nshows Taylor was BVW's agent and had authority to bind BVW in contract. See\r\nCharleston, S.C. Registry for Golf & Tourism, Inc. v. Young Clement Rivers &\r\nTisdale, LLP, 359 S.C. 635, 642, 598 S.E.2d 717, 721 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"[A]ctual\r\nauthority is that which is expressly conferred upon the agent by the principal.\").\r\nAs noted in the special referee's order, Buchanan specifically testified at the\r\nhearing that Taylor had the power to purchase vehicles, sign contracts, and issue\r\nchecks on behalf of BVW. In addition, the contracts for all twenty vehicles\r\nidentify BVW as the \"Buyer (Transferee)\" and contain Taylor's signature on the\r\nsignature line labeled \"Transferee's Signature - Buyer.\" Because Taylor had\r\nundisputed authority to enter into contracts on behalf of BVW at the time Ritter\r\nsold these vehicles to BVW, Taylor bound BVW in those contacts. Taylor's\r\nrelationship with other parties does not affect the validity of these contracts.\r\nAdditionally, we find nothing in the record indicating that Taylor intended to enter\r\ninto the purchase agreements listing BVW as the \"Buyer (Transferee)\" on behalf of\r\nsome other principal, despite BVW's claims to the contrary.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find that the special referee properly found that an\r\nagency relationship existed between Taylor and BVW. Further, we find that\r\nTaylor's agency relationships with other dealerships are immaterial as to whether\r\nthe contracts signed by Taylor on behalf of BVW are binding. Accordingly, we\r\naffirm on this issue.\r\n\r\nB. Failure to Apportion Liability for Ritter's Negligent Conduct\r\n\r\nBVW additionally argues that the special referee erred in failing to apportion\r\nliability to Ritter based upon Ritter's negligent business practices in dealing with\r\nTaylor. We disagree.\r\n\nBVW argues Ritter negligently conducted business with Taylor and that \"[e]ven\r\nthough the basis for the award sounds in contract, the negligence on Ritter's part\r\ncan serve to mitigate or even entirely subsume the amount of the award.\" BVW\r\nargues that, under the doctrine of comparative negligence, Ritter's damages should\r\nbe reduced based on the amount of fault attributable to Ritter's action or inaction.\r\n\r\nHowever, under South Carolina law, the doctrine of comparative negligence is\r\nonly applicable to cases alleging negligence as a cause of action. See Berberich v.\r\nJack, 392 S.C. 278, 286, 709 S.E.2d 607, 611 (2011) (\"[A] plaintiff in a negligence\r\naction may recover damages if his or her negligence is not greater than that of the\r\ndefendant. The amount of the plaintiff's recovery shall be reduced in proportion to\r\nthe amount of his or her negligence.\" (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks\r\nand citations omitted)). In the current case, comparative negligence is inapplicable\r\nbecause the special referee found for Ritter under a breach of contract cause of\r\naction. Thus, the special referee was correct in not reducing the award to Ritter.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm on this issue.\r\n\r\nC. Failure to Establish Damages\r\n\r\nIn its final argument, BVW argues the special referee erred in concluding Ritter\r\npresented adequate evidence that Ritter had not received payment for the twenty\r\ncars that form the basis for Ritter's damages. We disagree.\r\n\r\nBVW specifically argues that the testimony of Ellison Thomas (\"Thomas\"), Ritter's\r\nforensic accounting expert witness, was inadequate to establish that Ritter had not\r\nreceived payment for the twenty cars. BVW contends that neither Thomas nor\r\nRitter can trace with any degree of specificity the unpaid vehicles purchased by\r\nBVW from Ritter. BVW maintains that Thomas assigned responsibility for\r\npayment for these vehicles to BVW simply because \"it's the end of a kiting\r\nscheme, and somebody had to get burned\" and this unfounded assertion should not\r\nform the basis for a damages award against BVW.\r\n\r\n\"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of\r\nthe judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence\r\nwhich reasonably supports the judge's findings.\" Townes, 266 S.C. at 86, 221\r\nS.E.2d at 775.\r\n\r\nEvidence in the record supports the special referee's finding that Ritter had not\r\nbeen paid for the twenty vehicles. Specifically, the special referee found, based\r\n\nupon testimony from Ritter and Thomas, that \"between the dates of August 12,\r\n2003 and September 30, 2003, Ritter and BVW, acting through Taylor, contracted\r\nfor the sale by Ritter to Taylor of twenty motor vehicles\" and \"that Ritter has not\r\nbeen paid for those cars.\" For example, Thomas testified, \"I reviewed the records,\r\nand I reviewed the way [Ritter] tracked things and through process of elimination,\r\nthese are the vehicles that [Ritter] purchased and didn't get paid for.\" Additionally,\r\nRobert Ritter described the contents of an exhibit that listed the twenty vehicles\r\nforming the basis for the actual damages award as \"the vehicles that I sold to\r\nBuchanan Volkswagen that I was never paid for.\" Accordingly, we find that there\r\nis ample testimony in the record from Robert Ritter and Thomas to support the\r\nspecial referee's finding that Ritter was not paid for these vehicles; thus, we affirm\r\non this issue.\r\n\r\nII. Ritter's Arguments\r\n\r\nOn cross-appeal, Ritter argues that the special referee erred in three respects: (1) in\r\ndetermining the Dealer's Act did not apply to the business dealings between BVW\r\nand Ritter; (2) in declining to address Ritter's statute of limitations defense; and (3)\r\nin rejecting BVW's assertion that Florida's \"open titles\" statute was a ground for\r\nvoiding the sales contracts between the parties without first expressly determining\r\nthat the statute relied upon did not apply to the facts of this case. We address each\r\nargument in turn.\r\n\r\nA. Dealer's Act\r\n\r\nRitter argues that the special referee erred in holding that the Dealer's Act was\r\ninapplicable to Ritter and BVW's business dealings. It argues that sufficient\r\npurposeful contacts within South Carolina existed for the Dealer's Act to apply.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Dealer's Act prohibits motor vehicle dealers and manufacturers from\r\nparticipating in unfair methods of competition and deceptive trade practices. In\r\nparticular, subsection 56-15-40(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012)\r\ndeclares it unlawful \"for any . . . wholesaler . . . or motor vehicle dealer to engage\r\nin any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes\r\ndamage to any of the parties or to the public.\" The Dealer's Act applies to \"[a]ny\r\nperson who engages directly or indirectly in purposeful contacts within [South\r\nCarolina] in connection with the offering or advertising for sale [of a motor\r\nvehicle] or has business dealings with respect to a motor vehicle within [South\r\nCarolina].\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-15-20 (Supp. 2012). The Dealer's Act provides\r\n\n\"[i]n addition to temporary or permanent injunctive relief . . . , any person who\r\nshall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in [the\r\nDealer's Act] may sue therefor in the court of common pleas and shall recover\r\ndouble the actual damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a\r\nreasonable attorney's fee.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-15-110(1) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n\"The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the legislature.\" Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459\r\n(2007). \"When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is\r\nno room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to\r\nits literal meaning.\" Id. In interpreting a statute, \"[w]ords must be given their\r\nplain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit\r\nor expand the statute's operation.\" Id. at 499, 640 S.E.2d at 459. Further, \"the\r\nstatute must be read as a whole and sections which are part of the same general\r\nstatutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.\" S.C. State\r\nPorts Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe special referee found the clear language of the Dealer's Act requires either\r\npurposeful contacts within South Carolina or business dealings with respect to a\r\nmotor vehicle within South Carolina. Based on the finding that the entirety of the\r\nbusiness dealings occurred and were consummated in Florida, the special referee\r\nheld that the Dealer's Act would not apply to the business dealings between Ritter\r\nand BVW.\r\n\r\nRitter now argues that \"there need only be a sufficient nexus to South Carolina\r\nentities or South Carolina vehicles for the [Dealer's] Act to apply.\" Ritter argues\r\nthat this nexus was established because: (1) BVW was a South Carolina\r\ncorporation; (2) the parties understood that BVW intended to bring the vehicles\r\nback to South Carolina for resale to other dealerships; (3) BVW used checks issued\r\nby South Carolina banks to pay for the vehicles; and (4) South Carolina body\r\nshops performed work on the vehicles once they were transported from Florida.\r\nWe find these arguments unpersuasive.\r\n\r\nSection 56-15-20 creates two scenarios when the Dealer's Act will apply: (1) when\r\na \"person . . . engages directly or indirectly in purposeful contacts within [South\r\nCarolina] in connection with the offering or advertising for sale\" of a motor\r\nvehicle; and (2) when a person has \"business dealings with respect to a motor\r\nvehicle within [South Carolina].\" The facts of this case do not fit within either of\r\nthese scenarios. These vehicles were selected by Taylor from the FAAO, which is\r\nlocated in Florida; the contracts and bills of sale were written and signed in\r\n\nFlorida; payment was surrendered by Taylor to Ritter in Florida; and, finally, Ritter\r\ndelivered possession of the vehicles to Taylor in Florida. Therefore, any\r\npurposeful contacts within South Carolina which would put these dealings under\r\nthe first scenario contemplated by section 56-15-20 would not have occurred until\r\nafter the business dealings between Ritter and BVW were concluded. Further, at\r\nthe time the business dealings between the parties occurred, the motor vehicles\r\nwere in Florida. Therefore, the second scenario contemplated by section 56-15-20\r\nis also inapplicable.\r\n\r\nWe find that BVW's status as a South Carolina corporation and South Carolina\r\nbanks providing the checks used to complete these transactions does not amount to\r\n\"engaging . . . in purposeful contacts within [South Carolina] in connection with\r\nthe offering or advertising for sale\" of a motor vehicle. S.C. Code Ann. § 56-15-20\r\n(Supp. 2012). Further, we find that BVW's intention to transfer these vehicles\r\nback to South Carolina after completion of the sale fails to create a sufficient\r\npurposeful contact within South Carolina that would render the Dealer's Act\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nBecause the entirety of the business dealings between Ritter and BVW occurred in\r\nFlorida, we hold the special referee properly decided the Dealer's Act does not\r\napply. Thus, we affirm on this issue.\r\n\r\nB. Ritter's Additional Arguments\r\n\r\nIn addition to its argument regarding the Dealer's Act, Ritter makes two additional\r\narguments relating to the special referee's treatment of BVW's counterclaims\r\nagainst Ritter. First, Ritter argues the special referee erred in declining to address\r\nRitter's statute of limitations defense after concluding that BVW failed to prove the\r\nmerits of its counterclaims. Secondly, Ritter argues the special referee erred in\r\nrejecting BVW's assertion that Florida's \"open titles\" statute was a ground for\r\nvoiding the sales contracts between the parties without first expressly determining\r\nthat the statute relied upon did not apply to the present circumstances. We decline\r\nto address these arguments.\r\n\r\nThe special referee found in Ritter's favor with regard to BVW's counterclaims;\r\ntherefore, Ritter was not aggrieved by the special referee's order with regard to\r\nthose rulings. See Rule 201(b), SCACR (\"Only a party aggrieved by an order,\r\njudgment, sentence or decision may appeal.\").\r\n\nIn its reply brief, Ritter argues these issues are sustaining grounds. As sustaining\r\ngrounds, Ritter contends it must raise these issues or risk abandoning its claims.2\r\nWhile Ritter properly cites the law, BVW has not appealed the special referee's\r\nrulings regarding BVW's counterclaims. Because those rulings are not on appeal,\r\nthe sustaining grounds that further support those rulings need not be considered.\r\nSee McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987)\r\n(\"[W]hatever doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.\"). Accordingly, we\r\ndecline to address these arguments.CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the special referee is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2In making this argument, Ritter relies upon I'on LLC v.

Froneberger and Anna M. Froneberger (collectively,\r\nthe Fronebergers) appeal the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in\r\nfavor of Euro Mortgage Bankers, Inc. (Euro) on all but one of their causes of\r\n\naction. The Fronebergers argue the circuit court erred (1) in finding that Kirkland\r\nSmith was not Euro's actual or apparent agent, (2) in finding that Janel Smith's\r\nactions in furtherance of her husband's investment scheme were outside of her\r\nscope of employment, and (3) in improperly dismissing two of their causes of\r\naction against Euro that did not relate to the alleged agency. We agree and reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe Fronebergers are a married couple who own a home in Rock Hill, South\r\nCarolina. Euro is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in\r\nMelville, New York. From 2007 through 2009, Euro was licensed as a mortgage\r\nloan broker in South Carolina and employed Janel Smith as a mortgage loan\r\nofficer. During this time, Mrs. Smith was the sole employee of Euro for both its\r\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina offices. Mrs. Smith is married to Kirkland\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nUntil her retirement in 2008, Mrs. Froneberger was a counselor for the Catawba\r\nMental Health Center. In March 2008, Mr. Smith was referred to Catawba for a\r\nmental health evaluation, and Mrs. Froneberger was assigned to conduct his\r\nevaluation. During this evaluation, Mr. Smith engaged Mrs. Froneberger in a\r\ndiscussion about her contemplated retirement. Mr. Smith explained that he was a\r\nmortgage broker for Euro and could provide Mrs. Froneberger with an investment\r\nplan to fund her retirement. During this discussion, Mr. Smith provided Mrs.\r\nFroneberger with a business card, which identified him as the branch manager for\r\nEuro's Charlotte office.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Mrs. Froneberger told her husband about her discussion with Mr.\r\nSmith and gave him Mr. Smith's business card. Mr. Froneberger then contacted\r\nMr. Smith and made an appointment to meet Mr. Smith in Charlotte, North\r\nCarolina. On March 27, 2008, the Fronebergers traveled to Charlotte and met Mr.\r\nSmith at an office1 located in a high-rise building on Tryon Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n1The record is unclear as to whether this office was in fact the office for Euro's\r\nCharlotte branch. The Fronebergers assert that this office was the office maintained\r\nby Euro for their Charlotte branch. Euro does not deny this assertion, but instead\r\nhighlights that \"Mr. Smith's office was not marked with any signs, placards, or\r\nother indicia that the office was operated by Euro, and Mr. Smith did not wear any\r\nnametag or logo reflecting that he was affiliated with Euro.\" Throughout the\r\nFronebergers' deposition testimony, they refer to this office as \"Mr. Smith's office.\"\r\n\nAt this meeting, Mr. Smith suggested an investment plan that involved the\r\nFronebergers taking out an equity loan from Euro against their home in Rock Hill,\r\n\"so that [they] could use that money to make some investments\" for Mrs.\r\nFroneberger's retirement. Mr. Smith suggested that the Fronebergers could invest\r\ntheir loan proceeds with a large investment bank, such as \"Merrill Lynch or AIG.\"\r\nThe investment plan was premised on the assumption that the returns from their\r\ninvestment portfolio would be greater than the cost of the interest on the mortgage,\r\nand the excess could be used for Mrs. Froneberger's living expenses during\r\nretirement. The Fronebergers did not make any commitments at this March 27\r\nmeeting, indicating to Mr. Smith that they needed to talk about his\r\nrecommendations before making a decision.\r\n\r\nThe Fronebergers returned to Charlotte the following day and decided to go\r\nforward by applying for a mortgage refinancing through Euro. Mr. Smith and the\r\nFronebergers were the only people present at this second meeting. Mr. Smith had\r\nthe Fronebergers complete a Uniform Residential Loan Application. This form\r\nwas later signed by Mrs. Smith as \"interviewer\" and submitted to Euro's\r\nunderwriting department in New York. On April 10, 2008, Euro approved the loan\r\napplication, and Mr. Smith contacted the Fronebergers to convey Euro's acceptance\r\nof their application.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 2008, both Mr. and Mrs. Smith accompanied the Fronebergers to a\r\nmeeting with a Smith Barney investment advisor to determine if Smith Barney\r\nwould invest and manage the funds secured from the refinance loan. Upon\r\narriving at Smith Barney and prior to meeting with a representative, Mrs. Smith\r\nexcused herself to care for the Smiths' child and did not return. Mr. Smith and the\r\nFronebergers then met with a Smith Barney representative. This representative\r\ninformed the Fronebergers that Smith Barney did not \"do investments with equity\r\nhome loans.\" The Fronebergers and Mr. Smith then returned to Mr. Smith's office.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the office, Mr. Smith informed the Fronebergers that AIG and\r\nMerrill Lynch no longer had programs that would invest mortgage loan proceeds\r\nfor clients. Immediately following this, Mr. Smith told the Fronebergers that he\r\nbelieved he could manage their money \"about as well as\" an investment bank. Mr.\r\nSmith then told the Fronebergers about several companies that he owned or\r\noperated, including his family's trucking business. During this discussion, Mr.\r\nSmith would \"refer back\" to Euro, but never directly told the Fronebergers that\r\nEuro had any involvement with the proposed investments.\r\n\nUltimately, the Fronebergers decided to go through with Mr. Smith's proposed\r\ninvestment plan, and on April 18, 2008, the Fronebergers withdrew $20,000 from\r\ntheir savings account and delivered these funds to Mr. Smith to invest in the\r\ntrucking company. Upon receipt of these funds, Mr. Smith executed a promissory\r\nnote, promising to pay the Fronebergers \"the sum of twenty thousand 00/100\r\ndollars ($20,000.00) together with interest thereon in the sum of 5% of principal\r\none thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per month.\" The note identified \"Kirkland\r\nSmith\" as the \"Borrower\" and \"Ralph A. Froneberger & Martina A. Froneberger\"\r\nas the \"Lender.\"\r\n\r\nLater that day, the refinance loan from Euro was closed at a law office in Rock\r\nHill. Both Mrs. and Mr. Smith went to the closing. However, Mr. Smith stayed in\r\nthe car with the Smiths' infant child during the closing. Mr. Froneberger testified\r\nthat Mrs. Smith helped with the closing, but the Fronebergers \"thought she was just\r\nbeing helpful [and] didn't know she had anything to do with the business.\" After\r\npaying the closing fees and the $1,083.43 remaining balance on their previous\r\nmortgage, the closing yielded $128,432.45.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 2008, the Fronebergers gave Mr. Smith a second payment of $20,000.\r\nAgain, on June 18, 2008, the Fronebergers gave Mr. Smith a third payment for\r\n$20,000. Both of these additional payments were to be invested in Mr. Smith's\r\nfamily owned trucking business. Following each of these additional payments, Mr.\r\nSmith executed additional promissory notes. Initially, the Fronebergers received\r\nthe promised payments from Mr. Smith as returns on their investments. However,\r\nbeginning in July 2008, the checks from Mr. Smith began to bounce for having\r\n\"insufficient funds.\" Shortly thereafter, the payments stopped all together. Despite\r\nrepeated efforts, the Fronebergers were unable to get Mr. Smith to make further\r\npayments or return the money they had invested with him.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nAs a result of their transactions with the Smiths, the Fronebergers brought suit\r\nagainst Mr. Smith, Mrs. Smith, Euro, and Bank of America,2 as successor in\r\ninterest to Euro's mortgage, on June 16, 2009. The Fronebergers filed an amended\r\ncomplaint on December 14, 2009. The Fronebergers sought recovery against the\r\nSmiths and Euro jointly for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion, and\r\n\r\n2Bank of America was replaced by Countrywide Bank, who is the actual current\r\nholder of the Fronebergers' Mortgage, in the amended complaint.\r\n\nbreach of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. The Fronebergers also\r\nsought recovery against Euro for negligent hiring and retention of the Smiths, for\r\nfailure to comply with the attorney preference statute as required by section 37-10-\r\n102(a) of the South Carolina Code (2002), for rescission of the mortgage\r\ntransaction based on common-law fraud, and for rescission or reformation of the\r\nmortgage under the South Carolina Consumer Protection Code.\r\n\r\nEuro timely answered both the original complaint and the amended complaint.\r\nThe Smiths, who were pro se, each filed an answer to the original complaint, but\r\nthey failed to timely answer the amended complaint.3 In their answers to the\r\nFronebergers' complaints, Mr. and Mrs. Smith admitted Mr. Smith was an\r\nemployee of Euro.4 On February 2, 2010, the circuit court found the Smiths in\r\ndefault for their failure to respond to the amended complaint.\r\n\r\n3Mrs. Smith also provided an untimely answer to the Fronebergers' amended\r\ncomplaint.\r\n4On three separate occasions in his answer to the Fronebergers' original complaint,\r\nMr. Smith indicates that he acted as an agent or employee of Euro.\r\n\r\n      Answering the allegations of Paragraph 8 of the Complaint, Defendant\r\n      Kirkland Smith admits that Kirkland Smith represented Euro\r\n      Mortgage at the closing of the loan in Rock Hill, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      Answering the allegations of Paragraph 10 of the Complaint,\r\n      Defendant Kirkland Smith admits that he was an employee of Euro\r\n      Mortgage.\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      Answering the allegations of Paragraph 16 of the Complaint, \n\r\n      Defendant Kirkland Smith admits that his actions towards \n\r\n      accomplishing the mortgage loan transaction were made in his \n\r\n      capacity as a [sic] office manager and consultant agent of Euro \n\r\n      Mortgage. \n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mrs. Smith provided a similar statement in her untimely answer to\r\nthe amended complaint when she stated: \"Responding to Paragraph 10, Janel Smith\r\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Euro filed a motion for summary judgment with the circuit\r\ncourt. In support of this motion, Euro presented an affidavit from Lisa Vitale,\r\nEuro's president and sole stock holder, which stated that (1) Euro did not permit its\r\nemployees to provide investment advice; (2) Mrs. Smith was employed as a loan\r\noriginator from mid-2007 through mid-2009; and (3) Euro never employed Mr.\r\nSmith or authorized him to hold himself out as its agent. On December 16, 2010, a\r\nhearing was held before the circuit court to address this motion. On December 28,\r\n2010, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment on all of the\r\nFronebergers' causes of action against Euro, except their attorney preference claim,\r\nfinding that (1) Euro was not liable for the acts of Mr. Smith under a theory of\r\neither actual or apparent authority; (2) Euro was not liable for the actions of Mrs.\r\nSmith because any actions relating to her husband's solicitation of money were\r\noutside the scope of her authority; and (3) the Fronebergers' damages arose solely\r\nfrom their loans to Mr. Smith and were unrelated to the mortgage loan transaction\r\nwith Euro.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 2011, the Fronebergers filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for\r\nreconsideration, arguing that (1) sufficient evidence had been presented to preclude\r\nsummary judgment as to the issues of actual or apparent agency; and (2) Euro's\r\nmotion for summary judgment solely addressed agency and therefore should not\r\nhave affected the Fronebergers' causes of action for rescission and negligent hiring\r\nand retention. On January 20, 2011, a second hearing was held before the circuit\r\ncourt to address the Fronebergers' motion to reconsider. On March 10, 2011, the\r\ncircuit court issued a Form 4 order denying the motion for reconsideration. This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, appellate courts apply the same\r\nstandard applied by the [circuit] court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Turner v.\r\nMilliman, 392 S.C. 116, 121-22, 708 S.E.2d 766, 769 (2011). \"Summary judgment\r\nis appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and discovery on file\r\nshow there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must\r\nprevail as a matter of law.\" Id. at 122, 708 S.E.2d at 769; see also Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP. \"To determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the reviewing\r\ncourt must consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\n\r\n\r\nadmits she was an employee of Euro Mortgage Bankers. Janel Smith is of the\r\nopinion or belief that Kirkland Smith was an employee, agent, or representative of\r\nEuro.\"\r\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party.\" McLaughlin v. Williams, 379 S.C. 451, 455-\r\n56, 665 S.E.2d 667, 670 (Ct. App. 2008). To withstand a motion for summary\r\njudgment in cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the\r\nnon-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence. Hancock\r\nv. Mid–South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).\r\n\r\n\"The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the\r\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact.\" Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365\r\nS.C. 204, 220, 616 S.E.2d 722, 730 (Ct. App. 2005). \"Once the party moving for\r\nsummary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary\r\nsupport for the opponent's case, . . . the nonmoving party must come forward with\r\nspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Id. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Agency\r\n\r\nThe Fronebergers first contend that the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment because sufficient evidence was presented to create genuine issues of\r\nmaterial fact regarding the existence of an actual or apparent agency between Mr.\r\nSmith and Euro. Additionally, the Fronebergers argue that the circuit court erred\r\nin granting summary judgment based on its finding that the actions of Mrs. Smith\r\nwere outside the scope of her employment. While we agree with the circuit court's\r\ntreatment of the alleged apparent agency between Mr. Smith and Euro, we find\r\nsufficient evidence exists to withstand summary judgment as to the issue of an\r\nactual agency relationship between Mr. Smith and Euro. Further, we find that\r\nsufficient evidence exists in the record to withstand summary judgment on the\r\nquestion of whether Mrs. Smith's actions were within the scope of her\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nA. Mr. Smith's Apparent Agency\r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina law, \"[t]he elements which must be proven to establish\r\napparent agency are: (1) that the purported principal consciously or impliedly\r\nrepresented another to be his agent; (2) that there was a reliance upon the\r\nrepresentation; and (3) that there was a change of position to the relying party's\r\ndetriment.\" Graves v. Serbin Farms, Inc., 306 S.C. 60, 63, 409 S.E.2d 769, 771\r\n(1991). \"Apparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written\r\nor spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably\r\ninterpreted, causes the third person to believe the principal consents to have the act\r\n\ndone on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\" Frasier v. Palmetto\r\nHomes of Florence, Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 244-45, 473 S.E.2d 865, 868 (Ct. App.\r\n1996). \"Either the principal must intend to cause the third person to believe that\r\nthe agent is authorized to act for him, or he should realize that his conduct is likely\r\nto create such belief.\" Id. at 245, 473 S.E.2d at 868. \"Moreover, an agency may\r\nnot be established solely by the declarations and conduct of an alleged agent.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe first element of apparent agency can be established by either: (1) affirmative\r\nconduct or (2) conscious and voluntary inaction. See Watkins v. Mobil Oil Corp.,\r\n291 S.C. 62, 67, 352 S.E.2d 284, 287 (Ct. App. 1986) (discussing the elements of\r\napparent agency and finding the first element may be established \"by either\r\naffirmative conduct or conscious and voluntary inaction\"); Graves, 306 S.C. at 63,\r\n409 S.E.2d at 771 (the first element of apparent agency requires \"that the purported\r\nprincipal consciously or impliedly represented another to be his agent.\" (emphasis\r\nadded)). Under the first of these two scenarios, the principal makes direct\r\nrepresentations to a third party that another has authority to act on his behalf. See\r\nFrasier, 323 S.C. at 244, 473 S.E.2d at 868 (apparent agency is created by \"written\r\nor spoken words or any other conduct of the principal\" showing consent to allow\r\nanother to act on a principal's behalf). Under the second, the principal implies\r\nauthority by passively permitting another to appear to third parties to have\r\nauthority to act on his behalf. See R & G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp.\r\nAuth., 343 S.C. 424, 434, 540 S.E.2d 113, 118 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"Such authority is\r\nimplied where the principal passively permits the agent to appear to a third person\r\nto have the authority to act on his behalf.\"); Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140,\r\n143, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982) (\"[A]gency may be implied or inferred and may\r\nbe circumstantially proved by the conduct of the purported agent exhibiting a\r\npretense of authority with the knowledge of the alleged principal.\").\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, we hold that the Fronebergers have failed to satisfy the first\r\nelement of apparent agency, which requires \"that the purported principal\r\nconsciously or impliedly represent[] another to be his agent.\" Graves, 306 S.C. at\r\n63, 409 S.E.2d at 771 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Euro, through conduct or manifestations, ever made any\r\ndirect representation that Mr. Smith was an employee or agent of its company.\r\nThe Fronebergers stated in their deposition testimony that no one \"other than\r\nKirkland Smith ever [told them] that he was employed by Euro Mortgage\r\nBankers.\" The Fronebergers did not testify to having any contact with Euro's New\r\n\nYork office and had little contact with Mrs. Smith. In fact, the Fronebergers\r\ntestified that they did not even realize Mrs. Smith was an employee of Euro.5\r\n\r\nConsequently, the only remaining way for the Fronebergers to establish the first\r\nelement of apparent agency is to demonstrate Euro knowingly permitted Mr. Smith\r\nto appear to others to be its agent. See R & G Constr., 343 S.C. at 433, 540 S.E.2d\r\nat 118 (requiring \"acts or conduct\" demonstrating a principal \"has knowingly . . .\r\npermitted another to appear to be his agent\"). If Euro knew Mr. Smith was holding\r\nhimself out as its Charlotte office branch manager, was using its office space, and\r\nwas handing out business cards containing its logo but consciously decided not to\r\nstop or correct this behavior, then that inaction could serve as conduct to satisfy the\r\nfirst element. However, we find that the Fronebergers have failed to demonstrate\r\nevidence indicating Euro knew Mr. Smith was acting in this manner. Without\r\nknowledge of Mr. Smith's conduct, Euro cannot have permitted this behavior with\r\nconscious inaction. See Fernander, 278 S.C. at 143, 293 S.E.2d at 426 (\"[A]gency\r\nmay be . . . proved circumstantially by the conduct of the purported agent\r\nexhibiting a pretense of authority with the knowledge of the alleged principal.\"\r\n(emphasis added)). Accordingly, the record contains no evidence that Euro, by any\r\nacts or conduct, knowingly caused or passively permitted Mr. Smith to appear to\r\nbe its agent.\r\n\r\nBecause this first element fails, we need not consider the remaining elements\r\nrequired to prove apparent agency. We find there is no genuine issue of material\r\nfact regarding an apparent agency relationship between Mr. Smith and Euro.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court properly found Euro was entitled to judgment as a\r\nmatter of law on the apparent agency issue.\r\n\r\nB. Mr. Smith's Actual Agency\r\n\r\nAlthough we agree with the circuit court's treatment of the apparent agency issue,\r\nwe find that there is evidence in the record creating a genuine issue regarding an\r\nactual agency relationship between Euro and Mr. Smith, sufficient to survive a\r\nmotion for summary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Mr. Froneberger stated, \"[w]e just saw [Mrs. Smith] only as [Mr. Smith's] wife.\r\nWe didn’t even know that she was involved at all.\" Mrs. Froneberger provided a\r\nsimilar view when she said, \"I thought [Mrs. Smith] was just [Mr. Smith's] wife\r\njust coming in talking to him in his office.\"\r\n\n\"Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a 'principal')\r\nmanifests assent to another person (an 'agent') that the agent shall act on the\r\nprincipal's behalf and subject to the principal's control.\" Restatement (Third) of\r\nAgency § 1.01 (2006). Generally, \"[a]gency is a question of fact.\" Gathers v.\r\nHarris Teeter Supermarket, Inc., 282 S.C. 220, 226, 317 S.E.2d 748, 752 (Ct. App.\r\n1984). \"[Q]uestions of agency ordinarily should not be resolved by summary\r\njudgment where there are any facts giving rise to an inference of an agency\r\nrelationship.\" Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 142, 293 S.E.2d 424, 425\r\n(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"If there are any facts tending to prove\r\nthe relationship of agency, it then becomes a question for the jury[,]\" and the grant\r\nof summary judgment is inappropriate. Gathers, 282 S.C. at 226, 317 S.E.2d at\r\n752.\r\n\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court should examine\r\nthe \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\ntogether with [any] affidavits\" to determine if \"there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock\r\nCtr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 134, 638 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2006). In the case at hand, the\r\ncircuit court granted summary judgment to Euro based on its finding that it was\r\n\"undisputed that Mr. Smith was never an employee of Euro.\" However, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Smith both indicate in their answers to the Fronebergers' complaints that Mr.\r\nSmith was in fact an employee of Euro. These admissions in the Smiths' answers\r\nare contrary to Euro's president's affidavit submitted with Euro's motion for\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is well settled in South Carolina that a party \"may not rest upon the mere\r\nallegations or denials of his pleading\" to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\r\nRule 56(e), SCRCP; see also Strickland v. Madden, 323 S.C. 63, 68, 448 S.E.2d\r\n581, 584 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating \"an adverse party may not rely on the mere\r\nallegations in his pleadings to withstand a summary judgment motion\"). However,\r\nin the instant case, the Fronebergers are not merely relying on the allegations of\r\ntheir own pleadings. Instead, they point to the pleadings provided by adverse\r\nparties containing admissions that indicate the existence of an agency relationship\r\nbetween Mr. Smith and Euro.\r\n\r\nThe dissent argues that the Fronebergers failed to present any evidence of an\r\nagency relationship because the Smiths' answers \"contain only the bare conclusion\r\nthat [Mr. Smith] was an agent\" while failing to provide evidence to support this\r\nconclusion. We disagree. Rule 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\nrequires the circuit court to consider the submitted pleadings, along with\r\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits, when ruling on\r\nsummary judgment. The Fronebergers directed the circuit court's attention to the\r\nSmiths' pleadings as evidence of an actual agency in both their return to summary\r\njudgment and their motion for reconsideration. We believe the admissions in the\r\nSmiths' pleadings satisfy the mere scintilla of evidence required to withstand\r\nsummary judgment.6 Accordingly, the issue of actual agency is a question for the\r\njury. See Gathers, 282 S.C. at 226, 317 S.E.2d at 752 (\"If there are any facts\r\ntending to prove the relationship of agency, it then becomes a question for the\r\njury.\" (emphasis added)); Fernander, 278 S.C. at 142, 293 S.E.2d at 425\r\n(\"[Q]uestions of agency ordinarily should not be resolved by summary judgment\r\nwhere there are any facts giving rise to an inference of an agency relationship.\"\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we do not suggest that the Fronebergers have\r\npresented sufficient evidence to establish an agency relationship at trial.\r\nUltimately, evidence may demonstrate that Euro and Mr. Smith never entered into\r\nan agency relationship. However, given the minimal amount of discovery the\r\nparties had conducted at the time summary judgment was granted,7 we find the\r\nSmiths' answers created a mere scintilla of evidence that precluded summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nUtilizing the mere scintilla of evidence burden, the inconsistencies among the\r\nSmiths' answers create a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Additionally, the instant case is distinguishable from the case law cited by the\r\ndissent. The admissions in the Smiths' answers were before the circuit court as\r\npleadings of Euro's co-defendants, and not in the pleadings of the party resisting\r\nsummary judgment. Cf. Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 516-17, 445 S.E.2d 651,\r\n655 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding an affidavit submitted by the party resisting summary\r\njudgment that contained a \"conclusory statement as to the ultimate issue in [that]\r\ncase [was] not sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact for purposes of resisting\r\nsummary judgment\"). We also note that the only evidence that conflicts with the\r\nadmissions in the Smiths' pleadings is a similar conclusory statement in the\r\naffidavit from Euro's president stating that Euro never employed Mr. Smith or\r\nauthorized him to hold himself out as its agent.\r\n7The record indicates that at the time summary judgment was granted, the only\r\ndiscovery before the circuit court was the Fronebergers' depositions and the\r\naffidavit of Euro's president.\r\n\njudgment.8 Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in concluding that the\r\nFronebergers could not proceed under a theory of actual agency.\r\n\r\nC. Mrs. Smith's Scope of Employment\r\n\r\nThe Fronebergers also contend that the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\njudgment based upon its finding that the actions of Mrs. Smith in furtherance of\r\nher husband's investment scheme were outside the scope of her employment with\r\nEuro.\r\n\r\n\"The modern doctrine of respondeat superior makes a master liable to a third party\r\nfor injuries caused by the tort of his servant committed within the scope of the\r\nservant's employment.\" S.C. Ins. Co. v. James C. Greene & Co., 290 S.C. 171,\r\n179, 348 S.E.2d 617, 621 (Ct. App. 1986). \"An act falls within the scope of the\r\nservant's employment if it was reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of\r\nthe servant's employment, and it was done in furtherance of the master's business.\"\r\nWade v. Berkeley Cnty., 330 S.C. 311, 319, 498 S.E.2d 684, 688 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nAccordingly, \"the master is liable for the torts of his servant even when the servant\r\nacts against the express instructions of his master, so long as the servant acts to\r\nfurther the master's business.\" Id. \"What is within the scope of employment may\r\nbe determined by implication from the circumstances of the case.\" Id. \"Any doubt\r\nas to whether the servant was acting within the scope of his authority when he\r\ninjured a third person must be resolved against the master, at least to the extent of\r\nrequiring that the question be submitted to the jury.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the proper question for the circuit court was whether Mrs.\r\nSmith's acts facilitating her husband's investment scheme were: (1) in furtherance\r\nof Euro's business and (2) reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of her\r\nemployment. We believe that several of Mrs. Smith's actions, particularly\r\nallowing her husband access to Euro's office and signing the loan application that\r\nwas submitted to Euro's underwriting office, served to further her master's business\r\n\r\n8 We recognize that one of the Fronebergers' causes of action is fraud, which\r\nrequires a heightened standard of proof at the summary judgment stage. See\r\nTurner, 392 S.C. at 125, 708 S.E.2d at 770 (finding that \"more than a mere scintilla\r\nof evidence must be presented to withstand a motion for summary judgment\" when\r\nfraud is the cause of action). However, because the circuit court's summary\r\njudgment order focused solely on the existence of agency and did not address the\r\nmerits of the underlying fraud claim, we find it appropriate to apply the mere\r\nscintilla burden to the agency question for all causes of action.\r\n\nof lending money and obtaining mortgages and were reasonably necessary to\r\naccomplish the purpose of her employment. These actions were also integral in\r\nfacilitating the transaction between the Fronebergers and her husband.\r\n\r\nThe dissent argues that the circuit court properly held that the Fronebergers'\r\ndamages arose solely from the investment transactions with Mr. Smith and were\r\nunconnected to the mortgage loan from Euro. However, there is evidence in the\r\nrecord that shows these two transactions were closely related. The Fronebergers'\r\ntestified at their depositions that their sole purpose in obtaining this mortgage was\r\nto fund the investment plan provided by Mr. Smith. This contention is supported\r\nby the fact that their prior mortgage with Wells Fargo only had a remaining\r\nbalance of $1,086.43 at the time they closed on the mortgage. Accordingly, we\r\nfind the circuit court inappropriately concluded that Mr. Smith's investment\r\nscheme and the mortgage loan from Euro were separate and unrelated. Instead,\r\nunder Wade, we find this determination was a question for the jury. 330 S.C. at\r\n319, 498 S.E.2d at 688 (\"Any doubt as to whether the servant was acting within the\r\nscope of his authority when he injured a third person must be resolved against the\r\nmaster, at least to the extent of requiring that the question be submitted to the\r\njury.\").\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find that there are genuine questions of material fact\r\nregarding whether the actions of Mrs. Smith were within the scope of her\r\nemployment that are sufficient to withstand summary judgment. See Hancock, 381\r\nS.C. at 330, 673 S.E.2d at 803 (requiring only \"a mere scintilla of evidence\" to\r\nwithstand summary judgment in cases applying the preponderance of the evidence\r\nburden of proof); Wade, 330 S.C. at 319, 498 S.E.2d at 688 (\"Any doubt as to\r\nwhether the servant was acting within the scope of his authority when he injured a\r\nthird person must be resolved against the master, at least to the extent of requiring\r\nthat the question be submitted to the jury.\"). Therefore, we find that the circuit\r\ncourt erred in granting summary judgment.\r\n\r\nDue to the circuit court's errors regarding the grant of summary judgment on the\r\nexistence of an actual agency with Mr. Smith and the scope of Mrs. Smith's\r\nemployment, we reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment on the\r\nFronebergers' causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion,\r\nand breach of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.\r\n\r\nII. Negligent Hiring and Consumer Protection Code Claims\r\n\nThe Fronebergers additionally argue that the circuit court improperly dismissed\r\ntheir causes of action for (1) negligent hiring and retention and (2) rescission based\r\nupon unconscionability under Section 37-10-105 the South Carolina Code (2002)\r\n(the \"Consumer Protection Code\") because the circuit court provided no reasoning\r\nfor dismissing these claims. Furthermore, because these causes of action are\r\nseparate and distinct from agency, the Fronebergers contend that the court's ruling\r\non agency was not dispositive on the viability of their negligent hiring and\r\nConsumer Protection Code claims. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"[A circuit] court's order on summary judgment must set out facts and\r\naccompanying legal analysis sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review.\"\r\nBowen v. Lee Process Sys. Co., 342 S.C. 232, 237, 536 S.E.2d 86, 88 (Ct. App.\r\n2000). \"Such an order must include those facts which the circuit court finds\r\nrelevant, determinative of the issues and undisputed.\" Id. at 237-38, 536 S.E.2d at\r\n88-89 (internal quotation marks omitted). The order should also \"provide clear\r\nnotice to all parties and the reviewing court as to the rationale applied in granting .\r\n. . summary judgment.\" Id. at 38, 536 S.E.2d at 89 (alteration in original) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn this case, Euro moved for summary judgment on all of the Fronebergers' causes\r\nof action. However, their memorandum in support of summary judgment focuses\r\non the nonexistence of an agency relationship between Mr. Smith and Euro. At the\r\nhearing for this motion, the Fronebergers argued to the circuit court that at least\r\none of their causes of actions did not depend on the finding of an agency\r\nrelationship.9 The circuit court's order granting summary judgment on six of the\r\nseven causes of action brought by the Fronebergers does not contain specific\r\nfindings or reasoning for the dismissal of any particular cause of action. Instead,\r\nthe order, under a section entitled \"Discussion,\" generally finds that there was no\r\nagency relationship between Mr. Smith and Euro and that the Fronebergers' losses\r\narose solely from their loans to Mr. Smith and were unrelated to their mortgage\r\ntransaction with Euro. With their motion for reconsideration, the Fronebergers\r\nargued that the order failed to address all of their causes of action, specifically\r\npointing out the negligent hiring and consumer protection code claims. The circuit\r\ncourt denied the motion for reconsideration in a Form 4 order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9Counsel for the Fronebergers stated: \"There is one other, your honor, . . . that's\r\nnot affected by agency or apparent agency and that's the negligent hiring and\r\nretention.\"\r\n\nWe find the circuit court has failed to provide adequate reasoning for its grant of\r\nsummary judgment as to the Fronebergers' claims for negligent hiring and\r\nrescission. See Bowen, 342 S.C. at 237, 536 S.E.2d at 88 (stating that the circuit\r\ncourt \"must set out facts and accompanying legal analysis\" to support its grant for\r\nsummary judgment). The circuit court did not discuss either the undisputed\r\nmaterial facts or applicable law which support its grant of summary judgment in\r\nrelation to Mrs. Smith's hiring and retention or the alleged unconscionable\r\ninducement regarding their loan. Neither of these claims turn on the existence of\r\nan agency relationship between Mr. Smith and Euro. The circuit court failed to\r\nprovide either further findings of fact relating to these claims or more defined\r\nrationale explaining the grant of summary judgment. We therefore vacate the\r\ncircuit court's grant of summary judgment for the Fronebergers' claims for\r\nnegligent hiring and violation of the Consumer Protection Code and remand the\r\nmatter to the circuit court for an order \"identifying the facts and accompanying\r\nlegal analysis on which it relied in granting Defendants' summary judgment\r\nmotion\" as to these two causes of action.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Fronebergers have presented at least a mere scintilla of evidence that there was\r\nan actual agency relationship between Mr. Smith and Euro. Further, there are\r\ngenuine questions of fact regarding whether the actions of Mrs. Smith were within\r\nthe scope of her employment. Hence, the grant of summary judgment based on the\r\ncourt's findings that there was no agency relationship with Mr. Smith and that the\r\nacts of Mrs. Smith were outside the scope of her employment was improper.\r\nAdditionally, the circuit court failed to provide adequate reasoning for its dismissal\r\nof the Fronebergers' claims for negligent hiring and rescission under the Consumer\r\nProtection Code. Therefore, we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the\r\nFronebergers' causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion,\r\nand breach of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. Further, we vacate\r\nthe circuit court's grant of summary judgment for the Fronebergers' claims for\r\nnegligent hiring and violation of the Consumer Protection Code and remand the\r\nmatter to the circuit court for an order identifying the facts and accompanying legal\r\nanalysis on which it relied in granting Euro's motion for summary judgment as to\r\nthese two causes of action.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's order is\r\n\r\nREVERSED IN PART and VACATED IN PART and REMANDED.\r\n\nPIEPER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., dissenting: Kirkland and Janel Smith fraudulently and tortiously\r\nmisappropriated the Fronebergers' retirement funds. There is no evidence in this\r\nrecord, however, that in doing so either of them acted as an agent of Euro\r\nMortgage Bankers, Inc. Therefore, I would affirm the circuit court's order granting\r\nsummary judgment to Euro.\r\n\r\n      A.     Apparent Authority\r\n\r\nThe majority correctly concludes there is no evidence of agency through apparent\r\nauthority. In reaching this correct conclusion, however, the majority has confused\r\nthe elements of apparent authority and has misstated the first element.\r\n\r\n\"The basis of apparent authority is representations made by the principal to the\r\nthird party and reliance by the third party on those representations.\" Young v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Disabilities & Special Needs, 374 S.C. 360, 367, 649 S.E.2d 488, 491\r\n(2007). To analyze the existence of apparent authority, a court must focus on \"the\r\nrelationship between . . . the principal and the third party.\" Charleston, S.C.\r\nRegistry for Golf & Tourism, Inc. v. Young Clement Rivers & Tisdale, LLP, 359\r\nS.C. 635, 642-43, 598 S.E.2d 717, 721 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\n             Based upon these general principles, our courts have\r\n             required three elements be proven to establish apparent\r\n             authority: \"(1) that the purported principal consciously or\r\n             impliedly represented another to be his agent; (2) that\r\n             there was a reliance upon the representation; and (3) that\r\n             there was a change of position to the relying party's\r\n             detriment.\"\r\n\r\n359 S.C. at 643, 598 S.E.2d at 721 (quoting Graves v. Serbin Farms, Inc., 306 S.C.\r\n60, 63, 409 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1991)); see also Simmons v. Tuomey Reg'l. Med. Ctr.,\r\n341 S.C. 32, 46, 533 S.E.2d 312, 319 (2000) (listing the three elements).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the circuit court correctly focused on the relationship between the\r\nprincipal and the third party and determined that because there was no evidence\r\nEuro made any representation to the Fronebergers, they failed to satisfy the first\r\nelement of apparent authority. The majority, however, has incorrectly analyzed the\r\ncircuit court's ruling by repeating language our courts have used to explain and\r\nanalyze the second element. The majority has used that language as support for its\r\n\nincorrect conclusions that \"inaction could serve as conduct,\" and thus that the first\r\nelement can be satisfied by evidence of \"conscious and voluntary inaction\" or that\r\n\"the principal . . . passively permit[ed] another to appear to third parties to have\r\nauthority to act on his behalf.\" The majority is incorrect because the first element\r\ncannot be satisfied by inaction. Rather, to survive a motion for summary judgment\r\nas to the first element of apparent authority, the plaintiff must produce evidence of\r\nsome action by the purported principal through which the principal represented to\r\nthe third party that the alleged agent had authority to act on the principal's behalf.\r\n\r\nThe majority cites Watkins v. Mobil Oil Corporation, 291 S.C. 62, 352 S.E.2d 284\r\n(Ct. App. 1986), in support of its argument that the first element can be proven by\r\n\"conscious and voluntary inaction\" by Euro. For two reasons, I believe the\r\nmajority incorrectly relies on Watkins. First, Watkins specifically states that\r\napparent authority cannot be proven by \"conscious and voluntary inaction.\" 291\r\nS.C. at 67, 352 S.E.2d at 287 (stating \"it is not enough simply to prove . . .\r\nconscious and voluntary inaction\"). Second, Watkins relates only to the second\r\nelement of apparent authority, not the first. In framing our explanation that no\r\nevidence of apparent authority existed, we limited the discussion to the second\r\nelement, specifically stating, \"only the factor of reliance warrants discussion . . . .\"\r\nId. Because Watkins specifically states apparent authority cannot be proven by\r\ninaction, and because the analysis in Watkins relates only to the second element of\r\napparent authority, the majority's reliance on Watkins is misplaced.\r\n\r\nI believe the majority has incorrectly interpreted the word \"impliedly.\" In\r\nnumerous cases, our courts have stated the first element may be satisfied by\r\nevidence showing \"the purported principal . . . impliedly represented another to be\r\nhis agent.\" See, e.g., Charleston, S.C. Registry for Golf & Tourism, Inc., 359 S.C.\r\nat 643, 598 S.E.2d at 721 (quoting Graves, 306 S.C. at 63, 409 S.E.2d at 771); see\r\nalso Simmons, 341 S.C. at 46, 533 S.E.2d at 319 (stating \"the injured patient must\r\nestablish that [] the hospital consciously or impliedly represented the physician to\r\nbe its agent\"). By using the word \"impliedly,\" however, our courts did not intend\r\nto allow proof of the first element by inaction. Rather, our courts used the word\r\nimpliedly to indicate that a principal who made no express representation of\r\nauthority, but who took action that amounts to an implicit representation of\r\nauthority, may still be held vicariously liable under the doctrine of apparent\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe majority relies on cases such as R & G Construction, Inc. v. Lowcountry\r\nRegional Transportation Authority, 343 S.C. 424, 540 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe language the majority relies on, however, relates only to the second element of\r\n\napparent authority. In R & G Construction, this court explained that reliance under\r\nthe second element must be reasonable. 343 S.C. at 433, 540 S.E.2d at 118 (stating\r\n\"[t]he elements of apparent agency are: . . . (2) third party reasonably relied on the\r\nrepresentation . . . \" (emphasis added)). Because the court's focus must be on the\r\nrelationship between the principal and the third party, a proper evaluation of the\r\nreasonableness of the third party's reliance also focuses on that relationship. A\r\ncourt must ask whether \"third persons are justified in believing the agent is acting\r\nwithin his authority\" based on the \"conduct or other manifestations of the\r\nprincipal's consent.\" 343 S.C. at 434, 540 S.E.2d at 118 (citing Genovese v.\r\nBergeron, 327 S.C. 567, 572, 490 S.E.2d 608, 611 (Ct. App. 1997)). In this\r\ncontext, we further explained the second element, and particularly how a court may\r\ndetermine whether the third party's reliance is reasonable, stating, \"Such authority\r\nis implied where the principal passively permits the agent to appear to a third\r\nperson to have the authority to act on his behalf.\" Id. (citing Genovese, 327 S.C. at\r\n572, 490 S.E.2d at 611).\r\n\r\nGenovese demonstrates that this \"passively permits\" language relates to the second\r\nelement of apparent authority, not the first. In Genovese, the issue was whether the\r\nlandlord's employee had authority to inform the tenant she could vacate the leased\r\nproperty without further obligation under the lease. 327 S.C. at 570, 490 S.E.2d at\r\n610. We stated, \"It is undisputed that [the employee] was the landlords' agent,\"\r\nand proceeded to consider the \"extent of [the employee's] agency\" under the\r\ndoctrine of apparent authority. 327 S.C. at 571, 490 S.E.2d at 610. After reciting\r\nevidence supporting the existence of the first element, id., we discussed the\r\ndispositive issue—whether the evidence satisfied the second element. We\r\nconcluded the discussion of apparent authority by holding:\r\n\r\n             [W]e find there is some evidence in the record . . . that . .\r\n             . the conduct of the landlords in clothing [the employee]\r\n             with so much authority to manage the property would\r\n             allow a reasonably prudent person in the tenant's position\r\n             to believe [the employee] had the authority to release the\r\n             tenant from her obligations under the lease.\r\n\r\n327 S.C. at 572, 490 S.E.2d at 611. Because Genovese was decided based on the\r\nsecond element of apparent authority, not the first, the statements quoted from R &\r\nG Construction that cite Genovese for authority are correctly understood to relate\r\nto the second element.\r\n\nThe majority has also quoted other opinion excerpts that relate to analysis of the\r\nsecond element, and thus have no place in a discussion of a trial court's ruling on\r\nthe first element. For example, the majority correctly quotes Frasier v. Palmetto\r\nHomes of Florence, Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 244-45, 473 S.E.2d 865, 868 (Ct. App.\r\n1996) for the test for analyzing the first element of apparent authority—\"Apparent\r\nauthority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or\r\nany other conduct of the principal . . .\"—but in continuing the quotation, the\r\nmajority enters into the test for the second element—\"which, reasonably\r\ninterpreted, causes the third person to believe the principal consents to have the act\r\ndone on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.\" The majority further\r\nquotes Frasier, stating, \"the principal must intend to cause the third person to\r\nbelieve that the agent is authorized to act for him, or he should realize that his\r\nconduct is likely to create such belief.\" Id. The majority has also quoted language\r\nfrom R & G Construction, 343 S.C. at 433, 540 S.E.2d at 118, to the effect that\r\napparent authority may be established when a principal \"has knowingly . . .\r\npermitted another to appear to be his agent,\" and the following language from\r\nFernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 143, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982), \"agency\r\nmay be . . . proved by the conduct of the purported agent exhibiting a pretense of\r\nauthority with the knowledge of the alleged principal.\" These are correct\r\nstatements of law when considered in relation to the second element, but these\r\nstatements are misplaced in a discussion of the first element.\r\n\r\nThus, the majority's analysis of whether the Fronebergers were reasonably justified\r\nin believing Mr. Smith was an agent of Euro and whether Euro knew Mr. Smith\r\nwas holding himself out as Euro's agent is also misplaced in a discussion of the\r\nfirst element. Further, the majority's contention that the Fronebergers could prove\r\nthe first element simply by \"demonstrat[ing] Euro knowingly permitted Mr. Smith\r\nto appear to others to be his agent,\" and its conclusion, \"Without knowledge of Mr.\r\nSmith's conduct, Euro cannot have permitted this behavior with conscious\r\ninaction,\" are incorrect. The only issue before this court regarding apparent\r\nauthority is whether the circuit court correctly found no evidence of the first\r\nelement. To the extent the majority opinion suggests that the first element could be\r\nsatisfied by anything other than evidence of action taken by Euro, the majority\r\nopinion is incorrect.10 Analyzing the first element of apparent authority, the law\r\nrequires a court to focus on the actions of the purported principal—not the inaction\r\n\r\n10The majority's statements that the first element may be proven by inaction, or by\r\nanything other than evidence of action taken by Euro, are also dicta because they\r\nare not necessary to the resolution of this appeal.\r\n\nof the principal, not the actions of the alleged agent, and not what the third party\r\nmight have inferred from the agent's actions. In this case, the Fronebergers\r\nproduced no evidence of any action by Euro, and the circuit court correctly granted\r\nsummary judgment on the basis of their failure to satisfy the first element.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to suggest that a purported principal's \"inaction\" is irrelevant to the\r\nfirst element from an evidentiary standpoint. In some cases, certain inaction may\r\nassist the factfinder in understanding the significance of the purported principal's\r\naction. Thus, inaction may be relevant and admissible under Rules 401 and 402,\r\nSCRE. The majority asserts that if Euro knew Mr. Smith held himself out as\r\nEuro's Charlotte branch manager, used Euro's office space, and handed out\r\nbusiness cards with Euro's logo on them, Euro could be liable if it did nothing to\r\nstop Mr. Smith. It is true that evidence of Euro's inaction in the face of this\r\nconduct is relevant, and, if the Fronebergers had offered evidence of action taken\r\nby Euro, would be admissible at trial. None of that evidence, however, satisfies\r\nthe first element of apparent authority on a motion for summary judgment. Rather,\r\nthe Fronebergers must offer evidence that Euro took some action amounting to an\r\nexpress or implied representation to them that Mr. Smith had authority to act as\r\nEuro's agent. There is no such evidence in this case, and thus the circuit court\r\ncorrectly granted summary judgment as to the first element of apparent authority.\r\n\r\n      B.     Actual Authority\r\n\r\nThe majority incorrectly concludes there is evidence of agency through actual\r\nauthority. Actual authority is based on the relationship between the purported\r\nprincipal and agent. See Richardson v. P.V., Inc., 383 S.C. 610, 615, 682 S.E.2d\r\n263, 265 (2009) (defining actual authority as authority that is \"expressly conferred\r\nupon the agent by the principal\"). For agency to exist through actual authority, the\r\nprincipal must consent to and intend for the agent to act on his behalf, and\r\nlikewise, the agent must accept the authority to act on behalf of the principal. See\r\nRestatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 (2006) (explaining agency arises when the\r\nprincipal consents \"that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to\r\nthe principal's control,\" and the agent consents to act on the principal's behalf);\r\nPeoples Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Myrtle Beach Golf & Yacht Club, 310 S.C. 132,\r\n145, 425 S.E.2d 764, 773 (Ct. App. 1992) (\"Agency . . . results from the\r\nmanifestation of consent by one person to another to be subject to the control of the\r\nother and to act on his behalf.\"). The test to determine whether an agency\r\nrelationship exists is whether the purported principal has the right to control the\r\nconduct of the alleged agent in the performance of his work and the manner in\r\nwhich the work is to be done. Jamison v. Morris, 385 S.C. 215, 222, 684 S.E.2d\r\n\n168, 171 (2009); Newell v. Trident Med. Ctr., 359 S.C. 4, 12, 597 S.E.2d 776, 780\r\n(2004). Thus, an agency relationship based on actual authority exists when a\r\npurported principal and an alleged agent mutually consent to the principal\r\ncontrolling the agent in the work the agent has agreed to do on the principal's\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nApplying the law to the facts of this case, we must affirm the circuit court unless\r\nthe Fronebergers offered evidence of a relationship between Euro and Mr. Smith\r\nthat meets this test for actual authority. To determine whether this evidence exists,\r\ncourts examine the relationship between the purported principal and the alleged\r\nagent. In Newell, for example, the court focused on the language of the hospital's\r\nbylaws in concluding no actual agency relationship existed between the hospital\r\nand a non-employee physician at the hospital. 359 S.C. at 14, 597 S.E.2d at 781.\r\nSimilarly, the court in Jamison looked at the documents governing the parties'\r\nrelationship to determine whether the purported principal had the right to control\r\nthe alleged agent in its performance of alcoholic beverage sales. 385 S.C. at 222-\r\n23, 684 S.E.2d at 171-72. Here, there is no evidence of any relationship between\r\nEuro and Mr. Smith. Therefore, there can be no evidence that Euro and Mr. Smith\r\nmutually consented to Euro controlling him, and there is no evidence of agency\r\nthrough actual authority.\r\n\r\nThe majority argues the Smiths' answers are evidence of actual authority. Unless\r\nthe answer is verified, or unless it is the moving party's own answer, it is not\r\nevidence that can be considered on summary judgment. The point is proven by the\r\nopinion the majority cites for the standard to be applied to a summary judgment\r\nmotion—Miller v. Blumenthal Mills, Inc., 365 S.C. 204, 616 S.E.2d 722 (Ct. App.\r\n2005). The majority omits from its quotation from Miller the key language\r\napplicable to this case—\"the opponent [of summary judgment] cannot simply rest\r\non mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.\" 365 S.C. at 220, 616\r\nS.E.2d at 730.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Smiths' answers do not suffice because they contain only the bare\r\nconclusion that Mr. Smith was an agent, with no evidence to support the\r\nconclusion. See Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 516-17, 445 S.E.2d 651, 655 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1994) (stating a \"conclusory statement as to the ultimate issue in a case is not\r\nsufficient to create a genuine issue of fact for purposes of resisting summary\r\njudgment\"). The Smiths' answers contain no evidence of any action by Euro.\r\nThus, there is no evidence that Euro consented to Mr. Smith acting on its behalf\r\nand under its control. It makes no difference that the answers were filed by Euro's\r\nco-defendants. The answers contain no basis for a factfinder to infer that Euro and\r\n\nMr. Smith mutually consented to a relationship through which Euro had the\r\nauthority to control Mr. Smith's conduct. The majority actually defeats its own\r\nargument by observing in its section on apparent authority that there is no evidence\r\n\"indicating Euro knew Mr. Smith was acting\" on Euro's behalf. I would affirm the\r\ncircuit court's order granting summary judgment to Euro.\r\n\r\nThe majority's reliance on the \"minimal amount of discovery\" conducted before the\r\nsummary judgment hearing is also misplaced. By including the reference to\r\ndiscovery, the majority suggests the existence or non-existence of evidence\r\nsufficient to overcome a summary judgment motion depends on the extent to\r\nwhich additional discovery could be conducted. However, whether the party\r\nopposing a summary judgment motion has had a full opportunity to complete\r\ndiscovery is a separate legal issue than whether that party met its burden to\r\nproduce sufficient evidence. The Fronebergers did not move for a continuance of\r\nthe summary judgment hearing to pursue further discovery and did not argue at the\r\nsummary judgment hearing or in their appellate brief they were afforded\r\nincomplete discovery. See Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433,\r\n439 (2003) (stating in order to delay a summary judgment ruling, \"the nonmoving\r\nparty must demonstrate the likelihood that further discovery will uncover\r\nadditional relevant evidence\"); Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114,\r\n118, 420 S.E.2d 495, 497 (1992) (refusing to consider whether \"summary\r\njudgment was premature because . . . discovery [was] outstanding\" when\r\nappellants \"took no steps to protect their interests in this regard\"); Bayle v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 128, 542 S.E.2d 736, 742 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding\r\nincomplete discovery issue unpreserved because appellant did not \"move for a\r\ncontinuance in which to pursue further discovery\"). If the need for more discovery\r\nwas an issue, the Fronebergers should have requested it. Once the summary\r\njudgment question is before the court, the sole question is whether the evidence\r\ncreates a question of fact for the jury.\r\n\r\n      C.     Scope of Employment\r\n\r\nLikewise, I would affirm the circuit court's finding that Mrs. Smith's actions were\r\nnot within the scope of her employment. For the purposes of determining whether\r\nthe doctrine of respondeat superior applies, an employee's tortious act is within the\r\nscope of his or her employment when it is \"reasonably necessary to accomplish the\r\npurpose of his [or her] employment and in furtherance of the master's business.\"\r\nArmstrong v. Food Lion, Inc., 371 S.C. 271, 276, 639 S.E.2d 50, 52 (2006)\r\n(emphasis added). This test requires the employee's actions be (1) tortious, (2)\r\nreasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the employment, and (3) in\r\n\nfurtherance of the employer's business, before the actions may subject the principal\r\nto liability.\r\n\r\nThus, the only actions that are pertinent to determining whether Euro is liable\r\nunder the doctrine of respondeat superior are those that were tortious. See James\r\nv. Kelly Trucking Co., 377 S.C. 628, 631, 661 S.E.2d 329, 330 (2008) (\"The\r\ndoctrine of respondeat superior provides that the employer . . . is called to answer\r\nfor the tortious acts of . . . the employee, when those acts occur in the course and\r\nscope of the employee's employment.\" (emphasis added)). In this case, Mrs.\r\nSmith's only tortious actions were those related to the investment transaction. Her\r\nact of signing the mortgage loan resulted only in Euro transferring $127,647 to the\r\nFronebergers, which caused them no harm. The Fronebergers suffered no injury\r\nuntil they gave Mr. Smith money, and it was the investment transaction that caused\r\ntheir harm. When we consider just the investment transaction, there is no evidence\r\nthat Mrs. Smith's act of allowing her husband to use her office to provide\r\ninvestment advice was within the scope of her employment. Euro's business is\r\nmortgage lending. Euro does not provide investment advice, nor does it broker\r\ninvestments. Therefore, Mrs. Smith's actions that relate to the investment\r\ntransaction were not reasonably necessary to accomplish Euro's business of\r\nmortgage lending and did not further Euro's business.\r\n\r\nThe majority argues, however, that Mrs. Smith's actions to obtain the mortgage\r\nloan were within the scope of her employment, and subject Euro to liability,\r\nbecause those actions were \"integral in facilitating the [investment] transaction\r\nbetween the Fronebergers and [Mr. Smith].\" It is true that the fraud on the\r\nFronebergers could not have been perpetrated but for the loan from Euro.\r\nHowever, the Fronebergers' theory of Euro's liability depends on Mr. Smith and\r\nMrs. Smith acting intentionally, not merely negligently,11 to misappropriate their\r\nretirement funds. Therefore, to the extent Mrs. Smith's actions in obtaining the\r\nloan were part of her husband's fraud, she was necessarily acting to enable him to\r\nmisappropriate the Fronebergers' money. Under the majority's theory, therefore,\r\nshe was not acting in furtherance of Euro's business, but defrauding Euro by\r\n\r\n11 The Fronebergers' causes of action against Euro relevant to this appeal are fraud\r\nand conversion—both of which require proof of intentional conduct—and\r\nnegligence. However, Euro cannot be liable for negligence because neither Euro\r\nnor Mrs. Smith owed the Fronebergers a duty of due care regarding investment of\r\nthe proceeds of the loan. Therefore, the Fronebergers can recover from Euro only\r\nif they prove Mrs. Smith intentionally participated, within the scope of her\r\nemployment, in her husband's fraudulent scheme.\r\n\nexposing it to a loan whose proceeds she intended to help her husband steal. By\r\nparticipating in the theft of the proceeds of the loan, as the majority theorizes, she\r\nwas depriving Euro of a substantial component of its security. This was not \"in\r\nfurtherance\" of Euro's business but, instead, made Euro a victim of fraud. It is\r\nsimply not possible to hold Euro liable for civil damages by using its role as victim\r\nas evidence that the perpetrator of the fraud acted as its agent.\r\n\r\nThe majority asserts the circuit court erred in concluding the mortgage and\r\ninvestment loan transactions were separate and unrelated because that\r\ndetermination was a question for the jury. I disagree because the evidence in the\r\nrecord conclusively demonstrates the two transactions were independent. The\r\nFronebergers retained control over the loaned money because Euro never restricted\r\nhow the Fronebergers could spend it, which is demonstrated by the fact that the\r\nFronebergers spent approximately $5,000 of the loan proceeds on personal\r\nexpenses. Also, the Fronebergers received the mortgage loan after they first\r\nentrusted their money to Mr. Smith. Finally, there is no evidence the Fronebergers\r\nwere obligated to give Mr. Smith any of the loaned money they received. Thus,\r\nthe two transactions were distinct, and the circuit court correctly found the loans\r\n\"were independent transactions, unconnected with their mortgage loan with Euro.\"\r\n\r\n      D.     Conclusion\r\n\r\nI deeply sympathize with the Fronebergers for the loss of their retirement money.\r\nThe law, however, does not allow a remedy for every wrong. Here, their loss was\r\nexclusively the result of Mr. Smith's fraudulent investment scheme, not Euro's\r\nmortgage loan. Accordingly, I believe the circuit court properly granted summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
