Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  Timothy Terreal Kinard appeals his conviction for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  Kinard alleges the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the general intent required to convict for ABIK.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 13, 2000, Kinard and his brother, Reginald Davis, entered the home of seventy-six-year-old Hubert Bryan.Â  Kinard claimed he and Davis entered the house through an unlocked door and found Bryan present at his home, but Bryan contended he discovered Davis in his home after he had unlocked the door and entered.Â  Bryan suspected the men entered the home through a window they had pried open.Â  It is undisputed that Bryan drew a handgun and confronted Davis while Kinard remained out of sight.Â  Bryan demanded Davis leave and Davis complied.Â  After Davis left, Kinard came running out of the kitchen, struck Bryan in the head with an iron, and left the home.Â  Bryan sustained an injury to his head which required thirteen stitches, and when he returned from the hospital, he noticed $2,500.00 missing from his home.Â  Kinard and Davis fled to New York, but were later arrested and returned to South Carolina.Â  Â \r\n \r\nA Saluda County grand jury indicted Kinard for first degree burglary and assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  At trial, the jury convicted Kinard of both charges, and the trial court sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment for burglary and fifteen years imprisonment for ABIK to be served concurrently.[1]Â  Â Kinard appeals.[2]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  â€œAn appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, 159, 634 S.E.2d 23, 26 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Generally, the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472 (2004). Â Â A charge to the jury is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when read as a whole.Â  Id. at 665, 594 S.E.2d at 472-73.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKinard contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the general intent required to convict for ABIK.Â  We disagree.\r\nABIK is defined as an unlawful act of a violent nature to the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied.Â  State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 275, 584 S.E.2d 138, 141 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Murder is the killing of a person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.Â  Id.&nbsp; \r\nWith the exception of the death of the victim, each and every element of murder must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order for a jury to convict a defendant of ABIK.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œMalice aforethoughtâ€ is defined as â€œthe requisite mental state for common-law murderâ€ and it utilizes four possible mental states to encompass both specific and general intent to commit the crime.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 969 (7th ed. 1999).Â  These four possibilities are intent to kill, intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, extremely reckless indifference to the value of human life (abandoned and malignant heart), and intent to commit a felony (felony murder rule).[3]Â  Id.Â  â€œGeneral intentâ€ is defined as â€œthe state of mind required for the commission of certain common law crimes not requiring specific intentâ€ and it â€œusually takes the form of recklessness . . . or negligence.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 813 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Â \r\nClearly, the above definitions illustrate that malice aforethought encompasses both the specific and general intent to commit murder.Â  As ABIK encompasses each of the required elements of murder except for the death of the victim, it is axiomatic that malice aforethought be the mental state required to commit ABIK.Â  Further, the South Carolina Supreme Court has stated â€œthe required mental state for ABIK, like murder, is malice aforethought.â€Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 275, 531 S.E.2d 512, 517 (2000).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIn this matter the trial court instructed the jury thusly:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAssault and battery with intent to kill has 4 elements.Â  Itâ€™s an unlawful act of violent injury to the person of another accompanied with malice aforethought. â€¦Malice is an essential element of assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  The malice must be aforethought.Â  Thought of just before and at the time the blow was struck. â€¦ \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSo what do we mean by malice?Â  Malice imports wickedness, and it excludes any just cause or legal excuse.Â  Malice springs from depravity, from a depraved spirit, from a heart devoid of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.Â  It does not necessarily import ill will towards the specific person who is injured, but rather it signifies a general malignancy towards and recklessness for the life and safety of another or a condition of the mind that shows a heart devoid of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.Â  There has to be a combination between this evil intent existing aforethought, just before and at the commission of the battery, and the act producing the battery. . . .\r\n\t\tNow obviously, folks, malice is a state of mind.Â  The State has to prove to you that the element of malice existed by either direct evidence or circumstantial evidence or a combination of both.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn its charge, the court went on to explain that the jury could infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon and explained the difference between ABIK and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).Â  The court summed up the instructions and noted ABHAN, unlike ABIK, did not require malice aforethought.Â \r\n \r\nAt trial, defense counsel relied on State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996), in objecting to this instruction.Â  In Foust, the Supreme Court noted numerous prior cases which required intent to kill accompanied with malice in order to convict for ABIK.Â  Id. at 15, 479 S.E.2d at 51.Â  The Court acknowledged the requirement of â€œsomeâ€ intent, but clearly stated a specific intent to kill was not necessary.Â  Id.Â  The court held â€œit is sufficient if there is shown some general intent, such as that heretofore applied in cases of murder in this state,â€ and â€œaccordingly, . . . in charging juries the law of ABIK, South Carolina trial judges should give a standard â€˜intentâ€™ charge . . . .â€Â  Id. at 15-16, 479 S.E.2d at 51-52.Â  Defense counsel interpreted this holding to require a specific instruction regarding general intent to kill.Â  Defense counsel argued you could not convict someone of ABIK if you had malice but not intent to kill or if you had intent to kill without malice.Â  However, when counsel was asked the difference between a general intent to kill and malice aforethought, he replied â€œI donâ€™t know.â€Â Â \r\n \r\nWhile we are mindful of previous opinions from the appellate courts of this state which have treated intent to kill and malice as separate requirements, we, much like both parties and the trial judge below, fail to discern any significant difference between general intent to kill and malice aforethought as they pertain to ABIK.Â  Since the definition of malice aforethought encompasses general intent to kill, we find it difficult to reconcile a manner in which one could find malice aforethought and yet not find general intent to kill.Â  Further, we read the Foust opinion as the elimination of this artificial distinction.Â  In stating that some general intent such as that heretofore applied in murder cases in this state was sufficient to prove ABIK, the Foust court was establishing malice aforethought as the necessary general intent.Â  Since malice aforethought undoubtedly has been established as the intent required in murder cases, we necessarily arrive at the above conclusion.Â  Moreover, our state Supreme Court reaffirmed malice aforethought as the required mental state for ABIK in an opinion decided four years subsequent to Foust.Â  Fennell, 340 S.C. at 275, 531 S.E.2d at 517.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial courtâ€™s jury instruction, which properly charged the jury regarding malice aforethought, to be without error.Â  The jury was given a proper â€œintentâ€ charge.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error in the trial courtâ€™s jury instruction.Â  Based on the foregoing, Kinardâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs in result only.\r\nANDERSON, J.: (concurring in result only) Because I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority, but vote to affirm the learned circuit judge, I concur in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] Kinard does not appeal his conviction for first degree burglary.\r\n[2] Pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), Kinardâ€™s appellate counsel filed a brief along with a petition to be relieved, stating his examination of the record indicated the appeal was without merit.Â  Kinard filed a separate pro se response. Following our Anders review, this court ordered the parties to brief the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Whether the circuit court judge erred in not charging the jury on general intent for assault and battery with intent to kill?\r\n\r\n  This issue is now our sole appellate consideration.\r\n[3] We note the South Carolina Supreme Court has found the Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary definition of â€œmalice aforethoughtâ€ does not vary in a meaningful way from a proper jury instruction.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 64, 530 S.E.2d 626, 628 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4243","title":"Williamson v.

Williamson and Company (collectively, â€œWilliamsonâ€) appeal from the trial judgeâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees to Alfred C. Middleton.Â  Williamson argues that Middleton is not entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees, or in the alternative, that the criteria for awarding attorneysâ€™ fees were not met in this case.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nPrior to this litigation, Middleton worked for a number of years as a commissioned salesman for Williamson. When Middleton quit working for Williamson, he was due a commission for having sold pallets to one of Williamsonâ€™s customers.Â  Middleton and Williamson disagreed as to the amount of commission due to Middleton, and Williamson never paid Middleton any commission, even though it eventually admitted owing him $906.62.Â  \r\n \r\nMiddleton left his employment with Williamson to work for Peninsula Plastics, Inc., one of Williamsonâ€™s pallet suppliers.Â  While at his new job, Middleton continued to seek the commission Williamson owed him to no avail, and in the spring of 2001, he hired Mr. James C. Parham, a partner with the Wyche Burgess law firm.Â  Middleton and Parham were personal friends who had met years before when Middleton owned a sporting goods store that Parham frequently visited.Â  Â Â \r\nOn behalf of Middleton, Parham wrote to Williamson inquiring about the commission due.Â  When he received no response, Parham spoke with Williamsonâ€™s attorney, Bill Jordan, informing him that a complaint had already been drafted and that Middleton was ready to sue to recover the unpaid commission.Â  Jordan requested that Middleton refrain from acting on the drafted complaint until Jordan could speak with his client.Â  Parham agreed, and two days later, Jordan filed a complaint on behalf of Williamson against Middleton, alleging causes of action for fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. Middleton filed an answer, denying the allegations and counterclaiming for commissions owed and sanctions under the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  Middleton also requested attorneysâ€™ fees. Â Upon the initiation of litigation, Patricia Ravenhorst, an associate with the Wyche Burgess firm, assisted Parham in representing Middleton.\r\nWhile preparing for trial, Middleton had an extraordinarily difficult time collecting responses to its requests for discovery.Â  In Middletonâ€™s first set of interrogatories for Williamson, Middleton asked that Williamson â€œstate with particularity the facts alleged by [Williamson] to form the basis of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action.â€ Williamson provided no alleged facts and instead responded with a mere promise to â€œsupplement[] after further discovery and investigation.â€Â  A verbatim response was provided to Middletonâ€™s request for a statement of all damages sustained by Williamson. After receiving these unhelpful responses, Middletonâ€™s attorneys initiated several phone conversations and wrote a number of letters imploring Williamson to respond to their requests.Â Â  Â \r\nWhile Middleton waited for discovery responses during the ensuing months, Williamson filed a motion in October of 2001 seeking to amend its pleadings to add Peninsula Plastics and Middletonâ€™s supervisor at Peninsula Plastics as defendants and to add three more causes of action.Â  When the hearing on Williamsonâ€™s motion was just days away, it finally supplemented its responses to Middletonâ€™s discovery requests.Â  On November 17, 2001, Judge Henry Floyd denied Williamsonâ€™s motion to amend, finding it was not well founded, was not required by justice, and would be prejudicial to Middleton.Â  Less than one month later, Williamson filed a separate lawsuit against Middleton; this suit also named Peninsula Plastics and Middletonâ€™s supervisor as parties and included the very causes of action Williamson attempted to append to the initial complaint against Middleton.Â  Only after Middleton moved to dismiss this new lawsuit and sought attorneysâ€™ fees did Williamson voluntarily dismiss this second complaint.\r\n \r\nIn addition to Williamsonâ€™s race to the courthouse to be the first to file, its uncooperativeness when responding to discovery, and its attempt to circumvent Judge Floydâ€™s order, Williamson also cancelled depositions and mediation several times.Â  In at least one instance, the cancellation was communicated so late that Middleton and both of his attorneys were already at the mediatorâ€™s office when Williamsonâ€™s attorney called to cancel.Â  Approximately one month prior to trial, Williamsonâ€™s attorney moved to be relieved as counsel, and Williamson hired its current counsel. \r\n \r\nOf Williamsonâ€™s claims against Middleton, only its cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty went to the jury.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Middleton on that cause of action, and it also found in favor of Middleton on his counterclaim for unpaid commissions, awarding him $906.62 in actual damages.Â \r\n \r\nThe trial judge, Judge Pyle, found Middleton was entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees, but he asked the parties to attempt to determine the amount of attorneysâ€™ fees amongst themselves.Â  In the event the parties could not agree to an amount, Judge Pyle explained he would set the amount for them.Â  The parties could not come to a consensus on the amount of attorneysâ€™ fees, and Middleton petitioned the court for assistance.Â  A hearing was held before Judge Miller, who awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  On appeal, our court reversed this award of attorneysâ€™ fees, finding Judge Pyle retained exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.Â  We therefore reversed Judge Millerâ€™s award and remanded the issue of attorneysâ€™ fees for Judge Pyleâ€™s consideration.Â  See Williamson v. Middleton, 2005-UP-011 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 11, 2005).\r\nAt the hearing before Judge Pyle, Williamson argued Middleton was not entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees because he was not the prevailing party; the bill Middletonâ€™s counsel presented documenting over $100,000 worth of work listed hours spent on claims other than the unpaid commissions claim for which attorneysâ€™ fees are allowed; and the amount of fees Middletonâ€™s counsel requested, $35,000, far exceeded the $906.62 verdict. Williamson also argued Middleton did not actually incur any fees because when Parham was deposed, he admitted there was no written fee agreement between him and Middleton.Â \r\n \r\nJudge Pyle found Middleton was entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees because he prevailed in his action against Williamson for unpaid commissions pursuant to section 39-65-20 of the South Carolina Code. Â Judge Pyle found that in light of â€œthe detailed time statements, the affidavits of Middletonâ€™s counsel, and a review of the supporting memorandum and notebook of exhibits presented by Middletonâ€™s counsel, . . . the time and labor were reasonable, not duplicative and were required of Middletonâ€™s counsel in asserting his claim and overcoming the obstructions presented by [Williamson].â€ Judge Pyle also pointed out that although the detailed statements submitted by Middletonâ€™s counsel showed $106,992 in attorneysâ€™ fees, Middleton requested only a fraction of that amount.Â  With regard to contingency of compensation, Judge Pyle acknowledged that Middleton and his attorney had not entered into a formal, written fee agreement, but they relied instead â€œon their long-standing personal relationship and mutual agreement to determine an appropriate fee for services at the conclusion of this matter.â€ Judge Pyle found such an agreement did not preclude attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Finally, the judge noted that the fees were reasonable despite a verdict of only $906.62 because Williamson forced Middleton to file his counterclaim even though Williamson admitted he owed this amount at trial.Â  Judge Pyle explained: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tFailure to award Middleton reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees and costs incurred in this matter would encourage employers to discourage and obstruct legitimate claims by employees. . . .Â  Employers, such as [Williamson], with significant financial resources should not be permitted to systematically obstruct an employeeâ€™s efforts to recover unpaid commissions or other wages however small the sum might be.Â  Such a result would be especially egregious in the present case considering the fact that [Williamson] admit[s] owing Middleton these unpaid commissions before and during the course of this extended litigation, but consistently refused to pay him anything.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Judge Pyle awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Williamson filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe parties disagree as to the standard of review.Â  During oral argument, Williamson urged us to apply either an equitable standard of review pursuant to Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997), or an abuse of discretion standard of review pursuant to Russell v. Wachovia, 370 S.C. 5, 633 S.E.2d 722 (2006).[2]Â Â  In either event, Williamson argued we should not review the trial judgeâ€™s decision under an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Middleton agrees that an abuse of discretion standard should be applied, but that under such standard, an appellate court will affirm the trial judge so long as there is any competent evidence supporting the judgeâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n \r\nWe find the law well settled that the review of attorneyâ€™s fees awarded pursuant to statute is governed by an abuse of discretion standard.Â  See, e.g., Blumberg v. Nealco, 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993) (finding that a trial judgeâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion); Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990) (holding that when attorneyâ€™s fees are awarded pursuant to section 15-77-300 of the South Carolina Code, the appellate court reviews the award under an abuse of discretion standard); Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 358 S.C. 647, 649-52, 595 S.E.2d 890, 891 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œOn appeal, the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding attorneyâ€™s fees under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (Supp. 2003) will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€).Â  The law is equally clear that an appellate court will not reverse an award unless it is based on an error of law or is without any evidentiary support. Â See Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997) (â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when there is an error of law or a factual conclusion which is without evidentiary support.â€); Baron Data Sys. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384, 377 S.E.2d 296, 296 (1989) (â€œWhere an attorneyâ€™s services and their value are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€); Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987) (â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the judgeâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law or when based upon factual conclusion, is without evidentiary support.â€).Â  Accordingly, we will affirm the trial judgeâ€™s award of $35,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees if any competent evidence exists to support the award.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilliamson first argues Middleton is not entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees because he does not meet the requirements of section 39-65-30 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Specifically, Williamson points out that this statute only applies to sales representatives who seek to recover commissions on â€œwholesaleâ€ sales, and the sale Middleton seeks commissions from was made to the ultimate consumer.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nInitially, we note that Williamsonâ€™s arguments to Judge Pyle on this issue are not reflected in the record on appeal.Â  Williamson did not advance this argument at the hearing before Judge Pyle, and although Williamsonâ€™s counsel refers to a memorandum she filed in opposition to Middletonâ€™s request for attorneysâ€™ fees, that memorandum was not included in the record on appeal. Â See Taylor v. Taylor, 294 S.C. 296, 299, 363 S.E.2d 909, 911 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œThe burden is on the appellant to furnish a sufficient record on appeal from which this court can make an intelligent review.â€).Â  We acknowledge, however, that Judge Pyle addressed the argument in his order awarding attorneysâ€™ fees, suggesting the argument was set forth in Williamsonâ€™s memorandum.Â  In the order, Judge Pyle found Williamsonâ€™s argument that Middleton was not entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees and costs pursuant to section 39-65-30 came too late because during trial, Williamson never objected to the jury instructions referencing section 39-65-30, nor did Williamson challenge Judge Pyleâ€™s initial ruling that Middleton was entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Williamson did not seek a reconsideration of these findings by Judge Pyle in its Rule 59(e) motion.Â  \r\n \r\nIn its brief to our court, Williamson argues that â€œ[e]ven though the jury returned a verdict . . . that awarded Middleton $906.62 for unpaid commissions, this recovery was sought on alternate grounds, both pursuant to Â§ 39-56-30 and Â§ 41-10-10.â€Â  In so arguing, Williamson implies the juryâ€™s award was based on a statute other than section 39-56-30.Â  Williamson further contends that its argument on this issue is timely because â€œthe request for attorney fees is predicated on entirely different factors than was the request for commissions.â€Â  From the record before us, there is no indication this specific argument was ever made to the trial judge, either prior to the order awarding attorneysâ€™ fees or in Williamsonâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 5 n.6, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718 n.6 (1998) (â€œ[T]he ultimate goal behind preservation of error rules is to insure (sic) that an issue raised on appeal has first been addressed to and ruled on by the trial court.â€).\r\nNext, Williamson argues Middleton did not actually incur any attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe jury awarded Middleton unpaid commission pursuant to section 39-65-20 of the South Carolina Code.Â  When an employer violates that code section, the employer is liable for â€œattorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably incurred by the sales representative in the action and court costs.â€Â  Williamson argues Middleton never incurred attorneysâ€™ fees because he had no obligation to pay Parham.Â  In support of its argument, Williamson focuses on Parhamâ€™s deposition testimony in which he stated:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e donâ€™t have a fee agreement with Mr. Middleton. Â We talked about this with Mr. Middleton to begin with and we decided that we would try to help him collect the monies due him and at the end of the case, we would talk about a fee.Â  So we donâ€™t have a fee agreement with him.Â  But some day, he might pay us a fee.Â  Right now, he has no obligation at this point if there is no agreement. Â He might feel a moral obligation.Â  And when we talk at the end of the case, he will have the final say.\r\n\r\nWilliamson argues this statement indicates Middleton had neither a fee agreement with nor an obligation to his attorneys, and accordingly, the holding of Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 540 S.E.2d 454 (2000), precludes attorneysâ€™ fees from being awarded.Â  \r\n \r\nIn Hopkins, the supreme court upheld the family courtâ€™s determination that Husband was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees when he was represented at trial by his new wife, an attorney.Â  In so holding, the supreme court not only pointed out there was no fee agreement between Husband and his wife/attorney, but the Hopkins court also stressed there was no â€œindication or testimony that [Husbandâ€™s] wife/attorney intends to collect the fees from [Husband].â€Â  Id. at 307, 540 S.E.2d at 457.Â  \r\n \r\nUnlike Hopkins, there is evidence in this record to indicate Middletonâ€™s attorneys intended to collect their fee from Middleton.Â  While Parhamâ€™s testimony, excerpted above, could be interpreted to mean Middleton would never be required to pay a fee, it also indicates that â€œat the end of the case, [Middleton and his attorneys] would talk about a fee.â€Â  Judge Pyle adopted this latter interpretation, finding that although there was no â€œformal, written fee agreement in this matter,â€ Middleton and his counsel â€œhave relied on their long-standing personal relationship and mutual agreement to determine an appropriate fee for services at the conclusion of this matter.â€Â  Additionally, Parham testified he was hired by Middleton in the Spring of 2001, and since that time, diligent records were kept detailing the amount of time spent on the case.Â  Furthermore, while Parham described Middleton as his â€œgood friend,â€ such a relationship is not akin to the matrimonial bond found in Hopkins from which gratuitous representation would be expected.Â  It would be even less reasonable to believe Ravenhorst, Middletonâ€™s second-chair attorney who had no prior relationship with Middleton, would have volunteered her time without an expectation of being paid.\r\n \r\nAlthough we recognize there was no formal fee agreement between Middleton and his attorneys, the lack of such an agreement does not preclude an attorney from collecting fees.Â  See Singleton v. Collins, 251 S.C. 208, 210-11, 161 S.E.2d 246, 247 (1968) (â€œAn attorney has a right to be paid for professional services rendered, and where there is no express contract, the law will imply one.â€).Â  Although the Singleton case is procedurally different from the case at hand, its determination regarding attorneyâ€™s fees is instructive.Â  In Singleton, an attorney filed an action to collect fees after rendering services to a client in a domestic relations action.Â  Despite the lack of a formal contract, the trial court implied a contract and determined the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees owed.Â  Our supreme court upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision, noting: â€œWhether the services were rendered, and their value, are matters of fact to be decided . . . by the court below, and no appeal lies therefrom if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€Â  Id. at 211, 161 S.E.2d at 247.\r\nAlthough Singleton involves the collection of attorneyâ€™s fees from a client rather than an opposing party, it illustrates that the lack of a formal agreement is not fatal to an attorneyâ€™s claim for fees.Â  Here, the trial judge was not precluded from awarding attorneysâ€™ fees simply because Middleton and his attorneys lacked a written agreement.Â  Rather, so long as there was evidence Middletonâ€™s attorneys intended to collect a fee, the trial judge had discretion to award the fee.Â  Not only did Judge Pyle find there was such evidence, but Judge Miller, whose ruling was reversed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, found an informal agreement existed as well.Â  Because there is competent evidence in the record to support the findings of these two outstanding trial judges, we find no abuse in discretion.\r\nIn addition to its argument that Middleton did not incur attorneysâ€™ fees, Williamson also argues Middleton failed to prove the other elements necessary to recover fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must consider the following six factors: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained.Â  Baron Data Sys, Inc., v. Loter, 297 S.C. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297.Â  â€œWhere an attorneyâ€™s services and their value are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€Â  Id. at 384, 377 S.E.2d at 296 (emphasis added).Â  Here, Judge Pyle made specific findings on each of the six elements, and there is evidence in the record supporting those findings.Â  \r\n \r\nFinally, Williamson argues that even if Middleton was entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees, the amount of attorneysâ€™ fees awarded was unreasonable in light of the meager verdict Middleton received.Â  However, â€œthere is no requirement that attorneyâ€™s fees be less than or comparable to a partyâ€™s monetary judgment.â€Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).Â  Furthermore, although a $35,000 attorneysâ€™ fee may initially seem high for a cause of action for unpaid commissions, especially when the action resulted in a $906.62 verdict, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, there was evidence in the record supporting the trial judgeâ€™s finding that $35,000 was a reasonable amount to award.Â  \r\n \r\nFirst and foremost, it is important to note that Middletonâ€™s attorney did not institute this lawsuit.Â  Rather, in the best tradition of the profession, he attempted to settle this matter with Williamson, and at the specific request of opposing counsel, Middleton delayed bringing suit.Â  However, within a matter of days, Williamson filed suit against Middleton, asserting four causes of action which were ultimately determined to be meritless.Â  In order to litigate his cause of action for unpaid commissions, Middleton had to defend himself against Williamsonâ€™s claim against him for breach of fiduciary duty, which is an affirmative defense for unpaid commissions.Â  Additionally, Middleton submitted affidavits demonstrating how Williamson employed dilatory tactics prior to the trial of this case, such as persuading Middleton to forebear from filing its complaint so that it could be the first to file, cancelling depositions on the afternoon before or the morning of their scheduled time, and submitting incomplete responses to Middletonâ€™s requests for discovery. Moreover, Judge Pyle, who awarded $35,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees, had been the trial judge in this matter, and he was acutely aware of the challenges faced by Middletonâ€™s attorneys.Â  Considering the detailed bills submitted by Middletonâ€™s attorneys and the difficulties they faced in trying their case, we find competent evidence supports the trial judgeâ€™s award of $35,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on our limited standard of review and the unusual circumstances of this case, we find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s award of $35,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees to Middleton.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., each dissent in separate opinions.\r\nANDERSON, J., dissenting in a separate opinion:Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s reasoning and analysis and VOTE to REVERSE the award of fees. \r\n \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFor several years, Middleton worked for Williamson as a commissioned salesman.Â  When Middleton quit working for Williamson, he was due a commission for having sold yarn pallets to one of Williamsonâ€™s customers.Â  Middleton and Williamson disagreed as to the amount of commission due, and Williamson never paid Middleton any commission, even though it acknowledged owing him $906.62.Â \r\n \r\nAfter leaving his employment with Williamson, Middleton began working for Peninsula Plastics, Inc., one of Williamsonâ€™s pallet suppliers.Â  Middleton continued to seek the commission Williamson owed him, and sought assistance from his present attorney.Â  Middleton and his counsel are personal friends, and counsel previously had represented Middleton in less-complicated matters without charge.Â  Middletonâ€™s attorney agreed to help with the claim for commission, and the two were to discuss a fee at the end of the case.\r\n \r\nWilliamson initially was represented by Jordan &amp; Clardy, LLC.Â  Middletonâ€™s attorneys informed Williamson that they had a complaint drafted and were ready to sue in order to recover the unpaid commission.Â  Williamsonâ€™s attorney requested that Middleton refrain from acting on the drafted complaint until he could speak with his client.Â  Middleton agreed, and two days later, Williamson filed a complaint against Middleton, alleging causes of action for fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  Middleton filed an answer, denying the allegations and counterclaiming for commissions owed and sanctions under the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  Approximately one month prior to trial, Williamson hired its current counsel.\r\n \r\nOf Williamsonâ€™s claims against Middleton, only the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty went to the jury.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Middleton on that cause of action and found in favor of Middleton on his counterclaim for unpaid commission, awarding him $906.62 in actual damages.Â \r\n \r\nThe trial judge, Judge Pyle, ruled Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees, but asked the parties to attempt to determine the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees themselves.Â  In the event they could not agree to an amount, Judge Pyle explained he would set the amount for them.Â  The parties could not come to a consensus on the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees, and Middleton petitioned the court for assistance.Â  Judge Miller awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In an unpublished opinion, Williamson v. Middleton, 2005-UP-011 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 11, 2005), this Court found that Judge Pyle had retained exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.Â  We therefore reversed Judge Millerâ€™s award and remanded the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for Judge Pyleâ€™s consideration. \r\n \r\nAt the hearing before Judge Pyle, Williamson argued Middleton was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because (1) he was not the prevailing party; (2) the bill Middletonâ€™s counsel presented documenting over $100,000 worth of work listed hours spent on claims other than the unpaid commission claim for which attorneyâ€™s fees are allowed; and (3) the amount of fees Middletonâ€™s counsel requested, $35,000, far exceeded the $906.62 verdict.Â  Williamson further maintained Middleton did not incur any fees because when Middletonâ€™s counsel was deposed, he admitted there was no fee agreement between him and Middleton.Â \r\n \r\nJudge Pyle acknowledged that Middleton and his attorney had not entered into a formal, written fee agreement, but relied instead â€œon their long-standing personal relationship and mutual agreement to determine an appropriate fee for services at the conclusion of this matter.â€Â  The judge found such an agreement did not preclude attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, Judge Pyle awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Williamson filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which was denied.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThere must be sufficient evidence in the record to support each of the six factors analyzed for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal, absent sufficient evidentiary support on the record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1993).Â  \r\n \r\nThe interpretation of a statute is not a finding of fact.Â  Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 21 S.E.2d 34 (1942).Â  â€œThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.â€Â  Jeter v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No. 26168 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 19, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at 43) (citing Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995); see also Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 621, 611 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.â€) (citations omitted); Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 417, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œ[T]he interpretation of a statute is a matter of law.â€).Â  See, e.g., Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Town of Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 471 S.E.2d 137 (1996); Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996); Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 468 S.E.2d 649 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. SECTION 39-65-30 OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA CODE\r\nWilliamson first argues Middleton is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because he does not meet the requirements of section 39-65-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  Specifically, Williamson points out that this statute only applies to sales representatives who seek to recover commissions on â€œwholesaleâ€ sales, and the commission awarded to Middleton was from a sale made to the ultimate consumer.Â  I find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nInitially, I note that the arguments Williamson made to Judge Pyle on this issue are not reflected in the record on appeal.Â  Williamson did not advance this argument at the hearing before Judge Pyle, and although Williamsonâ€™s counsel refers to a memorandum she filed in opposition to Middletonâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees, that memorandum was not included in the record on appeal.Â  See Taylor v. Taylor, 294 S.C. 296, 299, 363 S.E.2d 909, 911 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œThe burden is on the appellant to furnish a sufficient record on appeal from which this court can make an intelligent review.â€).Â  I acknowledge, however, that Judge Pyle addressed the argument in his order awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, suggesting the argument was set forth in Williamsonâ€™s memorandum.Â  In the order, Judge Pyle found Williamsonâ€™s argument that Middleton was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to section 39-65-30 came too late because during trial, Williamson never objected to the jury instructions referencing section 39-65-30, nor did Williamson challenge Judge Pyleâ€™s initial ruling that Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n \r\nIn its brief to our court, Williamson argues that â€œ[e]ven though the jury returned a verdict . . . that awarded Middleton $906.62 for unpaid commissions, this recovery was sought on alternate grounds, both pursuant to Â§ 39-65-30 and Â§ 41-10-10.â€Â  In so arguing, Williamson implies the juryâ€™s award was based on a statute other than section 39-65-30.Â  Williamson further contends that its argument on this issue is timely because â€œthe request for attorney fees is predicated on entirely different factors than was the request for commissions.â€Â  From the record before this court, there is no indication this specific argument was ever made to the trial court, either prior to the order awarding attorneyâ€™s fees or in Williamsonâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); see also Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œâ€˜Imposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€™â€) (quoting Iâ€™On, L.L.C v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000)); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€).\r\nNext, Williamson argues Middleton failed to prove the elements necessary to recover fees.Â  I agree.\r\nThe general rule is that attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc.,&nbsp;310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660&nbsp;(1993) (citing Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989); Hegler v. Gulf Ins.

App. 1990)).\r\n\r\n\tSection 39-65-30 provides:\r\n\tA principal who fails to comply with the provisions of Section 39-65-20 is liable to the sales representative in a civil action for:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1)Â  all amounts due the sales representative plus punitive damages in an amount not to exceed three times the amount of commissions due the sales representative; and\r\n\t\t(2)Â  attorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably incurred by the sales representative in the action and court costs.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-30 (Supp. 2005).Â  The jury awarded Middleton the unpaid commission pursuant to section 39-65-20.Â  \r\n \r\nWhen awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must consider the following six factors: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained.Â  Baron Data, 297 S.C. at 384-85, 377Â  S.E.2d at 297.Â  When awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, â€œthere is no requirement that [the fees] be less than or comparable to a partyâ€™s monetary judgment.â€Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).\r\nHere, Middleton incurred no attorneyâ€™s fees because no fee agreement existed between Middleton and his attorney.Â  In his deposition, Middletonâ€™s lead counsel stated:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e donâ€™t have a fee agreement with Mr. Middleton.Â  We talked about this with Mr. Middleton to begin with and we decided that we would try to help him collect the monies due him and at the end of the case, we would talk about a fee.Â  \r\n\tSo we donâ€™t have a fee agreement with him.Â  But some day, he might pay us a fee.Â  \r\n\tRight now, he has no obligation at this point if there is no agreement.Â  He might feel a moral obligation.Â  And when we talk at the end of the case, he will have the final say.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nCounselâ€™s testimony admits there was no fee agreement with Middleton.Â  Consequently, there is no obligation to pay, and no fees have been incurred.\r\nHopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 540 S.E.2d 454 (2000), involved Fatherâ€™s action to recover overpayment of child support and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The court found Father was entitled to reimbursement of child support overpayments but held he could not recover attorneyâ€™s fees because his current wife represented him and they did not have a fee agreement.Â  The court began its analysis by noting that Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 100, 529 S.E.2d 14, 17 (2000), held a pro se litigant could not recover attorneyâ€™s fees because â€œa pro se litigant, whether an attorney or layperson, does not become â€˜liable for or subject to fees charged by an attorney.â€™â€Â  343 S.C. at 306, 540 S.E.2d at 457.Â  The Hopkins court declared:\r\n\r\n\t[H]ere, we find no evidence Father actually became â€œliable for or subject toâ€ attorneysâ€™ fees for his attorney/wifeâ€™s service.Â  There is no contract or fee agreement in the record, nor is there any indication or testimony that Fatherâ€™s wife/attorney has attempted or intends to collect the fees from Father.Â  Accordingly, Father did not prove that he became liable for the fees, such that the family court properly denied Fatherâ€™s request.\r\n\r\n343 S.C. at 307, 540 S.E.2d at 457.Â Â   \r\nThe rationale of Hopkins is equally applicable in the instant case.&nbsp; Both Calhoun and Hopkins focused on the litigantsâ€™ lack of liability for attorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; Here, Middletonâ€™s counsel admits Middleton â€œhas no obligation at this point if there is no agreement.â€&nbsp; There is no agreement; therefore, Middleton owes no obligation to pay, and no fees were incurred.&nbsp; Under these facts the trial judge erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; I do NOT hold or rule that a formal fee agreement inter sese client-attorney is necessary as a predicate for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in South Carolina.&nbsp; I do, however, hold that the services rendered by the attorney must have been rendered under circumstances whereby the parties understood that the client was required to pay the attorney for the services rendered, albeit, the amount was not agreed upon and a reasonable fee necessarily must be implied.&nbsp; That was not the situation in this case.&nbsp; The controlling statute in this case mandates that an attorney fee be actually incurred before the court is entitled to award attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nII.Â REASONABLENESS OF ATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nAssumptively concluding that an award for an attorneyâ€™s fee in this case should be given, I address the reasonableness of the attorneyâ€™s fee awarded.Â \r\n \r\nA. Initial Analysis by the Trial Court: Determining Whether Attorneyâ€™s Fees Should Be Awarded\r\nWhen presented with a request for attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must first determine whether such an award is warranted.Â  In making this determination, the following factors should be considered:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\teach partyâ€™s respective ability \r\n\t\t\tto pay his/her own attorneyâ€™s fee;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tbeneficial results obtained by \r\n\t\t\tthe requesting partyâ€™s attorney;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\tthe partiesâ€™ respective \r\n\t\t\tfinancial conditions; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4) \r\n\t\t\teffect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on \r\n\t\t\teach partyâ€™s standard of living.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLanier v.

Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384-85, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297-98 (1989):\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn awarding reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, there are six factors to be considered.Â \r\n\tSee, e.g., Wood v. Wood, 269 S.C. 600, 239 S.E.2d 315 (1977); \r\n\tBentrim v. Bentrim, 282 S.C. 333, 318 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Consideration should be given to all six criteria in establishing reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees; none of these six factors is controlling.Â  \r\n\tDarden v. Witham, 263 S.C. 183, 209 S.E.2d 42 (1974).\r\n\tIn making its determination, the trial court articulated each of the six factors.\r\n\t(1) The Nature, Extent and Difficulty of the Legal Services Rendered.\r\n\tUpon its evaluation of the nature, extent and difficulty of the legal services, the trial court determined that Baron had to expend considerably more time and effort on the case because the defendants had transformed a simple collection action into complex litigation.\r\n\t(2) The Time and Labor Necessarily Devoted to the Case.\r\n\tThe trial court concluded that â€œa review of the statements and affidavits of Baronâ€™s trial attorney indicate clearly that the time and labor spent were reasonable and not duplicative.â€Â  The respondents did not dispute this conclusion.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (3) The Professional Standing of Counsel.\r\n\r\n\tThe circuit courtâ€™s determination that Baronâ€™s trial attorney is an experienced, skilled attorney, of high professional standing in the community was based upon a careful review of the affidavits of Baronâ€™s expert and its trial attorney, which included the attorneyâ€™s resume.Â  Respondents did not contest the trial courtâ€™s determination.\r\n\t(4) The Contingency of Compensation.\r\n\tNot applicable since this was not a contingency case.\r\n\t(5) The Fee Customarily Charged in the Locality for Similar Legal Services.\r\n\tBased upon a review of the attorneyâ€™s resume, affidavits and its familiarity with attorney fees customarily charged in this legal community, the trial court found that the rate of $100 per hour was appropriate.\r\n\t(6) The Beneficial Results Obtained.\r\n\tThe trial court decided that the total benefits obtained by Baron include a sizeable judgment ($16,151) and the avoidance of nearly half a million dollars in liability on the counterclaims.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded that Baron sought over $70,000 and recovered only $16,151, thus the beneficial result was not significant.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tI conclude that the trial court properly applied the relevant factors and that its order is supported by the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGlasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991):\r\n\r\n\r\n\t[W]e clarify the six factors cited by this Court in determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee include:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case;\r\n\t\t(2) the time necessarily devoted to the case;\r\n\t\t(3) professional standing of counsel;\r\n\t\t(4) contingency of compensation;\r\n\t\t(5) beneficial results obtained;\r\n\t\t(6) customary legal fees for similar services.\r\n\t\r\n\tDonahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989).Â  While â€œcontingency of compensationâ€ is an appropriate factor considered in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the contingency to be considered is whether the party on whose behalf the services were rendered will be able to pay the attorneyâ€™s fee if an award is not made.Â  Further, the factor â€œbeneficial results obtainedâ€ merely aids in determining whether an award is appropriate when considering whether the services of a lawyer facilitated a favorable result.Â  Neither of these factors endorses use of a percentage fee. . . . .\r\n\tFurther, we hold that a fee award must be based upon a reasonable hourly fee.Â  Applying the above six factors to determine an appropriate fee award, the reasonableness of the hourly rate shall be determined according to: (1) the professional standing of counsel; and (2) the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  The reasonableness of the number of hours billed shall be determined according to: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; and (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case.[FN1]\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[FN1] As discussed above, the remaining factors, â€œcontingency of compensationâ€ and â€œbeneficial results obtainedâ€ are to be considered in determining whether an award should be made.Â  In making this determination, the abilities of the parties to pay, their respective financial conditions, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each partyâ€™s standard of living are also to be considered.Â  \r\n\t\tMitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 320 S.E.2d 706 (1984).\r\n\t\r\n\r\nApplying these factors here, we find the total hourly fee of $51,998.75 reasonable and affirm the award of attorneyâ€™s fees in this amount.\r\n\r\n\tTaylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580-81, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461-62 (1998):\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court considered each of the above factors in setting the attorneyâ€™s fee award.Â  The trial judge based his award on the affidavits submitted by Mrs. Taylorâ€™s three attorneys and the affidavit of an attorney who did not participate in this matter but attested the hourly rates and hours submitted were appropriate.Â  The trial judge noted he had presided over a number of the discovery motions in this case, all of the pretrial motions, and the two and one-half week trial.Â  The court determined the amount of time estimated by Mrs. Taylorâ€™s attorneys, approximately 1500 hours, was appropriate, if not conservative.Â  The court recognized all of Mrs. Taylorâ€™s attorneys were experienced and capable trial attorneys and agreed the hourly rates for each were appropriate.Â  The court noted the attorneys had accepted this case on a contingency fee basis and opined it thought UTPA actions were one of the most difficult types of cases to try.Â  The trial court recognized the beneficial results obtained by the attorneys, both in terms of the $108,726 recovered under the UTPA by Mrs. Taylor from CIBL and in terms of the public benefit in deterring CIBL from similar conduct.\r\n\tIn addition, the trial court took judicial notice that CIBL vigorously contested Mrs. Taylorâ€™s claims it had violated the UTPA, thereby requiring Mrs. Taylor to present witnesses in response.Â  Mrs. Taylorâ€™s experts testified CIBLâ€™s laboratory tests were excessive, â€œabsolutely bizarre,â€ and the results were questionable.Â  One expert testified he believed the tests were conducted for the purpose of generating income.Â  One witness testified there was no medical reason for any of the tests.Â  Another witness testified the tests were painful to Mrs. Taylor yet medically worthless.\r\n\tWe have reviewed the affidavits submitted by counsel and agree they are somewhat deficient.Â  One affidavit includes approximately 78 hours of time for work performed prior to the filing of Mrs. Taylorâ€™s second amended complaint.Â  Moreover, the affidavits do not specifically state the time spent on the UTPA claim against CIBL.\r\n\tIn spite of these deficiencies, we conclude there is evidence which supports the approximately 1500 hours of time spent by Mrs. Taylorâ€™s attorneys on this matter.Â  The affidavits note the time spent by other attorneys and some legal professionals was not submitted for reimbursement. Â The judge who presided over the majority of this matter stated the submitted time was, in his view, conservative.Â  Furthermore, time spent is but one factor to consider in setting a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee.Â \r\n\tBaron Data Systems, Inc. v. Loter, supra.\r\n\tWith regard to the issue of estimates, two of the three affidavits state the attorneys did not keep records of the time spent on this case.Â  Nonetheless, the accompanying time sheets do list specific services rendered and the time spent performing each service.Â  We conclude the affidavits and accompanying time sheets fairly reflect the time spent by the attorneys on this matter.\r\n\tFinally, there is no requirement that an attorneyâ€™s fee be less than or comparable to a partyâ€™s monetary judgment.Â  This Court has approved an award of attorneyâ€™s fees where the fee substantially exceeded the actual recovery.Â \r\n\tBaron Data Systems, Inc. v. Loter.\r\n\tWe conclude the trial judge properly considered all six factors in determining the appropriate attorneyâ€™s fee and find his decision awarding $500,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $24,068 in costs is supported by the record.Â \r\n\tJackson v. Speed, supra.Â  (Footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nC.&nbsp; Court is Required to make Findings of Fact for Each of the \r\nSix Factors\r\nâ€œWhen an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is requested and authorized by contract or statute, the court should make specific findings of fact on the record for each factor set forth in Collins v. Collins, [239 S.C. 170, 122 S.E.2d 1 (1961)].â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1993).\r\nâ€œOn appeal, absent sufficient evidentiary support on the record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Id.Â  This proposition has been interpreted by our courts to mean that an award for attorneyâ€™s fees will not be reversed due to a lack of findings in the order when the record supports the judgeâ€™s determination.Â  See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997) (â€œ[A]n award for attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record supports each factor.â€); McMaster v. Strickland, 322 S.C. 451, 455, 472 S.E.2d 623, 626 (1996) (affirming special refereeâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees notwithstanding his failure to make specific findings about each of the six Blumberg factors because the record contained ample support for each of the six factors).\r\nEncapsulating the facts of this case and the law, I conclude that the amount of the award of the attorneyâ€™s fee is NOT supported by the evidentiary record.Â  Further, the amount of the award is unreasonable and unjustified.Â  In reviewing the Baron Data factors and juxtaposing the evidentiary record to the law extant, I come to the ineluctable conclusion that the amount of the award of attorneyâ€™s fees far exceeds any notion of reasonableness.Â Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI hold that in South Carolina under section 39-65-30 of the South Carolina Code an attorneyâ€™s fee must be actually incurred before the court can award an attorneyâ€™s fee.Â  Additionally, I determine that the amount of the award of the attorneyâ€™s fee in the case sub judice is unreasonable under the facts and law.Â  Accordingly, I VOTE to REVERSE the award of fees because no attorneyâ€™s fee was incurred in this case.Â  Alternatively, even if an award of an attorneyâ€™s fee is appropriate under the statute, I VOTE to REMAND for further consideration as to a reasonable amount.Â  \r\n \r\nBEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Rule 219 SCACR states that en banc consideration is not favored and ordinarily will not be granted except:Â  (1) when consideration by the full court is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of its decisions; or (2) when the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.Â  The case sub judice does not adhere to either exception.Â  Therefore, I dissent.\r\nSHORT, J., (dissenting in a separate opinion):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I join in Judge Andersonâ€™s dissent in finding no attorney fee agreement existed between Middleton and his attorney.Â Â  However, having found the absence of a fee agreement, I do not find it necessary to address the reasonableness of the attorneyâ€™s fee in this matter.\r\nCURETON, A.J.: (Dissenting in separate opinion): I too agree with Judge Andersonâ€™s dissent to the extent it finds no attorney fee agreement was ever entered into between Middleton and his attorney.Â  I also agree with Judge Short that having concluded there was no fee agreement, there is no need to address the reasonableness of the attorney fee award.\r\n\r\n[1] In a split decision, a three-judge panel from this court reversed the award.Â  See Williamson v. Middleton, Op. No. 4135 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 10, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 27 at 47).Â  We granted en banc review, which has again resulted in a divided court.Â  Five panel members vote to affirm the award, and four panel members vote to reverse it.Â  This division results in an affirmance of the trial judgeâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-90 (Supp. 2006) (requiring a concurrence of six of the judges when reversing the judgment below). \r\n \r\n[2] The Hanahan case to which Williamson cites sets forth an equitable standard of review when attorneyâ€™s fees are awarded as a sanction for filing a frivolous proceeding.Â  Under the Frivolous Proceedings Act, a judge, sitting without a jury, determines whether the party against whom attorneyâ€™s fees are sought initiated litigation in bad faith or with no reasonable cause.Â  This is an equitable determination, and therefore, an equitable standard of review is used when considering the trial judgeâ€™s award of fees.Â  See Brown v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., 275 S.C. 276, 269 S.E.2d 769 (1980).Â  Unlike a fee awarded as a sanction under the Frivolous Proceedings Act, the attorneyâ€™s fee awarded to Middleton was based on the juryâ€™s award of commissions pursuant to section 39-56-20 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006).Â  A party who violates section 39-56-20 is liable for â€œattorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably incurred by the sales representative in the action . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-56-30 (Supp. 2006).Â  Thus, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees was based upon the juryâ€™s finding for Middleton and was not an equitable determination by the trial judge.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4244","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, Commission on Indigent Defense, of Appellate Defense.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  A circuit court judge, during a bench trial, convicted Omar Gentile of trafficking in cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine within proximity of a school.Â  Gentile asserts the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the drug evidence on the ground the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 9:45 p.m. on July 10, 2004, officers with the narcotics division of the Charleston Police Department forcibly executed a search warrant for Gentileâ€™s residence in Charleston.Â  Pursuant to the search, the officers seized one plastic bag containing 24.34 grams of cocaine and $988 in cash from Gentileâ€™s person.Â  The officers also discovered six plastic bags containing 2.14 grams of cocaine. Â Gentile ultimately admitted that the drugs belonged to him. As a result, a Charleston County grand jury indicted Gentile for trafficking in cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine within proximity of a school.Â  \r\n \r\nPrior to his bench trial, Gentile filed a written motion to suppress all evidence seized from his residence.Â  In his motion, Gentile argued there was no probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant.Â  During the trial, the court reviewed the search warrant and accompanying affidavit and heard testimony from the officers involved in the search.Â \r\n \r\nThe affidavit in support of the search warrant provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tInvestigators recieved [sic] information of narcotic activity at 23 Cleveland ST Apartment A.Â  Investigators conducted periodic surveillance on 23 Cleveland ST and observed a black male enter the residence.Â  Black male subject was observed leaving the residence.Â  Subject was stopped by narcotic investigators and recovered approximately 4.0 grams of marijuana.Â  Subject made no stops from time of leaving residence until stopped by investigators.Â  Based on above information, there is probable cause to believe narcotics (marijuana) and proceeds from narcotic sales to be stored inside 23 Cleveland ST Apartment A., Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nOfficer George Bradley, the officer who procured the warrant from the magistrate, testified regarding his affidavit as well as the oral testimony he gave to the magistrate.Â  According to Bradley, the Charleston Police Department received citizen complaints regarding suspected narcotics traffic at Gentileâ€™s residence. Â Bradley testified the citizens claimed to have witnessed heavy foot traffic â€œin and out of the residence, later in the afternoon up until the wee morning hours.â€ Â As a result of these tips, Bradley and Officer Steven Sierko conducted surveillance of the residence.Â  Bradley testified they observed â€œseveral black males entering and leaving the residence, walking in, being in there less than five minutes.â€Â  Bradley alerted officers in a nearby unmarked patrol car regarding one particular visitor.Â  Corporal Andre Jenkins followed the visitorâ€™s vehicle as it left the residence and then conducted a traffic stop for an obstructed license plate.Â  Jenkins arrested the driver of the vehicle after he refused to produce his driverâ€™s license and then engaged in a physical altercation.Â  A search of the driverâ€™s person revealed two bags of marijuana.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nAfter this arrest, Corporal Jenkins contacted Bradley to inform him that he believed there was probable cause for a search warrant based on the officersâ€™ observations regarding the traffic at the residence and the subsequent arrest of one of the visitors. Â Jenkins also testified that he established his belief on the citizen tips regarding the traffic at the residence as well as the complaint of one citizen who claimed she smelled marijuana in the vicinity of the residence. \r\n \r\nBased on the citizen tips, his observations during the surveillance, the arrest of one of the visitors, as well as his experience, Bradley believed narcotics transactions were being conducted at Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  Bradley testified he presented this information to the magistrate who ultimately signed the warrant for the search of Gentileâ€™s residence.\r\nAt the conclusion of the suppression hearing testimony, Gentileâ€™s counsel reiterated his motion to suppress.Â  He asserted the search warrant was invalid because there was no probable cause.Â  Specifically, he claimed there was no independent verification of what transpired within Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  Instead, counsel averred the citizen complaints, the officersâ€™ observations, and the arrest were a series of unrelated events that did not support a finding of probable cause. Â The judge denied the motion, finding the search warrant was properly issued based on the totality of the circumstances.Â  Although the judge recognized that there was no â€œindication with regards to the reliability of the informant information,â€ he found the officers did not seek a warrant solely on this information.Â  Instead, the judge found significant that the warrant was procured based on the officersâ€™ â€œown investigation, through their own observations . . . which through their experience as narcotics officers for several years have proven to indicate the presence of drug activity.â€ \r\n \r\nThe judge convicted Gentile of trafficking in cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine within proximity of a school.Â  He sentenced Gentile to twenty-five years imprisonment for the trafficking offense and a concurrent, ten-year sentence for the other offense.Â  Gentile appeals his convictions and sentences. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  â€œA deferential standard of review likewise applies in the context of a Fourth Amendment challenge to a trial courtâ€™s fact-driven affirmation of probable cause.â€Â  State v. Thompson, 363 S.C. 192, 199, 609 S.E.2d 556, 560 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGentile argues the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.Â  We agree. \r\n \r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œ[t]he right of the people to be secure . . . [from] unreasonable searches and seizures.â€ U.S. Const. amend. IV. Â â€œIn parallel with the protection of the Fourth Amendment, the South Carolina Constitution also provides a safeguard against unlawful searches and seizures.â€ Â State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 643, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10. Â Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in both state and federal court. Forrester, 343 S.C. at 643, 541 S.E.2d at 840.\r\nA magistrate may issue a search warrant only upon a finding of probable cause.Â  State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999).Â  â€œThis determination requires the magistrate to make a practical, common-sense decision of whether, given the totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying the information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.â€Â  State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 150, 561 S.E.2d 640, 644 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThe affidavit must contain sufficient underlying facts and information upon which the magistrate may make a determination of probable cause.Â  The magistrate should determine probable cause based on all of the information available to the magistrate at the time the warrant was issued.â€Â  State v. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 684, 583 S.E.2d 437, 441 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).\r\nIn discussing the specific requirements for issuing a search warrant, our supreme court has explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe General Assembly has imposed stricter requirements than federal law for issuing a search warrant. Both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Â§ 10 of the South Carolina Constitution require an oath or affirmation before probable cause can be found by an officer of the court, and a search warrant issued.Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§Â  10. Â Additionally, the South Carolina Code mandates that a search warrant â€œshall be issued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 17-13-140 (1985). Oral testimony may also be used in this state to supplement search warrant affidavits which are facially insufficient to establish probable cause. \r\n\tSee State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997). Â However, â€œsworn oral testimony, standing alone, does not satisfy the statute.â€ \r\n\tState v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 352 S.E.2d 471 (1987).\r\n\r\nState v. Jones, 342 S.C. 121, 128, 536 S.E.2d 675, 678-79 (2000).\r\nIn terms of a courtâ€™s review of the magistrateâ€™s decision, â€œ[t]he duty of the reviewing court is to ensure the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause existed.â€ Â State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 50, 625 S.E.2d 216, 221 (2006).Â  â€œIn reviewing the validity of a warrant, an appellate court may consider only information brought to the magistrateâ€™s attention.â€Â  State v. Thompson, 363 S.C. 192, 200, 609 S.E.2d 556, 560 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nReviewing this case within the above-outlined parameters, we find the affidavit and the supplemental oral testimony were insufficient to provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for which to find probable cause to issue the search warrant for Gentileâ€™s residence.\r\nAlthough we are cognizant that our decision should be based on the totality of the circumstances, for analytical purposes we find it necessary to separately address each piece of evidence presented to the magistrate.Â \r\n \r\nThe narcotics officersâ€™ decision to investigate Gentile was precipitated primarily by the receipt of citizen complaints regarding a high volume of traffic at Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  Even though the officers verified the pattern of traffic at Gentileâ€™s residence, this, without additional investigation into the residence, was not sufficient to establish that narcotics activity was taking place.Â  See State v. Hunt, 562 S.E.2d 597, 601-02 (N.C. Ct. App. 2002) (reversing trial courtâ€™s decision denying defendantâ€™s motion to suppress drug evidence and stating â€œ[a]ll that the affidavit offers are complaints from citizens suspicious of drug activity in a nearby house.Â  There is no mention of anyone ever seeing drugs on the premises.Â  The citizens only reported heavy vehicular traffic to the house.Â  The officer verified the traffic.Â  His verification, as the trial court found, was not a conclusion.â€); Bailey v. People, 15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 17, 19-20 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992) (finding information from an anonymous informer and an unidentified citizen regarding heavy foot traffic at defendantâ€™s residence, without investigation, was insufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant; stating â€œâ€˜heavy foot trafficâ€™ does not necessarily engender criminal behavior.Â  True, under certain circumstances, such activity might raise suspicions, or be one indicator of possible narcotics transactions.â€).Â Â Â \r\n \r\nNext, we consider the single citizen claim that she smelled marijuana in the vicinity of Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  Initially, we question whether the magistrate was privy to this information.Â  Based on our review of the record, we are unable to find where Bradley, the officer who obtained the warrant, testified regarding this information.Â  Instead, the only reference to this tip was through the testimony of Corporal Jenkins. Â Furthermore, there is no mention in the affidavit regarding this tip.Â  Therefore, it is questionable whether it was communicated to the magistrate.Â  Â Â \r\nEven if we conclude that Bradley communicated to the magistrate the citizenâ€™s tip, we find it was insufficient to establish probable cause.Â  First, the tip is vague in that there is no indication of how many times the citizen may have smelled marijuana or that she could readily identify that the odor was emanating from Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  Secondly, there was no indication that the citizen was knowledgeable about the smell or marijuana.Â  Significantly, there was no independent verification by the narcotics officers regarding this tip.[2]\r\nFinally, the arrest of one of Gentileâ€™s visitors did not support a finding of probable cause to search the residence.[3]Â  According to the testimony and the affidavit, the officers discovered marijuana in the possession of the driver after he left Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  The officers, however, had no knowledge of whether the driver purchased the marijuana from Gentile.Â  Neither the driver nor his vehicle was searched prior to going to Gentileâ€™s residence.Â  Furthermore, without surveillance within Gentileâ€™s residence, there was no verification that the driver in fact purchased marijuana from Gentile.Â  Additionally, it is important to note that the officersâ€™ search of Gentileâ€™s residence revealed cocaine and not marijuana.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the search warrant was invalid under the totality of the circumstances, and thus, the circuit court judge erred in admitting the drug evidence. Â \r\nWe find support for our decision in the factually similar opinion of People v. Titus, 880 P.2d 148 (Colo. 1994)(en banc).Â  In Titus, the defendant was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute or sell and possession of marijuana.Â  The drug evidence was discovered at Titusâ€™s residence pursuant to the execution of a search warrant.Â  The Colorado Springs Police Department procured the warrant based on the following information:Â  1). a first-time anonymous informant alleged defendant was engaged in selling marijuana at his residence, there was unusual traffic at defendantâ€™s residence, and that she had smelled the odor of burning marijuana coming from the residence; 2). the informant gave police a list of the license plate numbers of those that visited the defendantâ€™s residence; 3). police officersâ€™ verification of the license plate numbers and the traffic at the defendantâ€™s residence; 4). an attempted controlled buy of narcotics from defendant; and 5). the fact that the defendant was self-employed and operated a telephone repair business out of his home.\r\nPrior to trial, the court granted the defendantâ€™s motion to suppress the drug evidence found at his residence on the ground the affidavit underlying the search warrant did not establish probable cause.Â  Id. at 149.Â  The prosecution appealed the decision.Â  On appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court, sitting en banc, affirmed the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Â In reaching this decision the court found â€œthe police had no indication, apart from the anonymous informantâ€™s suspicions and the police informantâ€™s conversation with Titus, that Titus was engaged in criminal activity.â€Â  Id. at 151.Â  In terms of the high volume of traffic at the defendantâ€™s residence, the court stated â€œ[t]he fact that a large number of people visit a residence in a one-month period does not establish that illegal activity is taking place.â€Â  The court also relied on the fact that there was nothing in the affidavit to suggest that â€œany of the [visiting] vehicles belonged to known drug offenders, or were used in the furtherance of any illegal activity.â€Â  Id.Â  Finally, the court rejected the prosecutionâ€™s reliance on the anonymous informantâ€™s claims that she smelled the odor of burned marijuana coming from the defendantâ€™s residence on several occasions.Â  Id. at 152.Â  The court found that â€œ[u]nder no circumstances do [the claims] support the conclusion that Titus was selling marijuana out of his home.â€Â  Id.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the court found significant the fact that:\r\n\r\n\t[t]he affidavit does not state the circumstances under which the informant smelled the odor of burned marijuana.Â  Nor does it disclose how many times she smelled it.Â  Most importantly, however, it does not disclose when these olfactory experiences took place.Â  There is no indication that the police officer attempted to determine whether the informant had smelled marijuana burning recently, or whether the event was remote in time.\r\n\r\nId. \r\nAs in Titus, we find the warrant to search Gentileâ€™s home was not supported by probable cause.Â  The narcotics officersâ€™ decision to obtain the search warrant was based on citizensâ€™ tips regarding high volume traffic at Gentileâ€™s residence, which was not necessarily indicative of illegal activity at the residence.Â  Additionally, the citizen claim regarding the smell of marijuana in the vicinity of Gentileâ€™s residence was vague and not corroborated by the officersâ€™ surveillance.Â  Finally, as previously discussed, the officersâ€™ arrest of a visitor to Gentileâ€™s residence adds nothing to the probable cause determination.Â  Without more, we find the evidence in the affidavit and the oral testimony was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\r\nAccordingly, Gentileâ€™s convictions and sentences are \r\n \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Because the narcotics officers did not verify the citizen tip regarding the odor of marijuana, we find the instant case distinguishable from State v. Ford, 323 S.E.2d 358 (N.C. Ct. App. 1984), a case relied upon by the State at trial and on appeal.Â  In Ford, the defendant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana based on a search of his residence which revealed 10,000 pounds of marijuana.Â  On appeal, Ford challenged the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion to suppress the drug evidence on the ground the supporting affidavit failed to show sufficient probable cause to justify the issuance of the search warrant.Â  Id. at 361.Â Â  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision, finding that evidence presented to the magistrate regarding unusual traffic at a residence in conjunction with the surveillance officerâ€™s detection of marijuana odors coming from within a mobile home, which was identified as belonging to Ford, was sufficient to constitute probable cause.Â  Id. at 361-62.Â  In the instant case, unlike in Ford, the surveillance officers did not verify the citizenâ€™s vague claim regarding the smell of marijuana.Â  Without further investigation by the narcotics officers, we do not believe the citizenâ€™s general claim was sufficient to establish probable cause.\r\n[3]Â Â  At trial, the State relied on two cases decided by this court for the proposition that an arrest, which yields the presence of narcotics, is sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant for the location of where the arrestee came from prior to the arrest.Â  See State v. Keith, 356 S.C. 219, 225, 588 S.E.2d 145, 148 (Ct. App. 2003) (affirming decision of trial court to admit drug evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant for defendantâ€™s residence where the following facts established probable cause:Â  informantsâ€™ tips regarding drug transactions at the defendantâ€™s home; surveillance by law enforcement; and a traffic stop of the defendant after leaving his residence which revealed the presence of a marijuana â€œbudâ€ and a pipe in the defendantâ€™s vehicle); State v. Scott, 303 S.C. 360, 362-63, 400 S.E.2d 784, 785-86 (Ct. App. 1991)(affirming defendantâ€™s convictions for trafficking in cocaine and unlawfully transporting drugs in a motor vehicle and finding affidavit in support of search warrant was sufficient to establish probable cause where affidavit was based on information from surveillance officers who followed defendant leaving his residence and ultimately arrested him and searched his vehicle which revealed the presence of twenty grams of cocaine).Â  \r\n \r\nThese cases are clearly distinguishable from the instant case.Â  In both Keith and Scott, the defendant was arrested and searched after leaving his residence.Â  Here, Gentile was not arrested.Â  Instead, the surveillance officers followed and arrested a third party.Â  This person, a visitor at Gentileâ€™s residence who had not been searched prior to his arrival, was not a target of their surveillance.Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4245","title":"Sheppard v.

Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4245\r\nHeard April 10, 2007 â€“ Filed May 14, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBonnie Travaglio Hunt and Michael A. Timbes, both of Charleston, for Appellants.Â \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tG. Thomas Hill, of Ravenel, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Russ Pye, Lee Pye, and Justin Enterprises (collectively Appellants) relocated an easement appurtenant to property now owned by John R. and William J. Sheppard.Â  On appeal, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order requiring Appellants to restore the easement to its original location.Â \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants and the Sheppards own adjacent tracts of land, which were both derived from a larger tract known as Encampment Plantation.Â  The Sheppardsâ€™ tract (the dominant estate) includes a right of ingress and egress across Appellantsâ€™ tract (the servient estate).Â  This easement originated in a deed conveying to John Carlton Fox the tract the Sheppards now own.Â  The deed conveyed â€œthe right to the use and enjoyment of the Avenue leading from Highway #17 to the property above described . . . for the use of all present and future owners of said property . . . .â€Â \r\n \r\nThe deed to Fox also references an attached plat that shows the â€œAvenue.â€ Â Prior to the easementâ€™s relocation, access to the dominant estate required one to turn from Highway 17 onto the avenue and continue straight until reaching a cul-de-sac on the servient estate.Â  At that point, one would turn left onto an old dirt road, then almost immediately turn right onto a separate access road, crossing other property before arriving at the dominant estate.Â \r\n \r\nIn September 2001, Appellants blocked the access to the old dirt road from the cul-de-sac and created a new road between the avenue and the access road.Â  Consequently, when attempting to access the dominant estate, the Sheppards must turn onto the avenue from Highway 17 and make a slight left turn onto the new road.Â  The new road connects with the old dirt road at a point closer to the access road.Â  From the new road, the Sheppards must turn left onto the old dirt road.Â  The right turn from the old dirt road onto the access road remains the same.Â \r\n \r\nOn May 16, 2002, Developments Unlimited, LLC, the Sheppardsâ€™ immediate predecessor in title, filed suit against Appellants, requesting the circuit court require Appellants to remove their obstructions to the original access point and restore this portion of the easement to its previous condition.Â  The Sheppards were substituted as plaintiffs when they purchased the dominant estate from Developments Unlimited.Â  After a hearing on the merits, the circuit court granted the relief the Sheppards requested.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in equity.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190&nbsp;(1997).Â  Accordingly, this court may review the circuit courtâ€™s findings de novo.Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 164-65, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes Â§ 4.8 \r\n\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in refusing to apply the Restatement (Third) of Property: Â Servitudes Â§ 4.8 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) (the Restatement) to allow them to unilaterally relocate the easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nTraditionally, the location of an easement, once selected or fixed, cannot be changed by the owner of the servient estate without the express or implied consent of the owner of the dominant estate. Â Goodwin v. Johnson, 357 S.C. 49, 53, 591 S.E.2d 34, 36&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  The Restatement, however, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tExcept where the location and dimensions are determined by the instrument or circumstances surrounding creation of a servitude, they are determined as follows . . . . (3) [u]nless expressly denied by the terms of an easement . . . the owner of the servient estate is entitled to make reasonable changes in the location or dimensions of an easement, at the servient ownerâ€™s expense, to permit normal use or development of the servient estate, but only if the changes do not (a) significantly lessen the utility of the easement, (b) increase the burdens on the owner of the easement in its use and enjoyment, or (c) frustrate the purpose for which the easement was created.\r\n\r\nIn Goodwin, this court adopted the Restatement with respect to easements created by necessity.Â  Goodwin at 57-58, 591 S.E.2d at 38.Â  However, the Goodwin court recognized â€œit should be more difficult to relocate an express easement, as it is akin to a contract and is bargained for by the parties.â€Â  Id. at 55, 591 S.E.2d at 37 (emphasis in original).Â  Moreover, we find no indication by our appellate courts that South Carolina would adopt the Restatement with respect to easements acquired by express grant.\r\nEven if the Restatement could afford relief in a case involving an easement created by grant, we hold Appellantsâ€™ case is not one in which the rule should be applied.Â  Specifically, James H. Southard, Jr., the owner of Developments Unlimited, testified that, prior to September 2001, he used the easement to access the dominant estate with his tractor-trailer.Â  After September 2001, he would not attempt to traverse the relocated easement with his heavy equipment.Â  In addition, he complained he was forced to make four turns instead of two, and the turns came closer together, which prevented larger vehicles from making the turns.Â  \r\n \r\nNevertheless, Appellants contend that because the Sheppards purchased the dominant estate after the relocation had occurred they cannot claim any right to the original easement.Â  However, we see no reason why the Sheppards should be unable to claim the full extent of the easement rights conveyed to them, which were the same rights given to Fox and Developments Unlimited.Â  Although the purchase agreement between Developments Unlimited and the Sheppards indicates the property is being sold â€œAS IS,â€ the agreement also acknowledges the existence of the ongoing litigation concerning the easement giving the Sheppards an expectation that the easement could be returned to its original location.Â  Moreover, Appellants agree the easement is appurtenant to the dominant estate and not a mere personal privilege.Â  See e.g., Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997) (distinguishing between an easement appurtenant and one in gross).Â  Consequently, the proper analysis is to examine whether the relocation increased the burden on the dominant estate, not just the current owners.\r\nWe find, as did the trial court, that Appellantsâ€™ actions increased the burden on the dominant estate.Â  Therefore, there was no error in refusing to apply the Restatement rule.\r\nII.&nbsp; Implied Consent\r\nAppellants also argue Southard impliedly consented to the relocation of the easement.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAny action which would tend to deceive or mislead may constitute sufficient grounds for a court to find acquiescence or an implied consent to [a] relocated easement.â€Â  Henning v. Neisz, 268 N.E.2d 310, 316 (Ind. Ct. App. 1971).Â  Here, Appellants presented testimony that Southard asked them to relocate the easement.Â  C. C. Harness, III, an attorney representing Appellants, attempted to negotiate a relocation with the attorney for Southard, but Harness testified no agreement was reached.Â  Russ Pye explained he relocated the easement at the request of Southard, but acknowledged the path of the new road was chosen more by forces of nature (lightning eliminating trees) than by any human choice.Â  Southard specifically testified he did not consent to the relocation of the easement.Â  We find a preponderance of the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s decision that Southard did not, impliedly or otherwise, consent to the easementâ€™s relocation.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the circuit court properly refused to apply the Restatement to provide relief to Appellants.Â  More particularly, we find the relocation increases the burden on the dominant estate.Â  In addition, a preponderance of the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Southard did not impliedly consent to the relocation.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4246","title":"Duckett v.

Duckett (â€œDuckettâ€) initiated an action in Greenwood County Family Court to determine paternity and adjudicate custody and child support in regard to Ronald R. Goforth (â€œGoforthâ€).Â  The family court found it lacked jurisdiction to address Duckettâ€™s petition and dismissed the action.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe minor child â€œH.J.â€ was allegedly conceived as the result of a relationship between Duckett and Goforth while they were in the Philippines.Â  Duckett was married to Frank Raymond Greenhough (Greenhough) who, according to Duckett, was in Australia at the time of H.J.â€™s conception.Â  In June 1994, Duckett learned she was pregnant and informed Goforth.Â  Because she was frightened of having a child on her own, Duckett asked Greenhough for his assistance and they reconciled.Â  Both agreed that Greenhough would serve as H.J.â€™s father.Â  On February 1, 1995, Duckett gave birth in the Philippines.Â  In 1997, Duckett and Greenhough moved from the Philippines to Australia.[2] \r\nOn February 1, 2000, Duckett filed an application for dissolution of the marriage and designated H.J. as a child of the marriage, but on March 30, 2000, Duckett submitted an affidavit in which she averred that Goforth was H.J.â€™s biological father.Â  \r\nOn March 27, 2000, the Australian family court issued a Decree Nisi of Dissolution of Marriage between Duckett and Greenhough.Â  The decree incorporated previously issued orders awarding Duckett custody, assigning joint financial responsibility for H.J., and providing Greenhough with visitation rights.Â  The tribunal declared it was satisfied that H.J. was the only child of the marriage and proper arrangements for her welfare had been made.Â  In addition, a restraining order remained in place to prevent either party from removing H.J. from the Western State of Australia without written consent.Â  \r\nOn June 4, 2001, Duckett and H.J. left Australia without the Australian courtâ€™s permission and traveled to the United States, where they have remained for the last five years.Â  Duckett settled in Greenwood County and remarried.Â  \r\nOn December 14, 2001, Duckett petitioned the Washington County Family Court in the State of Arkansas, where Goforth resided, to determine paternity and award child support. Â Duckett named Goforth as the father but did not name Greenhough as a party or notify him of the proceedings.Â  Goforth moved to dismiss, alleging Arkansas was not H.J.â€™s home state and the Arkansas court lacked jurisdiction.Â  Ultimately, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled the Washington County Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition because Arkansas was not the home state of the child.Â  \r\nOn August 27, 2002, Greenhough filed an application in accordance with the Hague Convention for H.J.â€™s return to Australia. Â Two days later, Greenhough filed an application, pursuant to the Hague Convention, for the enforcement of the Australian visitation order.Â  On March 4, 2004, Greenhough filed an application in Australia seeking the return of H.J.Â  The application was dismissed following a hearing on January 24, 2005.\r\nDuckett instituted this action in the Greenwood County Family Court requesting a finding of paternity, child support and other related relief. Â Goforth moved to dismiss, arguing the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction by virtue of the prior rulings of the Australian and Arkansas courts and the on-going litigation in Australia.Â  Additionally, he alleged the family court lacked personal jurisdiction.Â  He pled res judicata as a defense.Â  The family court issued the following order:Â  \r\n\r\n  24. This Court finds that it does lack subject matter jurisdiction.Â  It is clear that the child was born during the marriage of the Plaintiff [Duckett] and husband [Greenhough].Â  There is a presumption that the husband is the father.Â  It is noted that the divorce decree of the Plaintiff and husband made findings in relation to visitation, support and custody of the child between the husband and Plaintiff, and that neither party appealed that ruling. \r\n  25. Further, that the Plaintiffâ€™s subsequent conduct of applying to the Australian Court for both the divorce and permission to remove the child from Australia reinforces to this Court the continuing effect of that Australian Courtâ€™s order and jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  24.[3]Â Â The Court also finds that since there is a presumption that a child born during the marriage is a product of the husband and wife, Plaintiff must first establish that the husband is not the father of the child before she can bring an action to declare another person (Goforth) as the father.Â  This Court has been provided no proof that this child born of the marriage is not the child of the father.Â  Without such evidence, this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendant pursuant to SCRCP 12(b)(2).\r\n  25.Â Next, Goforth argues that this matter should be dismissed as this Court must acknowledge and recognize the Australian decrees. . . .Â  Since there has been an adjudication of these matters and recent pending litigation in the Australian Courts, this Court declines to exercise jurisdiction in this instance. \r\n  26. Finally, Goforth argues that this matter has been litigated and appealed to the highest Court of the State of Arkansas.Â  Additionally, the issue of paternity has been litigated in Australia, and that court has ruled that this is a child of the marriage.Â Â Â  These orders have never been contested or appealed and are final.Â  Specific rulings and findings have been issued, and this Court must give full faith and credit to those orders and findings.Â  This Court agrees. \r\n\r\nDuckett filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration, which the family court denied.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.Â Â Â Did the family court err in concluding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction when South Carolina is the home state of the minor child?\r\nII.Â Â Did the family court err in concluding it did not have personal jurisdiction over Goforth?\r\nIII.Â Â Did the family court err in concluding it was without jurisdiction because of a prior Australian decree?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002)); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (citing Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E. 2d 154, 157 (1996)).Â  However, our broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the burden of convincing this court the family court committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. at 190, 612 S.E.2d at 711 (citing Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA)\r\nA. Â Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n Duckett contends South Carolina is the home state of the child and the family court erred in finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We agree.Â  Additionally, Duckett maintains the family court erred in concluding this matter should be dismissed because the court must recognize the Australian decree in accordance with section 20-7-830 of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter of a proceeding is determined by the Constitution, the laws of the state, and is fundamental.â€Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 205, 522 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Because Duckettâ€™s amended complaint included a request for custody, the jurisdictional question requires analysis under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA).[4] Â Â \r\n\r\n  The UCCJA was enacted to:\r\n  (1) avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts in other states in matters of child custody . . . ; (2) promote cooperation with the courts of other states to the end that a custody decree is rendered in that state which can best decide the case in the interest of the child; (3) assure that litigation concerning the custody of a child take place ordinarily in the state with which the child and his family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning his care, protection, training and personal relationships is most readily available. . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-784 (1985) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nUnder the UCCJA, a state has jurisdiction to make an initial or change in custody determination if \r\n\r\n  (1) this State (i) is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or (ii) had been the childâ€™s home state within six months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this State because of his removal or retention by a person claiming his custody or for other reasons, and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this State; or\r\n  (2) it is in the best interest of the child that a court of this State assume jurisdiction because (i) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with this State and (ii) there is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships; or\r\n  (3) the child is physically present in this State and (i) the child has been abandoned or (ii) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because he has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is otherwise neglected or dependent; or\r\n  (4) (i) it appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under prerequisites substantially in accordance with paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (a), or another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this State is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child and (ii) it is in the best interest of the child that this court assume jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (a)(1985); Charest v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511, 518, 495 S.E.2d 784, 787 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Â§ 20-7-788 (b) (suggesting that when another state has declined jurisdiction, physical presence in this state of the child, or of the child and one of the contestants, may be sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a court of this state to make a child custody determination).\r\nSouth Carolina is unquestionably the home state of this child.Â  â€œHome stateâ€ means the state where the child lived with a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the time of the action. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-786(5) (1985); Charest, 329 S.C. at 518, 495 S.E.2d at 788.Â  H.J. has resided with her mother in Greenwood County since June 2001, well over the six consecutive months preceding commencement of this action.Â  Indeed, by the time of this appeal, H.J. will have lived nearly half of her life in South Carolina.Â  Williams v. Williams, 285 S.C. 270, 272, 329 S.E.2d 751, 751 (1985) (holding where mother and child had lived in South Carolina for seven years prior to the action, South Carolina was the home state and the more convenient forum under UCCJA).Â  \r\nAdditionally, H.J. has attended the same school in Greenwood County since entering the first grade.Â  All records pertaining to her schooling are in Greenwood County.Â  H.J.â€™s medical care has been provided in Greenwood County since she was six years old.Â  Substantial evidence concerning H.J.â€™s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships is available only in South Carolina.Â  Moreover, the Arkansas Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the matter, acknowledging that Arkansas was not H.J.â€™s home state.Â  \r\nGoforth considers Australia the â€œdecree state.â€ Â A South Carolina court may not modify a decree from another state unless: â€œ(1) it appears to the court of this State that the court which rendered the decree does not now have jurisdiction under jurisdictional prerequisites substantially in accordance with this subarticle or has declined to assume jurisdiction to modify the decree and (2) the court of this State has jurisdiction.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-810(a) (1985).Â  The UCCJA defines â€œstateâ€ as â€œany state, territory or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-786(10) (1985).Â  \r\nConcomitantly, Goforth suggests that section 20-7-830 requires South Carolina courts to recognize the continuing jurisdiction of the Australian tribunal.Â  Â This section applies UCCJA provisions relating to the recognition and enforcement of decrees issued by other states â€œto custody decrees and decrees involving legal institutions similar in nature to custody, rendered by appropriate authorities of other nations if reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard were given to all affected persons.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann Â§ 20-7-830 (1985). [5]\r\nThe parties dispute whether a foreign country is the same as another state under the UCCJA.Â  We need not reach that determination.Â  Even if Australia were recognized as the â€œdecree state,â€ it no longer retains jurisdiction under jurisdictional prerequisites substantially in accordance with the UCCJA.Â  Â§ 20-7-810(a)(1), supra. Â \r\nAlthough more than one state may meet the jurisdictional requirements under the UCCJA, once a custody decree has been entered, the continuing jurisdiction of the decree state is exclusive.Â  Charest v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511, 518, 495 S.E.2d 784, 788 (Ct. App. 1997) (citingÂ  Sinclair v. Albrecht, 287 S.C. 20, 336 S.E.2d 485 (Ct. App. 1985)). Â Jurisdiction continues if one parent resides in the decree state and substantial evidence remains there, even though another state has become the childâ€™s home state. Â Id.Â  A court may exercise continuing jurisdiction when â€œthere are sufficient contacts with the child and his parent(s) to justify legitimate state interest in the outcome of the dispute, and if sufficient evidence is available to enable the court to make a fair determination of custody based upon the best interest of the child.â€ Â Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 87, 620 S.E.2d 333, 340 (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Cullen v. Prescott, 302 S.C. 201, 206, 394 S.E.2d 722, 725 (Ct. App. 1990)).\r\nOn the other hand, if connection with the decree state ends because all parties involved have moved away or contact with the decree state has become slight, another state may assume jurisdiction to modify the decree. Â Knoth v. Knoth, 297 S.C. 460, 463, 377 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1989) (explaining that jurisdiction of the decree state is exclusive and continues unless the state no longer meets the jurisdictional requirements or declines to exercise jurisdiction) (emphasis added).Â  The South Carolina family court may obtain jurisdiction if it is in the best interest of the child because (1) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with the state and (2) substantial evidence is available in the state concerning the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (a)(2) (1985) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nâ€œCourts will exercise jurisdiction based upon these criteria if there are sufficient contacts with the child and his parent(s) to justify legitimate state interest in the outcome of the dispute, and if sufficient evidence is available to enable the court to make a fair determination of custody based upon the best interest of the child.â€Â  Cullen v. Prescott, 302 S.C. 201, 206, 394 S.E.2d 722, 725 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nIn Cullen, 302 S.C. at 205, 394 S.E.2d at 724, we reversed the family courtâ€™s conclusion that it did not have jurisdiction to modify a Georgia custody decree.Â  We found section 20-7-788(a)(2) provides South Carolina courts may assume jurisdiction of a custody dispute upon a finding that it is in the best interest of the child to do so, if the child and a parent have significant connection with this state and substantial evidence is available in the state concerning the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships. Â Cullen, 302 S.C. at 205, 394 S.E.2d at 724.\r\nOur reasoning in Cullen applies to the circumstances in the case sub judice.Â  H.J. has not lived in Australia since 2001 but has lived in South Carolina with her mother nearly half of her life.Â  Evidence concerning her present and future welfare is available only in South Carolina.Â  Moreover, contact with Australia has become so slight that it no longer meets jurisdictional requirements under section 20-7-788(a).Â  Because the Australian tribunal no longer has jurisdiction over the matter, South Carolina has jurisdiction and can modify the prior custody decree as the home state.Â  It is in H.J.â€™s best interest that the question of paternity be resolved.Â  To ensure that custody litigation takes place where H.J. has the closest connection, the South Carolina family court should adjudicate the issues in this case.Â  \r\nFurthermore, South Carolina has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this dispute where it affects welfare and protection of its young citizenry.Â  The legislature has granted the family court broad and comprehensive authority in providing for children in this State.Â  21 S.C. Jur. Children and Families, Â§ 153.Â  To that end, the family court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings to compel the support of a child; to include in the requirements of an order for support the providing of necessary shelter, food, clothing, care, medical attention, expenses of confinement, both before and after the birth, the expense of educating his or her child and other proper and reasonable expenses; to require persons able to provide support to pay a fair and reasonable sum on a periodic basis; to make orders for support until the child is eighteen years of age or is emancipated or where there are physical or mental disabilities; to determine the manner in which child support is paid, that is, directly or through the court; to require a person ordered to support another to give security; to hold those persons who violate court orders with regard to child support in contempt and to sentence them appropriately; to modify or vacate any order; and to make any order necessary to carry out and enforce the provisions of the Code, all without the intervention of a jury.Â  Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (Supp. 2006)).Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe only limitation upon the courtâ€™s power to provide for the maintenance of children, including security therefor, is that such provision shall be just and equitable, considered in the light of the circumstances of the parties, the nature of the case, and the best interests of the children.â€Â  Id. (citing Fender v. Fender, 256 S. C. 399, 408, 182 S. E. 2d 755, 759 (1971)).\r\nB. Venue\r\nDuckett asserts that South Carolina is the proper venue to determine the issues in this case.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œEven if South Carolina has jurisdiction to consider a custody issue, the Family Court in its discretion may decline to exercise jurisdiction if it finds that it is an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances and another State is a more appropriate forum.â€Â  Charest v Charest, 329 S.C. 511, 519, 495 S.E.2d 784, 788 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n\r\n  In determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, the UCCJA provides a court should consider whether it is in the childâ€™s interest that another state assume jurisdiction by evaluating the following factors, among others: (1) If another state is or recently was the childâ€™s home state; (2) If another state has a closer connection with the child and his family or with the child and one or more of the contestants; (3) If substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships are more readily available in another state; (4) if the parties have agreed on another forum which is no less appropriate;(5) If the exercise of jurisdiction by a court of this State would contravene any of the purposes state in Â§ 20-7-784.\r\n\r\nId. (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-796(c) (1985)).\r\nAs H.J.â€™s home state for nearly one-half of her life, South Carolina has the most significant connections with her present and future welfare.Â  No other State or country has a closer connection to H.J. and her mother.Â  Substantial evidence of H.J.â€™s care, protection, training and personal relationships are NOT more readily available in another state.Â  Accordingly, under these circumstances we rule South Carolina is not an inconvenient forum in which to adjudicate the issues in this action.\r\nC.Â Personal Jurisdiction\r\nDuckett argues the trial court erred in determining the family court did not have personal jurisdiction over Goforth.Â  We agree. \r\nThe UCCJA establishes that personal jurisdiction of an out of state resident may be obtained if the following requirements are satisfied:\r\n\r\n  Â (a) Notice required for the exercise of jurisdiction over a person outside this State shall be given in a manner reasonably calculated to give actual notice, and may be:\r\n  \r\n    (1) by personal delivery outside this State in the manner prescribed for service of process within this State;\r\n    (2) in the manner prescribed by the law of the place in which the service is made for service of process in that place in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction;\r\n    (3) by any form of mail addressed to the person to be served and requesting a receipt;\r\n    (4) as directed by the court, including publication, if other means of notification are ineffective.\r\n  \r\n  (b) Notice under this section shall be served, mailed or delivered, or last published, at least twenty days before any hearing in this State. Â Provided, however, that in proceedings pursuant to Â§ 20-7-788 (a) (3) above, upon a showing by the moving party that an emergency or abandonment situation exists within the meaning of Â§ 20-7-788 (a) (3) so as to place the child in jeopardy, the court may shorten the notice period to such period as it may deem to be in the best interests of the child.\r\n  (c) Proof of service outside this State may be made by affidavit of the individual who made the service, or in the manner prescribed by the law of this State, the order pursuant to which the service is made, or the law of the place in which the service is made. Â If service is made by mail, proof may be a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to the addressee.\r\n  (d) Notice is not required if a person submits to the jurisdiction of the court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-792 (1985). \r\nService on Goforth was properly effected at least twenty days prior to the April 11, 2005 hearing on his motion. Â Importantly, Goforth appeared for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction in his motion to dismiss, indicating he had actual notice of the proceedings.Â  Duckett satisfied the service of process requirements under the applicable law of this State to give the family court personal jurisdiction over Goforth.Â Â  Accordingly, we hold the family court erred in finding it lacked personal jurisdiction.\r\nThe family court, nonetheless, determined it lacked personal jurisdiction over Goforth because no evidence existed to rebut the presumption that Greenhough was H.J.â€™s father.Â  \r\nâ€œThe presumption of legitimacy, although rebuttable, is one of the strongest known to law.â€Â  Hudson v. Blanton, 282 S.C. 70, 75, 316 S.E.2d 432, 434 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Barrâ€™s Next of Kin v. Cherokee, Inc., 220 S.C. 447, 68 S.E.2d 440 (1951).Â  â€œEvery child born in wedlock is presumed to be legitimate.â€Â  Id. (citing Tarleton v. Thompson, 125 S.C. 182, 118 S.E. 421 (1923)).Â  The presumption of a husbandâ€™s access to his wife â€œmust be overcome by the clearest evidence that it was impossible for him, by reason of impotency or imbecility, or entire absence from the place where the wife was during the period of conception,â€ to have fathered the child. Â Id. at 75, 316 S.E.2d at 435 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIt strains the imagination to conceive of a more persuasive record rebutting the presumption of paternity.Â  Admittedly, Greenhough signed H.J.â€™s birth certificate at Duckettâ€™s request and agreed to be H.J.â€™s father because Duckett feared raising a child on her own.Â  However, Greenhoughâ€™s January 12, 2000 affidavit indicated he and Duckett understood Greenhough was not H.J.â€™s biological father.Â  Greenhough claimed he was infertile and he never acknowledged paternity.Â  Shortly after filing her 2001 petition for divorce in Australia, Duckett named Goforth the putative biological father.Â  Her affidavit of April 11, 2005 alleged Greenhough was unable to father a child and was not H.J.â€™s biological father.Â  Additionally, Duckett explained she believed Goforth was the biological father because they were sexually involved when H.J. was conceived, and she was not having a sexual relationship with her husband at the time of conception.Â  Significantly, Greenhough was physically located in Australia when H.J. was conceived in the Phillipines.Â  \r\nThe testimony of a husband and wife as to â€œany relevant matterâ€ is admissible on the issue of paternity, including testimony regarding parentage and marriage.Â  Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 359 (3d ed. 2001) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-956 (A)(8) (1976).Â  Although irrelevant to the determination that the family court had personal jurisdiction over Goforth, we conclude Duckettâ€™s evidence sufficiently rebutted the presumption of Greenhoughâ€™s paternity.Â  \r\nII. Â Res judicata\r\nDuckett claims the family court erred in finding custody, child support, and paternity had been litigated in Australia and in affording full faith and credit to the Australian tribunalâ€™s ruling.Â  We agree. \r\nThough not specifically referring to the doctrine of res judicata in its order, it appears the family court intended to rule that either res judicata or collateral estoppel barred litigation of the issues in the present action. \r\nRes judicata precludes parties from subsequently relitigating issues actually litigated and those that might have been litigated in a prior action.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 249, 551 S.E.2d 274, 278 (Ct. App. 2001) (citation omitted).Â  The doctrine flows from the principle that public interest requires an end to litigation and no one should be sued twice for the same cause of action.Â  Town of Sullivanâ€™s Island v. Felger,&nbsp;318 S.C. 340, 344, 457 S.E.2d 626, 628&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œRes judicata is the branch of the law that defines the effect a valid judgment may have on subsequent litigation between the same parties and their privies. Â Res judicata ends litigation, promotes judicial economy and avoids the harassment of relitigation of the same issues.â€ Â Nelson v. QHG of S.C., Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 304, 580 S.E.2d 171, 178 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 642 (2d ed. 1996)) revâ€™d in part on other grounds, 362 S.C. 421, 608 S.E.2d 855 (2005).Â  A party seeking to preclude litigation on the grounds of res judicata must show: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue on the merits in the former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction. Â Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999). Â \r\nRes judicata does not bar the present litigation.Â  The parties to the Australian litigation were Duckett and Greenhough; Goforth and Duckett are parties in the present litigation.Â  The subject of the Australian proceeding was adjudication of custody, child support, visitation, and other related issues between Duckett and Greenhough.Â  The action here is for determination of paternity, an award of custody, and child support between Duckett and Goforth.Â  The issues of custody and child support have never been litigated between Duckett and Goforth.Â  Moreover, the issue of paternity was not fully and finally adjudicated by the Australian tribunal.[6]Â  \r\nâ€œCollateral estoppel prevents a party from relitigating in a subsequent suit an issue actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.â€ Â Â Stone v. Roadway Express, 367 S.C. 575, 580, 627 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2006).Â  \r\n\r\n  A party may assert nonmutual collateral estoppel to prevent relitigation of a previously litigated issue unless the party sought to be precluded did not have a fair and full opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding, or unless other circumstances justify providing the party an opportunity to relitigate the issue. \r\n\r\nWade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, 317, 498 S.E.2d 684, 688 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  However, collateral estoppel is an affirmative defense which must be pled and because Goforth never raised the defense, he may not invoke the defense on appeal.Â  Jordan v. Jordan, 284 S.C. 342, 346, 326 S.E.2d 416, 418 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding defensive collateral estoppel is an affirmative defense and thus, must be plead).\r\nNotwithstanding this procedural roadblock, collateral estoppel would not preclude Duckett from asserting a paternity claim against Goforth.Â  Paternity was not â€œactually and necessarily litigated and determinedâ€ in the prior Australian proceeding.Â  The family court erred in concluding the Australian decree constituted a determination of paternity.Â  \r\nPaternity is defined as â€œthe state or condition of a father; the relationship of a father.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1126 (6th ed. 1990).Â  Determining parentage is inextricably linked to this Stateâ€™s strong interest in the protection of its children and provision for their welfare.Â  Sections 20-7-952 through 958 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) encapsulate the legislatureâ€™s policies in this regard: \r\nAn action to establish the paternity of an individual may be brought by:\r\n\r\n  (1) A child;\r\n  (2) The natural mother of a child;\r\n  (3) Any person in whose care a child has been placed;\r\n  (4) An authorized agency, including, but not limited to, the Department of Social Services, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 43, and any other person or agency pursuant to the provisions of Â§Â§ 20-7-435 and 20- 7-840; or\r\n  (5) A person who claims to be the father of a child.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-952 (C) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\n\r\n  As soon as practicable after an action has been commenced, the court, upon its motion or that of an interested party, may order the natural mother, the putative father, and the child to submit to genetic tests such as red blood cell antigen testing, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing, electrophoresis, or other tests which have been developed for the purpose of proving or disproving parentage and which are reasonably accessible. . . .\r\n  For all child support cases not administered under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, the child and all parties in a contested paternity case, upon the request of any party to the action, must be ordered by the court to submit to the genetic testing, as provided for in subsection (A), to determine paternity.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-954 (A), (C) (Supp. 2006). \r\n\r\n  Upon a finding that the putative father is the natural father of the child, the court must issue an order designating the putative father as the natural father. Â The order also shall set forth the social security numbers, or the alien identification numbers assigned to resident aliens who do not have social security numbers, of both parents. Â The order shall establish a duty of support and provide for child support payments in amounts and at a frequency to be determined by the court. Â The order also shall provide for other relief which has been properly prayed for in the pleadings and which is considered reasonable and just by the court. Â Upon a finding that the putative father is not the father of the child, the court shall issue an order which sets forth this finding.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-957 (Supp. 2006).\r\nThe Australian tribunal found that H.J. was a â€œchild of the marriageâ€ in the context of issuing the divorce decree.Â  As Duckett points out in her brief on appeal â€œ â€˜child of the marriageâ€™ for the purposes of use in a[n Australian] Decree Nisi for dissolution of marriage is defined as child (including an ex-nuptial child of either the husband or the wife, a child adopted by either of them or a child who is not a child of either of them) is a child of the marriage, if the child was treated by the husband and wife as a child of their family at the relevant time.â€™ â€ Appellantâ€™s Brief on Appeal (citing Australian Family Law Act Â§ 55A(3) Part VIÂ  (1975)).Â  Notably, a â€œchild of the marriageâ€ in Australia may include children who are not the biological progeny of either spouse.\r\nIn South Carolina, a paternity determination for the purposes of child support relates to the natural or biological relationship between father and child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann Â§Â§ 20-7-952 through 958 (Supp. 2006).Â  While a child born during a marriage is the presumed legitimate child of the husband, that presumption may be rebutted by a paternity determination.Â  Douglass ex rel. Louthian v. Boyce, 344 S.C. 5, 8, 542 S.E.2d 715, 716-17 (2001) (interpreting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-952 (E) (1985)).Â  Treating a child as a child of the family during the marriage does not rise to the level of a paternity determination in South Carolina.Â  Accordingly, it is incumbent on the family court to address the question of Goforthâ€™s paternity in order to assure H.J. is supported in a manner consistent with South Carolinaâ€™s legislative mandate. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that South Carolina is unquestionably the home state of the minor child and the proper venue for adjudication of the issues presented herein.Â  The Australian tribunal no longer satisfies jurisdictional requirements under the UCCJA to retain jurisdiction over matters involving H.J.â€™s interests.Â  We rule personal jurisdiction over Goforth was properly obtained according to the applicable provisions of the UCCJA. Â Neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel bars this action.Â  The prior Australian proceeding involved different parties and the issue of paternity was never fully and finally litigated.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court dismissing this action is \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] At some point, Duckett became an Australian citizen.\r\n[3] Numbering error is exactly as it appears in the record.\r\n[4] The UCCJA was adopted in South Carolina in 1981 and codified in the South Carolina Code of Laws sections 20-7-782 through 830 (1985).Â  See Sinclair v. Albrecht, 287 S.C. 20, 21, 336 S.E.2d 485, 486 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\n[5] In order to invoke section 20-7-830, all parties affected by the Australian proceeding must have been afforded reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard on the issue of paternity, assuming, as Goforth claims, that paternity was actually litigated.Â  As the putative biological father Goforth was an affected party.Â  Yet, nothing in the record indicates he received any notification of the proceeding.Â  Therefore, Goforthâ€™s reliance on section 20-7-830 to have the Australian decree recognized and enforced by the South Carolina family court is misplaced. \r\n[6] The Arkansas Supreme Court determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed Duckettâ€™s action, thus never reaching the merits.Â  Accordingly, res judicata based on the Arkansas litigation does not bar the present action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4247","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Larry Gene Moore appeals his conviction of armed robbery.Â  He argues the evidence does not show he used force or intimidation in his asportation of stolen property.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 17, 2004, Mark Hayes, a loss prevention officer at a Wal-Mart store in Spartanburg, was on duty when he observed a shopper, Larry Gene Moore, exhibiting suspicious behavior.Â  Only minutes earlier, Hayes noticed the customer had placed several items of merchandise in his shopping cart, and thus became alarmed when he realized Mooreâ€™s cart was presently vacuous.Â  Hayes witnessed Moore pick up a package of over-the-counter medication from the shelf, place it inside his jacket, and begin walking toward the door.\r\nHayes approached Moore shortly after he stepped outside onto the storeâ€™s sidewalk.Â  After identifying himself and his position with Wal-Mart, Hayes informed Moore he needed to speak with him regarding some unpaid merchandise.Â  During the time Hayes was talking, Moore began digging around in his back pocket.Â  At first, Hayes believed Moore might be looking for a receipt.Â  However, when Moore stated, â€œWhat this, are you sure,â€ Hayes looked down at Mooreâ€™s hand to discover the thief was brandishing a semiautomatic .22 caliber handgun.Â  \r\n \r\nFearing for his own safety and that of Wal-Martâ€™s customers, Hayes immediately ended the encounter and went back into the building to make certain the police were apprised of the situation.Â  Moore walked off of Wal-Martâ€™s premises but was apprehended by police a short time later.Â  $454.60 in unpaid Wal-Mart merchandise was recovered from Mooreâ€™s possession.Â  \r\n \r\nMoore was charged with armed robbery.Â  At the close of the Stateâ€™s case, he moved for a directed verdict and requested the charge be lowered to petty larceny.Â  Moore argued, inter alia, that armed robbery could not be proven because asportation of the property occurred before the confrontation and no force or threat of force was used to take the merchandise.Â  After extensive arguments, the trial judge denied the motion for a directed verdict, finding the offense of armed robbery requires asportation, which includes the escape.Â  It was during the commission of the crime that Moore threatened use of the weapon.Â  At the close of the evidence, Moore renewed his directed verdict motion.Â  The motion was denied. Â Moore was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to fifteen years.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006); State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 506, 626 S.E.2d 59, 63 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Thus, an appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 504 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nâ€œThe appellate court may reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.â€Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 103, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002)).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); Douglas, 367 S.C. at 506, 626 S.E.2d at 63; State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506 (2005); Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 274 S.E.2d 290 (1981); see also Simon v. Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 550, 99 S.E.2d 391, 393-94 (1957) (â€œ â€˜[E]rror at lawâ€™ exists: (1) when the circuit judge, in issuing [the order], was controlled by some error of law ... or (2) where the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, considerations, is without adequate evidentiary support.â€); McSween v. Windham, 77 S.C. 223, 226, 57 S.E. 847, 848 (1907) (â€œ[T]he determination of the court will not be interfered with, unless there is an abuse of discretion, or unless the exercise of discretion was controlled by some error of law.â€).\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 625 S.E.2d 641 (2006); Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005); State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004);Â  State v. Rosemond, 356 S.C. 426, 430, 589 S.E.2d 757, 758-59 (2003); State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â  A case should be submitted to the jury if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 562 S.E.2d 313 (2002); State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 555 S.E.2d 402 (2001); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 411, 578 S.E.2d 32, 35 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000) (stating where the evidence is circumstantial, a trial court has the duty to submit a case to jury so long as there is substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove guilt of accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced). Â â€œ[I]n ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.â€Â  State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 64, 447 S.E.2d 177, 181-82 (1993).Â  Â \r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003); State v. Rothschild, 351 S.C. 238, 243, 569 S.E.2d 346, 348 (2002); State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 580 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 274, 584 S.E.2d 138, 141 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial court should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 605 S.E.2d 529 (2004); State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 132, 322 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1984); State v. Horne, 324 S.C. 372, 379, 478 S.E.2d 289, 293 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œSuspicionâ€ implies a belief or opinion as to guilt that is based upon facts or circumstances that do not amount to proof.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001); Zeigler 364 S.C. at 103, 610 S.E.2d at 863.Â  A trial judge is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypotheses.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 470 S.E.2d 851 (1996).\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. at 274, 584 S.E.2d at 141; State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 364, 574 S.E.2d 203, 205 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury. Â State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 190, 562 S.E.2d 320, 323 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 232, 522 S.E.2d 845, 853 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMoore argues the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal on the charge of armed robbery.Â  He alleges the charge of armed robbery was improper because the evidence does not show he used force or intimidation to take Wal-Martâ€™s merchandise, but only to retain the property and escape.Â  We disagree.\r\n1. THE LAW EXTANT AS TO ARMED ROBBERY \r\nArmed robbery occurs when a person commits robbery while either armed with a deadly weapon or alleging to be armed by the representation of a deadly weapon. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330 (2003); see also State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 424, 578 S.E.2d 32, 42 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œArmed robbery occurs when a person commits robbery either while armed with a deadly weapon or while the person was alleging he was armed and was using a representation of a deadly weapon.â€). Â Included in armed robbery is the lesser included offense of robbery.Â  State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 125-126, 322 S.E.2d 15, 16 (1984). Â Our statutory scheme specifies that the definition of robbery is to be provided by South Carolinaâ€™s common law. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-325 (2003) (stating: â€œThe common law offense of robbery is a felony. Â Upon conviction, a person must be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.â€); see also Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 424, 578 S.E.2d at 42 (â€œOur statutory scheme provides that the crime of robbery is defined by the common law.â€).\r\nâ€œRobbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€Â  Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 424, 578 S.E.2d at 42 (citing State v. Parker, 351 S.C. 567, 571 S.E.2d 288 (2002); Joseph v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 571 S.E.2d 280 (2002)). Â Our supreme court has described robbery as â€œthe felonious taking and carrying away of goods of another against the will or without consent.â€Â  State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 126, 322 S.E.2d 15, 16 (1984).Â  â€œThe gravamen of a robbery charge is a taking from the person or immediate presence of another by violence or intimidation.â€ Â State v. Rosemond, 356 S.C. 426, 430, 589 S.E.2d 757, 758-59 (2003) (citing State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 276 S.E.2d 163 (1981)).Â  â€œWhen determining whether the robbery was committed with intimidation, the trial court should determine whether an ordinary, reasonable person in the victimâ€™s position would feel a threat of bodily harm from the perpetratorâ€™s acts.â€Â  Rosemond, 356 S.C. at 430, 589 S.E.2d at 759.\r\nThe elements of robbery and armed robbery include asportation of the property.Â  State v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 598, 325 S.E.2d 325, 326 (1985.\r\nâ€œThe common-law offense of robbery is essentially the commission of larceny with force.â€ State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 49, 260 S.E.2d 719, 720 (1979). Â â€œIn common parlance[,] larceny is just plain stealing.â€ Â State v. Roof, 196 S.C. 204, 209, 12 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1941); see also Gill v. Ruggles, 95 S.C. 90, 78 S.E. 536 (1913) (noting that â€œstealingâ€ is the popular word for the technical word â€œlarcenyâ€).Â  Larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of another against the ownerâ€™s will or without his consent.â€ Â Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 424, 578 S.E.2d at 42 (citing Broom v. State, 351 S.C. 219, 569 S.E.2d 336 (2002); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 562 S.E.2d 320 (Ct.App.2002)). Â Larceny is a lesser-included offense of the crime of armed robbery. Â See State v. Parker, 351 S.C. at 570-71, 571 S.E.2d at 290 (â€œLarceny has been found to be a lesser-included offense of robbery by this Court on several occasions.â€); State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (petit larceny is a lesser-included of strong armed robbery); State v. Harkness, 288 S.C. 136, 341 S.E.2d 631 (1986) (petit larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery). Â â€œLarceny is also implicit within the crime of shoplifting.â€Â  Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 424, 578 S.E.2d 32, 42; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-110 (2003) (defining the offense of shoplifting).Â  \r\n \r\nThus, it is the use or alleged use of a deadly weapon that distinguishes armed robbery from robbery, and the employment of force or threat of force that differentiates a robbery from a larceny.Â  See Scipio 283 S.C. at 126, 322 S.E.2d at 16 (the additional element of being armed with a deadly weapon distinguishes robbery and armed robbery); Brown, 274 S.C. at 49, 260 S.E.2d at 720 (adding force to larceny creates the common-law offense of robbery). Â \r\n2. THE CONTINUOUS OFFENSE THEORYÂ  \r\nState v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 325 S.E.2d 325 (1985), is edifying.Â  In Keith, although unarmed at the time the confrontation began, the defendant accosted a man walking along a public street.Â  After rifling through the victimâ€™s pockets and taking the cash from his wallet, the defendant found the victimâ€™s pocketknife and stabbed the man repeatedly.Â  The assailant was convicted of armed robbery and on appeal contended the conviction was improper because he did not become armed until after having taken the victimâ€™s money.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court disagreed:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e hold that when a defendant commits robbery without a deadly weapon, but becomes armed with a deadly weapon before asportation of the victimâ€™s property, a conviction for armed robbery will stand. â€œ[T]he robber need not be armed at all times during the robbery in order to be guilty of (armed robbery). [H]e is guilty . . . if he arms himself or becomes armed with a deadly weapon at any time during the progress of the taking or while the robbery is being perpetrated . . .\r\n\t[T]he crime of robbery is not completed the moment the stolen property is in the possession of the robbers, but may be deemed to continue during their attempt to escape.â€ Â 77 C.J.S.\r\n\tRobbery, Â§ 25 (1952). See also, State v. Bridges, 444 So.2d 721 (La. App. 1984); \r\n\tPeople v. Heller, 131 Ill.App.2d 799, 267 N.E.2d 685 (Ill. 1971).\r\n\r\nId., 283 S.C. at 598-99, 325 S.E.2d at 326 (emphasis added) (ellipses and parenthesis in the original).\r\nKeith pellucidly adopts the â€œcontinuous offense theory.â€Â  In the context of robbery, the continuous offense theory provides that the crime has occurred â€œnot only if the perpetrator uses force or intimidation to â€˜takeâ€™ possession of the property, but also if force or intimidation is used to retain possession immediately after the taking, or to carry away the property, or to facilitate escape.â€ Â State v. Meyers, 620 So.2d 1160, 1163 (La. 1993) (citing Charles E. Torcia, 4 Whartonâ€™s Criminal Law Â§ 478 (14th ed.1981)); see also People v. Randolph, 648 N.W.2d 164 (Mich. 2002) (explaining what it referred to as â€œthe transactional approachâ€ as follows:Â  â€œUnder this approach, a defendant has not completed a robbery until he has escaped with stolen merchandise.Â  Thus a completed larceny may be elevated to a robbery if the defendant uses force after the taking and before reaching temporary safety.â€).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tAmerican Jurisprudence elucidates:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe other basic perspective is that the use of force or intimidation in retaining the property generally, or in effecting retention of the property in an escape attempt, or even merely as a means of escaping after the property has been abandoned supply the element of force or intimidation necessary to make the offense a robbery.Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n67 Am. Jur. 2d Robbery Â§ 27 (2003) (internal footnotes omitted).\r\nThe Model Penal Code espouses the theory, focusing on whether the force or intimidation asserted against the victim is part of the entire act, and includes the use of force or intimidation to retain possession of the thing taken or to escape or prevent pursuit.Â  Model Penal Code Â§ 222.1(1) (2001). Â The code has adopted the position that a robbery occurs if the force or intimidation takes place â€œin the course of committing a theftâ€ and specifies that the commission of a theft includes the flight after the attempt or commission. Â Id.Â  Â \r\nThe efficacy of the rule is to distinguish the perpetration of a robbery from the commission of a larceny and a subsequent assault, limiting the latter to cases where the intimidation or force is not directly related to the taking.Â  The rationale behind the differentiation of robbery and larceny buttresses the adoption of the continuous offense approach:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he purpose of the force or intimidation element of the crime of robbery is to distinguish, by imposition of a more severe penalty, those takings which pose a greater risk to the victim. The danger to the victim, however, is identical whether the force or intimidation is employed against the victim immediately before or immediately after the actual taking. We therefore conclude that the force or intimidation element of robbery is satisfied by evidence that force or intimidation directly related to the taking occurred in the course of completing the crime.\r\n\r\nState v. Meyers, 620 So.2d 1160, 1163 (La. 1993).\r\nIn instances when a thief must use force to retain the stolen property, the thief does not acquire full possession of the property until the force or threat of force has overcome the custodianâ€™s resistance to the taking. Â See Whartonâ€™s Criminal Law Â§ 463, at 39-40 (15th ed. 1996). Â Thus, a â€œtakingâ€ is not completeâ€”that is to say, has not come to an endâ€”until the perpetrator has neutralized any immediate interference with his or her possession. Â Id. Â This does not mean, of course, that a thief has not committed a robbery or larceny unless and until resistance to his possession has been overcome. Â Indubitably, the point of asportation is not absolutely determinative.Â  A criminal is guilty of the crime, and not merely of an attempt, if he moves the stolen goods a short distance, and concomitantly, the crime is ongoing until the thief has reached a place of temporary safety.Â  See Ball v. State, 699 A.2d 1170, 1185 (Md. 1997).\r\nAn exhaustive review of the relevant authorities reveals plenitudinous jurisdictions adopting the continuous offense theory by statute.Â  See, e.g., Ala.

App. 1966) (â€œif a struggle immediately ensues to keep possession of the property and the thief overcomes the resistance * * * the violence is sufficient to constitute an act of robbery.â€); People v. Kennedy, 294 N.E.2d 788 (Ill. App. 1973) (â€œwhile the taking may be without force, the offense is robbery if the departure with the property is accomplished by the use of force.â€); People v. Estes, 147 Cal.App.3d 23 (1983) (â€œThe crime of robbery is a continuing offense that begins from the time of the original taking until the robber reaches a place of relative safety. Â It is sufficient to support the conviction that appellant used force to prevent the guard from retaking the property and to facilitate his escape. . . . Â Whether defendant used force to gain original possession of the property or to resist attempts to retake the stolen property, force was applied against the guard in furtherance of the robbery and can properly be used to sustain the conviction.â€); State v. Bell, 233 N.W.2d 920 (Neb. 1975) (â€œa robbery is not completed at the moment the robber obtains possession of the stolen property . . . robbery includes the element of asportation, the robberâ€™s escape with the loot being considered as important in the commission of the crime as gaining possession of the property.â€); State v. Meyers, 620 So.2d 1160, 1163 (La. 1993) (â€œthe force or intimidation element of robbery is satisfied by evidence that force or intimidation directly related to the taking occurred in the course of completing the crime.â€); Ball v. State, 699 A.2d 1170 (Md.Â  1997) (â€œThe mere fact that some asportation has occurred before the use of force does not mean that the perpetrator is thereafter not guilty of the offense of robbery. . . . Â [When] the use of force enables the accused to retain possession of the property in the face of immediate resistance from the victim, then the taking is properly considered a robbery.â€); People v. Bartowsheski, 661 P.2d 235 (Colo. 1983) (â€œThe gravamen of robbery is the application of physical force or intimidation against the victim at any time during the course of a transaction culminating in the taking of property from the victimâ€™s person or presence. Â There is no requirement that the application of force or intimidation must be virtually contemporaneous with the taking.â€); Commonwealth. v. Rajotte, 499 N.E.2d 313 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986) (â€œA larceny may be converted into a robbery if . . . an assault is committed on a person who, having some protective concern for the goods taken interferes with the completion of the theft.â€).\r\n3. A TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD\r\nCiting the Tennessee case of State v. Owens, 20 S.W.3d 634 (Tenn. 2000), Moore urges this court to hold that robbery requires the act of violence or intimidation â€œprecede or be concomitant to or contemporaneous with the taking of the property.â€Â  See also State v. Hope, 345 S.E.2d 361, 364 (N.C. 1986) (â€œto be found guilty of armed robbery, the defendantâ€™s use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon must precede or be concomitant with the taking, or be so joined with it in a continuous transaction by time and circumstances as to be inseparable.â€). Â Â \r\nA priori the reasoning and analysis in Owens is bottomed and premised upon the minority view in this country.Â  Owens plucks its rationale from a flawed and defective academic exercise.Â  The minority view does not give any credence to the criminal activity in totality.Â  Rather, the minority rule restricts and insulates the criminal activity to the zone of coinstantaneous and synchronous conduct.Â  \r\n \r\nIn contrariety to Mooreâ€™s contention, the crime was not â€œcompleteâ€ prior to his confrontation with Hayes.Â  Hayes confronted Moore immediately after he walked out the front doors of the store but before he left the retailerâ€™s parking lot.Â  If not for Mooreâ€™s display of a handgun, Hayes would likely have been able to thwart the thief at that time.Â  However, while still standing on Wal-Martâ€™s grounds, Moore employed the weapon to threaten Hayes with force and create fear.Â  The gun allowed Moore to actually remove the merchandise from Wal-Martâ€™s domain.Â  Perspicuously, the threat of weapon was contemporaneous to and not separable with his taking of the goods from the premises of the merchant. Â \r\nSimplistically put, the requisite elements of larceny are met at the point when a thief possesses an item of stolen property.Â  See State v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 598, 325 S.E.2d 325, 326 (1985) (â€œasportation is an element of robbery and armed robbery.â€). Â However, Mooreâ€™s crime continued as he attempted his escape through the Wal-Mart parking lot, where his threat to Hayes raised the offense from larceny to armed robbery.Â  See Burko v. State, 313 A.2d 864, 71 (Md. App. 1974) vacated on other grounds, 422 U.S. 1003, 95 S.Ct. 2624, 45 L.Ed.2d 667 (1975) (â€œwhen one commits a larceny and then displays a weapon so as to overcome the resistance of the witness, the crime is then elevated to robberyâ€) (citing Clark and Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes, Â§ 12.09 (6th ed. Wingersky rev. 1958); Perkins, Criminal Law, ch. 4, Â§ 2C at 284 (2d ed. 1969).Â  At the point he was escaping through Wal-Martâ€™s parking lot, Mooreâ€™s asportation of the stolen property was luculently within the ambit and aegis of the doctrine of asportation, an indispensable element of the offense of armed robbery.Â  The striking similitude in the factual scenario depicted in Keith as juxtaposed to this factual record brings this court to the ineluctable conclusion that Moore committed the offense of armed robbery. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe adopt the continuous offense theory based on the efficacy and rationale of the doctrine and our supreme courtâ€™s decision in State v. Keith, 283 S.C. 597, 325 S.E.2d 325 (1985).Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not error in refusing to grant a directed verdict of acquittal.Â  Appellantâ€™s conviction for armed robbery is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4248","title":"Motley v.

Shealy, 370 S.C. 317, 322, 635 S.E.2d 76, 78 (2006); Galloway v. Regis Corp., 325 S.C. 541, 481 S.E.2d 714 (Ct. App. 1997); Kumar v. Third Generation, Inc., 324 S.C. 284, 485 S.E.2d 626 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  This requirement is provided by Rule 43(k) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Ashfort Corp. Palmetto Construction Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 493-94, 458 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1995) (â€œIn our opinion, Rule 43(k) is applicable to settlement agreements.â€); Widewater Square Assocs. v. Opening Break of America, Inc., 319 S.C. 243, 245, 460 S.E.2d 396, (1995) (â€œa settlement order is unenforceable where it fails to set forth the terms of the settlement as required by Rule 43(k), SCRCP.â€); Reed v. Associated Invs. of Edisto Island, Inc., 339 S.C. 148, 528 S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The rule states:\r\n\r\n\tAgreements of Counsel. No agreement between counsel affecting the proceedings in an action shall be binding unless reduced to the form of a consent order or written stipulation signed by counsel and entered in the record, or unless made in open court and noted upon the record. Â Settlement agreements shall be handled in accordance with Rule 41.1, SCRCP.\r\n\r\nRule 43(k), SCRCP.Â   \r\nâ€œLike former Circuit Court Rule 14 on which it is based, Rule 43(k) is intended to prevent disputes as to the existence and terms of agreements regarding pending litigation.â€Â  Ashfort at 493-94, 458 S.E.2d at 534.Â  â€œ[A]pplication of Rule 43(k) will increase the certainty of settlement agreements by avoiding disputes.Â  Id. at 494-95, 458 S.E.2d at 535.\r\n2.Â  ATTORNEY/CLIENT CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP\r\nIt is a long-standing and well-settled rule that an attorney may settle litigation on behalf of his client and that the client is bound by his attorneyâ€™s settlement actions.Â  See Crowley v. Harvey &amp; Battey, P.A., 327 S.C. 68, 488 S.E.2d 334 (1997); Shelton v. Bressant, 312 S.C. 183, 439 S.E.2d 833, (1993); Poore v. Poore, 105 S.C. 206, 89 S.E. 569 (1915); Arnold v. Yarborough, 281 S.C. 570, 572 316 S.E.2d 416, 417 (Ct. App. 1984). Â â€œThis rule is based on the principles of agency law.â€Â  Crowley at 70, 488 S.E.2d at 335.\r\n\r\n\tIt will never do, in the absence of fraud, to allow the undoubted attorneys of record for a party to a suit to enter into a solemn agreement to settle and adjust the issues and subject-matter of a suit and then later, if it is done, because for any reason the party is dissatisfied, to allow him to repudiate this agreement and employ different counsel to upset and set aside what his first counsel has done.\r\n\r\nPoore at 211-12, 89 S.E. at 571.\r\nâ€œActs of an attorney are directly attributable to and binding upon the client.Â  Absent fraud or mistake, where attorneys of record for a party agree to settle a case, the party cannot later repudiate the agreement.â€Â  Shelton at 184, 439 S.E.2d at 834 (quoting Arnold v. Yarborough, 281 S.C. 570, 572 316 S.E.2d 416, 417 (Ct. App. 1984)).Â  This court has held:\r\n\r\n\t[E]mployment of an attorney in a particular suit implies his clientâ€™s assent that he may do everything which the court may approve in the progress of the cause. Â Upon this distinction in a large measure rest the certainty, verity, and finality of every judgment of a court. Â Litigants must necessarily be held bound by the acts of their attorneys in the conduct of a cause in court, in the absence, of course, of fraud.\r\n\r\nArnold at 572, 316 S.E. at 417 (quoting Ex parte Jones, 47 S.C. 393, 397, 25 S.E. 285, 286 (1896)).\r\nAny communication failure or mistake on the part of an attorney is directly attributable to his client.Â  See Kirkland v. Moseley, 109 S.C. 477, 96 S.E. 608 (1917) (a party cannot set aside settlement agreement signed pursuant to attorneyâ€™s erroneous legal advice); see also Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 451, 248 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1978) (â€œThe general rule in this jurisdiction is that the neglect of the attorney is attributable to the client.â€).Â  Relief from such an error rests in an action against the lawyer:\r\n\r\n\t[I]f the attorney has apparent authority to confess, or consent to, judgment, it is ordinarily binding and conclusive on the client, notwithstanding an actual lack of authority unknown to the court or the opposing party, the sole remedy in such a case being against the attorney.\r\n\r\nLord Jeff Knitting Co., Inc. v. Mills, 281 S.C. 374, 377, 315 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing 7A C.J.S. Attorney &amp; Client Â§ 200 at 332 (1980); Poore at 212, 89 S.E. at 569); see also Crowley at 70, 488 S.E.2d at 335 (â€œwhere a client alleges his former attorney was negligent in advising him to accept a settlement, that alleged negligence is not a ground for attacking the settlement itself but rather is a matter left for a malpractice suit between the client and his attorney.â€).\r\nIn Shelton v. Bressant, 312 S.C. 183, 439 S.E.2d 833 (1993), the appellant and his attorney appeared in open court and advised the presiding judge they had been able to settle their case with the opposing party.Â  The following day, an oral agreement between the two sides was tape-recorded and subsequently transcribed.Â  Shortly thereafter, the appellant attempted to repudiate the settlement agreement, contending it failed to meet his terms.Â  Our supreme court found the agreement binding and held:\r\n\r\n\t[Appellantsâ€™] contention that the suit was not settled according to his instructions does not entitle him to rescind the agreement.\r\n\tWhen a litigant voluntarily accepts an offer of settlement, either directly or indirectly through the duly authorized actions of his attorney, the integrity of the settlement cannot be attacked on the basis of inadequate representation by the litigantâ€™s attorney. Â In such cases, any remaining dispute is purely between the party and his attorney.\r\n\r\nId. at 185, 439 S.E.2d at 834 (citing Petty v. The Timken Corp., 849 F.2d 130, 133 (4th Cir.1988) (emphasis removed from original).\r\nIn his brief to this court, Williams asserts that he â€œrepeatedly instructed his attorney not to settle the case under any circumstances . . . .â€Â  However, during the hearing before the master, his attorney did in fact settle the case and did so directly in Williamsâ€™ presence.Â  Williams makes no claim of fraud, and offers simply that mistake existed.Â  Although he compares the issue with contract doctrine, stating â€œthere was no meeting of the minds in regard to the settlement agreement,â€ the exact cause of and parties involved in this alleged mistake are never fully articulated.Â  Williams argues: â€œ[N]o one ever explained to Mr. Williams to what he was agreeing, nor did anyone ask.Â  Because of his lack of education and experience with the court system, he was completely confused as to what was transpiring in the courtroom.â€\r\nUndoubtedly, Williams was, or should have been, well apprised that his attorney was entering into a settlement agreement.Â  As detailed in the record:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCOURT: \r\n\t\t\t. . . Both parties are present \r\n\t\t\ttoday.&nbsp; The Plaintiff is represented by George W. Speedy of the \r\n\t\t\tKershaw County Bar, and the Defendant is represented by Roderick M. \r\n\t\t\tTodd of the Kershaw County.&nbsp; I did briefly discuss this matter \r\n\t\t\twith the attorneys prior to the commencement of this proceeding, and \r\n\t\t\tI understand the parties have reached a settlement in this matter; \r\n\t\t\tis that correct, Mr. Speedy?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY:\r\n\t\t\tThat is correct, Your Honor.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCOURT:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIf one of you would advise me of \r\n\t\t\twhat it is.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY:\r\n\t\t\tYes, Your Honor. . . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAnd I believe that is the agreement of the parties.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTODD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tEach party will be responsible for their own costs. . . .&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCOURT: \r\n\t\t\tDid you want to question either \r\n\t\t\tof your parties?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY: \r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s necessary.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tI just wanted to put it on the record, and we are good to go.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCOURT:\r\n\t\t\tOkay. &nbsp;Well, having heard the \r\n\t\t\tagreement in open Court, I am glad that the parties [] were able to \r\n\t\t\tresolve this matter between themselves privately without me having \r\n\t\t\tto make another difficult decision as is typically the case when \r\n\t\t\tcases make it to Court. . . .\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nÂ As such, the transcript of the proceeding decidedly and incontestably reflects Williamsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s consent to the settlement agreement.Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the record illustrates clarity as to nature and contents of the settlement.Â  More specifically, during the hearing, the judge and two attorneys comprehensively and conspicuously laid out the manner in which the land at issue was to be divided between Motley and Williams:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY:\r\n\t\t\t. . . We have agreed to equally \r\n\t\t\tdivide that parcel of property, and we have agreed to divide it - - \r\n\t\t\thow would you determine it - - - \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTODD: \r\n\t\t\tSuch that Mr. Motley would \r\n\t\t\treceive the parcel closest to land now or formerly Loblolly which \r\n\t\t\tlooks to be on the eastern side of the property.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY: \r\n\t\t\tThatâ€™s right.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTODD:\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAnd Mr. Williams \r\n\t\t\twould receive, of course, the other half on the western side.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCOURT:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAnd if you would, just discuss \r\n\t\t\tfor me the access road of that parcel that would be cut off for the \r\n\t\t\tPlaintiff.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSPEEDY:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIt has access; thereâ€™s a deeded right-of-way across the property of Edward Evans.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAlthough simple, the agreement is nonetheless complete and thorough, calling for the 9.68 acre property to be divided in equal shares.Â  The arrangement clearly requires a line to be drawn from north to south through the center of the land, providing Motley with the eastern half and Williams with the remaining western portion. \r\n \r\nWhile Williams may at one time have had every intention of having the case tried, his attorney consented to a settlement before the court. Â His counsel presumptively possessed the authority to make such an agreement, particularly in light of the fact that Williams was present in the courtroom at that time.Â  Any mistake that may have occurred was solely a result of a communication breakdown between Williams and his attorney.Â  As prescribed by the law of this state, Williams is bound by the actions of his lawyer. Â Â Â \r\nWilliams claims the trial court erred in not questioning the parties during the initial hearing nor requiring affidavits in deciding his motion to set aside the order.Â  He alleges the settlement agreement read into the record fails to meet the requirements of SCRCP 43(k) because it lacks the required specificity as to the terms of the agreement.Â  These issues were never raised before the master, and we therefore decline to rule on their merits, as they are not preserved for review.

City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); see also Iâ€˜On, L.L.C v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4249\r\nHeard April 5, 2007 â€“ Filed May 31, 2007\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tW. Allen Reese, of Greer, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAnthony H. Randall, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  In this probate action, Jody Carroll appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing and remanding to the probate court the issue of whether Edward Ray Patterson breached the general warranty in his deed to Carroll.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nPatterson owned 1.15 acres of property (the Property) in Greenville County.Â  On May 6, 2002, he conveyed 5,128 square feet of the Property to the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) for $12,000.Â  However, SCDOT improperly recorded the deed in Spartanburg County.Â  On March 31, 2003, Patterson conveyed the Property to Carroll by general warranty deed without mentioning the prior conveyance to SCDOT.Â \r\n \r\nPatterson died on December 6, 2003.Â  Subsequently, Carroll filed a claim against Pattersonâ€™s estate (the Estate) for monetary damages for breach of the deedâ€™s general warranty.Â  The Estate disallowed this claim, and the case was tried in the probate court.Â  At trial, the Estate argued Patterson did not breach his general warranty to Carroll because Carroll could claim paramount title against SCDOT as a subsequent purchaser for value without notice.Â  Carroll maintains he may elect to sue Patterson for breach of the warranty rather than asserting paramount title with respect to SCDOT.[1]Â   \r\nThe probate court held Patterson breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment and awarded Carroll the value of the 5,128 square feet conveyed to SCDOT.Â  The Estate appealed to the circuit court, which reversed and remanded.Â  The circuit court held the probate court properly found Carroll entitled to damages but erred in refusing to consider the priority of Carrollâ€™s title with respect to SCDOT.Â  For this reason, the circuit court held, sua sponte, that SCDOT was an indispensable party and should be joined on remand.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for the breach of a deed warranty is one at law.Â  Welsh v. Davis, 37 S.C. 215 (1872).Â  On appeal from an action at law, the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses that no evidence supports them.Â  Neely v. Thomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 349-50, 618 S.E.2d 884, 886&nbsp;(2005). Questions of law may, however, be decided by this court without deference to the lower court. Â Mariarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).Â Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCarroll contends the circuit court erred in refusing to hold he may maintain his breach of deed warranty action against the Estate despite his ability to assert a claim of paramount title against SCDOT.Â  Because Patterson breached the covenant of seisin in his deed to Carroll, we agree.\r\nPreliminarily, we note the probate court technically erred in finding Patterson breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment contained in the deed to Carroll.Â  However, the probate courtâ€™s ruling is substantively correct because Patterson breached the deedâ€™s covenant of seisin.Â  In addition, the issue tried by the parties was whether Patterson breached the general warranty in the deed.Â  Accordingly, we hold the probate courtâ€™s error did not prejudice either party and forms no basis for reversal.\r\nIn Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 592, 635 S.E.2d 649, 656&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006), this court explained:\r\n\r\n\tA South Carolina general warranty deed embraces all of the following five covenants usually inserted in fee simple conveyances by English conveyors: (1) that the seller is seized in fee; (2) that he has a right to convey; (3) that the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall quietly enjoy the land; (4) that the land is free from all encumbrances; and (5) for further assurances.\r\n\r\n(quoting Martin v. Floyd, 282 S.C. 47, 51, 317 S.E.2d 133, 136&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984)).\r\nThe covenant of seisin is the grantorâ€™s covenant that he owns title to the property being conveyed.Â  See Johnson v. Veal, 14 S.C.L. (3 McCord) 449, 450 (Ct. App. 1826) (â€œ[I]t has been held that under a general warranty of title the purchaser may maintain an action against the grantor before eviction if he can shew [sic] that he had no title at the time of sale.â€); 21 C.J.S. Covenants Â§ 16 (2006) (â€œThe covenant of seisin is the grantorâ€™s promise that he or she owns the property interest he or she purports to convey to the grantee.â€); 20 Am.Jur.2d Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions Â§ 82 (2005) (â€œThe covenant of seisin is a promise that the grantor has good title to the estate which he or she is purporting to convey.â€).Â \r\n \r\nOn the other hand, â€œ[t]he covenant of quiet enjoyment obligates the grantor to protect the estate against the lawful claim of ownership asserted by a third person.â€Â  Martin, 282 S.C. at 51, 317 S.E.2d at 136.Â  However, â€œ[n]o breach of this covenant occurs until there has been a disturbance of possession by actual or constructive eviction.â€ Â Id. at 51, 317 S.E.2d at 136.Â  \r\n \r\nIn this case, the probate court held Patterson breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment, but the Estate correctly recognizes Carroll has not been evicted because he voluntarily surrendered his right to claim title against SCDOT.Â  See 21 C.J.S. Covenants (2006) (â€œEven if there has been a claim of title asserted by a third party and the grantee surrendered title because of it, that will not establish a breach of covenants in a warranty deed unless the third party actually holds superior title.â€). Accordingly, the probate court erred in finding Patterson breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment.\r\nHowever, the probate courtâ€™s substantive ruling is correct because Patterson breached his covenant of seisin at the time he conveyed the Property to Carroll.Â  Moreover, the Estate is not prejudiced by the technical error because the parties litigated the issue of whether Patterson breached the covenant of seisin.Â  Carrollâ€™s claim against the Estate generally alleged a breach of deed warranty and did not specify that only the covenant of quiet enjoyment had been breached.Â \r\n \r\nWhile Carroll failed to specify the breach as a breach of the covenant of seisin, we recognize â€œ[a] party need not use the exact name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve it . . .â€Â  State v. Dunbar&nbsp; 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694&nbsp;(2003).Â  Further, the Estateâ€™s appeal to the circuit court merely alleged error in the probate courtâ€™s general ruling that Patterson breached the deed warranty.Â  \r\n \r\nHaving determined Patterson breached his covenant of seisin, we proceed to the issue of whether Carroll could elect to claim damages for that breach rather than instituting an action claiming superior title to the tract against SCDOT.Â  We hold the circuit court erred in ruling Carroll could not litigate his claim against the Estate rather than attempting to assert paramount title against SCDOT.Â \r\n \r\nA breach of the covenant of seisin arises at the time of the conveyance and supports an action against the grantor prior to actual or constructive eviction.Â  See Lessly v. Bowie,&nbsp;27 S.C. 193, 198, 3 S.E. 199, 201&nbsp;(1887) (recognizing the breach of a covenant that the vendor is seized in fee â€œwas as old as the deed itself, and as it has been held, would have supported an original action at law for damages, even before eviction.â€); 14 Powell on Real Property Â§ 81A.06[2][a][iv] (2005) (â€œ[The covenant of seisin] is broken, if at all, at the time of the conveyance . . . . It is not necessary that the grantee actually be evicted from the premises in order for the cause of action to accrue.â€).Â  Consequently, Carroll had the ability to file suit on the breach at the time Patterson delivered the deed without regard to whether Carroll was evicted or could be evicted.\r\nHere, the circuit courtâ€™s order presupposes that the probate court must make a finding of eviction before allowing Carroll to proceed with his claim against the Estate.Â  However, as we have explained, Pattersonâ€™s covenant of seisin was breached when he conveyed the Property to Carroll regardless of whether an eviction occurred.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is reversed and remanded for entry of an order consistent herewith.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[2]\r\n \r\nBEATTY, J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Carroll testified at trial that he acquiesced to SCDOTâ€™s ownership of the area it claimed. Moreover, at oral argument before this court, Carrollâ€™s counsel waived any right he may have to pursue a claim against SCDOT.\r\n[2] Based on this decision, we need not address Carrollâ€™s other issues on appeal.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appealâ€); Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711&nbsp;(2005) (recognizing appellate courts need not address the remaining issues when one issue is dispositive).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4250","title":"State v.

Â Officer Kevin Smith notified Officer John Sherfield, a narcotics officer.Â  Sherfield went to the jail and met with Informant.Â  Informant told Officer Sherfield he and Joshua Willard were related, that Informant had purchased drugs from Willard in the past, and he intended to purchase drugs from Willard that day.Â  Informant agreed to set up the buy and Officer Sherfield agreed to â€œtry to helpâ€ Informant on his drug charge in exchange for his cooperation.Â  Informant and Willard had not set a meeting place for the buy and Officer Sherfield directed Informant to arrange for the meeting to take place at a local movie theater parking lot. Â \r\nUsing Sherfieldâ€™s mobile telephone, Informant called Willard.Â  A transcription of the conversation was introduced into evidence:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWillard:\r\n\t\t\tHello.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tInformant:\r\n\t\t\tHey.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWillard:\r\n\t\t\tYo.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tInformant: \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWhatâ€™s up man?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWillard:&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWhatâ€™s up?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tInformant: \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. . .

Â Sherfield admitted there was a magistrate on duty at the courthouse in the same location at the time.Â  However, Sherfield believed he had reasonable suspicion to search Willardâ€™s car and question him without a warrant from the magistrate. Â \r\nLater that day, Officer Kitchens radioed Sherfield and told him he had spotted Willard within a half mile of the movie theater.Â  Sherfieldâ€™s mobile phone rang, reporting a call from the number Informant called earlier.Â  Sherfield did not answer.Â  Constable Billy Bennett arrived at the theater in a green pickup truck.Â  Kitchens was in the parking lot and watched Willard drive into the parking lot.Â  Officer Smith also pulled into the parking lot. Â Sherfield pulled in and the four officers converged on Willardâ€™s car, blocking it in.Â  Informant was not present, as he had already been booked and incarcerated. Â \r\nKitchens testified he asked Willard and the other occupant of his vehicle, a male, to exit the car.Â  After the men exited the car, Sherfield explained their rights to them.Â  Sherfield asked Willard â€œwhere the drugs were.â€Â  Willard denied any knowledge of drugs.Â  Sherfield held up his mobile phone and said â€œyou (sic) been calling my phone.â€Â  Willard â€œdropped his head and said theyâ€™re in the console . . . .â€Â  Kitchens approached the vehicle and found 17.46 grams of methamphetamine, digital scales, and $1,012 in cash.Â  \r\nAt trial, the court heard pre-trial motions, including Willardâ€™s motion to suppress the drugs.Â  Officers Sherfield and Kitchens testified.Â  The court denied the motion finding, inter alia, Willard consented to the search.Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\n    In criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only. Therefore, an appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  The same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Our review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500-01 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWillard argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the drugs as the product of an unlawful search.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œ[t]he right of the people to be secure . . . [from] unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  A warrantless search generally offends the Fourth Amendment.Â  State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 456, 462 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1995).Â  A warrantless search withstands constitutional scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment if it meets the requirements of one of several exceptions, including the automobile exception.Â  Id.Â  â€œAs a general matter, the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.Â  The police, however, may also stop and briefly detain a vehicle if they have a reasonable suspicion that the occupants are involved in criminal activity.â€Â  State v. Butler, 343 S.C. 198, 201, 539 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 2000) (internal citations omitted).\r\nâ€œâ€˜Reasonable suspicionâ€™ requires a â€˜particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect another of criminal activity.â€™â€Â  State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 69, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2002) (quoting United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981)).Â  In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances.Â  State v. Rogers, 368 S.C. 529, 534, 629 S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Reasonable suspicion is more than a general hunch but less than what is required for probable cause.Â  Butler, 343 S.C. at 202, 539 S.E.2d at 416.\r\nIn State v. Green, this court held an anonymous telephone tip provided insufficient indicia of reliability to justify an investigatory stop.Â  341 S.C. 214, 218, 532 S.E.2d 896, 897 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  However, in State v. Rogers, this court found a stop based on a known, reliable, confidential informant sufficient to meet the reasonable suspicion standard.Â  368 S.C. at 535, 629 S.E.2d at 682.Â  We find this case meets the criteria of Rogers.Â  Although the informant in this case was not previously proven reliable, as in Rogers, he was more than a mere tipster.Â  The informant correctly identified Willardâ€™s vehicle, knew Willardâ€™s telephone number, and mentioned drugs during the conversation with Willard.Â  Although the informantâ€™s reliability had not previously been tested, a non-confidential informant is given a higher level of credibility because he exposes himself to liability should the information prove to be false.Â  See State v. Bellamy, 323 S.C. 199, 204, 473 S.E.2d 838, 841 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  We thus find support to affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding of reasonable suspicion for the stop.Â  \r\nWe likewise find the requisite exigent circumstances for a warrantless search, arising from mobility, as required under California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386 (1985).Â  In Carney, the court upheld the warrantless search of a lawfully parked but fully mobile motor home under the automobile exception.Â  471 U.S. at 395.Â  Willard argues because the officers surrounded his vehicle, it was not â€œmobileâ€ under Carney.Â  However, temporary immobility may still be considered readily mobile so as to qualify for the automobile exception.Â  See Myers v. State, 839 N.E.2d 1146, 1152 (Ind. 2005) (cases cited therein).\r\nIn any event, we find Willard voluntarily consented to the search.[1]Â  â€œWarrantless searches and seizures are reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when conducted under the authority of voluntary consent.â€Â  Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 514, 511 S.E.2d 62, 66 (1999).Â  â€œUndoubtedly, a law enforcement officer may request permission to search at any time. Â However, when an officer asks for consent to search after an unconstitutional detention, the consent procured is per se invalid unless it is both voluntary and not an exploitation of the unlawful detention.â€Â  State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 105, 623 S.E.2d 840, 851 (Ct. App. 2005) (emphasis in original).Â  Whether consent to a search is voluntary is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances.Â  State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 656, 576 S.E.2d 168, 179 (2003).Â  \r\nWe find evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that the consent was voluntary.Â  Willardâ€™s consent to search was obtained after Officer Sherfield read Willard his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).Â  Willard consented to the search by nodding his head toward the vehicle and telling the officers the drugs were in the console, after notification of the calls to Sherfieldâ€™s mobile phone.Â  \r\nWe likewise find the search was not an exploitation of an unlawful detention.Â  As previously discussed, we find reasonable suspicion existed to make the stop and detention.Â  Furthermore, although Willard allegedly noticed the officersâ€™ guns when first surrounded, there is no evidence of any threat of force against Willard once he had exited his vehicle.Â  Nor is there evidence of coercion or promises made.Â  After review of all the circumstances, we find no error by the trial court in denying Willardâ€™s motion to suppress the drugs.Â  See Green, 341 S.C. at 219 n.3, 532 S.E.2d at 898 n.3Â  (holding â€œthe appellate standard of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding and the appellate court may only reverse where there is clear error.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although the State argues this issue is not preserved for appellate review as not raised on appeal, we find sufficient argument in Willardâ€™s brief to address the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
