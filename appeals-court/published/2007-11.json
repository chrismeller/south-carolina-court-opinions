Goldsmith, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4279\r\nHeard June 5, 2007 â€“ Filed July 26, 2007\r\nWithdrawn, Substituted and Refiled\r\nNovember 2, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John Martin Foster, of Rock Hill, for\r\n          Appellants.\r\n        James R.

judgment against them.Â  The Shores contend the judgment\r\n  was void, the judgment lacked active energy because it was more than ten years\r\n  old, there was an accord and satisfaction of the debt, and the Linda Mc Company\r\n  (the Company) should be estopped from denying the accord and satisfaction.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nI.\r\nOn December 8, 1994, the Shores agreed to\r\n  give the Company a judgment by confession (the Judgment) as settlement of\r\n  litigation over unpaid sales commissions.Â  The Judgment was entered on June 2,\r\n  1995, and provided in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  [The Shores] confess judgment to [the Company] in the amount\r\n    of $110,000.00 and hereby authorize the Clerk of Court for Lancaster County,\r\n    South Carolina, to enter judgment in favor of [the Company] against [the\r\n    Shores], jointly and severally, for such amount, plus such costs and reasonable\r\n    attorneysâ€™ fees incurred by [the Company] in enforcing the unconditional\r\n    guaranty, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (the â€œGuarantyâ€). . .\r\n    .\r\n  2.Â  [The Shores] agree that [the Company] may immediately, by\r\n    affidavit through its attorneys, set forth the correct amount of this Judgment\r\n    by adjusting the amount stated above for any credits previously applied by [the\r\n    Company], and that [the Company] may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction\r\n    for a judgment against [the Shores], jointly and severally, in the amount of\r\n    the total sum due and owing hereunder, plus costs and reasonable attorneysâ€™\r\n    fees incurred by [the Company] in enforcing the Guaranty, without further\r\n    notice to [the Shores] and without further authority from [the Shores];\r\n    provided, however, that in no event may said sum exceed $110,000.00, plus costs\r\n    and reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees incurred by [the Company] in enforcing the\r\n    Guaranty.Â  [The Shores] authorize the entry of judgment for the amount due and\r\n    owing as set out in the affidavit, which judgment will continue to bear\r\n    interest at the highest legal rate permitted by law.Â  The Judgment by\r\n    Confession is not contingent upon any other considerations or proceedings and\r\n    the Court is authorized to enter judgment for the amount set forth in the\r\n    affidavit.\r\n\r\nSometime\r\n  after the Judgment was entered, the Shores paid the Company $55,000.Â  On\r\n  February 20, 2004, the Company wrote a letter (the Agreement) to the Shores\r\n  wherein it agreed to waive all post-judgment interest if the Company received\r\n  the remaining $55,000 before May 7, 2004.Â  The Shores paid the Company $26,750\r\n  by check dated May 13, 2004.Â  Â Â \r\nThe sheriff sought to execute on the\r\n  Judgment, but as is customary, the execution was returned nulla bona.[1]Â  On July 29, 2004, the Company filed\r\n  a petition for supplemental proceedings.Â  The Company countered that the Shores\r\n  possessed assets subject to execution on the Judgment.Â  On August 3, 2004, the\r\n  Shores issued a check to the Company in the amount of $28,500.Â  The\r\n  trial court granted the Companyâ€™s petition for supplemental proceedings on\r\n  August 9, 2004, and referred the matter to a special referee.Â  \r\nOn October 1, 2004, the referee conducted\r\n  a hearing to determine whether the Shores had any assets that could be used to\r\n  satisfy the remaining balance on the Judgment.Â  Prior to the hearing, the Shores\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, asserting in part that\r\n  the Judgment was void for lack of an affidavit.Â  The motion was denied on December 1, 2004, as the referee\r\n  concluded the Judgment was valid and enforceable.Â  \r\nOn May 24, 2005, the referee conducted an additional hearing at\r\n  which the Shores asserted the Agreement had been modified by a phone message\r\n  Jan left at the Companyâ€™s attorneyâ€™s office.Â  This phone message, according to\r\n  the Shores, constituted an accord and satisfaction of the debt.Â  In particular, Jan testified that in May\r\n  2004 she left the Companyâ€™s attorney two messages explaining the Shores were\r\n  sending half of the amount due and â€œif there was any problem with thatâ€ to call\r\n  her and she would â€œget the other half put together.â€Â  In the message,\r\n  she also stated she would pay the outstanding amount at the end of the next\r\n  quarter, meaning July or August.Â  Additionally, the Shores introduced their\r\n  phone records showing a call lasting two minutes was placed to the Companyâ€™s attorney\r\n  on May 13, 2004.Â  The Companyâ€™s attorney testified that although his\r\n  secretary checked and logged his messages, she would often not include the\r\n  content of the messages.Â  He recalled receiving a couple of phone calls\r\n  from the Shores but did not know what they were about and never called the\r\n  Shores back.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Judgment was subject to execution and levy until June 2, 2005.Â  On June 3,\r\n  2005, the referee issued his report to the circuit court finding there had been\r\n  no accord and satisfaction.Â  The referee also found the Shores owed interest\r\n  outstanding from the entry of the Judgment to date, as well as costs and\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On the same day, June 3, the circuit court issued an\r\n  order to execute and levy.Â  The Shores did not raise the matter of the Judgmentâ€™s\r\n  expiration in the trial court.Â  On June 24, 2005, three weeks after the\r\n  Judgment expired, the Shores filed a notice of appeal.Â  \r\nII.\r\nA.Â  Validity of the\r\n  Judgment \r\nThe\r\n  Shores argue that because the Company failed to follow the terms of paragraph 2\r\n  in the Judgment to fix the amount of Judgment by affidavit, its filing was void\r\n  and the court was without jurisdiction. Â We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe Judgment complies with the statutory requirements\r\n  of section 15-35-360 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  This section provides:\r\n\r\n  Before a judgment by confession shall be entered a\r\n    statement in writing must be made and signed by the defendant and verified by\r\n    his oath to the following effect: (1) It must state the amount for\r\n    which judgment may be entered and authorize the entry of judgment therefor; (2) If it be for the money due\r\n    or to become due, it must state concisely the facts out of which it arose and\r\n    must show that the sum confessed therefor is justly due or to become due; and (3) If it be for the purpose of\r\n    securing the plaintiff against a contingent liability, it must state concisely\r\n    the facts constituting the liability and must show that the\r\n    sum confessed therefor does not exceed the liability.\r\n\r\nThe Judgment sets forth that the Shores owe â€œ$110,000, plus costs\r\n  and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees incurred by Plaintiff in enforcing the\r\n  Guaranty.â€Â  The Judgment was made in writing and signed by the Shores and\r\n  verified by their oath.Â  Post-judgment interest accrued as a matter of law.Â  The\r\n  Judgment satisfies the statutory requirements.\r\nThe\r\n  Shoresâ€™ argument centers on the fact that the Company never filed the affidavit\r\n  setting forth the amount of Judgment specified in paragraph 2 of the Judgment.Â \r\n  The language pertaining to the affidavit, however, is permissive and not\r\n  mandatory; it states an affidavit may be filed.Â  Further, the failure to\r\n  file the affidavit does not render the Judgment void as contemplated by Rule\r\n  60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(b)(4) provides the court may relieve a party or his legal\r\n  representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding if the judgment is\r\n  void.Â  â€œThe definition of â€˜voidâ€™ under the rule\r\n  only encompasses judgments from courts which failed to provide proper due\r\n  process, or judgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or\r\n  personal jurisdiction.â€Â  McDaniel v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,324 S.C. 639,\r\n  644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  The absence of an affidavit has no bearing on the subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction of the court.Â  The referee properly concluded that the Judgment\r\n  was not void. \r\nB.Â  Filing of Judgment\r\n  Within Ten Years\r\nThe\r\n  Shores argue because the ten-year period expired on June 2, 2005, section\r\n  15-39-30 deprives the Judgment of active energy, thereby rendering the June 3,\r\n  2005 order ineffective.Â  This argument was not presented to the trial court,\r\n  and we find the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal,\r\n  it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional\r\n  circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).\r\nApplication\r\n  of issue preservation principles may appear harsh under these circumstances,\r\n  for the Shoresâ€™ ability to challenge the ten-year limitation period did not\r\n  arise until the statutory period ran on June 2, 2005.Â  Yet the Shores had the\r\n  opportunity to raise the defense in a motion to amend their pleadings or a\r\n  motion to alter, amend or vacate and did not do so.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  believe this courtâ€™s opinion in LaRosa v. Johnston, 328 S.C. 293, 493\r\n  S.E.2d 100 (Ct. App. 1997), requires us to dispose of this challenge on issue\r\n  preservation principles.[2]Â  In LaRosa, the\r\n  judgment was entered on March 11, 1986.Â  328 S.C. at 295, 493 S.E.2d at 101.Â \r\n  Supplemental proceedings were instituted prior to the expiration of the\r\n  ten-year period set forth in section 15-39-30;\r\n  however, the trial court signed an order in connection with collection of the\r\n  judgment on March 15, 1996.Â  Id. at 296, 493 S.E.2d at 101.Â  The clerk\r\n  filed the order on March 18, 1996.Â  Id.Â  As we observed, â€œStarting on\r\n  March 11, 1986, the judgment was good until March 11, 1996.â€Â  328 S.C. at 297,\r\n  493 S.E.2d at 102.Â  Following the March 18, 1996 order, Johnston moved to\r\n  â€œalter, amend, and vacate [the trial courtâ€™s order], because LaRosaâ€™s judgment\r\n  against Johnston expired on March 11, 1996â€”ten years after the judgment was\r\n  filed.â€Â  Id. at 296, 493 S.E.2d at 101.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion and we reversed, holding the judgment expired on March 11, 1996.Â  Id. at 300, 493 S.E.2d at 103.\r\nIt\r\n  appears that LaRosa objected to the court considering a defense not included in\r\n  the pleadings.Â  We rejected LaRosaâ€™s argument: â€œWhen the judgment expired, Johnston acquired a statutory defense that had previously been unavailable.Â  We are not going\r\n  to penalize Johnston for failing to raise a defense which she could not have\r\n  raised.â€Â  Id. at 297, 493 S.E.2d at 102.Â  The point is that Johnston did assert the statutory defense as soon as it became available by way of\r\n  a motion to alter.Â  Because the statutory defense was brought to the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s attention as soon as the defense became available, the trial court\r\n  addressed the very issue that was subsequently challenged on appeal.\r\nAt\r\n  oral argument, the Shores took the position that the expiration of ten-year\r\n  time limit on judgments impacts subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Thus, according\r\n  to the Shores, this issue may be raised at any timeâ€”even for the first time on\r\n  appeal.Â  The Shores do not, however, cite authority for this argument.Â  We can\r\n  find no South Carolina case law to support the Shoresâ€™ argument that this is an\r\n  issue of subject matter jurisdiction, and this court in LaRosa and A\r\n    Fast Photo Express certainly did not treat the ten-year time limit on\r\n  judgments in section 15-39-30 as jurisdictional.\r\nWe\r\n  find further support for our holding today in a recent decision from our\r\n  supreme court.Â  In Lever v. Lighting Galleries, Inc., 374 S.C. 30, 31,\r\n  647 S.E.2d 214, 215 (2007), Lever borrowed money from Lighting Galleries in\r\n  1988.Â  The debt was secured by a Note, together with a mortgage on property\r\n  Lever owned in Aiken County.Â  Id.Â  When Lever failed to pay Lighting\r\n  Galleries in accordance with the partiesâ€™ agreement, Lighting Galleries brought\r\n  suit on the note and obtained a judgment in April 1989.Â  Id.Â  â€œLighting\r\n  Galleries was unable to collect on its judgment, which expired ten years later,\r\n  in April 1999.â€Â  Id. at 32, 647 S.E.2d at 215.Â  After the judgment\r\n  lienâ€™s expiration, Lever brought an action arguing that the expired judgment on\r\n  the note barred a foreclosure action.Â  Id. at 32, 647 S.E.2d at 215-16.Â \r\n  The court rejected Leverâ€™s argument: â€œWe hold that Lighting Galleries\r\n  may pursue a foreclosure action notwithstanding its judgment against Lever was\r\n  extinguished by virtue of the statute of limitations.â€Â  Id. at 36, 647\r\n  S.E.2d at 218.Â  Thus, our supreme court construes the ten-year time limit on\r\n  judgments in section 15-39-30 as a statute of limitations.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  appears to be the prevailing law across the country, for in our research, we\r\n  have found that other jurisdictions treat enactments similar to section\r\n  15-39-30 as statutes of limitations on judgments.Â  See 47 Am. Jur. 2d. Judgments Â§ 781 (2006) (â€œA judgment creditor generally has the right to bring an action\r\n  on the judgment at any time after its rendition, until barred by an applicable\r\n  statute of limitations.â€); see also, e.g., Elliott v.\r\n    Estate of Elliott, 596 S.E.2d 819, 821 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (â€œNorth\r\n  Carolina imposes a ten-year statute of limitations upon the enforcement of a\r\n  judgment or decree of any court of the United States.â€); Allied Funding v. Huemmer, 626\r\n  A.2d 1055, 1060-61 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1993) (holding\r\n  the twelve-year â€œstatute of limitationsâ€ began to run when the confessed\r\n  judgment was entered and barred a subsequent suit); Cottrill v. Cottrill, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 609, 612-13 (W. Va. 2006) (noting\r\n  a statutory requirement to execute a judgment within a ten-year period is a\r\n  â€œstatute of limitationsâ€ and, therefore, an affirmative defense).Â  Because\r\n  section 15-39-30 operates as a statute of limitations, it constitutes a matter\r\n  of avoidance under Rule 8(c), SCRCP, and must be raised in the trial court when\r\n  the defense becomes available.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case before us, the Shores never raised this statutory defense to the trial\r\n  court by way of a motion to alter, amend, vacate or otherwise.Â \r\n  Consequently, we conclude the Shoresâ€™ newly asserted defense under section\r\n  15-39-30 is not preserved for appellate review.Â  We understand that our ruling\r\n  allows the underlying judgment to have active energy beyond the ten-year\r\n  statutory period, but our rejection of the Shoresâ€™ subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  argument and the concomitant application of issue preservation principles\r\n  compels the result we reach today.Â  \r\nC.Â  Accord and\r\n  Satisfaction\r\nThe\r\n  Shores maintain because the Company was aware of the Shoreâ€™s proposal to modify\r\n  the Agreement, the referee erred in finding there was no accord and\r\n  satisfaction.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nAn accord and satisfaction occurs when there is: (1)\r\n  an agreement to accept in discharge of an obligation something different from\r\n  that which the creditor is claiming or is entitled to receive; and (2) payment\r\n  of the consideration expressed in the new agreement. Tremont Constr. Co. v.\r\n    Dunlap, 310\r\n  S.C. 180, 182, 425 S.E.2d 792, 793 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Like any contract, an accord\r\n  and satisfaction requires a meeting of the minds.Â  Keels v. Pierce, 315 S.C. 339, 343, 433\r\n  S.E.2d 902, 905 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  The debtor must intend and make unmistakably clear the\r\n  payment tendered fully satisfies the creditorâ€™s demand and the creditor must\r\n  accept payment with the intention that it will operate as a satisfaction.Â  Tremont Constr. Co., 310 S.C. at 182, 425\r\n  S.E.2d at 793.Â  Without an agreement to discharge the obligation there can be no\r\n  accord, and without an accord there can be no satisfaction.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  Shores contend the Agreement and subsequent cashing of the late check created\r\n  an accord and satisfaction of the debt.Â  They further maintain the phone\r\n  messages left by Jan modified the Agreement to allow for the remaining payment\r\n  to be late.Â  The referee found there was no meeting of the minds.Â  The referee\r\n  further found the Shores did not comply with the terms of the Agreement because\r\n  the Shores made the outstanding $55,000.00 payment after the date called for in\r\n  the Agreement.Â  As a result, the referee found there was no accord and\r\n  satisfaction.Â  We find no error by the referee in this regard. \r\nD.Â  Estoppel\r\nThe\r\n  Shores argue the Company had a duty to respond to the Shoresâ€™ proposal to\r\n  modify the Agreement and failing that duty the Company is estopped from denying\r\n  the modification of the Agreement.Â  This argument was neither presented to nor\r\n  addressed by the trial court.Â  Consequently, it is not preserved for review on\r\n  appeal.Â  In re Michael H., 360 S.C. at\r\n  546, 602 S.E.2d at 732; Lucas, 359 S.C. at 510-11, 598 S.E.2d at 715.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Nulla bona is â€œa form of return by a sheriff\r\n  or constable upon an execution when the judgment debtor has no seizable\r\n  property within the jurisdiction.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1095 (7th ed.\r\n  1999).\r\n[2] Â A Fast Photo\r\n  Express, Inc. v.

Brown, and William Howard, Sr.,\r\n  all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Cecil and Jackie Brazell appeal the order of the circuit court\r\n  dismissing their request for the remedy of rescission.Â  The order was issued\r\n  following a motion made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 20, 2004, the Brazells\r\n  and Audrey Windsor entered into a contract for the purchase and sale of a home\r\n  located at 8509 Oyster Factory Road, Edisto Island, South Carolina.Â  The\r\n  parties agreed that the closing date would be November 30, 2004.Â  The Brazells had\r\n  executed a HUD-1 Settlement Statement and deed conveying the property to Windsor in advance of the closing date.Â  The total purchase price was $550,000, and after\r\n  satisfying liens the Brazells were to receive $327,818.54 in net proceeds.Â \r\n \r\nOn December 3, 2004, Windsor or her agent notified the Brazells\r\n  the reverse osmosis system on the property did not function.[2]Â  On December 6, 2004, the deed was\r\n  recorded and Windsorâ€™s closing attorney forwarded the Brazells a check for the\r\n  net proceeds.Â  Windsor withheld $2,000 from the check, noting in the memo\r\n  section of the check that the amount reflects â€œsellerâ€™s proceeds less $2,000\r\n  escrow for reverse osmosis system repair.â€Â  Along with the net proceeds check, Windsorâ€™s attorney also forwarded an escrow agreement proposing how the parties would\r\n  treat the $2,000.Â  The Brazells refused to accept the check, refused to execute\r\n  the escrow agreement, and demanded the transaction cease.\r\nThe Brazells\r\n  filed this action alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and requesting\r\n  rescission of the contract.Â  Windsor moved to dismiss the remedy of\r\n  rescission.Â  The circuit court granted her motion, and the Brazells appeal.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts\r\n  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C.\r\n  106, 116, 628 S.E.2d 869, 874&nbsp;(2006).Â  The decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss must be based solely upon\r\n  the allegations set forth in the complaint. Â Id.; Clearwater Trust v. Bunting, 367 S.C. 340, 343, 626 S.E.2d 334, 335&nbsp;(2006).Â  In\r\n  deciding whether the circuit court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the\r\n  appellate court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.Â  Spence, at\r\n  116, 628 S.E.2d at 874&nbsp;(2006).Â  A motion to dismiss under Rule\r\n  12(b)(6) should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably\r\n  deducible therefrom entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory.Â  Id.; Overcash v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 364 S.C. 569, 572, 614 S.E.2d 619,\r\n  620&nbsp;(2005).Â  Furthermore, the complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court\r\n  doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  Spence, at 116-17, 628\r\n  S.E.2d at 874.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Assumption of\r\n  Truth in the Pleadings\r\nThe Brazells argue\r\n  the circuit court failed to consider the allegations in the complaint as\r\n  truthful and therefore erred in granting Windsorâ€™s motion to dismiss the remedy\r\n  of rescission at the 12(b)(6) stage.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nRescission\r\n  is an equitable remedy that attempts to undo a contract from the beginning as\r\n  if the contract had never existed.Â  Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C.\r\n  78, 95, 594 S.E.2d 485, 494 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations omitted). Â â€œIt is a\r\n  general legal principle that a breach of contract warranting rescission â€˜must\r\n  be so substantial and fundamental as to defeat the purpose of the contract.â€™â€Â  Rogers\r\n    v. Salisbury Brick Corp., 299 S.C. 141, 143, 382 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1989) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  See also Gibbs v. G.K.H., Inc., 311 S.C. 103, 105, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Furthermore, rescission should only be\r\n  granted when breaches defeat the object of the contracting parties and not for\r\n  minor or casual breaches.Â  Rogers, at 143-44, 382 S.E.2d at 917 (citing Davis&nbsp;v.\r\n    Cordell, 237 S.C. 88, 115 S.E.2d 649 (1960) (applying this doctrine to real\r\n  estate transactions)); Ellie, at 95, 594 S.E.2d at 494. Â As a remedy,\r\n  rescission should return the contracting parties to the status quo ante.Â  See Ellie, at 95, 594 S.E.2d at 494.Â  Finally,\r\n  courts should not grant rescission where the nonmoving party has substantially\r\n  changed position in reliance on a contract.Â  See King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 313-314, 318 S.E.2d 125, 129 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\n \r\nHere, taking the\r\n  facts as alleged in the complaint as true, the Brazells failed to state facts\r\n  sufficient to justify resorting to the remedy of rescission. [3]Â \r\n  Their alleged minor breach of $2,000 held in escrow pending repairs is not\r\n  substantial or fundamental enough to defeat the purpose of a $550,000 real\r\n  estate transaction.[4]Â \r\n  Windsor withheld the $2,000 in lieu of requiring that the Brazells repair the\r\n  reverse osmosis system.Â  The $2,000 withheld amounted to .04% of the total\r\n  contract cost.Â  Furthermore, Windsor did not refuse to pay the $2,000, it was\r\n  simply held in escrow.Â  Due to the minor alleged breach, South Carolina law\r\n  will not afford rescission as a remedy in this case.Â   \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the circuit court bottomed its opinion on the difficulty that would be involved\r\n  in returning the parties to the status quo ante.Â  While this argument\r\n  has substantial appeal, we need not address it as we have already determined\r\n  the claimed breach was not substantial enough in nature to warrant rescission.Â  \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Grounds not\r\n  Stated in Initial Motion[5]\r\nThe\r\n  Brazells further argue dismissal of the rescission remedy is improper because\r\n  the order grants relief on grounds not stated in Windsorâ€™s 12(b)(6) motion.Â  Windsorâ€™s initial motion to dismiss was premised upon the grounds that rescission is an\r\n  equitable remedy that could not be sought in an action at law.Â  Windsor then faxed a memorandum in support of motion to the Brazells on the day before the\r\n  hearing raising the issues of material breach and return of the parties to the status\r\n    quo ante.\r\nThe\r\n  Brazells describe Windsorâ€™s actions as an â€œamendment by ambush.â€Â  However, the\r\n  Brazells failed to move for a continuance on the day of the hearing to avoid\r\n  any perceived â€œambush.â€Â  Consequently, the court was denied the opportunity to\r\n  rule on this issue, and it is not preserved for our review.Â  See A\r\n    &amp; I, Inc. v. Gore, 366 S.C. 233, 243, 621 S.E.2d 383, 388 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (finding issue of last-minute presentation of magistrateâ€™s return not preserved\r\n  where appellant failed to request a continuance and circuit court was therefore\r\n  denied opportunity to rule); Mixson, Inc. v. Am. Loyalty Ins. Co., 349\r\n  S.C. 394, 401, 562 S.E.2d 659, 663 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding grant of summary\r\n  judgment on same day as granting motion to compel not preserved for review\r\n  where appellant failed to move for a continuance for discovery to be completed). \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; 12(b)(6) Motion Converted\r\n  into Summary Judgment\r\nFinally, the Brazells contend the 12(b)(6) motion was\r\n  converted into a motion for summary judgment because the circuit court weighed\r\n  the facts and considered the issue of material breach.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nInitially, we note\r\n  the circuit court must consider the issue of material breach in order to\r\n  determine whether to grant or deny Brazellâ€™s 12(b)(6) motion.Â  This consideration\r\n  alone does not convert Brazellâ€™s motion into a summary judgment motion.Â  Rather,\r\n  a 12(b)(6) motion is converted into a motion for summary judgment when the court\r\n  goes outside the face of the complaint to rule on the motion.Â  Here, there was\r\n  no need for the circuit court to consider evidence outside the complaint and\r\n  its attachments to determine no material breach was alleged.Â  Furthermore, even\r\n  if the circuit court looked outside the face of the complaint, the error would\r\n  be harmless.Â  See Higgins&nbsp;v. MUSC, 326 S.C. 592, 605, 486\r\n  S.E.2d 269, 275 (Ct. App. 1997) (indicating conversion of a 12(b)(6) motion\r\n  into a summary judgment motion may be harmless error when, without reference to\r\n  the matters outside of the plaintiffâ€™s complaint, dismissal can still be\r\n  justified under Rule 12(b)(6)).Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.Â   \r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Windsor filed a motion to dismiss with this court\r\n  arguing the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.Â Â  After\r\n  hearing argument from both parties, we deny the motion.\r\n[2]&nbsp; A reverse osmosis system is used to improve\r\n  the smell and taste of water in places where tap water is of poor quality.Â \r\n \r\n[3]&nbsp; Nakell v. Liner Yankelevitz Sunshine &amp;\r\n  Regenstreif, LLP, 394 F.Supp.2d 762 (M.D.N.C. 2005), has a different result\r\n  but applies the same analysis employed in this case.Â  â€œ[T]o justify rescission\r\n  of a contract, the breach of the contract must be so material as in effect to\r\n  defeat the very terms of the contract.â€Â  Id. at 769.Â  In Nakell,\r\n  the court held the counterclaim for rescission should not have been dismissed\r\n  because the court could not determine whether there was a material breach or\r\n  whether the parties could be returned to their original position from the\r\n    pleadings alone. Â Id. at 771.  \r\n[4]&nbsp; Although the complaint does not contain the\r\n  overall purchase price of the property, the HUD-1 reveals that information.\r\n[5]&nbsp; The analysis of issues involved in the first\r\n  and second arguments on appeal are similar and are therefore combined herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4310","title":"State v.

Â We affirm in part\r\n  and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nFrazier was tried for\r\n  the murder and armed robbery of William Brent Poole, the husband of Frazierâ€™s\r\n  paramour, Renee Poole.[1] Â Brent was murdered while he and Renee walked along the shore at Myrtle Beach on the night of June 9, 1998.[2]Â \r\n  Officer Scott Brown of the Myrtle Beach Police Department testified that while\r\n  on beach patrol in his truck the night of the murder he was approached by Renee.Â \r\n  Brown testified that Renee told him, â€œmy husband has been shot.â€ Â After briefly\r\n  examining the scene and realizing Brent had in fact been shot, Brown escorted\r\n  Renee back to his truck and radioed dispatch.Â  As he did so, Renee â€œkept\r\n  touching her chest and saying â€˜we were robbed.â€™â€Â  As he was talking to\r\n  dispatch, Brown asked Renee to describe the killer. Â She told him the suspect\r\n  was wearing all black clothes and a ski mask and had instructed them to lie\r\n  face down on the beach\r\nThe trial judge had\r\n  initially agreed to allow the testimony regarding Reneeâ€™s statements at the\r\n  scene over Frazierâ€™s objection that the statements were testimonial in nature,\r\n  and Renee was not available for cross-examination.Â  However, upon\r\n  reconsideration the trial judge determined the testimony regarding all of\r\n  Reneeâ€™s statements except â€œmy husband has been shotâ€ should be stricken from\r\n  the record.Â  The trial judge then offered a curative instruction to the jury, and\r\n  the trial proceeded.  \r\nThe State called Donna\r\n  and Mark Hobbes who testified that as they exited the Carolina Winds Motel to\r\n  go for a walk on the beach the night of the murder, they noticed a man they\r\n  later described as being â€œsuspicious.â€Â  Mark testified that the man stared at\r\n  them, and he stared back until the man turned and moved quickly in the\r\n  direction of the beach.Â  Donna testified that she noticed the man because he\r\n  was running and because he had on dark, heavy clothing that seemed\r\n  inappropriate for the weather.Â  As the Hobbeses walked toward the beach access\r\n  point, which consisted of a short boardwalk and steps down to the strand, Donna\r\n  saw the man again crouched behind the motel. Â The man then stood and looked straight\r\n  at the couple so that both the Hobbeses were able to see his face. Â They testified\r\n  the man then ran in the general direction of the beach but toward an area where\r\n  there was heavy vegetation rather than the clear, sandy portion of the beach. Â The\r\n  couple later, both in independent photographic lineups and in court, identified\r\n  Frazier as the â€œsuspiciousâ€ man.Â  Both indicated they were confident in their\r\n  identification.\r\nFrazierâ€™s supervisor\r\n  testified that the week prior to the murder, Frazier had requested June 8, 9,\r\n  and 10 off from work.Â  Frazier offered no alibi for the night of the murder other\r\n  than telling officers he was home alone sick.Â  Captain William Frontz testified\r\n  that pursuant to a search warrant copies of a day planner were discovered at\r\n  Frazierâ€™s home. Â The day planner contained a notation on June 9: Â â€œRenee and Brent.â€Â \r\n  Other writing was above that notation but had been marked out.Â  Bruce Wolford,\r\n  a friend of Frazier, testified that Frazier hated Brent and the control he\r\n  exercised over Renee by virtue of their sharing a young daughter. Â Wolford also\r\n  testified that Renee and Frazier were together at Wolfordâ€™s home during the\r\n  time period before the murder when Renee and Frazier were allegedly no longer\r\n  romantically involved.Â  Wolford overheard the pair discussing the fact that\r\n  Renee and Brent were planning a trip to the beach.Â  Renee and Brentâ€™s neighbor,\r\n  James Bollow, testified that a black Chevrolet Blazer, the vehicle he had seen\r\n  Frazier in previously, had been at the Poole home during Brentâ€™s work hours and\r\n  during the days leading up to the murder.\r\nIt was further shown\r\n  that Frazier had previously owned a gun that could not be excluded as the\r\n  murder weapon.[3]Â \r\n  Frazier could not account for the whereabouts of the gun, indicating he had\r\n  sold it at a gun show.Â  The State also showed that Frazier had borrowed a\r\n  vehicle from a friend the day before the murder and returned it the day after\r\n  the murder.Â  Frazier told that same friend upon returning the vehicle that\r\n  Brent had been â€œshot and killedâ€ even though Frazierâ€™s contact with police to\r\n  that point had not involved any discussion of Brent having been shot.\r\nFinally, the State\r\n  presented the testimony of Howard Sirles who testified that he discovered\r\n  Brentâ€™s soaking wet wallet on July 5 in his yard located across the road from\r\n  the beach area that contained the murder scene.[4] Â Officer David Blubaugh testified the wallet contained Brentâ€™s driverâ€™s\r\n  license, $9 cash, two ATM cards, photographs, and other miscellaneous items.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Testimony of\r\n  Officer Brown\r\nFrazier contends\r\n  the trial judge erred in admitting, through the testimony of Officer Brown,\r\n  Reneeâ€™s statement â€œmy husband has been shot.â€Â  We disagree.Â  Before delving\r\n  into a lengthy Crawford[5] analysis, it becomes apparent that the propriety of the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on\r\n  this issue is not preserved for our review. Â The trial judge initially allowed\r\n  testimony regarding Reneeâ€™s statements to Officer Brown immediately after the\r\n  murder finding them to be non-testimonial.Â  After reconsidering the issue, the\r\n  trial judge informed the jury that all statements other than â€œmy husband has\r\n  been shotâ€ would be stricken from the record and could not be considered as\r\n  evidence.Â  The attorneys and the trial judge agreed this was an acceptable way\r\n  for this matter to be dealt with, and Frazier offered no objection even after\r\n  the judge read the verbatim curative instruction she planned to give the jury.Â \r\n  In order to preserve such an issue for our review where a curative instruction\r\n  was offered, an appellant must make a contemporaneous objection to the\r\n  sufficiency of the instruction or make a motion for mistrial.Â  State v.\r\n    Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 658-59, 623 S.E.2d 122, 130 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In this\r\n  instance, the curative instruction specifically allowed for the inclusion of\r\n  the statement â€œmy husband has been shot.â€Â  Not having objected to that portion\r\n  of the curative instruction, nor having moved for a mistrial, Frazier cannot\r\n  now claim error in the admission of the statement. Â \r\nII.Â  Denial of\r\n  Directed Verdict Motionâ€”Murder\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed verdict, this court must\r\n  view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\r\n  the state.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence\r\n  reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must\r\n  find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  â€œWhen the state relies exclusively on\r\n  circumstantial evidence and a motion for directed verdict is made, the circuit\r\n  court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its\r\n  weight.â€Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478\r\n  (2004).Â  The court should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence presented\r\n  merely raises a suspicion of guilt.Â  Id.Â  â€œâ€˜Suspicionâ€™ implies a belief\r\n  or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to\r\n  proof.Â  However, a trial judge is not required to find that the\r\n    evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn this instance, the\r\n  State built its murder case out of numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence\r\n  coupled with the identification of the Hobbeses.Â  Testimony regarding Frazierâ€™s\r\n  ongoing, adulterous relationship with Renee and hatred of Brent provided\r\n  evidence of motive.Â  The prosecution presented evidence that the relationship\r\n  continued up until the time of Brentâ€™s murder, even though Renee and Frazier\r\n  were supposedly no longer a couple.Â  \r\n\r\nTestimony about Frazier\r\n  asking for time off from work and his lack of a corroborated alibi on the night\r\n  in question was evidence of opportunity.Â  In addition, there was testimony that\r\n  Renee and Frazier discussed the beach trip and that the date of the trip was indicated\r\n  on Frazierâ€™s calendar with the notation, â€œRenee and Brent.â€Â  Furthermore, a\r\n  friend of Frazierâ€™s testified that Frazier borrowed a car for the three-day\r\n  period around the time of the murder.Â  Upon returning the car to his friend,\r\n  Frazier stated that Brent had been shot.Â  The source of his knowledge of that\r\n  information is not revealed in the record, but the record shows he had not been\r\n  informed by police that Brent had been shot. Â Â \r\n\r\nThe State offered\r\n  evidence that Frazier had the means to commit the murder in that he owned a gun\r\n  that could have been the murder weapon.Â  Finally, there is the Hobbesesâ€™ unwavering\r\n  testimony placing Frazier at Renee and Brentâ€™s hotel and close to the murder scene\r\n  at the relevant time.Â  This is in contrast to Frazierâ€™s claim to police that he\r\n  had not been to Myrtle Beach in four years.Â  Taken together, these things amount\r\n  to more than a mere suspicion Frazier committed the crime.Â  It was within the\r\n  juryâ€™s province to determine if the evidence established proof of guilt beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt, and they concluded that it did.Â  We conclude the trial judge\r\n  did not err in denying Frazierâ€™s motion for directed verdict.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Denial of\r\n  Directed Verdict Motionâ€”Armed Robbery\r\nâ€œRobbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking\r\n  of money, goods, or other personal property of any value from the person of\r\n  another in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Parker, 351 S.C. 567, 570, 571 S.E.2d 288, 289Â  (2002) (overruled on\r\n  other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005)).Â  Armed\r\n  robbery occurs when a person commits a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon,\r\n  while using a representation of a deadly weapon, or while using an object the\r\n  victim reasonably believed was a deadly weapon.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A)\r\n  (Rev. 2003).  \r\nWe have reviewed the record for evidence to support the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s denial of Frazierâ€™s directed verdict motion on the armed robbery\r\n  charge.Â  While there admittedly is evidence that could support a robbery\r\n  charge, we do not believe the evidence rises above the level of creating a mere\r\n  suspicion that Frazier committed an armed robbery.Â  Pooleâ€™s wallet was\r\n  discovered in Mr. Sirlesâ€™ yard almost a month after the murder, with no\r\n  fingerprints or any evidence to connect it to Frazier. Â The contents of the\r\n  wallet appeared to be intact.Â  A wedding ring was found in the sand near\r\n  Brentâ€™s body, but there is no testimony in the record to identify that ring as\r\n  belonging to the deceased.[6]\r\nHad\r\n  Reneeâ€™s statements to Officer Brown indicating a robbery had been committed been\r\n  allowed, we would be presented with an altogether different analysis.Â  However,\r\n  absent those statements, or any substantial circumstantial evidence connecting\r\n  Frazier to an armed robbery of Brent Poole, we are left to merely speculate how\r\n  the wallet found its way to Mr. Sirlesâ€™ yard.Â  The meager facts and\r\n  circumstances the jury was left to rely upon do no more than create a mere\r\n  suspicion of guilt.Â  A directed verdict motion should be granted when the\r\n  evidence presented merely raises a suspicion of guilt.Â  Therefore, the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of Frazierâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of\r\n  armed robbery was error.\r\nFor all of the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This is Frazierâ€™s second trial on these charges.Â  The South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court reversed and remanded Frazierâ€™s original conviction because\r\n  certain expert evidence was not admitted and certain unreliable, hearsay\r\n  statements by a co-worker were admitted.Â  State v. Frazier, 357 S.C.\r\n  161, 592 S.E.2d 621 (2004).\r\n[2] The parties were all residents of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Â  Brent\r\n  and Renee had come to Myrtle Beach to celebrate their wedding anniversary.\r\n[3] The murder weapon was never discovered, but through ballistics analysis\r\n  of the fired bullets the Stateâ€™s forensic expert could determine that the\r\n  murder weapon was likely one of a list of 38 guns.\r\n[4] Sirlesâ€™ prior deposition testimony was read into the record because he\r\n  was unable to attend the trial due to health problems.Â   \r\n[5] Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).\r\n[6] In the\r\n  Stateâ€™s closing argument the solicitor characterizes the wedding ring as\r\n  belonging to Brent, and there is no objection from Frazier.Â  We cannot, however,\r\n  ascertain in the record any direct testimony identifying the ring as belonging\r\n  to Brent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4311","title":"Green Tree Servicing v.

Â On January 18, 2005, a hearing was held before the master-in-equity.Â  Green Tree waived its right to a deficiency judgment.Â  Green Tree purchased the property at public auction for $58,583.Â  The amount of Green Treeâ€™s debt was $80,904.44.Â  The master entered a report and confirmation of the sale on February 28, 2005.Â  \r\n \r\nGreen Tree discovered Adamsâ€™ judgment lien in June of 2005 and filed a â€œRule to Show Cause and Petition ancillary proceedingâ€ to add Adams as a party to the foreclosure action. Â On December 19, 2005, the master entered an order stating he no longer had subject matter jurisdiction to add Adams as a party to the case.\r\nGreen Tree then filed this action to clear title in circuit court. Â The court denied Adamsâ€™ motion to dismiss and Adams counterclaimed seeking to foreclose his judgment lien. Â Adams stipulated he would have been unable and unwilling to bid at the foreclosure sale and further stipulated the value of the property was less than Green Treeâ€™s debt.Â  The circuit court bound Adams to the previous foreclosure proceedings and cleared Green Treeâ€™s property from Adamsâ€™ judgment lien. Â Adams appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to remove a cloud on and quiet title to land is one in equity.â€Â  Bryan v. Freeman, 253 S.C. 50, 52, 168 S.E.2d 793, 793 (1969). In an action in equity, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834 (2005).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Binding a Non-Party to a Foreclosure Action Thereby Extinguishing a Lien\r\nAdams first argues the circuit court cannot bind him to a foreclosure action to which he was not a party, thereby extinguishing his lien.Â  We agree in part but find no reversible error.Â \r\n \r\nA court may not act against a party without personal jurisdiction.Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2006).Â  Moreover, a court should not render a judgment affecting the rights of a party without proper notice.Â  Ex Parte South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 350 S.C. 404, 407, 566 S.E.2d 196, 198 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court cannot bind Adams to the prior judgment.Â  Â Â \r\nHowever, the circuit court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Adams in the subsequent action to clear title. Â Green Tree served Adams in this action and Adams fully participated by defending and counterclaiming for relief.Â  \r\n \r\nLikewise, the circuit court properly concluded Adams has no recourse against Green Tree or the property.Â  First, Adams declined to exercise any possible right of redemption by stipulating that the value of the property was less than the amount owed to Green Tree and that he had neither the ability nor the willingness to buy the property. Â See 27 S.C. Jurisprudence Â§ 109, at 247-48 (1996) (â€œAn omitted junior lienholder retains his right of redemption, giving him the right to tender to the buyer at the senior foreclosure sale the balance which was owed on the senior lien at the time of the foreclosure.â€).Â  Id. at 248 (â€œRedemption requires payment of the entire debt that has accrued upon the senior mortgage. . . regardless of whether the property brought less at the foreclosure sale.â€). Therefore, Green Treeâ€™s failure to serve Adams or make him a party to the foreclosure action did not prejudice Adams.Â  Although Adams cannot enforce his lien against this property, his judgment is not extinguished but is still of record. Â Adams simply must seek relief on his judgment from another source.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nII.Â  Union National Bank v. Cook\r\nAdams next argues the circuit court erred in relying on Union National Bank of Columbia v. Cook, 110 S.C. 99, 96 S.E. 484 (1918).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court quoted the following language from Union National Bank:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tBut it should appear to the Court that the junior incumbrancer has a substantial right in the land to be protected and his lien enforced for some practical purpose, and not merely the prosecution of a fictitious cause of action. In other words, it must appear to the court prima facie that the land is worth more than prior incumbrances and that in probability upon a resale of the land the proceeds would reach the claim of the junior incumbrancer.\r\n\r\nId. at 115, 96 S.E. at 488.Â  The circuit court cited this language to emphasize that the debt Claxton owed to Green Tree substantially exceeded the foreclosed propertyâ€™s value such that any resale of the property would not benefit Adams as a junior lien holder.Â  Like the lienholder in Union National Bank, Adams is unable to show how his absence from the foreclosure action prejudiced him. \r\n \r\nIII.Â  Statutory Language\r\nAdams finally argues his lien can only be extinguished, pursuant to section 15-39-880 of the South Carolina Code, by naming him as a party in the foreclosure action.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tSection 15-39-880 provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNo lien created by operation of law . . . shall constitute a lien or attach or reattach as a lien on real property of the lien debtor or real property in which the lien debtor has an interest after a public sale of such real property at any execution or judicial sale in any action or special proceeding to which the lien creditor is duly made a party as provided by law. But this section and Â§ 15-39-890 shall not be construed to affect any prior mortgage lien not foreclosed in any such action or special proceeding and shall not be construed to require the foreclosure of any such prior mortgage lien . . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-880 (2005).Â  Adams again maintains his lien was improperly extinguished in the foreclosure action.Â  As explained above, the foreclosure action did not improperly extinguish Adamsâ€™ lien.Â  Rather, this proceeding removed the lien and cleared title to that property.Â  Adamsâ€™ judgment remains viable and on the judgment roll.\r\nFinally, our supreme court addressed the necessity of making a junior lien holder a party under similar facts in Peeples v. Snyder, stating:Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe first mortgagee had the legal right to foreclose his mortgage without making the second mortgagee a party to the action. While the second mortgagee, under the circumstances, was a \r\n\t\tproper party, she was not a necessary party; and however expedient it may have been, and was, to have made her a party, as this case has demonstrated, in order that all questions might be determined in the one action, the omission did not affect the validity of the foreclosure proceedings; it only affected the \r\n\t\teffectiveness of it in leaving open, undetermined, the rights of the second mortgagee.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n141 S.C. 152, 156, 139 S.E. 405, 406 (1927) (emphasis in original).Â  As in Peeples, the omission of Adams in the foreclosure proceedings did not invalidate the sale.Â  Rather, it merely left Adamsâ€™ rights as to the Green Tree property undetermined, which have now been addressed in this case.Â  As previously noted, his judgment against Claxton remains viable. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is  \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Adamsâ€™ mortgage was recorded again on December 7, 2004.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4312","title":"State v.

Elliott, and\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Julie Thames, all of Columbia; and Scarlett Anne\r\n  Wilson of Charleston, Â for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Vernon Tumbleston appeals his convictions for first- degree criminal sexual\r\n  conduct with a minor and committing a lewd act on a minor, arguing the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictments.Â \r\n  Specifically, Tumbleston maintains the indictments did\r\n  not allege the specific time of each offense intended to be charged, and thus, failed\r\n  to provide him with adequate notice to prepare a defense.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe present\r\n  case revolves around the accusations of Tumblestonâ€™s granddaughter, B.J., who\r\n  was ten years old at the time of Tumblestonâ€™s trial.Â  In late 2004, B.J. told\r\n  her mother Tumbleston had repeatedly molested her over the course of several\r\n  years.Â  The violation began when she was in kindergarten and continued\r\n  throughout the second grade.Â  B.J. alleged Tumbleston â€œlicked [her] private,â€\r\n  â€œstuck his private in [her] private,â€ â€œstuck his private in [her] mouth,â€ and\r\n  â€œputÂ  [her] hand on his private.â€Â  B.J. claimed these acts occurred more than\r\n  once over the three-year period.Â  B.J. did not tell her mother about the\r\n  abuse until approximately three years after it began, when she refused to go\r\n  shopping with Tumbleston.Â  After hearing B.J.â€™s account of the sexual abuse, B.J.â€™s\r\n  mother took her to a local pediatrician and the Lowcountry Childrenâ€™s Center\r\n  for examination.Â  Subsequently, a representative from â€œPeople Against Rapeâ€\r\n  notified the North Charleston Police Department of B.J.â€™s accusations.Â  During the\r\n  police investigation, Tumbleston agreed to give an oral statement regarding his\r\n  alleged molestation of B.J.Â  According to Tumbleston, â€œthere [was] a\r\n  possibility that he might have touched [B.J.] between her legs while he was\r\n  asleep.â€Â  Additionally, â€œit [was] possible [Tumblestonâ€™s] penis came out of his\r\n  pants and touched [B.J.].â€Â   \r\nTumbleston\r\n  was indicted on four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a\r\n  minor and one count of committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  The indictments\r\n  alleged the charged offenses occurred between 2001 and 2004.Â  Tumbleston moved\r\n  to quash the indictments on the ground of insufficiency, asserting the indictments failed to indicate the specific time of each offense,\r\n  thus depriving him of adequate notice.Â  Despite Tumblestonâ€™s contention, the trial court found\r\n  the indictments sufficient as long as the State â€œtie[d] in the dates of the\r\n  time frame with some type of rational testimony from other people.â€Â   \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Tumbleston guilty on two counts of first-degree criminal sexual\r\n  conduct with a minor and one count of committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  The court directed a verdict of not guilty on one count\r\n  of criminal sexual conduct, and the jury acquitted Tumbleston on another count\r\n  of criminal sexual conduct.Â  The\r\n  trial court sentenced Tumbleston to concurrent terms of imprisonment totaling\r\n  twenty-two years followed by five years probation.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  trial courtâ€™s factual conclusions as to the sufficiency of an indictment will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse\r\n  of discretion.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220\r\n  (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.Â  Id.; see also State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 506, 626 S.E.2d 59, 63 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. granted June 7,\r\n  2007; State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 472, 613 S.E.2d 381, 384\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Accordingly, an appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings when the findings are supported by the evidence and not controlled\r\n  by error of law.Â  Baccus, 367 S.C. at 48, 625 S.E.2d at 220; Douglas, 367 S.C. at 506, 626 S.E.2d at 63. \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Insufficient Indictment\r\nTumbleston\r\n  avers the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictments on\r\n  the ground of insufficiency. Â Tumbleston contends the indictments did not\r\n  allege the specific time of each offense intended to be charged, and therefore,\r\n  failed to provide him with adequate notice to prepare a defense.Â  We\r\n  disagree.  \r\nA.\r\n  The Indictment: A â€œNotice Documentâ€\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 101-02, 610 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2005), our\r\n  supreme court â€œabandoned the view that, in criminal matters, the circuit court\r\n  acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear a particular case by way of a\r\n  valid [grand jury] indictment.â€Â  State v. Means, 367 S.C. 374, 381, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 348, 352 (2006). Â Prior to Gentry, the circuit court did not have\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction in a criminal case unless: (1) there was an\r\n  indictment sufficiently stating an offense; (2) the defendant waived\r\n  presentment of the indictment to the grand jury; or (3) the charge was a lesser-included\r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  Means, 367 S.C. at 381,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 352; Evans v. State, 363 S.C. 495, 507-09, 611 S.E.2d 510,\r\n  516-18 (2005); Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362-63, 495 S.E.2d 773,\r\n  777 (1998); Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359\r\n  (1995); State\r\n    v. Beachum, 288 S.C. 325, 326, 342 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1986); Summerall v.\r\n      State, 278 S.C. 255, 256, 294 S.E.2d 344, 344 (1982); State v. Tabory,\r\n  262 S.C. 136, 139-40, 202 S.E.2d 852, 853 (1974).Â Â  Consequently, a defective\r\n  or insufficient indictment often resulted in the lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction, â€œwhich is a matter that may be raised at any time, including on\r\n  direct appeal, in a [post-conviction relief] action or sua sponte by the trial or appellate courts.â€Â  Means,\r\n    367 S.C. at 381, 626 S.E.2d at 352; see also State v. Munn, 292\r\n    S.C. 497, 499, 357 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1987) (concluding trial court lacks subject\r\n    matter jurisdiction to convict defendant for an offense if there is no indictment\r\n    charging him with the offense when the jury is sworn).\r\nAs our supreme court recognized in Gentry, the subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction of the circuit court and the sufficiency of an indictment\r\n  are two distinct concepts.Â  Gentry, 363 S.C. at 102 n.6, 610 S.E.2d at\r\n  499 n.6 (â€œ[P]resentment of an indictment or a waiver of presentment is not\r\n  needed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court.â€).Â  â€œSubject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the\r\n  general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. at 100, 610 S.E.2d at 498; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 150, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 222, 227 (2000); Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235,\r\n  237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994); see also S.C. Const. art. V,\r\n  Â§ 11 (providing circuit court â€œshall be a general trial court with original\r\n  jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate\r\n  jurisdiction as provided by lawâ€).  \r\nâ€œHowever, an indictment is needed to give notice to the\r\n  defendant of the charges against him.â€Â  Gentry, 363 S.C. at 102 n.6, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 499 n.6. (Emphasis added).Â  Definitively, an indictment is a â€œnotice document.â€ Â See S.C. Const. art.\r\n  I, Â§ 11 (â€œNo person may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over\r\n  which is not within the magistrateâ€™s court, unless on a presentment or\r\n  indictment of a grand jury of the county where the crime has been committed. .\r\n  . .â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003) (â€œNo person shall be held to answer in\r\n  any court for an alleged crime or offense, unless upon indictment by a grand\r\n  jury. . . .â€).Â  Indeed,  \r\n\r\n\t[t]he indictment is the\r\n  charge of the state against the defendant, the pleading by which he is informed\r\n  of the fact, and the nature and scope of the accusation.Â  When that indictment\r\n  is presented, that accusation made, that pleading filed, the accused has two\r\n  courses of procedure open to him. Â He may question the propriety of the\r\n  accusation, the manner in which it has been presented, the source from which it\r\n  proceeds, and have these matters promptly and properly determined; or, waiving\r\n  them, he may put in issue the truth of the accusation, and demand the judgment\r\n  of his peers on the merits of the charge. Â If he omits the former, and chooses\r\n  the latter, he ought not, when defeated on the latter,-when found guilty of the\r\n  crime charged,-to be permitted to go back to the former, and inquire as to the\r\n  manner and means by which the\r\n  charge was presented.\r\n\r\nGentry, 363 S.C. at 102, 610 S.E.2d at 499-500 (quoting State v.\r\n  Faile, 43 S.C. 52, 59-60, 20 S.E. 798, 801 (1895), overruled on other\r\n    grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315\r\n      (1991)). \r\nPursuant to Gentry, an indictment reputed to be insufficient\r\n  no longer raises a question of subject matter jurisdiction; rather, it raises a question of whether\r\n  a defendant properly received notice he would be tried for a particular crime.Â  See Evans, 363 S.C. at 507-09, 611 S.E.2d at 516-17; see also State v. Smalls, 364 S.C. 343, 346-48, 613 S.E.2d 754, 756-57 (2005)\r\n  (holding circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea\r\n  where defendant was not indicted for the charge to which he pled guilty, but\r\n  signed a sentencing sheet which established defendant was notified of the\r\n  charge to which he pled guilty).Â  \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Sufficiency of the Indictment\r\nA\r\n  challenge to the sufficiency of an indictment must be made before the jury is\r\n  sworn.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003).Â  If the objection is timely made, the\r\n  circuit court should evaluate the sufficiency of the indictment by determining\r\n  whether (1) the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity\r\n  to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to\r\n  know what he is called upon to answer and whether\r\n  he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it apprises\r\n  the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged.Â  Gentry,\r\n  363 S.C. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500 (citing State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C.\r\n  462, 465, 578 S.E.2d 717, 719 (2003)).Â  A ruling on a timely objection, before\r\n  the jury is sworn, that an indictment is not sufficient will result in the\r\n  quashing of the indictment unless the defendant waives presentment to the grand\r\n  jury and pleads guilty. Â Cutner v. State, 354 S.C. 151, 155, 580 S.E.2d\r\n  120, 122-23 (2003), overruled on other grounds by Gentry,\r\n  363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494; Hopkins v.

Means,\r\n  367 S.C. 374, 383, 626 S.E.2d 348, 353-54 (2006); Gentry, 363 S.C. at\r\n  103, 610 S.E.2d at 500; State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75,\r\n  78 (1993); State v.

Â Gentry, 363 S.C. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500.Â  As repeatedly noted by our appellate courts:\r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with [enough] certainty and\r\n  particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the\r\n  defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an\r\n  acquittal or conviction thereon. Â The true test of the sufficiency of an\r\n  indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and\r\n  certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended\r\n  to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be\r\n  prepared to meet.Â  \r\n\r\nSee Means, 367 S.C. at 383, 626 S.E.2d at 353-54; Gentry, 363 S.C. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500; State\r\n  v.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20\r\n  (2003); see also State\r\n    v. Pierce, 263 S. C. 23, 27, 207 S.\r\n  E. 2d 414, 416 (1974); State\r\n    v. Quarles, 261 S. C. 413, 417, 200 S.

Nicholson, 366 S.C. 568, 574, 623 S.E.2d 100, 103 (Ct.

Wingo, 304 S.C. 173, 175, 403 S.E.2d 322, 323 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding an indictment charging first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor covering a two-year period was sufficient as to\r\n  time); see also State v.

App. 1991) (â€œThe\r\n  specific date and time is not an element of the offense of first-degree\r\n  criminal sexual conduct.â€).\r\nContrary\r\n  to Tumblestonâ€™s contention, the indictments need not specify the precise time of\r\n  each offense charged because (1) time is not a material element of each offense;\r\n  and (2) the three-year\r\n  time period covered by the indictments occurred prior to the return of the\r\n  indictments by the grand jury.Â  Nicholson, 366\r\n  S.C. at 574, 623 S.E.2d at 103; see also State v.

Jur. 2d Rape Â§ 34, at 582 (2001) (â€œBecause time is not an essential\r\n  ingredient of either forcible or statutory rape, the exact date of the\r\n  commission of the offense need not be alleged unless a statute provides\r\n  otherwise.â€); 75 C.J.S.

Â Section 16-3-655 of the South Carolina Code of Laws sets forth the\r\n  statutory provision for first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor as\r\n  follows:  \r\n\r\n\t(A)&nbsp; A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor\r\n  in the first degree if:\r\n\t(1)&nbsp; the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is\r\n  less than eleven years of age; or\r\n\t(2)&nbsp; the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is\r\n  less than sixteen years of age and the actor has previously been convicted of,\r\n  pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or adjudicated delinquent for an offense\r\n  listed in Section 23-3-430(C) or has been ordered to be included in the sex\r\n  offender registry pursuant to Section 23-3-430(D).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (Supp.\r\n  2006).\r\n\r\n\tâ€œSexual\r\n  batteryâ€ means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or\r\n  any intrusion, however slight, of any part of a personâ€™s body or of any object\r\n  into the genital or anal openings of another personâ€™s body, except when such\r\n  intrusion is accomplished for medically recognized treatment or diagnostic\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h)\r\n  (2003).Â   \r\nThe crime of\r\n  committing or attempting to commit a lewd act on a child under sixteen is set\r\n  forth in section 16-15-140 as follows:Â   \r\n\r\n\tIt\r\n  is unlawful for a person over the age of fourteen years to wilfully and lewdly\r\n  commit or attempt a lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body, or its parts,\r\n  of a child under the age of sixteen years, with the intent of arousing,\r\n  appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of the\r\n  person or of the child.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

[1]\r\n\tIndictment\r\n  2005-GS-10-808: That [appellant] did in Charleston County on or between 2001 and June 2004\r\n  engage in sexual battery upon [B.J.], date of birth 1-23-96, to wit:\r\n  cunnilingus.Â  This is in violation of Â§ 16-3-655 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Laws (1976) as amended.\r\n\tIndictment\r\n  2005-GS-10-809: That [appellant] did in Charleston County on or between 2001 and June 2004\r\n  engage in sexual battery upon [B.J.], date of birth 1-23-96, to wit: digital\r\n  penetration.Â  This is in violation of Â§ 16-3-655 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Laws (1976) as amended. [2]\r\n\tIndictment\r\n  2005-GS-10-810:Â \r\n  That [appellant] did in Charleston County on or between 2001 and June 2004\r\n  engage in sexual battery upon [B.J.], date of birth 1-23-96, to wit: sexual\r\n  intercourse.Â  This is in violation of Â§ 16-3-655 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Laws (1976) as amended.\r\n\tIndictment\r\n  2005-GS-10-811: That [appellant] did in Charleston County on or between 2001 and June 2004\r\n  willfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd and lascivious act upon or with\r\n  the body of one [B.J.], a child under the age of sixteen years, with the intent\r\n  of arousing, appealing to, and gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual\r\n  desires of himself or such child.Â  This is in violation of Â§ 16-15-140 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code of Laws (1976) as amended.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  indictments clearly identify the elements of each offense charged,\r\n  substantially tracking the statutory language so plainly that the nature of the\r\n  offense charged can be easily understood.Â  Each indictment establishes an\r\n  offense of sexual battery as defined in section 16-3-651 or lewd act on a minor\r\n  as defined in section 16-15-140.Â  The victimâ€™s date of birth substantiates that\r\n  she was under the age of eleven when the offenses occurred. Â The conduct charged\r\n  occurred â€œon or between 2001 and June 2004.â€Â  Furthermore, the indictments indicate\r\n  the offenses occurred prior to the February 15, 2005 grand jury indictment.Â  \r\n \r\nTime is not a material element of either first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor or committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-655, 16-15-140 (2003 and Supp. 2006).Â  The State is not required to denote the precise day, or even year, of the accused conduct in an\r\n  indictment charging criminal sexual conduct. Â Thompson, 305 S.C. at 501,\r\n  409 S.E.2d at 423. Â Indeed, indictments for a sex crime that allege offenses\r\n  occurred during a specified time period are sufficient when the circumstances\r\n  of the case warrant considering an extended time frame.Â  Nicholson, 366\r\n  S.C. at 574, 623 S.E.2d at 103; see also State v.\r\n    Alexander, 140 S.C. 325, 138 S.E. 835, 839 (1927) (noting â€œsurplusage will\r\n  not vitiate an indictment which, without regard to the surplusage, is\r\n  sufficient to charge the offense for which the defendant is being indictedâ€).Â  \r\n \r\nThe stealth and repetitive nature of the alleged conduct compels\r\n  identification of the broader time period.Â  The victim is a young child, whom\r\n  one cannot reasonably expect to recall the exact dates of the sexual abuse.Â  B.J.\r\n  verified the abuse began while she was in kindergarten, and she ensured the end\r\n  of the abuse when she disclosed the offenses to her mother.Â Â Â   \r\nWe reject the notion that a specified time period prevented Tumbleston\r\n  from adequately preparing his defense to the charges. Â Reading the indictments\r\n  objectively from a reasonable personâ€™s view, we conclude they contain the\r\n  necessary elements of the offenses charged and sufficiently apprise Tumbleston\r\n  that he must be prepared to address his conduct toward B.J. between 2001 and\r\n  June 2004.\r\nTumbleston\r\n  proceeded with the defense of denial, and the jury simply rejected this defense.\r\n  His contention regarding the sufficiency of the indictments is without merit\r\n  and we discern no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp; Motion for\r\n  Directed Verdict\r\nTumbleston maintains the trial court erred in denying his motion\r\n  for a directed verdict.Â  However, Tumbleston failed to argue or identify supporting authority on this issue\r\n  in his brief on appeal.Â  Consequently, we deem this issue abandoned.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363 444 S.E.2d 513, 515 (1994)\r\n  (stating an issue is abandoned where the appellant fails to provide argument or\r\n  supporting authority); see also Fassett v. Evans, 364 S.C. 42,\r\n  45, 610 S.E.2d 841, 844 (Ct. App. 2005); Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 77, 557 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on a jurisprudential evaluation, we place our imprimatur and\r\n  approbation upon the challenged indictments in regard to factual and legal\r\n  sufficiency.Â  Because we hold that the specific date and time is not an element\r\n  of the offenses of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and lewd\r\n  act on a minor, the indictments in this case meet the test of â€œnotice\r\n  documents.â€Â   \r\nAccordingly, Tumblestonâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  The jury acquitted Tumbleston of Indictment 2005-GS-10-807. \r\n \r\n[2]Â Â  The court directed a verdict of not guilty on Indictment\r\n  2005-GS-10-809.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4313","title":"Peake v.

Peake (Peake) was arrested at the hospital for driving\r\n  under the influence.Â  He refused to consent to a blood alcohol test and, as a\r\n  result, the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (the Department)\r\n  suspended his driverâ€™s license.Â  The suspension was affirmed at an\r\n  administrative hearing and on appeal to the circuit court.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL /\r\n  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn February 5, 2005, Trooper J.T. Manley\r\n  of the South Carolina Highway Patrol responded to a one car accident on I-26 in\r\n  Charleston County.Â  He found Peake, the sole occupant of the wrecked car,\r\n  buckled into the driverâ€™s seat.Â  As Trooper Manley spoke with Peake, he\r\n  observed a strong smell of alcohol on Peakeâ€™s breath and noted his slurred\r\n  speech.Â  EMS arrived shortly after Trooper Manley and transported Peake to Trident Regional Medical Center.Â  At the hospital, Trooper Manley placed Peake under arrest\r\n  for driving under the influence.Â  Peake was read the Miranda rights and\r\n  the Advisement of Implied Consent Rights.Â  Trooper Manley then requested Peake\r\n  provide a blood sample believing Peakeâ€™s condition precluded a breath test.Â \r\n  Peake stated he understood his implied consent rights and refused to submit a\r\n  blood sample.Â  Trooper Manley then issued Peake a Notice of Suspension which\r\n  Peake refused to sign.\r\nAfter\r\n  receiving the Notice of Suspension, the Department suspended Peakeâ€™s license\r\n  for ninety days.Â  Peake requested an administrative hearing pursuant to South\r\n  Carolina Code section 56-5-2951(B)(2) (2006).Â  At the April 26, 2005, hearing, Trooper\r\n  Manley appeared and testified on behalf of the Department.Â  He said he\r\n  requested the blood sample because Peake was â€œnot able to give a breath sample\r\n  due to his condition.â€ Â The record contains no explanation of Peakeâ€™s\r\n  condition.Â  Peake did not appear though he was represented by counsel.Â  Peakeâ€™s\r\n  counsel did not cross-examine Trooper Manley but asserted the mandatory\r\n  suspension should be rescinded because the Department did not show medical\r\n  personnel deemed Peake unable to give a breath sample in accordance with South\r\n  Carolina Code section 56-5-2950(a).Â  The hearing officerâ€™s order sustained the\r\n  suspension reasoning â€œ[Peake] verbally refused to give a blood or urine sample,\r\n  as he was unable to give a breath sample.â€\r\nPeake\r\n  next appealed to the Court of Common Pleas in Charleston County where he complained\r\n  Trooper Manleyâ€™s testimony did not justify the request for a blood sample.Â \r\n  Peake contended section 56-5-2950(a) requires law enforcement to seek the\r\n  opinion of a medical professional that a person is incapable of providing a\r\n  breath test.Â  The Department argued Peake was improperly shifting the burden of\r\n  proof, the Departmentâ€™s actions were presumably correct pursuant to the\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act, and the recordâ€™s substantial evidence supported\r\n  the hearing officerâ€™s findings.Â   \r\nIn its\r\n  written order, the circuit court interpreted section 56-5-2950(a) to â€œrequire\r\n  the opinion of a medical professional if the subject is unable to give a breath\r\n  sample for some reason outside those enumerated by the statute (e.g. injured\r\n  mouth, unconscious, dead).â€Â  However, the judge then affirmed the suspension\r\n  concluding â€œunder these facts, the officer was not required to seek the opinion\r\n  of a medical professional as to Petitionerâ€™s ability to give a breath sample.â€Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures\r\n  Act, S.C. Code Ann. section 1-23-310, et seq.,\r\n  (2005), establishes the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ rule as the standard for\r\n  judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.Â  Lark v.

Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (2006).\r\n\r\n\tSection 56-5-2950(a) states in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tA person who drives a motor vehicle in\r\n  this State is considered to have given consent to chemical tests of his breath,\r\n  blood, or urine for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol or drugs\r\n  or the combination of alcohol and drugs if arrested for an offense arising out\r\n  of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving a motor\r\n  vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of\r\n  alcohol and drugs.Â  A breath test must be administered at the direction of a\r\n  law enforcement officer who has arrested a person for driving a motor vehicle\r\n  in this State while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of\r\n  alcohol and drugs. Â At the direction of the arresting officer, the\r\n    person first must be offered a breath test to determine the personâ€™s alcohol\r\n    concentration.Â  If the person is physically unable to provide an acceptable\r\n    breath sample because he has an injured mouth, is unconscious or dead, or for\r\n    any other reason considered acceptable by the licensed medical personnel, the\r\n    arresting officer may request a blood sample to be taken. \r\n\t&nbsp;â€¦\r\n\tNo test may be administered or samples obtained unless\r\n  the person has been informed in writing that:\r\n\t(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; he does not have to\r\n  take the test or give the samples, but that his privilege to drive must be\r\n  suspended or denied for at least ninety days if he refuses to submit to the\r\n  tests and that his refusal may be used against him in court;\r\n\t(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; his privilege to drive\r\n  must be suspended for at least thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the\r\n  samples and has an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one\r\n  percent or more;\r\n\t(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; he has the right to\r\n  have a qualified person of his own choosing conduct additional independent\r\n  tests at his expense;\r\n\t(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; he has the right to\r\n  request an administrative hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the\r\n  notice of suspension; and\r\n\t(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; if he does not request\r\n  an administrative hearing or if his suspension is upheld at the administrative\r\n  hearing, he must enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nUnder\r\n  section 56-5-2951(A), the Department of Motor Vehicles must suspend the license\r\n  of anyone who drives a motor vehicle and refuses to submit to a test provided\r\n  for in section 56-5-2950 or who takes the test and registers an alcohol\r\n  concentration of at least fifteen percent.Â  A person issued a notice of\r\n  suspension may request an administrative hearing within thirty days.Â  S.C.

App.\r\n  2005).\r\nII.&nbsp; Rules\r\n  of Statutory Construction\r\nThe\r\n  primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intent of legislature.Â  Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 108, 536 S.E.2d\r\n  372, 375 (2000); Shealy v. Doe, 370 S.C. 194, 199, 634 S.E.2d 45, 48 (Ct. App. 2006); City of Camden v. Brassel, 326 S.C. 556, 560, 486 S.E.2d 492, 494\r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The first inquiry is whether the statuteâ€™s meaning is clear\r\n  on its face.Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d\r\n  586, 588 (2002); Eagle Container Co., L.L.C. v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 622, 622 S.E.2d 733, 738 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  With any question\r\n  regarding statutory construction and application, the court must always look to\r\n  legislative intent as determined from the plain language of the statute.Â  State\r\n    v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2002); State v. Frey,\r\n  362 S.C. 511, 516, 608 S.E.2d 874, 877 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Morgan,\r\n  352 S.C. 359, 365-66, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002).Â   \r\nWhen a\r\n  statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite\r\n  meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed, and this court has\r\n  no right to impose another meaning.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372 S.C. 519, ___, 642 S.E.2d 751, 754 (2007); Vaughan v. Bernhardt, 345 S.C. 196, 198, 547 S.E.2d 869, 870 (2001).Â  â€œ[T]he\r\n  words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s\r\n  operation.â€Â  Mun.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 230,\r\n  612 S.E.2d 719, 723 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing State v. Landis, 362 S.C.\r\n  97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  The text of a statute is considered the\r\n  best evidence of the legislative intent or will.Â  Jones, 364 S.C. at\r\n  231, 612 S.E.2d at 724 (citing Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  The language must be\r\n  read to harmonize with its subject matter and in accord with its general\r\n  purpose.Â  Jones, 364 S.C. at 230, 612 S.E.2d at 723 (citing Hitachi Data Sys. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992)).Â  The courtâ€™s primary function in interpreting a statue is to determine\r\n  the intent of the General Assembly. Â Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co.,\r\n  350 S.C. 82, 87, 564 S.E.2d 358, 361 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œOnce the legislature\r\n  has made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different\r\n  judgment based upon their own notions of public policy.â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nIf the language of an act creates doubt or uncertainty as to\r\n  legislative intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the\r\n  borders of the act itself.Â  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 367, 574\r\n  S.E.2d 203, 207 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive\r\n  practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose,\r\n  design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  Collins Music Co., Inc. v. IGT, 365\r\n  S.C. 544, 550, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct.

Co. v Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000)); Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc.,\r\n  312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)).Â  A court should not consider a\r\n  particular clause in a statute in isolation, but should read it in conjunction\r\n  with the purpose of the entire statute and the policy of the law.Â  Hinton v.\r\n    South Carolina Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole, and Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327,\r\n  333, 592 S.E.2d 335, 338 (Ct.

App. 2003).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Compliance\r\n  with Section 56-5-2950(a)\r\nThe plain language of section 56-5-2950(a) permits an arresting\r\n  officer to request a blood sample but unambiguously limits this to situations\r\n  where a person is physically unable to provide a breath sample due to an\r\n  injured mouth, unconsciousness or death, or for any other reason considered\r\n  acceptable by the licensed medical personnel. Â Â In the case at bar, the\r\n  Department has not asserted Peake had an injured mouth or was unconscious.Â \r\n  Therefore, the Department was required under the implied consent statute to\r\n  show Peake was physically unable to give an acceptable breath sample for a\r\n  reason found acceptable by licensed medical personnel.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Stacy, 315 S.C. 105, 431 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 1993) this court held the\r\n  state complied with the licensed medical personnel determination requirement of\r\n  section 56-5-2950(a). Stacy led police on a high speed chase that ended in a\r\n  crash killing one person and injuring several others.Â  He appealed his\r\n  convictions for two felony DUI counts and failure to stop for a police vehicle\r\n  arguing his blood sample should have been suppressed because the State had not\r\n  complied with section 56-5-2950(a).\r\nReading the statute as a whole, this court held â€œthe statute\r\n  requires a licensed physician, licensed registered nurse, or other medical\r\n  personnel trained to take blood samples â€¦ to determine whether an acceptable\r\n  reason exists for finding that a person is unable to provide an acceptable\r\n  breath sample.â€Â  Id. at 107, 431 S.E.2d at 641; (citing State v.\r\n    Baker, 310 S.C. 510, 427 S.E.2d 670 (1993)).Â  The trained medical person\r\n  who drew the blood testified Stacy was unable to provide a breath sample\r\n  because he had not yet been treated and could not be transported to the law\r\n  enforcement center. Â Because the evidence established the medical person\r\n  considered this an acceptable reason, we found the statute permitted the taking\r\n  of a blood sample without first offering a breath test.Â  Id.  \r\nThis\r\n  court considered compliance with section 56-5-2950(a) and suppression of blood\r\n  test results in City of Columbia v. Moore, 318 S.C. 292, 457 S.E.2d 346\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Moore was involved in a car accident, placed under arrest at\r\n  the scene, and transported to the hospital in full spinal precautions.Â  The\r\n  arresting officer testified he ordered the blood sample after being informed Moore could be in the hospital all night.Â  Finding the City failed to present any evidence\r\n  of compliance with the procedure set forth in section 56-5-2950(a), this court\r\n  noted â€œit is undisputed Moore did not have an injury to the mouth and was\r\n  conscious at all times.Â  Therefore, the City was required to present evidence Moore was physically unable to give an acceptable breath sample for a reason found\r\n  acceptable by licensed medical personnel.â€Â  Id. at 295, 457 S.E.2d at\r\n  347.Â   \r\nThe City alleged the arresting officerâ€™s belief Moore would remain\r\n  at the hospital a long time, coupled with the circumstances of his transport, provided\r\n  a sufficient basis to conclude Moore was physically unable to give a breath\r\n  sample.Â  This court answered â€œ[h]owever reasonable these conclusions may be\r\n  under the circumstances, they are legally insufficient.â€Â  Id.Â  We\r\n  explicated:\r\n\r\n\tTo allow the arresting officer to make the\r\n  determination that a person is physically unable to give an acceptable breath\r\n  sample, absent an injured mouth, unconsciousness, or death, is a relaxation of\r\n  the plain requirement of the statute, and would allow the substitution of the\r\n  officerâ€™s judgment for that of licensed medical personnel.\r\n\r\nId. at 295, 457 S.E.2d at 348.Â  The City further averred Moore consented to the taking of a blood sample, but we elucidated: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t[A driverâ€™s implied] consent is only to chemical tests under the\r\n  procedure plainly set forth in the statute.Â  The penalty for refusal to submit\r\n  to testing is the administrative loss of license for ninety (90) days. â€¦. In\r\n  view of this statute, it would be pure legal fiction to infer Mooreâ€™s â€˜consentâ€™\r\n  at the hospital was a voluntary relinquishment of his right to require compliance\r\n  with the statute as written.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nAlthough\r\n  this court acknowledged the inability to leave a medical facility could provide a legally sufficient basis to conclude a person was physically\r\n  incapable of providing a breath sample, we required â€œthe evidence must establish the reason a blood test was ordered in lieu of a breath sample is for\r\n  a reason found acceptable by licensed medical personnel.â€Â  Id. (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Kimbrell, 326 S.C. 344, 481 S.E.2d 456 (Ct. App. 1997), this court again\r\n  found noncompliance with section 56-5-2950.Â  Kimbrell was involved in a one car\r\n  accident and taken to the hospital.Â  As she was leaving the hospital, the\r\n  responding officer asked her to submit to a blood test.Â  The defendantâ€™s\r\n  husband testified she had no injury to her mouth which prevented giving a\r\n  breath sample.Â  The officer told the court she had a small amount of blood in\r\n  her teeth.Â  Kimbrell consented to the blood test.Â  The officer did not offer or\r\n  discuss a breath test with Kimbrell, ask about the condition of her mouth, or\r\n  attempt to determine the extent of any injury.Â  Accordingly, the test results\r\n  were suppressed because the record lacked sufficient evidence to support the\r\n  officerâ€™s decision not to offer a breath test.Â  We inculcated:\r\n\r\n\tUnlike a breath test, the blood test is physically invasive.Â  By\r\n  enacting the implied consent statute, the legislature clearly intended to\r\n  protect against this invasion where it is used simply as a convenience to the\r\n  arresting officer, absent the agreement of the accused.Â  There can be no valid\r\n  agreement where the accused is not advised of his or her right to a breath test\r\n  instead of a blood test.\r\n\r\nId., 326 S.C. at 348, 481 S.E.2d at 458-59; see also Taylor v. State, 368 S.C. 33, 627 S.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. granted (explaining implied consent laws attempt to\r\n  balance the interest of the State in maintaining safe highways with the\r\n  interest of the individual in maintaining personal autonomy free from arbitrary\r\n  or overbearing state action).Â  Relying heavily on the precedent of Moore, we determined â€œthe plain meaning of the statute requires the arresting\r\n  officer to offer a breath test, absent a valid determination that the defendant\r\n  is physically unable to give an acceptable breath sample.â€Â  Id. at 348,\r\n  481 S.E.2d at 459.Â   \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Long, 363 S.C. 360, 610 S.E.2d 809 (2005), our supreme court highlighted\r\n  the requirements of section 56-5-2950 in order to distinguish section 56-5-2946.\r\n  Â When the implied consent laws were rewritten by 1998 Act No. 434, section 7,\r\n  section 56-5-2946, entitled â€œSubmission to testing for alcohol or drugs,â€ was\r\n  created and applies only to persons believed to have committed Felony DUI.Â  The\r\n  court found section 56-5-2946 removed the general requirements that an officer must\r\n  first offer a breath test or get a medical opinion a breath test is not possible\r\n  before ordering a blood test.Â  While hospitalized following a single car\r\n  accident which killed a passenger, a blood sample was drawn from Long at the\r\n  request of an officer.Â  Long objected to the introduction of the test results\r\n  at trial because he had not been offered a breath test and no licensed medical\r\n  personnel determined he was unable to provide a breath sample.Â  A study of the\r\n  language of section 56-2-2946 led the court to conclude:\r\n\r\n\t[The first] two paragraphs essentially\r\n  alter the procedural prerequisites which must be met under Â§ 56-5-2950 before\r\n  an officer may order a blood test for a Felony DUI suspect.Â  Under Â§ 56-5-2946,\r\n  the officer need no longer offer a breath test as the first option, nor must he\r\n  obtain a medical opinion that such a test is not feasible before ordering a\r\n  test or sample.\r\n\r\nId. at 363, 610 S.E.2d at 811.Â  See also State v.\r\n  Cuevas, 365 S.C. 198, 616 S.E.2d 718 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding under section\r\n  56-5-2950(a), unlike section 56-5-2946, arresting officer must first offer\r\n  breath test).Â   \r\nIn the case sub judice, Peake was not suspected of\r\n  felony DUI and the parties concede no breath test was first offered.Â  Apodictically,\r\n  under section 56-5-2950(a), Trooper Manley could only have requested a blood\r\n  sample if Peake was physically unable to provide a breath sample due to an\r\n  injured mouth, unconsciousness, death, or for any other reason considered\r\n  acceptable by the licensed medical personnel.Â  The record contains no\r\n  substantial evidence supporting any of these exceptions. Indeed, the uncontested\r\n  facts show the administrative hearing officer and the circuit court relied only\r\n  on an unsubstantiated reason considered acceptable by Trooper Manley.  \r\nThe Department asserts â€œa reasonable mind could concludeâ€¦that\r\n  [Peake] was â€˜unable to give a breath sample.â€™â€Â  In Moore, we established\r\n  this conclusion, â€œhowever reasonable,â€ was legally insufficient because section\r\n  56-5-2950(a) plainly establishes the determination of the licensed medical\r\n  personnel is the standard.\r\nThe Department additionally contends that because a person cannot\r\n  be transported from a medical facility to the locale of a DataMaster until\r\n  released by licensed medical personnel, the statutory requirement of a medical\r\n  opinion is necessarily satisfied â€œevery single time a motorist is taken to a\r\n  medical facility for treatment and is not soon thereafter discharged.â€Â  The\r\n  Department limits application of this notion to administrative hearings.Â  We are\r\n  unaware of any statutory or jurisprudential basis for this proposition.Â \r\n  Although this court in Moore held the inability to leave a medical\r\n  facility could form a legally sufficient basis for ordering a blood test, we\r\n  expounded the record must show this determination is based on the opinion of\r\n  licensed medical personnel.Â   \r\nSection 56-5-2950(a) clearly articulates the statutory structure\r\n  for chemical testing to which drivers impliedly consent. The record is\r\n  absolutely devoid of any evidence showing Trooper Manley met the statutory\r\n  requirements before requesting a blood test, therefore we find the decisions of\r\n  the administrative hearing officer and the circuit court are clearly erroneous. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough the administrative hearing officer correctly concluded\r\n  Peake was lawfully arrested, advised of his section 56-5-2950 rights, and refused\r\n  to submit to a test, no substantial evidence shows the Department honored these\r\n  rights in accordance with statutory provisions.Â  Therefore, the findings of the\r\n  administrative hearing officer and the circuit court judge are  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4314","title":"McGriff v.

Pleasant for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: Â Worsley Companies, Inc. appeals the circuit court order affirming\r\n  the order of the appellate panel of the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission finding\r\n  Jamar W. McGriffâ€™s injury compensable.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  September 5, 2001, McGriff applied for a job with Worsley Companies, doing\r\n  business as Scotchman Stores, at store #98 on the corner of Remount Road and North Rhett Avenue in Charleston.Â  In the interim between the submission of his application\r\n  and his eventual hiring at Scotchman, McGriff met David W. Chennault, a\r\n  neighbor of McGriffâ€™s friend.Â  At the time of their acquaintance, both McGriff\r\n  and Chennault were seeking employment and went â€œjob huntingâ€ together by\r\n  submitting applications to various stores located on Remount Road.Â  On December\r\n  19, 2001, Chennault submitted an application at store #98.Â  After submitting\r\n  his application to Scotchman, Chennault was hired as a salesman for Country Fed\r\n  Meats in Hanahan, South Carolina.Â  Subsequently, Chennault assisted McGriff in\r\n  securing employment with the same company.Â  However, according to Chennaultâ€™s\r\n  testimony, McGriff worked at Country Fed Meats for only a short time.Â   \r\nI.&nbsp; McGriffâ€™s\r\n  Employment and Related Responsibilities\r\nIn early\r\n  February 2002, McGriff accepted a position at store #98 as a third-shift sales\r\n  clerk. Â According to the Scotchman\r\n  Standard Duty List, third-shift clerks are required to complete numerous duties\r\n  outside the physical confines of the store.Â  In particular, McGriff was\r\n  expected to excel in his efforts to maintain the cleanliness of the outside\r\n  premises as part of Scotchmanâ€™s â€œPride Rideâ€ program.Â  In addition,\r\n  Scotchmanâ€™s â€œNew Beginning Training Manualâ€ required sales clerks to â€œ[a]lways\r\n  keep applications on the [sales counter] and offer them to people you feel\r\n  would be beneficial to Scotchman Stores.â€  \r\nII.&nbsp; McGriffâ€™s\r\n  Accident\r\nOn\r\n  February 9, 2002, at around 5:00 a.m., Chennault stopped his company truck at\r\n  the intersection in front of the store, and saw McGriff outside cleaning the\r\n  parking lot.[1]Â \r\n  Having recently worked at Country Fed Meats, McGriff apparently noticed the\r\n  company truck stopped at the intersection and recognized Chennault as the\r\n  driver.Â  Given the â€œnon-existentâ€ traffic at the time, McGriff crossed the\r\n  storeâ€™s parking lot and entered the intersection to speak with Chennault.Â  McGriff\r\n  stood at Chennaultâ€™s truck window approximately 12 to 15 feet from the curb of\r\n  the Scotchman parking lot.  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Chennault, McGriff entered the intersection to inform Chennault that he had been\r\n  hired by Scotchman.Â  Chennault asked McGriff whether McGriff would follow up on\r\n  Chennaultâ€™s application.Â  In response, McGriff indicated he would speak with\r\n  the store manager on Chennaultâ€™s behalf. Â As he turned to go back to the store,\r\n  McGriff was struck by an oncoming car.Â   \r\nIII.&nbsp; The Appellate\r\n  Panel and Circuit Court Findings \r\nBefore\r\n  the single commissioner, the parties stipulated to a bifurcation of the claim\r\n  so that compensability alone was the subject of the initial hearing. The single\r\n  commissioner found McGriff had sustained a compensable injury as his actions\r\n  were not a substantial deviation from his employment and because he was acting\r\n  in the interest of his employer when he left the storeâ€™s premises.Â   \r\n\r\n\tThe appellate\r\n  panel affirmed the decision, stating:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tClaimant\r\n  had not abandoned his job.Â  He was not violating any company policy . . . .Â  There\r\n  was no written prohibition against the Claimant leaving the store to clean the\r\n  parking lot.Â  Further, there was the affirmative written expectation that the\r\n  Claimant would assist his employer in finding applicants he felt would be\r\n  beneficial to the company.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe circuit\r\n  court affirmed the appellate panelâ€™s order that found â€œboth the reason the\r\n  claimant was outside and the reason he stepped into the intersection were\r\n  specifically authorized and expected by his employer; even if the location was\r\n  not.â€Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally,\r\n  a reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the appellate panel unless\r\n  the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an\r\n  error of law.Â  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury\r\n    Fund, 365 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œSubstantial\r\n  evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached\r\n  to justify its action.â€Â  Howell v. Pac. Columbia Mills, 291 S.C.\r\n  469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  question of whether an accident arises out of and is in the course and scope of\r\n  employment is largely a question of fact.Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg County Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Where facts are disputed, the findings\r\n  of the appellate panel are conclusive.Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349\r\n  S.C. 451, 454-55, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, where the facts are undisputed, the question of whether an\r\n  accident is compensable under workersâ€™ compensation law is a question of law.Â  Grant\r\n    v. Grant Textiles,\r\n  372 S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 872 (2007).Â  While the appellate courts are\r\n  required to be deferential to the appellate panel regarding questions of fact,\r\n  such deference does not prevent the courts from overturning the Panelâ€™s\r\n  decision when it is legally incorrect.Â  Id. at 202, 641 S.E.2d at 872.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Injury Arising out\r\n  of Employment \r\nScotchman\r\n  argues the appellate panel and circuit court erred in finding McGriffâ€™s injury\r\n  compensable, because McGriffâ€™s injury did not arise out of his employment or\r\n  occur during the course and scope of his employment.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  order to be entitled to compensation for an injury under the South Carolina\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, a claimant must show he suffered an â€œinjury by\r\n  accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-160 (Supp. 2006).Â  However, â€œ[t]he two parts of the phrase â€˜arising out of\r\n  and in the course of employmentâ€™ are not synonymous.â€ Â Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 49, 508 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1998).\r\n  Rather, â€œ[b]oth parts must exist simultaneously before any court will allow\r\n  recovery.â€ Â Id. Â According to this court in Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone\r\n    Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 161, 584 S.E.2d 390, 394 (Ct. App. 2003) (internal\r\n  citations omitted):\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  term â€œarising out ofâ€ refers to the origin of the cause of the accident. An\r\n  accidental injury is considered to arise out of oneâ€™s employment when there is\r\n  a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to\r\n  be performed and the resulting injury. An injury occurs within the course of\r\n  employment when it occurs within the period of employment, at a place where the\r\n  employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties, and while\r\n  fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incidental thereto. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n  an injury must both â€œarise out ofâ€ and occur â€œin the course ofâ€ employment to\r\n  recover for the injury, â€œ[t]here are circumstances when injuries arising out of\r\n  acts outside the scope of an employeeâ€™s regular duties may be compensable. Â These\r\n  circumstances have been applied to: Â (1) acts benefiting co-employees; (2) acts\r\n  benefiting customers or strangers; (3) acts benefiting the claimant; and (4)\r\n  acts benefiting the employer privately.â€Â  Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372\r\n  S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007).Â  Furthermore, an act outside an employeeâ€™s regular\r\n  duties that is undertaken in good faith to advance\r\n  the employerâ€™s interest, whether or not the employeeâ€™s own assigned work is\r\n  thereby furthered, is within the course of employment.Â  Id. at 202, 641 S.E.2d at 872.Â  \r\n \r\nThus,\r\n  in determining whether an accident arose out of and in the course of\r\n  employment, each case must be decided with reference to its own attendant\r\n  circumstances.Â  Lanford v. Clinton Cotton Mills, 204 S.C. 423, 425, 30\r\n  S.E.2d 36, 38 (1944). Â Moreover, the general policy in South Carolina â€œis to\r\n  construe the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in favor of coverage rather than\r\n  exclusion.â€Â  Baggot v. So. Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 5, 496 S.E.2d 852,\r\n  854 (1998).  \r\nIn Grant v.\r\n  Grant Textiles,\r\n  372 S.C. 196, 198-99, 641 S.E.2d 869, 870 (2007), the\r\n  claimant, vice-president of sales for a family-owned textile company, was traveling\r\n  to a meeting with clients when he stopped to remove debris from along the\r\n  highway near the entrance to the site of the meeting.Â  Claimant was struck by a\r\n  passing vehicle, and the court found his injury compensable.Â  Id., 372\r\n  S.C. at 198-200, 641 S.E.2d at 870-72. Â According to the court, â€œthe full\r\n  commission [of the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission] erred by finding that the\r\n  accident did not have a causal connection with [Grantâ€™s] employment.Â  The\r\n  accident would not have happened but for [his] business trip . . . to meet his\r\n  employerâ€™s customers.â€Â  Id. at 201-202, 641 S.E.2d at 872.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the record contains ample\r\n  evidence substantiating the causal connection between the conditions under\r\n  which McGriffâ€™s work was required to be performed and his resulting injury. Â As evidenced by the record: Â (1) at the time McGriff entered the road to engage in conversation\r\n  with Chennault, McGriff was allowed and expected to be outside; (2) McGriff was\r\n  allowed and expected to solicit new employees; (3) McGriff was allowed and\r\n  expected to communicate inquiries to the store manager regarding employee\r\n  prospects; and (4) McGriff was acting in good faith in the interest of his\r\n  employer when he entered the road to discuss employment with Chennault.Â  There\r\n  is substantial evidence in the record\r\n  to support the determination that but for his employment with Scotchman,\r\n  McGriff would not have entered the highway. Â McGriff knew the store was\r\n  understaffed and knew Chennault was desirous of employment there.Â Â Â  According\r\n  to Chennaultâ€™s testimony, the only thing the two discussed during their brief\r\n  conversation was employment at Scotchman store #98.Â  Because there is\r\n  substantial evidence in the record to support the findings, we cannot conclude\r\n  that the appellate panel or circuit court erred\r\n  in finding McGriffâ€™s injury arose out of his employment.  \r\nII.&nbsp; Injury Occurring in\r\n  the Course of Employment\r\nScotchman\r\n  also contends the appellate panel and circuit court erred in finding McGriffâ€™s\r\n  injury compensable because McGriffâ€™s departure from the storeâ€™s premises\r\n  constitutes a substantial deviation outside the course of his employment.Â  We\r\n  disagree.  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  an employee need not be in the actual performance of the duties for which he\r\n  was expressly employed in order for his injury to be in the course of employment.\r\n  Â See Beam v. State Workmenâ€™s Compensation Fund, 261 S.C. 327, 332,\r\n  200 S.E.2d 83, 86 (1973) (noting â€œ[i]t is sufficient if the employee is engaged\r\n  in a pursuit or undertaking consistent with his contract of hire and which in\r\n  some logical manner pertains to or is incidental to his employment.â€).Â  As our\r\n  supreme court noted in Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 190, 528\r\n  S.E.2d 435, 444 (2000), â€œ[s]ince South Carolina does not look to fault, [the\r\n  employeeâ€™s violation of a rule of conduct] must be a substantial deviation to\r\n  remove his actions from the course of his employment, and disallow recovery of\r\n  benefits.â€Â  Accordingly,  \r\n\r\n\t[W]hen\r\n  an employee is in the performance of the duties of the employer, the fact that\r\n  the injury was sustained while performing the duty in an unauthorized manner or\r\n  in violation of instruction or rules of the employer does not make the injury\r\n  one incurred outside the scope of employment. \r\n\r\nId. at 190-191, 528 S.E.2d at 444 (citing Arthur Larson\r\n  &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 37.02 (1999)).  \r\nThe\r\n  record does not support Scotchmanâ€™s contention that McGriff abandoned his\r\n  employment.Â  Although he technically left the boundaries of Scotchmanâ€™s\r\n  premises, the fact that McGriff was outside of the store does not in and of\r\n  itself violate any company rule.Â  Furthermore, according to Chennaultâ€™s testimony, McGriff was constantly glancing\r\n  back toward the store during their conversation.Â  The situs of the conversation\r\n  was approximately 12-15 feet from the Scotchman parking lot, and the\r\n  conversation was as brief as the time of one cycle of the traffic signal at the\r\n  intersection.Â  Thus, while McGriff may have deviated slightly from the general\r\n  location of his job responsibilities, the record supports that such deviation\r\n  was not so substantial as to remove him from the course and scope of his\r\n  employment.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  hold neither the appellate panel nor the circuit court erred in finding McGriffâ€™s injury compensable.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Chennaultâ€™s\r\n  Testimony\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Scotchman argues the appellate panel erred in relying on a hand-written\r\n  affidavit from Chennault that was previously excluded by the single commissioner\r\n  as inadmissible hearsay.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  record shows Chennault gave a statement to investigating officers the day of\r\n  McGriffâ€™s accident generally indicating that he and McGriff were talking about\r\n  their new jobs at the time of the accident.Â  He apparently provided a\r\n  hand-written affidavit approximately four days later. Â However, as the circuit\r\n  court noted, â€œthere is no mention in the [Appellate Panelâ€™s] Decision and Order\r\n  of reliance upon the excluded statement, only an acknowledgment that it\r\n  existed.â€Â  Rather, the appellate panel only details the single commissionerâ€™s\r\n  findings as to the first statement Chennault gave to police.Â  Because the\r\n  record reflects no reference to the appellate panelâ€™s reliance upon Chennaultâ€™s\r\n  second hand-written statement in making any determination of fact or conclusion\r\n  of law, we hold the appellate panel did not err in relying on Chennaultâ€™s testimony.[2]\r\nIV.&nbsp; Witness Credibility \r\n\r\nFinally,\r\n  Scotchman maintains the appellate panel erred in finding Chennault was a\r\n  credible witness while two of their witnesses were not.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  noted by our supreme court in Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455,\r\n  535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000), the final determination of witness credibility and\r\n  the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the findings of the appellate panel are presumed correct and will be set aside\r\n  only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Â Frame v. Resort Serv., Inc.,\r\n  357 S.C. 520, 528, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (2004).Â  Furthermore, the possibility of\r\n  drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the appellate\r\n  panelâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v.\r\n    Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999). \r\n \r\nCross-examination\r\n  of Chennault revealed he had exaggerated positive information on his employment\r\n  application as well as lied about being fired from his previous job.Â  In\r\n  addition, Chennault did not reveal any prior arrests on his application\r\n  although he had bee previously arrested.Â  Nevertheless, the record shows\r\n  Chennault and McGriff had a history of trying to assist one another with\r\n  employment opportunities, and Chennaultâ€™s initial statement to police following\r\n  the accident is consistent with his more detailed deposition testimony.Â \r\n \r\nScotchmanâ€™s\r\n  witness, Joseph Turner, observed the accident from a nearby Food Lion parking\r\n  lot.Â  Turner indicated multiple times during his testimony that he was not â€œpay[ing]\r\n  attentionâ€ to the specifics of the incident.Â  Leslie Flowers, the Scotchman store\r\n  manager, gave testimony regarding the companyâ€™s policies and her own\r\n  instructions to her employees about leaving the store that was arguably\r\n  inconsistent.Â  Based on the record, we cannot conclude the appellate panel\r\n  erred in making its findings on the credibility of these witnesses.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we hold neither the appellate panel nor the circuit court erred\r\n  in finding McGriffâ€™s injury compensable under South Carolinaâ€™s Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act.Â  The decision of the appellate panel and the circuit court is\r\n  accordingly\r\n&nbsp;AFFIRMED.\r\n&nbsp;SHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; According to the testimony of Leslie\r\n  Flowers, McGriff was notÂ  scheduled to work that shift but was called in due to\r\n  the store being understaffed. Â \r\n[2]&nbsp; Sligh v. Newberry Elec.

Joyner were involved in an automobile\r\n  accident in Georgetown, South Carolina.Â  As a result of injuries sustained in\r\n  the accident, Todd brought this action.Â  Joyner stipulated to her negligence in\r\n  the case.[2]\r\nOn February 27, 2006, Joyner made Dr. Richard J. Friedman available for deposition as an expert in the field of orthopedic\r\n  surgery.Â  Friedman was not available to testify live at the trial, and a\r\n  redacted version of his deposition was read into evidence.Â  During the\r\n  deposition, Todd questioned Friedman extensively about his private practice,\r\n  the amount of his practice Friedman devoted to testifying as an expert witness,\r\n  and the percentage of his income that came from testifying as an expert in an\r\n  average year.Â  \r\nFriedman could not recall specifics in his\r\n  responses at the time of the deposition, and Todd subsequently subpoenaed\r\n  records from State Farm Insurance Company regarding payments made to Friedman.Â \r\n  The records showed payments of between $50,000 and $60,000 to Friedman for the\r\n  calendar years 2003 through 2005.Â  The trial court denied their admission into\r\n  evidence because of the prejudicial impact of injecting insurance into the\r\n  proceeding.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Todd objected to Friedmanâ€™s\r\n  use of Toddâ€™s medical records as the foundation of his testimony as well as\r\n  Friedmanâ€™s occasional reference to those records in his deposition.Â  The trial\r\n  court overruled this objection.Â  Finally, Todd attempted to introduce, through\r\n  cross-examination, a covenant not to execute entered into by Todd and State\r\n  Farm.Â  The trial court denied the covenantâ€™s introduction.Â  The jury awarded\r\n  Todd $37,191.11, the exact amount of her medical bills.Â  Todd made a timely\r\n  motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motion, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Admission of\r\n  Evidence of Expertâ€™s Connection to State Farm\r\nTodd\r\n  maintains the court improperly excluded evidence of the prior payments State Farm made to Friedman, which would be evidence of bias in favor of the\r\n  defendant.[3]Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467,\r\n  611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is\r\n  based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.\r\nHistorically, South Carolina restricted the admission\r\n  into evidence of defendantsâ€™ insurance against potential liability in an action\r\n  for damages before a jury.Â  Dunn v. Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, 45, 426 S.E.2d 756, 757 (1993).Â  The reasoning behind this rule was\r\n  to avoid prejudice in the verdict, which might result from the juryâ€™s knowledge\r\n  that insurance, and not the defendant, would\r\n  be responsible for paying any resulting award of damages.Â  Id. at 45,\r\n  426 S.E.2d at 757-58.Â  However, â€œRule 411 modified this rule by providing that\r\n  the admissibility of evidence of insurance depends upon the purpose for which\r\n  such evidence is introduced.â€Â  Yoho v. Thompson, 345 S.C. 361, 365, 548\r\n  S.E.2d 584, 585 (2001).Â  Rule 411 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\tEvidence that a person was or was not insured against\r\n  liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently\r\n  or otherwise wrongfully. Â This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence\r\n  of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof\r\n  of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.\r\n\r\nBecause Joyner stipulated to negligence, the records\r\n  were not being offered to show that she was at fault.Â  Rather Todd sought to\r\n  use them to discredit the defense expertâ€™s testimony. \r\nIn Yoho\r\n  v. Thompson, 345 S.C. 361, 365-66,\r\n  548 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2001) the court explained if Rule 411 does not require the\r\n  exclusion of the insurance evidence, and we find in this case it does not, the\r\n  court must then consider whether the probative value of the evidence\r\n  substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect and any potential confusion for\r\n  the jury under Rule 403.Â  In order to accomplish this analysis, South Carolina has adopted the â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ test to determine whether an\r\n  expertâ€™s connection to a defendantâ€™s insurer is sufficiently probative to\r\n  outweigh the prejudice to the defendant resulting from the juryâ€™s knowledge\r\n  that the defendant carries liability insurance.Â  Id. at 366, 548 S.E.2d\r\n  at 586 (citing Bonser v. Shainholtz, 3 P.3d 422 (Colo. 2000); Mills\r\n    v. Grotheer, 957 P.2d 540 (Okla. 1998)).Â  The substantial connection test\r\n  has been adopted by a majority of the jurisdictions that have addressed this\r\n  issue and is based upon the degree of connection between the expert and the\r\n  insurance company.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe court in Yoho did not articulate a defined\r\n  test, but instead described the characteristics present in the case that led it\r\n  to the conclusion a substantial connection existed, and ultimately that the\r\n  evidence of bias should come in.Â  These characteristics included:Â  (1) the\r\n  expert maintained an employment relationship with insurance companies; (2) the\r\n  expert consulted for the insurance company in question in other cases and gave\r\n  lectures to its agents and adjusters; (3) ten to twenty percent of the expertâ€™s\r\n  practice consisted of reviewing records for insurance companies; and (4) the\r\n  expertâ€™s yearly salary was based in part on his insurance consulting work.Â  Id.Â  Further, the Yoho court specifically found the expert â€œwas not merely\r\n  being paid an expertâ€™s fee in this matter.â€Â  Id. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court distinguished Yoho from this case in several important\r\n  aspects.Â  First, the court found it significant the expert in Yoho was\r\n  present for live testimony during the trial.Â  This allowed the expert to be\r\n  confronted about his connection to the insurance industry, instead of merely\r\n  submitting an itemized list of payments into evidence.Â  As described above,\r\n  Friedman was not available for cross-examination at trial.Â  Friedman could have\r\n  been cross-examined with the records at his deposition, but Todd had not\r\n  acquired the records at that point in time.Â  We also note Friedmanâ€™s bias was\r\n  presented for the juryâ€™s consideration as his deposition testimony was read\r\n  into the record.Â  This recitation included the extensive cross-examination by\r\n  Todd bringing out the issue of potential bias.Â  As a result, the actual record\r\n  of payments became less probative.\r\nNext,\r\n  the circuit court did not feel Friedmanâ€™s relationship with State Farm rose to\r\n  the level described in Yoho because the only available evidence of his\r\n  connection to State Farm was an itemized list of payments totaling between\r\n  fifty and sixty thousand dollars over the course of three years.Â  The court\r\n  found significant that no witnesses, including the two State Farm employees\r\n  Todd called, could explain why these payments to Friedman were made.Â  The\r\n  combination of these factors led the circuit court to conclude â€œthe prejudicial\r\n  effect of injecting this insurance information into this case greatly outweighs\r\n  the probative value because . . . thereâ€™s no opportunity to really do anything\r\n  probative with this information; and itâ€™s really open to great latitude for\r\n  abuse.â€Â  We find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in so holding.\r\nII.&nbsp; Covenant\r\n  Not to Execute\r\nTodd\r\n  next contends the circuit court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the\r\n  covenant between Todd and State Farm.Â  We disagree.\r\nTodd relies upon the lone South Carolina decision\r\n  addressing the admissibility of a covenant not to execute, Poston v. Barnes,\r\n  294 S.C. 261, 363 S.E.2d 888 (1987).Â  In Poston, the plaintiff was\r\n  injured when another driver struck a school van in which the plaintiff was a\r\n  passenger.Â  The plaintiff, driver defendant, and the defendantâ€™s insurance\r\n  company entered into a covenant not to execute.Â  Id. at 263, 363 S.E.2d\r\n  at 889.Â  This covenant limited the defendant driverâ€™s liability for damages,\r\n  while requiring her to remain a co-defendant, along with the school district,\r\n  outwardly still subject to joint and several liability.Â  Id. at 265, 363\r\n  S.E.2d at 890.Â  The court found the covenant was a facade, and the failure to\r\n  disclose it to the jury tainted the judicial process.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\t[T]he jury was denied\r\n  information to which it was entitled as to the sources of remuneration\r\n  available to the plaintiff and by whom such remuneration would be paid.Â  The\r\n  fact that the agreement was not disclosed to the jury in this instance facilitates\r\n  inequity and injustice in the judicial process. . . .Â  Under the circumstances\r\n  of this case, the agreement should have been allowed into evidence to insure\r\n  that an equitable verdict was reached.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nWe find this case readily distinguishable from Poston.Â \r\n  Todd and Joyner were both insured by State Farm.Â  Todd entered into a covenant\r\n  not to execute whereby she agreed not to execute against Joynerâ€™s personal\r\n  assets and to take her recovery from Joynerâ€™s $25,000 liability policy, which\r\n  was tendered, and Toddâ€™s own underinsured coverage.Â  So, at trial, Todd was\r\n  essentially proceeding against her own insurance company.Â  Since naming the\r\n  insurer is impermissible in this type of action, Joyner was the sole remaining\r\n  party who could serve as the named defendant.Â  The primary circumstance that\r\n  compelled the admission of the covenant into evidence in Poston, i.e.,\r\n  the possibility of jury confusion due to multiple parties defendant, is simply\r\n  not present here.\r\nToddâ€™s\r\n  position is based in part upon her contention that during the opening\r\n  statement, Joynerâ€™s counsel alluded to Joynerâ€™s responsibility to pay the\r\n  entire amount of the damages award.Â  We find this contention is misplaced and\r\n  taken out of context, as the crux of Joynerâ€™s opening statement did not focus\r\n  on Joynerâ€™s personal responsibility for the damages.Â  Rather, Joyner questioned\r\n  the reasonableness of the medical costs Todd claimed were necessitated by the\r\n  automobile accident.Â  Because we find no evidence of an abuse of discretion\r\n  amounting to an error in law in the record, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  decision to exclude the covenant.\r\nIII.&nbsp; New\r\n  Trial Nisi Additur\r\nTodd next asserts the circuit court erred in not\r\n  granting additur to the juryâ€™s damages award, which only reimbursed Todd\r\n  for her medical expenses.Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial court may grant a new trial nisi additur whenever it finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate.Â  Green\r\n  v. Fritz, 356 S.C. 566, 570, 590 S.E.2d 39, 41&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â \r\n  â€œWhile the granting of such a motion rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court, substantial deference must be afforded to the juryâ€™s determination\r\n  of damages.â€Â  Id.Â  To this end, the trial court must offer compelling\r\n  reasons for invading the juryâ€™s province by granting a motion for additur.Â  Id.Â  An appellate court will only reverse if the trial court abused its discretion\r\n  in deciding a motion for new trial nisi additur to the\r\n  extent that an error of law results.Â  Id.Â  The denial of a motion for a\r\n  new trial nisi additur is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Oâ€™Neal v.\r\n    Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993).Â  â€œThe consideration\r\n  of a motion for a new trial nisi additur requires the court to\r\n  consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of the evidence presented.â€Â  Waring v. Johnson,\r\n  341 S.C. 248, 257, 533 S.E.2d 906, 911 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A trial court does not\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying a\r\n  motion for new trial nisi additur where\r\n  evidence in the record supports the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  See Steele&nbsp;v.\r\n    Dillard, 327 S.C. 340, 345, 486 S.E.2d 278, 281 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (finding no abuse of discretion where the evidence in the record supports the\r\n  amount of the jury award even though other evidence in the record indicated the\r\n  jury could have awarded a larger verdict).\r\nThe jury awarded Todd $37,191.11, her exact medical\r\n  costs.Â  In the jury instructions, the circuit court provided the jury with a\r\n  thorough explanation of how it could determine a monetary value for the damages\r\n  to which it believed Todd was entitled.Â  This included a full explanation of\r\n  actual damages, including:Â  â€œpast and future medical charges related to the\r\n  injury, pharmacy charges, related expenses, pain and suffering, loss of\r\n  enjoyment of life, as well as mental anguish and impairment of health or\r\n  physical condition.â€Â  We find evidence in the record to support the juryâ€™s\r\n  verdict.Â  Joyner argued that all of Toddâ€™s claimed damages were not proximately\r\n  caused by the accident and that all of the medical treatment was not reasonably\r\n  necessary.Â  Joyner cited the relatively low impact of the collision along with\r\n  Toddâ€™s apparently limited injury immediately following the accident in support\r\n  of her position.Â  Because there was evidence in the record to support the\r\n  juryâ€™s verdict, we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Toddâ€™s motion\r\n  for new trial nisi additur.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Expertâ€™s Reliance on Medical Records During\r\n  Deposition\r\nFinally, Todd contends the circuit court erred in\r\n  allowing an expert to read medical records to the jury during his testimony.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe admission or rejection of testimony is largely\r\n  within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion, the exercise of which will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Pike v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000).Â  Evidence is\r\n  relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence.Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Relevant evidence may\r\n  be excluded, however, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nExperts may testify regarding facts or data, not as\r\n  substantive proof of the facts so stated, but rather as information upon which\r\n  they have relied in reaching their professional opinions.Â  Gentry v.\r\n    Watkins-Carolina Trucking Co., 249 S.C. 316, 324, 154 S.E.2d 112, 117\r\n  (1967).Â  Rule 703, of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an\r\n  expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to\r\n  the expert at or before the hearing.Â  If of a type reasonably relied upon by\r\n  experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the\r\n  subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.Â  \r\n\r\nEven if an expertâ€™s testimony is admissible under Rule\r\n  703, the determination of whether an expert may testify to the facts underlying\r\n  an opinion must be analyzed under Rule 403. Â State v. Slocumb, 336 S.C.\r\n  619, 627, 521 S.E.2d 507, 511 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Because any evidence of Toddâ€™s\r\n  medical history would have a minuscule prejudicial effect, if any, as opposed\r\n  to the high probative value it lends as the basis of Friedmanâ€™s opinion, we\r\n  agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination. Â \r\nFinding no error of law, we conclude the circuit court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in allowing Friedman to opine as to the evidence\r\n  contained within Toddâ€™s medical records.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  Based on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court did not err in\r\n  failing to: Â (1) allow evidence to prove the bias of Joynerâ€™s expert; (2) admit the covenant not to execute between Todd\r\n  and State Farm; and (3) grant Toddâ€™s new\r\n  trial nisi additur motion.Â  Further, the circuit court did not\r\n  err in allowing Joynerâ€™s expert to testify as to the contents of Toddâ€™s medical\r\n  records.Â  The decision of the circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Although the terms liability and negligence\r\n  appear to have been used somewhat interchangeably during the trial, it is clear\r\n  that Joyner only stipulated to negligence as opposed to liability.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; This section addresses the arguments in\r\n  Toddâ€™s brief labeled Arguments I and III.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4316","title":"Lynch v.

Â Lynch argues the circuit court erred in requiring her to\r\n  elect a remedy.Â Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 1, 2003, Lynch brought her mother, Tatiana Kotova, to\r\n  a Â Babies â€œRâ€ Us store in North Charleston.Â  Kotova, a Russian National, was\r\n  vacationing in the United States and this was her first visit to the baby\r\n  superstore.Â  While shopping, Lynch decided to go to the restroom and handed some\r\n  baby cookies she had selected to Kotova, who put them in a black canvas tote\r\n  bag.  \r\nA customer witnessed Kotova placing the items in the bag and\r\n  reported the incident to a store employee. The employee went to the aisle and\r\n  saw Kotova position a box into her bag, move around some other items, pull out\r\n  what appeared to be a childâ€™s coat from the bag, and then push the coat down on\r\n  top of the items.Â  The employee called the store manager, Nrurka Galarraga, to\r\n  inform her that a customer saw â€œan older ladyâ€ putting merchandise inside a bag.[1]Â   \r\nThe manager contacted the North Charleston Police Department and\r\n  then approached Kotova. Â Noticing a piece of black garment covering some of the\r\n  merchandise in the tote bag, the manager asked Kotova if she could search it.Â  Although\r\n  Kotova did not speak English and could not understand the managerâ€™s request,\r\n  she permitted a search of the bag, wherein the manager discovered the boxes of cookies.Â \r\n \r\nLynch returned from the ladiesâ€™ restroom to find Kotova in this encounter\r\n  with the manager.Â  The manager asked Lynch about the cookies in the tote bag, and\r\n  Lynch responded that she and Kotova were â€œgoing to buy [them].â€Â  The manager\r\n  then provided Lynch and Kotova a shopping basket, in which Lynch placed the cookies,\r\n  and gave them permission to continue shopping.Â  Lynch and Kotova later arrived\r\n  at the checkout counter and purchased the cookies plus three additional items,\r\n  for a total of $10.10.  \r\nMeanwhile, officers from the North Charleston Police Department had\r\n  entered the store and were talking to the manager.Â  The officers approached\r\n  Lynch and Kotova as they were leaving the store, requested that they open their\r\n  bag, and asked the manager, â€œwhere can we talk?â€ The manager then escorted Lynch,\r\n  Kotova, and the officers into a nearby office for investigation.Â  In the\r\n  office, the manager told the officers that Lynch and Kotova had persisted in\r\n  their efforts to conceal merchandise, even after being provided with a shopping\r\n  basket.Â  At trial, however, the manager testified that after giving the women a\r\n  shopping basket they merely continued shopping and did nothing illegal or\r\n  suspicious.Â  Â The manager also told the officers that she had confronted Lynch\r\n  and Kotova twice for concealing items.Â  At trial, however, she recounted\r\n  only one confrontation.\r\nAfter the officers spoke with the parties, they gave the manager\r\n  three options: (1) to put Lynch and Kotova on trespass notice; (2) to sign an\r\n  affidavit and pursue a warrant for shoplifting; or (3) to press charges and effectuate\r\n  an immediate arrest.Â  The manager elected the third option. Â The officers handcuffed\r\n  Lynch and Kotova, escorted them through the busy store to the police car parked\r\n  in front of the store, and transported them to jail.Â   \r\nWhen the women arrived at the jail, they were patted down,\r\n  stripped of their belongings, and escorted to their cells.Â  Lynch and Kotova\r\n  spent ten hours in jail before being transported in handcuffs and shackles to a\r\n  bond hearing.Â  Two hours after the bond hearing, they were released.Â  Lynch\r\n  claimed she and Kotova could not sleep that night, and the next morning, Lynch went\r\n  to church to seek comfort from her priest.Â  Lynch also testified to\r\n  experiencing nightmares since the arrest.Â   \r\nLynch brought four causes of action\r\n  against Toys â€œRâ€ Us, alleging false imprisonment, malicious prosecution,\r\n  slander, and outrage.[2]Â \r\n  The case was tried before a jury, and at the close of the evidence, both Lynch\r\n  and Toys â€œRâ€ Us moved for directed verdicts.Â  The circuit court denied all of Toys\r\n  â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motions, but granted Lynchâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on false\r\n  imprisonment.Â  The circuit court submitted the remaining causes of action to\r\n  the jury.Â  The jury returned verdicts in favor of Lynch on all causes of action,\r\n  and awarded $50,000 in actual damages and $250,000 in punitive damages on each.\r\n \r\nToys\r\n  â€œRâ€ Us filed post-trial motions for JNOV, new trial pursuant to the thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine, new trial absolute, new trial nisi remittitur,\r\n  and new trial based on juror misconduct.Â  The circuit court denied these\r\n  motions.Â  However, the circuit court required Lynch to elect one of the four\r\n  awards as the basis for her recovery.Â  Lynch elected to recover based on her\r\n  malicious prosecution cause of action, and thus received $50,000 in actual\r\n  damages and $250,000 in punitive damages for a combined total of $300,000.Â  These\r\n  cross-appeals followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s\r\n  Appeal\r\nA.&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict on False Imprisonment\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us contends the circuit court erred by granting a\r\n  directed verdict to Lynch on her false imprisonment cause of action and by\r\n  denying Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the same issue.Â  We believe\r\n  the issue of false imprisonment was for the jury to decide.\r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict motion, the circuit court is\r\n  required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn\r\n  therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C.\r\n    State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The appellate\r\n  court must follow the same standard.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons,\r\n    Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).Â  â€œIf more than one\r\n  reasonable inference can be drawn or if the inferences to be drawn from the\r\n  evidence are in doubt, the case should be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Chaney v.\r\n    Burgess, 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1965).Â   \r\nThe essence of the tort of false imprisonment consists of\r\n  depriving a person of his or her liberty without lawful justification.Â  Law\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 440, 629 S.E.2d 642, 651 (2006).Â  To\r\n  establish false imprisonment under South Carolina law, the plaintiff must show\r\n  that the defendant restrained the plaintiff; the restraint was intentional; and\r\n  the restraint was unlawful.Â  Id.; see also Gist v. Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 336 S.C. 611, 618, 521 S.E.2d 163, 167 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).Â   \r\nToys\r\n  â€œRâ€ Us raises the Merchantâ€™s Defense in regard to its actions.Â  Section\r\n  16-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (2003) protects merchants and their\r\n  employees who restrain or delay customers suspected of shoplifting if the\r\n  customer was delayed in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable time to permit\r\n  such investigation, and reasonable cause existed to believe that the customer\r\n  delayed had committed the crime of shoplifting.Â  As set out in the statute, â€œreasonable\r\n  causeâ€ is synonymous with â€œprobable cause.â€Â  S.C. Code Â§ 16-13-140 (2003).Â Â  Probable cause is defined as a good faith\r\n  belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this belief rests on such\r\n  grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious person, under the\r\n  circumstances, to believe likewise.Â  Jones v. City of Columbia, 301 S.C.\r\n  62, 65, 389 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1990).Â  The determination of whether probable\r\n  cause exists is ordinarily a jury question; however, it may be decided as a\r\n  matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion.Â  Law, 368\r\n  S.C. at 441, 629 S.E.2d at 651.\r\nLynch acknowledged at trial that the Merchantâ€™s Defense would\r\n  apply to the initial confrontation between the manager and her.Â  However, once\r\n  the manager investigated the situation and resolved it by providing the women\r\n  with a shopping basket and allowing them to continue to shop, Lynch argues the\r\n  store had no right to again detain her once the police arrived.Â  The circuit\r\n  court judge agreed and found as a matter of law that Lynch was falsely\r\n  imprisoned when she was restrained in the office.Â   \r\nAfter a thorough review of the record, we find there is evidence\r\n  from which the jury could have determined Toys â€œRâ€ Us continued to have\r\n  probable cause to detain Lynch even after the initial confrontation.Â  According\r\n  to the managerâ€™s testimony, Lynch and her mother continued to act â€œvery\r\n  nervousâ€ and went to different areas of the store â€œkind of hiding between\r\n  fixtures.â€Â  Â Â From this evidence, the\r\n  jury could have found probable cause existed to restrain the women once the\r\n  police arrived to determine whether additional merchandise had been concealed\r\n  after the initial confrontation. Â On the other hand, it was also in the juryâ€™s province to find that\r\n  Toys â€œRâ€ Us no longer had probable cause once the women were allowed to\r\n  continue shopping and ultimately paid for their merchandise.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  determination of whether Lynch was falsely imprisoned should have been\r\n  submitted to the jury.\r\nB.&nbsp; Directed Verdict/JNOV Motions on the Remaining\r\n  Causes of Action\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us next contends the\r\n  circuit court erred by denying its\r\n  directed verdict motions on the remaining causes of action or, alternatively, by\r\n  denying its motions for JNOV.Â  In ruling\r\n  on a motion for JNOV, as in ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the circuit court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can\r\n  be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the\r\n  motion.Â  McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006).Â  The motion should be denied when either the evidence\r\n  yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s denial of such motions can only be reversed when there is no evidence\r\n  to support the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; Malicious Prosecution\r\nAs\r\n  to its directed verdict and JNOV motions on the malicious prosecution cause of\r\n  action, Toys â€œRâ€ Us contends the circuit court should have found the store had\r\n  probable cause as a matter of law to prosecute Lynch. Â We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  order to recover in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must\r\n  show (1) the institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings,\r\n  either civil or criminal; (2) by, or at the instance of, the defendant; (3)\r\n  termination of such proceeding in the plaintiffâ€™s favor; (4) malice in\r\n  instituting such proceedings; (5) lack of probable cause; and (6) resulting\r\n  injury or damage.Â  Ruff v. Eckerds Drugs, Inc., 265 S.C. 563, 566, 220\r\n  S.E.2d 649, 651 (1975).Â  An action for malicious prosecution fails if the\r\n  plaintiff cannot prove each of the required elements by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence, including malice and lack of probable cause.Â  Law v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 435, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  \r\n \r\nProbable\r\n  cause, which is a defense to an action for malicious prosecution, has been\r\n  defined as â€œthe existence of such facts or circumstances as would excite the\r\n  belief of a reasonable mind, acting on facts within the knowledge of the\r\n  prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was\r\n  prosecuted.â€ Â Eckerds Drugs, 265 S.C. at 568, 220 S.E.2d at 652.Â  Thus,\r\n  for probable cause, the facts must be regarded from the point of view of the prosecuting\r\n  party; the question is not what the actual facts were, but what the prosecuting\r\n  party honestly believed them to be.Â  Law, 368 S.C. at 436, 629 S.E.2d at\r\n  649.Â  Although the question of whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a\r\n  jury question, in an action for malicious prosecution, it may be decided as a\r\n  matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, evidence was presented to support Lynchâ€™s claim that Toys â€œRâ€ Us\r\n  lacked probable cause to believe she had committed shoplifting, and malice may\r\n  be inferred from a lack of probable cause to institute the prosecution action. Id., 368 S.C. at 437, 629 S.E.2d at 649.Â  Further, there was evidence to show the\r\n  charge was pursued by Toys â€œRâ€ Us, it was terminated in Lynchâ€™s favor, and\r\n  Lynch suffered damages as a result.Â  Therefore, the circuit court properly\r\n  submitted the issue of malicious prosecution to the jury.\r\n2.&nbsp; Slander/Defamation\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us next contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV on\r\n  the slander cause of action.Â  Specifically, Toys â€œRâ€ Us argues the evidence\r\n  reflected a reasonable inference that Lynch intended to deprive the store of\r\n  merchandise; it was justified in calling the police; there was no testimony of\r\n  publication to a third party; and the report of Lynchâ€™s activities to the officers\r\n  was subject to a qualified privilege.Â  We disagree.  \r\nInitially, we note\r\n  that Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s assertion of a qualified privilege as a defense to\r\n  defamation is not preserved for our review. Â Because qualified privilege\r\n  was not raised to the circuit court, we refuse to consider it on appeal.Â  See, e.g., State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741\r\n  (2005) (holding that for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  elements of defamation include: (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning\r\n  another; (2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (3) fault on the\r\n  part of the publisher; and (4) either actionability of the statement\r\n  irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the\r\n  publication.Â  Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502,\r\n  518, 506 S.E.2d 497, 506 (1998).Â  Although slander is generally a spoken\r\n  defamation, the supreme court has established that a defamatory insinuation may\r\n  not only be made by word, but also by actions or conduct.Â  Tyler v.\r\n    Macks Stores of South Carolina, Inc., 275 S.C. 456, 458, 272 S.E.2d 633,\r\n  634 (1980).  \r\nHere, the record\r\n  indicates that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could have found\r\n  that Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s words and conduct were defamatory.Â  Evidence supports a\r\n  claim that: (1) the manager and employee distorted the facts of Lynchâ€™s actions\r\n  in telling the officers that Lynch and Kotova continued to steal items after\r\n  confronted; (2) as a result of these statements, and at the direction of the manager\r\n  and employee, the officers handcuffed Lynch and Mother and escorted them out of\r\n  the store; (3) the officers put Lynch and Kotova into the backseat of their marked\r\n  patrol car, which was parked in front of the store; and (4) Lynch suffered\r\n  damage to her reputation.[3]Â \r\n  Lynch testified that while handcuffed and walking out of the store, â€œeverybody\r\n  was looking at us.â€ Â In addition, this conduct occurred at a time in which Toys\r\n  â€œRâ€ Us admits the store was â€œvery busy.â€Â   \r\nBecause\r\n  a jury could have found that Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s statements concerning Lynchâ€™s\r\n  behavior and its insistence on an immediate handcuffed arrest was a\r\n  communication to both the officers and customers in the store that Lynch committed\r\n  shoplifting, a jury question existed as to whether Toys â€œRâ€ Us slandered Lynch.\r\n \r\n3.&nbsp; Outrage\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us\r\n  contends that the circuit court erred by finding, as a matter of law, that\r\n  outrage existed in this case.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nTo\r\n  establish an action for outrage, the plaintiff must show that: (1) the\r\n  defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or\r\n  was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his\r\n  or her conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme and atrocious as to exceed all\r\n  possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as outrageous and utterly intolerable\r\n  in civilized society; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff\r\n  was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Madden, 323 S.C. 63, 68, 448 S.E.2d 581, 584 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Initially,\r\n  the court determines whether the defendantâ€™s conduct may reasonably be regarded\r\n  as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery, and only if reasonable\r\n  persons might differ should the question be one for the jury.Â  Id.\r\nHere, evidence indicates\r\n  that Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s employees never specifically saw Lynch do anything illegal,\r\n  that Lynch and her mother were arrested after having paid for the merchandise, and\r\n  that the manager distorted the facts to the officers.Â  We find these facts fall\r\n  short of conduct â€œso atrocious that it exceeds all possible bounds of decency,â€\r\n  as contemplated by the outrage cause of action.Â  Cf. Shipman v. Glenn,\r\n  314 S.C. 327, 329, 443 S.E.2d 921, 922 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding that\r\n  supervisorâ€™s conduct in ridiculing speech of employee with cerebral palsy and\r\n  threatening to fire her was not sufficiently outrageous to support claim\r\n  of outrage).Â  Further, there is a lack of evidence indicating Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s\r\n  actions were outrageous to the extent they might be regarded as utterly\r\n  intolerable in a civilized society.Â  But cf. McSwain v. Shei,\r\n  304 S.C. 25, 29, 402 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1991) (holding that jury could find\r\n  outrageous and intolerable conduct of an employer who forced employee to\r\n  perform exercises in public which exposed her inability to control her\r\n  bladder).Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred in denying Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motions\r\n  for directed verdict and JNOV on the outrage cause of action.\r\nC.&nbsp; New\r\n  Trial Based on Juror Misconduct\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us contends the\r\n  circuit court erred by\r\n  denying its motion for a new trial absolute based on juror misconduct. Â Toys\r\n  â€œRâ€ Us specifically contends that because a member of the jury lacked complete\r\n  candor while responding under oath to voir dire and engaged in out-of-court\r\n  investigation, its motion for a new trial should have been granted. Â We disagree.\r\n1.&nbsp; Jurorâ€™s\r\n  Conduct During Voir Dire\r\nToys\r\n  â€œRâ€ Us contends that because a member of the jury did not reveal his alleged prior\r\n  false arrest to the circuit court during voir dire the juror\r\n  should have been disqualified from serving on the jury, and the court erred in\r\n  denying its motion for a new trial absolute based on this juror misconduct.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  granting of a new trial based on a jurorâ€™s failure to honestly respond to the\r\n  courtâ€™s voir dire remains within the sound discretion of the\r\n  circuit court.Â  Long v. Norris &amp; Assocs., Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 568,\r\n  538 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The appellate court will not reverse a\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision to deny a new trial absolute motion absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Id.Â  Further, when allegations arise concerning a jurorâ€™s\r\n  failure to reveal information in response to voir dire questions,\r\n  courts look to whether the concealment was intentional and consider the nature\r\n  of the information concealed.Â  State v. Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. 270, 274,\r\n  607 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A new trial is warranted if the court\r\n  finds that the juror intentionally concealed the information and the concealed\r\n  information would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a\r\n  material factor in the use of the partyâ€™s peremptory challenges.Â  Id.Â  However, a determination that a juror did not intentionally conceal the\r\n  information ends the courtâ€™s inquiry.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, as a policy matter, this court has refused to allow testimonies of\r\n  jurors to impeach verdicts.Â  Barsh v. Chrysler Corp., 262 S.C. 129, 134,\r\n  203 S.E.2d 107, 109 (1974).Â  Thus, upon an inquiry into the validity of a\r\n  verdict, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during\r\n  the course of the juryâ€™s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon any\r\n  other jurorâ€™s mind as influencing the juror to assent or dissent from the\r\n  verdict.Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 109, 610 S.E.2d 859, 867 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  A juror may only testify on the question of extraneous prejudicial\r\n  information was improperly brought to the juryâ€™s attention or whether any\r\n  outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nHere,\r\n  the circuit court directed a verdict in favor of Lynch on the false\r\n  imprisonment cause of action, and there is no evidence that the jurorâ€™s silence\r\n  regarding his alleged false arrest would have affected the juryâ€™s deliberation\r\n  on the remaining issues.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence the juror\r\n  intentionally concealed his history of false arrest or that the jurorâ€™s\r\n  revelation had any influence on the other jurorsâ€™ decisions.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s\r\n  motion for a new trial absolute based on juror misconduct.  \r\n2.&nbsp; Out-of-Court Investigation\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us also\r\n  contends that because the same member of the jury went to Lynchâ€™s place of\r\n  employment during a lunch break and thereafter reported to the remaining jurors\r\n  that â€œLynch must be trustworthy to work in a store that sells such expensive\r\n  items,â€ the jurorâ€™s out-of-court investigation was extrajudicial and\r\n  prejudicial to the verdict.Â  We disagree.  \r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether any person has a coercive effect on a jury for any\r\n  reason is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Parker\r\n    v. Evening Post Pub. Co., 317 S.C. 236, 247, 452 S.E.2d 640, 647 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The test is whether there is reason to believe outside influences affected\r\n  the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Id.Â  In such a determination, the court will look\r\n  to relevant factors such as: (1) the number of jurors exposed; (2) the weight\r\n  of the evidence properly before the jury; and (3) the likelihood that curative\r\n  measures were effective in reducing the prejudice.Â  State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, 164, 539 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n \r\nTo\r\n  constitute reversible error, the casual viewing of a public place must have\r\n  been calculated to influence, and most likely must have influenced, the\r\n  verdict.Â  75B Am. Jur. 2d Trial Â§ 1550 (2006).Â  However,\r\n  even purposeful, unauthorized views of the premises made by a juror, in which\r\n  the juror did nothing more than look at or examine the premises, is not\r\n  automatically prejudicial.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  Toys â€œRâ€ Us again relied on the juror affidavits, which suggested that during a\r\n  lunch break, one of the jurors visited Lynchâ€™s place of employment and reported\r\n  to the remaining jurors that based on the upscale nature of the establishment, Lynch\r\n  must be trustworthy.Â  There was no evidence that this influenced the verdict.Â  Moreover,\r\n  evidence had already been presented informing the jury that Lynchâ€™s place of\r\n  employment was an upscale retail establishment.Â  Thus, the jurorâ€™s visit to the\r\n  store did not provide the jury with any information that was not already before\r\n  it.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the circuit courtâ€™s denial\r\n  of Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motion for a\r\n  new trial absolute based on juror misconduct.Â   \r\nD.&nbsp; Thirteenth\r\n  Juror Doctrine\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us contends that because Lynch failed to prove the\r\n  elements necessary to recover under all four causes of actions for false\r\n  imprisonment, slander, malicious prosecution, and outrage, the juryâ€™s verdict\r\n  was not supported by evidence, and the circuit court erred by denying its\r\n  motion for a new trial absolute based on the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  We disagree. \r\n \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s thirteenth juror doctrine\r\n  allows the circuit court to grant a new trial absolute when the court finds the\r\n  evidence does not justify the verdict.Â  Trivelas v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  357 S.C. 545, 551, 593 S.E.2d 504, 507 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The appellate court\r\n  will not disturb a circuit courtâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon\r\n  the facts unless its decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the\r\n  conclusion reached was controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â   \r\nAs explained previously, we find sufficient evidence existed\r\n  to support submission of the false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and\r\n  slander causes of action to the jury.Â  We have also addressed the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s failure to direct a verdict on outrage above.Â  Thus, we find the\r\n  circuit court did not err in denying Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motion for a new trial\r\n  absolute based on the thirteenth juror doctrine.  \r\nE.&nbsp; New\r\n  Trial and Juryâ€™s Excessive Award\r\nToys â€œRâ€ Us argues the circuit court erred by denying its motions\r\n  for a new trial absolute or nisi remittitur based on the juryâ€™s\r\n  excessive award of $50,000 in actual damages and $250,000 in punitive damages\r\n  for each cause of action.Â  Toys â€œRâ€ Us specifically contends that because there\r\n  was no testimony of Lynchâ€™s actual damages, and the reasonable conduct of its\r\n  employees preclude any award of punitive damages, it was error for the court to\r\n  deny its motions for a new trial absolute or nisi remittitur.Â  We\r\n  disagree.  \r\nThe\r\n  grant or denial of a new trial motion rests within the discretion of the circuit\r\n  court, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless its findings are\r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by\r\n  an error of law.Â  Proctor v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 368\r\n  S.C. 279, 320, 628 S.E.2d 496, 518 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The circuit court alone\r\n  has the power to grant a new trial nisi when it finds the amount of the\r\n  verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Id.Â  If the amount of the\r\n  verdict is grossly excessive or inadequate so as to be the result of passion,\r\n  caprice, prejudice, or some other influence outside of the evidence, the\r\n  circuit court must grant a new trial absolute.Â  Id.Â  When the denial of\r\n  a motion for a new trial nisi is appealed, this court will reverse when\r\n  the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive, requiring the granting of a new\r\n  trial absolute.Â  However, compelling reasons must be given to justify invading\r\n  the juryâ€™s province by granting a new trial. Â Id. at 320, 628 S.E.2d at\r\n  518. Â \r\nHere,\r\n  evidence demonstrates Lynch suffered damages for each specific cause of action.Â \r\n  Lynch testified that she was arrested without justification; she was handcuffed\r\n  and escorted to a police car in full view of customers; and she was jailed for\r\n  ten hours, the combination of which also injured her reputation and led to her\r\n  humiliation, sleeplessness, and emotional pain.Â  We find this constitutes\r\n  evidence of actual damages.\r\nFurther, in South Carolina, â€œpunitive damages are allowed in\r\n  the interest of society in the nature of punishment and as a warning and\r\n  example to deter the wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses in the\r\n  future.â€Â  Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 396, 134 S.E.2d \r\n206, 210 (1964).&nbsp; They serve â€œas a vindication of private rights when it is \r\nproved that such have been wantonly, willfully or maliciously violated.â€ Harris v. Burnside,\r\n  261 S.C. 190, 196, 199 S.E.2d 65, 68 (1973).Â   \r\nEvidence\r\n  was presented to show that Toys â€œRâ€ Us wantonly, willfully, and maliciously fabricated\r\n  and distorted the facts of Lynchâ€™s actions to the officers and rejected the officersâ€™\r\n  alternatives to the immediate arrest of Lynch and her mother, all without ever\r\n  observing any illegal action by Lynch.Â  Such evidence was sufficient for the jury\r\n  to award punitive damages.[4]\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, and because Toys â€œRâ€ Us has not provided any compelling\r\n  reasons to justify invading the juryâ€™s province by granting a new trial, we\r\n  find the circuit court did not err in denying its motions for a new trial absolute or nisi remittitur based on the juryâ€™s award of damages.\r\nII.&nbsp; Lynchâ€™s Appeal: Election\r\n  of Remedies \r\nLynch\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in requiring her to elect one of four causes\r\n  of action for which the jury awarded damages, when those causes of action were\r\n  based on different facts.Â  Because we have found the false imprisonment cause\r\n  of action should have gone to the jury and the circuit court should have\r\n  directed a verdict in favor of Toys â€œRâ€ Us on the outrage cause of action, we\r\n  need only decide whether Lynch should have had to elect between the remaining\r\n  malicious prosecution and slander verdicts.Â  We hold that she should not.\r\nThe\r\n  doctrine of election of remedies requires a plaintiff to choose between different\r\n  remedies allowed by law upon the same set of facts.Â  Jones v. Winn Dixie,\r\n  318 S.C. 171, 175, 456 S.E.2d 429, 431 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Within this context,\r\n  the facts refer to the defendantâ€™s wrongs or actions, so that when a plaintiff\r\n  asserts only one primary wrong committed by the defendant, the plaintiff is\r\n  entitled to only one recovery under the doctrine. Â Id.Â  Therefore, the doctrine\r\n  has no application when two separate causes of action exist based on different facts.Â  Id.Â  Application of the doctrine should be confined to cases in which\r\n  double compensation to the plaintiff is threatened.Â  Tomlinson, 367 S.C.\r\n  at 470-471, 626 S.E.2d at 44-45.  \r\nIn Jones\r\n  v. Winn-Dixie, 318 S.C. 171, 456 S.E.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1995), this court\r\n  reversed the trial judgeâ€™s reformation of the juryâ€™s verdict to require an\r\n  election of remedies between a false imprisonment verdict and assault and\r\n  battery verdict.Â  In Winn-Dixie, Jones was suspected by a store manager\r\n  of stealing shoe inserts from the store.Â  Id. at 173, 456 S.E.2d at 431.Â \r\n  The jury returned identical verdicts for each cause of action, including\r\n  $25,000 in actual damages and $50,000 in punitive damages for each.Â  In finding\r\n  election improperly applied, this court reasoned that the plaintiffâ€™s action\r\n  for false imprisonment was not based upon the same elements as his action for\r\n  assault and battery, and that the plaintiffâ€™s injuries occurred at different\r\n  times and resulted from separate and distinct actions on Winn-Dixieâ€™s part.Â  Id.\r\nAs in Winn-Dixie,\r\n  Lynchâ€™s causes of action were based upon different elements.Â  The essence of a\r\n  claim for malicious prosecution is the lawful prosecution of an unwarranted\r\n  criminal or civil proceeding against the plaintiff for malicious reasons,\r\n  whereas slander consists of a false, defamatory statement communicated to a\r\n  third party which results in injury to reputation.Â  See, e.g., Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 440, 629 S.E.2d 642, 651\r\n  (2006); Williams v. Lancaster Co.\r\n    School Dist., 369 S.C. 293, 302, 631 S.E.2d 286, 291-92 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nAlso,\r\n  Lynch suffered distinct injuries specific to each alleged wrong committed by\r\n  Toys â€œRâ€ Us.Â  Lynch spent ten hours in jail, needed to hire an attorney, and\r\n  suffered nightmares as a result of the malicious prosecution.Â  Lynch suffered\r\n  injury to her reputation as a result of the slander.Â  The malicious\r\n  prosecution injury began when Lynch was arrested at the insistence of Toys â€œRâ€\r\n  Us, and the slander occurred when Lynch was escorted, while handcuffed, out of\r\n  the store and into the police car in full view of the public. Thus, the\r\n  circuit court erred by requiring Lynch to elect between her remedies for\r\n  malicious prosecution and slander.Â   \r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court erred by granting a directed verdict to\r\n  Lynch on the false imprisonment cause of action.Â  The circuit court did not err by denying Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motions for\r\n  directed verdict and JNOV on the malicious prosecution and slander causes of\r\n  action.Â  Nor do we find the court erred in refusing to grant a new trial.Â  However,\r\n  the circuit court erred by denying Toys â€œRâ€ Usâ€™s motion for directed verdict\r\n  and JNOV on the outrage cause of action and in requiring Lynch to elect a\r\n  remedy.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nGOOLSBY and\r\n  STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The manager testified that the customer described the\r\n  suspect as â€œan older lady;â€ however, the employee testified the customer\r\n  reported that â€œsome ladiesâ€ were putting merchandise in a bag.\r\n[2] Kotova returned to Russia after this incident and was\r\n  not a party to this action.\r\n[3] Slander involving the accusation that the plaintiff\r\n  committed a crime of moral turpitude is actionable per se, which\r\n  carries a presumption of general damages.Â  Holtzscheiter v.

Kelly Jackson,Â  of Sumter, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In this criminal case, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s holding that an inmate was\r\n  not entitled to be advised of his Miranda[1] rights when he spoke to a television reporter.  \r\nFACTS\r\nPrisoners rioted at the Lee Correctional Institution located in Bishopville,  South Carolina.Â  Correctional Officers Marcus Cotton (Cotton) and Kenneth\r\n  Dozier (Dozier) were working in the Chesterfield Housing Unit at the time of\r\n  the riot.Â  Prior to the incident, Cotton was providing meals to inmates located\r\n  in the south side of the Chesterfield Unit, while Dozier provided meals to\r\n  inmates located in the north side of the Chesterfield Unit.Â Â Â   \r\nCotton opened inmate Jacob Lynchâ€™s (Lynch) cell door to furnish Lynch\r\n  a meal.Â  While the door of his cell was open, Lynch escaped.Â  Cotton ordered\r\n  Lynch to return to his cell, but Lynch refused.Â  Rather than attempting to\r\n  force Lynch back into his cell, Cotton continued with the feeding duties.[2]Â  Cotton then opened inmate Tyrone\r\n  Singletaryâ€™s (Singletary) cell to provide him with a meal.Â  Singletary\r\n  absconded from his cell and refused to return.Â   \r\nLynch and Singletary released other prisoners in the Chesterfield\r\n  Unit and took Cotton hostage.Â  Cotton testified that during the struggle to\r\n  capture him, Lynch and Singletary stabbed him with a shank.[3]Â   \r\nShortly after Cottonâ€™s capture, Dozier, who was delivering meals\r\n  to the inmates on the north side, noticed Lynch and Singletary.Â  Lynch and\r\n  Singletary attempted to capture Dozier, but Dozier managed to barricade himself\r\n  in a room.Â  Lynch and Singletary sought to seize Dozier by breaking the door.Â \r\n  Lynch and Singletary threatened to kill Dozier and tried to stab Dozier.Â  However,\r\n  neither apprehended Dozier.Â   \r\nCotton described Lynch as the leader of the riot.Â  During the\r\n  subsequent hours of negotiations with law enforcement, Lynch controlled\r\n  Cotton.Â Â  During the confrontation with law enforcement officials, Lynch would\r\n  repeatedly come to the door of the Chesterfield Unit with Cotton handcuffed to\r\n  him and demand access to the media.Â  Lynch and Singletary threatened to kill\r\n  Cotton and Dozier if their demands were not met.Â   \r\nCraig Melvin[4] (Melvin), along with other members of the media, covered the riot at Lee\r\n  Correctional Institution.Â  The media requested an interview with the head of\r\n  the Corrections Department, John Ozmint (Ozmint).Â  In response, Ozmint obtained\r\n  the names and cell phone numbers of the members of the media who were present\r\n  at the riot.Â  Ozmint called Melvin, and as a result of that call, Melvin entered\r\n  the prison.Â   \r\nShortly before being interviewed by Melvin, Lynch released Cotton\r\n  and surrendered.Â  Lynch was charged with two counts of taking a hostage,\r\n  rioting, assaulting a correctional officer, carrying a weapon by an inmate, and\r\n  inciting a riot.Â  The jury convicted Lynch on each count.Â  Consequently, Lynch\r\n  was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the hostage counts,\r\n  ten years for rioting, five years for assaulting a correctional officer, ten\r\n  years for carrying a weapon by an inmate, and ten years for inciting a riot.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court reviews errors of law only.Â  State\r\n  v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  An appellate court\r\n  is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Banda, 371 S.C. 245, 251, 639 S.E.2d 36, 39\r\n  (2006).Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s determination of whether a defendant was\r\n  deprived of his Miranda rights will be upheld unless unsupported by the\r\n  record.Â  State v. Navy, 370 S.C. 398, 405, 635 S.E.2d 549, 553 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (â€œAppellate review of whether a\r\n  person is in custody for Miranda purposes is limited to a determination of whether the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by the record.â€);Â  see State v.\r\n    Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 342, 471 S.E.2d 745, 751 (Ct. App. 1996) (Appellate review on issue of whether defendant was in\r\n  custody triggering Miranda warnings is limited to determination of\r\n  whether the ruling by the trial court is supported by testimony.).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLynch puts forth two arguments on appeal.Â  Shortly after Lynch\r\n  released Cotton, Melvin interviewed Lynch.Â  During this interview, Lynch made\r\n  several incriminating statements.Â  Lynch asked the trial court to suppress\r\n  these statements, arguing Melvin became an agent of the State at the time of\r\n  the interview.Â  Lynch contended statements made to Melvin were obtained through\r\n  custodial interrogation initiated by law enforcement officials without Miranda warnings.Â  The trial court denied this motion.Â  \r\n \r\nLynch also objected to the introduction of videos obtained by the\r\n  Department of Corrections.Â  The videos were taken during and subsequent to the\r\n  riot.Â  They show, among other things, the negotiations between the inmates and\r\n  law enforcement officials and the condition of the Chesterfield Unit after the\r\n  riot.Â  Lynch argued the videos would inflame the passion of the jury and their\r\n  prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value.Â  The trial court overruled\r\n  this objection.Â  We address each argument in turn.  \r\nA. The trial\r\n  court correctly held that Miranda warnings were not required.\r\nThe\r\n  Fifth Amendment provides, â€œNo person shall be . . . compelled in any criminal\r\n  case to be a witness against himself . . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. V.Â  Based on the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s protection\r\n  against self-incrimination, the United States Supreme Court announced, â€œ[T]he prosecution may not use statements,\r\n  whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of\r\n  the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards . . . .â€Â  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444.Â  Miranda rights[5] attach only if the suspect is subject to custodial\r\n  interrogation.Â  State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 303, 479 S.E.2d 838, 842\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â   \r\nCustodial\r\n  interrogation is â€œquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a\r\n  person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of\r\n  action in any significant way.â€Â  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444.Â \r\n  Specifically, interrogation is either express questioning or its functional\r\n  equivalent.Â  Kennedy, 325 S.C. at 303, 479 S.E.2d at 842. Â The\r\n  functional equivalent of an interrogation includes words or action on the part\r\n  of the police, other than those that normally follow an arrest or custody, that\r\n  the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating\r\n  response from the suspect.Â  State v. Binney, 362 S.C. 353, 359, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 418, 421 (2005).\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, Lynch was not subject to custodial interrogation when he spoke with\r\n  Melvin.Â  Law enforcement officials at the site of the riot did not question\r\n  Lynch.Â  Rather Lynch demanded, as a condition to release Cotton and as a condition\r\n  of surrender, access to the media.Â  Melvin was provided to accommodate Lynchâ€™s\r\n  demands.Â  During the interview, Melvin was acting as a private citizen, namely\r\n  a reporter, and not as an agent of the State.Â  Melvinâ€™s testimony supports this\r\n  conclusion.  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\t[A]s your duties as a news reporter,\r\n  anchor, did you have an opportunity to come to Lee County . . . to cover a\r\n  story at the Lee Correctional Institute?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tWhat was that story?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. . . \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI was told . . . that there were some\r\n  inmates who had taken some guards hostage and that they were requesting [a] member\r\n  of the media to speak with.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd you became that member of the\r\n  media?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t. . . \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\t[W]hen the situation ended, when the\r\n  crisis was over, did you interview a specific inmate named Jacob Lynch?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tYes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd how did that occur?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tAt the . . . end of this . . .\r\n  situation . . . they brought Mr. Lynch over and I proceeded to . . . ask him\r\n  some questions.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tAnd you asked him about the . . .\r\n  situation that took place inside [the Chesterfield Unit]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI believe I asked him about that, you\r\n  know, what happened in there and also asked him generally speaking, you know,\r\n  his grievances.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nMelvinâ€™s testimony\r\n  demonstrates he was at Lee Correctional Instuttion covering the riot as a news\r\n  reporter and not as an agent of the police.Â  Thus, Lynchâ€™s statements to Melvin\r\n  were not the result of a custodial interrogation.Â   \r\nEven if we assumed\r\n  Melvin acted as an agent of the State at the time he interviewed Lynch, the Miranda warnings would be inapplicable.Â  The Miranda decision is meant to\r\n  preserve the privilege against self-incrimination during interrogation of a\r\n  suspect in a police dominated atmosphere.Â  Illinois v. Perkins,\r\n  496 U.S. 292, 296 (1990).Â Â  The police dominated atmosphere generates\r\n  â€œinherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individualâ€™s will\r\n  to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so\r\n  freely.â€Â  Id. (internal quotations omitted). Â Â When an individual speaks\r\n  to an undercover law enforcement official, Miranda warnings are not\r\n  required.Â  Id.\r\nAssuming Melvin\r\n  acted as an agent of the police, Lynch would not have known this.Â  (â€œCoercion\r\n  is determined from the perspective of the suspect.â€).Â  Id.Â  Rather,\r\n  Lynch would have perceived Melvin as a reporter covering the prison riot.Â  During\r\n  Lynchâ€™s interview, Melvinâ€™s questions were of the same nature that any\r\n  reasonable reporter covering a riot would ask.Â  For example, Melvin asked Lynch\r\n  what occurred inside the Chesterfield Unit, why the riot occurred, and what\r\n  Lynchâ€™s grievances were.Â  If Melvin was operating as a government agent during\r\n  the interview, he was doing so in an undercover capacity, thus making the Miranda warnings inapplicable.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nIf we assumed Melvin\r\n  acted as an agent of the State and Lynch was aware of this, the trial court did\r\n  not err in refusing to suppress Lynchâ€™s statements.Â  The failure to suppress\r\n  evidence for possible Miranda violations is harmless if the record\r\n  contains sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State\r\n    v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 129, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1997).Â  The record\r\n  contains the testimony of numerous eyewitnesses that prove Lynchâ€™s guilt beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt.  \r\nAccording to Cottonâ€™s\r\n  testimony, Lynch stabbed and threatened to kill Cotton on at least three\r\n  separate occasions.Â  Cotton described Lynch as the leader of the riot.Â  Although\r\n  Cottonâ€™s testimony may be deemed as bias, other evidence supports Cottonâ€™s\r\n  version.\r\nNumerous correctional\r\n  officers testified Lynch stabbed and threatened to kill Cotton. Â Sergeant Wanda\r\n  Scarborough testified Lynch told her Cotton was being held as a hostage.Â  Lieutenant\r\n  Robert Johnson testified Lynch threatened to kill Cotton with a homemade\r\n  shank.Â  Sergeant Cedrick June testified he observed Lynch with a shank,\r\n  witnessed Cotton handcuffed to Lynch, and saw Lynch stab Cotton in the shoulder\r\n  twice.Â  Captain Arenda Thomas saw Cotton handcuffed to Lynch and witnessed Lynch\r\n  stab Cotton.Â  Dozier testified Lynch threatened to kill Cotton.Â  Officer Yvonne\r\n  Blandshaw testified she observed Cotton handcuffed to Lynch and saw Lynch stab\r\n  Cotton twice.Â  Officer Cynthia York testified she saw Lynch stab Cotton twice.Â \r\n  Major John Ferraro, an expert in hostage negotiation, testified Lynch slapped,\r\n  punched, and stabbed Cotton.Â  Major Ferraro also testified Lynch threatened to\r\n  kill Cotton.Â  The overwhelming evidence of Lynchâ€™s guilt renders any possible Miranda violation harmless.\r\nB. The trial court did not\r\n  error by admitting the video tapes.\r\nAs noted above, Lynch objected to the introduction of\r\n  videos obtained by the Department of Corrections.Â  These videos were taken\r\n  during and subsequent to the riot.Â  They depict the state of the Chesterfield\r\n  Unit after the riot, the negotiations between the inmates and law enforcement\r\n  officials, and the condition of Lynchâ€™s cell.Â   \r\nDuring the hours of negotiations, Cotton was held in Lynchâ€™s\r\n  cell.Â  The videos portray a bloody rag in Lynchâ€™s cell. Â Lynch argued the\r\n  videos would inflame the passion of the jury and their prejudicial effect out\r\n  weighed their probative value.Â  The trial court overruled this objection.Â  \r\n \r\nThe admission of evidence\r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. 527, 577, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007).Â  To constitute an abuse of\r\n  discretion, the conclusions of the trial judge must lack evidentiary support or\r\n  be controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â   \r\nEven\r\n  if the trial court improperly admitted the videos, we find any error in their admission\r\n  harmless because the videos were cumulative to other evidence which was\r\n  properly admitted.Â  State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 372-73, 453 S.E.2d\r\n  890, 891 (1995).Â  As explained above, numerous correctional officers testified\r\n  Lynch stabbed and threatened to kill Cotton.Â  Thus, the trial court did not\r\n  commit reversible error in admitting the videos.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[6]Â  \r\nSTILWELL\r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[2] Cottonâ€™s explanation for why he continued with his\r\n  duties instead of attempting to return Lynch to his cell is that correctional\r\n  officers are trained not to engage in a combative situation by themselves.Â  Rather,\r\n  officers are required to obtain assistance from other prison officers.Â   \r\n[3] A shank is a homemade knife, most often time used by\r\n  prisoners.Â   \r\n[4] Melvin is a reporter with the Columbia television station WIS.Â  \r\n \r\n[5] The well-known Miranda rights are that the accused must be informed of: the right to remain silent; any\r\n  statement made may be used as evidence against him or her; and the right to the\r\n  presence of an attorney.Â  State v.

Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSwafford\r\n  argues the trial court erred in excluding Gillespieâ€™s proffered evidence of\r\n  Gillespieâ€™s guilt.Â  We disagree.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina adopted the widely accepted rule regarding the admissibility of\r\n  third-party guilt evidence in State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d\r\n  532 (1941).Â  The rule states:\r\n\r\n\t[E]vidence offered by accused as to the commission of\r\n  the crime by another person must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent\r\n  with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or\r\n  presumption as to his own innocence; evidence which can have (no) other effect\r\n  than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference\r\n  as to the commission of the crime by another, is not admissible . . . [B]efore\r\n  such testimony can be received, there must be such proof of connection with it,\r\n  such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such\r\n  other person as the guilty party. \r\n\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d\r\n  at 534-35 (internal citations omitted).Â   \r\nIn State v. Gay[2]Â  and State v. Holmes,[3] the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court altered the rule in Gregory by considering the strength of the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s case in determining whether to admit evidence of third-party\r\n  guilt. See Holmes v. South Carolina, 126 S. Ct. 1727, 1733-34\r\n  (2006) (discussing these South Carolina cases).Â  The United States Supreme\r\n  Court vacated and remanded State v. Holmes and abrogated State v. Gay,\r\n  explaining that weighing the strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case is arbitrary\r\n  and does not rationally serve the end that the Gregory rule was designed\r\n  to promote.Â  Id. In comparison, the Gregory rule requires the\r\n  trial judge to consider the probative value or the potential adverse effects of\r\n  admitting proffered third-party guilt evidence.Â  Id.Â   \r\nThis trial was\r\n  conducted prior to the issuance of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Holmes.Â  Swafford argues the trial judge improperly excluded the\r\n  third-party guilt evidence and improperly relied on State v. Gay and State\r\n    v. Holmes.Â  Swafford also argues the trial court erred in excluding the\r\n  proffered testimony of hearsay statements made by Gillespie as they were\r\n  exceptions to hearsay.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge\r\n  mentioned State v. Gay and State v. Holmes while considering the\r\n  proffered testimony.Â  He properly concluded, however, that â€œall these started\r\n  with State v. Gregory . . . that imposed strict limitations on the\r\n  admissibility of third-party guilt.â€Â  The trial judge compared the facts of\r\n  this case to those in State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584\r\n  (1999).Â  In Cooper, the defendant attempted to introduce testimony of a\r\n  witness who allegedly overheard a third party telling a listener that she and\r\n  two others murdered the victim.Â  Cooper, 334 S.C. at 547, 514 S.E.2d at\r\n  588.Â  The alleged listener denied the statement.Â  Id.Â  The third party\r\n  also denied the statement.Â  Id.Â  Relying on Gregory, the supreme\r\n  court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of the evidence of third-party guilt.Â  Id. at 549-50, 514 S.E.2d at 589.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter a careful\r\n  review of the proffered testimony and the judgeâ€™s ruling, we find no\r\n  unconstitutional reliance on State v. Gay or State v. Holmes.Â \r\n  Johnsonâ€™s testimony that she witnessed Swafford in the truck as a passenger\r\n  several hours prior to the accident neither offers proof that he was a\r\n  passenger at the time of the accident nor that Gillespie was the driver at\r\n  either point in time.Â  At best, Johnsonâ€™s testimony raises the mere suspicion\r\n  that Gillespie may have been driving an hour prior to the accident, but offers\r\n  no reliable proof that he was driving at the time of the accident.Â  In like\r\n  vein, Townsendâ€™s alleged statements to Nealy were so inconsistent they raised\r\n  merely a bare suspicion of Gillespieâ€™s guilt.Â   \r\nFinally, we find no\r\n  error by the trial court in excluding Boboâ€™s testimony.Â  Bobo alleged Gillespie\r\n  confessed to involvement in a bad accident in a telephone conversation with\r\n  Bobo the night of this incident.Â  Bobo could produce no support for his bare\r\n  assertion that he telephoned Gillespie the night of the accident.Â  He claimed\r\n  he initiated the telephone call from the cellular telephone belonging to a\r\n  â€œgirl named Jade.â€Â  Bobo knew neither her last name nor her telephone\r\n  number.Â Â Â   \r\nThe trial judge in\r\n  this case considered Cooper, reiterated the rule in Gregory, and\r\n  considered the weakness of the proffered evidence rather than improperly\r\n  focusing on the strength of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  We recognize this is a close\r\n  case.Â  However, based on our limited standard of review, we find no reversible\r\n  error by the trial judge in excluding the proffered evidence.[4]Â Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, Swaffordâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] Contrary to the Stateâ€™s argument, we find the issue\r\n  preserved for appellate review.Â   \r\n[2] 343 S.C. 543, 541 S.E.2d 541 (2001), abrogated\r\n  by Holmes v.

Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor\r\n  Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  A jury found Anthony Woods (Woods) guilty of first-degree burglary\r\n  and two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Woods\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress hair, blood, and\r\n  saliva samples as the products of an unlawful search and seizure and requests a\r\n  new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 4, 2003, Woods broke into the Taylor residence at approximately 11 p.m.Â  Linda Taylor (Linda) testified that on the night\r\n  of the break-in, she was watching television in the den, which is near the back\r\n  door. Â Her mother, Elizabeth Taylor, was getting ready for bed in the bathroom.\r\n  Â Linda heard a noise outside, and when she looked through the blinds, she saw\r\n  the motion sensor lights turn on and noticed Woods standing outside facing her\r\n  through the window.Â  Linda testified Woods was â€œbathed in the flood lights,â€\r\n  and she could â€œsee him very well.â€Â   \r\nWoods punched his fist through the window pane of the door,\r\n  causing his hand and arm to bleed.Â  Although Linda attempted to block the door\r\n  with her body, Woods eventually pushed his way into the house and pushed Linda\r\n  onto a chair in the den.Â  Woods then hit Linda in the face.Â  Linda found her\r\n  mother lying on the floor after Woods escaped.Â  Thereafter, Linda noticed Woods\r\n  had stolen the keys to the house and car, pocketbooks, tote bags, and a Bible.Â  \r\n \r\nShortly after the incident, Officer Surette was dispatched to the Taylor residence.Â  As Officer Surette approached the house, he noticed a suspicious person walking\r\n  away from the Taylor residence. Â Although Officer Surette could not positively\r\n  identify Woods at that time, Woods was apprehended in the same area after State\r\n  Law Enforcement Division (SLED) brought in a bloodhound unit, which picked up Woodsâ€™\r\n  trail.Â  Woods was eventually captured that night and positively identified.Â \r\n  Police took Woods to the hospital where he was treated for arm and hand injuries.Â  \r\n \r\nOn June 6, 2003, SLED Officer Creech approached Judge Cooper in\r\n  chambers for a court order to obtain samples of Woodsâ€™ hair, saliva, and blood,\r\n  which Judge Cooper granted.Â  While Judge Cooper found probable cause existed to\r\n  issue the order, the State did not establish that Officer Creech submitted a\r\n  sworn affidavit or made a statement under oath to support the order.Â   \r\nDuring his trial, several police officers testified for the State,\r\n  and Linda identified Woods as the man who broke into her residence.Â  After the\r\n  trial, the jury convicted Woods of first-degree burglary and two counts of\r\n  aggravated assault and battery.Â  The trial court sentenced Woods to life\r\n  imprisonment for first-degree burglary and a concurrent ten years imprisonment\r\n  on each count of aggravated assault and battery.Â  Woods appeals.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, this Court reviews errors of law only.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Further, we are bound\r\n  by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id., 577 S.E.2d at 500-01.Â  Appellate review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure\r\n  cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  finding.Â  State v. Banda, 371 S.C. 245, 251, 639 S.E.2d 36, 39 (2006); see\r\n    also State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48-49, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006)\r\n  (â€œThe trial judgeâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed\r\n  due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed for clear error.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWoods argues the trial\r\n  court should have suppressed his hair, blood, and saliva samples as the products\r\n  of an unlawful search and seizure.Â  He contends state officers failed to follow\r\n  section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) in obtaining the court\r\n  order.Â  We agree.Â \r\n\r\nSection\r\n  17-13-140 provides:Â Â   \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  warrant issued hereunder shall be issued only upon affidavit sworn to before\r\n  the . . . judge of a court of record establishing the grounds for the warrant.Â \r\n  If the . . . judicial officer abovementioned is satisfied that the grounds for\r\n  the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they\r\n  exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or\r\n  describing the person or place to be searched.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  a court order issued pursuant to this section, which stands in place of a\r\n  search warrant, must be supported by a sworn oath or affirmation to be\r\n  admissible at trial.Â  Baccus, 367 S.C. at 54-55, 625 S.E.2d at 223 (â€œFollowing\r\n  these constitutional requirements, Â§ 17-13-140 requires a sworn affidavit for a\r\n  search warrant [or a court order] to be issued.â€ (citing U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10)).Â  Furthermore, the affidavit must set forth\r\n  particular facts and circumstances underlying the existence of probable cause\r\n  to allow the magistrate to make an independent evaluation of the matter.Â  Franks\r\n    v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 165 (1978).Â   \r\nOn\r\n  June 6, 2003, Officer Creech approached Judge Cooper in chambers for an order\r\n  to take samples of Woodsâ€™ hair, blood, and saliva.Â  Two other judges were\r\n  present in chambers when Officer Creech requested the order.Â  Although Judge\r\n  Cooper found probable cause to issue the order based on his conversation with\r\n  Officer Creech, there was no affidavit from Officer Creech to support the court\r\n  order, and Officer Creech failed to make a statement under oath as required by\r\n  section 17-13-140.Â  The State conceded the order was defective on its face.Â  We\r\n  find the court order failed to comply with statutory guidelines. Â Consequently,\r\n  the hair, blood, and saliva samples should have been suppressed.Â   \r\nDespite\r\n  this error, we affirm Woodsâ€™ conviction in light of the overwhelming evidence\r\n  of his guilt.Â  See, e.g., Baccus, 367 S.C. at 55, 625 S.E.2d at\r\n  223 (â€œWhen guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no\r\n  other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside a\r\n  conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting the result.â€).Â   \r\nHere,\r\n  the State presented evidence from several different sources.Â  Linda Taylor\r\n  identified Woods as the assailant and testified in detail about the incident.Â \r\n  Woodsâ€™ fingerprints were found inside the door where he gained entry into the Taylor residence, and his hand injuries were consistent with having broken the glass\r\n  window.Â  Officer Surette also testified he observed a suspicious person exiting\r\n  the driveway of the Taylor residence who fled into the same area that officers secured\r\n  after the break-in.Â  Bloodhounds then tracked Woods down within this secured\r\n  area.Â  Finally, the police found several items stolen from the Taylorâ€™s residence along the trail where officers tracked Woods.Â  Therefore, we find the hair,\r\n  blood, and saliva samples cumulative, and their admission is not grounds for\r\n  reversal of Woodsâ€™ conviction.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough the trial court erred in denying Woodsâ€™ motion to suppress pursuant\r\n  to section 17-13-140, such error was\r\n  harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence establishing his guilt.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL\r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
