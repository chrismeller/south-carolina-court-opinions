Mortensen (collectively referred to as â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal from \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s grant of motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \r\n  to W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., Charles C. Thompson, II, and Daniel Meyer \r\n  (collectively referred to as â€œRespondentsâ€).Â  Additionally, Appellants appeal \r\n  from the trial courtâ€™s grant of Respondent W.W. Nortonâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 (1977), the door closing statute.Â  We affirm as \r\n  to Thompson and Meyer.Â  We reverse and remand as to W.W. Norton.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the morning of April 19, 1989, the center 16â€ gun in Gun Turret \r\n  Two of the battleship USS IOWA exploded, killing 47 sailors.Â  As an event of \r\n  national concern, the explosion was made the subject of two CBS 60 Minutes \r\n  programs of which Respondent Thompson, a Virginia resident, was a producer.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, Respondent W.W. Norton, a New York publishing company, contracted \r\n  with Thompson to write a book explaining the events leading up to and following \r\n  the explosion aboard the battleship.Â  In preparing his manuscript, Thompson \r\n  interviewed over 200 individuals, one of whom was Respondent Meyer, a resident \r\n  of Maryland.Â  The ensuing book, A Glimpse of Hell, was first published \r\n  in March 1999 and distributed throughout the United States, including South \r\n  Carolina.\r\nIn March and April of 2001, Appellants filed suit against Respondents, asserting \r\n  causes of action for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. [1] Â  Specifically, Moosally, Miceli, \r\n  Morse, and Finney allege the book contains numerous falsities that suggest their \r\n  actions led to the deaths of the sailors aboard the battleship.Â  Mortensen avers \r\n  â€œthe book contains numerous falsehoods, inaccuracies and defamatory statements \r\n  that both libel and slander the Plaintiff.â€\r\nIn April of 2001, Respondents filed motions to dismiss pursuant to \r\n  Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP, for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  Additionally, Respondent \r\n  W.W. Norton moved to dismiss the complaints pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 \r\n  (1977), commonly known as South Carolinaâ€™s door closing statute.Â  Following \r\n  a hearing, the Circuit Court entered separate orders dismissing the claims against \r\n  all three Respondents.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is one which \r\n  must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case.Â  Engineered Prods. \r\n  v. Cleveland Crane &amp; Engâ€™g, 262 S.C. 1, 201 S.E.2d 921 (1974).Â  The \r\n  decision of the trial court should be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence \r\n  or influenced by an error of law.Â  Engineered Prods., 262 S.C. at 4, \r\n  201 S.E.2d at 922; see also Hammond v. Cummins Engine Co., 287 \r\n  S.C. 200, 336 S.E.2d 867 (1985) (stating that this Court is bound by Circuit \r\n  Courtâ€™s finding that nonresident defendant is subject to its jurisdiction absent \r\n  determination that Circuit Courtâ€™s ruling is without evidentiary support or \r\n  controlled by error of law); Industrial Equip. Co. v. Frank G. Hough Co., \r\n  218 S.C. 169, 173, 61 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1950) (â€œ[T]his Court has adhered to the \r\n  rule that a finding by the Circuit Court as to jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or \r\n  manifestly influenced or controlled by error of law.â€).\r\nIt is well-settled that the party seeking to invoke personal jurisdiction over \r\n  a non-resident defendant via our long-arm statute bears the burden of proving \r\n  the existence of personal jurisdiction.Â  Southern Plastics Co. v. Southern \r\n  Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992); Aviation Assocs. \r\n  &amp; Consultants, Inc. v. Jet Time, Inc., 303 S.C. 502, 402 S.E.2d 177 \r\n  (1991); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 274 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  At the pretrial stage, the burden of proving \r\n  personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a prima facie showing of \r\n  jurisdiction either in the complaint or in affidavits.Â  Mid-State Distribs., \r\n  Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 (1993); White \r\n  v. Stephens, 300 S.C. 241, 387 S.E.2d 260 (1990); International Mariculture \r\n  Res. v. Grant, 336 S.C. 434, 520 S.E.2d 160 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  JURISDICTION\r\nAppellants argue the Circuit Court erred in dismissing the claims against Meyer, \r\n  Thompson and W.W. Norton for lack of personal jurisdiction.\r\nThe determination of whether a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over \r\n  a nonresident defendant involves a two-step analysis.Â  Hammond v. Butler, \r\n  Means, Evins &amp; Brown, 300 S.C. 458, 388 S.E.2d 796 (1990); South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 551 S.E.2d 274 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  First, in order for the courts to have statutory authority \r\n  to exercise jurisdiction, the nonresident defendantâ€™s conduct must meet the \r\n  requirements of South Carolinaâ€™s long-arm statute.Â  White v. Stephens, \r\n  300 S.C. 241, 387 S.E.2d 260 (1990).Â  Second, the exercise of jurisdiction must \r\n  comport with the requirements of the due process clause.Â  Southern Plastics \r\n  Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992).Â  The \r\n  defendant must have sufficient contacts with South Carolina so that the constitutional \r\n  standards of due process are not violated.Â  White, 300 S.C. at 245, 387 \r\n  S.E.2d at 262; Basnight, 346 S.C. at 246, 551 S.E.2d at 277; International \r\n  Mariculture Res. v. Grant, 336 S.C. 434, 520 S.E.2d 160 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s long-arm statute provides:\r\n\r\n(1) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly \r\n  or by an agent as to a cause of action arising from the personâ€™s\r\n  \r\n(a) transacting any business in this State;\r\n(b) contracting to supply services or things in the State;\r\n(c) commission of a tortious act in whole or in part in this State;\r\n(d) causing tortious injury or death in this State by an act or omission outside \r\n  this State if he regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other \r\n  persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used \r\n  or consumed or services rendered, in this State; or\r\n(e) having an interest in, using, or possessing real property in this State; \r\n  or\r\n(f) contracting to insure any person, property or risk located within this State \r\n  at the time of contracting; or\r\n(g) entry into a contract to be performed in whole or in part by either party \r\n  in this State; or\r\n(h) production, manufacture, or distribution of goods with the reasonable expectation \r\n  that those goods are to be used or consumed in this State and are so used or \r\n  consumed.\r\n  \r\n(2) When jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon \r\n  this section, only a cause of action arising from acts enumerated in this section \r\n  may be asserted against him, and such action, if brought in this State, shall \r\n  not be subject to the provisions of Â§ 15-7-100 (3).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803 (2003).\r\nOur long-arm statute, which affords broad power to exercise personal jurisdiction \r\n  over causes of action arising from tortious injuries in South Carolina, has \r\n  been construed to extend to the outer limits of the due process clause.Â  Meyer \r\n  v. Paschal, 330 S.C. 175, 498 S.E.2d 635 (1998); Hammond v. Cummins Engine \r\n  Co., 287 S.C. 200, 336 S.E.2d 867 (1985); see also Cozi Investments \r\n  v. Schneider, 272 S.C. 354, 252 S.E.2d 116 (1979) (stating that South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  long-arm statute has been construed as a grant of jurisdiction as broad as constitutionally \r\n  permissible; hence, parameters of statute are restricted only by due process \r\n  limitations).Â  Because we treat our long-arm statute as coextensive with the \r\n  due process clause, the sole question becomes whether the exercise of personal \r\n  jurisdiction in this case would violate the strictures of due process.Â  See \r\n  Sonoco Products Co. v. Inteplast Corp., 867 F. Supp. 352, 354 (D.S.C. \r\n  1994) (â€œThe South Carolina long-arm statute . . . has been interpreted to reach \r\n  to the limits of due processâ€; â€œ[t]herefore, the determination of personal jurisdiction \r\n  in South Carolina compresses into a due process assessment of minimum contacts \r\n  and fair play.â€); Ryobi America Corp. v. Peters, 815 F. Supp. 172, 175 \r\n  (D.S.C. 1993) (â€œThe Long-Arm Statute in South Carolina is construed to extend \r\n  jurisdiction to the limits of Due Process.Â  Because the extent of the statute \r\n  and the relevant constitutional tests are the same, the inquiry for this court \r\n  is simply whether the exercise of jurisdiction over Jerry Peters violates his \r\n  right to Due Process.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the power of a state \r\n  court to exert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.Â  Asahi \r\n  Metal Ind. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987).Â  Due process requires \r\n  that there exist minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state \r\n  such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair \r\n  play and substantial justice.Â  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. \r\n  462 (1985); Aviation Assocs. &amp; Consultants, Inc. v. Jet Time, Inc., \r\n  303 S.C. 502, 402 S.E.2d 177 (1991); see also Quill Corp. v. North \r\n  Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 307 (1992) (â€œ[W]e have abandoned more formalistic \r\n  tests that focused on a defendantâ€™s â€˜presenceâ€™ within a State in favor of a \r\n  more flexible inquiry into whether a defendantâ€™s contacts with the forum made \r\n  it reasonable, in the context of our federal system of Government, to require \r\n  it to defend the suit in that State.â€); International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \r\n  326 U.S. 310 (1945) (noting due process clause requires that maintenance of \r\n  lawsuit against nonresident must not offend traditional notions of fair play \r\n  and substantial justice).Â  The due process requirement mandates the defendant \r\n  possess sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state, so that he could reasonably \r\n  anticipate being haled into court there.Â  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. \r\n  Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1980); Atlantic Soft Drink Co. v. South Carolina \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank, 287 S.C. 228, 336 S.E.2d 876 (1985).\r\nIn deciding whether a finding of minimum contacts comports with the due process \r\n  requirements of traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, the \r\n  court must consider: (1) the duration of the activity of the nonresident within \r\n  the state; (2) the character and circumstances of the commission of the nonresidentâ€™s \r\n  acts; (3) the inconvenience resulting to the parties by conferring or refusing \r\n  to confer jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the Stateâ€™s interest in \r\n  exercising jurisdiction.Â  Clark v. Key, 304 S.C. 497, 405 S.E.2d 599 \r\n  (1991); Colite Indus., Inc. v. G.W. Murphy Constr. Co., 297 S.C. 426, \r\n  377 S.E.2d 321 (1989); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, \r\n  346 S.C. 241, 551 S.E.2d 274 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  A single transaction is sufficient \r\n  to confer jurisdiction if these factors are met.Â  Colite Indus., 297 \r\n  S.C. at 429, 377 S.E.2d at 322; Hammond, 287 S.C. at 203, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  at 868-69; see also Askins v. Firedoor Corp., 281 S.C. 611, 616, \r\n  316 S.E.2d 713, 716 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œThe cases are legion that a single contact \r\n  with the forum state is sufficient to give its courts personal jurisdiction \r\n  over a nonresident if the contact gives rise to, or figures prominently in the \r\n  cause of action under consideration.â€).Â  Although a single act may support jurisdiction, \r\n  it must create a â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ with the forum.Â  Burger King Corp., \r\n  471 U.S. at 475 n.18; White v. Stephens, 300 S.C. 241, 247, 387 S.E.2d \r\n  260, 263 (1990).Â  A single act that causes harm in this State may create sufficient \r\n  minimum contacts where the harm arises out of or relates to that act.Â  Southern \r\n  Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992).Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe determination of whether the requirements of due process are satisfied \r\n  involves a two-prong analysis: (1) the â€œpowerâ€ prong, in which minimum contacts \r\n  provide courts the â€œpowerâ€ to adjudicate the action; and (2) the â€œfairnessâ€ \r\n  prong, which requires the exercise of jurisdiction to be â€œreasonableâ€ or â€œfair.â€Â  \r\n  Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 260, 423 S.E.2d at 131.Â  â€œIf either \r\n  prong fails, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the [nonresident] defendant \r\n  fails to comport with the requirements of due process.â€Â  Id.\r\nUnder the power prong, a minimum contacts analysis requires a court to find \r\n  that the defendant directed its activities to residents of South Carolina and \r\n  that the cause of action arises out of or relates to those activities.Â  Burger \r\n  King Corp., 471 U.S. at 472; Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 260, \r\n  423 S.E.2d at 131.Â  Without minimum contacts, the court does not have the â€œpowerâ€ \r\n  to adjudicate the action.Â  Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 260, 423 \r\n  S.E.2d at 131.Â  It is essential in each case that there be some act by which \r\n  the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities \r\n  within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.Â  \r\n  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235 (1958); Southern Plastics Co., \r\n  310 S.C. at 261, 423 S.E.2d at 131; see also Burger King Corp., \r\n  471 U.S. at 474 (stating the constitutional touchstone of determination whether \r\n  exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process is whether defendant \r\n  purposefully established minimum contacts in forum state).Â  The â€œpurposeful \r\n  availmentâ€ requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction \r\n  solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.Â  Burger \r\n  King Corp., 471 U.S. at 475; Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 262, \r\n  423 S.E.2d at 132.Â  Whether the constitutional requirement of minimum contacts \r\n  has been met depends on the facts of each case.Â  Burger King Corp., 471 \r\n  U.S. at 485-86; Security Credit Leasing, Inc. v. Armaly, 339 S.C. 533, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nUnder the fairness prong, we examine such factors as the burden on the defendant, \r\n  the extent of the plaintiffâ€™s interest, South Carolinaâ€™s interest, efficiency \r\n  of adjudication, and the several statesâ€™ interest in substantive social policies.Â  \r\n  See Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 263, 423 S.E.2d at 132.Â  \r\n  While choice of law analysis is separate and distinct from personal jurisdiction \r\n  analysis, which stateâ€™s law controls is a factor to be considered under the \r\n  fairness prong of due process.Â  Burger King Corp., 471 U.S. at 481-82.\r\nBecause the due process requirements must be met as to each defendant, we must \r\n  assess individually each defendantâ€™s contacts with South Carolina.Â  See \r\n  Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U.S. 320 (1980); Allen v. Columbia Fin. Mgmt., \r\n  Ltd., 297 S.C. 481, 377 S.E.2d 352 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nA.Â  Meyer\r\nInitially, we note Meyerâ€™s contacts with South Carolina appear to be limited \r\n  to this litigation.Â  Appellants aver that Meyer has satisfied the minimum contacts \r\n  requirement through assistance he gave to Thompson as one of the bookâ€™s sources \r\n  and through his work on the movie version of the book.Â  Notably, none of these \r\n  things were done within South Carolina.Â  One does not â€œpurposefully availâ€ himself \r\n  of this Stateâ€™s laws merely by providing information to an author about an event \r\n  that did not occur in South Carolina.Â  To hold otherwise would be to extend \r\n  jurisdiction over anyone interviewed by any publication about any event, no \r\n  matter where it occurred.Â  Indeed, such are the â€œrandomâ€ and â€œfortuitousâ€ contacts \r\n  the due process clause precludes from serving as the basis for jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  See Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 262, 423 S.E.2d at 132.\r\nBecause Meyerâ€™s contacts with this state are virtually nonexistent, the power \r\n  prong of the due process analysis is not satisfied.Â  Thus, the Circuit Court \r\n  correctly determined that it could not properly exercise jurisdiction over Meyer.Â  \r\n  See Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 261, 423 S.E.2d at 131 \r\n  (â€œIf either prong fails, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant \r\n  fails to comport with the requirements of due process.â€).\r\nB.Â  Thompson\r\nAppellants claim the minimum contacts requirement is met as to Thompson.Â  \r\n  We disagree with this assertion.\r\nAppellants essentially allege that the following activities by Thompson satisfy \r\n  the minimum contacts requirement: (1) Thompson was a producer on the television \r\n  show 60 Minutes, which airs in South Carolina; (2) he attended a funeral \r\n  in South Carolina in 1972 as a reporter for CBS; (3) copies of his book were \r\n  sold in South Carolina; (4) a movie version of his book was aired in South Carolina \r\n  on the FX network; and (5) he â€œmade at least one business call to South Carolina \r\n  for information on the IOWA.â€Â  Thompsonâ€™s personal contacts with South Carolina \r\n  consisted of one telephone call and attendance at a funeral in 1972.Â  Appellants \r\n  have cited no authority indicating that involvement with a nationally distributed \r\n  television program is sufficient to satisfy minimum contacts.Â  Moreover, an \r\n  individual does not â€œpurposefully availâ€ himself of the laws of this State merely \r\n  by virtue of having authored a single literary work on a topic of national interest.Â  \r\n  See Southern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 262, 423 S.E.2d at 132.\r\nBecause the subject matter of Thompsonâ€™s manuscript was an event of national \r\n  interest that occurred outside South Carolina, it does not follow that his activity \r\n  of pressing pen to paper was directed to the residents of South Carolina.Â  The \r\n  fruits of his laborâ€”be it in literary or in cinematic formâ€”arrived in South \r\n  Carolina not through his efforts, but through the efforts of others, and therefore \r\n  cannot serve as the basis for jurisdiction.Â  See Aviation Assocs. \r\n  &amp; Consultants, Inc. v. Jet Time, Inc., 303 S.C. 502, 507, 402 S.E.2d \r\n  177, 180 (1991) (â€œ[T]he focus must center on the contacts generated by the defendant, \r\n  and not on the unilateral actions of some other entity.â€); Allen v. Columbia \r\n  Fin. Mgmt., Ltd., 297 S.C. 481, 490, 377 S.E.2d 352, 377 (Ct. App. 1988) \r\n  (â€œDue Process requires us to examine each [defendantâ€™s] own contacts with South \r\n  Carolina. We decline to attribute the contacts of one alleged conspirator to \r\n  another alleged conspirator.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nThe â€œpowerâ€ prong of the due process analysis is not met as to Thompson.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the trial court correctly ruled that it lacked jurisdiction.\r\nC.Â  W.W. Norton\r\nAppellants contend the Circuit Court had personal jurisdiction over \r\n  W.W. Norton.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially, W.W. Norton admits that it is â€œâ€˜doing businessâ€™ in South \r\n  Carolina for purposes of the long-arm statute.â€\r\nIn analyzing the second step necessary to exercise personal jurisdiction over \r\n  a nonresident defendant, we examine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction \r\n  over W.W. Norton comports with the requirements of the due process clause.Â  \r\n  See Southern Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. \r\n  256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992).\r\nIn support of their argument that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction over W.W. \r\n  Norton, Appellants cite Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770 \r\n  (1984), where the United States Supreme Court applied the minimum contacts analysis \r\n  to allegations of libel.Â  In Keeton, a New York resident brought a libel \r\n  suit in a New Hampshire court against a nationally circulated magazine publisher \r\n  incorporated in Ohio.Â  Holding that the sale of 10,000 to 15,000 copies of the \r\n  magazine in New Hampshire each month was sufficient to support the assertion \r\n  of jurisdiction in a libel action based on the magazineâ€™s contents, the Court \r\n  noted that â€œregular monthly sales of thousands of magazines cannot by any stretch \r\n  of the imagination be characterized as random, isolated, or fortuitous.â€Â  Keeton, \r\n  465 U.S. at 774; see also Burger King, 471 U.S. at 473 (â€œ[A] publisher \r\n  who distributes magazines in a distant State may fairly be held accountable \r\n  in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly defamatory story.â€).\r\nSimilarly, W.W. Norton has continually endeavored to exploit the South Carolina \r\n  market.Â  W.W. Norton produced discovery documents and responses including a \r\n  list of approximately 315 bookstores in South Carolina in which W.W. Norton \r\n  sold books.Â  Many of these books are sold to educational institutions in South \r\n  Carolina.Â  Stephen King, Chief Financial Officer of W.W. Norton, affirmed that \r\n  twenty-five copies of A Glimpse of Hell were sold to bookstores in South \r\n  Carolina.Â  Furthermore, the book has been purchased by and circulated in libraries \r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Specifically, the Charleston County Public Library has five \r\n  copies which have circulated at least forty-one times.Â  It is reasonable to \r\n  assume that a library will disseminate books in its collection.Â  The check-out \r\n  process and procedure constitutes a separate and distinct dissemination of the \r\n  books which is, in actuality, a republication.\r\nW.W. Norton has published 7,852 titles in the past twenty years and admits \r\n  â€œ[i]t is fair to assume that at least one copy of each title was distributed \r\n  in South Carolina.â€Â  A number of W.W. Nortonâ€™s employees cover South Carolina \r\n  as sales representatives and visit college campuses for the purpose of selling \r\n  books.Â  W.W. Norton has had small book fairs in South Carolina, a media demo, \r\n  and has hosted a breakfast for the English Department at the College of Charleston.Â  \r\n  That the Charleston County Public Library system alone owns 2,900 titles published \r\n  by W.W. Norton is a testament to the publishing companyâ€™s commercial presence \r\n  within South Carolina.Â  In this manner, W.W. Norton has directed its activities \r\n  at the residents of South Carolina, and it must reasonably anticipate being \r\n  haled into court here in a libel action based on the contents of one of its \r\n  publications.Â  See Keeton, 465 U.S. at 775-76.Â  W.W. Nortonâ€™s \r\n  continual practice of marketing and distributing books in South Carolina satisfies \r\n  the power prong of the due process analysis.\r\nWith the power prong satisfied, we turn next to the fairness prong, which requires \r\n  the exercise of jurisdiction to be â€œreasonableâ€ or â€œfair.â€Â  See Southern \r\n  Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 259, 423 S.E.2d 128, \r\n  130 (1992).Â  Under this prong, we look to the following factors to determine \r\n  whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair:\r\n\r\nâ€œthe burden on the defendant[;] . . . the forum stateâ€™s interest in adjudicating \r\n  the dispute; the plaintiffâ€™s interest in obtaining convenient and effective \r\n  relief; the interstate judicial systemâ€™s interest in obtaining the most efficient \r\n  solution to controversies; and the shared interest of the several states in \r\n  furthering fundamental substantive social policies.â€\r\n\r\nSouthern Plastics Co., 310 S.C. at 263, 423 S.E.2d at 132 (quoting World-Wide \r\n  Volkswagen Corp., 444 U.S. 286 (1980)).\r\n We note that the burden on W.W. Norton is negligible because â€œ[n]o \r\n  unconstitutional burden is imposed on a foreign corporation by requiring it \r\n  to defend a suit in a forum located in a state where it has advertised and sold \r\n  a product whose use gave rise to the cause of action.â€Â  Hardy v. Pioneer \r\n  Parachute Co., 531 F.2d 193, 195 (4th Cir. 1976).Â  Moreover, applying the \r\n  relevant factors to the facts of the present case, we perceive no unconstitutional \r\n  unfairness in requiring W.W. Norton to litigate this matter in a forum where \r\n  it has regularly directed its business.Â  Concomitantly, we hold that the trial \r\n  court erred in concluding it did not have personal jurisdiction over W.W. Norton.\r\nII.Â  DOOR CLOSING STATUTE\r\nAppellants assert the trial court erred in determining they were barred from \r\n  bringing suit against W.W. Norton by South Carolinaâ€™s door closing statute.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s door closing statute reads:\r\n\r\nAn action against a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, \r\n  government or country may be brought in the circuit court:\r\n  \r\n(1) By any resident of this State for any cause of action; or\r\n(2) By a plaintiff not a resident of this State when the cause of action shall \r\n  have arisen or the subject of the action shall be situated within this State.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 (1977).Â  Initially, the parties incorrectly frame \r\n  the issue of the door closing statute as one of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Although there has been some confusion on this matter, our Supreme Court recently \r\n  clarified: â€œÂ§ 15-5-150 does not involve subject matter jurisdiction but rather \r\n  determines the capacity of a party to sue.â€Â  Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., \r\n  353 S.C. 553, 557, 579 S.E.2d 325, 327 (2003) (overruling previous holding otherwise).\r\nBecause none of the Appellants are residents of South Carolina, our determination \r\n  of their capacity to sue W.W. Norton turns on whether their cause of action \r\n  arose within this State.Â  In support of their contention that the libel action \r\n  arose in South Carolina, Appellants rely on Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., \r\n  465 U.S. 770 (1984).Â  In Keeton, the United States Supreme Court determined \r\n  the â€œtort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the offending material \r\n  is circulated.â€Â  Id. at 777.Â  The question in Keeton was one of \r\n  jurisdiction.Â  The issue before us is the applicability of the door closing \r\n  statute.\r\nIn Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 356 S.C. 592, 590 S.E.2d \r\n  479 (2003), a latent disease case, the Supreme Court ruled:\r\n\r\nIn order for Janet to bring her suit in South Carolina, she must meet the Door \r\n  Closing Statuteâ€™s requirement that â€œthe cause of action shall have arisen . \r\n  . . within this State.â€Â  Â§ 15-5-150(2).Â  Janetâ€™s complaint unequivocally meets \r\n  the â€œcause of actionâ€ component of this requirement since she alleges that the \r\n  legal wrong occurred in South Carolina when she was exposed to asbestos fibers \r\n  and dust on Fatherâ€™s clothing.Â  Ophuls &amp; Hill v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel \r\n  Co., supra.Â  As the Court of Appeals held, the critical inquiry here \r\n  is whether the cause of action arose within the State. . . . \r\n. . . .\r\nIn traditional tort settings, we have held that a cause of action arises in \r\n  this State for purposes of the Door Closing Statute when the plaintiff has the \r\n  right to bring suit.Â  See Cornelius v. Atlantic Grey Hound Lines, \r\n  177 S.C. 93, 180 S.E. 791 (1935).Â  In construing the statutory requirement that \r\n  â€œthe cause of action shall have arisen . . . within in this State,â€ the Cornelius \r\n  court cited with approval to an authority that â€œstated that â€˜a cause of action \r\n  accrues when facts exist which authorize one party to maintain an action against \r\n  another.â€™â€Â  Id. at 96, 180 S.E. at 792 (emphasis supplied).Â  Cornelius \r\n  is consistent with our later decision in Stephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. \r\n  1, 488 S.E.2d 307 (1997), where we held â€œour cases use the verbs â€˜ariseâ€™ and \r\n  â€˜accrueâ€™ interchangeably when discussing the issue of the juncture at which \r\n  the right to sue came into existence.â€Â  Id. at footnote 4; see also \r\n  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 585 S.E.2d 292 (2003).\r\nWere we to apply our traditional view of when a tort cause of action arises \r\n  or accrues, we must conclude that Janetâ€™s cause of action did not arise â€œwithin \r\n  the Stateâ€ because no injury or damages occurred while she was in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Until the exposure to asbestos resulted in injury or damage, Janetâ€™s tort cause \r\n  of action did not accrue.Â  See e.g., Gray v. Southern Facilities, \r\n  256 S.C. 558, 183 S.E.2d 438 (1971) (â€œIt is basic that a negligent act is not \r\n  in itself actionable and only becomes such when it results in injury or damage \r\n  to anotherâ€).\r\n\r\nId. at ___, 590 S.E.2d at 481-82 (footnotes omitted).\r\nHere, the door closing statute, Â§ 15-5-150, does not bar the Appellants \r\n  from bringing suit against W.W. Norton.Â  In the instant case, there is a continuing \r\n  publication of A Glimpse of Hell in South Carolina upon each sale and \r\n  upon each dissemination.Â  The sale and republication of the book are events \r\n  taking place in South Carolina.Â  The location of the actual â€œprintingâ€ of the \r\n  book is not controlling.\r\nAs set forth in the previous section, the factual record reveals \r\n  with clarity the activities and conduct of W.W. Norton in South Carolina.Â  Indubitably, \r\n  the publication of a libel is a basis for a defamation action.Â  The dissemination \r\n  of the book in South Carolina is a continuing libel in each and every instance.Â  \r\n  The tort of libel occurs wherever the offending material is circulated.Â  Apodictically, \r\n  the causes of action as alleged arose in the state of South Carolina.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s rulings as to Thompson and Meyer \r\n  are AFFIRMED.Â  We REVERSE as to W.W. Norton and REMAND \r\n  to the Circuit Court.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Appellants Moosally, Miceli, Morse, and Finney filed an amended complaint \r\n    on March 15, 2001.Â  Thereafter, on April 12, 2001, Appellant Mortensen filed \r\n    an amended complaint alleging the same causes of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3770","title":"Hinds v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3770\r\nSubmitted January 29, 2004 â€“ Filed April \r\n  5, 2004 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChalmers Carey Johnson, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nSarah E. Wetmore, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n KITTREDGE, J.:Â  This appeal presents \r\n  the question whether a plaintiff in a personal injury action is entitled as \r\n  a matter of law to a favorable verdict where the court directs a verdict against \r\n  the defendant on the issue of negligence and the issues of proximate cause and \r\n  damages are submitted to the trier of fact. [1] Â Â  We hold that a plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  verdict is not mandated under these circumstances. [2] Â  Following a verdict for Respondent Peggy Long \r\n  Elms, Appellants Robert and William Hinds [3]  moved for a new trial â€œas to \r\n  damages only,â€ contending that the defense verdict was a result of improper \r\n  influences since the trial court directed a verdict as to â€œliability.â€Â  The \r\n  Hinds appeal from the denial of their motion for a new trial.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRobert Hinds was involved in three automobile accidents \r\n  during the summer of 1995.Â  This case arises from the second accident.Â  Robert \r\n  was driving his fatherâ€™s truck when it was struck in the rear by the vehicle \r\n  driven by Elms.Â  \r\nAfter the July 12 accident, Robert contacted his \r\n  family doctor, Dr. Skinner, who was unable to schedule him for an immediate \r\n  appointment.Â  An appointment was scheduled with Dr. Skinner for July 24.Â  In \r\n  the interim, Robert was involved in a third automobile accident on July 19.Â  \r\n  Robert did not seek medical treatment immediately following the third accident, \r\n  but instead waited until the previously scheduled July 24 appointment. \r\nThe Hinds initiated the present action in July \r\n  1998, alleging Robert suffered â€œserious, painful and disablingâ€ injuries in \r\n  the July 12, 1995, automobile accident caused by Elmsâ€™ negligence. \r\n  [4] Â  William Hinds sought compensation associated with the damage to his \r\n  Nissan truck, including loss of use and diminution in value. \r\nThe case was tried to a jury.Â  At the close of \r\n  the evidence, the following occurred:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  At the conclusion of the defendantâ€™s case.Â  \r\n  Plaintiff, motions, please.Â  \r\nCOUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFFS:Â  Motion for directed verdict, your \r\n  honor, on the issue of simple negligence.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Granted.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nFollowing a discussion on the defense of comparative \r\n  negligence, counsel for Elms remarked, â€œ[so] in essence itâ€™s now an admitted \r\n  simple negligence case that proceeds on proximate cause and damages?â€Â  The court \r\n  answered, â€œCorrect.â€Â  The trial judge then commented:\r\n\r\nThe defendant herself obviously throughout the trial has \r\n  admitted that at the point and time of the collision she was negligent â€¦ The \r\n  proximate causal connection is still there, obviously, and thatâ€™s the issue \r\n  I expect to be argued most heavily by the defense, as well as the speculative \r\n  nature of the damages that Iâ€™m sure they intend to argue full-fledged.\r\n\r\nThe trial court properly charged the jury on the \r\n  applicable law, including the Hindsâ€™ burden, as plaintiffs, to establish that \r\n  the claimed damages were proximately caused by the admitted negligence.Â  At \r\n  the conclusion of the charge, the trial court reviewed the verdict form with \r\n  the jury, noting the options for â€œplaintiff blank dollars actual damages â€¦ [or] \r\n  for the defendant.â€Â  Prior to deliberations, the trial court invited the parties \r\n  to lodge any exceptions to the charge, to which counsel for the Hinds responded, \r\n  â€œNothing.â€Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUpon receipt of the defense verdict, the \r\n  Hinds, for the first time, argued that the jury had to find in their \r\n  favor and award damages. [5] Â  \r\n  In their motion for a new trial, and before this court, the Hinds assert that \r\n  the trial court directed a verdict â€œto the plaintiff on the issue of liability.â€Â  \r\n  Based on this premise, the Hinds argue they were entitled to an award of damages, \r\n  and the juryâ€™s defense verdict was â€œinconsistent with the law of the case.â€Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe premise of the Hindsâ€™ argument is flawed, for \r\n  the record clearly establishes that the directed verdict was limited to the \r\n  element of negligence. [6] Â  A \r\n  determination of negligence, standing alone, is a far cry from a determination \r\n  of liability.Â  Liability encompasses all elements of a negligence claim, including \r\n  damages proximately caused by the alleged negligence.Â  â€œTo prevail in an action \r\n  founded in negligence, the plaintiff must establish three essential elements: \r\n  (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that \r\n  duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately caused by a \r\n  breach of duty.â€Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 399, 477 S.E.2d 715, \r\n  720 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nIn view of the purported error of the \r\n  trial court in denying the Hindsâ€™ motion for a new trial, we have reviewed the \r\n  evidence.Â  At the time of the July 12, 1995 motor vehicle accident, Robert was \r\n  recovering from injuries from his first accident that summer.Â  Robertâ€™s family \r\n  physician, Dr. Skinner, had diagnosed Robert with musculoskeletal pain, and \r\n  prescribed various medications, as a result of a May 30 automobile accident.Â  \r\n  Following the July 12 accident, Robert drove his fatherâ€™s truck home.Â  He received \r\n  no medical treatment, other than to schedule an appointment with Dr. Skinner \r\n  for July 24.Â  Robertâ€™s third automobile accident occurred on July 19.Â  Robertâ€™s \r\n  claim for damages resulting from the July 12 accident was contested and, indeed, \r\n  was the focus of the trial.Â  The suggestion that the defense verdict resulted \r\n  from improper influences finds no traction in this record.Â  We conclude the \r\n  trial court acted well within its discretion in denying the Hindsâ€™ motion for \r\n  a new trial.Â  Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 334 S.C. 96, 113, \r\n  512 S.E.2d 510, 519 (1998) (â€œThe grant or denial of a new trial motion rests \r\n  within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  unless the trial judgeâ€™s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or \r\n  the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn a personal injury action, a determination of \r\n  negligence, standing alone, does not entitle a plaintiff to a favorable verdict \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Liability encompasses all elements of a negligence claim, \r\n  including damages proximately caused by the negligence.Â  Since the directed \r\n  verdict in favor of the Hinds was limited, in their counselâ€™s words, â€œto the \r\n  issue of simple negligence,â€ there exists no inconsistency in the defense verdict.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, there is no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion for \r\n  a new trial. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Negligence was conceded at trial, resulting in a directed verdict \r\n    on that issue.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  We revisit this basic principle in a published opinion in light of \r\n    the continuing confusion among some members of the bar as to the distinction \r\n    between the element of a negligent act or omission and the concept of liability.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â The primary Appellant is Robert Andrew Hinds.Â  William Henry Hinds \r\n    is Robertâ€™s father and the owner of the 1995 Nissan truck involved in the \r\n    accident.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Robert filed a negligence action in connection with the July 19 accident, \r\n    where he claimed â€œserious, painful and disablingâ€ injuries.Â  In that lawsuit, \r\n    Robert sought to recover the â€œexact same medical bills â€¦ as [he] did in this \r\n    case.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [5]    The Hinds do not attempt to distinguish Robertâ€™s personal injury \r\n    claim from his fatherâ€™s property damage claim.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  We do recognize that â€œwhen liability is admitted, a plaintiff is \r\n    entitled to an award unless proof completely fails.â€Â  Krepps by Krepps \r\n    v.

Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-10 to -165 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2003) (â€œFOIAâ€), requires \r\n  the Sheriff of York County (â€œthe Sheriffâ€) and the York County Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  (collectively, â€œthe Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€) to provide information regarding \r\n  alleged illegal and unethical conduct of four deputy sheriffs to Ray B. Burton, \r\n  III and East Coast Newspapers, Inc. (collectively, â€œBurtonâ€).\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSometime in early 2000, four York County deputy sheriffs were suspended \r\n  without pay for â€œconduct unbecoming an officer.â€Â  The suspension followed an \r\n  internal investigation of a complaint lodged against the deputies by Lori Williams, \r\n  a citizen of York County.Â  After filing her complaint, Williams contacted Burton, \r\n  a reporter for The Herald newspaper, which is published in Rock Hill.Â  \r\n  Williams informed Burton that her complaint to the Sheriffâ€™s Department included \r\n  falsification of investigative reports, possession of stolen property, abuse \r\n  of authority, and sexual activity in patrol cars.\r\n In an effort to obtain more information for a newspaper report, Burton \r\n  submitted written requests to the Sheriffâ€™s Department for access to records \r\n  it possessed relating to Williamsâ€™ complaint and the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s \r\n  response to the complaint.Â  Burton identified two specific categories of information \r\n  he wanted:\r\n\r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  Crime Reports.Â  Burton requested access to reports of all complaints \r\n  or allegations of illegal conduct made against the named deputy sheriffs since \r\n  January 1, 2000, including all complaints made by Williams during that time.\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â  Employment Records.Â  Burton asked to review the employment information \r\n  for the named deputy sheriffs, including â€œdates of employment, title, rank, \r\n  pay-rate schedule, copies of disciplinary letters, records of suspension and \r\n  all other information as provided by law.â€\r\n\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s response only provided information as to the date \r\n  of hire, title/rank, and pay/rate schedule for each of the named deputies.Â  \r\n  It claimed all other information requested was exempt from disclosure under \r\n  FOIA because the information was of a personal nature and disclosing it would \r\n  constitute an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy.Â  The personal privacy \r\n  exemption is provided under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(2) (1991).Â  Alternatively, \r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department claimed the information requested was exempt under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(3) (Supp. 2003) (records of law enforcement activities \r\n  compiled in the process of detecting and investigating a crime the disclosure \r\n  of which would harm an ongoing or prospective law enforcement action) and Â§ \r\n  30-4-40(a)(7) (1991) (â€œ[c]orrespondence or work products of legal counsel for \r\n  a public body and any other material that would violate attorney-client relationshipsâ€).Â  \r\n  Burton initiated this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\r\nAfter conducting an in camera review of the Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Departmentâ€™s records that the Department claimed were exempt from disclosure, \r\n  the trial court concluded the Department had violated the FOIA.Â  The judge â€œpermanently \r\n  enjoined and restrainedâ€ the Sheriffâ€™s Department â€œfrom asserting exemptions \r\n  from mandatory disclosure that have no legal or factual justification, and from \r\n  continuing to refuse to segregate exempt and non-exempt material and make non-exempt \r\n  public records available for inspection and copying.â€\r\nThe trial court found that a portion of the records submitted for in \r\n  camera review revealed information that would lead to an unreasonable \r\n  invasion of personal privacy if disclosed.Â  In its findings of fact, the court \r\n  concluded â€œthe Williamsâ€™ allegations relating to the off-duty sexual practices \r\n  and activities of the deputies is personal and private, as are the photographs \r\n  in the record of Williams and Deputy Sullivan.â€Â  Burton has not appealed or \r\n  otherwise contested this finding.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nBurton sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment pursuant \r\n  to FOIA.\r\nDeclaratory judgments in and of themselves are neither legal nor equitable.Â  \r\n  See Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991); \r\n  Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 580 S.E.2d 163 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003); Wiedemann v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 344 S.C. 233, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 752 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The standard of review for a declaratory judgment \r\n  action is therefore determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Campbell, \r\n  354 S.C. at 279, 580 S.E.2d at 165; see also Goldston v. State Farm \r\n  Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., Op. No. 3749 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 1, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 8 at 52) (stating that because declaratory judgment actions are \r\n  neither legal nor equitable, standard of review depends on nature of underlying \r\n  issues); Travelers Indem. Co. v. Auto World, 334 S.C. 137, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  692 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting that suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal \r\n  nor equitable, but is determined by nature of underlying issue).\r\nA declaratory judgment action under the FOIA to determine whether certain information \r\n  should be disclosed is an action at law.Â  See South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n \r\n  v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843 (1994); Campbell, \r\n  354 S.C. at 280, 580 S.E.2d at 165.Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, \r\n  the appellate courtâ€™s standard of review extends only to the correction of errors \r\n  of law.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 496 S.E.2d 21 (1998); Townes \r\n  Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976); \r\n  Okatie River v. Southeastern Site Prep, 353 S.C. 327, 577 S.E.2d 468 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence \r\n  which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes, 266 S.C. at \r\n  86, 221 S.E.2d at 775; Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 \r\n  S.C. 140, 538 S.E.2d 672 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Sloan v. Greenville \r\n  County, 356 S.C. 531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003) (declaring that in \r\n  actions at law, on appeal of case tried without jury, lower court must be affirmed \r\n  where there is any evidence which reasonably supports judgeâ€™s findings).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n &nbsp;I.Â  FOIA CLAIMS\r\nThe South Carolina Freedom of Information Act is codified as sections \r\n  30-4-10 to â€“165 in the South Carolina Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-10 \r\n  to â€“165 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  Upon request, FOIA mandates disclosure of \r\n  records held by a â€œpublic bodyâ€ unless the documents fall within enumerated \r\n  exemptions.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 30-4-30 to -40 (Supp. 2003).Â  As our \r\n  Legislature explicitly provided in enacting FOIA, disclosure, not secrecy, is \r\n  the dominant objective of the Act:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly finds that it is vital in a democratic \r\n  society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that \r\n  citizens shall be advised of the performance of public officials and of the \r\n  decisions that are reached in public activity and in the formulation of public \r\n  policy.Â  Toward this end, provisions of this chapter must be construed so as \r\n  to make it possible for citizens, or their representatives, to learn and report \r\n  fully the activities of their public officials at a minimum cost or delay to \r\n  the persons seeking access to public documents or meetings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (1991).\r\nThe essential purpose of the FOIA is to protect the public from secret government \r\n  activity.Â  Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  163 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle \r\n  Beach, 345 S.C. 156, 163, 547 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2001) (â€œFOIA was enacted \r\n  to prevent the government from acting in secret.â€); Wiedemann v. Town of \r\n  Hilton Head Island, 330 S.C. 532, 535 n.4, 500 S.E.2d 783, 785 n.4 (1998) \r\n  (noting that â€œ[t]he purpose of the FOIA is to protect the public from secret \r\n  government activityâ€).Â  The FOIA meets the demand for open government while \r\n  preserving workable confidentiality in governmental decisionmaking.Â  Bellamy \r\n  v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 408 S.E.2d 219 (1991); Campbell, 354 S.C. \r\n  at 281, 580 S.E.2d at 166.\r\nâ€œSouth Carolinaâ€™s FOIA was designed to guarantee the public reasonable access \r\n  to certain activities of the government.â€Â  Fowler v. Beasley, 322 S.C. \r\n  463, 468, 472 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1996).Â  The FOIA creates an affirmative duty \r\n  on the part of public bodies to disclose information.Â  Bellamy, 305 S.C. \r\n  at 295, 408 S.E.2d at 221; Campbell, 354 S.C. at 281, 580 S.E.2d at 166.Â  \r\n  The purpose of the FOIA is to protect the public by providing for the disclosure \r\n  of information.Â  Id.Â  The FOIA is remedial in nature and should be liberally \r\n  construed to carry out the purpose mandated by the legislature.Â  Campbell, \r\n  354 S.C. at 281, 580 S.E.2d at 166.\r\nThe exemptions from disclosure under FOIA do not create a duty of \r\n  nondisclosure.Â  Bellamy, 305 S.C. at 295, 408 S.E.2d at 221.Â  At most, \r\n  these exemptions simply allow public agencies the discretion to withhold exempted \r\n  materials from public disclosure.Â  Id.Â  Indeed, consistent with FOIAâ€™s \r\n  goal of broad disclosure, the exemptions from its mandates are to be narrowly \r\n  construed.Â  See Campbell, 354 S.C. at 281, 580 S.E.2d at 166; \r\n  see also Quality Towing, 345 S.C. at 161, 547 S.E.2d at 864-65 \r\n  (stating that FOIA is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed to \r\n  carry out purpose mandated by legislature).Â  Moreover, the determination of \r\n  whether documents or portions thereof are exempt from the FOIA must be made \r\n  on a case-by-case basis.Â  City of Columbia v. ACLU, 323 S.C. 384, 475 \r\n  S.E.2d 747 (1996); Newberry Publâ€™g Co. v. Newberry County Commâ€™n on Alcohol \r\n  &amp; Drug Abuse, 308 S.C. 352, 417 S.E.2d 870 (1992).\r\nIn this appeal, the Sheriffâ€™s Department argues the trial court erred in its \r\n  application of FOIA.Â  First, the Sheriffâ€™s Department claims the Department \r\n  is not a â€œpublic bodyâ€ as defined by FOIA and is therefore not subject to its \r\n  strictures.Â  Alternatively, the Sheriffâ€™s Department maintains the information \r\n  Burton sought is exempt from disclosure under FOIA because its release would \r\n  constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.Â  We address these arguments \r\n  seriatim.\r\nA.Â  â€œPublic Bodyâ€ \r\n  under FOIA\r\n1.Â  Sheriff as â€œpublic bodyâ€\r\nThe key operative provision of FOIA provides: â€œAny person has a right \r\n  to inspect or copy any public record of a public body, except \r\n  as otherwise provided by Â§ 30-4-40, in accordance with reasonable rules concerning \r\n  time and place of access.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(a) (1991) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  FOIA defines â€œpublic bodyâ€ for the purposes of the Act: \r\n\r\nâ€œPublic bodyâ€ means any department of the State, . . . any \r\n  state board, commission, agency, and authority, any public or governmental body \r\n  or political subdivision of the State, including counties, municipalities, townships, \r\n  school districts, and special purpose districts, or any organization, corporation, \r\n  or agency supported in whole or in part by public funds or expending public \r\n  funds, including committees, subcommittees, advisory committees, and the like \r\n  of any such body by whatever name known, and includes any quasi-governmental \r\n  body of the State and its political subdivisions . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-20(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  This Court does not need to look \r\n  any further than the language of the statute to find the Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  is subject to FOIA.Â  See Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. \r\n  361, 373, 585 S.E.2d 292, 298 (2003) (â€œWhen the language of a statute is plain, \r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the application of standard \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation is unwarranted. . . . The statutory terms, \r\n  therefore, must be applied according to their literal meaning.â€) (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nWe first note that the office of the sheriff was created by our state constitution, \r\n  which grants the General Assembly authority to determine their duties, qualifications, \r\n  training, and compensation. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 24; see also \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-11-110 (Supp. 2003) (prescribing the qualifications of sheriffs); \r\n  Botchie v. Oâ€™Dowd, 299 S.C. 329, 332 n.3, 384 S.E.2d 727, 729 n.3 (1989) \r\n  (noting that the South Carolina Constitution â€œauthorizes the election of a sheriff \r\n  as a county officerâ€).Â  The Sheriffâ€™s Department, therefore, clearly falls within \r\n  the compass of the plain meaning of â€œpublic or governmental body or political \r\n  subdivision of the Stateâ€ under section 30-4-20(a).\r\n2.Â  Efficacy of Weston v. Carolina Research\r\nFurthermore, the Sheriffâ€™s Department is supported exclusively by \r\n  public funds.Â  Sheriff Bruce Bryant testified that the Departmentâ€™s annual budget \r\n  was â€œapproximately thirteen million dollars,â€ all of which was received through \r\n  York County tax revenue and federal grants.\r\nOur Supreme Court has ruled the fact that an organization, corporation, or \r\n  agency is supported in whole or in part by public funds or expends public funds \r\n  is sufficient grounds alone to find the organization is a â€œpublic bodyâ€ under \r\n  FOIA, regardless of any other factors.Â  See Weston v. Carolina Research \r\n  &amp; Dev. Found., 303 S.C. 398, 401 S.E.2d 161 (1991).Â  The Weston \r\n  Court explained its reading of the statute:\r\n\r\nThe [Defendantâ€™s] argument that the FOIA only applies to \r\n  governmental and quasi-governmental bodies would rewrite the statutory definition \r\n  of â€œpublic bodyâ€ by deleting the phrase, â€œor any organization, corporation, \r\n  or agency supported in whole or in part by public funds or expending public \r\n  funds.â€Â  According to the [Defendantâ€™s] position, a corporation that cannot \r\n  be labeled governmental or quasi-governmental would be exempt from the FOIA, \r\n  regardless of whether it received support from public funds or expended public \r\n  funds.Â  Such a construction would obliterate both the intent and the clear meaning \r\n  of the statutory definition.\r\n\r\nId at 403, 401 S.E.2d at 164.\r\nTherefore, based solely on the fact that the Sheriffâ€™s Department is supported \r\n  exclusively by public funds, we are compelled to find the Department is a â€œpublic \r\n  bodyâ€ subject to the mandates of FOIA.\r\nB.Â  In Camera \r\n  Review\r\nUnder the FOIA, an in camera review of documentary \r\n  material is mandated where there exists any controversy in regard to the production \r\n  of contested documents.\r\nIn Newberry Publâ€™g Co. v. Newberry County Commâ€™n on Alcohol &amp; \r\n  Drug Abuse, 308 S.C. 352, 417 S.E.2d 870 (1992), the Supreme Court inculcated:\r\nSection 30-4-40(b) provides that:\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf any public record contains material which is \r\n  not exempt under subsection (a) of this section, the public body shall separate \r\n  the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available \r\n  in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.\r\n  \r\nThe Observer contends that the trial judge erred \r\n  in failing to segregate the nonexempt and exempt portions of the report and \r\n  to provide the Observer with the nonexempt material, as is mandated by section \r\n  30-4-40(b).Â  We agree.\r\n. . . We find that SLEDâ€™s policy of denying all FOIA requests for \r\n  criminal investigative reports, without determining whether portions of the \r\n  report are subject to disclosure, is in direct contravention of the clear language \r\n  of the FOIA.\r\n. . . [T]he report may not be entirely exempt from disclosure; the statute goes \r\n  on to state that a public record containing both nonexempt and exempt material \r\n  must be segregated so that the nonexempt material is made available to the public.Â  \r\n  As a result, we reject SLEDâ€™s contention that this, or any, criminal investigative \r\n  report is per se exempt from disclosure.\r\n. . . .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn sum, we emphasize that law enforcement agencies do not have carte blanche \r\n  to deny all FOIA requests for criminal investigative reports.Â  The information \r\n  contained in these reports can be withheld from disclosure only to the extent \r\n  that it falls within one or more of the exemptions enumerated in section 30-4-40(a).Â  \r\n  The determination as to which portions of a report are exempt and which portions \r\n  must be disclosed should be done on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nId. at 354-56, 417 S.E.2d at 873.Â  Thereafter, the Court, in City \r\n  of Columbia v. ACLU, 323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996), explicated: â€œBefore \r\n  Appellant becomes entitled to the report, the trial court must first examine \r\n  the report in detail in order to determine whether the reportâ€™s contents or \r\n  portions thereof qualify for an exemption under Â§ 30-4-40.â€Â  Id. at 388-89, \r\n  475 S.E.2d at 750.\r\nIn the case sub judice, the trial court conducted an \r\n  in camera review resulting in a fact-specific analysis of producible \r\n  documents as juxtaposed to protected documents.Â  The actual materials and documents \r\n  reviewed in an in camera hearing constitute evidence in the case.Â  \r\n  The sealed documents reviewed by the trial court have been examined by this \r\n  Court and support the order issued by the trial court.\r\nC.Â  Privacy Exemption\r\nThough the purpose of FOIA is to create an affirmative duty on the part of \r\n  public bodies to disclose information, the Act enumerates fifteen categories \r\n  of public records that may be exempt from mandatory disclosure.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  The category relevant to \r\n  the present case is known as the â€œprivacy exemption.â€Â  Section 30-4-40(a)(2) \r\n  exempts from disclosure â€œ[i]nformation of a personal nature where the public \r\n  disclosure thereof would constitute unreasonable invasion of personal privacy.â€Â  \r\n  We find the specific information Burton seeks does not fall within the purview \r\n  of this exemption.\r\nSection 30-4-40(a)(2) does not specifically list or define the types of records, \r\n  reports, or other information that should be classified as personal or private \r\n  information exempt from disclosure.Â  We must, therefore, resort to general privacy \r\n  principles, which examination involves a balancing of conflicting interestsâ€”the \r\n  interest of the individual in privacy on the one hand against the interest of \r\n  the publicâ€™s need to know on the other.\r\nOur Supreme Court has defined the â€œright to privacyâ€ as the right \r\n  of an individual to be let alone and to live a life free from unwarranted publicity. \r\n  Â Sloan v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 355 S.C. 321, 586 S.E.2d \r\n  108 (2003).Â  However, â€œâ€˜one of the primary limitations placed on the right of \r\n  privacy is that it does not prohibit the publication of matter which is of legitimate \r\n  public or general interest.â€™â€Â  Society of Profâ€™l Journalists v. Sexton, \r\n  283 S.C. 563, 566, 324 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1984) (quoting Meetze v. Associated \r\n  Press, 230 S.C. 330, 95 S.E.2d 606 (1956)).Â  Indeed, the Court has held \r\n  that, as a matter of law, â€œif a person, whether willingly or not, becomes an \r\n  actor in an event of public or general interest, â€˜then the publication of his \r\n  connection with such an occurrence is not an invasion of his right to privacy.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Doe v. Berkeley Publishers, 329 S.C. 412, 414, 496 S.E.2d 636, 637 (1998) \r\n  (quoting Meetze, 230 S.C. at 337, 95 S.E.2d at 609).\r\nIn the present case, we find the manner in which the employees of \r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department prosecute their duties to be a large and vital public \r\n  interest that outweighs their desire to remain out of the public eye.Â  The newspaper, \r\n  in fulfilling its obligation to report on and hold to account those in public \r\n  service, had a legitimate need to access the records Burton requested.Â  Burton \r\n  and the newspaper did not seek information regarding the off-duty sexual activities \r\n  of the deputies involved.Â  Rather, the access to information they sought and \r\n  the trial court granted was focused on the performance of public duties by the \r\n  Sheriff and his deputies and the response of the Department to allegations of \r\n  misconduct by the deputies.\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding that the information requested \r\n  by Burton was not exempt under section 30-4-40(a)(2) of the Act.\r\nD.Â  Right to Privacy \r\n  under the United States Constitution\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department contends that disclosing the information \r\n  Burton requested would violate the deputiesâ€™ â€œright to privacyâ€ guaranteed by \r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  The Department \r\n  essentially raises this argument twice: (1) as grounds for exemption under FOIA \r\n  from disclosure of â€œ[m]atters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute \r\n  or law,â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(4) (1991 &amp; Supp. 2003); and (2) as \r\n  a defense entirely separate from the FOIA regime.Â  Either way, we find the argument \r\n  is without merit.\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall â€œdeprive any \r\n  person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .â€Â  U.S. \r\n  Const. amend XIV, Â§ 1.Â  From this broad language, the United States Supreme \r\n  Court has extrapolated a number of principles used to evaluate whether laws \r\n  enacted by the state and federal governments are reasonable, fair, and supported \r\n  by adequate justification.Â  These Fourteenth Amendment principles are generally \r\n  grouped together under the label of â€œsubstantive due process.â€Â  Among these \r\n  substantive due process guarantees exists what the Supreme Court has termed \r\n  a â€œright of privacy.â€\r\nUnlike the privacy rights implicated under section 30-4-40(a)(2) \r\n  of FOIA or under the common law tort of invasion of privacy, the right of privacy \r\n  subsumed under the Fourteenth Amendment has been narrowly defined and limited \r\n  to specific situations:\r\n\r\n[I]n terms of due process and equal protection the â€œright \r\n  to privacyâ€ has come to mean a right to engage in certain highly personal activities.Â  \r\n  More specifically, it currently relates to certain rights of freedom of choice \r\n  in marital, sexual, and reproductive matters.Â  Even this definition may be too \r\n  broad, for the Court still has not recognized any general right to engage in \r\n  sexual activities that are done in private.Â  Instead, the Justices have acknowledged \r\n  the existence of a â€œrightâ€ and defined it by very specific application to laws \r\n  relating to reproduction, contraception, abortion, and marriage.\r\n\r\nRonald D. Rotunda &amp; John E. Nowak, 3 Treatise on Constitutional Law: \r\n  Substance and Procedure Â§ 18.26 (3d ed.) (1999); see also, e.g., \r\n  Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485 (1965) (recognizing a â€œright \r\n  of privacyâ€ in marriage stemming from the â€œzone of privacy created by several \r\n  fundamental constitutional guaranteesâ€); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153 \r\n  (1973) (holding that right of privacy in matters concerning procreation and \r\n  family â€œis broad enough to encompass a womanâ€™s decision whether or not to terminate \r\n  her pregnancyâ€); Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977) \r\n  (invalidating ordinance that barred certain family living arrangements); Lawrence \r\n  v. Texas, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (2003) (holding that a statute making it a crime \r\n  for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct \r\n  violates the â€œright of privacyâ€ guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the \r\n  Fourteenth Amendment).\r\nBy raising this constitutional argument, the Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  urges this Court to add another category of protection to the privacy rights \r\n  the Supreme Court has found under the Fourteenth Amendment: the right of an \r\n  individualâ€™s performance of his public duties to be free from public scrutiny.Â  \r\n  We find this would be ill-advised.Â  Unless and until the Supreme Court rules \r\n  otherwise, we will follow its precedent and not expand the â€œright of privacyâ€ \r\n  under the Fourteenth Amendment beyond those situations which the Court has ruled \r\n  bear on the most intimate decisions affecting personal autonomyâ€”namely reproductive \r\n  rights, familial and marital relations.\r\nII.Â  VALIDITY OF \r\n  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department maintains the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in issuing an injunction.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order that its mandate of disclosure be enforced, there is a statutory \r\n  presumption that no adequate remedy at law exists for a violation of FOIA and \r\n  that injured parties are entitled to appropriate equitable relief:\r\n\r\nAny citizen of the State may apply to the circuit court \r\n  for either or both a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to enforce the \r\n  provisions of this chapter in appropriate cases . . . . The court may order \r\n  equitable relief as it considers appropriate, and a violation of this chapter \r\n  must be considered to be an irreparable injury for which no adequate remedy \r\n  at law exists.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-100(a) (1991); see also Business License Opposition \r\n  Comm. v. Sumter County, 311 S.C. 24, 426 S.E.2d 745 (1992) (upholding trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of injunction prohibiting a public body from holding future secret \r\n  meetings in violation of FOIA); Florence Morning News, Inc. v. Building Commâ€™n \r\n  of City and County of Florence, 265 S.C. 389, 218 S.E.2d 881 (1975) (upholding \r\n  trial courtâ€™s injunction prohibiting defendants from interfering with the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  right to inspect and copy original records in possession of a public body). \r\n\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department clearly violated the provisions of FOIA \r\n  by withholding non-exempt documents that were the subject of a legitimate request \r\n  and failing to segregate exempt and non-exempt materials for disclosure.Â  The \r\n  award of equitable injunctive relief was therefore entirely appropriate.\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department alleges the injunction granted by the trial \r\n  court was overly broad.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe injunction issued in the trial courtâ€™s order provided that â€œdefendants \r\n  are permanently enjoined and restrained from asserting exemptions from mandatory \r\n  disclosure that have no legal or factual justification, and from continuing \r\n  to refuse to segregate exempt and non-exempt material and make non-exempt public \r\n  records available for inspection and copying.â€Â  The Sheriffâ€™s Department avers \r\n  this injunction â€œdid not set forth specific reasons for its issuance or describe \r\n  in reasonable detail the acts to be restrained.â€Â  The Department argues â€œthe \r\n  permanent injunction prevents the defendants from asserting statutory and constitutional \r\n  exemptions under [FOIA]â€ and â€œextends beyond the records requested in this case \r\n  to all information and records in possession of the defendants in perpetuity.â€\r\nReading the trial courtâ€™s order as a whole, the reasons for the \r\n  injunction and the acts it intends to proscribe are amply clear.Â  The trial \r\n  court, in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, discussed at length the \r\n  FOIA violation and the records ultimately subject to disclosure.Â  We do not \r\n  read the trial courtâ€™s order as compelling the production of records which are \r\n  exempt under FOIA.Â  To the extent that any of the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s records \r\n  are exempt under section 30-4-40 of FOIA, the Department is not obligated to \r\n  disclose them.Â  We find no error with the issuance of the injunction or its \r\n  scope.\r\nIII.Â  HEARSAY OBJECTION\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department contends the trial court erred in allowing \r\n  certain testimony of Terry Plumb, claiming it was inadmissible hearsay.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nTerry Plumb, editor of The Herald during the relevant time \r\n  period, testified about the events leading up to the FOIA request and the present \r\n  action.Â  Part of Plumbâ€™s testimony concerned a conversation he had with Burton \r\n  regarding the story he was developing relating to the allegations made against \r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  Plumb stated:\r\n\r\nWell, I asked Ray [Burton] what this was all about, and \r\n  he told me that a woman by the name of Lori Williams had been arrested on public \r\n  disorderly conduct.Â  This woman further related she had been a complainant against \r\n  a deputy and that she had had an affair with him, and they had a falling out.Â  \r\n  She told Ray that [the deputy] had threatened to distribute photographs of her \r\n  in the nude and that she had reported this to the Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  They \r\n  had seized his car, found photographs in question of this woman, and that there \r\n  had been an investigation by the Sheriffâ€™s department and that he and several \r\n  other deputies had been suspended, and that the shiftâ€”[t]he 300 shift, I believe, \r\n  it was called, had been reorganized because of the scandal that emanated from \r\n  this particular incident.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department raised a contemporaneous objection that this testimony \r\n  was inadmissible hearsay.Â  The trial court overruled the objection and allowed \r\n  the testimony.\r\nHearsay is â€œa statement, other than one made by the declarant while \r\n  testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of \r\n  the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  â€œProof of a statement introduced \r\n  to show a party heard and acted upon information is not objectionable hearsay.â€ \r\n  Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 354 S.C. 445, 454, 581 S.E.2d \r\n  489, 493 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Webb v. Elrod, 308 S.C. 445, \r\n  449, 418 S.E.2d 559, 562 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œProof of a statement introduced for \r\n  the purpose of showing a party relied and acted upon it is not objectionable \r\n  on the ground of hearsay.â€).\r\nPlumbâ€™s statement is a clear example of showing an action based upon \r\n  information and is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.Â  Reviewing \r\n  Plumbâ€™s statement in the context of his testimony as a whole, it is apparent \r\n  the statement was not offered to prove that Williams had an affair with a deputy, \r\n  that Williams had filed a complaint, that an investigation had been conducted, \r\n  or that deputies had been suspended.Â  The testimony was merely offered to show \r\n  why the newspaper was requesting access to the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s records.\r\nBecause the statement was not hearsay, the trial court did not err \r\n  in allowing its admission as evidence.\r\nIV.Â  ATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nBy way of cross-appeal, Burton appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of \r\n  its request for attorneyâ€™s fees as the prevailing party.Â  Burton maintains the \r\n  trial court abused its discretion by failing to enter its findings regarding \r\n  its denial of the fee request.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder FOIA, â€œ[i]f a person or entity seeking such relief prevails, he or it \r\n  may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and other costs of litigation.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-100(b) (1991).Â  As a general rule, the amount of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to be awarded in a particular case is within the discretion of the trial \r\n  judge.Â  Baron Data Systems, Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 \r\n  (1989); see also Litchfield Plantation Co. v. Georgetown County Water \r\n  &amp; Sewer Dist., 314 S.C. 30, 443 S.E.2d 574 (1994) (finding that, as \r\n  Â§ 30-4-100(b) provides attorneyâ€™s fees may be awarded, judge has discretion \r\n  to award fees); Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274, \r\n  580 S.E.2d 163 (Ct. App. 2003) (where one party prevails in his claim for information \r\n  under FOIA, Circuit Court has discretion to award attorneyâ€™s fees).Â  The award, \r\n  however, must be reasonable and supported by adequate findings.Â  Baron Data \r\n  Systems, 297 S.C. at 384, 377 S.E.2d at 297.\r\nThere are six factors for the trial court to consider when determining an award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) \r\n  the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional \r\n  standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results \r\n  obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Jackson v. \r\n  Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997).Â  Upon request for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees that are authorized by contract or statute, the trial court should make \r\n  specific findings of fact on the record for each of these factors.Â  See \r\n  Jackson, 326 S.C. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760 (â€œ[O]n appeal, an award for \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient evidence in the record \r\n  supports each factor.â€); Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, \r\n  427 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1993) (â€œWhen an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is requested and \r\n  authorized by contract or statute, the court should make specific findings of \r\n  fact on the record for each factor.â€).\r\nIn Society of Profâ€™l Journalists v. Sexton, 283 S.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d \r\n  313 (1984), a FOIA case, the appellant urged the Court to reverse the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee award on grounds that DHEC acted in good faith reliance on its regulation.Â  \r\n  The Supreme Court declined to do so, holding the â€œtrial judge did not abuse \r\n  his discretion in awarding fees to encourage agencies to comply with FOIA requests.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 568, 324 S.E.2d at 316.\r\nIn its order, the trial court addresses the request for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees in a wholly conclusory fashion: â€œThe award is discretionary with the Court, \r\n  and the Court declines to award fees in this case.â€Â  The court did not consider \r\n  or enter findings for the factors outlined in Jackson v. Speed as mandated \r\n  by our Supreme Court.Â  We must, therefore, remand this matter to the trial court \r\n  for a full and proper consideration of the attorneyâ€™s fees request.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  is AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED for further disposition.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3773","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert \r\n  M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  Thomas Wayne Richardson \r\n  appeals his convictions for criminal sexual conduct, third degree and criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor, second degree.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 1999, Richardson met SS \r\n  [1] , pastor of a Greenville church, during revival services at another \r\n  local church.Â  Richardson befriended SS by informing him that he represented \r\n  the Richardson Family Foundation (the â€œFoundationâ€), an organization that helped \r\n  churches and individuals obtain federally funded grants.Â  Richardson participated \r\n  in several services at SSâ€™s church.\r\nKS, SSâ€™s sixteen-year-old daughter, met Richardson \r\n  through her parents.Â Â  Prior to this meeting, KS had heard Richardson speak \r\n  at her fatherâ€™s church several times.Â  During these speaking engagements, Richardson \r\n  informed the congregation that he helped churches and intended to help rebuild \r\n  the church and its related facilities.\r\nOn August 20, 1999, KSâ€™s parents asked her to provide \r\n  administrative help to Richardson.Â  On that day, Richardson was working in his \r\n  hotel room.Â  KS testified Richardson made sexual advances when the two were \r\n  alone.Â Â  Immediately after she refused his requests, KSâ€™s parents returned to \r\n  the hotel room.Â  She did not tell her parents about what had happened because \r\n  she was afraid and in shock.\r\nThe next day, SS invited Richardson to stay at \r\n  his home.Â  KS, her parents, and her seven brothers and sisters also lived in \r\n  the home, including TS, KSâ€™s fourteen-year-old sister.Â  KS testified \r\n  she helped Richardson with some of his paperwork while he was a guest.Â  During \r\n  one of these sessions, Richardson demanded that she go into the closet in her \r\n  room and pull her pants down.Â  When she questioned him, he responded that he \r\n  would not help her church or anybody in the ministry if she told anyone.Â  Richardson \r\n  then had sexual intercourse with her.\r\nKS testified Richardson asked her to perform oral \r\n  sex on another occasion.Â  She further stated that Richardson came to her room \r\n  several times and had sexual intercourse with her.Â  When KS asked Richardson \r\n  if what he was doing was wrong, Richardson claimed it was not wrong and justified \r\n  his response with scriptures.Â  During this time, Richardson told her the people \r\n  in the ministry would not get anything if she did not comply or if she told \r\n  anyone.\r\nKS claimed the encounters with Richardson affected \r\n  her performance in school and caused her to have headaches and stomach aches.Â  \r\n  On October 28, 1999, KS broke down and told her school principal that Richardson \r\n  raped her at the family home.Â  TS also admitted to being sexually assaulted \r\n  by Richardson. \r\nTS revealed similar behavior by Richardson.Â  She \r\n  testified that one evening Richardson entered her room and made sexual advances.Â  \r\n  TS refused his requests.Â  Later in the evening, Richardson came to her room \r\n  while she was asleep.Â  He then got into her bed and began touching her.Â  While \r\n  he was doing this, he told TS that if she told anyone he would not help her \r\n  church or her family.Â  According to TS, Richardson removed her clothing and \r\n  began to have sexual intercourse with her.Â  When she asked Richardson to stop, \r\n  he reiterated that he would not do anything for the church or her family if \r\n  she did not comply. TS testified Richardson came to her room at night on several \r\n  other occasions.Â Â  She did not tell her parents about the incidents because \r\n  she was embarrassed and afraid to say anything.\r\nFollowing the discussions with the girls and their \r\n  school principal, SS and his wife immediately informed the Greenville County \r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department about what had happened to their daughters.Â  An investigation \r\n  was conducted which included both KS and TS undergoing a sexual assault examination.Â  \r\n  After the investigation was completed, a Greenville County grand jury indicted \r\n  Richardson for one count of criminal sexual conduct, third degree as to KS and \r\n  one count of criminal sexual conduct with a minor, second degree as to TS.\r\nRichardson testified in his own defense. \r\n  Â He denied raping or molesting either KS or TS, but admitted to having \r\n  an affair with their mother. \r\n The jury convicted Richardson of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct, third-degree and criminal sexual conduct with a minor, second-degree.Â  \r\n  The judge sentenced Richardson to five years imprisonment for criminal sexual \r\n  conduct, third degree and ten years imprisonment for criminal sexual conduct \r\n  with a minor, second-degree.Â  The sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  \r\n  Richardson appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nRichardson argues the trial court erred by denying \r\n  his motions for a directed verdict concerning the charge of criminal sexual \r\n  conduct, third degree.Â  He contends the evidence failed to establish that he \r\n  used force or coercion to accomplish a sexual battery on KS.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, Richardson \r\n  moved for a directed verdict as to the charge of criminal sexual conduct, third \r\n  degree.Â  He asserted there was no evidence of force or coercion.Â  Specifically, \r\n  he contended the element of coercion required â€œthreats of violence.â€Â  He also \r\n  argued that even if the evidence could be construed that Richardson persuaded \r\n  KS to engage in sexual intercourse, persuasion alone was not sufficient to constitute \r\n  coercion.Â Â  At the conclusion of the case, Richardson renewed his motion.Â  The \r\n  trial judge denied both motions.\r\nWhen reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, \r\n  this Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 \r\n  S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 364, 574 S.E.2d \r\n  203, 205 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find \r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 \r\n  S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State \r\n  v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171 (2003), cert. denied, \r\n  124 S. Ct. 101 (2003).Â  Therefore, â€œwhere the facts of the case, even if proved, \r\n  do not constitute the alleged criminal conduct, a directed verdict must be granted.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Jackson, 338 S.C. 565, 569, 527 S.E.2d 367, 369 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nâ€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct \r\n  in the third degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim and \r\n  . . . [t]he actor uses force or coercion to accomplish the sexual battery in \r\n  the absence of aggravating circumstances.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16&#8209;3&#8209;654(1)(a) \r\n  (2003); see State v. Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 354, 510 S.E.2d 220, \r\n  222 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œCriminal sexual conduct in the third degree specifies \r\n  the actor must use force or coercion without aggravating circumstances to accomplish \r\n  the sexual battery.â€).Â  \r\nÂ Our Supreme Court has found that â€œforceâ€ and â€œcoercionâ€ \r\n  as used in section 16-3-654 have â€œbasically the same meaning.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Hamilton, 276 S.C. 173, 178, 276 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1981).Â  â€œThey â€˜mean to \r\n  make a person . . .Â  follow a prescribed and dictated course; . . . to inflict \r\n  or impose:Â  force oneâ€™s will on someone.â€™â€ Id. (quoting American Heritage \r\n  Dictionary 513).Â Â  The State, in order to prove criminal sexual conduct \r\n  in any degree, must prove â€œâ€˜that the sexual battery occurred under circumstances \r\n  where the victimâ€™s consent was lacking.â€™â€ Id. (quoting State v. Cox, \r\n  274 S.C. 624, 628, 266 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1980)).\r\n Viewed in the light most favorable to \r\n  the State, the evidence was sufficient to submit to the jury the charge of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct, third degree.Â  Richardson presented himself as someone who could \r\n  provide significant financial assistance to KSâ€™s family and her church. By inviting \r\n  Richardson into his home, SS conveyed to his family that he was interested in \r\n  what Richardson could offer.Â  KS testified, and her parents corroborated, that \r\n  she had been raised in the church and taught to respect her elders and people \r\n  in positions of authority.Â  Based on these values, she was afraid that she would \r\n  be punished if she did not do what Richardson asked her to do.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  KS testified that Richardson had sexual intercourse with her despite her refusals \r\n  and her questioning whether he was wrong in what he was doing.Â  According to \r\n  KS, Richardson supported his actions by quoting scriptures.Â  KS testified she \r\n  was also concerned that her family and church would be deprived of Richardsonâ€™s \r\n  assistance if she failed to comply with his requests. Â Additionally, \r\n  she denied she was a willing participant.\r\nBased on this evidence, a jury could reasonably \r\n  infer that Richardson used coercion to accomplish the sexual battery on KS.Â  \r\n  KS viewed Richardson as an authority figure who relied on religion to support \r\n  his actions.Â  This authority coupled with Richardsonâ€™s repeated threat to withhold \r\n  his assistance could have intimidated KS to the point of overcoming her will.Â  \r\n  See State v. Hardy, 409 S.E.2d 96, 98 (N.C. Ct. App. 1991) (â€œ[A]uthority \r\n  itself intimidates; the implicit threat to exercise it coerces.Â  Coercion . \r\n  . . is a form of constructive force.â€ (quoting State v. Etheridge, 352 \r\n  S.E.2d 673, 681-82 (N.C. 1987))).Â  Although Richardson contends KS consented \r\n  and never complained, this alone does not entitle him to a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  Instead, it creates a question of fact in terms of credibility.Â  See \r\n  State v. Burroughs, 328 S.C. 489, 495, 492 S.E.2d 408, 411 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (finding trial court did not err in denying defendantâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict in case involving criminal sexual conduct, third degree, given credibility \r\n  question was created where defendant claimed the encounter was consensual and \r\n  the victim testified she refused and was in fear for her life).Â  \r\nFurthermore, we are not persuaded by Richardsonâ€™s \r\n  argument that the evidence â€œat best . . . supports an attempt to convince KS \r\n  not to disclose a sexual relationship, but does not support force or \r\n  coercion to actually engage in one.â€Â  Initially, we note this specific \r\n  argument was not raised during Richardsonâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\n  As such, we question whether it is preserved for our review.Â  See State \r\n  v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (stating a party cannot \r\n  argue one theory at trial and a different theory on appeal). In any event, the \r\n  dichotomy that Richardson attempts to create between statements to prevent a \r\n  victim from reporting the incident and statements meant to coerce a victim is \r\n  without merit.Â  Both types of statements may be coercive, especially in this \r\n  case where KS testified there was a continued pattern of abuse. Even if there \r\n  were such a distinction, it would not be applicable in this case given KS asserted \r\n  that she rebuffed Richardson until he warned her that her non-compliance would \r\n  jeopardize his offers of help to the church.Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nRichardson argues the trial judge erred in admitting \r\n  prejudicial evidence that had the effect of attacking his character.Â  He contends \r\n  the solicitor asked him improper questions concerning:Â  (1) whether Richardson \r\n  considered himself a â€œman of God,â€ and (2) the nature and history of the Foundation.Â  \r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, the solicitor asked \r\n  Richardson whether he considered himself a â€œman of God.â€Â  Richardson objected \r\n  to the question on the ground of relevancy.Â  The judge overruled the objection.Â  \r\n\r\nLater in the cross-examination, the solicitor \r\n  inquired about the nature and history of Richardsonâ€™s foundation.Â  When the \r\n  solicitor asked about the Foundationâ€™s addresses in other states, Richardson \r\n  objected.Â  Out of the presence of the jury, Richardson argued the solicitor \r\n  was trying to question him about matters related to the pending charge of obtaining \r\n  goods under false pretenses.Â  He contended the charge was not at issue during \r\n  the trial and it constituted a â€œbad actâ€ under Lyle. \r\n  [2] Â  The solicitor responded the questions went to Richardsonâ€™s credibility \r\n  and established the coercive nature of his acts involving KS and TS.Â  The judge \r\n  sustained the objection. \r\nThe solicitor continued the cross-examination \r\n  by asking Richardson what representations he had made to the congregations in \r\n  Greenville.Â  Richardson generally objected.Â  The judge overruled the objection.Â  \r\n  Richardson testified the Foundation could assist churches in developing programs \r\n  to obtain government subsidies and grants.\r\nâ€œThe relevance, materiality, and admissibility \r\n  of evidence are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a \r\n  ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2003).Â  An abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State \r\n  v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  \r\nInitially, we note Richardsonâ€™s argument concerning \r\n  the â€œman of Godâ€ questioning is not preserved for our review.Â  At trial, Richardson \r\n  objected to this question on the ground of relevancy.Â  On appeal, Richardson \r\n  asserts the question placed his character at issue.Â  Because Richardson objected \r\n  to the testimony on a different ground at trial than what he argues on appeal, \r\n  this argument is not properly before this Court.Â  See State v. Myers, \r\n  344 S.C. 532, 535, 544 S.E.2d 851, 853 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding where defendant \r\n  objected at trial on the ground that testimony was irrelevant, he could not \r\n  argue on appeal that testimony improperly placed his character at issue); see \r\n  also State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 295, 534 S.E.2d 268, 269 (2000) \r\n  (holding a party cannot argue one ground below and then argue another ground \r\n  on appeal); State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 113, 485 S.E.2d 360, 363 (1997) \r\n  (stating to be preserved for appeal, an issue must be raised to and ruled on \r\n  by the trial judge).\r\nIn any event, we find no error in the admission \r\n  of the challenged testimony.Â  First, the solicitorâ€™s questioning did not elicit \r\n  â€œprior bad actâ€ evidence.Â  See Rule 404(b), SCRE (â€œEvidence of other \r\n  crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person \r\n  in order to show action in conformity therewith.Â  It may, however, be admissible \r\n  to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence \r\n  of mistake or accident, or intent.â€); Lyle, 125 S.C. at 415-16, 118 S.E. \r\n  at 807 (South Carolina law precludes evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior crimes \r\n  or other bad acts to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime charged except \r\n  to establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence of mistake or accident, \r\n  (4) a common scheme or plan, or (5) the identity of the perpetrator.).Â  The \r\n  resulting testimony regarding the history and the work of the Foundation cannot \r\n  be construed as substantive evidence constituting a â€œbad actâ€ under Lyle.Â  \r\n  Nor did it establish that Richardson had a propensity to commit criminal sexual \r\n  conduct.Â  Furthermore, the judge excluded any potential â€œbad actâ€ evidence when \r\n  he sustained Richardsonâ€™s objection to the solicitorâ€™s apparent attempt to delve \r\n  into the charge for obtaining goods under false pretenses.Â  \r\nSecondly, the evidence was relevant as to the issue \r\n  of Richardsonâ€™s alleged coercion of KS and TS.Â  See Rule 401, SCRE (â€œâ€˜Relevant \r\n  evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency to make, the existence of any fact \r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less \r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€).Â  Because KS and TS testified \r\n  Richardson threatened to withhold from their church the Foundationâ€™s assistance \r\n  if they did not comply with Richardsonâ€™s sexual demands, it was relevant as \r\n  to why they in fact complied.Â  Specifically, the evidence established the basis \r\n  of Richardsonâ€™s authority over KS and TS.Â  Furthermore, the testimony was relevant \r\n  to Richardsonâ€™s credibility given he denied ever sexually assaulting either \r\n  KS or TS.Â  See State v. Outlaw, 307 S.C. 177, 179, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  147, 148 (1992) (â€œIt is well-settled that when a defendant takes the stand he \r\n  becomes subject to impeachment like any other witness.Â  The defendant may be \r\n  asked about prior bad acts, not the subject of a conviction, which go to his \r\n  credibility.â€)(citations omitted). \r\nIn a related argument, Richardson contends that \r\n  even if the testimony did not involve a prior bad act under Lyle, the \r\n  evidence effectively attacked his character.Â  See Rule 404(a), SCRE (stating \r\n  evidence of a personâ€™s character or character trait is inadmissible for the \r\n  purpose of establishing the person acted in conformity with that particular \r\n  character or trait on a particular occasion); State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. \r\n  1, 6, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (1998) (â€œBoth rules [Lyle and that regarding \r\n  character evidence] are grounded on the policy that character evidence is not \r\n  admissible â€œfor purposes of proving that the accused possesses a criminal character \r\n  or has a propensity to commit the crime with which he is charged.â€ (quoting \r\n  State v. Peake, 302 S.C. 378, 380, 396 S.E.2d 362, 363 (1990))).Â  We \r\n  disagree with Richardsonâ€™s contention and find the evidence concerning the Foundation \r\n  and Richardsonâ€™s involvement in it did not serve the purpose of tending to prove \r\n  Richardson sexually assaulted KS or TS.Â  Rather, the evidence served to substantiate \r\n  the testimony of KS and TS regarding their reasons for complying with Richardsonâ€™s \r\n  demands.\r\nEven if the challenged testimony constituted improper \r\n  â€œcharacter evidence,â€ any error in its admission was harmless.Â  The testimony \r\n  was cumulative to other similar testimony that was admitted without objection.Â  \r\n  See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448 \r\n  (2003) (stating the erroneous admission of prior bad act evidence is harmless \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt if its impact is minimal in the context of the entire \r\n  record); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993) \r\n  (finding any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to \r\n  evidence is harmless); State v. Johnson, 298 S.C. 496, 499, 381 S.E.2d \r\n  732, 733 (1989) (stating admission of improper evidence is harmless where it \r\n  is merely cumulative to other evidence); see also State v. Reeves, \r\n  301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990) (holding error is harmless when \r\n  it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial).Â  KS, TS, SS \r\n  and his wife all testified without objection that Richardson told them and SSâ€™s \r\n  congregation that the Foundation would assist the church and individuals obtain \r\n  federal grants to further the ministry. Â Additionally, the solicitor \r\n  questioned Richardson without objection about the Foundation.\r\nIII.\r\nRichardson argues the trial judge erred in permitting \r\n  the solicitor to make improper and prejudicial comments to the jury during closing \r\n  arguments.Â  Specifically, he contends the comments constituted a direct attack \r\n  on his credibility.Â  \r\nRichardson failed to make any objection during \r\n  closing arguments.Â  He also failed to move for a mistrial on the ground of improper \r\n  argument.Â  As such, this issue is not properly preserved for our review.Â  See \r\n  State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 550, 500 S.E.2d 489, 496 (1998) (stating \r\n  failure to object to comments made during argument precludes appellate review \r\n  of the issue); State v.

We further find that the ALJ properly \r\n  considered evidence not presented to DHEC in a preceding Staff Review Hearing \r\n  because the evidence was related to issues presented during that hearing.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse and remand to the circuit court to reinstate the decision of the \r\n  ALJ.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDOSC filed its application for a certificate of \r\n  need with DHEC in 1998, seeking to construct an ambulatory surgery center in \r\n  Bennettsville.Â  The Hospitals opposed the application.Â  \r\nDHEC conducted a Staff Review Hearing on the application \r\n  during which both parties presented information supporting their respective \r\n  positions.Â  In particular, the Hospitals argued that the proposed outpatient \r\n  surgery center would adversely impact the Hospitals and need for the center \r\n  was insufficient.Â  DHEC recommended approval of the application for the certificate \r\n  of need.\r\nThe Hospitals requested a contested case hearing \r\n  before the ALJ.Â  The ALJ conducted a hearing over a seven-day period, during \r\n  which both sides presented evidence and testimony from eighteen witnesses.Â  \r\n  After making findings of fact, the ALJ concluded the application did not meet \r\n  the legal criteria for approval of the certificate of need.Â  The ALJâ€™s decision \r\n  was based in part on the lack of need of a facility and in part on the negative \r\n  impact the facility would have on the Hospitals.\r\nDOSC appealed this decision to the DHEC \r\n  Board.Â  In a hearing lasting a little over one hour, the DHEC Board heard oral \r\n  arguments from both parties.Â  It subsequently issued its order reversing the \r\n  order of the ALJ and granting the certificate of need.Â  The Board set forth \r\n  its own findings of fact that contradicted many of the ALJâ€™s findings.\r\nThe Hospitals appealed to the circuit \r\n  court, which affirmed the DHEC Boardâ€™s decision.Â  The Hospitals subsequently \r\n  filed a motion for reconsideration, which the circuit court denied.Â  This appeal \r\n  follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Boardâ€™s Standard of Review\r\nThe Hospitals argue the Board improperly \r\n  found facts according to its own view of the evidence utilizing a de novo \r\n  standard.Â  We agree.\r\nThe ALJ presides over all hearings of contested \r\n  DHEC permitting cases.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  In such cases, the ALJ serves as the finder of fact.Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t \r\n  of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560 S.E.2d 410, 413 (2002).Â  \r\n  On appeal of such a contested case, a reviewing tribunal â€œmust affirm the ALJ \r\n  if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, not based on the [Boardâ€™s] \r\n  own view of the evidence.â€Â  Dorman v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n  350 S.C. 159, 166, 565 S.E.2d 119, 123 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Here, DHECâ€™s Board \r\n  indisputably sat in an appellate capacity when reviewing the ALJâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  We find that the DHEC board erred by applying a de novo standard of review \r\n  rather than a â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard. \r\n  [1] \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ALJâ€™s Consideration of New Evidence\r\nThe Hospitals further assign error to \r\n  the DHEC Boardâ€™s determination, with which the circuit court concurred, that \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) (Supp. 2000) confines contested hearings before \r\n  the ALJ to the exact evidence considered during the preceding Staff Review Hearing.Â  \r\n  We agree with this assignment of error.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe DHEC Board held that the ALJ erred \r\n  in considering evidence not presented during the Staff Review Hearing, all of \r\n  which undisputedly related to core issues addressed during that hearing. [2] Â  Relying on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E), the \r\n  Board stated that â€œparties are not allowed to submit new or additional facts \r\n  for consideration at the contested case hearing which were not part of the administrative \r\n  record at the time of the [DHEC Staff Review Hearing.]â€ \r\n  [3] Â  We find the DHEC Boardâ€™s interpretation of Section 44-7-210(E) erroneous.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.â€Â  Strother \r\n  v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, \r\n  121 (1998).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one \r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the \r\n  intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, \r\n  Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  The words of the statute \r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or \r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Hitatchi \r\n  Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  \r\n\r\nHere, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) states â€œ[t]he \r\n  issues considered at the contested case hearing are limited to those \r\n  presented or considered during the staff review and decision process.â€Â  (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  However, the DHEC Board expansively interpreted the statute to preclude \r\n  the ALJ in contested hearings from receiving any evidence not presented \r\n  to DHEC during a Staff Review Hearing.Â  We reject this interpretation, finding \r\n  it conflicts with the plain language of the statute and the ordinary meaning \r\n  of the word â€œissuesâ€ as used in this context.\r\nAdditionally, the interpretation advanced \r\n  by the DHEC Board and circuit court is inconsistent with applicable case law \r\n  providing a de novo review for ALJ hearings conducted in a posture similar \r\n  to that in the case at bar.Â Â  See Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d at 413 (noting that when reviewing a contested case on appeal, the ALJ \r\n  conducts a de novo hearing with the presentation of evidence and testimony.).Â  \r\n  A trial de novo is one in which â€œthe whole case is tried as if no trial \r\n  whatsoever had been had in the first instance.â€Â  Blizzard v. Miller, \r\n  306 S.C. 373, 375, 412 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1991).Â Â  Moreover, when reviewing a \r\n  contested case on appeal, â€œ[t]he ALJ, as the fact-finder, must make sufficiently \r\n  detailed findings supporting the denial [or grant] of a permit application.â€Â  \r\n  Converse Power Corp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 \r\n  S.C. 39, 46, 564 S.E.2d 341, 345 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œDetailed findings enable \r\n  [an appellate court] to determine whether such findings are supported by the \r\n  evidence . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  Here, because the ALJ was conducting a de \r\n  novo hearing, we find that he properly considered the evidence presented \r\n  in his pursuit to make â€œsufficiently detailed findingsâ€ of fact for subsequent \r\n  review.Â  \r\nBased on our interpretation of the unambiguous \r\n  language in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) (Supp. 2000) and case law providing \r\n  the ALJ a de novo review in contested hearings arising from a DHECâ€™s \r\n  Staff Review Hearing, we conclude that the DHEC Board erred in expanding the \r\n  term â€œissuesâ€ to include â€œevidence.â€Â  In light of the DHEC Boardâ€™s error, we \r\n  consequently find that the circuit court erred in its acquiescence to the DHECâ€™s \r\n  Board position.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Substantial Evidence\r\nThe Hospitals contend there was substantial \r\n  evidence to support the ALJâ€™s finding that the certificate of need should be \r\n  denied.Â  In particular, they maintain substantial evidence was presented to \r\n  show the proposed facility would adversely impact the two existing facilities \r\n  and the need for a new facility was insufficient.Â  Consequently, based upon \r\n  the credible evidence as determined by the ALJ, the application \r\n  would not comply with the State Health Plan, thus requiring a denial of the \r\n  permit by DHEC.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(C) (2002), DHEC must \r\n  deny a Certificate of Need if an application does not comply with the State \r\n  Health Plan.Â  Under the applicable State Health Plan, approval of an ambulatory \r\n  surgical facility requires that six certain criteria must be met.Â  These criteria \r\n  include proof of a documented need for the facility and a discussion on the \r\n  impact on existing facilities.Â  The State Health Plan also ranked nine criteria \r\n  to be considered while reviewing DOSCâ€™s application.Â  The nine criteria in order \r\n  of importance to DHEC are need, community need documentation, distribution (accessibility), \r\n  acceptability, efficiency, adverse effect on other facilities, record of the \r\n  Applicant, ability to complete the project, and financial feasibility. [4] \r\nAs previously discussed, review of the ALJâ€™s factual \r\n  determinations is measured by the substantial evidence standard.Â  Substantial \r\n  evidence is not merely a scintilla of evidence, nor is it evidence viewed blindly \r\n  from one side.Â  Leventis v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n  340 S.C. 118, 130, 530 S.E.2d 643, 650 (2000)Â  Â Instead, substantial evidence \r\n  is evidence that, in light of the whole record, allows reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the reviewing tribunalâ€™s conclusion.Â  Id.Â  Here, the Hospitals, as the \r\n  moving parties, bore the burden of proving that DOSCâ€™s requested certificate \r\n  of need should be denied.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210(E) (Supp. 2000) \r\n  (â€œThe burden of proof in a reconsideration or contested case hearing must be \r\n  upon the moving party.â€).Â  \r\nThe ALJ found the Hospitals adequately demonstrated \r\n  that the proposed facility would have a significant adverse impact on the two \r\n  Hospitals and that there was not sufficient need demonstrated to justify the \r\n  new facility.Â  Given evidence presented at the ALJ hearing regarding the lack \r\n  of full utilization of the Hospitalsâ€™ current facilities, the probability that \r\n  the new facility will not be able to recapture enough patients to meet its projections, \r\n  and the result that patients would be taken from the Hospitals, we find substantial \r\n  evidence existed in the record before the ALJ to support the ALJâ€™s decision \r\n  denying the certificate of need.Â  We do recognize the evidence to the contrary.Â  \r\n  But, as noted, the appropriate standard of review precludes a de novo \r\n  review on appeal.Â  Where, as here, reasonable minds could reach the same decision \r\n  as the ALJ, that decision is supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the circuit \r\n  court to reinstate the decision of the ALJ. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We are well aware that the DHEC Boardâ€™s brazen attitude \r\n    and utter disregard for the proper standard of review created the procedural \r\n    chaos that followed.Â  The parties, in their respective filings with the Board, \r\n    conceded that the substantial evidence standard governed the review of the \r\n    ALJâ€™s factual determinations.Â  In defiance of the partiesâ€™ concession and \r\n    applicable law, the DHEC Board made its own findings of fact, and unapologetically \r\n    refused to consider the entire record developed in the contested hearing before \r\n    the ALJ. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Two core issues addressed in DHECâ€™s Staff Review Hearing \r\n    addressed (1) whether there was sufficient need for the proposed facility, \r\n    and (2) the extent to which, if any, the proposed facility would have an adverse \r\n    impact on the Hospitals.Â Â  The ALJ considered evidence related to these issues, \r\n    including the following evidence not presented during the preceding Staff \r\n    Review Hearing:Â  (1) expert testimony regarding need and adverse impact of \r\n    the center because the experts were hired subsequent to the hearing; (2) the \r\n    Hospitalsâ€™ Joint Annual Reports;Â  (3) 1997 outmigration data compiled by the \r\n    Budget and Control Board; and (4) information on the impact of the federal \r\n    1997 Balanced Budget Actâ€™s reduction in payments to health care providers.Â  \r\n    This evidence dealt squarely with the issues before the ALJ.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The circuit court did not specifically address this issue \r\n    in oral arguments, its subsequent written order, or in response to the Hospitalsâ€™ \r\n    motion for reconsideration.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The State Health Plan also adds:Â  â€œ[DHEC] will continue to evaluate \r\n    applications for ambulatory surgery centers on their individual merit.Â  However, \r\n    it is the determination of [DHEC] that the benefits of improved accessibility \r\n    will not outweigh the adverse affects caused by the duplication of existing \r\n    services or equipment.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3775","title":"Gordon v.

Koon, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nJustin Oâ€™Toole Lucey, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  Respondent Frank Gordon [1]  brought this action against Rudolph \r\n  Robert Drews alleging the illegal sale of stock in a corporation, misrepresentation, \r\n  and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The trial court: (1) found Drews liable for the \r\n  sale of unregistered securities in the sum of $50,000; (2) dismissed the other \r\n  claims; and (3) awarded interest and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Drews appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDrews and his business partner, Raymond \r\n  Beasley, decided to open a hardware store in the West Ashley area of Charleston \r\n  in 1996.Â  The store, known as Builders Station, was incorporated, and its board \r\n  of directors approved a business plan and capital structure that provided for \r\n  the sale of stock to outside investors. Â Â \r\nDrews and Beasley agreed that each \r\n  would own a twenty-five percent share of stock in Builders Station.Â  The other \r\n  half of the outstanding shares would be sold to outside investors.Â  Drews and \r\n  Beasley also agreed they would each acquire an additional one-half share for \r\n  each share issued to outsiders.Â  Ultimately, Builders Station had eleven shareholders. \r\n\r\nAmong the investors the company was able to attract \r\n  was Frank Gordon.Â  On several occasions, Gordon discussed with Drews and Beasley \r\n  the possibility of investing in the new store.Â  Before agreeing to purchase \r\n  shares, Gordon asked about the capital structure of the company.Â  Gordon testified \r\n  he expressed concern that â€œthe monies put in by investors were no where [sic] \r\n  near sufficient.â€Â  Drews reportedly tried to allay his concern by informing \r\n  Gordon the company anticipated receiving a $250,000 loan that would be guaranteed \r\n  by the Small Business Administration.Â  Gordon also claimed Drews and Beasley \r\n  made oral representations that receipt of the loan was all but certain by assuring \r\n  Gordon it was a â€œdone dealâ€ or â€œin the bag.â€Â Â  After receiving assurances from \r\n  Drews and Beasley, Gordon purchased fifty shares at $1,000 per share.Â  \r\nThe $250,000 loan, however, never came to fruition.Â  \r\n  When Drews originally negotiated the terms of the loan, he agreed to pledge \r\n  several parcels of real property he owned as collateral.Â Â  He later sought to \r\n  revise the terms, seeking a right of indemnification for his collateral, additional \r\n  compensation, or both.Â  Drewsâ€™ attempts to renegotiate the loan delayed and \r\n  ultimately prevented its consummation.\r\nThe companyâ€™s board of directors (of which all \r\n  eleven shareholders were members) learned of the dispute over the guaranty and \r\n  collateralization of the SBA loan in November 1996.Â  Despite the Boardâ€™s additional \r\n  attempts to obtain the loan, the issue was never resolved.Â  The Board later \r\n  decided to end Drewsâ€™ relationship with the company.Â  Ultimately, a â€œRelease \r\n  and Settlement Agreementâ€ was executed releasing Drews and the shareholders \r\n  from all liability arising out of their business relationship with the corporation.Â  \r\n  Though a majority of the shareholders signed the Release, Frank Gordon refused. \r\n\r\nThe business did not succeed and ultimately closed \r\n  in October 1997. \r\nGordon brought suit against Drews, claiming \r\n  the sale of stock was illegal and fraudulent under section 35-1-1490 of the \r\n  Uniform Securities Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 35-1-10 to -1590 (Supp. 2003). [2] Â Â  He also asserted claims for \r\n  common-law misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with \r\n  Drewsâ€™ sale of the stock.Â Â  \r\nThe trial court found Drews was liable \r\n  under section 35-1-1490(1) for the illegal sale of unregistered securities.Â  \r\n  The court concluded, however, that Drews was not liable for the fraudulent sale \r\n  of stock under section 35-1-1490(2), nor for common-law misrepresentation or \r\n  breach of fiduciary duty. Â Â Drews appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 35-1-1490 provides that a person \r\n  who purchases a security as a result of an illegal or fraudulent sale or offer \r\n  â€œmay sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration paid for the \r\n  security.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-1490 (Supp. 2003).\r\nTo determine whether this suit is legal or equitable, \r\n  we must look to the â€œmain purposeâ€ of the action as reflected by the nature \r\n  of the pleadings and proof, and the character of relief sought under them. Ins. \r\n  Fin. Servs., Inc. v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d \r\n  315, 318 (1978); see also Alford v. Martin, 176 S.C. 207, \r\n  212, 180 S.E. 13, 15 (1935) (findingÂ  â€œ[t]he character of an action is determined \r\n  by the complaint in its main purpose and broad outlines and not merely by allegations \r\n  that are merely incidentalâ€); Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina v. Daniels, \r\n  283 S.C. 438, 440, 322 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 1984) (noting that, although \r\n  the determination of whether an action is legal or equitable â€œmust be determined \r\n  from the character of the action as framed in the complaint,â€ the court may \r\n  also consider â€œthe prayer for relief and any other facts and circumstances which \r\n  throw light upon the main purpose of the actionâ€).\r\nIn this action, the only cause of action before \r\n  this Court is Gordonâ€™s claim seeking return of the price he paid for the Builders \r\n  Supply stock.Â  Furthermore, this was the exclusive remedy allowed by the trial \r\n  court.Â  The action, therefore, is rescissionary in nature and is appropriately \r\n  reviewed under the equitable standard of review. See Brown v. Greenwood \r\n  Sch. Dist. 50 Bd. of Trustees, 344 S.C. 522, 525, 544 S.E.2d 642, 643 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001) (holding an action to rescind a contract was equitable in nature).\r\nAccordingly, this Court may â€œfind facts in accordance \r\n  with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.â€ Townes Assocs. v. City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  Our broad scope \r\n  of review, however, does not require this Court to disregard the findings of \r\n  the trial judge â€œwho saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to judge their credibility.â€Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, \r\n  105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Drewsâ€™ Liability Under the Securities \r\n  Act\r\nThe South Carolina Uniform Securities Act prohibits \r\n  the sale of securities in this state unless the securities are properly registered \r\n  with the securities commissioner or the securities are subject to an exemption.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-810 (Supp. 2003).Â  Drews admits the Builders \r\n  Supply stock at issue in this case was not registered with the commissioner.Â  \r\n  Drews, however, claims he is not liable for the illegal sale of stock because \r\n  (A) the stock offering was an exempt transaction under the Securities Act, and \r\n  (B) he did not participate in the sale of the stock.Â  \r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Exemption from Registration Requirement\r\n\r\nDrews argues the trial court erred in finding the \r\n  offering of stock in Builders Station was not exempt from registration as a \r\n  limited offering.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere are numerous registration exemptions \r\n  provided for under the Securities Act in sections 35-1-310 and 35-1-320.Â  Only \r\n  one of these exemptionsâ€”the â€œlimited offeringâ€ exemptionâ€”arguably applies in \r\n  the present case.Â  Section 35-1-320(9) defines this exemption, in pertinent \r\n  part, as follow:\r\n\r\nAny transaction pursuant to an \r\n  offer directed by the offeror to not more than twenty-five persons . . . in \r\n  this State during any period of twelve consecutive months, whether or not the \r\n  offeror or any of the offerees is then present in this State, if (a) the seller \r\n  reasonably believes that all the buyers in this State . . . are purchasing for \r\n  investment and (b) no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly \r\n  or indirectly for soliciting any prospective buyer in this State.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-320(9) (Supp. 2003).Â  Specifically \r\n  at issue in the present case is (1) whether Drews offered the Builders Station \r\n  stock to more than twenty-five people and (2) whether Drews received remuneration \r\n  for soliciting the potential buyers.\r\nWe are mindful that we must narrowly construe \r\n  exemptions under the Act because the securities laws are remedial in nature \r\n  and, therefore, should be liberally construed to protect investors.Â  McGaha \r\n  v. Mosley, 283 S.C. 268, 273, 322 S.E.2d 461, 464 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  in arguing the Builders Station stock was exempt from the Actâ€™s registration \r\n  requirements, Drews bears the burden of proving he was entitled to the claimed \r\n  exemption.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-340 (Supp. 2003).Â  We find he has failed to \r\n  satisfy this burden.\r\n\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Number of Offerees\r\n\r\nWe find Drews failed to sufficiently prove \r\n  he offered Builders Station stock to no more than twenty-five people.Â  \r\nDrews presented no evidence regarding the number \r\n  of people to whom he offered stock.Â  Raymond Beasley, Drewsâ€™ original business \r\n  partner, testified that Drews probably offered the stock to â€œdozensâ€ of people.Â  \r\n  He further testified, â€œI believe we did it to more than 25 peopleâ€ and that \r\n  Drews offered the stock to â€œdozens and dozens.â€\r\nDrews attempts to circumvent \r\n  this obvious lack of proof by arguing the limited offering exemption applies \r\n  when there are not more than twenty-five â€œultimate purchasersâ€ of the offered \r\n  security.Â  This assertion is without merit.Â  \r\nAs always, we look first \r\n  to the plain meaning of the statute when interpreting its language.Â  See \r\n  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d \r\n  843, 846 (1992) (holding that words used in a statute â€œmust be given their plain \r\n  and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit \r\n  or expand its operationâ€).Â  Under the plain language of section 35-1-320(9), \r\n  we find this Court is compelled to reject Drewsâ€™ contention that the exemption \r\n  applies to all transactions involving twenty-five or fewer â€œpurchasers.â€Â  The \r\n  statute speaks only in terms of an â€œoffer,â€ not a â€œsaleâ€ or â€œpurchase.â€Â  The \r\n  Securities Act specifically defines â€œofferâ€ and â€œoffer to sellâ€ as including \r\n  â€œevery attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a \r\n  security or interest in a security for value.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-20(13)(b) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  We glean no intent on the part of the General Assembly to veer \r\n  from the plain meaning of this statutory language.\r\nThough our courts have not \r\n  addressed the application of our stateâ€™s limited offering exemption, similar \r\n  exemptions under the federal securities laws have been interpreted to require \r\n  a consideration of the number of offerees, not ultimate purchasers.Â  See, \r\n  e.g., Doran v. Petroleum Mgmt. Corp., 545 F.2d 893, 900 (5th Cir. \r\n  1977) (holding that under the private offering exemption of 15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 77d(2), \r\n  â€œ[t]he number of offerees, not the number of purchasers, is the relevant figure \r\n  in considering the number of persons involved in an offeringâ€); SEC v. Kenton \r\n  Capital, Ltd., 69 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 1998) (finding the â€œnumber of \r\n  offereesâ€ to be a critical factor in determining whether the private placement \r\n  exemption applies); see also 69A Am. Jur. 2d Securities \r\n  Regulation Â§ 143 (1993) (commenting that â€œthe failure to prove the number \r\n  of offerees, not the number of ultimate purchasers, is fatal to the claim of \r\n  the [limited offering] exemptionâ€).\r\nAlthough there were only eleven â€œultimate purchasersâ€ \r\n  in this case, a clear reading of the statute reveals that it is the number of \r\n  offerees, not the number of ultimate purchasers, with which we are concerned.Â  \r\n  The only evidence presented concerning this question was Beasleyâ€™s testimony \r\n  that the stock was offered to more than twenty-five people.Â  Because Drews did \r\n  not introduce any evidence to the contrary, we conclude Drews failed to meet \r\n  his burden to prove Builders Supply stock was offered to no more than twenty-five \r\n  persons.\r\n\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Remuneration for Sales\r\n\r\nWe find Drews is also barred from claiming \r\n  the limited offering exemption because he received compensation for his sales \r\n  of the Builders Supply stock.Â  \r\nFor each share of Builders Supply stock \r\n  Drews sold to outside investors, he received an additional one-half share of \r\n  stock.Â  Drews argues he and Beasley each received an additional one-half share \r\n  in order to maintain their status as fifty percent shareholders in the corporation, \r\n  not as compensation for selling stock.Â  We disagree with this characterization.\r\nAgain, we look first to the plain meaning \r\n  of the statutory language.Â  â€œRemunerationâ€ is defined as â€œpayment; compensationâ€ \r\n  and â€œthe act of paying or compensating.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1298 \r\n  (7th ed. 1999).Â  Other jurisdictions have held that similar share distribution \r\n  schemes constituted compensation for purposes of determining remuneration under \r\n  their securities laws.Â  See, e.g., PIC Oil Co. v. Grisham, \r\n  702 P.2d 28, 33 (Okl. 1985) (holding that receipt of securities by promoters \r\n  for prices substantially below those paid by outside investors amounted to indirect \r\n  compensation because the â€œeffect of the interests retained by the [promoters] \r\n  was to dilute the equity paid by outside investors and to mislead [the outside \r\n  investors] . . . into believing that [promoters] were contributing a proportionate \r\n  share of capital for interests retainedâ€); Prince v. Heritage Oil Co., \r\n  311 N.W.2d 741, 746 (Mich. App. 1981) (holding the sale of undivided fractional \r\n  interests in oil and gas leases constituted the sale of securities, and the \r\n  retention of leasehold working interests in the wells amounted to remuneration).\r\nThere is no question that the additional shares \r\n  Drews received when selling the stock represented an increase in the value of \r\n  his interest in the corporation.Â  For every two shares Drews sold, he received \r\n  another share.Â  Thus, he received something of value for work he performed.Â  \r\n  We conclude the trial court did not err in finding Drews was remunerated for \r\n  the sale of Builders Supply stock.\r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Liability as Seller of Unregistered \r\n  Security\r\n\r\nDrews contends the trial court erred in \r\n  finding he was liable as a â€œperson who offers or sells a securityâ€ as defined \r\n  under the Securities Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 35-1-1490 is the operative provision \r\n  imposing liability on those who engage in the illegal sale of stock.Â  In pertinent \r\n  part, it provides: \r\nAny person who:\r\n\r\n(1) offers or sells a security in violation [of the registration \r\n  requirements of the Securities Act] . . . or\r\n(2) Offers or sells a security by means of any untrue statement \r\n  of material fact or any omission to state a material fact . . . , the buyer \r\n  not knowing of the untruth or omission, and who does not sustain the burden \r\n  of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could \r\n  not have known, of the untruth or omission;\r\nIs liable to the person buying the security from him . . . \r\n  .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-1490 (Supp. 2003). [3] Â  \r\nIn evaluating subsection (2) of this statute, our \r\n  Supreme Court defined a person â€œwho offers or sells a securityâ€ in Biales \r\n  v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 432 S.E.2d 482 (1993).Â  The Biales court \r\n  expressly adopted the â€œfinancial benefits testâ€ articulated by the United States \r\n  Supreme Court in Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d \r\n  658 (1988), interpreting a federal law comparable to subsection (1). [4] Â  The Court held that a person â€œwho offers or \r\n  sells a securityâ€ within the meaning of the Securities Act â€œis not limited to \r\n  the owner who passes titleâ€; however, to come within the definition, â€œa nonowner \r\n  must (1) solicit the purchase, and (2) be motivated at least in part by a desire \r\n  to serve his own financial interest or that of the owner of the security.â€Â  \r\n  Biales, 315 S.C. at 169, 432 S.E.2d at 484-85.Â  In Biales, the \r\n  Court found that an escrow agent, who had disbursed funds arising from the purchase \r\n  of securities in property to his client, did not offer, solicit an offer, or \r\n  pass title to an alleged security within the meaning of the Securities Act where \r\n  the agent had not â€œpersuaded or urgedâ€ the creditor to purchase the securities \r\n  in the property.Â  Id. at 170, 432 S.E.2d at 485.Â  The Court went on to \r\n  adopt the Pinter definition as applicable to the entire statute.Â  Id. \r\n  (â€œWe, therefore, adopt the Pinter definition of a person â€œwho offers \r\n  or sells a securityâ€ as applicable to section 35-1-1490.â€).\r\nWe are convinced by the evidence in the \r\n  record that Drews actively solicitedâ€”that is, persuaded or urgedâ€”Gordon to purchase \r\n  shares in Builders Supply.Â  Drews admitted he met with Gordon at Drewsâ€™ office \r\n  to discuss investing in Builders Supply, at which time Drews provided Gordon \r\n  with promotional materials he had prepared. Beasley testified that Drewsâ€™ â€œspecific \r\n  and total jobâ€ was to raise capital for the new business.Â Â  He also testified \r\n  that: â€œFrank Gordon was told by the two principal stockholders of Builders Station, \r\n  Raymond Beasley and R.R. Drews, that financing was in place, and the SBA loan \r\n  had been procured, in the bag . . . awaiting final signings.â€ \r\nWe also find sufficient evidence to conclude \r\n  Drewsâ€™ solicitation of Gordon was motivated at least in part by a desire to \r\n  serve his own financial interests and that of his fellow shareholders, thus \r\n  satisfying the second prong of the Biales/Pinter test.Â  It can \r\n  hardly be disputed that the success of the Builders Supply venture depended \r\n  on the ability of Beasley and Drews to raise sufficient capital.Â  Therefore, \r\n  they had a direct financial incentive to market and sell shares in the new company.\r\nAccordingly, we find no error with the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding Drews was liable for the illegal sale of stock.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Release and Settlement Agreement\r\nDrews next argues the trial court erred in finding \r\n  Gordon was not bound by the Release and Settlement Agreement executed by a majority \r\n  of the Builders Station board members.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is undisputed that \r\n  Gordon did not sign the agreement.Â  Drews, however, contends the release was \r\n  binding against Gordon even though he did not sign it because he â€œaccepted the \r\n  benefits of the release.â€ \r\nDrews argues this result is mandated by our Supreme \r\n  Courtâ€™s holding in Watson v. Coxe Bros. Lumber Co., 203 S.C. 125, 26 \r\n  S.E.2d 401 (1943).Â  We find this case inapposite.Â  Watson involved an \r\n  employee of the lumber company that had been injured on the job.Â  When the employee \r\n  brought suit against the company for damages, the company claimed it had been \r\n  released from liability when it paid the employee an agreed-upon settlement.Â  \r\n  The Court held that the employee must return the settlement payment before suing \r\n  on the underlying action. Â Id. at 135, 26 S.E.2d at 404.\r\nUnlike the injured employee in Watson, Gordon \r\n  did not enter into an agreement to receive any compensation or other benefit \r\n  in exchange for Drewsâ€™ resignation.Â  The â€œbenefitâ€ Drews claims Gordon allegedly \r\n  received was â€œan incremental increase in [his] percentage of stock in relation \r\n  to the outstanding number of shares.â€Â  Again, unlike Watson, this â€œbenefitâ€ \r\n  was not bargained for by Gordon, nor was Gordon capable of returning this â€œbenefitâ€ \r\n  to the company since the change in his percentage ownership was merely incidental \r\n  to the fixed number of shares he had purchased.Â  \r\nFurthermore, any claim that Gordon impliedly â€œratifiedâ€ \r\n  the agreement without signing it is equally without merit.Â  The record reflects \r\n  that, at the board of directors meeting during which the settlement agreement \r\n  was presented and signed, Gordon specifically asked Builders Supplyâ€™s corporate \r\n  attorney whether he would be bound by the agreement if he did not sign.Â  He \r\n  was told he would not be so bound.\r\nFor these reasons, we find the trial court correctly \r\n  ruled Gordon was not bound by the Release and Settlement Agreement.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Laches\r\nDrews also asserts Gordonâ€™s claims are barred \r\n  by laches. We disagree.\r\nâ€œLachesâ€ is defined as â€œneglect for an \r\n  unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity \r\n  for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, \r\n  Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 296, 519 S.E.2d 583, 598 (Ct. App. 1999); Treadaway \r\n  v. Smith,Â  325 S.C. 367, 378, 479 S.E.2d 849, 855-56 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œDelay \r\n  alone is not enough to constitute laches; it must be unreasonable, and the party \r\n  asserting laches must show prejudice.â€Â  Brown v. Butler, 347 S.C. 259, \r\n  265, 554 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2001); Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. \r\n  195, 130 S.E.2d 525 (1988).\r\nParties seeking recovery under section 35-1-1490 \r\n  must tender their securities before recovering the consideration paid for the \r\n  shares.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-1490 (Supp. 2003).Â  Gordon tendered his shares \r\n  during the trial.Â  Drews asserts Gordonâ€™s claims are barred by laches because \r\n  he tendered his securities more than four years after Builders Supply ceased \r\n  business operations.Â  \r\nSection 35-1-1510, however, provides: â€œAny tender \r\n  specified in Section 35-1-1490 may be made at any time before entry of judgment.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-1510 (Supp. 2003).Â  Gordon, therefore, tendered his shares \r\n  within the statutorily prescribed time limit.Â  Accordingly, we will not apply \r\n  the equitable doctrine of laches in a manner that would subvert this explicit \r\n  statutory provision.\r\nMoreover, we discern no prejudice to Drews due \r\n  to Gordonâ€™s delay in tendering his shares.Â  Gordon filed his initial complaint \r\n  over one and one-half years before the action went to trial.Â  Drews had no reason \r\n  to believe Gordon would not tender his shares within the time period allowed \r\n  by statute.\r\nWe conclude the trial court was correct to deny \r\n  Drewsâ€™ request to dismiss Gordonâ€™s claims as barred by laches.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nLastly, Drews argues the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  award of $42,693.50 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Gordon was unreasonable.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  to be awarded in a particular case is within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  \r\n  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 385-86, 377 S.E.2d 296, \r\n  298 (1989).Â  The award, however, must be reasonable.Â  Id.\r\nThere are six factors for the trial court to consider \r\n  when determining an award of attorneyâ€™s fees: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty \r\n  of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional \r\n  standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results \r\n  obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Jackson v. \r\n  Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  Upon request for \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees that are authorized by contract or statute, the trial court \r\n  should make specific findings of fact on the record for each of these factors.Â  \r\n  See Jackson, 326 S.C. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760 (holding that, \r\n  â€œon appeal, an award for attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as sufficient \r\n  evidence in the record supports each factorâ€); Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., \r\n  310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1993) (holding that the â€œcourt should \r\n  make specific findings of fact on the record for each factorâ€). \r\nIn the present case, the trial court entered \r\n  specific findings for each of the required factors outlined in the case law. \r\n  Â These findings are sustained by the evidence in the record.Â  Thus, the \r\n  award is affirmed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court \r\n  properly found Drews liable for the illegal sale of an unregistered security \r\n  under the Securities Act, and that Drews failed to prove his entitlement to \r\n  the limited offering exemption under the Act.Â  Also, for the reasons stated \r\n  above, Drewsâ€™ other claims and defenses are without merit.Â  The trial courtâ€™s \r\n  rulings are therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Gordon brought this action on behalf of his mother, Dorothy Gordon.Â  \r\n    Gordon used his motherâ€™s funds to purchase the stocks in question and acted \r\n    at all times on her behalf.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  There have been no substantive changes to the \r\n    Uniform Securities Act since the underlying cause of action arose.Â  Accordingly, \r\n    we cite to the most current version of the Act.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Gordon was allowed to amend his complaint to conform with the evidence \r\n    at the conclusion of trial to include an action under both section 35-1-1490(1) \r\n    and (2).Â Â  In the final order, the trial court found Gordon was entitled to \r\n    recover from Drews for a violation of section 35-1-1490(1).Â Â  However, the \r\n    court went on to hold that Gordon could not prevail under subsection (2) because \r\n    Drews met his burden of showing he could not have known of the untruth of \r\n    his statements.Â  Accordingly, we evaluate the trial courtâ€™s order as applied \r\n    to subsection (1).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The Pinter Court limited its holding to Section 12(1) of the \r\n    Securities Act, codified at 15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 77l (1981), holding â€œthis \r\n    case does not present, nor do we take a position on, the scope of a statutory \r\n    seller for the purposes of [Section] 12(2).â€Â  Pinter, 486 U.S. at 642 \r\n    n.20, 108 S.Ct. at 2076 n.20, 100 L.Ed.2d at 679 n.20.Â  Although many state \r\n    courts, including South Carolina, have adopted the Pinter â€œfinancial \r\n    benefits testâ€ as applicable to their state statutes comparable to Section \r\n    12(2), some have refused to extend the definition of seller and have instead \r\n    adopted a â€œsubstantial factor test.â€Â  See, e.g., Hoffer v. \r\n    State, 776 P.2d 963, 964-65 (Wash. 1989) (refusing to extend the Pinter \r\n    test to subsection (2) of the state statute and maintaining the â€œsubstantial \r\n    factor testâ€ to evaluate that section as previously adopted by the court).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3776","title":"Boyd v.

Ness, of Bamberg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â  Caroline Boyd, on \r\n  behalf of herself and her antique business, The Caroline Collection, Inc., sued \r\n  BellSouth Telephone Telegraph Company, Inc., a/k/a BellSouth Telecommunications, \r\n  Inc., now known as BellSouth (â€œBellSouthâ€), seeking to establish an easement \r\n  over BellSouthâ€™s property.Â  Specifically, Boyd alleged she possessed an easement \r\n  by necessity, pre-existing use, or estoppel.Â  The special referee granted summary \r\n  judgment to BellSouth, concluding no easement arose under any view of the facts.Â  \r\n  Boyd appeals, arguing factual issues precluded summary judgment as to each cause \r\n  of action.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe two properties involved in this litigation \r\n  are located in the City of Denmark, South Carolina.Â  At one time, BellSouth \r\n  owned both properties under its predecessor name, AT&amp;T. As one parcel, the \r\n  property was bounded on three sides by public streets. \r\nIn 1923, AT&amp;T built a three-story building \r\n  to house offices and switching equipment on the front portion of the lot. Thereafter, \r\n  BellSouth constructed a concrete driveway running from the street at the back \r\n  of the property to double-doors at the back of the building.Â  These rear doors \r\n  lead to the basement of the building.Â  \r\nIn 1988, BellSouth severed the front lot, \r\n  selling it to the City of Denmark.Â  The City continued using the driveway to \r\n  access the rear of the building. Â Approximately three years after the original \r\n  severance, the City sold the lot and building to Boydâ€™s husband, who in turn \r\n  transferred it to Boyd to use as a retail antique store.Â  According to Boydâ€™s \r\n  husband, driveway access was a consideration in the decision to purchase the \r\n  property.Â  Boyd asserts her husband was acting on behalf of both himself and \r\n  Boyd in the purchase of the building, in a joint venture, to open the antique \r\n  business.\r\nFollowing the purchase, BellSouth gave \r\n  Boyd access to the driveway by allowing her to have a lock and key to the gate \r\n  located at the street fronting on BellSouthâ€™s property.Â  Boyd used this driveway \r\n  to accept deliveries from tractor-trailers carrying large furniture, such as \r\n  pianos, which she placed in the basement level of the antique store.Â  However, \r\n  after the terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, BellSouth \r\n  increased the security to its property, notifying Boyd it intended to place \r\n  a fence along her back property line separating Boydâ€™s property from BellSouthâ€™s \r\n  property, thereby cutting off access to the driveway.\r\nIn response, Boyd sued BellSouth, arguing the court \r\n  should grant her continued use of the driveway by virtue of an easement by necessity \r\n  and an easement by pre-existing use.Â  Furthermore, Boyd claimed BellSouth made \r\n  representations to her husband at the time he purchased the property, estopping \r\n  BellSouth from claiming no easement existed.Â Â  The case was referred to a special \r\n  referee.\r\nBellSouth moved for summary judgment on all of \r\n  Boydâ€™s causes of action.Â  The special referee concluded no questions of fact \r\n  existed and granted summary judgment.Â  Boyd appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nTo obtain summary judgment, the moving \r\n  party must demonstrate there is â€œno genuine issue of material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  In deciding \r\n  whether to grant summary judgment, trial courts must construe all ambiguities, \r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence against the moving party.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Alternatively stated, â€œif the pleadings and evidentiary matter in \r\n  support of summary judgment do not establish the absence of a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact, summary judgment must be denied . . . .â€ Baird v. Charleston \r\n  County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]n \r\n  appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard \r\n  applied by the trial court.â€Â  Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, \r\n  301, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Easement By Necessity\r\nBoyd argues the special referee erred by granting \r\n  summary judgment on her claim for easement by necessity.Â  We disagree.\r\nA party claiming to be benefited by an easement \r\n  by necessity must demonstrate the existence of the following three elements: \r\n  1) unity of title; 2) severance of the title; and 3) necessity of the easement. \r\n  Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 529, 492 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThe third element, that of necessity, requires \r\n  a showing of more than convenience. Morrow, 328 S.C. at 529, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  at 424.Â  The doctrine of easement by necessity is based upon the presumption \r\n  that the grantor intended the grantee of a landlocked parcel to have access \r\n  to his property, a right recognized as essential to the enjoyment of the land.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Thus,Â  â€œ[this] doctrine only provides reasonable access to the dominant \r\n  estate when there is none; it does not provide a means for ensuring a preferred \r\n  method of access to a particular portion of a tract when access to the tract \r\n  is otherwise available.â€ Id.  \r\nPublic streets border Boydâ€™s property.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we agree with the conclusion of the special referee that no easement by necessity \r\n  arises under the facts of this case.Â  Rather, under any view of the evidence, \r\n  Boyd has reasonable access to her property.Â  Accordingly, we hold the special \r\n  referee properly granted summary judgment.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Implied Easement by Pre-existing Use\r\nBoyd argues the special referee erred \r\n  by granting summary judgment on her claim for an implied easement by pre-existing \r\n  use.Â  We agree.\r\nAn easement by pre-existing use exists where:Â  \r\n  1) the dominant and servient tracts of land originated from a common grantor; \r\n  2) the use was in existence at the time the original grantor severed the tracts; \r\n  and 3) the use was apparent, continuous, and necessary for enjoyment of the \r\n  dominant tract.Â  Crosland v. Rogers, 32 S.C. 130, 133, 10 S.E. 874, 875 \r\n  (1889); see Slater v. Price, 96 S.C. 245, 255-56, 80 S.E. 372, \r\n  374 (1913) (holding the trial court did not err by charging the jury on the \r\n  law of easement by pre-existing use); 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses \r\n  Â§ 27 (1996) (â€œWhere, during the unity of title, an apparently permanent and \r\n  obvious servitude is imposed on one part of the estate in favor of another part, \r\n  which servitude is in use at the time of severance and is necessary for the \r\n  reasonable enjoyment of the other part, on a severance of the ownership a grant \r\n  of the right to continue such use arises by implication of law.â€); Russakoff \r\n  v. Scruggs, 400 S.E.2d 529, 532 (Va. 1991) (holding to establish an easement \r\n  by pre-existing use, one must demonstrate:Â  â€œ(1) the dominant and servient tracts \r\n  originated from a common grantor, (2) the use was in existence at the time of \r\n  the severance, and that (3) the use is apparent, continuous, and reasonably \r\n  necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant tract.â€); Ryerson Tower, Inc. \r\n  v. St. James Towers, Inc., 517 N.Y.S.2d 48, 49 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987) (â€œAn \r\n  implied easement arises when two adjacent parcels of land were previously held \r\n  in common title and an intent can be ascertained from the circumstances surrounding \r\n  the landâ€™s previous use and the conveyance that the holder of one parcel is \r\n  to have a right to pass through the other parcel, or to make some other such \r\n  limited use of it.â€); Underwood v. Shepard, 521 So.2d 1314, 1316 (Ala. \r\n  1988) (holding an easement by pre-existing use exists, where the following are \r\n  demonstrated:Â  1) unity of ownership; and 2) a use during that ownership that \r\n  was open, visible, continuous, and reasonably necessary to the estate granted); \r\n  see also Charles C. Marvel, Annotation, What Constitutes Unity of \r\n  Title or Ownership Sufficient for Creation of an Easement by Implication or \r\n  Way of Necessity, 94 A.L.R.3d 502 (1979) (â€œ[W]here, during the unity of \r\n  title, an apparently permanent and obvious servitude is imposed on one part \r\n  of an estate in favor of another part, which servitude is in use at the time \r\n  of severance and is necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the severed part, \r\n  a grant or reservation of the right to continue such use arises by implication \r\n  of law.â€).\r\nThe term necessary in the context means, â€œthere \r\n  could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement without \r\n  this easement . . . .â€ Crosland, 32 S.C. at 133, 10 S.E. at 875.\r\nIn a light most favorable to Boyd, the evidence \r\n  within the record indicates BellSouth was the common owner of the two properties.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, prior to the severance, BellSouth used Boydâ€™s building as a commercial \r\n  building, and the driveway in question was used to access the rear doors of \r\n  the building.Â  The use was present at the time of severance and apparent and \r\n  continuous during the period of common ownership.Â  Thus, the only remaining \r\n  inquiry is whether evidence exists within the record indicating use of the driveway \r\n  to access the rear doors was necessary for the enjoyment of Boydâ€™s property, \r\n  the dominant tract.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAccording to the affidavits and testimony presented \r\n  by Boyd, the building in question only has two entrances â€“ the front entrance \r\n  and the rear doors.Â  The evidence indicates that at the time BellSouth owned \r\n  the property, the front entrance was unsuitable for loading and unloading the \r\n  type of equipment owned by BellSouth.Â  The evidence also indicates the driveway \r\n  provided the only means of access to the rear doors, and the driveway was used \r\n  to access the rear doors for a period of at least fifty years. \r\nFurthermore, the evidence indicates for the brief \r\n  period the City owned the building, they used the rear doors as loading doors.Â  \r\n  Additionally, at the present time, the loading doors are the only reasonable \r\n  means of access for moving large items in and out of the building.Â  \r\nViewing this evidence in a light most favorable \r\n  to Boyd, we conclude a factual issue exists as to whether BellSouthâ€™s driveway \r\n  is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of Boydâ€™s property.Â  Thus, we hold \r\n  the special referee erred by granting summary judgment on this issue. \r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Estoppel\r\nBoyd argues the special referee erred by granting \r\n  summary judgment against her claim for easement by estoppel.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe doctrine of estoppel applies if a \r\n  person, by his actions, conduct, words or silence which amounts to a representation, \r\n  or a concealment of material facts causes another to alter his position to his \r\n  prejudice or injury.â€ Hubbard v. Beverly, 197 S.C. 476, 480, 15 S.E.2d \r\n  740, 741 (1941); see also Ott v. Ott, 182 S.C. 135, 140, 188 S.E. \r\n  789, 792 (1936) (â€œThe final element of an equitable estoppel is that the person \r\n  claiming it must have been misled into such action that he will suffer injury \r\n  if the estoppel is not declared. That is, the person setting up the estoppel \r\n  must have been induced to alter his position, in such a way that he will be \r\n  injured if the other person is not held to the representation or attitude on \r\n  which the estoppel is predicated.â€).Â  \r\nIn a light most favorable to Boyd, the evidence \r\n  within the record indicates that when Boydâ€™s husband was negotiating the purchase \r\n  of the front lot, he negotiated with BellSouth to purchase the rear lot, but \r\n  thought BellSouthâ€™s price of forty thousand dollars was too high.Â  He countered \r\n  at thirty-five thousand dollars, whereupon a BellSouth agent explained that \r\n  he did not need the property because he had access through the driveway to the \r\n  rear of the building located on the front lot.Â  According to Boydâ€™s husband, \r\n  the agent supplied him with a â€œplot plan,â€ showing the driveway running through \r\n  the BellSouth property to the building.Â  Relying on these representations, the \r\n  Boyds, acting as joint venturers, purchased the front lot to open an antique \r\n  buisness.Â  \r\nWe conclude this evidence is sufficient to establish \r\n  a claim for estoppel.Â  Thus, we hold the special referee erred by granting summary \r\n  judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the special \r\n  referee granting summary judgment on the cause of action to establish easement \r\n  by necessity is affirmed.Â  The grant of summary judgment on the causes of action \r\n  to establish an easement implied by pre-existing use and by estoppel is reversed, \r\n  and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and KITTREDGE, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3777","title":"State v.

Dudek, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor \r\n  Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: William Larry Childers, Jr. \r\n  was convicted of murder, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature \r\n  (ABHAN), and discharging a firearm into a dwelling.Â  The trial judge imposed \r\n  a sentence of life imprisonment for murder and concurrent terms of ten years \r\n  imprisonment each for ABHAN and discharging a firearm.Â  Childers appeals.Â  We \r\n  affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nChilders was estranged from the victim, \r\n    his former live-in girlfriend, at the time of the victimâ€™s death.Â  Though \r\n    the victim and her children were living with her mother, Childers testified \r\n    the couple was attempting to reconcile. \r\n    [1] Â  The victimâ€™s sister testified that on October 14, 2000, Childers \r\n    came to the house to visit the victim and return some CDs.Â  After the victim \r\n    refused to leave the house, the sister testified Childers â€œstarted getting \r\n    madâ€ and threw the CDs before he left.Â  The victimâ€™s sister further testified \r\n    that she, her ex-husband, and the victim saw Childers at a turkey shoot later \r\n    that night.Â \r\n  At approximately 3:00 a.m. the following morning, \r\n    October 15, 2000, the victimâ€™s brother testified he called the police because \r\n    he saw Childers outside of the house.Â  Police arrived at the scene but did \r\n    not find anyone in the vicinity.Â  The victimâ€™s brother testified that, shortly \r\n    after the police left, he heard gunshots and ran outside, where he â€œ[saw] \r\n    Larry Childers go across the yard.â€Â  \r\n  The victimâ€™s sister testified that she, her ex-husband, \r\n    and the victim returned to her motherâ€™s home from the turkey shoot in the \r\n    early morning hours of October 15th and stood in the yard talking.Â  The sister \r\n    testified that her ex-husband suddenly said he saw Childers with a gun right \r\n    before she heard gunshots.Â  Childers shot the victim twice, killing her.Â  \r\n    The sister testified Childers then shot at her once before he fired a shot \r\n    into the house.Â  The sisterâ€™s ex-husband corroborated her testimony.Â  \r\n  Childers testified to a different version of \r\n    the eveningâ€™s events.Â  Childers stated he and the victim had been involved \r\n    in a serious relationship and that they had only been estranged for eight \r\n    or nine days before the shooting.Â  Childers admitted that he saw the victim \r\n    at the turkey shoot, and he claimed that the victim indicated she was willing \r\n    to talk to him, but he wanted to talk to her privately, not at the turkey \r\n    shoot. After leaving the turkey shoot, Childers testified that he drove around \r\n    for a while before going to a friendâ€™s house that was near the home of the \r\n    victimâ€™s mother.Â  Childers walked to the motherâ€™s home because he wanted to \r\n    â€œtry to get [the victim] to come outside and talk to [him] a minute because \r\n    [they had] fussed, she had got mad with [him] earlier and [he] wanted to clear \r\n    that up.â€Â  Childers testified that he brought a loaded gun with him in case \r\n    he encountered stray dogs during his walk.Â  \r\n  Childers testified that when he arrived at the \r\n    house, he saw the victim, her sister, and her sisterâ€™s ex-husband in the yard.Â  \r\n    As he walked toward them, Childers testified that the ex-husband shot at him.Â  \r\n    Childers said he immediately fired back and ran away. \r\n  After the jury had been selected, the \r\n    public defender, who was aÂ  former assistant solicitor, informed the trial \r\n    judge that he had prosecuted Childers approximately ten years earlier and \r\n    that he had performed some legal work for the victimâ€™s brother approximately \r\n    six years before the trial.Â  Defense counsel informed the judge that Childers \r\n    did not â€œfeel comfortable at this point with my previous relationship with \r\n    the [S]tate and as a prosecutor against him.â€Â  Childers then told the judge, \r\n    â€œI want him [re]moved because he prosecuted me.â€Â  The trial judge declined \r\n    to relieve defense counsel, stating there was no â€œbuilt-in conflict,â€ as Childersâ€™ \r\n    prior trial was several years earlier and defense counsel did not remember \r\n    prosecuting him. The trial judge did not specifically address the fact that \r\n    defense counsel had previously done legal work for the victimâ€™s brother.\r\n  At the close of trial, defense counsel asked \r\n    for charges on self defense, involuntary manslaughter, and voluntary manslaughter. \r\n    The trial judge agreed to charge self defense and involuntary manslaughter, \r\n    but refused to charge voluntary manslaughter. The jury ultimately returned \r\n    with guilty verdicts on murder, ABHAN, and discharging a firearm into a dwelling, \r\n    and Childers received an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment.Â  Childers \r\n    appeals.Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Request to Relieve Defense Counsel \r\n    Childers argues the trial judge erred in refusing \r\n      his request to relieve defense counsel based on counselâ€™s prosecution of \r\n      him in the past and counselâ€™s previous representation of the victimâ€™s brother.Â  \r\n      We disagree.\r\n    â€œA motion to relieve counsel is addressed to \r\n      the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse \r\n      of discretion.â€Â  State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 385, 548 S.E.2d \r\n      210, 211 (2001) (citation omitted).Â  The mere possibility that defense counsel \r\n      may have a conflict of interest is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.Â  \r\n      See Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 359, 426 S.E.2d 793, \r\n      795 (1993) (citing Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980)).\r\n\r\n    A.Â Â Â Â Â  Defense counsel as former \r\n      prosecutor\r\n\r\n    When defense counsel revealed to the court \r\n      that he had successfully prosecuted Childers ten years earlier, he stated \r\n      that he had no independent recollection of the case.Â  In fact, he only learned \r\n      of the prosecution when the solicitor checked the files and revealed to \r\n      him that he was the assistant solicitor in charge of Childersâ€™ prior case.Â Â  \r\n    \r\n    While South Carolina courts have never addressed \r\n      whether an attorney who formally prosecuted the defendant can later serve \r\n      as appointed counsel for the defendant in a subsequent case, other jurisdictions \r\n      have addressed the issue.Â  In State v. Cobbs, 584 N.W.2d 709 (Wis. \r\n      Ct. App. 1998), defense counsel had previously prosecuted the defendant \r\n      when he was working in the district attorneyâ€™s office.Â  The Wisconsin Supreme \r\n      Court found there was no actual conflict of interest or serious potential \r\n      conflict of interest.Â  Id. at 711.Â  The court pointed out that â€œ[t]here \r\n      were no competing loyalties in this case,â€ nor was it â€œa situation where \r\n      defense counsel has appeared for and represented the State as a prosecutor \r\n      in prior proceedings involving the same case in which he or she currently \r\n      represents the defendant[.]â€Â  Id.Â  (Emphasis in original.) See \r\n      also People v. Nunez, 186 A.D.2d 764 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992) (finding \r\n      that even though defense counsel had formerly been a solicitor and even \r\n      though she had only visited defendant twice during his incarceration, the \r\n      trial court did not err in failing to substitute counsel because there was \r\n      no irreconcilable conflict of interest). Other jurisdictions have even found \r\n      no conflict despite defense counselâ€™s actual involvement in the prosecution \r\n      of the same case against his eventual client.Â  See e.g., State \r\n      v. King, 447 So.2d 395 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) (finding defendantâ€™s \r\n      counsel need not be disqualified in the revocation of probation case even \r\n      though he had been the prosecuting attorney for the underlying charges because \r\n      the alleged violation of probation was factually unrelated to the prior \r\n      offense and there was no actual prejudice shown); Brown v. State, \r\n      385 N.E.2d 1148 (Ind. 1979) (finding no abuse of discretion where trial \r\n      judge denied a mistrial motion that was made after it was discovered that \r\n      defense counsel, who was a previous prosecutor, had several informations \r\n      against the defendant).Â Â Â  \r\n    In this case, aside from the fact that defense \r\n      counsel had prosecuted Childers ten years earlier, there was no showing \r\n      of any competing loyalties or actual conflict.Â  See People v. \r\n      Abar, 786 N.E.2d 1255 (N.Y. 2003) (stating that there was no evidence \r\n      the public defender obtained information about defendant through her prior \r\n      employment as an assistant district attorney even though she had prosecuted \r\n      the defendant in the past).Â  When there is no actual conflict, the defendant \r\n      must demonstrate he was prejudiced by the attorneyâ€™s representation of him. \r\n      Cf. Thomas v. State, 346 S.C. 140, 145 n.2, 551 S.E.2d 254, \r\n      259 n.2 (2001) (â€œPetitioner does not have to demonstrate prejudice if there \r\n      is an actual conflict of interest.â€).Â  Here, there was no showing of prejudice.Â  \r\n      Defense counsel testified that he was ready and prepared to defend Childersâ€™ \r\n      case, and other than complaining that his attorney had not met with him \r\n      frequently enough prior to trial, Childers did not articulate any reason \r\n      he would be prejudiced by being represented by his former prosecutor.Â  Thus, \r\n      we find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to relieve defense counsel.\r\n\r\n    B.Â Â Â Â Â  Defense counselâ€™s representation \r\n      of witness\r\n\r\n    Childers also argues defense counsel should \r\n      have been relieved based on his past representation of the victimâ€™s brother.Â  \r\n      While defense counsel mentioned he had â€œpreviously done some workâ€ for the \r\n      brother approximately six years before Childersâ€™ trial, the trial judge \r\n      did not rule upon whether this prior representation was grounds for a conflict. \r\n      [2] Â  As such, this issue is not preserved for review by this court.Â  \r\n      See State v. Perez, 334 S.C. 563, 566-67, 514 S.E.2d 754, \r\n      755 (1999) (holding an issue must be both raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n      trial judge to be preserved for appellate review); see also State \r\n      v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 386, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211 (stating that it \r\n      was defendantâ€™s burden to show satisfactory cause for removing counsel).Â  \r\n    \r\n    II.Â Â Â Â Â  Jury Charge\r\n    Next, Childers argues the trial judge erred by \r\n      declining to charge the jury on the law of voluntary manslaughter.Â  We agree.\r\n    The evidence presented at trial determines \r\n      the charged jury instruction.Â  State v. Lee, 298 S.C. 362, 364, 380 \r\n      S.E.2d 834, 836 (1989).Â  â€œThe purpose of a jury instruction is to enlighten \r\n      the jury and to aid it in arriving at a correct verdict.â€Â  State v. Blurton, \r\n      352 S.C. 203, 207, 573 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002).Â  â€œWhen determining whether \r\n      a defendant is entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge, the court views \r\n      the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant.â€Â  State v. Grubbs, \r\n      353 S.C. 374, 381, 577 S.E.2d 493, 497 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n    â€œVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing \r\n      of a human being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.â€Â  \r\n      State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 360, 535 S.E.2d 420, 424 (2000).Â  \r\n      â€œTo warrant a courtâ€™s eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it should \r\n      very clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce \r\n      the crime from murder to manslaughter.â€Â  State v. Cole, 338 S.C. \r\n      97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000).\r\n    Here, there was evidence that Childers only \r\n      fired his gun after he was shot at by the victimâ€™s ex-brother-in-law.Â  In \r\n      State v. Penland, 275 S.C. 537, 540, 273 S.E.2d 765, 766 (1981), \r\n      our supreme court found that a voluntary manslaughter charge was warranted \r\n      â€œbased upon a statement given by appellant following the shooting, which \r\n      created a jury issue on provocation and heat of passion due to the evidence \r\n      of the pointing of the gun at the appellant and the subsequent struggle.â€Â  \r\n      Thus, if the pointing of a gun and subsequent struggle justifies a voluntary \r\n      manslaughter charge, so too would the pointing of a gun and subsequent firing \r\n      of that gun.Â  Although it was the victimâ€™s brother-in-law, and not the victim \r\n      herself, who allegedly shot at and thereby provoked Childers, the doctrine \r\n      of transferred intent justifies a voluntary manslaughter charge as to the \r\n      killing of the victim.Â  See State v. Gandy, 283 S.C. 571, \r\n      573, 324 S.E.2d 65, 67 (1984) implicitly overruled on other grounds by \r\n      Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991) (â€œWhere a defendant \r\n      intends to kill or seriously injure one person, but kills another, a defendant \r\n      may be found guilty of murder or manslaughter.â€)Â  Accordingly, Childersâ€™ \r\n      conviction for murder is reversed and remanded. \r\n     CONCLUSION\r\n       We find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n        refusal to relieve counsel; however, the trial judge did err by not charging \r\n        the jury on voluntary manslaughter.Â  Therefore Childersâ€™ convictions for \r\n        ABHAN and discharging a firearm into a dwelling are AFFIRMED, and \r\n        his conviction for murder is REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n       AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n      ANDERSON AND BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The victimâ€™s sister disputes this, testifying that the victim was \r\n    living with her mother until she could evict Childers from her home.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  At trial, Childers never requested defense counsel be relieved because \r\n    of counselâ€™s past legal representation of the victimâ€™s brother.

Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nGeoffrey H. Waggoner, Richard S. Rosen, and Alex&nbsp;B. Cash, \r\n  all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  This action was commenced \r\n  to recover damages sustained by Catherine L. Hitchcock in an accident caused \r\n  by a drunk driver.Â  Carol Hunting, as guardian ad litem for Hitchcock, brought \r\n  suit against Chris Gordon as the drunk driver, Elmyer Enterprises, Inc. as the \r\n  owner and operator of the bar, and William Elders as the alter ego of the corporation.Â  \r\n  In the first portion of the bifurcated trial, damages of $1.5 million were awarded \r\n  against Gordon and Elmyer Enterprises. Â The second phase of the trial, \r\n  which is the subject of this appeal, resulted in a holding that Elders was the \r\n  alter ego of Elmyer Enterprises, justifying piercing the corporate veil, thereby \r\n  holding Elders personally liable for the $1.5 million verdict and the interest \r\n  which had accrued from the date of the original judgment against the corporation.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWe discern the following facts from the order of \r\n  the unappealed first phase of the trial.Â  Gordon became intoxicated while at \r\n  Willieâ€™s, a bar operated by Elmyer Enterprises.Â  Gordon was served alcohol despite \r\n  being obviously intoxicated.Â  After leaving the bar in an intoxicated state, \r\n  he caused the accident in which Hitchcock was left permanently brain damaged.Â  \r\n  Hunting was awarded $1.5 million in actual damages against Gordon and Elmyer \r\n  Enterprises.Â  The jury also awarded $3,000 and $25,000 in punitive damages against \r\n  Gordon and Elmyer Enterprises respectively.Â  Subsequently, a non-jury trial \r\n  was held on the issue of whether to pierce the corporate veil of Elmyer Enterprises \r\n  and hold Elders liable for the judgment as its alter ego.Â  \r\nThe facts as gleaned from the second trial reveal that Elmyer \r\n  Enterprises was originally incorporated in 1981 and engaged in the business \r\n  of selling tires.Â  Elders and another shareholder operated the business until \r\n  Elders bought out the other shareholder.Â  The business then became inactive \r\n  for several years.Â  \r\nIn 1990, Elders opened two bars on property \r\n  he owned.Â  He originally held the liquor licenses in his own name.Â  In 1993, \r\n  he reinstated Elmyer Enterprises for the purpose of operating the bars.Â  Each \r\n  bar was capitalized with $1,000, which was deposited into separate bank accounts.Â  \r\n  The property and equipment used to operate the bars were leased to Elmyer Enterprises \r\n  by other businesses formed and owned by Elders.Â  Both bars operated video poker \r\n  machines, which were leased from yet another of Eldersâ€™ business corporations.Â  \r\n  That particular enterprise owned many more machines than were present in the \r\n  bars belonging to Elmyer Enterprises.Â  \r\nIn December 1993, Elders transferred several \r\n  shares of stock in Elmyer Enterprises to his wife and niece.Â  He designated \r\n  his wife as a vice president and his niece as secretary and treasurer.Â  However, \r\n  his niece testified that she knew nothing about her ownership of shares of stock \r\n  of Elmyer Enterprises or her selection as an officer of the company.Â  Minutes \r\n  were recorded that detailed the selections and the stock transfers.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, Hunting presented the \r\n  testimony of Jan Waring-Woods, a forensic accountant, who testified money was \r\n  siphoned from the corporation for Eldersâ€™ personal use.Â  She testified many \r\n  records needed for an accurate audit of the corporation were either not created \r\n  or not made available at the time of trial.Â  After reviewing the corporate tax \r\n  returns for the various companies Elders owned, as well as some of the records \r\n  she managed to locate regarding the income of the business, she testified Elders \r\n  siphoned off between $400,000 and $800,000 from the business over a three-year \r\n  period.Â  Additionally, she testified some of Eldersâ€™ personal tax forms were \r\n  altered prior to trial to eliminate information about dividend income from investment \r\n  accounts Elders held during the time he ran the business.Â  \r\nHunting also presented testimony from \r\n  John Freeman, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.Â  He testified \r\n  that in his opinion the company was operated as a facade by Elders. Â Freeman \r\n  maintained Elmyer Enterprises was grossly undercapitalized given its purpose \r\n  of operating bars and considering the inherent risks associated with a business \r\n  dispensing alcohol.Â  His conclusion was that Elmyer Enterprises had income that \r\n  was unaccounted for and profit that was not adequately revealed.Â  He further \r\n  testified that, in his opinion, Elders was the alter ego of Elmyer Enterprises. \r\n  Â \r\nElders testified the income was as reported.Â  \r\n  He claimed detailed records were never kept by the company.Â  He noted that any \r\n  discrepancies in the records were the result of the way in which the bar was \r\n  managed.Â  He also argued the business was run as a statutory close corporation \r\n  and as an S corporation.Â  Therefore, it did not have to meet the normal business \r\n  formalities and would likely mirror Elders as the majority shareholder.Â  Elders \r\n  claimed the business met its ongoing financial obligations and therefore was \r\n  not undercapitalized.Â  \r\nThe trial court found Eldersâ€™ testimony \r\n  was not credible, and the evidence presented at trial clearly indicated Elmyer \r\n  Enterprises was operated as a mere facade for Elders.Â  Thus, the court concluded \r\n  Hunting met the burden of proof in establishing the factors necessary to pierce \r\n  the corporate veil and hold Elders personally liable for the judgment originally \r\n  awarded against Elmyer Enterprises.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to pierce the corporate veil \r\n  lies in equity, and therefore, this court may determine the facts according \r\n  to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  See C.T. Lowndes \r\n  &amp; Co. v. Suburban Gas &amp; Appliance Co., 307 S.C. 394, 396, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  404, 405 (Ct. App. 1991); Sturkie v. Sifly, 280 S.C. 453, 456-57, 313 \r\n  S.E.2d 316, 318 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The broad scope of review applicable to appeals \r\n  in equity actions does not, however, require an appellate court to disregard \r\n  the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better \r\n  position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, \r\n  344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nElders contends the trial court erred in piercing \r\n  the corporate veil of Elmyer Enterprises and therefore holding him personally \r\n  liable for the judgment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œAt the outset, it is recognized that a corporation \r\n  is an entity, separate and distinct from its officers and stockholders, and \r\n  that its debts are not the individual indebtedness of its stockholders.â€Â  DeWitt \r\n  Truck Brokers, Inc. v. W. Ray Flemming Fruit Co., 540 F.2d 681, 683 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1976).Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has ruled that the corporate entity \r\n  may be disregarded in certain situations.Â  See Baker v. Equitable \r\n  Leasing Corp., 275 S.C. 359, 271 S.E.2d 596 (1980).Â  â€œHowever, â€˜piercing \r\n  the corporate veilâ€™ is not a doctrine to be applied without substantial reflection.â€Â  \r\n  Baker, 275 S.C. at 367, 271 S.E.2d at 600.Â  â€œThe corporate form may be \r\n  disregarded only where equity requires the action to assist a third party.â€Â  \r\n  Woodside v. Woodside, 290 S.C. 366, 370, 350 S.E.2d 407, 410 (Ct. App. \r\n  1986).Â  The party asserting the corporate veil should be pierced has the burden \r\n  of proof.Â  Id.\r\nGenerally, courts are reluctant to â€œdisregard the integrity \r\n  of the corporate entity.â€Â  Sturkie, 280 S.C. at 459, 313 S.E.2d at 319.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf any general rule can be laid down, it is that a corporation \r\n  will be looked upon as a legal entity until sufficient reason to the contrary \r\n  appears; but when the notion of legal entity is used to protect fraud, justify \r\n  wrong, or defeat public policy, the law will regard the corporation as an association \r\n  of persons.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 457, 313 S.E.2d at 318.\r\nIn Sturkie, this court set forth \r\n  a two-pronged test to be used to determine whether to pierce the corporate veil.Â  \r\n  â€œThe first part of the test, an eight-factor analysis, looks to observance of \r\n  the corporate formalities by the dominant shareholders.Â  The second part requires \r\n  that there be an element of injustice or fundamental unfairness if the acts \r\n  of the corporation be not regarded as the acts of the individuals.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 457-58, 313 S.E.2d at 318.Â  The first eight factors were delineated in Dumas \r\n  v. InfoSafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 463 S.E.2d 641 (Ct. App. 1995):\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)\r\n        &nbsp;whether the corporation was grossly undercapitalized;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;\r\n         failure to observe corporate formalities;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)&nbsp;\r\n         non-payment of dividends;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (4)\r\n         insolvency of the debtor corporation \r\n  at the time;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (5)\r\n         siphoning of funds of the corporation by the dominant \r\n  stockholder;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         non-functioning of other officers \r\n  or other directors;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         absence of corporate records;Â  and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (8)\r\n        &nbsp;the fact that the corporation was merely a facade \r\n  for the operations of the dominant stockholder.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDumas, 320 S.C. at 192, 463 S.E.2d at 644.Â \r\nâ€œThe conclusion to disregard the corporate entity must involve a number of the \r\n  eight factors, but need not involve them all.â€Â  Id. (citing Cumberland \r\n  Wood Prods. v. Bennett, 308 S.C. 268, 417 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  \r\n  There is a second prong contained in Sturkie, but it need not be reached \r\n  until and unless the requirements of the first prong are met.Â  \r\nNeither Sturkie nor any other case \r\n  cited by the parties has set forth the weight that must be accorded to each \r\n  of the eight factors, nor has any case required that each factor be accorded \r\n  equal weight with the others.Â  Additionally, in applying the eight-factor test \r\n  of the first prong set out in Sturkie, significant changes in basic South \r\n  Carolina corporate law and federal and state tax law have somewhat complicated \r\n  the analysis.Â  The ability under state corporate law to adopt and operate under \r\n  a statutory close corporation status has, as a practical matter, diminished \r\n  the importance of several of the eight factors.Â  In the same fashion, the ability \r\n  of corporations to avoid double taxation by adopting S corporation status under \r\n  federal income tax law has lessened the importance of applying the factor concerning \r\n  the nonpayment of dividends.Â  \r\nThe Sturkie factors which now have \r\n  less importance include the failure to observe corporate formalities, nonfunctioning \r\n  of other officers or other directors, the absence of corporate records and, \r\n  as stated above, the nonpayment of dividends.Â  The adoption of the statutory \r\n  device allowing the creation of a statutory close corporation was designed to \r\n  lessen the formalities necessary to maintain a corporation.Â  A statutory close \r\n  corporation may operate without a board of directors, \r\n  [1]  need not adopt bylaws under certain circumstances, \r\n  [2]  and need not hold an annual meeting unless pursuant to a shareholder \r\n  request. [3] Â  The failure to \r\n  observe the formality â€œis not a ground for imposing personal liability on the \r\n  shareholders for liabilities of the corporation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-18-250 \r\n  (1990).Â  Indeed, the official comment to section 33-18-250 notes â€œthe purpose \r\n  of this section is to eliminate the possible argument that the shareholders \r\n  in a statutory close corporation are individually liable for the debts and torts \r\n  of the business because the corporation did not follow the classical model of \r\n  a corporation.â€Â  The comment continues:\r\n\r\nThis section does not prevent a court from â€œpiercing the \r\n  corporate veilâ€ of a statutory close corporation if the circumstances should \r\n  justify imposing personal liability on the shareholders were the corporation \r\n  not a statutory close corporation.Â  It merely prevents a court from â€œpiercing \r\n  the corporate veilâ€ because it is a statutory close corporation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-18-250 cmt. (1990).Â  \r\nThe advent of the statutory close corporation has \r\n  also had an impact on the type and extent of corporate records required to be \r\n  maintained and the number and duties of corporate officers and directors.Â  Elders \r\n  asserts he maintained all necessary corporate records and there were always \r\n  officers of the corporation.Â  \r\nAlthough Elders maintained a bare minimum of corporate \r\n  records, normal business records were definitely lacking in sufficiency.Â  The \r\n  corporation did not have adequate records of income from the video poker machines \r\n  or from the operation of the bars.Â  It did not have records of cash receipts, \r\n  cash expenses, sales, inventory, or other profit and loss statements that normally \r\n  would be expected.Â  \r\nIn the same fashion, although the corporate minutes \r\n  indicated the election of officers, Eldersâ€™ niece, who served as secretary-treasurer, \r\n  stated she did not know she was an officer in the corporation.Â  Elders produced \r\n  minutes indicating that his wife and niece were present during meetings.Â  However, \r\n  the niece testified she never attended any corporate meetings. \r\nAdmittedly, Elmyer Enterprises was not required \r\n  to follow the same corporate formalities as a regular business corporation.Â  \r\n  Although the failure to adhere to these formalities alone cannot be used to \r\n  pierce the corporate veil, coupling the dearth of corporate business records \r\n  and the inactivity of other corporate officers with the evidence of substantial \r\n  siphoning of funds provides evidence upon which the trial court, at least in \r\n  part, based its decision.\r\nAs to the factor concerning the payment or nonpayment of \r\n  dividends, its importance in the overall scheme of things has been diminished \r\n  by the election now allowed by federal tax law.Â  Elders asserts that because \r\n  the corporation elected to operate as an S corporation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§Â§ 1361-1399 (2002), the failure to pay dividends should not be considered a \r\n  factor against it in determining whether to pierce the corporate veil.Â  We agree, \r\n  because the net income of the corporation would be passed to the shareholders \r\n  in direct proportion to their ownership percentage.Â  However, at the same time, \r\n  this lessens the importance of this factor.Â  \r\nThe corporation was originally funded with only \r\n  $2,000, which represented $1,000 for each of the two operating locations.Â  Elders \r\n  asserts that the corporation was properly capitalized at all times, even though \r\n  the capitalization never appeared to increase over time.Â  \r\nâ€œOne fact which all the authorities consider significant \r\n  in the inquiry, and particularly so in the case of the one-man or closely-held \r\n  corporation, is whether the corporation was grossly undercapitalized for the \r\n  purposes of the corporate undertaking.â€Â  See Dewitt, 540 F.2d \r\n  at 685.Â  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals continued:Â  â€œ(t)he obligation to \r\n  provide adequate capital begins with incorporation and is a continuing obligation \r\n  thereafter * * * during the corporationâ€™s operations.â€Â  Id. (quoting \r\n  Gillespie, The Thin Corporate Line: Loss of Limited Liability Protection, \r\n  45 N.D. L. Rev. 363, 377-8 (1969)).Â  â€œAn obvious inadequacy of capital, measured \r\n  by the nature and magnitude of the corporate undertaking, has frequently been \r\n  an important factor in cases denying stockholders their defense of limited liability.â€Â  \r\n  Anderson v. Abbott, 321 U.S. 349, 362 (1944).\r\nThe corporationâ€™s initial funding was \r\n  minimal at best.Â  However, as an ongoing concern, the corporation was not properly \r\n  capitalized.Â  The corporation appeared to have a sufficient cash flow from the \r\n  bar as well as the video poker machines to continue experiencing growth throughout \r\n  the life of the corporation.Â  However, no evidence was produced showing that \r\n  that growth was ever reflected in the corporationâ€™s capital account.Â  \r\nAdditionally, as Professor Freeman testified, \r\n  a corporation established for the purpose of serving alcohol has more inherent \r\n  risks and should be adequately protected from liability associated with those \r\n  risks.Â  The failure to properly protect the business and others should be considered \r\n  when determining whether the corporation is properly capitalized.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we hold Elmyer Enterprises failed to remain properly capitalized as an ongoing \r\n  business.\r\nThe factors dealing with undercapitalization, siphoning \r\n  of funds, and whether the corporation was a facade for its dominant shareholder \r\n  are closely related.Â  The trial court found Elders siphoned substantial funds \r\n  from the corporation, and the evidence substantiates this finding.Â  Using documents \r\n  from the corporation, the forensic accountant testified there was a significant \r\n  amount of income not reported, and she determined that Elders siphoned $400,000 \r\n  to $800,000 from Elmyer Enterprises over a three-year period. Â Even though \r\n  the corporation was able to pay its debts and thereby escape the classical definition \r\n  of insolvency, the evidence indicates that Elders left in the till only so much \r\n  as was necessary to pay basic expenses.Â  \r\nThe trial court found Elders lacked credibility \r\n  in his explanations for the difference in the income and what was reported.Â  \r\n  The court specifically found the money was never accounted for and must have \r\n  been siphoned by Elders.Â  This is additional evidence that the corporation was \r\n  used as a mere facade for the benefit of the dominant shareholder, justifying \r\n  the ultimate conclusion reached by the trial court.\r\nWe therefore agree with the trial court that a \r\n  sufficient number of the eight Sturkie factors were present to justify \r\n  moving to the second prong of the analysis.Â  \r\nThe second prong of the Sturkie test, requiring \r\n  â€œthat there be an element of injustice or fundamental unfairness if the acts \r\n  of the corporation be not regarded as the acts of the individuals,â€Â  Sturkie, \r\n  280 S.C. at 457-458, 313 S.E.2d at 318, is perhaps more elusive.Â  In Sturkie, \r\n  the court stated:Â  \r\n\r\nThe burden of proving fundamental unfairness requires that \r\n  the plaintiff establish (1) that the defendant was aware of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  claim against the corporation, and (2) thereafter, the defendant acted in a \r\n  self-serving manner with regard to the property of the corporation and in disregard \r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s claim in the property.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 459, 313 S.E.2d at 319.Â  Later cases \r\n  clarified the actual knowledge requirement by stating that a person is â€œawareâ€ \r\n  of a claim against the corporation if he has notice of facts which, if pursued \r\n  with due diligence, would lead to knowledge of the claim.Â  Multimedia Publâ€™g \r\n  of South Carolina, Inc. v. Mullins, 314 S.C. 551, 554, 431 S.E.2d 569, 572 \r\n  (1993).Â  Most recently this court has held that â€œthe essence of the fairness \r\n  test is simply that an individual businessman cannot be allowed to hide from \r\n  the normal consequences of carefree entrepreneuring by doing so through a corporate \r\n  shell.â€Â  Dumas, 320 S.C. at 193, 436 S.E.2d at 644.Â  \r\nThere is evidence that indicates Elders \r\n  knew of the plaintiffâ€™s claim against the corporation and that, as the trial \r\n  court found, he nevertheless acted in a self-serving and unfair manner by siphoning \r\n  off substantial sums of money, commingling and transferring assets which he \r\n  held in his own name to different entities, transferring stock in the corporation \r\n  to other individuals without a valuable consideration, and then finally dissolving \r\n  the corporation.Â  \r\nElders submits there is no evidence he \r\n  intended to avoid the normal consequences of his entrepreneurial adventures.Â  \r\n  However, the â€œnormalâ€ consequences of operating a bar which, at least in this \r\n  instance, admittedly served alcohol to an already-intoxicated individual, transcends \r\n  that which would be considered normal consequences for the average entrepreneurial \r\n  endeavor.\r\nFinally, Elders submits that even if the \r\n  corporate veil of Elmyer is pierced and he is held individually liable, he should \r\n  not be responsible for the interest that has so far accrued on the debt against \r\n  the corporation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (Supp. 2003) states \r\n  that money decrees and judgments of courts enrolled or entered shall draw interest.Â  \r\n  â€œ[A] claimant is entitled to interest from the date of the rendition of the \r\n  verdict, or post-judgment interest, as a matter of course.â€Â  Calhoun v.

Â§ 15-39-30 (Supp. 2003), once commenced, is absolute and not subject \r\n  to tolling.Â  Such a judgment is â€œutterly extinguishedâ€ ten years from the date \r\n  of its entry.\r\nFACTS\r\nHome Port obtained a judgment against \r\n  Moore on March 20, 1989, in the United States District Court of South Carolina.Â  \r\n  During portions of the ten-year period following entry of the March 20, 1989 \r\n  judgment, Home Port undertook efforts to locate Moore.Â  These sporadic efforts \r\n  were unsuccessful until Moore was located in Bossier City, Louisiana, in January \r\n  of 1999. Home Port then filed an action on March 17, 1999 to register the judgment \r\n  in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.Â  \r\n  Home Port filed the present declaratory action in the circuit court on July \r\n  14, 2000, seeking a determination of its ability to enforce the judgment in \r\n  South Carolina after the expiration of the ten-year statutory enforcement period.Â Â Â  \r\n  Moore answered, asserting the judgment was no longer valid as the ten-year enforcement \r\n  period had expired.Â  \r\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary \r\n  judgment, claiming the only issue for the court to decide was whether the ten-year \r\n  enforcement period was tolled while Moore was absent from South Carolina.Â  The \r\n  circuit court granted Mooreâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding the ten-year \r\n  time for enforcement was absolute and not tolled during the period ofÂ  Mooreâ€™s \r\n  absence from South Carolina.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHome Port asserts the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to Moore.Â  Home Port argues that while S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-39-30 places a ten-year statute of limitations on the execution of \r\n  a judgment, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-30 (Supp. 2003) should operate to toll the \r\n  expiration of the enforcement period.Â  We disagree and find summary judgment \r\n  was warranted as the judgment was extinguished ten years from March 20, 1989, \r\n  the date of its entry.\r\nWe begin our analysis with the March 20, 1989 judgment \r\n  that Home Port obtained against Moore in the United States District Court for \r\n  the District of South Carolina.Â  South Carolina has adopted the Uniform Enforcement \r\n  of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA), which is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-900 \r\n  et seq. (1976).Â  Pursuant to section 15-35-910(1), a â€œâ€˜[f]oreign \r\n  [j]udgmentâ€™ means a judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States \r\n  . . . which is entitled to full faith and credit . . . .â€Â  The 1989 federal \r\n  court judgment is a â€œforeign judgment.â€Â  UEFJA is consistent with the federal \r\n  statute governing enforcement of judgments rendered in federal courts.Â  28 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1962 provides in part:\r\n\r\nEvery judgment rendered by a district court within a State \r\n  shall be a lien on the property located in such State in the same manner, \r\n  to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of \r\n  general jurisdiction in such State, and shall cease to be a lien in the same \r\n  manner and time.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nFederal law thus incorporates the law of the applicable State \r\n  in determining the effective date of the judgment lien, as well as its expiration.Â  \r\n  In this regard, Home Port acknowledges that a â€œjudgment creditor . . . [has] \r\n  ten years from entry of a â€˜foreign judgmentâ€™ of a United States District Court \r\n  of South Carolina to enroll such judgment in a South Carolina county . . . . \r\n  Thus, the judgment in question is in practical effect a South Carolina judgment, \r\n  even though it is, paradoxically, a â€˜foreign judgmentâ€™ under UEFJA.â€Â  In essence, \r\n  as mandated by federal law, the judgment rendered in the United States District \r\n  Court for the District of South Carolina on March 20, 1989 became a South Carolina \r\n  judgment for enforcement purposes on the same date.Â  We must therefore resort \r\n  to South Carolina law, section 15-39-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003), \r\n  to determine the extent, if any, of Home Portâ€™s continuing right to execute \r\n  on this judgment in South Carolina. \r\n  [1] Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œA judgment represents a judicial declaration that \r\n  a judgment debtor is personally indebted to a judgment creditor for a sum of \r\n  money.â€Â  Wells v. Sutton, 299 S.C. 19, 22, 382 S.E.2d 14, 16 (Ct. App. \r\n  1989) (citing Ducker v. Standard Supply Co., Inc., 280 S.C. 157, 311 \r\n  S.E.2d 728 (1984)).Â Â  Pursuant to section 15-39-30:\r\n\r\nExecutions may issue upon final judgments or decrees at any \r\n  time within ten years from the date of the original entry thereof and shall \r\n  have active energy during such period, without any renewal or renewals thereof, \r\n  and this whether any return may or may not have been made during such period \r\n  on such executions.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has concluded \r\n  that a judgment is â€œutterly extinguish[ed] . . . after the expiration of ten \r\n  years from the date of entry.â€Â  Hardee v. Lynch, 212 S.C. 6, 17, 46 S.E.2d \r\n  179, 183 (1948); see also Garrison v. Owens, 258 S.C. 442, 446-47, \r\n  189 S.E.2d 31, 33 (1972) (stating that â€œ[a] judgment lien is purely statutory[;] \r\n  its duration as fixed by the legislature may not be prolonged by the courts \r\n  and the bringing of an action to enforce the lien will not preserve it beyond \r\n  the time fixed by the statute, if such time expires before the action is tried.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nIn Wells, 299 S.C. at 22, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  at 16, this court stated:\r\n\r\nExecutions may be issued within ten years from the date of \r\n  the original entry of the judgment.Â  â€œThe execution is [the] only process to \r\n  enforce the judgment, and it cannot have active energy unless the underlying \r\n  judgment has a lien.â€Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has indicated a judgment \r\n  is utterly extinguished after the expiration of ten years from the date of entry.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n(citations omitted).Â  In its conclusion, this court \r\n  held:\r\n\r\n[T]his court emphasizes it does not condone efforts by judgment \r\n  debtors to secrete assets to avoid payment of judgments . . . . The reason for \r\n  our holding is simply our recognition of the public policy of this State as \r\n  expressed in the statutes to limit the life of judgments to ten years.Â  A judgment \r\n  creditor should recognize this policy and proceed expeditiously to conclude \r\n  his efforts to collect his judgment within the ten year period.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nHome Port contends the enforcement period \r\n  should be tolled at some undefined point prior to its expiration while Moore \r\n  was absent from South Carolina.Â  According to Home Port, section 15-3-30 provides \r\n  for tolling here.Â  Specifically, section 15-3-30 provides as follows:\r\n\r\nIf when a cause of action shall accrue against any person \r\n  he shall be out of the State, such action may be commenced within the terms \r\n  in this chapter respectively limited after the return of such person into this \r\n  State.Â  And if, after such cause of action shall have accrued, such person shall \r\n  depart from and reside out of this State or remain continuously absent therefrom \r\n  for the space of one year or more, the time of his absence shall not be deemed \r\n  or taken as any part of the time limited for the commencement of such action.\r\n\r\nHome Port cites Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. \r\n  v. Riddle, 334 S.C. 176, 512 S.E.2d 123 (Ct. App. 1999), arguing it establishes \r\n  that the ten-year enforcement period may be interrupted and tolled if a party \r\n  can demonstrate that the judgment debtor was out of the state and unavailable.Â  \r\n  We reject Home Portâ€™s reading of Commercial Credit.Â  Commercial Credit \r\n  obtained a default judgment in Illinois on May 27, 1986 and subsequently brought \r\n  an action in South Carolina to domesticate the foreign judgment.Â  The judgment \r\n  was enrolled in the Book of Abstracts for Newberry County on February 21, 1989.Â  \r\n  The dispute in Commercial Credit focused on determining the commencement \r\n  date of the enforcement period in South Carolina in accordance with section \r\n  15-39-30.Â  In the trial court, the special referee found the commencement of \r\n  the South Carolina enforcement period related back to the date of entry of the \r\n  judgment in Illinois, a position which this court rejected:\r\n\r\nOur state courts have held that a judgment is extinguished \r\n  ten years from the date of entry.Â  The institution of an action to domesticate \r\n  a foreign judgment specifically contemplates that a South Carolina judgment \r\n  will be issued by a South Carolina court.Â  At that point, pursuant to section \r\n  15-35-810, this South Carolina judgment may then be abstracted and indexed so \r\n  as to constitute a lien upon the debtorâ€™s real property for a period of ten \r\n  years.Â  It logically follows that section 15-39-30 also deals with the date \r\n  of original entry of the South Carolina judgment which may then be executed \r\n  upon for a period of ten years.Â  In the context of this case, the Illinois judgment \r\n  was transmuted into a South Carolina judgment when it was domesticated and the \r\n  judgment duly enrolled on February 21, 1989.Â  Thus, both the ten year lien period \r\n  on real estate, and the ten year period for enforcement of the judgment began \r\n  on that date.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 181-82, 512 S.E.2d at 126.Â  (citations \r\n  and footnote omitted).Â  \r\nHere, pursuant to the mandate of 28 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1962, the commencement of the ten-year enforcement period in South Carolina \r\n  is indisputably March 20, 1989.Â  Moreover, contrary to Home Portâ€™s assertion, \r\n  Commercial Credit does not hold that the enforcement period under section \r\n  15-39-30 may be tolled after it begins.Â  Indeed, Commercial Credit recognizes \r\n  â€œthe policy of this state to limit the life of a judgment to ten yearsâ€ and \r\n  further asserts the ten-year â€œenforcement period cannot be tolled.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 185, 183, 512 S.E.2d at 128, 127.  \r\n  [2] \r\nHome Port additionally cites a number \r\n  of cases which allow the tolling of a statute of limitations under a variety \r\n  of circumstances involving the application of the discovery rule \r\n  [3]  to a potential cause of action, but none applies the discovery rule \r\n  to delay or interrupt the running of the ten-year enforcement period in section \r\n  15-39-30 after entry of the judgment in South Carolina.Â  The public policy in \r\n  favor of extinguishment as set forth in Wells is much stronger than a \r\n  policy allowing the tolling of the enforcement period once it commences.Â  The \r\n  burden lies with the judgment creditor to know the policy of South Carolina \r\n  and to ensure collection on the judgment.Â  Wells, 299 S.C. at 22, 382 \r\n  S.E.2d at 16.Â  The application of the discovery rule to â€œcauses of actionâ€ prejudgment \r\n  simply does not have the same efficacy postjudgment after the section 15-39-30 \r\n  statutory enforcement period has commenced. [4]   \r\n CONCLUSION\r\nWe find, as many courts of this State before us, \r\n  that a judgment is â€œutterly extinguishedâ€ ten years from the date of its entry \r\n  and the ten-year enforcement period cannot be tolled.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Garrison, 258 S.C. at 446-47, 189 S.E.2d at 33.Â  Such a holding honors \r\n  the clear legislative intent in section 15-39-30 precluding â€œany renewalâ€ beyond \r\n  the ten-year period of â€œactive energy.â€Â  Accordingly, since Home Portâ€™s judgment \r\n  was extinguished in South Carolina on March 20, 1999, the judgment of the circuit \r\n  court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HOWARD, J. concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The judgment has been registered in the United States District \r\n    Court for the Western District of Louisiana.Â  Moore unsuccessfully challenged \r\n    the entry and enforceability of the judgment in that court, including an appeal \r\n    to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.Â  Home Port \r\n    Rentals, Inc. v. The Intâ€™l Yachting Group, Inc., 252 F.3d 399 (5th Cir. \r\n    2001).Â  For purposes of the case before us, we note the partiesâ€™ position \r\n    in the Louisiana litigation.Â  Specifically, Home Port filed the enforcement \r\n    action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana \r\n    on March 17, 1999, â€œthree days shy of the [judgmentâ€™s] tenth anniversary.â€Â  \r\n    Id. at 402.Â Â  The federal appeals court recognized that on March 17, \r\n    1999, the judgment was still â€œliveâ€ under South Carolina law.Â  Id. \r\n    at 403.Â  This finding is consistent with the applicability of section 15-39-30 \r\n    to the judgment rendered in the federal district court in South Carolina.Â  \r\n    Our application of the ten-year enforcement period in section 15-39-30 to \r\n    this foreign judgment reflects the interplay between UEFJA, 28 U.S.C.A. Â§ \r\n    1962 and applicable State law.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Commercial Credit was decided prior to South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n    adoption of UEFJA.Â  UEFJA, however, does not alter the courtâ€™s analysis or \r\n    result in Commercial Credit.Â  Since Home Portâ€™s underlying foreign \r\n    judgment originated in a federal district court in South Carolina, 28 U.S.C.A. \r\n    Â§ 1962 requires a finding that the South Carolina enforcement period began \r\n    on March 20, 1989, the date the federal court judgment was rendered in South \r\n    Carolina.Â  As Home Port candidly acknowledges, its federal court judgment \r\n    â€œis in practical effect a South Carolina judgment.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Under the discovery rule, â€œthe statute \r\n    of limitations begins to run from the date the injured party either knows \r\n    or should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action \r\n    exists for the wrongful conduct.â€Â Â Â  True v. Monteith, 327 S.C. 116, \r\n    119, 489 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1997).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Home Port submitted an affidavit detailing various attempts \r\n    to locate Moore.Â  Close scrutiny of this affidavit reveals that Home Port \r\n    made little or no effort to locate Moore from 1993 through 1998.Â  In light \r\n    of our holding that tolling is not available to extend the ten-year enforcement \r\n    period, we need not determine the nature of Home Portâ€™s diligence throughout \r\n    the ten-year period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3780","title":"Pope v.

[1] Â  The \r\n  State appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order returning property to Willie Edward \r\n  Gordon, Jr. (â€œGordonâ€).Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n  [2] \r\nFACTS\r\nThis forfeiture action arose from the arrest of \r\n  Gordon in September of 1996 for trafficking in crack cocaine.Â Â  At the time \r\n  of his arrest, Gordon was the owner of Gordonâ€™s Car Cleaning Service, an unincorporated \r\n  business whose principal venture was the cleaning and detailing of automobiles \r\n  for car dealerships and individuals. \r\nPrecipitating Gordonâ€™s 1996 arrest was an investigation \r\n  by agents with the Rock Hill Police Department (â€œDepartmentâ€).Â  In the early \r\n  part of 1994, agents received information from confidential informants that \r\n  Gordon was involved in selling crack cocaine.Â  Acting on its suspicions, the \r\n  Department conducted a controlled buy of illegal drugs from Gordon on January \r\n  27, 1994.Â  As a result, the Department obtained a search warrant on February \r\n  3, 1994, for Gordonâ€™s home and recovered crack cocaine and marijuana.Â  While \r\n  conducting an additional search on February 12, 1994, officers recovered crack \r\n  cocaine in a well house near Gordonâ€™s residence.Â  Gordon pleaded guilty \r\n  to possession of marijuana for the incident that occurred on February 3, 1994.\r\nIn September of 1996, the Department began another \r\n  investigation of Gordon following the arrest of a low-level crack dealer who \r\n  identified Gordon as her supplier.Â  She also identified another dealer, Tommy \r\n  Rhinehart (â€œRhinehartâ€).Â  On September 23, 1996, Rhinehart agreed to cooperate \r\n  with the Department after agents executed a search warrant at his residence \r\n  during which they recovered two bags of crack cocaine, each containing approximately \r\n  10 grams, and a pill bottle containing 1.8 grams. Â Rhinehart informed \r\n  the agents that Gordon had given him the drugs just prior to the search.Â  According \r\n  to Rhinehart, he retrieved the drugs from the door of Gordonâ€™s pickup truck \r\n  where Gordon indicated he had hidden them.\r\nThe next day, Rhinehart met with Gordon \r\n  to discuss future transactions.Â  During the course of the conversation, Rhinehart \r\n  told Gordon that he had â€œflushedâ€ the crack cocaine during the Departmentâ€™s \r\n  search of his residence.Â  On September 26, 1996, Gordon and his nephew, Spencer, \r\n  gave Rhinehart another bag of crack cocaine.Â  Spencer stayed with Rhinehart \r\n  while he sold some of the crack cocaine.Â  On September 27, 1996, Rhinehart met \r\n  with agents and turned over the proceeds from the sale and the remaining crack \r\n  cocaine.Â  At that time, the agents gave Rhinehart $500 in marked money to pay \r\n  Gordon for the crack cocaine that he had â€œfrontedâ€ him.Â  In a recorded conversation, \r\n  Rhinehart set up another transaction with Gordon.Â  Gordon indicated that he \r\n  needed to contact Spencer.Â  Rhinehart was then instructed to meet Spencer at \r\n  Gordonâ€™s car wash.Â  At the car wash, Spencer gave Rhinehart two bags of crack \r\n  cocaine, weighing 9.4 grams and 9.8 grams respectively, and collected $500 for \r\n  a previous transaction.Â  Rhinehart then left, met with the agents, and turned \r\n  over the crack cocaine.\r\nOn September 30, 1996, Rhinehart \r\n  paged Gordon to arrange a meeting time so that he could pay for the two additional \r\n  bags of crack cocaine.Â  The agents gave Rhinehart $1,000 in marked money and \r\n  equipped him with a surveillance wire.Â  Rhinehart met with Spencer at \r\n  a designated location.Â  He then gave Spencer the money received from the sale \r\n  of the crack cocaine that was purchased earlier from Gordon.Â  Spencer left and \r\n  told Rhinehart he would return with more crack cocaine.Â  Spencer met \r\n  Gordon, who was driving the pickup truck, at the car wash.Â  Spencer left the \r\n  car wash, drove to NationsBank, and made a deposit.Â  Shortly thereafter, agents \r\n  arrested Spencer and searched him.Â  The agents found a bank deposit receipt \r\n  for account number 790167308, the business account for Gordonâ€™s car wash.Â  The \r\n  balance of the account was $22,209.85, which included the deposit.\r\nDuring the same time period, Gordon was arrested \r\n  while driving his pickup truck.Â  He was found to be in possession of two cellular \r\n  phones as well as $1,584 in cash, $880 of which was law enforcement funds given \r\n  to Spencer earlier by Rhinehart.Â  Pursuant to this arrest, the State seized \r\n  the following property:Â  the NationsBank operating account of Gordonâ€™s car wash \r\n  business, $22,209.85 plus $726.24 from the payroll account; the $1,584 in cash; \r\n  the pickup truck; and two cellular phones.Â  \r\nThe forfeiture action also included seizures of \r\n  cash in the amount of $821 and $128.Â  On September 29, 1996, agents seized $821 \r\n  in cash from Gordon when he was arrested on unrelated warrants during the search \r\n  of another personâ€™s residence.Â  On October 5, 1996, Gordon was arrested for \r\n  obstruction of justice.Â  While Rhinehart was wearing a surveillance wire, Gordon \r\n  offered him $5,000 to leave town and not testify against him. Â At the \r\n  time of the arrest, the agents seized $128 in cash from Gordon.\r\nUltimately, Gordon was convicted of trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment and payment of a \r\n  $50,000 fine.\r\nThe State filed a civil action seeking to confirm \r\n  the seizure and forfeiture of Gordonâ€™s property. Â During the \r\n  hearing, the State offered Officers Chuck Grant and Rodney Pickel of the Rock \r\n  Hill Police Department, as well as Rhinehart, as witnesses to the above-outlined \r\n  investigation.Â  The State also presented several witnesses who testified regarding \r\n  Gordonâ€™s finances.Â  In addition to this testimony, the State presented Gordonâ€™s \r\n  voluminous NationsBank records into evidence.\r\nChristine Rogers, an employee of a property management \r\n  company, testified she became acquainted with Gordon in 1995 or 1996 when she \r\n  rented him an apartment in Rock Hill.Â  In 1996, Gordon entered into a commercial \r\n  lease agreement for the purchase of property.Â  The terms of the agreement required \r\n  Gordon to provide a $6,000 down payment and then a $750 monthly lease payment. \r\n  Â According to Rogers, Gordon paid cash for monthly rent for his apartment \r\n  as well as the $6,000 down payment.\r\nJohn Comer, a South Carolina Department of Revenue \r\n  employee, testified the Department had no tax records for Gordon individually \r\n  or for the car wash during the years of 1995 or 1996.Â  Margaret Parsons, an \r\n  accountant, began assisting Gordon with his finances beginning in May or June \r\n  1996.Â Â  Based on her review of Gordonâ€™s finances, Parsons believed Gordonâ€™s \r\n  expenses exceeded his business income and that the balance of the expenses was \r\n  paid for in cash. \r\nThe circuit court ordered all of the seized property, \r\n  with the exception of the $128 in cash, returned to Gordon.Â  The court reasoned \r\n  the State had failed to meet its â€œburden of initially showing probable cause \r\n  of a nexus with illegal drug activity of all the property sought to be forfeited.â€Â  \r\n  The court excluded the $128, finding it was â€œmarked moneyâ€ that was seized during \r\n  Gordonâ€™s first arrest. \r\nThe State filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\n  After a hearing, the court denied this motion. Â The State appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action for forfeiture of property is a civil \r\n  action at law.â€Â  City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck \r\n  (VIN # JM2UF1132N0294812), 330 S.C. 371, 373, 498 S.E.2d 894, 895 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998).Â  In a non-jury action at law, the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact have \r\n  the same force and effect as a jury verdict unless he or she committed some \r\n  error of law leading to an erroneous conclusion or unless the evidence is reasonably \r\n  susceptible of the opposite conclusion only.Â  Hiott v. Guar. Natâ€™l Ins. Co., \r\n  329 S.C. 522, 528-29, 496 S.E.2d 417, 421 (Ct. App. 1997); see Townes Assocs. \r\n  v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (â€œIn \r\n  an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of \r\n  fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without \r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€).Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nA.\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in returning the seized money to Gordon.Â  Specifically, the State contends the \r\n  court committed an error of law by requiring the State to â€œdirectly trace the \r\n  seized money to a specific drug transaction.â€Â  The State believes, in light \r\n  of the totality of the circumstances, it met its burden to establish probable \r\n  cause that the NationsBank accounts were used in furtherance of Gordonâ€™s drug \r\n  trafficking. [3] \r\nBased on our review of the courtâ€™s order, \r\n  we believe the court properly considered the requirements of the forfeiture \r\n  statute.Â  In its order, the court found â€œfor moneys taken, the State must present \r\n  evidence that the money is traceable to an exchange involving controlled substances.Â  \r\n  The State presented no evidence whatsoever that the moneys in the account were \r\n  from drug transactions.â€Â  This holding is precisely what section 44-53-520(a)(7) \r\n  requires for a forfeiture of monies.\r\nSection 44-53-520(a)(7) provides:\r\n\r\nall property including, but not limited to, monies, \r\n  negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or intended \r\n  to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance, and all \r\n  proceeds including, but not limited to, monies, and real and personal property \r\n  traceable to any [illegal drug] exchange.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-520(a)(7) (2002) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  In order to analyze this case, we are faced with determining the exactness \r\n  required to prove whether the bank accounts are â€œtraceable to any exchange.â€Â  \r\n  Thus, we must employ the rules of statutory construction.Â  \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno \r\n  Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003).Â  â€œAll rules \r\n  of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent \r\n  must prevail if it reasonably can be discovered in the language used, and the \r\n  language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  \r\n  City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t, 330 S.C. at 375, 498 S.E.2d at 896.Â  If \r\n  a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning â€œthe \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right \r\n  to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  578, 581 (2000).Â Â Â  \r\nAn action for forfeiture is a civil in rem \r\n  action at law that is, by its nature, a penal action that must be strictly construed.Â  \r\n  See Ducworth v. Neely, 319 S.C. 158, 162, 459 S.E.2d 896, 899 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (strictly construing the term â€œknowledgeâ€ to mean â€œactual knowledgeâ€).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, â€œin rem forfeiture statutes must be interpreted in \r\n  light of the evil sought to be remedied and in a manner that is consistent with \r\n  the statuteâ€™s purpose.â€Â  Id. at 163, 459 S.E.2d at 899.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we must apply a strict definition of the disputed text of the statute which \r\n  best fulfills the lawâ€™s purpose to remedy a particular evil.\r\nâ€œThe purpose of a forfeiture hearing \r\n  is to confirm that the state had probable cause to seize the property forfeited.â€Â  \r\n  Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee VIN 1JCWB782FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, \r\n  131, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996).Â  The State has the â€œinitial burden of demonstrating \r\n  â€˜probable cause for the belief that a substantial connection exists between \r\n  the property to be forfeited and the criminal activity defined by statute.â€™â€ \r\n  United States v. Thomas, 913 F.2d 1111, 1114 (4th Cir. 1990)(quoting \r\n  Boas v. Smith, 786 F.2d 605, 609 (4th Cir. 1986)).Â  â€œIf probable cause \r\n  is shown, the burden then shifts to the owner to prove that he or she â€˜was not \r\n  a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge of, the use of \r\n  the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.â€™â€ Medlock, \r\n  322 S.C. at 131, 470 S.E.2d at 376 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-586(b)(1) \r\n  (Supp. 1994)).Â  â€œSection 44-53-586(b) specifically places the burden of proof \r\n  on the property owner to show innocent ownership by a preponderance of the evidence, \r\n  showing legislative intent to place the burden of proving innocence on the property \r\n  owner.â€ Id.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nâ€œâ€˜Probable causeâ€™ for the purpose of \r\n  forfeiture proceedings is the same standard used in search and seizure cases.â€ \r\n  Thomas, 913 F.2d at 1114.Â  A determination of probable cause requires \r\n  the magistrate to analyze the totality of the circumstances, which means his \r\n  task is to â€œmake a practical, common- sense decision whether, given all the \r\n  circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the â€˜veracityâ€™ \r\n  and â€˜basis of knowledgeâ€™ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is \r\n  a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a \r\n  particular place.â€Â  State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 290-91, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  801, 802-03 (1997) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)); \r\n  State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522, 527, 556 S.E.2d 706, 709 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (â€œA â€˜totality of the circumstancesâ€™ test is applicable in determining whether \r\n  sufficient probable cause exists to issue a search warrant.â€).Â Â  \r\nBecause our research reveals no South \r\n  Carolina case that is directly on point, we agree with the State that federal \r\n  law is instructive in deciding this case.Â  In other forfeiture cases, our Supreme \r\n  Court and this Court have consistently turned to the guidance of the federal \r\n  courts, particularly decisions of the Fourth Circuit.Â  See, e.g., Medlock, \r\n  322 S.C. at 132, 470 S.E.2d at 377 (adopting â€œexcessive fine testâ€ set forth \r\n  by Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Chandler, 36 F.3d \r\n  358 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1082 (1995)); Condon v. \r\n  One 1985 BMW, 4 Door, VIN # WBAAE6403F0704170, 312 S.C. 431, 432, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  895, 896 (Ct. App. 1994)(applying Fourth Circuit cases to determine whether \r\n  seized vehicle facilitated the unlawful transportation of controlled substances \r\n  under sections 44-53-520(a)(4), (a)(6)).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nWe are persuaded to consider United \r\n  States v. Thomas, 913 F.2d 1111 (4th Cir. 1990), a case where the Fourth \r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted a federal statute that is similar to our \r\n  state forfeiture statute. [4] \r\n  Â  The defendant in Thomas became the subject of a federal government \r\n  drug investigation.Â  In the course of the investigation, the officers conducted \r\n  undercover drug buys at the defendantâ€™s business in Georgetown, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Government officers also discovered Thomas had significant cash expenditures \r\n  and had â€œunusual travel habits,â€ which included numerous one-way airline tickets \r\n  from Charleston, South Carolina to Miami, Florida.Â  Ultimately, the investigation \r\n  was concluded when the Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested Thomas \r\n  for being an illegal alien.Â  Subsequently, the federal government seized certain \r\n  real and personal property that belonged to Thomas.Â  After a forfeiture hearing, \r\n  the district court ordered the return of the property to Thomas, finding the \r\n  government had not shown probable cause for its belief that there was a substantial \r\n  connection between the property to be forfeited and the illegal drug-related \r\n  activities.\r\nOn appeal, the Fourth Circuit Court of \r\n  Appeals reversed the district court, holding the totality of the facts demonstrated \r\n  probable cause.Â  Id. at 1117.Â  The Court believed the district court \r\n  took â€œtoo stringent a view of the legal standard involved in establishing probable \r\n  cause and too dismissive a view of its own factual findings.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  1115.Â  The Court characterized the district courtâ€™s analysis as â€œ[p]arsing evidence \r\n  in isolation for a fatal flawâ€ which would defeat a finding of probable cause.Â  \r\n  In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that â€œâ€˜[c]ircumstantial evidence \r\n  of drug transactions is sufficient to support the establishment of probable \r\n  cause in a forfeiture proceeding,â€™ without showing a â€˜direct connection between \r\n  the property subject to seizure and the illegal activity that renders the items \r\n  forfeitable.â€™â€ Id. at 1117 (quoting United States v. Edwards, \r\n  885 F.2d 377, 390 (7th Cir. 1989) and United States v. $93,685.61 in United \r\n  States Currency, 730 F.2d 571, 572 (9th Cir. 1984))(citations omitted).Â  \r\n  As the factual basis for its decision, the Court emphasized that Thomas:Â  had \r\n  a criminal record involving drug activity; possessed unusually large amounts \r\n  of cash; made significant cash expenditures which vastly exceeded his legitimate \r\n  income; engaged in drug transactions at his business; and had unusual travel \r\n  patterns.Â  Additionally, informants stated that Thomas had used the proceeds \r\n  of illegal drug dealing to purchase the properties sought to be forfeited.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the instant \r\n  case.Â  Although we disagree with the Stateâ€™s assessment that Thomas is \r\n  dispositive based on a comparison of the facts of the two cases, we believe \r\n  Thomas is instructive as to the â€œmethod of evidentiary assessmentâ€ regarding \r\n  the establishment of probable cause for forfeiture.Â  Id. at 1117.Â  Here, \r\n  the court properly weighed the evidence.Â  It considered the totality of the \r\n  circumstances and did not require the State to trace the money seized from the \r\n  bank accounts to a particular drug transaction.Â  In light of our standard of \r\n  review, we cannot say the courtâ€™s holding that the State failed to establish \r\n  probable cause regarding the bank accounts is without support in the record \r\n  or that the evidence is â€œreasonably susceptible of the opposite conclusion only.â€Â  \r\n  Hiott, 329 S.C. at 529, 496 S.E.2d at 421.Â  \r\nEven though there is evidence that Gordon \r\n  was involved in illegal drug transactions and had significant cash expenditures, \r\n  this evidence did not rise above â€œmere suspicionâ€ that the bank proceeds were \r\n  subject to forfeiture.Â  See United States v. All Right, Title and \r\n  Interest in Real Property and Appurtenances Thereto Known as 785 St. Nicholas \r\n  Ave. and 789 St. Nicholas Ave., 983 F.2d 396, 403 (2d Cir. 1993) (â€œTo establish \r\n  probable cause neither the real property nor bank proceeds need to be linked \r\n  to any one particular transaction, but the government must establish â€˜reasonable \r\n  groundsâ€™--that is to say, rising above â€˜mere suspicionâ€™--that the property is \r\n  subject to forfeiture.â€)(citations omitted).Â  There was extensive documentary \r\n  evidence that the bank accounts contained legitimate business income as evidenced \r\n  by checks from Rock Hill car dealerships.Â  It is also unclear whether the deposit \r\n  ticket the State seized was evidence that Spencer deposited â€œdrug moneyâ€ or \r\n  money from Gordonâ€™s car wash.Â  Furthermore, the State failed to show the withdrawals \r\n  from the bank accounts were used to pay for items in cash as opposed to Gordon \r\n  paying for these items directly from money gained from the sale of drugs.Â  Finally, \r\n  the testimony of Gordonâ€™s accountant did not establish that Gordon was â€œwashingâ€ \r\n  large amounts of undocumented money through the bank accounts.Â  Therefore, we \r\n  agree with the circuit court that the State failed to establish probable cause \r\n  that the money in the bank accounts contained proceeds traceable to illegal \r\n  drug transactions.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the courtâ€™s decision with respect \r\n  to the NationsBank accounts.\r\nB.\r\nBroadly construing the Stateâ€™s argument, \r\n  it appears the State is appealing the entire $25,341.09 amount that was seized, \r\n  which included the NationsBank accounts as well as two cash amounts seized from \r\n  Gordonâ€™s person.Â  These amounts include the $821 seized from Gordon on September \r\n  29, 1996, when he was arrested on unrelated warrants.Â  The second amount was \r\n  seized from Gordon the following day when he was arrested while driving his \r\n  pickup truck.Â  At the time of the arrest, Gordon was found to be in possession \r\n  of $1,584 in cash, $880 of which was law enforcement funds used in the undercover \r\n  drug transactions. \r\nThe State, however, did not address \r\n  this specific argument in its brief.Â  Although the State discusses the â€œmonies \r\n  seizedâ€ from Gordon, its entire argument is devoted to the bank accounts.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find this issue not properly preserved for our review. \r\n  [5] Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, \r\n  444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (stating issues not argued in the brief are deemed \r\n  abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).Â Â  \r\nBecause, however, Gordon admits in his \r\n  brief that there was an amount of â€œmarked cashâ€ seized from Gordon, we hold \r\n  the State is entitled to the $880 of law enforcement funds. Â See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-582 (2002) (â€œAll monies used by law enforcement officers \r\n  or agents, in the line of duty, to purchase controlled substances during a criminal \r\n  investigation must be returned to the State or local agency or unit of government \r\n  furnishing the monies upon a determination by the court that the monies were \r\n  used by law enforcement officers or agents, in the line of duty, to purchase \r\n  controlled substances during a criminal investigation.â€). \r\n  [6] \r\nII.\r\nThe State asserts the circuit court incorrectly \r\n  incorporated the excessive fines test into the probable cause determination.Â  \r\n\r\nIn Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, \r\n  322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 S.E.2d 373, 377 (1996), our Supreme Court discussed the \r\n  application of the Excessive Fines Clause \r\n  [7]  to civil forfeiture cases.Â  In Medlock, the Court adopted \r\n  the Fourth Circuit Court of Appealsâ€™ three-part instrumentality test.Â  â€œUnder \r\n  this test, a court must examine (1) the nexus between the offense and the property \r\n  and the extent of the propertyâ€™s role in the offense, (2) the role and culpability \r\n  of the owner, and (3) the possibility of separating offending property that \r\n  can readily be separated from the remainder.â€Â  Id. at 132, 470 S.E.2d \r\n  at 377.Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the State that the circuit court \r\n  incorrectly referenced the excessive fines test.Â  Although not specifically \r\n  delineated as such in its order, the test was clearly a part of the courtâ€™s \r\n  analysis as shown by the listing of the three parts of the test.Â  This constituted \r\n  error.Â  Because the court did not confirm the forfeiture of the NationsBank \r\n  accounts, the excessive fines test was inapplicable.Â  See Austin v. \r\n  United States, 509 U.S. 602, 622 (1993) (holding forfeiture is subject to \r\n  the Excessive Fines Clause if the forfeiture can be viewed as punitive).\r\nThe courtâ€™s error in applying the test, however, does \r\n  not negate its ruling.Â  As previously discussed, the court properly considered \r\n  the requirements of the forfeiture statute and the Stateâ€™s burden to establish \r\n  probable cause for the forfeiture.Â  In light of our decision affirming the courtâ€™s \r\n  ultimate holding that the State failed to carry its burden to confirm the forfeiture, \r\n  we find the error was harmless.Â  Cf. State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. \r\n  191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990) (finding an error is harmless if it could \r\n  not reasonably have affected the result of the trial); Wells v. Halyard, \r\n  341 S.C. 234, 237, 533 S.E.2d 341, 343 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œAn alleged error is \r\n  harmless if the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the \r\n  alleged error did not contribute to the verdict.â€).Â Â  \r\nIII.\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  Gordonâ€™s pickup truck had not been used to facilitate the distribution or sale \r\n  of crack cocaine.Â  \r\nSpecifically, the State contends the truck was \r\n  properly seized pursuant to section 44-53-520(a)(4) or 44-53-520(a)(6).Â  See \r\n  Condon, 312 S.C. at 432, 440 S.E.2d at 896 (â€œProperty facilitates the \r\n  sale of a controlled substance and becomes thereby subject to forfeiture under \r\n  section 44-53-520(a)(4) or section 44-53-520(a)(6), when, like under the Federal \r\n  Civil Forfeiture Statute, 21 U.S.C. Â§ 881(a)(4), there is a substantial connection \r\n  between the property seized and the underlying drug related activity.â€).Â Â  \r\nIn its order, the court denied the forfeiture \r\n  of the pickup truck based on two grounds.Â  First, the court found the State \r\n  failed to establish probable cause given the evidence showed that the truck \r\n  only served as â€œa location from where drugs were taken.â€Â  Secondly, the court \r\n  concluded â€œ[t]he State presented no evidence as to the amount of crack cocaine \r\n  involved.â€Â  \r\nWe find the court erred on \r\n  both points.Â  On the first point, the court erred as matter of law.Â  Based on \r\n  the language of section 44-53-520(a)(6), the fact that the truck was used to \r\n  conceal or contain the crack cocaine was sufficient to support forfeiture of \r\n  the vehicle. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-520(a)(6) (Supp. 2003) (â€œall \r\n  conveyances including . . . motor vehicles . . . which are used or intended \r\n  for use unlawfully to conceal, contain, or transport or facilitate the unlawful \r\n  concealment, possession, containment, . . . or transportation of controlled \r\n  substances . . . except as otherwise provided, must be forfeited to the Stateâ€).Â  \r\n\r\nAs to the second point, the State did offer evidence \r\n  as to whether the amount of the crack cocaine that was concealed or contained \r\n  within the truck exceeded the requisite statutory weight.Â  Rhinehart testified \r\n  that on September 23, 1996, the Departmentâ€™s agents executed a search warrant \r\n  at his residence during which they recovered two bags of crack cocaine, each \r\n  containing approximately 10 grams, and a pill bottle containing 1.8 grams. Â Rhinehart \r\n  informed the agents that Gordon had given him the drugs just prior to the search.Â  \r\n  According to Rhinehart, he retrieved the drugs from the door of Gordonâ€™s pickup \r\n  truck where Gordon indicated he had hidden them.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-520(a)(6) (Supp. 2003) (â€œNo motor vehicle may be forfeited to the State \r\n  under this item unless it is used, intended for use, or in any manner facilitates \r\n  a violation of Section 44-53-370(a), involving at least . . . more than ten \r\n  grains of crack . . ..â€).\r\nBecause our standard of review in forfeiture \r\n  cases only permits this Court to reverse on errors of law, we may not make findings \r\n  of fact.Â  Thus, we reverse on this issue and remand for the circuit court to \r\n  reconsider the forfeiture of the pickup truck consistent with the findings of \r\n  this opinion.Â  If the court confirms the forfeiture, it must then determine \r\n  whether the forfeiture constituted an excessive fine.Â  See Medlock, \r\n  322 S.C. at 132, 470 S.E.2d at 377 (outlining three-part test to determine whether \r\n  a forfeiture constitutes an excessive fine).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to return to Gordon the NationsBank accounts and a portion \r\n  of the cash amounts.Â  We reverse the courtâ€™s decision regarding the pickup truck \r\n  and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  Finally, we \r\n  order the return of $880 in law enforcement funds to the State.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Â This statute provides \r\n    in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\n  (a) The following are subject to forfeiture:\r\n  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . .\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  (4) All property, both real and personal, which in any manner \r\n    is knowingly used to facilitate production, manufacturing, distribution, sale, \r\n    importation, exportation, or trafficking in various controlled substances \r\n    as defined in this article;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . .\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  (6) all conveyances including . . . motor vehicles . . . which \r\n    are used or intended for use unlawfully to conceal, contain, or transport \r\n    or facilitate the unlawful concealment, possession, containment, . . . or \r\n    transportation of controlled substances . . . except as otherwise provided, \r\n    must be forfeited to the State.Â  No motor vehicle may be forfeited to the \r\n    State under this item unless it is used, intended for use, or in any manner \r\n    facilitates a violation of Section 44-53-370(a), involving at least . . . \r\n    more than ten grains of crack . . ..\r\n  (7) all property including, but not limited to, monies . . . \r\n    or other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person \r\n    in exchange for a controlled substance, and all proceeds including, but not \r\n    limited to, monies, and real and personal property traceable to any exchange; \r\n  (8) all monies seized in close proximity to forfeitable controlled \r\n    substances . . . or in close proximity to forfeitable records of the . . . \r\n    distribution of controlled substances and all monies seized at the time of \r\n    arrest or search involving violation of this article.Â  If the person from \r\n    whom the monies were taken can establish to the satisfaction of a court of \r\n    competent jurisdiction that the monies seized are not products of illegal \r\n    acts, the monies must be returned pursuant to court order.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-520 (a) (2002 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  Although we note this \r\n    case arose in 1996, we cite to the most current version of the statute.Â  Subsection \r\n    (a)(6) of section 44-53-520 was amended effective May 20, 2002.Â  The change, \r\n    however, does not affect the merits of this appeal.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  This case was originally argued before a panel \r\n    of this Court consisting of Judge Goolsby, Judge Connor, and Judge Anderson.Â  \r\n    Due to the untimely passing of Judge Connor, Judge Cureton was substituted \r\n    as a member of the panel.Â  Rather than re-argue the case, the parties agreed \r\n    to submit the case to the new panel based on the record and their briefs. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  With respect to this issue, we note the Stateâ€™s brief is primarily \r\n    devoted to an argument concerning the NationsBank accounts.Â  As such, our \r\n    analysis is confined to this particular item of property.Â  To the extent the \r\n    State appears to challenge the return of the cash seized from Gordonâ€™s person, \r\n    we will discuss that issue separately.Â  Additionally, it does not appear the \r\n    State is appealing the two cellular phones given they were of negligible value.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  The federal statute, 21 U.S.C.A. Â§ \r\n    881(a)(6) (1999 &amp; Supp. 2003), provides in relevant part:\r\n  \r\n    (a) The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United \r\n    States and no property right shall exist in them:\r\n  . . .\r\n    \r\n  (6) All moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other \r\n    things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange \r\n    for a controlled substance . . ., [and] all proceeds traceable to such an \r\n    exchange . . ..\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] Â  Although we note the courtâ€™s order contains several factual \r\n    errors concerning at what point in the investigation the cash was seized from \r\n    Gordonâ€™s person, this does not affect our analysis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â Â  Additionally, even if properly preserved, we find the evidence \r\n    supports the courtâ€™s decision to return the $821 to Gordon.Â  Because this \r\n    money was seized from Gordon when he was arrested on warrants unrelated to \r\n    the undercover investigation, it should not have been the subject of forfeiture. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7] Â  In Medlock, the Appellant argued the forfeiture of \r\n    her Jeep constituted an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment \r\n    of the United States Constitution and Article I, Â§ 15 of the South Carolina \r\n    Constitution.Â  Medlock, 322 S.C. at 132, 470 S.E.2d at 377.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3781","title":"Nationwide Mutual Insurance v.

Brown, of Columbia, \r\n          for Appellant.\r\n        Arthur Aiken and Howard Hammer, \r\n          of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, \r\n  J.:Â  Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company brought this declaratory judgment \r\n  action to determine whether Paula Prioleau was entitled to underinsured motorist \r\n  (UIM) coverage under her automobile insurance policy purchased from Nationwide.Â  \r\n  The trial court found no meaningful offer of UIM coverage had been made to Paula, \r\n  and she was therefore entitled to have her policy reformed to include UIM coverage \r\n  up to the limits of the policy.Â  Nationwide appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nOn April \r\n  25, 1997, Julius Prioleau applied for automobile insurance with Nationwide.Â  \r\n  The application was completed in the names of â€œJulius and Paula Prioleau,â€ but \r\n  only Julius went to the insurance agency to apply for the insurance, and only \r\n  Julius signed as an applicant.Â  At the same time that Julius signed the application, \r\n  he was presented with an â€œOffer of Optional Additional Uninsured and Underinsured \r\n  Automobile Insurance Coveragesâ€ form.Â  This form described the available UIM \r\n  coverage and requested that Julius either accept or reject the additional coverage.Â  \r\n  Julius alone signed the form, rejecting the UIM coverage.Â  The policy issued \r\n  by Nationwide, however, listed both â€œJulius and Paula Prioleauâ€ as the named \r\n  insureds. \r\nOn February \r\n  3, 1998, Paula Prioleau was involved in an automobile accident while driving \r\n  one of the vehicles covered by the Prioleausâ€™ policy with Nationwide.Â  Paula \r\n  sustained bodily injuries as a result of the accident and made a claim against \r\n  the at-fault driverâ€™s insurance carrier.Â  The at-fault driverâ€™s insurance carrier \r\n  paid Paula the liability policy limits.Â  Paula then asserted an underinsured \r\n  motorist claim against Nationwide.Â  \r\n\r\n  At trial, the parties presented the deposition testimony of both Paula and Julius, \r\n  as well as the in-court testimony of Paula.Â  In his deposition, Julius testified \r\n  that normally he and his wife handled the acquisition of insurance together, \r\n  and he could not remember why Paula did not accompany him when he obtained the \r\n  policy from Nationwide.Â  Paula testified by way of deposition that she did not \r\n  have anything to do with the acquisition of the Nationwide insurance policy, \r\n  and although she knew they had to obtain insurance, she did not know her husband \r\n  was going to get it that day.Â  She could not remember whether it was she or \r\n  her husband who handled getting their insurance in the two years between the \r\n  time they returned from Germany in 1995 until Julius acquired the Nationwide \r\n  policy in 1997.Â  In her testimony before the trial court, Paula stated that \r\n  Julius did not have authority from her to act as her agent in connection with \r\n  the application of insurance with Nationwide.Â  She admitted, however, that she \r\n  knew her husband was â€œgoing to get some insurance,â€ and she did not object to \r\n  him going and getting the insurance, â€œbecause [she] didnâ€™t know when he was \r\n  going.â€Â  \r\nNationwide \r\n  argued the rejection of UIM coverage form signed by Julius Prioleau was a valid \r\n  rejection under South Carolina law, and it was not required to also obtain the \r\n  signature of Paula rejecting UIM coverage, as Julius was the named insured and \r\n  the only applicant for the policy.Â  Alternatively, Nationwide claimed that the \r\n  form was sufficient because Julius was acting as the agent for his wife when \r\n  he obtained the insurance policy.Â  The trial court rejected both claims and \r\n  ordered the Prioleausâ€™ policy be reformed to include underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  up to the liability limits of the policy. \r\nNationwide \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial court erred in ruling a valid and effective offer \r\n  of UIM coverage had not been made when (1) such an offer had been made to and \r\n  rejected by Julius Prioleau as the named insured and applicant for the policy \r\n  and (2) such an offer had been made to and rejected by Julius Prioleau as the \r\n  agent for his wife, Paula Prioleau.Â  Because we find Julius necessarily acted \r\n  as the agent for Paula, we reverse the trial court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA suit \r\n  for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by \r\n  the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Antley v. Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. \r\n  621, 625, 567 S.E.2d 872, 874 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  As the underlying issue in the \r\n  present case involves determination of coverage under an insurance policy, the \r\n  action is at law.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. \r\n  231, 237, 530 S.E.2d 896, 898 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In an action at law, tried without \r\n  a jury, the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\n  a review of the record reveals there is no evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Id.Â  â€œâ€˜When an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed \r\n  facts, an appellate court is free to review whether the trial court properly \r\n  applied the law to those facts.â€™Â  In such cases, the appellate court is not \r\n  required to defer to the trial courtâ€™s legal conclusions.â€Â  Allstate Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Estate of Hancock, 345 S.C. 81, 84, 545 S.E.2d 845, 846 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (quoting WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, 342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  631, 632 (2000)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn addressing the agency issue, the trial court found the facts of the case \r\n  did not support Nationwideâ€™s position that an agency relationship existed between \r\n  Paula and Julius.Â  In support of this finding, the court noted the uncontradicted \r\n  testimony of Paula that â€œshe was not aware of her husbandâ€™s intention to sign \r\n  the offer form and that she did not give her husband authority to act on her \r\n  behalf, in any way, in matters having to do with automobile insurance.â€Â  We \r\n  find the trial judge erred as a matter of law in finding the facts did not support \r\n  the existence of an agency relationship between Paula and Julius. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is \r\n  well-settled that the relationship of agency between a husband and wife is governed \r\n  by the same rules which apply to other agencies, and no presumption arises from \r\n  the mere fact of the marital relationship that one spouse is acting as agent \r\n  for the other.Â  Bankers Trust of South Carolina v. Bruce, 283 S.C. 408, \r\n  423, 323 S.E.2d 523, 532 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, the relationship of agency \r\n  need not depend upon express appointment and acceptance thereof.Â  Rather, an \r\n  agency relationship may be, and frequently is, implied or inferred from the \r\n  words and conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the particular case.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n  The law creates the relationship \r\n    of principal and agent if the parties, in the conduct of their affairs, actually \r\n    place themselves in such position as requires the relationship to be inferred \r\n    by the courts, and if, from the facts and circumstances of the particular \r\n    case, it appears that there was at least an implied intention to create it, \r\n    the relation may be held to exist, notwithstanding a denial by the alleged \r\n    principal, and whether or not the parties understood it to be an agency.\r\n\r\nCrystal \r\n  Ice Co. of Columbia v. First Colonial Corp., 273 S.C. 306, 309, 257 S.E.2d \r\n  496, 497 (1979).\r\nIn her \r\n  testimony, Paula admitted she knew she and Julius had to obtain insurance and \r\n  that she knew her husband was â€œgoing to get some insurance,â€ even though she \r\n  did not know when he was going to get it or that he was getting it that particular \r\n  day.Â  While she stated her husband did not â€œhave authority from [her] to act \r\n  as [her] agent in connection with [the] applicationâ€ for insurance with Nationwide, \r\n  this testimony is nothing more than a denial of any express authority \r\n  given by Paula to Julius.Â  The law is clear, however, that the relationship \r\n  of agency need not depend upon express appointment and acceptance thereof, but \r\n  may be, and frequently is, implied by the words and conduct of the parties and \r\n  the circumstances of the particular case.Â  Indeed, the law creates the relationship \r\n  of principal and agent where the parties, in the conduct of their affairs, actually \r\n  place themselves in such position as requires the relationship to be inferred \r\n  by the courts.Â  Crystal Ice Co. of Columbia Corp., 273 S.C. at 309, 257 \r\n  S.E.2d at 497.Â  \r\nHere, \r\n  Paula and Julius, by their conduct, placed themselves in such a position as \r\n  required an agency relationship to be inferred by the courts, and the only reasonable \r\n  conclusion from the facts of this case is that an implied agency existed between \r\n  Paula and Julius.Â  Otherwise, Paula is repudiating the very contract under which \r\n  she seeks reformation.Â  As noted by the Appellate Court of Illinois in a similar \r\n  case, it would be inconsistent to allow a spouse under such facts to argue that\r\n\r\n  (1) she was covered by the policy \r\n    procured exclusively by her husband but admittedly for her benefit;Â  (2) she \r\n    was entitled to recover from [the insurance company] under the terms of the \r\n    policy;Â  but (3) with respect to one aspect of the policy, her husband acted \r\n    without her authority and his decision cannot bind her.Â  To allow such an \r\n    argument would permit [the wife] to accept the benefit of the bargain her \r\n    husband made on her behalf but not the burden.\r\n\r\nMesserly \r\n  v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 662 N.E.2d 148, 151 (Ill. 1996). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhile the evidence supports a finding \r\n  that no express agency relationship existed between Paula and her husband, \r\n  the facts clearly demonstrate an implied agency existed between the parties \r\n  for the purpose of acquiring the automobile insurance policy in question.Â  By \r\n  making a claim under the policy, Paula has essentially placed herself in such \r\n  a position that the court must infer an agency relationship.Â Â Â  Otherwise, no \r\n  policy would exist under which Paula could claim UIM coverage.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the record reveals there is no evidence which reasonably supports the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s finding of the non-existence of an agency relationship between Paula \r\n  and her husband. [1] Â  The judgment \r\n  of the trial court is therefore\r\nREVERSED.\r\n  STILWELL, J. and CURETON, \r\n  A.J. concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] It should be noted that the matter at issue here is the existence \r\n    of an agency relationship, not the scope.Â  Here, we are not dealing with a \r\n    situation where one person gives another only limited authority to act as \r\n    an agent in obtaining specific types and levels of coverage.Â  Accordingly, \r\n    this opinion does not imply blanket authority when a spouse is authorized \r\n    to act in some matter on behalf of the other, and it does not address the \r\n    issue of whether an agentâ€™s authority has been exceeded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3782","title":"Video Gamming Consultants v.

Buck Cutts, of Surfside \r\n          Beach; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, \r\n  J.:Â  After prevailing in underlying litigation against the South Carolina \r\n  Department of Revenue (Department), Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. (Video Gaming) \r\n  asked that it be awarded attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  The circuit court awarded $25,286.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The \r\n  Department appeals.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nVideo \r\n  Gaming operated a video gaming business in Garden City.Â  On July 27, 1995, the \r\n  Department issued Video Gaming a citation for violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  12-21-2804(b) (Supp. 1999) [1]  \r\n  for advertising video games on its premises.Â  Video Gaming had displayed a large \r\n  sign stating â€œSTOP HERE TRY OUR POKER VIDEO GAMESâ€ and two signs stating â€œJACKPOT \r\n  VIDEO GAMES.â€\r\nVideo \r\n  Gaming appealed the citation to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Division, \r\n  contending that the Stateâ€™s prohibition against advertising violated the protection \r\n  of free speech afforded by the First Amendment and the relevant statute should \r\n  be declared void and unconstitutional.Â  The ALJ upheld the citation.Â  The Honorable \r\n  J. Stanton Cross, Jr., sitting as Special Circuit Court Judge, affirmed the \r\n  ALJ decision.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court reversed finding the statute \r\n  was an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech. Video Gaming Consultants \r\n  v. S.C. Dept. of Revenue, 342 S.C. 34, 535 S.E.2d 642 (2000).Â  \r\nAfter \r\n  the supreme court issued its opinion, Video Gaming filed a petition for attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (Supp. 2003).Â  The case was heard \r\n  by Judge Cross.Â  He awarded Video Gaming $27,453.00 in fees.Â  In an amended \r\n  order, Judge Cross reduced the amount by $6,499.00 to correct a billing error \r\n  and also added $3,404.00 for fees incurred between May 2001 through September \r\n  2001 for a total award of $25,286.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding an award of attorneyâ€™s fees under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (Supp. 2003) will not be disturbed absent an abuse of \r\n  discretion.Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182, 394 S.E.2d \r\n  709, 711 (1990).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Zabinski \r\n  v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 601, 553 S.E.2d 110, 121 (2001).Â Â  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\n The Department argues \r\n  the trial court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Video Gaming.Â  We agree.\r\nThe prevailing \r\n  party to a civil action may recover attorneyâ€™s fees against a state agency only \r\n  if â€œthe agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim \r\n  against the partyâ€ and there are no â€œspecial circumstances that would make the \r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  Our supreme court held â€œsubstantial justificationâ€ does not mean â€œâ€˜justified \r\n  to a high degree,â€™ but rather â€˜justified in substance or in the mainâ€™-- that \r\n  is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.â€ Heath \r\n  v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 183, 394 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1990) (quoting \r\n  Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988), which was applying the \r\n  federal Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2412(d)(1)(A) (Supp. \r\n  2003) [2] ).Â  In deciding whether \r\n  a state agency acted with substantial justification, the courts look to the \r\n  agencyâ€™s position in litigating the case to determine â€œwhether it is one which \r\n  has a reasonable basis in law and fact.â€Â  McDowell v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\n  Servs., 304 S.C. 539, 542, 405 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1991).Â  An agencyâ€™s loss \r\n  on the merits does not create a presumption that its position was not substantially \r\n  justified.Â  Kiareldeen v. Ashcroft, 273 F.3d 542, 554 (3rd \r\n  Cir. 2001); see Pierce, 487 U.S. at 569 (noting the government could \r\n  take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose).\r\nIn awarding \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Video Gaming, Judge Cross stated the following:\r\n\r\n  In further response to [the Departmentâ€™s] \r\n    Motion to Reconsider, I point out that [the Department] acted without substantial \r\n    justification when it continued to vigorously prosecute this case after the \r\n    United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in the 44 Liquormart \r\n    case [3]  in the summer 1996.Â  This decision was handed \r\n    down before the Administrative Law Judge decision was issued and substantially \r\n    undercut the legal analysis and argument of the state relative to both the \r\n    Reyelt [4]  and Posadas \r\n    [5]  decisions.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe court \r\n  then explained that the Department had failed to meet its affirmative duty to \r\n  â€œdisclose to the ALJ Division Court and to this Court the impact and legal effect \r\n  of 44 Liquormart.â€Â  \r\nWe find \r\n  no evidence the Department acted without substantial justification in continuing \r\n  its action against Video Gaming after the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision \r\n  in 44 Liquormart.Â  Rule 3.3(a)(3) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR, requires lawyers to disclose to the tribunal â€œlegal authority \r\n  in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to \r\n  the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel . . . â€Â  As \r\n  the comment to this section notes, â€œ[a] lawyer is not required to make a disinterested \r\n  exposition of the law, but must recognize the existence of pertinent legal authorities.â€Â  \r\n  \r\nOur review \r\n  of the record reveals no indication of the Department being less than forthcoming \r\n  with regard to the Courtâ€™s decision in 44 Liquormart.Â  The Department \r\n  did not fail to disclose the case to the tribunals in the underlying litigation.Â  \r\n  The parties argued extensively about the proper interpretation of 44 Liquormart \r\n  during the ALJ hearing.Â  The circuit court likewise engaged in a substantial \r\n  discussion of the caseâ€™s impact in its order affirming the ALJ decision.Â  We \r\n  find no point at which the Department maintained a position that can be viewed \r\n  as disingenuous.Â  \r\nFurthermore, \r\n  the Department was in no position to determine that 44 Liquormart had \r\n  rendered Section 12-21-2804 unconstitutional.Â  All statutes are presumed constitutional.Â  \r\n  Davis v. County of Greenville, 322 S.C. 73, 77, 470 S.E.2d 94, 96 (1996).Â  \r\n  As an administrative agency, the Department â€œmust follow the law as written \r\n  until its constitutionality is judicially determined; an agency has no authority \r\n  to pass on the constitutionality of a statute.â€Â  Beaufort County Bd. of Educ. \r\n  v. Lighthouse Charter Sch. Comm., 335 S.C. 230, 241, 516 S.E.2d 655, 660-61 \r\n  (1999).Â  By continuing its action against Video Gaming, the Department was merely \r\n  enforcing Section 12-21-2804 as it was obligated to do until a proper court \r\n  determined the statute to be unconstitutional.Â  Thus, we find the Department \r\n  had a reasonable basis in law and fact for continuing its action against Video \r\n  Gaming. \r\nAccordingly, \r\n  we hold the trial court abused its discretion in determining the Department \r\n  acted without substantial justification in the underlying litigation.Â  The trial \r\n  courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to Section 15-77-300 isÂ  \r\nREVERSED\r\nSTILWELL,J. and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.Â \r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  This section provided, â€œNo person who maintains a place or premises \r\n    for the operation of machines licensed under Section 12-21-2720(A)(3) may \r\n    advertise in any manner for the playing of the machines.â€Â  It was repealed \r\n    by Act No. 125, Part I, Â§ 8, eff.

Â The water hoses from the pump house led to fourteen different \r\n  plots on the adjacent property. Â Officer Robert Dennis testified he recovered \r\n  several bags of marijuana from inside the house.Â  Wayne Nichols owned \r\n  the property where all the plants were growing.Â  However, he testified he knew \r\n  nothing about the marijuana and had not given Perry permission to grow marijuana \r\n  on his property. Â While conducting the search of the property, the officers \r\n  pulled up 456 marijuana plants.Â  During the search, the officers inventoried, \r\n  tagged, and processed the plants for future testing.Â  Shortly thereafter, the \r\n  officers transported the plants to a secure location. \r\n At trial, Investigator Max Pickelsimer \r\n  was qualified as an expert to analyze marijuana.Â  He testified that he received \r\n  456 stalks of marijuana and analyzed thirty-four of the stalks.Â  He explained \r\n  the stalks were wet when they were bundled together and, as a result, they became \r\n  stuck together as they dried.Â  In attempting to separate them, he was able to \r\n  get thirty-four plants that were strong enough to analyze, and that all thirty-four \r\n  plants tested positive for marijuana.Â \r\nPerry \r\n  did not testify at trial.Â  The jury convicted him of trafficking in marijuana, \r\n  manufacturing marijuana, manufacturing marijuana on the lands of another, and \r\n  resisting arrest.Â  Perry appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n \r\n&nbsp; \r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Directed Verdict\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nPerry \r\n  contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict \r\n  on the charges of trafficking in marijuana and manufacturing marijuana.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nOn appeal from \r\n  the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, this Court must view the \r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Al-Amin, \r\n  353 S.C. 405, 411, 578 S.E.2d 32, 35 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Morgan, \r\n  352 S.C. 359, 364, 574 S.E.2d 203, 205 (Ct. App. 2002). When ruling on a motion \r\n  for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence or nonexistence \r\n  of evidence, not its weight. State v. Wilds, 355 S.C. 269, 274, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  138, 140 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, \r\n  this Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State \r\n  v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).Â  On the other \r\n  hand, if the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged, a defendant \r\n  is entitled to a directed verdict.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, \r\n  544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001); State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 271, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  159, 161 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (Sept. 24, 2003).\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Trafficking in Marijuana\r\nPerry \r\n  argues he was entitled to a directed verdict on the charge of trafficking in \r\n  marijuana because the State failed to present evidence that he was in actual \r\n  or constructive possession of 100 to 1000 marijuana plants, the quantity element \r\n  of the offense.Â  Specifically, he claims the State failed to establish this \r\n  element of the offense given it only tested thirty-four of the seized plants.Â  \r\n  \r\nA person \r\n  is guilty of trafficking in marijuana if he is in actual or constructive possession \r\n  of 100 to 1000 marijuana plants.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1)(b) (2002) [1] ; see State v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. \r\n  22, 27, 524 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œPossession requires more than \r\n  mere presence.Â  The State must show the defendant had dominion or control over \r\n  the thing allegedly possessed or had the right to exercise dominion or control \r\n  over it.â€). \r\nViewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the State, we find there was evidence that reasonably \r\n  tended to prove Perryâ€™s guilt as to the charge of trafficking in marijuana.Â  \r\n  Investigator Salazar testified that 456 marijuana plants were seized from property \r\n  that was adjacent to Perryâ€™s residence. Â The hoses on the plots originated from \r\n  a pump house behind Perryâ€™s residence.Â  Police Chief Swindler testified he recognized \r\n  all the plants as marijuana based on the appearance and the smell of the plants. \r\n  Â Investigator Pickelsimer testified all the plants appeared to be of \r\n  the same type and that the sample thirty-four plants all tested positive for \r\n  marijuana.Â  Â Based on this evidence, it could be fairly and logically \r\n  deduced that Perry was in actual or constructive possession of 100 to 1000 marijuana \r\n  plants.Â  See State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  526, 527 (2000) (stating in reviewing the refusal to grant a directed verdict \r\n  in a criminal case, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State to determine whether there is any direct or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which \r\n  guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).\r\nÂ  \r\nOur decision \r\n  is supported by the holdings of several state and federal courts.Â  For example, \r\n  the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld a conviction for trafficking in marijuana \r\n  when the State presented evidence that only six of the ninety-eight plants that \r\n  had been seized were tested and found to be positive for marijuana.Â  Taylor \r\n  v. Commonwealth, 984 S.W.2d 482, 484-85 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).Â  Because the \r\n  weight or amount of the marijuana was an element of the trafficking offense \r\n  with which he was charged, Taylor argued that each plant used to determine the \r\n  total weight should have been tested.Â  The Court rejected this argument, finding \r\n  there was no evidence that the ninety-two plants that were not tested were different \r\n  from the six plants that were tested.Â  Id. (relying on and discussing \r\n  state and federal cases which held that the prosecution is not required to test \r\n  samples from all individual portions of a controlled substance when the charged \r\n  offense relates to a certain amount of a controlled substance).Â  \r\nSimilarly, \r\n  the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the prosecution need not produce \r\n  the results of any testing to survive a directed verdict motion for growing \r\n  marijuana.Â  United States v. Fry, 787 F.2d 903, 906 (4th Cir.), cert. \r\n  denied, 479 U.S. 861 (1986).Â  In Fry, the defendant was convicted \r\n  of growing and conspiring to grow and distribute marijuana.Â  As one of his issues \r\n  on appeal, Fry argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict because \r\n  law enforcement destroyed all the plants they seized before performing chemical \r\n  analysis.Â  The Court affirmed Fryâ€™s convictions, holding testimony from two \r\n  of Fryâ€™s co-conspirators and a law enforcement officer established the plants \r\n  were marijuana plants.Â  The Court ruled that â€œ[s]uch lay testimony is sufficient \r\n  to support a jury finding that the plants were marijuana plants.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 906.\r\nBased \r\n  on the foregoing, the trial judge properly denied Perryâ€™s motion for a directed \r\n  verdict as to the charge of trafficking in marijuana.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Manufacturing \r\n  Marijuana\r\nPerry \r\n  next argues the trial judge erred in declining to direct a verdict on the charge \r\n  of manufacturing marijuana. Because the marijuana was not grown on his property, \r\n  he contends there was insufficient proof of guilt on this charge.Â  \r\nSection \r\n  44-53-370 of the South Carolina Code makes it unlawful to â€œmanufacture, distribute, \r\n  dispense, deliver, . . . a controlled substance or a controlled substance analogue.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(a)(1) (2002).Â  As a threshold matter, the plain language \r\n  of the statute does not require the manufacturing of marijuana to be on oneâ€™s \r\n  own property. See State v. Baucom, 340 S.C. 339, 342, 531 S.E.2d \r\n  922, 923 (2000) (â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n  and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.â€); State v. Morgan, \r\n  352 S.C. 359, 366, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œThe legislatureâ€™s intent \r\n  should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.â€).Â Â  \r\n  As such, the fact that someone else owns the property is irrelevant in proving \r\n  the elements of the offense of manufacturing marijuana.Â  \r\nWith \r\n  this in mind, we turn to the issue concerning the sufficiency of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, we find the judge properly \r\n  submitted to the jury the charge of manufacturing marijuana.Â  Investigator Wesley \r\n  Boland testified he was engaged in an eradication flight over Newberry County \r\n  on July 21, 2000, when he observed marijuana growing in a field.Â  He also observed \r\n  water hoses leading to a pump house behind Perryâ€™s house.Â  Law enforcement executed \r\n  a search warrant on Perryâ€™s property and found water hoses leading from Perryâ€™s \r\n  pump house to fourteen different plots that had marijuana plants growing. Â This \r\n  evidence reasonably tended to prove Perryâ€™s guilt.Â  Thus, the trial judge properly \r\n  denied Perryâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\n II. Motion to \r\n  Require the State to Elect\r\nPerry asserts \r\n  the trial judge erred in denying his motion to require the State to elect to \r\n  prosecute either the offense of manufacturing marijuana or the offense of manufacturing \r\n  marijuana on the land of another. [2] Â  We disagree. [3] Â  \r\nAt the close \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s case, defense counsel moved for the State to elect between the \r\n  two manufacturing offenses.Â  Because the evidence only showed that the marijuana \r\n  had been grown on Wayne Nicholsâ€™s property, and not Perryâ€™s, counsel contended \r\n  the jury could not find Perry â€œguilty of both under the circumstances in this \r\n  case.â€Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  Based on the statutory language \r\n  of the two offenses, the judge found the â€œLegislature intended for this to be \r\n  a separate offense if you go onto the lands of another to do that.â€ \r\nA.\r\nâ€œ[A] \r\n  motion to elect is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.â€Â  City \r\n  of Greenville v. Chapman, 210 S.C. 157, 159, 41 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1947).Â  \r\n  In Chapman, our Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n  The rule in this state is that \r\n    distinct offenses--felonies or misdemeanors--may be charged in separate counts \r\n    of the same indictment, whether growing out of the same transaction or not.Â  \r\n    If the several offense[s] charged do not grow out of the same transaction, \r\n    then the proper practice is to require the prosecuting officer to elect upon \r\n    which count he will proceed.Â  But, when several offenses charged grow out \r\n    of the same transaction, then the prosecuting officer is not required to elect, \r\n    and the court instructs the jury to pass upon the several counts separately, \r\n    and write their verdict accordingly.\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  at 160, 41 S.E.2d at 866 (quoting State v. Lee, 147 S.C. 480, 483, 145 \r\n  S.E.285, 286 (1928)).Â  In interpreting Chapman, this Court found that \r\n  offenses may be joined in the same indictment and tried together â€œwhere they \r\n  (1) â€˜aris[e] out of a single chain of circumstances,â€™ (2) â€˜are proved by the \r\n  same evidence,â€™ (3) â€˜are of the same general nature,â€™ and (4) no â€˜real right \r\n  of the defendant has been jeopardized.â€™â€ State v. Tate, 286 S.C. 462, \r\n  464, 334 S.E.2d 289, 290 (Ct. App. 1985) (quoting Chapman, 210 S.C. at \r\n  160, 41 S.E.2d at 867).Â Â Â  \r\nIn the \r\n  instant case, all of the charged offenses arose out of a single transaction \r\n  and met the requirements outlined in Tate.Â  Thus, the trial judge did \r\n  not abuse his discretion when he denied Perryâ€™s motion to require the State \r\n  to elect to prosecute either the offense of manufacturing marijuana or the offense \r\n  of entering the land of another for the purpose of cultivating marijuana.Â  See \r\n  Walker, 349 S.C. at 52, 562 S.E.2d at 314 (indicating defendant may be \r\n  indicted and tried for trafficking marijuana, manufacturing marijuana, and cultivating \r\n  marijuana on the land of another); see also State v. Hall, 280 \r\n  S.C. 74, 77, 310 S.E.2d 429, 431 (1983) (holding distinct criminal offenses \r\n  may arise from a single act).\r\nB.\r\nIn a related \r\n  argument, Perry claims the denial of this motion resulted in a double jeopardy \r\n  violation.Â  He asserts, â€œa single manufacturing/cultivating offense applied \r\n  to the case as opposed to the allegation that two manufacturing/cultivating \r\n  offenses occurred.â€ \r\nInitially, \r\n  we question whether this issue is preserved for our review.Â  Based on the arguments \r\n  presented at trial, we can discern no specific argument concerning a violation \r\n  of double jeopardy.Â  As such, we need not address this issue. See Medlock \r\n  v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 \r\n  S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996) (holding double jeopardy issue must be raised to the \r\n  trial court to be preserved for appellate review); see also Humbert \r\n  v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 337, 548 S.E.2d 862, 865 (2001) (stating issues \r\n  not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal).Â  \r\n  However, to the extent counselâ€™s argument can be construed as relating to double \r\n  jeopardy, we address the merits of the issue. \r\nSection \r\n  44-53-370(a)(1) provides that it is unlawful for a person â€œto manufacture . \r\n  . . a controlled substance.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(a)(1) (2002).Â  Pursuant \r\n  to section 16-11-617, â€œ[i]t is unlawful for a person to enter on the land of \r\n  another for the purpose of cultivating or attempting to cultivate marijuana.Â  \r\n  The provisions of this section are cumulative to other provisions of law.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-617 (2003) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe United \r\n  States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution protect against double \r\n  jeopardy.Â  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \r\n  â€œ[n]o person shall . . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in \r\n  jeopardy of life or limb . . ..â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. V.Â  The South Carolina \r\n  Constitution states:Â  â€œNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be \r\n  twice put in jeopardy of life or liberty . . ..â€Â  S.C. Const.Â  art. I, Â§ 12.Â  \r\n  \r\nâ€œThe \r\n  Double Jeopardy clause protects against:Â  (1) a second prosecution for the same \r\n  offense after acquittal;Â  (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after \r\n  conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 195, 519 S.E.2d 786, 790 (1999).Â  Our Supreme Court \r\n  has reaffirmed that Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), \r\n  is â€œthe only remaining test for determining a double jeopardy violation, in \r\n  both multiple punishment and successive prosecution cases.â€Â Â  State v. Easler, \r\n  327 S.C. 121, 132, 489 S.E.2d 617, 623 (1997).\r\nâ€œIn Blockburger \r\n  v. United States, the United States Supreme Court held where the same act \r\n  or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, \r\n  â€˜the test to determine whether these are two offenses or only one is whether \r\n  each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Stevenson v. State, 335 S.C. 193, 198, 516 S.E.2d 434, 436-37 (1999) \r\n  (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304).Â Â  However, â€œa court may conclude \r\n  there is no double jeopardy violation even if the same elements test is met \r\n  where the legislature clearly intends multiple punishments for a single act.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Price, 333 S.C. 267, 270 n.4, 510 S.E.2d 215, 217 n.4 (1998).Â  \r\n  \r\nBecause \r\n  the offense of cultivating or attempting to cultivate marijuana on the land \r\n  of another requires proof of an element that is not present in the charge of \r\n  manufacturing marijuana, there exists no double jeopardy violation.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  based on the plain language of section 16-11-617, the General Assembly clearly \r\n  intended for this offense to be cumulative to other provisions of the law.Â  \r\n  Therefore, it did not violate Perryâ€™s protection against double jeopardy to \r\n  be convicted of both offenses.Â  Cf. State v. Brown, 319 S.C. 400, \r\n  408, 461 S.E.2d 828, 831 (Ct. App. 1995) (emphasizing that â€œthere is no [double \r\n  jeopardy] prohibition against the contemporaneous prosecution by the State for \r\n  both possession with intent to distribute and distribution of crack cocaine \r\n  and the related school charges where . . . they arise out of the same conductâ€).\r\n III. Motion to \r\n  Quash the Indictment for Resisting Arrest\r\nPerry \r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment \r\n  charging him with assault on a police officer while resisting arrest. Because \r\n  the date of the offense as stated in the indictment was incorrect, Perry argues \r\n  the indictment was defective and, as result, the court was without subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, \r\n  defense counsel moved to â€œquashâ€ [4]  the indictment after Officer Lawson testified to the physical \r\n  altercation with Perry. Â Counsel argued the two-count indictment alleged \r\n  the incidents occurred on July 24, 2000, but all the testimony indicated the \r\n  incidents happened on July 21, 2000. Â The trial judge denied the motion, \r\n  but stated he would reconsider the motion at the close of the Stateâ€™s case.\r\nAfter \r\n  the State rested its case, Perry renewed his motion, arguing he was in jail \r\n  on July 24, and â€œthe State has failed to prove the [sic] sufficient evidence \r\n  with respect to that particular indictment.â€ [5] Â  The State relied on the language in the indictment, \r\n  â€œ . . . did in Newberry County, state aforesaid, on or about the 24th day of \r\n  July, 2000, willfully and unlawfully resist an arrest . . ..â€Â  Additionally, \r\n  the State argued the indictment was sufficient to put Perry on notice of the \r\n  charges against him and it had met the burden on each element of the charge. \r\n  Â The trial judge again denied the motion on the ground that it was a \r\n  typographical error.Â  The judge reasoned,Â  â€œI think everyone has been on the \r\n  same page since day one that it was alleged that at the time he was arrested \r\n  it is no question that it was on the 21st.â€ Â \r\nA circuit court has subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over a criminal offense if:Â  (1) there has been an indictment that \r\n  sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; \r\n  or (3) the charge is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  \r\n  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998).Â  â€œAn \r\n  indictment passes legal muster if it â€˜charges the crime substantially in the \r\n  language of the . . . statute prohibiting the crime or so plainly that the nature \r\n  of the offense charged may be easily understood . . ..â€™â€Â  State v. Reddick, \r\n  348 S.C. 631, 635, 560 S.E.2d 441, 443 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-19-20(1985)); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003) (â€œEvery indictment \r\n  shall be deemed and judged sufficient and good in law which, in addition to \r\n  allegations as to time and place, as required by law, charges the crime substantially \r\n  in the language of the common law or of the statute prohibiting the crime or \r\n  so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood and, \r\n  if the offense be a statutory offense, that the offense be alleged to be contrary \r\n  to the statute in such case made and provided.â€).\r\nThe indictment \r\n  for the charge of resisting arrest provided:\r\n\r\n  That ERNEST DWIGHT PERRY, did in \r\n    Newberry County, state aforesaid, on or about the 24th day of July, \r\n    2000, wilfully and unlawfully resist an arrest being made by one whom the \r\n    said defendant knew or reasonably should have known was a law enforcement \r\n    officer, to wit:Â  Officer Curtis Lawson, in violation of section 16-9-320 \r\n    of the South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, as amended[.]\r\n\r\nThe text \r\n  of this indictment charges the crime of resisting arrest in substantially the \r\n  same language as section 16-9-320(1).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-320(A) (2003) (â€œIt \r\n  is unlawful for a person knowingly and wilfully to oppose or resist a law enforcement \r\n  officer in serving, executing, or attempting to serve or execute a legal writ \r\n  or process or to resist an arrest being made by one whom the person knows or \r\n  reasonably should know is a law enforcement officer, whether under process or \r\n  not.â€).Â Â  As such, there is no jurisdictional defect given Perry was apprised \r\n  of the offense with which he was being charged.\r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, Perryâ€™s \r\n  convictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  We note section 44-53-370 was amended effective May 20, 2002.Â  \r\n    This amendment, however, does not affect the merits of this case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  Perry repeatedly refers to this offense as â€œmanufacturing marijuana \r\n    on the land of another.â€Â  However, the actual offense charged is, â€œEntry on \r\n    anotherâ€™s land for purpose of cultivating marijuana.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-617 \r\n    (2003). Our Supreme Court has recognized the distinction between â€œcultivatingâ€ \r\n    and â€œmanufacturing.â€ State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 52 n.2, 562 S.E.2d \r\n    313, 314 n.2 (2002) (stating â€œ[e]vidence sufficient to sustain a conviction \r\n    for manufacturing marijuana may not always be sufficient to sustain a conviction \r\n    for cultivating marijuana on the lands of another, even where there is no \r\n    dispute the property belonged to someone other than the defendantâ€).Â  Perry \r\n    has never asserted any argument regarding this distinction.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  Although it is not determinative of the outcome of this issue, \r\n    we note the trial judge sentenced Perry to concurrent terms of five years \r\n    imprisonment on these charges, which, in turn, were to be served concurrently \r\n    with the twenty-five-year sentence Perry received for trafficking in marijuana.Â  \r\n    As such, we are not required to review this issue.Â  See State v. \r\n    Ervin, 333 S.C. 351, 359, 510 S.E.2d 220, 225 (Ct. App. 1998) (recognizing \r\n    appellate court has discretion to review issues concerning convictions which \r\n    involve concurrent sentences).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Counsel never specifically made a motion to quash the indictment \r\n    but simply stated the dates in the indictment were incorrect based on the \r\n    testimony. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The language used by defense counsel in renewing his motion at the \r\n    close of the Stateâ€™s case indicates that he was actually moving for a directed \r\n    verdict on this charge.Â  On appeal, Perry only raises an argument regarding \r\n    the validity of the indictment and not the sufficiency of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3785","title":"State v.

Stacey, Office of Appellate Defense, \r\n  of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson \r\n  and Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Following a jury trial, Errin \r\n  Hutton was found guilty of three counts of kidnapping, one count of armed robbery, \r\n  two counts of attempted armed robbery, one count of burglary in the first degree, \r\n  and one count of grand larceny.Â  Hutton appeals the trial judgeâ€™s denial of \r\n  his motion to dismiss based on the fact that his counsel was deprived of the \r\n  opportunity to fully cross-examine a key Stateâ€™s witness when he was not provided \r\n  with a pre-trial statement.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHutton was indicted for the various charges \r\n  in connection with events occurring on March 8, 2001.Â  James Bellinger testified \r\n  that on the night of the incident, he was at home with his wife and two young \r\n  children watching television when he heard a knock at the door.Â  He found a \r\n  man named Darryl and the appellant, Errin Hutton, at the door.Â  Darryl asked \r\n  Bellinger if he could get him a bag of marijuana.Â  Bellinger, who had met Darryl \r\n  on one previous occasion, told him he had to go across the street and talk to \r\n  a friend to see if he could get the drugs.Â  Bellinger was accompanied by appellant \r\n  when he went across the street and asked his friend J.T. to get â€œa quarter bag.â€ \r\n  After being told it would be twenty-five to thirty minutes before they could \r\n  get the drugs, Bellinger and appellant walked back across the street to a car.Â  \r\n  Sitting in the carâ€™s driverâ€™s seat was a woman, identified by appellant as his \r\n  girlfriend, and sitting in the backseat was a man.Â  Darryl then got in the car, \r\n  and the man sitting in the backseat, Tony, got out of the car.Â  Tony and appellant \r\n  asked Bellinger if he had anything to smoke in the house, and then began telling \r\n  Bellinger that he owed them $500.00.Â  Bellinger testified that as he stepped \r\n  onto his porch, a gun was pulled on him and he was instructed to go inside his \r\n  home.Â  Once inside, appellant escorted Bellinger to the bedroom, while Tony \r\n  stood in the hallway to keep an eye on Bellingerâ€™s wife.Â  While in the bedroom, \r\n  appellant ransacked the area and asked where Bellinger kept his valuables.Â  \r\n  Appellant started getting upset when he could not find anything.Â  When appellant \r\n  turned his back, Bellinger attempted to get the gun, but appellant hit him in \r\n  the head with the gun.Â  Bellinger stumbled and appellant hit him again.Â  Appellant \r\n  then cocked the gun and Bellinger saw a bullet fly out of the chamber.Â  Bellingerâ€™s \r\n  wife indicated there was a phone call, at which point appellant told Bellinger \r\n  to go into the living room.Â  Bellingerâ€™s wife then realized what was happening, \r\n  and told the men to leave her home.Â  As she approached the front door, Tony \r\n  picked her up and sat her on the couch.Â  Tony then took Bellingerâ€™s wifeâ€™s purse \r\n  and emptied the contents.Â  Appellant held Bellinger at gunpoint as Tony ransacked \r\n  the childrenâ€™s room.Â  The ordeal in the living room lasted approximately fifteen \r\n  minutes, during which time appellant put the gun to Bellingerâ€™s head, and on \r\n  his wife and children, and threatened to kill them in front of each other.Â  \r\n  Because appellant was becoming increasingly upset that they could find no valuables \r\n  and continued to threaten the family, Bellinger told him he â€œknew someone [who] \r\n  had some money.â€Â  Appellant got the home phone number and wrote it down and \r\n  indicated he was going to leave Tony in the house so he could contact him if \r\n  Bellinger â€œtried anything stupid.â€Â  \r\nBellinger testified he and appellant left in a \r\n  car belonging to Bellingerâ€™s wife and drove to Dustyâ€™s house.Â  There, they ran \r\n  into Carson Keen and Nathan Seals, who were in Nathanâ€™s truck.Â  Appellant and \r\n  Bellinger spoke to Carson about getting drugs, and they then left to go to Jessieâ€™s \r\n  house.Â  Jessie was not home, and they then drove to a convenience store so Carson \r\n  could use a phone.Â  Carson exited the truck and went to the pay phones while \r\n  Nathan remained in his truck.Â  Appellant instructed Bellinger to get out of \r\n  the car, and as Bellinger approached the pay phones, he observed appellant talking \r\n  to Nathan through the truck window.Â  Appellant opened the truck door and sat \r\n  inside it.Â  Bellinger then noticed that Nathan â€œgot a really scared look on \r\n  his face.â€Â  He saw Nathan dig through his pockets, and then take the keys out \r\n  of the ignition and give them to appellant.Â  During this time, while Carson \r\n  was at the phones, Bellinger attempted to relay to Carson what was happening, \r\n  but he did not seem to understand.Â  At that time, appellant made Nathan get \r\n  out of the truck, and had all of them walk into the store.Â  After purchasing \r\n  beer and cigarettes, the men walked back outside, and appellant proceeded to \r\n  pull the gun on Carson to rob him.Â  Carson pulled a knife on appellant and the \r\n  two began to struggle.Â  Bellinger and Nathan then ran, until they reached a \r\n  home where the occupants allowed them to call the police.Â  Approximately two \r\n  weeks later, Bellinger identified appellant in a photographic line-up as the \r\n  man who held him hostage and left the house with him that day.Â  \r\nBelinda Bellinger likewise testified that on the \r\n  night in question, she was at home watching television with her husband and \r\n  her eighteen month old and ten day old sons, when they heard a knock at their \r\n  door.Â  Her husband eventually went to answer the door, and was gone for about \r\n  ten to fifteen minutes.Â  When he returned, he was accompanied by two men.Â  One \r\n  of the men went to the bedroom while the other stood in the hallway.Â  Belinda \r\n  did not recognize either of the men.Â  She made an in-court identification of \r\n  appellant as the man who went into the bedroom with her husband.Â  \r\nWhile her husband was in the bedroom with appellant, \r\n  the door was shut.Â  The other man told Belinda everything was okay, which made \r\n  Belinda suspicious.Â  Their neighbor, J.T., from across the street called and \r\n  asked to speak to Bellinger.Â  When Belinda approached the bedroom to tell her \r\n  husband he had a phone call, Bellinger and appellant exited the room.Â  Belinda \r\n  then noticed a red mark on Bellingerâ€™s neck and saw that Bellinger looked scared.Â  \r\n  She then knew something was not right.Â  When Bellinger talked on the phone, \r\n  she overheard him talk about marijuana.Â  The men then started asking for money.Â  \r\n  Belinda told them to â€œtake it outside,â€ and the man who had stood in the hallway \r\n  then picked her up, sat her on the couch, told her to keep her mouth shut, and \r\n  removed her glasses from her face so that she could not see well.Â  The men started \r\n  saying they wanted money, and appellant opened the clip of the pistol to show \r\n  Belinda the bullets and told her he was not afraid to use the gun.Â  The men \r\n  ransacked the house, dumping Belindaâ€™s purse and removing a small amount of \r\n  cash from her wallet.Â  One of them also found Belindaâ€™s pepper spray, and threatened \r\n  to spray it on her sonâ€™s face.Â  The men became very angry when they could not \r\n  find anything to take, and appellant held the gun to Belindaâ€™s nose and to Bellingerâ€™s \r\n  temple, threatening to shoot each of them in the presence of the other.Â  \r\nBellinger told appellant he could take him to get \r\n  â€œsome money or whatever he wanted,â€ at which point appellant indicated he would \r\n  go with Bellinger, while the other man stayed at the house with Belinda and \r\n  the children.Â  Appellant got the home phone number and stated he would call \r\n  if anything happened. He also said he had friends outside in a car in case Belinda \r\n  attempted to leave.Â  Bellinger and appellant left the house, and the other man \r\n  stayed with Belinda.Â  Although she never saw him with a gun, the other man told \r\n  her he had one and he would use it.Â  While waiting in the house, the neighbor, \r\n  J.T., kept calling on the phone and asking if everything was okay.Â  After a \r\n  while, another neighbor, Mrs. Smith, came over to the house and asked Belinda \r\n  if she was okay.Â  Belinda did not invite her inside for fear of putting her \r\n  neighbor in danger.Â  She told the neighbor she was all right, and the neighbor \r\n  left.Â  J.T. continued to call Belinda asking her what was wrong, but she could \r\n  not tell him.Â  Belinda then noticed some headlights through the window blinds.Â  \r\n  After looking through the window and realizing there were police out there, \r\n  the man ran out the back door.Â  Belinda walked outside with her children and \r\n  saw numerous police cars.Â  She also observed a man and a woman on the ground \r\n  with handcuffs on them.Â  \r\nNathan Seals testified that on March 8, 2001, he \r\n  was with Carson Keen at Dustyâ€™s house when Bellinger and appellant pulled up \r\n  in a car.Â  Bellinger looked like â€œhe had fear in his eyes.â€Â  He and Carson left \r\n  in his truck to go to Jessieâ€™s house, with Bellinger and appellant following \r\n  behind.Â  When Jessie was not home, Carson told Nathan to drive to the store \r\n  so he could use the pay phone.Â  While in the truck, Nathan gave Carson a steak \r\n  knife because he had a feeling that something was amiss. Â Carson exited the \r\n  truck and he and Bellinger went up to the pay phone.Â  As Nathan sat in his truck, \r\n  appellant jumped inside, pulled a gun out, and shoved it into Nathan, telling \r\n  Nathan he â€œneeded to give him everything.â€Â  Appellant told Nathan to remove \r\n  his necklace.Â  He asked Nathan if he had any guns, then began searching the \r\n  car for any weapons.Â  He then told Nathan that Bellinger owed him money and \r\n  if he did not get it, all of them, along with Bellingerâ€™s wife and children, \r\n  would be killed.Â  Appellant stated that Belinda and the children were being \r\n  held at gunpoint and if anything went wrong, he would call and have them shot.Â  \r\n  Nathan handed appellant his necklace, and appellant took the keys from the ignition.Â  \r\n\r\nAppellant told Nathan to get out of the truck, \r\n  and all of the men walked inside the store.Â  Some beer was purchased, and all \r\n  of them walked back outside.Â  Appellant called Carson over to talk to him, at \r\n  which point he put a gun to Carsonâ€™s side.Â  Carson then pulled out the knife \r\n  and held it to appellantâ€™s throat.Â  The two men began yelling at each other, \r\n  and Nathan and Bellinger ran away.Â  After going to a couple of homes, someone \r\n  finally let them in their house to call the authorities.Â  Nathan testified he \r\n  had never seen appellant before this incident.Â  He subsequently identified appellant \r\n  from a photographic line-up as the man who had robbed him that day.Â  \r\nCarson Keen testified that on the night of March \r\n  8, 2001, he was at Dustyâ€™s house with Nathan Seals when Bellinger and appellant \r\n  drove up and asked for some cocaine.Â  Carson had never met appellant before.Â  \r\n  Carson told them he could get them the drugs.Â  He noticed that Bellinger was \r\n  acting like â€œsomething bad was going on.â€Â  They went over to Jessieâ€™s house \r\n  to get some cocaine, but Jessie was not home.Â  Bellinger and appellant followed \r\n  them to a convenience store, where Carson made some calls in an attempt to get \r\n  some cocaine.Â  Carson could not reach the dealers he was trying to call, but \r\n  stayed at the phones pretending to make other calls because he was concerned \r\n  about the way Bellinger was acting.Â  Carson saw appellant get into Nathanâ€™s \r\n  truck.Â  At some point, appellant asked Carson to get him some beer.Â  When Carson \r\n  asked appellant for money to purchase the beer and appellant told Carson to \r\n  â€œjust go get it,â€ Carson thought he was going to be robbed.Â  When the men all \r\n  walked into the store, Bellinger followed behind Carson and told him appellant \r\n  was holding his family hostage.Â  Carson purchased the beer and walked back outside \r\n  toward the telephones, where he intended to call the police.Â  Before he had \r\n  a chance to use the phone, appellant called him over to the truck and pulled \r\n  a gun out, sticking it in Carsonâ€™s side.Â  Appellant told Carson to get in the \r\n  truck.Â  Carson refused and appellant told him to give him all his money.Â  At \r\n  that time, Carson pulled out a knife and stuck it to appellantâ€™s throat.Â  Appellant \r\n  then ran, jumped in the truck, and drove away.Â  Carson went into the store and \r\n  told them to call the police.Â  \r\nDetha Smith testified that on the night of the \r\n  incident, she received a phone call from J.T.Â  As a result of that call, she \r\n  went over to Belindaâ€™s house.Â  She knocked on the door, and when Belinda answered, \r\n  she observed a man sitting on the couch.Â  Mrs. Smith asked Belinda what was \r\n  wrong, because it was unusual for Belinda to be sitting in her living room with \r\n  the lights out.Â  She could also tell that Belinda was upset.Â  When Mrs. Smith \r\n  would ask her questions, Belinda was unusually quiet.Â  Mrs. Smith told Belinda \r\n  that she was going to her house to try to get some help.Â  When she reached her \r\n  home, she called 9-1-1, and shortly thereafter numerous officers arrived on \r\n  the scene.Â  \r\nDuring cross-examination of Bellinger, \r\n  it became apparent that Bellinger had given more than one written statement \r\n  to the police.Â  Bellinger testified that he gave a total of three written statements.Â  \r\n  In the first statement, Bellinger wrote about one third or one half of the way \r\n  down the page, but did not finish it.Â  In this statement, he wrote only about \r\n  the robbery, and did not provide any information about the drug activity.Â  Bellinger \r\n  stated, â€œI wrote [the first statement] and [the police officers] told me are \r\n  you sure youâ€™re telling the truth.Â  They told me we know about the drug incident.Â  \r\n  We know about there was drugs involved.Â  And they said, if you donâ€™t tell the \r\n  truth right now, admit to everything, that you could get in trouble.Â  And thatâ€™s \r\n  when I wrote the next one and told the truth about everything.â€Â  Bellinger said \r\n  he lied on the first statement, but only by leaving out the drug activity.Â  \r\n  He stated, â€œ[T]he only difference in the statements was the fact that I was \r\n  going to try to find them drugs.â€Â  Bellinger testified that the first statement \r\n  was thrown away by an officer.Â  In the second statement, which Bellinger handwrote \r\n  but did not sign, he included the drug information, but did not go into details \r\n  about what occurred at the house.Â  The third statement, which was given on March \r\n  10, 2001 and included the drug activity and all of the events occurring on March \r\n  8, was provided to Huttonâ€™s counsel, but the first two were not.Â  \r\nAt trial, the Solicitor told the trial judge he \r\n  was only aware of the statement given on March 10, and he had no knowledge of \r\n  the other statement until Bellingerâ€™s testimony.Â  The trial judge allowed appellantâ€™s \r\n  counsel to cross-examine Bellinger outside the presence of the jury, so he could \r\n  determine what was in the first statement and use that information to impeach \r\n  Bellinger in front of the jury.Â  Thereafter, appellantâ€™s counsel moved for a \r\n  dismissal of the charges arguing, because the other statements Bellinger gave \r\n  were not available, he could not effectively cross-examine him.Â  The trial judge \r\n  denied Huttonâ€™s motion, ruling that he had an opportunity to question Bellinger \r\n  as to the content of the first two statements, and Bellinger had admitted the \r\n  information he provided was incorrect and gave the particulars of how it was \r\n  incorrect.Â  Appellant was found guilty on all charges and now appeals.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHutton argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because his counsel was not provided with the initial statement made by Bellinger, and therefore he was deprived of the opportunity to fully cross-examine a key Stateâ€™s witness.[1] We\r\ndisagree.\r\nPursuant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, criminal prosecutions must comport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness. California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984). This standard requires criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. Id. The State does not, however, have an absolute duty to preserve potentially useful evidence that might exonerate a defendant. State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 538, 552 S.E.2d 300, 307 (2001). Furthermore, â€œ[w]hatever duty the Constitution imposes on the States to preserve evidence, that duty must be limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspectâ€™s defense.â€ Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 488. To establish a due process violation where the State fails to preserve evidence, a defendant must demonstrate (1) that the State destroyed the evidence in bad faith, or (2) that the evidence possessed an exculpatory value apparent before the evidence was destroyed and the defendant cannot obtain other evidence of comparable value by other means. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. at 538, 552 S.E.2d at 307.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence the State destroyed the initial statement of witness Bellinger in bad faith. Bellinger testified the officer threw away theunfinished statement after Bellinger admitted it was not the complete truth, and the officer gave him another piece of paper and told him to â€œwrite the truth.â€ There is simply no indication the officer who threw away the first statement did so in an effort to suppress exculpatory evidence, or with any other bad faith motive. Rather, it appears the officer considered the statement that Bellinger began to write as having no evidentiary value since Bellinger himself admitted to the deception by omission in the statement.Â \r\nAs to the second prong, we find nothing to indicate that the evidence possessed an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed. Exculpatory evidence is evidence which creates a reasonable doubt about the defendantâ€™s guilt. State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 107, 564 S.E.2d 362, 372 (Ct. App. 2002). Here, Bellinger testified the only difference in the statements was that he only included the robbery in the first one, and not the fact that he was going to help the appellant find drugs. There is nothing in this statement which would create a reasonable doubt as to appellantâ€™s guilt. Nor can we find appellant could not obtain other evidence of comparable value by other means. The trial court allowed trial counsel to thoroughly cross-examine Bellinger about the first statement he gave and its contents. Further, at best, the initial statement was of value to appellant in the impeachment of Bellinger. On cross-examination, Bellinger admitted he did not initially tell one of the officerâ€™s about the drugs, he knew that he was not being truthful, and he gave a second statement after an officer accused him of lying. Thus, counsel was able to thoroughly impeach Bellinger before the jury.&nbsp;\r\n  Finally, we see no prejudice to appellant as a result \r\n    of the destruction of the unfinished statement.Â  As noted, appellant was able \r\n    to effectively impeach Bellinger regarding his inconsistent statements.Â  See \r\n    State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 322, 479 S.E.2d 517, 523 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n    (appellants failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from Stateâ€™s failure \r\n    to reveal new statement of witness where counsel was able to impeach witness \r\n    about new allegation by introducing prior statement and questioning witness \r\n    about the discrepancy).Â  State v. Gathers, 295 S.C. 476, 482, 369 S.E.2d \r\n    140, 143 (1988) (appellant failed to show prejudice from alleged non-disclosure \r\n    of doctorâ€™s equivocation on whether wound was pre- or post-mortem where appellant \r\n    effectively cross-examined doctor at trial and doctor conceded she was unsure \r\n    whether wound occurred before or after death); State v. Woods, \r\n    282 S.C. 18, 20, 316 S.E.2d 673, 674 (1984) (there was no merit to argument \r\n    that appellant was denied adequate confrontation of witnesses against him \r\n    based on missing medical records where treating psychiatrist testified and \r\n    was fully cross-examined by appellantâ€™s trial counsel).Â  Further, the \r\n    other witnessesâ€™ testimony directly comports with Bellingerâ€™s testimony regarding \r\n    the specific chain of events on March 8, 2001 and the identity of appellant \r\n    as one of the perpetrators.Â  Several of these witnesses were present as the \r\n    crimes occurred, including Bellingerâ€™s wife and the other victims, who testified \r\n    as to the events just as Bellinger did. Â We find the other witnessesâ€™ \r\n    testimony provides overwhelming evidence of appellantâ€™s guilt.Â  See \r\n    State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (when guilt \r\n    has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational \r\n    conclusion can be reached, the appellate court should not set aside a conviction \r\n    because of insubstantial errors not affecting the result).Â Â Â  \r\n  While we do not condone the destruction of any statements \r\n    made by witnesses to the authorities, we consider dismissal of criminal charges \r\n    a drastic remedy which should rarely be invoked as a sanction for the Stateâ€™s \r\n    failure to preserve evidence.Â  We still caution the prosecution and law enforcement \r\n    authorities that the destruction of evidence will be highly scrutinized; however, \r\n    we cannot find appellant was entitled to a dismissal based on the facts of \r\n    this case.Â  After considering the lack of evidence of bad faith on the part \r\n    of the State in the destruction of the evidence, the importance of the missing \r\n    evidence in light of the availability of evidence of comparable value, and \r\n    the overwhelming sufficiency of the other evidence produced at the trial to \r\n    sustain appellantâ€™s conviction, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n    of appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss.\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, appellantâ€™s convictions \r\n    are\r\n STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Appellant \r\n    challenges only the failure of the State to provide the initial statement \r\n    that was allegedly thrown away.Â  He does not make any argument regarding the \r\n    second statement given on the same date in which Bellinger stated he â€œtold \r\n    the truth about everything.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3786","title":"Hardin v.

Hardin and Martha Hardin Curran (collectively, \r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€) filed a complaint against the South Carolina Department of Transportation \r\n  (â€œSCDOTâ€) in inverse condemnation seeking compensation for the loss in value \r\n  to two [1]  tracts of land they owned on the north side \r\n  of Dave Lyle Boulevard on either side of its intersection with Baskins and Garrison \r\n  Roads in Rock Hill, South Carolina, because of the construction of a median \r\n  barrier in the center of Dave Lyle Boulevard.Â  The trial was bifurcated.Â  A \r\n  bench trial was held on the sole issue of whether the medianâ€™s construction \r\n  deprived Respondents of a property right entitling them to just compensation.Â  \r\n  The trial judge ruled that a taking had occurred and ordered a separate trial \r\n  to assess just compensation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCompleted in 1974, Dave Lyle Boulevard is a high-speed, divided, \r\n  controlled-access, four-lane highway connecting Interstate 77 with downtown \r\n  Rock Hill.Â  Right of way for the highway was acquired from Respondentsâ€™ predecessor \r\n  in title in 1971.Â  The highway was planned and constructed to permit no private \r\n  entrances and a limited number of public road intersections in order to maintain \r\n  a high level of service and safety.\r\nPrior to construction of Dave Lyle Boulevard, two local roads, Baskins Road \r\n  and Garrison Road, intersected in an â€œXâ€ pattern.Â  During construction of Dave \r\n  Lyle Boulevard, these roads were joined on each side of the new highway to provide \r\n  a shared single entry point.Â  A break in the controlled-access line and in the \r\n  highway median barrier accommodated the joined Baskins-Garrison entry point.\r\nIn 1992, the City of Rock Hill requested permission from the SCDOT \r\n  for a new intersection about 1,000 feet east of the Baskins-Garrison/Dave Lyle \r\n  intersection to accommodate a new road that would connect the Rock Hill Industrial \r\n  Park with York Technical College.Â  Because of the limitation on cross streets, \r\n  the SCDOT responded that a new intersection would require that the existing \r\n  Baskins-Garrison/Dave Lyle intersection be closed.Â  Several area landowners, \r\n  including Respondents, protested.Â  A public hearing was held on the matter.Â  \r\n  After the hearing, SCDOT determined that, because right turns were less disruptive \r\n  than left turns, only the median would be closed, leaving the intersections \r\n  on each side â€œright turns in and [right turns] outâ€ only.Â  In 1998, a median \r\n  barrier was constructed across Dave Lyle Boulevard that prevents vehicular traffic \r\n  from crossing over the highway at that point.Â  This median barrier was erected \r\n  in the middle of Dave Lyle Boulevard at the point which Baskins and Garrison \r\n  Roads cross over the highway.\r\nRespondents own two parcels of property that abut Baskins and Garrison Roads.Â  \r\n  Due to the newly erected barrier, eastbound travelers on Dave Lyle can no longer \r\n  turn left across the highway to access Respondentsâ€™ properties and travelers \r\n  exiting Respondentsâ€™ properties can no longer cross the highway to access the \r\n  eastbound lane.\r\nRespondents asserted they were entitled to just compensation for any loss in \r\n  value of their properties caused by the median.Â  The trial judge agreed and \r\n  ruled:\r\n\r\nAt the hearing in this case, Plaintiffs adduced convincing evidence that Plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  Tracts A and B were specially injured by the closing of Baskins and Garrison \r\n  Roads, because they possessed the unique characteristic of directly abutting \r\n  the intersection of a controlled access highway.Â  I conclude that Plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  [sic] are entitled to a jury trial for the determination of just compensation \r\n  due.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in finding that Respondents \r\n  had a valid property right infringed upon by the construction of the median \r\n  barricade?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in excluding the official highway plans for \r\n  the project underlying the decision in Gray v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways \r\n  &amp; Pub. Transp.?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial judge bifurcated the proceedings below and conducted a trial in equity \r\n  solely to determine the question of whether Respondents were deprived of a property \r\n  right entitling them to just compensation.Â  We note that the issue of whether \r\n  the proceeding conducted by the Circuit Court in a case of this type is equitable \r\n  or legal is novel in South Carolina.Â  We conclude that the proceeding is equitable \r\n  in nature and adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Florida in Palm \r\n  Beach County v. Tessler, 538 So. 2d 846 (Fla. 1989).Â  Tessler explicated:\r\n\r\nActually, in an inverse condemnation proceeding of this nature, the trial judge \r\n  makes both findings of fact and findings of law.Â  As a fact finder, the judge \r\n  resolves all conflicts in the evidence.Â  Based upon the facts as so determined, \r\n  the judge then decides as a matter of law whether the landowner has incurred \r\n  a substantial loss of access by reason of the governmental activity.Â  Should \r\n  it be determined that a taking has occurred, the question of compensation is \r\n  then decided as in any other condemnation proceeding.\r\n\r\nId. at 850.Â  Accord Department of Pub.

State, 220 N.W.2d 525 \r\n  (N.D. 1974).\r\nOn appeal from an action in equity, the appellate court has authority \r\n  to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Williams v.

City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Valid \r\n  Property Right\r\nSCDOT argues the trial court erred in its holding that \r\n  the erection of the traffic barricade at issue infringed on a valid property \r\n  right of Respondents and entitled them to a trial for the ascertainment of just \r\n  compensation.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe address the issue of when an action regarding the \r\n  alteration of public thoroughfares may warrant just compensation to those owners \r\n  whose property is negatively affected by the change.\r\nOur analysis begins with the case of Cherry v. Fewell, \r\n  48 S.C. 553, 26 S.E. 798 (1897).Â  In Cherry, the city of Rock Hill altered \r\n  a road approximately 225 feet from plaintiffâ€™s home, but not directly adjoining \r\n  his property.Â  The plaintiff alleged he was entitled to compensation because \r\n  this road closing required him â€œto take a more circuitous and difficult route, \r\n  to his great inconvenience personally, and to the great damage to his said lot \r\n  as a place of residence.â€Â  Id. at 559, 26 S.E. at 800.Â  The Supreme Court \r\n  affirmed the Circuit Courtâ€™s demurrer, finding a mere claim of inconvenience \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œin going from the street in front of his house to \r\n  a particular part of the city, on account of vacating and closing up certain \r\n  streets and alleys in another block, is the â€˜same kindâ€™ of damage that \r\n  would be sustained by all other persons in the city that might have occasion \r\n  to go that way, and although the inconvenience he may suffer may be greater \r\n  in degree than to any other person, that fact would not give him a right of \r\n  action.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 563, 26 S.E. at 801 (quoting City \r\n  of E. St. Louis v. Oâ€™Flynn, 10 N.E. 395 (Ill. 1887)) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  The Courtâ€™s holding was predicated on the fact that plaintiffâ€™s claim did not \r\n  allege any other â€œspecial or peculiar injury, differing in kind, and not merely \r\n  in degree, from that which the public generally sustain[s], which alone would \r\n  entitle a private person to maintain an action . . . for damages.â€Â  Cherry, \r\n  48 S.C. at 560, 26 S.E. at 800.Â  \r\nCherry established the basic rule in South Carolina \r\n  that an alteration of a public roadway adjoining plaintiffâ€™s property constitutes \r\n  a taking of private property for public use within the constitutional prohibition.Â  \r\n  However, when this alteration takes place on a part of the roadway not abutting \r\n  the citizenâ€™s property, that citizen must allege and prove â€œspecial or peculiar \r\n  injuryâ€ to receive compensation.Â  Id.Â  A mere allegation of greater inconvenience \r\n  than the general public, without more, is not enough to prove this â€œspecial \r\n  or peculiar injury.â€Â  Id.\r\nFrom the general holding of Cherry \r\n  emerged the more specific rule of City of Rock Hill v. Cothran, 209 S.C. \r\n  357, 40 S.E.2d 239 (1946).Â  In Cothran, the city closed a portion of \r\n  Laurel Street that, while not abutting appellantsâ€™ property, was a portion of \r\n  roadway on the same block (within one intersection) as appellantsâ€™ property.Â  \r\n  This closing essentially transformed the street abutting appellantsâ€™ property \r\n  from a major thoroughfare directly connecting the property to the cityâ€™s major \r\n  traffic routes to a cul-de-sac.Â  Cothran, 209 S.C. at 369, 40 S.E.2d \r\n  at 244.Â  The Court recognized the application of the Cherry rule, namely \r\n  that, in this situation, the appellants were not entitled to compensation unless \r\n  they had suffered a special injury.Â  Id. at 368, 40 S.E.2d at 243.\r\nThe Cothran Court inculcated:\r\n\r\nThe right of a landowner to recover damages because \r\n  of the vacation of a street depends on the location of his land with reference \r\n  to the street vacated, or the part of the street vacated, and the effect of \r\n  such vacation on his rights as an abutting owner.Â  It is well settled that an \r\n  owner is not entitled to recover damages unless he has sustained an injury different \r\n  in kind and not merely in degree from that suffered by the public at large.Â  \r\n  If it appears that there is a special injury, the owner may recover damages \r\n  notwithstanding his property does not abut, as in this case, on the part of \r\n  the street vacated, because this amounts to a â€˜taking.â€™Â  McQuillin Munic. \r\n  Corp., 2d ed., Vol. 4, Sec. 1525; Houston v. Town of West Greenville, \r\n  126 S.C. 484, 120 S.E. 236.\r\nIn the absence of special injury, no recovery will \r\n  be allowed.Â  The test is, not whether the property abuts, but whether there \r\n  is a special injury, and the first practical question which presents itself \r\n  is whether one whose property does not abut immediately on the part of the street \r\n  vacatedâ€”the part vacated being in the same block between his property and the \r\n  next connecting cross streetâ€”is so specially injured as to be entitled to recover \r\n  compensation on the ground that his access is cut off in one direction, but \r\n  not in the opposite direction.\r\nWe held in Houston v. Town of West Greenville, \r\n  126 S.C. 484, 120 S.E. 236, that the right of an abutting landowner to passage \r\n  at least to the next intersection is a substantial property right; that such \r\n  right is not conditioned on the use of the street in common with the public \r\n  generally, and that the closing of the street was an interference with this \r\n  right and a â€˜takingâ€™ of property within the meaning of the constitutional provisions.\r\nIn the case of Cherry v. City of Rock Hill, \r\n  48 S.C. 553, 26 S.E. 798, it did not appear that the plaintiffâ€™s land was in \r\n  the block along which a portion of the street was vacated; the inference to \r\n  be drawn from that case, as reported, is that such was not the case.Â  For that \r\n  reason, the principal [sic] announced in the Cherry case has very little \r\n  application here, where the appellantsâ€™ property abuts upon a block a portion \r\n  of which is vacated between it and the next street intersection.Â  It is not \r\n  a question whether the land adjoins the vacated portion or not, but rather will \r\n  its value be impaired if deprived of one of the immediate means of access to \r\n  it.\r\n\r\nId. at 368-69, 40 S.E.2d at 243-44 (emphasis \r\n  added); see also Mosteller v. County of Lexington, 336 S.C. 360, \r\n  365 n.2, 520 S.E.2d 620, 623 n.2. (1999) (reaffirming the Cothran rule \r\n  but finding it inapplicable to that case); Gray v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. 144, 151, 427 S.E.2d 899, 903 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992) (quoting Cothran, the â€œâ€˜right of a landowner to recover damages \r\n  because of the vacation of a street depends on the location of his land with \r\n  reference to the street vacated, or the part of the street vacated, and the \r\n  effect of such vacation on his rights as an abutting owner.â€™â€).\r\nIt is undisputed that Respondents own properties \r\n  that abut the joined Baskins and Garrison Roads.Â  The median barrier erected \r\n  by SCDOT altered the existing intersection.Â  The construction of the \r\n  barrier severely limits Respondentsâ€™ access.Â  The fact that Respondents have \r\n  free passage to the westbound lane of Dave Lyle Boulevard is a factor to be \r\n  considered in estimating the damages to be awarded and not in determining the \r\n  existence of this valid property right.Â  See Cothran, 209 S.C. \r\n  at 370, 40 S.E.2d at 244.Â Â  \r\nAccording to SCDOT, a state may curtail, regulate, \r\n  or altogether cease traffic on public roads and highways as a valid exercise \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s police power without liability to any landowner or member of \r\n  the public.Â  See South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t v. Carodale Assocs., \r\n  268 S.C. 556, 561, 235 S.E.2d 127, 128 (1977) (â€œA landowner has no vested right \r\n  in the continuance of a public highway . . . . [T]he State is under no duty \r\n  to maintain a minimum level of traffic flow.â€); South Carolina State Highway \r\n  Depâ€™t v. Wilson, 254 S.C. 360, 365, 175 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1970) (â€œ[T]here \r\n  is a distinction between the exercise of the police power and the exercise of \r\n  the power of eminent domain; that just compensation is required in the case \r\n  of the exercise of eminent domain but not for the loss by the property owner \r\n  which results from the constitutional exercise of the police power.â€). We are \r\n  not persuaded by SCDOTâ€™s argument or cited authority.Â  While the police powers \r\n  of the State naturally allow a broad range of actions to ensure public safety \r\n  which do not per se â€œrequireâ€ that all negatively affected property \r\n  owners be compensated, the exercise of police powers will never be allowed to \r\n  violate Article I, section 13 of the South Carolina Constitution, which provides \r\n  that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.Â  \r\n  See Gray, 311 S.C. at 147, 427 S.E.2d at 901.Â  Cothran \r\n  is rooted in the principle that â€œthe deprivation of the ordinary beneficial \r\n  use and enjoyment of oneâ€™s property is equivalent to the taking of it, and is \r\n  as much a taking as though the property was actually appropriated to the public \r\n  use.â€Â  Wilson, 254 S.C. at 366, 175 S.E.2d at 395.Â  There is no distinction \r\n  between taking and damaging and the least damage to property constitutes a taking \r\n  within the purview of the Constitution.Â  Id.Â  â€œAny suggestion that most \r\n  takings of property are not compensable merely because they have safety as a \r\n  purpose would be untenable.â€Â  Gray, 311 S.C. at 147, 427 S.E.2d at 901.\r\nThe erection of the median barrier is an interference \r\n  with a valid property right of the Respondents protected by the Constitution.Â  \r\n  Respondents presented the testimony of two expert witnesses in regard to the \r\n  â€œspecial injuryâ€ to Respondentsâ€™ Tracts A and B by the closing of the median.Â  \r\n  Based on the testimony of the expert witnesses and the principles of law articulated \r\n  in Cherry, Cothran, Mosteller, and Gray, we conclude \r\n  Respondents suffered a constitutional taking.Â  Concomitantly, the trial court \r\n  did not err in granting Respondents a jury trial for the determination of just \r\n  compensation due.\r\nII.Â  Consideration \r\n  of Plans not Referenced\r\nin a Prior \r\n  Published Opinion\r\nSCDOT maintains the trial court erred in excluding \r\n  as evidence the official highway plans for the project underlying the decision \r\n  in Gray v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. \r\n  144, 427 S.E.2d 899 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  SCDOT asserts that, since these documents \r\n  are public records, they should have been admitted as an exception to the hearsay \r\n  rule.Â  See Rule 803(8), SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nSCDOT sought to enter the highway plans as evidence \r\n  of the facts this Court considered when deciding Gray in 1992, ostensibly \r\n  because â€œthe actual decision is somewhat confusing.â€Â  This evidentiary foundation \r\n  drastically fails to establish the relevance of the plans at issue.Â  There is \r\n  no reference whatsoever to the offered plans in this Courtâ€™s Gray opinion.Â  \r\n  Further, there was no evidentiary foundation presented on which to determine \r\n  the plans accurately reflected the evidence considered by the Court in Gray \r\n  or even the road conditions existing at the date of the taking in Gray.\r\nIt would be improper for the trial court to consider \r\n  this extraneous evidence, not referenced on the record in Gray.Â  A ruling \r\n  under the purely speculative guise that this Court â€œmust haveâ€ considered identical \r\n  public records in reaching its decision would be erroneous.Â  Extrinsic evidence \r\n  not included in or clearly referenced by a prior appellate court opinion is \r\n  not relevant evidence to a later case if it is presented merely to better explain \r\n  that prior decision.Â  Evidence that is not relevant to a case is not admissible.Â  \r\n  Rule 402, SCRE.Â  The trial judge properly excluded the evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial \r\n  court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    At trial, Respondents withdrew their claims as to three additional tracts \r\n    of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
