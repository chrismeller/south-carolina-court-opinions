Dickson, of Orangeburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  In this property dispute, Dorothy Windham appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s finding that Donald and Jennifer Riddle (the Riddles) had an appurtenant easement for irrigation purposes over property owned by Windham.Â  We reverse and remand.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Riddles and Windham are adjacent property owners in Orangeburg County.Â  Both parties purchased their property from a common grantor, Danny Covington.Â  Covington purchased the combined property in 1991 from Edisto Farm Credit.Â  The previous owner, Marvin Davis, had used the property as a dairy farm.Â  In 1992, Covington had the property surveyed and divided into two tracts, 1-A and 1-B.Â  \r\nOn November 15, 1992, Covington and Windham entered into a contract of sale for tract 1-B (the Windham tract).Â  Windham had ten years to complete the purchase of the tract but the contract allowed for early pre-payment.Â  In addition to the terms of the sale, the contract provided in part:\r\n\r\nSeller to have a 50â€™ easement of ingress and egress for the purpose of operating and maintaining an irrigation system.Â  [S]aid easement to be centered over existing underground piping.Â  Seller agrees not to pump pond lower than 4â€™ below full stage.Â  Existing overhead utilities easement to remain as is.Â  When possible seller to run system at times convenient to buyer.Â  Buyer not restricting use more than 36 hours at a given time.Â  Seller to have all rights to use of waters in pond. . . .Â  \r\n\r\nWindham and her family used her tract as a family retreat, and visited approximately every other weekend.Â  Covington continued to farm on tract 1-A.Â  \r\nIn June of 1993, Covington leased part of tract 1-A (the Riddle tract) to the Riddles, who began to operate their dairy farm on the tract.Â  In the spring of 1994, Covington helped the Riddles install an aboveground irrigation system over the existing underground piping on the Windham tract.Â Â  The pumping station for the irrigation system is located on the pond and takes water to the Riddle tract.Â  Access to the pump is controlled by a locked gate on the Windham tract.Â  \r\nIn 1997, Covington conveyed the Riddle tract to the Riddles.Â  The deed provided:\r\n\r\nSaid conveyance is subject to a 30-foot access easement, a 50-foot irrigation easement, a 25-foot access easement along existing woods[,] road and a canal, all as set forth and shown on the above-referenced plat.Â  \r\n\r\nOn December 16, 1998, Covington deeded the tract to Windham.Â  The deed stated, in part:\r\n\r\nSaid conveyance is subject to a (fifty) 50 foot easement of ingress and egress for the purpose of operating and maintaining an irrigation system and an agreement as to the use of said irrigation easement and irrigation system as set forth in the certain Contract of Sale by and between Danny Covington a/k/a/ J. Danny Covington, as Seller and Dorothy Windham, as Buyer dated November 15, 1992 and recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for Orangeburg County on December 28, 1991 . . . .\r\n\r\nInitially, Windham allowed the Riddles to use the water in the pond in the manner described in the contract between Windham and Covington.Â Â  However, Windham believed that the Riddles exceeded the use of the easement as contemplated in the original agreement between Covington and Windham.Â  Accordingly, Windham brought suit seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief asserting the easement created in their contract of sale and deed was an easement in gross and the Riddles had no right to this easement.[1]Â  The Riddles answered, contending Windham was estopped from denying the validity of the easement.Â  Further, they asserted the easement is appurtenant to the Riddle tract.Â  \r\nAfter a trial, the master-in-equity found that the contract of sale between Windham and Covington, along with the Windham and Riddle deeds, created various easements for irrigation purposes.Â  Additionally, the master concluded the easements were appurtenant and, therefore, passed to the Riddles when they purchased the Riddle tract.Â  The master also found no action for trespass could be maintained because as owners of the dominant estate, the Riddles did not exceed the limits of the easement.Â  Accordingly, the master dismissed Windhamâ€™s complaint.Â  The master subsequently denied Windhamâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the extent of a grant of an easement is an action in equity.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  Thus, this court may take its own view of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWindham argues the master erred by concluding the easement was appurtenant rather than in gross.Â  We agree.\r\nWhether an express easement is appurtenant or in gross is determined by the nature of the right and the intention of the parties creating the easement.Â  Tupper, 326 S.C. at 325, 487 S.E.2d at 191 (1997).Â  In Tupper, the court explained the distinction between an easement in gross and an easement appurtenant:\r\n\r\nAn easement in gross is a mere personal privilege to use the land of another; the privilege is incapable of transfer.Â  In contrast, an appurtenant easement inheres in the land, concerns the premises, has one terminus on the land of the party claiming it, and is essentially necessary to the enjoyment thereof.Â  It also passes with the dominant estate upon conveyance.Â  Unless an easement has all the elements necessary to be an appurtenant easement, it will be characterized as a mere easement in gross.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 325, 487 S.E.2d at 191 (citations omitted).Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the contract of sale between Covington and Windham was an installment land contract.Â  Typically, as in the contract here, the seller retains legal title until the purchase price has been fully paid, and the purchaser is entitled to immediate possession.Â  See Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 170-73, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363-64 (2002) (stating the seller retains legal title until the purchase price is fully paid and the vendee in possession of the land is the owner of an equitable interest in the property).Â  \r\nAn easement cannot exist where both the purported servient and dominant estates are owned by the exact same person.Â  Haselden v. Schein, 167 S.C. 534, 539,166 S.E.2d 634, 635 (1932). Â As Covington retained legal title to the Windham tract and also held title to the Riddle tract, no easement could have been created by the Windham contract of sale in 1992.  [2]   \r\nIn 1998, Covington deeded the Windham tract to her.Â  The Windham deed referred to the language in the contract of sale, which reserved an easement in the favor of â€œthe Sellerâ€ only.Â  By the time of the transfer of the deed and creation of the easement, Covington no longer owned the Riddle tract, the land benefited by the easement.\r\nWe find the current case similar to Springob v. Farrar, 334 S.C. 585, 514 S.E.2d 135 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Springob, Dr. Shenoy owned Lot 14, and his wife owned the adjoining lot, Lot 13, where the Shenoysâ€™s home was located.Â  The Shenoys built a well on Lot 14 and attached the well to an irrigation system serving Lot 13.Â  In 1986, Dr. Shenoy sold Lot 14 to L.G.B., Inc., and the deed â€œreserved to Grantorâ€ an easement on Lot 13 for use of the well on Lot 14.Â  A house was built on Lot 14 and eventually the Farrars bought the property.Â  The Farrar deed stated â€œthis conveyance is subject to all easements . . . of record affecting said property.â€Â  Their closing attorney informed them of the well located on their property.Â  In 1989, Mrs. Shenoy sold Lot 13 to Kenneth Perry, and South Carolina Federal Savings Bank obtained title to the lot through foreclosure.Â  While Lot 13 was vacant, the Farrars disconnected the well on their property from the Lot 13 irrigation system and connected it to their own system serving Lot 14.Â  \r\nIn 1993, Springob purchased Lot 13 and eventually demanded use of the well.Â Â Â  When the Farrars refused, Springob brought suit.Â  In finding the easement was in gross rather than appurtenant, this court elucidated:\r\n\r\nIn this case, [the] L.G.B. Deed reserved an easement in favor of â€œthe Grantor.â€ The grantor of the L.G.B. Deed was Dr. Shenoy, the sole owner of Lot 14. Because the easement was reserved for Dr. Shenoy only, and Dr. Shenoy did not own Lot 13, the lot benefit[]ed by the easement, the requirement that an appurtenant easement have â€œone terminus on the land of the party claiming itâ€ is not satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Id. at 589, 514 S.E.2d at 137-38.Â  \r\nSimilar to the reservation in Springob, the language in the contract of sale referred to in the Windam deed reserved the easement for â€œthe Sellerâ€ only.Â  Like Dr. Shenoy, Covington did not own the purported dominant estate at the time of the creation of the easement.Â  The requirement that an appurtenant easement have a terminus on the land of the party claiming it is not satisfied.Â  Accordingly, because the elements of an appurtenant easement are not present, the presumption that exists in favor of appurtenant easements simply is not applicable.Â  See Springob, 334 S.C. at 589 n.3, 514 S.E.2d at 138 n.3.Â  We conclude the master erred in holding the easement was appurtenant rather than in gross.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWindham also argues the master erred in failing to enjoin the Riddles from crossing the Windham tract.Â  Because we hold the easement was in gross and thus the Riddles had no right to use the easement, we find the master erred by not enjoining the Riddles from using the easement.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the decision of the master finding the Riddles possessed an irrigation easement appurtenant to their land is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.Â  STILWELL, J., dissents in a separate opinion.Â  \r\n STILWELL, J., (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent because I conclude an appurtenant easement was established in the contract for the sale of the land from Covington to Windham.Â  The majority finds no appurtenant easement was created because Covington needed to both (1) retain a sufficient interest in the land he sold by contract to Windham, and (2) remain the owner of the dominant estate until title passed to Windham.Â  I am not convinced either proposition is essential to the creation of the easement appurtenant in this case.\r\nAs a threshold issue, there is a question as to the proper scope of appellate review.Â  As stated in the majority opinion, the determination of the extent of an easement is a question in equity, allowing the appellate court to take its own view of the evidence.Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410-11, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  However, the determination whether an easement exists is a question of fact in a law case subject to an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of review when tried by a judge without a jury.Â  Id. at 410, 496 S.E.2d at 635; Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551-52, 357 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987).Â  If this case is viewed from the standpoint of whether an appurtenant easement was created, then it is a law case and our scope of review is narrow.Â  Nevertheless, I am convinced that under either a narrow or broad scope of review, the trial judgeâ€™s analysis should prevail.\r\nThe key to resolving this case lies in determining when the easement was created.Â  The majority cites Haselden v. Schein, 167 S.C. 534, 539, 166 S.E. 634, 635 (1932), for the proposition that an easement cannot exist where both the purported servient and dominant estates are owned by the same person.Â  Because Covington retained bare legal title to the tract he sold by contract to Windham, the majority opinion concludes his ownership violates the Haselden rule.Â  However, the facts and holding of Haselden are inapposite.Â  In Haselden, the dominant and servient estates were merged well after the creation of the easement, and the court ultimately concluded the easement was not extinguished, stating â€œ[t]he rule of law that an easement may be extinguished by the conveyance of the servient estate without notice to the purchaser, of the easement, carries with it the idea that there has been an intentional concealment or deception which imposed upon the purchaser.Â  No such thing is shown here.â€Â  Id. at 540, 166 S.E. at 636.Â  There is no contention that any concealment, intentional or otherwise, is involved in this case.Â  \r\nIn my view, the majority errs in dismissing the possibility that the easement was created in the contract for the sale of the land from Covington to Windham.Â  That document, rather than the deed, is the instrument that established the legal relationship between the parties.Â  It was the functional equivalent of a conveyance coupled with a method of financing â€œfrequently called a â€˜poor manâ€™s mortgage.â€™â€Â  See Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 171, 568 S.E. 2d 361, 363 (2002) (containing an excellent discussion concerning the nature and characteristics of an installment contract for the sale of land).Â  All rights of possession to the land described in the contract were conveyed to Windham, and had Covington not reserved the easement in the contract, he would never have been able to assert an easement of any type upon the later transfer of the bare legal title, even if he had still owned the dominant estate.Â  Any attempt to do so would have been a breach of the terms of the contract that established the legal relationship between the parties.Â  \r\nThere is little legal distinction, insofar as the respective rights of the parties are concerned, between a transaction consisting of a deed and note and mortgage as security for the payment of the remaining purchase price and an executory contract requiring retention of the title in the seller until the purchase price is totally paid.Â  As stated in Lewis, â€œ[f]or years, in an executory contract for the sale of land our Court has equated the vendor with the mortgagee and the vendee with the mortgagor.â€Â  Id. at 173, 568 S.E.2d at 364 (citing Dempsey v. Huskey, 224 S.C. 536, 80 S.E.2d 119 (1954)); see also Southern Pole Bldgs., Inc. v. Williams, 289 S.C. 521, 524, 347 S.E.2d 121, 122-23 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nBecause I conclude the easement appurtenant was created in the contract for the sale of the land, no discussion of the requirement that an appurtenant easement have one terminus on the land of the party claiming is necessary.Â  See Springob v. Farrar, 334 S.C. 585, 589, 514 S.E.2d 135, 137 (Ct. App. 1999) (requiring an appurtenant easement have a terminus on the land of the party claiming the easement).Â  Nevertheless, Springob, heavily relied upon by the majority, is easily distinguishable.Â  In Springob, the person who reserved the easement never owned the purported dominant estate, only owning at one time the servient estate. Id. at 587, 514 S.E.2d at 136.Â  In this case, Covington unquestionably owned the dominant estate at the time the contract was entered into.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the fact that the Riddle deed did not create an appurtenant easement, as noted in footnote 2 of the majority opinion, is not dispositive.Â  The deed to the Riddles could not have been an instrument used to create an easement over the Windham tract.Â  It could have mentioned that easement, since the Riddle deed conveyed the dominant estate.Â  However, there is no necessity to expressly mention an easement appurtenant when conveying the dominant estate.Â  Smith&nbsp;v. Commâ€™r of Pub. Works, 312 S.C. 460, 468, 441 S.E.2d 331, 336 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The easement is but one of the numerous â€œrights, members, hereditaments and appurtenances to said premises belonging or in any wise incident or appertainingâ€ and accompanies the conveyance of the fee.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-10 (Rev. 1991).\r\nIn my judgment, all the elements necessary for the creation of an easement appurtenant were in existence at the time the contract was entered into between Covington and Windham, and the later conveyance of the â€œbare legal titleâ€ was a required fulfillment of the contractual terms already set in stone.Â  I would affirm, and I therefore dissent.\r\n\r\n[1] In addition, Windham alleged the Riddles operated the irrigation pump excessively, drained the water in the pond too low, and left the gate open on the road to the pond, allowing strangers and cows to roam freely upon the Windham tract. Â Windham also maintained the Riddlesâ€™ son hunted on the Windham tract without her permission.Â  \r\n[2] We find no language in the Riddle deed creating an appurtenant easement.Â  The Riddle deed merely said the land was â€œsubject to a 50-foot irrigation easement.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4146","title":"Commander Health Care Facilities v.

Acts, Proviso 9.35.Â  This bill, which became effective on July 1, 1998, authorized a substantial number of additional Medicaid patient days and set forth provisions for granting permits for the additional Medicaid days â€œnotwithstanding any other provision of law.â€Â  At the time this bill passed, Heritage Home had already requested approval of additional Medicaid beds through the May CON. \r\nIn September 1998, Senator Hugh Leatherman of Florence requested an interpretation of Proviso 9.35 from DHEC Commissioner Douglas E. Bryant.Â  After researching the legislative intent of the proviso, Commissioner Bryant responded to Senator Leatherman by letter opining the Proviso applied to currently licensed beds plus those nursing home beds issued under a 1998 certificate of need.&nbsp; Commissioner Bryant also stated that Proviso 9.35 would allow for the expansion of Medicaid beds without requiring a CON because the â€œlegislative intent was to maximize the number of beds available.â€&nbsp; \r\nOn October 5, 1998, DHEC authorized Heritage Home to license forty-four additional Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35 and withdrew Heritage Homeâ€™s pending May 1998 CON.Â  DHEC never issued a CON for the new Medicaid beds; the only approval was pursuant to Proviso 9.35. Â Commander never applied for any of the additional Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35, nor did DHEC deny Commander approval for additional beds under the proviso. Â Â \r\nIn June 2000, Commander filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to overturn DHECâ€™s approval of additional new Medicaid beds for Heritage Home.Â  Commander also sought a declaration that DHECâ€™s grant of permission to Heritage Home to build new Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35 without obtaining a CON was in violation of the provisions of the South Carolina Code prohibiting special legislation.Â  In addition, Commander sought a permanent injunction prohibiting DHEC from authorizing the construction of new Medicaid beds under Proviso 9.35 without requiring facilities to obtain a CON. Â Â Commander and Heritage Home, together with DHEC, filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  Heritage Home and DHEC argued Commander lacked the standing necessary to maintain the declaratory judgment action.Â  The circuit court agreed, and granted the motion.Â Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nCommander argues the circuit court erred in (1) finding Commander lacked standing, and (2) granting summary judgment in favor of Heritage Home and DHEC.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Standing\r\nCommander contends the circuit court erred in finding that it suffered no injury in fact, and therefore, lacked standing to maintain the declaratory judgment action.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the litigation.Â  Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 478 S.E.2d 841 (1996).Â  One must be a real party in interest.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Commâ€™n, 336 S.C. 174, 181, 519 S.E.2d 567, 571 (1999).Â  Constitutional standing requires, at a minimum, that the party bringing the action sustain a direct injury or the immediate danger a direct injury will be sustained.Â  Beaufort Realty Co. v. South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, 346 S.C. 298, 302-03, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 530, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).Â  The injury must be of a personal nature to the party bringing the action, not merely of a general nature that is common to all members of the public. Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 34, 530 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2000).\r\nOur supreme court has articulated a stringent standing test.Â  Sea Pines Assâ€™n for the Prot. of Wildlife v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. &amp; Cmty. Servs. Assocs., Inc., 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001).Â  A party seeking to establish standing must prove the â€œirreducible constitutional minimum of standing,â€ which consists of three elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact; (2) the injury and the conduct complained of must be causally connected; and (3) it must be likely, rather than merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.Â  Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992)).Â  The party seeking to establish standing carries the burden of demonstrating each of the three elements.Â  Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 601, 550 S.E.2d at 291.\r\nAn â€œinjury in factâ€ has been defined as â€œan invasion of a legally protected interestâ€ which is â€œconcrete and particularizedâ€ and â€œactual or imminent,â€ not â€œconjectural or hypothetical.â€Â  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.Â  In order for the injury to be particularized, it must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.Â  Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 601, 550 S.E.2d at 291; see also Beaufort Realty, 346 S.C. at 301, 551 S.E.2d at 589 (finding one must suffer an actual injury in fact, not a concern of future harm, in order to satisfy the Lujan test).Â  \r\nCommander argues that because the forty-four Medicaid beds issued to Heritage Home are permanently removed from the pool of available beds in Florence County, it will be unable to add additional Medicaid beds to its facility in the future.Â  However, a â€œprospective concern of future harmâ€ is not sufficient to satisfy the Lujan test.Â  See Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 602, 550 S.E.2d at 291.Â  The mere likelihood that if Commander applies for new beds it will not receive them due to DHECâ€™s action in awarding Heritage Home beds under Proviso 9.35, is too tenuous to maintain standing.Â  See Beaufort Realty, 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (holding constitutional standing requires, at a minimum, a direct injury or the immediate danger a direct injury will be sustained.).Â  Accordingly, Commander must prove that it is injured by the issuance of the forty-four new Medicaid beds to Heritage Home under Proviso 9.35.Â Â  \r\nCommander submitted no evidence to the circuit court establishing any harm it suffered as a result of DHECâ€™s issuance of Medicaid beds to Heritage Home under Proviso 9.35.Â  It failed to put forth any evidence that it applied for and was denied Medicaid beds contemporaneous with or since Heritage Home was awarded beds under the Proviso and has not asserted that it has any particular plans to apply for beds in the future.[1] Â See Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 601, 550 S.E.2d at 291 (â€œThe party seeking to establish standing carries the burden of demonstrating each of the three element.â€).Â  Furthermore, Â Â Commander never applied for additional Medicaid beds under the CON process, and as a result, cannot adduce evidence that it lost Medicaid beds because of the issuance of Medicaid beds to Heritage Home under the Proviso.Â  Additionally, no affidavit or deposition testimony was offered to establish a loss of competitive advantage or unequal treatment under Proviso 9.35.Â  In fact, the Joint Annual Report of Nursing Care Facilities demonstrates the occupancy rate for Commanderâ€™s licensed beds has remained constant from 1997 through 2001 at approximately ninety-nine percent.Â  Commanderâ€™s allegations that it may lose the opportunity for additional Medicaid beds in the future as a result of Heritage Home receiving forty-four new Medicaid beds are based purely upon conjecture.Â  Therefore, Commander failed to carry its burden of proving it suffered an injury in fact.Â  Accordingly, Commander cannot satisfy the Lujan standing requirements.[2]\r\nII.&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\nCommander argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Heritage Home and DHEC.&nbsp; Specifically, Commander contends the circuit court erred in adopting DHECâ€™s interpretation of Proviso 9.35 that the term â€œMedicaid patient daysâ€ as used in the proviso is synonymous with the term â€œMedicaid patient bedsâ€ as used in the CON program.Â  Because we hold Commander lacked the standing necessary to maintain this action, we decline to address this argument.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).&nbsp; \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Commander lacked the standing necessary to maintain its action against Heritage Home and DHEC, the decision of the circuit court is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n BEATTY and SHORT, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We are cognizant of the fact that Commander could not have anticipated DHECâ€™s interpretation of Proviso 9.35 would allow it to apply for Medicaid beds without participating in the formal CON process. However, Commander could have applied for beds under the CON process.\r\n[2] We also reject Commanderâ€™s argument on rehearing that it has standing pursuant to principles governing taxpayer standing.Â  Commander never advanced the argument of taxpayer standing to the circuit court or in its brief.Â  It is a well-settled principle of appellate advocacy that â€œ[t]he losing party must\r\nfirst try to convince the lower court it is has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the appellate court that the lower court erred.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 421, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).Â  â€œThis principle underlies the long-established preservation requirement that the losing party generally must both present his issues and arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will review those issues and arguments.â€Â  Id.; see also Collins Entertainment Corp. v.

Avery and Gerald W. Avery a decree of separate maintenance and support, declining to award alimony to Wife or attorneyâ€™s fees to either party, and awarding Husband 62.5 percent of the $1.5 million marital estate.Â  On appeal, Wife argues she is entitled to alimony, a larger portion of the marital estate, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  She also argues the family courtâ€™s valuation of her jewelry and mink coat was inflated.Â  Husband argues the family court failed to include certain funds in the marital estate and erred by including certain other funds.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter twenty-five years of marriage, Husband and Wife separated in February 2004.Â  At the time of the final hearing, which took place on December 15, 2004, Husband was sixty-seven years old, and Wife was fifty-eight years old.Â  The parties have no children together, though they have children from previous relationships.Â  Husband has two adult daughters, both of whom have children.Â  Wife has one forty-year-old daughter who is autistic and lives in a group home.\r\nDuring the marriage, Husband worked as a chemical engineer and had management responsibilities. Â For much of his career he worked overseas in places such as Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China, and several countries in Europe.Â  While he was out of the country, Husband sent his paychecks to Wife, and she was in charge of their financial affairs and maintaining the marital home.Â  Wife has a business college degree, but with the consent of Husband, did not work outside the home for much of the marriage.Â  In fact, her only job outside the home was working part-time for Husbandâ€™s business, which she did only sporadically during the marriage. Together the parties amassed a large estate, totaling over $1.5 million.\r\nIn October of 2002, Husband had a heart attack, and he retired shortly thereafter.Â  After Husbandâ€™s retirement, the partiesâ€™ relationship, which may already have had its difficulties, took a turn for the worse.Â  Wife testified Husband belittled her family and was very controlling of her.Â  In 2003, she suggested they get counseling, but Husband refused.Â  Wife left the marital home because she â€œjust couldnâ€™t take the constant bickering.â€Â  \r\nAccording to Husband, the coupleâ€™s problems coincided with Wifeâ€™s renewed friendship with an old friend, Gayle Britt.Â  He testified that Wife spent more time with Gayle than she did with him.Â  He also believed Wifeâ€™s greed was a driving force behind the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  He testified that he wanted to reconcile with Wife, but when he suggested counseling, Wife would go only on the condition that Husband give her â€œhalf of the assetsâ€ in their vacation home in Beaufort, South Carolina.Â  \r\nOn February 4, 2004, the parties had a serious argument, and Wife left the marital home.Â  On February 9, Husband gave $89,000 to his children, purportedly to pay for his grandchildrenâ€™s college education.Â  Most of this money, $71,500, came from a money market account.Â  On February 20, Wife filed a complaint seeking an order for separate maintenance and support.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, several issues were litigated.Â  Wife sought alimony, a fifty percent division of the marital estate, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  She also argued that the money market account Husband divested just days before she filed her complaint should be included in the marital estate.Â  \r\nHusband argued Wife should not receive alimony because he was no longer earning an income.Â  He also argued he was entitled to more than half of the marital estate because his contributions accounted for ninety-nine percent of the partiesâ€™ assets.Â  During the course of the litigation, Husband questioned how Wife had the money to add approximately $54,000 to a bank CD that was jointly titled between Wife and her aunt.Â  Both Wife and her aunt testified that this deposit was made with the auntâ€™s money.Â  Husband, however, believed it was money Wife had siphoned off from the marital estate over the years, and he sought to have the money included in the marital estate.Â Â  Husband also sought to include a checking account jointly titled to Wife and her aunt, which contained $64,000.Â  Both Wife and her aunt testified this was also the auntâ€™s money.Â  The family court sided with Wife and her aunt as to both accounts, and declined to include the $54,000 bank CD or the $64,000 checking account in the marital estate.Â  \r\nAs to the money market account with the $71,500 Husband gave to his children, Husband argued he inherited those funds when his mother died in 1999.[1]Â  The family court, however, included the $71,500 in the marital estate.Â Â  \r\nThe family court specifically found neither party was at fault for the marriageâ€™s deterioration, but declined to award Wife alimony because Husband no longer earned an income.Â  The family court also awarded Husband 62.5 percent of the marital estate and ordered the parties to pay their own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Both parties filed Rule 59(e) motions.Â  In its order addressing those motions, the family court clarified how certain funds held in escrow were to be disbursed and otherwise denied both motions to reconsider.Â  Both parties appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen considering an appeal from the family court, appellate courts have the authority to find the facts in accordance with their view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Ex parte Morris,&nbsp;367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).Â  However, appellate courts defer to the family court judgeâ€™s determinations of witnessesâ€™ credibility because the family court judge had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses testify.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623&nbsp;(2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nWife argues the family court erred in (1) awarding her a mere 37.5 percent of the marital estate; (2) failing to award her alimony, especially in light of the lopsided equitable distribution; (3) valuing her jewelry at $40,000; (4) valuing her twenty-year-old mink coat at $8,000; and (5) failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We address these issues in turn below.\r\nA. Equitable Distribution \r\nWife argues the family court erred in awarding her 37.5 percent of the marital estate when this was a long-term marriage throughout which she provided homemaker services, and neither party was found to be at fault for the marriageâ€™s breakup.Â  We agree.\r\nThe division of marital property is in the family courtâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361&nbsp;(2005).Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides fifteen factors for the family court to consider when apportioning marital property, and it is within the family courtâ€™s discretion to determine how much weight to give each of these factors.Â  On appeal, even if this court might have weighed specific factors differently, we will affirm the family courtâ€™s apportionment so long as it is fair overall.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nIn making its decision to award Husband the bulk of the marital estate, the family court focused on the partiesâ€™ financial contributions to the marriage.Â  Specifically, the family court found: \r\n\r\nIt appears Husband has contributed 99%, or thereabouts, of the funds into this marriage.Â  On the other hand, without objection by Husband, Wife contributed through her services as a homemaker.Â  She also, for a period of time, assisted Husband in one of his business ventures serving as his bookkeeper/secretary.Â  Wife also assisted in overseeing the building and selling of several homes during the marriage.Â  Wife did physical work in and around the home and houses built for resale during the marriage and, as mentioned, maintained the home.Â  Wife was frugal, buying most items â€œon sale.â€Â  Husband indicated he completely trusted Wifeâ€™s handling of finances during the marriage.\r\n\r\nDespite the family courtâ€™s recognition of Wifeâ€™s contributions as a homemaker, the family court divided the marital estate in such a way that Husband received over one-and-a-half times the amount of property Wife received.Â  Because the court specifically found neither party to be at fault for the coupleâ€™s separation, this uneven division must have been based almost exclusively on the partiesâ€™ direct financial contributions to their accumulation of wealth.Â  \r\nIn our recent case of Doe v. Doe, (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 3, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 26 at 78), which involved a marriage of over thirty years, we found the family court abused its discretion by awarding Husband seventy percent of the marital estate, despite Husband having been the primary breadwinner in the family.Â  We stated: â€œWhile there is certainly no recognized presumption in favor of a fifty-fifty division, we approve equal division as an appropriate starting point for a family court judge attempting to divide an estate of a long-term marriage.â€Â  Id. at 83 (citing Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina (3rd ed. 2001 and Supp. 2005)).Â  A fifty-fifty starting point is appropriate, we went on to explain, because in many long-term marriages, the spouses have an agreed-upon arrangement whereby one spouse works outside the home and is the primary wage earner while the other spouse makes little or no money but provides a valuable service in maintaining the household.Â  Under these circumstances, â€œit would be unfair to the spouse who undertook household duties for the family court to apportion the marital estate solely based on the partiesâ€™ direct financial contributions.â€Â  Id. at 84 (citing Walker v. Walker, 295 S.C. 286, 288, 368 S.E.2d 89, 90 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œEquitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership.â€)).Â  \r\nThat is not to say that all long term marriages ending in divorce will necessarily have estates that are divided equally.Â  The family court is charged with looking at all fifteen factors of section 20-7-472, and may give one party a larger portion of the estate based on the circumstances of each case.Â  For instance, although we reversed the seventy-thirty split in Doe, we modified the award to a sixty-forty division because Wifeâ€™s adultery caused the marriageâ€™s dissolution.Â  \r\nIn the case before us, however, we cannot discern any special circumstances tilting the equitable division scale in favor of one spouse.Â  This was a lengthy marriage wherein the parties agreed to a traditional breadwinner/homemaker arrangement.Â  With such an arrangement, both parties made significant, albeit different, contributions to the acquisition, preservation, depreciation, and appreciation in value of their marital property.Â Â  Neither party was at fault for the separation, nor does either party earn a significant income.[2]Â  Although Husband suffered a heart attack in October of 2002, he testified that most of his medical expenses are paid through Medicare.Â  The parties are not likely to pursue careers for which they will need additional training or education, and neither party has significant non-marital property.Â  Finally, neither party has support obligations, though Wife does provide clothing to her disabled daughter.Â  \r\nConsidering the circumstances of this case, we find the family court abused its discretion by awarding twenty-five percent more of the marital estate to Husband.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the 62.5-37.5 split and remand the case so that the marital estate can be divided equally between the spouses.\r\nB. Alimony \r\nWife argues the family court erred in denying her alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to award alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005). When awarding alimony, the family court considers the following thirteen factors set forth in section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005) of the South Carolina Code: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other relevant factors the court considers relevant.\r\nIn its final order, the family court specifically stated it â€œconsidered all applicable factors in [Â§ 20-3-130].â€Â  After considering those factors, the family court declined to award Wife alimony because Husband had very little income to speak of and Wife would receive a substantial sum in the equitable division. Â In our opinion today, we increase the amount of property Wife receives in the equitable division.Â  Considering this equal division of the marital estate and Husbandâ€™s meager income, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wife alimony.\r\nC. Valuation of Jewelry and Mink Coat \r\nWife argues the family court erred in valuing her jewelry at $40,000.Â  Specifically, she contends the family court (1) failed to specify which pieces of jewelry were included in the marital estate, and (2) erred by using the jewelryâ€™s insurance value to determine its fair market value.Â  She further argues the family court erred in valuing her twenty-year-old mink coat at $8,000.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court is charged with identifying the marital property and determining the propertyâ€™s fair market value.Â  Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A family courtâ€™s valuation determination will be affirmed on appeal if the valuation is within the range of values presented by the parties.Â  Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 412, 416 (Ct. App. 1987). \r\nAt trial, Wife submitted an appraisal, which listed seven pieces of jewelry valued at $2,900.Â  Wife testified she had other, less expensive jewelry at home that was worth a total of $300.Â  Husband, who claimed there were twelve pieces of jewelry purchased during the marriage, valued the jewelry at over $50,000.Â  In support of his valuation, Husband submitted an insurance document, listing twelve pieces of jewelry that were insured for $40,305.Â  Husband also submitted numerous appraisals from 1987 through 2001 that supported, and in some cases exceeded, the values listed on the insurance documents.Â  Additionally, Husband testified that he purchased an Ebel watch for Wife during their marriage and that the watch was worth $4,000.\r\nIn its order, the family court valued Wifeâ€™s jewelry at $40,000, explaining: â€œI have discounted the value of Wifeâ€™s engagement ring and am using, essentially, the value the parties have utilized for insurance purpose for a number of years.â€Â  In so ruling, it is clear the family court included all pieces of jewelry testified to, with the exception of Wifeâ€™s engagement ring.Â  Considering the evidence presented by the parties, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in valuing the jewelry at $40,000, a figure within the range of values presented by the parties.Â Â Â  See id.\r\nAs for the mink coat, Wife testified that its fair market value is $1,000.Â  Husband testified its value was $8,000, and submitted into evidence a document showing that as the amount for which the coat was insured.Â Â Â  While we recognize that an itemâ€™s insurance value may be higher than its fair market value, the family court judge only had two values offered to him: one from Wife, which was unsupported by documentation, and one from Husband, which was supported by the partiesâ€™ decision to insure the coat for $8,000.Â  Under these circumstances, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to adopt Husbandâ€™s estimation of the coatâ€™s fair market value.Â Â Â  See id.; cf. Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œ[A] party cannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to this Court complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the family courtâ€™s findings.â€). \r\nD. Attorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nLastly, Wife argues the family court erred in failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial condition of each party; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch,&nbsp;367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648-49 (2006).Â  The family courtâ€™s decision regarding attorneyâ€™s fees will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 353, 465 S.E.2d 130, 134&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nIn light of our decision today, the partiesâ€™ ability to pay attorneyâ€™s fees, the results obtained by counsel, their respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on their standard of living are virtually equal.Â  Thus, we agree with the family courtâ€™s decision requiring each to pay his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nII. Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nHusband first argues the family court erred in failing to include in the marital estate $54,000 Wife added to a bank CD and $64,000 Wife had in a checking account with her aunt.Â  We disagree.\r\nBoth Wife and aunt testified that the funds in the CD and checking account belonged exclusively to aunt.Â  While Husband called into question how aunt had accumulated such large amounts of money, the family court ultimately found Wife and aunt to be credible, and declined to include the money in the partiesâ€™ marital estate.Â  Because we defer to the family court on issues of witnessesâ€™ credibility, we find no reversible error in the refusal to include these accounts in the marital estate.Â  See Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623&nbsp;(2003).\r\nNext, Husband argues the family court erred by including in the marital estate a $71,500 money market account he claims contained the money he inherited when his mother died.Â  We note the family court did not rule on whether these particular funds derived from Husbandâ€™s inheritance.Â  Rather, it found the money should be included in the marital estate because Husband divested himself of it while the parties were contemplating separation.Â  Husband filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, requesting a ruling on this issue, but again, the family court did not rule on it.Â  Therefore, we remand the issue to the family court to make a finding as to whether the funds Husband divested to his children during the partiesâ€™ separation were the funds he inherited after his mother passed away.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court erred in awarding Husband 62.5 percent of the marital estate; we modify the division to a fifty-fifty split; and, we remand the actual division of the property to the family court.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s valuation of Wifeâ€™s jewelry and mink coat, its refusal to award Wife alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees, and its refusal to include $54,000 from a CD and $64,000 from a checking account owned by Wifeâ€™s aunt.Â  Finally, we remand the issue of whether the $71,500 CD that Husband divested to his children during separation was non-marital, inherited funds. Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] With interest over the years, Husband testified that his $51,660 inheritance had grown to $71,500.\r\n[2] According to Husbandâ€™s financial declaration, he receives $2,040 per month from social security and other pensions.Â  Wifeâ€™s financial declaration indicates she receives $400 per month from social security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4148","title":"Metts v.

Kerr, of Charleston for Appellants-Respondents.\r\nEdward Paul Gibson, of North Charleston and Steve Frederick DeAntonio, of Charleston, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this action for libel, Robert Metts, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of Berkley County, appeals the order of the circuit court granting Berkley Independent Publishing and Summerville Communications (Newspaper) summary judgment.Â  Additionally, Newspaper appeals from the order requiring it to produce financial information, and Metts appeals from an order declining to impose sanctions upon Newspaper after it refused to comply with the discovery order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 30, 2003, Newspaper published an article entitled â€œIt was helpful, but was it legal?â€Â  The story centered around a controversial work policy established by Mettsâ€™s boss, County Supervisor Jim Rozier, which allowed county employees to perform yard work on private property.Â  The article questioned whether the policy violated the state constitution.Â  According to the article, county council member Judy Mims stated: â€œ[A] constituent called [her] . . . about seeing county trucks in Robbie Mettsâ€™ driveway in Pinopolis, and employees cutting limbs from trees in his yard.â€Â  \r\nOn the day Newspaper published the article, Mims called the reporter who wrote the story and claimed she had not made the statement which the article attributed to her.Â  Although the reporter still believed Mims made the statement, Newspaper agreed to print a correction.Â  The correction stated: â€œMrs. Mims told The Independent she would like to correct [the previous statement] to say that constituents told her they had seen county trucks in [Mettsâ€™s] yard.â€Â  The correction further stated that â€œMetts told The Independent that what was reported â€˜was not the least bit accurate.â€™â€Â  Metts was extremely upset by the articleâ€™s implication he was utilizing county employees without paying the county a fee for the services.Â  Â \r\nMetts brought suit against Newspaper and Mims alleging libel, civil conspiracy, and invasion of privacy.Â  The complaint sought actual and punitive damages.Â  During discovery, Metts served Newspaper with a request for production of its financial records.Â  Newspaper refused to produce the documents on the ground that the records were only relevant to the issue of punitive damages, which Newspaper considered would most probably not go to a jury.Â  In response to Mettsâ€™s motion to compel, Judge Deadra Jefferson ordered Newspaper to produce the financial information.Â  \r\nNewspaper continued to refuse to produce its financial records, so Metts moved to have Newspaper held in contempt.Â  Before the contempt hearing was held, Newspaper filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Metts was a public official and there was no evidence Newspaper acted with constitutional malice in publishing the article.Â  \r\nJudge R. Markely Dennis, Jr., presided over the motion hearing.Â  Newspaper contended that it was unlikely the financial records would ever be needed because Metts could not prove constitutional malice.Â  Newspaper maintained that if it complied with the discovery order it would lose its right to appeal because the issue would be moot.Â  Newspaper, therefore, believed it had no choice but to have the court find it in contempt so it could appeal the order.Â  Judge Dennis agreed, finding Newspaper had the right to challenge the order.Â  Accordingly, Judge Dennis held Newspaper in contempt but imposed no sanctions.[1]Â  At the hearing, Judge Dennis also orally held Newspaperâ€™s motion for summary judgment in abeyance until the contempt issue was resolved.Â  Judge Dennis changed his mind, however, and issued a formal written order allowing Newspaper to proceed with its motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nThereafter, Judge Roger Young heard Newspaperâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Metts argued that Newspaper was aware of the adversarial relationship between Mims and Mettsâ€™s supervisor, Jim Rozier.Â  Further, Metts contended the reporter responsible for the article had received a government document listing the officials who had used county employees to perform lawn work at their houses, and that document did not have Mettsâ€™s name on it.Â  Therefore, Metts asserted that Newspaperâ€™s failure to investigate the story before publishing the article when the reporter had sufficient reason to doubt the veracity of Mimsâ€™s statement constituted actual malice.Â  For purposes of summary judgment, Newspaper conceded that Mimsâ€™s statement was false, but maintained the position that the reporter believed the statement to be true.Â  \r\nJudge Young found that in order for Metts to prevail on summary judgment, he needed to establish that Newspaper made the publication with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard as to the statementâ€™s truthfulness.Â  Taken in the light most favorable to Metts, Judge Young found no evidence suggested the reporter purposefully failed to investigate why Mettsâ€™s name was not included on the list.Â  Judge Young found Metts failed to establish clear and convincing evidence allowing a trier of fact to find that Newspaper was aware the contested quote was false, or that it acted with reckless disregard as to the truth of Mimsâ€™s allegations.Â  Accordingly, Judge Young granted Newspaperâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Both Newspaper and Metts appeal.Â  \r\nNewspaper argues the trial court erred in requiring it to produce private financial information without any evidentiary showing that Metts was entitled to it.Â  Â Â Metts appeals the circuit courtâ€™s failure to impose sanctions when Newspaper refused to comply with the discovery order.Â  Metts also claims the circuit court erred by allowing Newspaperâ€™s motion for summary judgment to proceed, after initially holding the matter in abeyance pending the contempt orderâ€™s appeal.Â  Finally, Metts appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Newspaperâ€™s motion for summary judgment on his defamation claim.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). \r\nOnce the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Peterson v. West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFirst, Metts argues the trial court erred in allowing Newspaperâ€™s motion for summary judgment to proceed after initially holding the summary judgment motion in abeyance pending the resolution of the contempt order.Â  We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina law is well-settled that until an order is entered by the clerk of court, the trial court retains control of the case.Â  See Upchurch v. Upchurch,&nbsp;367 S.C. 16, 22-23, 624 S.E.2d 643, 646&nbsp;(2006) (â€œAn order\r\nis not final until it is entered by the clerk of court; and until the order or judgment is entered by the clerk of the court, the judge retains control of the case.â€); Bowman v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 335 S.C. 88, 91, 515 S.E.2d 259, 260 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œAn order is not final until it is written and entered by the clerk of court.Â  Until an order is written and entered by the clerk of court, the judge\r\nretains discretion to change his mind and amend his ruling accordingly.â€).Â  Therefore, the oral ruling from the bench was not binding upon the parties.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by ordering the summary judgment motion to proceed.Â  In the interest of judicial economy, it made sense to allow the summary judgment motion to go forward because if the motion was resolved in favor of Newspaper, there would be no reason for Newspaper to produce its financial records to\r\nMetts. \r\nNext, Metts argues there is ample evidence in the record of Newspaperâ€™s actual malice and therefore the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.[2]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThere is no dispute that Metts, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of Berkley County, is a public figure.Â  In a defamation case involving a public figure or official, the complaining party must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, â€œactual malice,â€ i.e., that the defendant published the defamatory statement with either the knowledge it was false or with a reckless disregard as to whether it was false.Â  Anderson v. Augusta Chronicle, 365 S.C. 589, 619 S.E.2d 428 (2005) (citing George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 451, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001)).Â  \r\nIn deciding whether actual malice exists in a given case, we note â€˜â€œthe actual malice standard is not satisfied merely through a showing of ill will or â€˜maliceâ€™ in the ordinary sense of the term.â€â€™Â  George, 345 S.C. at 456, 548 S.E.2d at 866 (quoting Harte-Hanks Communications., Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 666 (1989)).Â  Further, as the South Carolina Supreme Court reiterated in Anderson, failure to investigate in and of itself is insufficient to establish that a defendant â€œâ€˜recklessly disregardedâ€™ the falsity of a published article.â€Â  365 S.C. at 598, 619 S.E.2d at 431.Â  See also George, 345 S.C. at 456, 548 S.E.2d 868 (â€œ[T]he reckless conduct contemplated by the New York Times standard â€˜is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing.â€™â€) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nRather, the actual malice standard is governed by a subjective standard that tests a defendantâ€™s good faith belief in the truth of the published statement.Â  Elder v. Gaffney Ledger, 341 S.C. 108, 114, 533 S.E.2d 899, 902 (2000).Â  Additionally, South Carolina has declined to impose rigorous investigatory duties for members of the press.Â  Anderson, 365 S.C. at 596, 619 S.E.2d at 431.Â  Therefore, in order to establish recklessness there must be an â€œextreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by reasonable publishers.â€Â  Id. (citing Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting, Inc., 324 S.C. 261, 266, 478 S.E.2d. 284, 285 (1997)).Â  The complaining party must show sufficient evidence to conclude that â€œthe defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.â€Â  St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968).Â  \r\nMetts argues the reporterâ€™s knowledge of the adversarial relationship between Mims and Mettsâ€™s supervisor, coupled with the fact that Mettsâ€™s name was not included in the official list of people who had county employees perform work at their homes put the reporter on notice that further inquiry into the matter was required.Â  Metts asserts the reporterâ€™s failure to investigate the conflicting information and instead, proceeding with publication establishes actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.Â Â Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Metts, the reporterâ€™s testimony reveals the following about her subjective belief about Mimsâ€™s statement:Â  (1) Mims made the statement to the reporter at 11:30 a.m.; (2) the reporter knew Mims and Rozier did not get along and that Metts worked for Rozier; and (3) the reporter believed she had no reason to doubt Mimsâ€™s statement because Mims was a county official speaking about a county policy.Â  The record also reveals that Newspaper received the official document at 4:30 p.m. and that the paper had been held from going to press until the list could be included in the publication.Â  \r\nWe hold the evidence yields only one conclusion â€“ that the reporter subjectively believed the truth of Mimsâ€™s statement.Â  Metts correctly argues that the subjective awareness of probable falsity can be shown â€œif there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.â€Â  Anderson, 365 S.C. at 596, 619 S.E.2d at 432 (emphasis added).Â  However, simply because the reporter was aware that Mims and Mettsâ€™s supervisor were political adversaries does not mean the reporter had obvious reasons to doubt Mimsâ€™s credibility as a source of information.Â Â  \r\nIn short, Mettsâ€™s claim of actual malice in this case hinges on the reporterâ€™s failure to investigate Mimsâ€™s story after receiving a document that apparently contradicted Mimsâ€™s statement.Â  Newspaper is a small weekly publication, and the evidence reveals the reporter received the list a few hours before the deadline for submitting final articles.Â  We agree with the circuit court that the evidence indicates the reporter failed to investigate due to time constraints and a number of other obligations, including numerous editorial and administrative tasks.Â  Although the reporterâ€™s actions may have been negligent, we cannot say that they constituted an extreme departure from the standards of investigation normally employed by publishers so as to rise to the level of constitutional actual malice.Â  See also Elder, 341 S.C. at 118-19, 533 S.E.2d at 904 (finding that failure to investigate an anonymous phone call prior to publishing plus testimony that editor possibly harbored some ill will toward plaintiff was â€œpatently insufficientâ€ to establish actual malice). \r\nBecause we find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Newspaper, we need not address any issues involving the contempt order.Â  See Jarrell v. Petoseed Co.,&nbsp;331 S.C. 207, 209-10, 500 S.E.2d 793, 794&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998) (â€œCivil contempt proceedings designed to coerce compliance generally terminate along with the termination of the main action.â€) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Judge Dennis also ruled Metts was a public official.Â  \r\n[2] For purposes of summary judgment, we will assume the statement was false and defamatory.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4149","title":"Guider v.

verdict in favor of LaToya Guider.Â  Churchâ€™s alleges the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motions, admitting testimony from Guiderâ€™s coworker, instructing the jury on punitive damages and breach of trust with fraudulent intent, and failing to deny or reduce actual and punitive damages.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nChurpeyes, Inc. owns a chain of restaurants, including a Churchâ€™s Chicken restaurant on Taylor Street in Columbia.Â  Guider worked as general manager of the Taylor Street restaurant in May 2003.Â  \r\nShortly before closing on the night of May 25, 2003, someone entered the restaurant through an unlocked rear door and robbed it of approximately $860.Â  The shift manager on duty, Selena Harrison, called Guider at home to inform her of the robbery.Â  Guider went to the restaurant, where she found police investigating the incident.Â  She contacted Churchâ€™s area manager, Jimmy Bailey, to inform him of the incident.Â  Bailey told Guider to let police continue their investigation and that he would discuss the matter with her later.Â  \r\nThe next day, Bailey met with Guider and told her that leaving the back door of the restaurant unlocked violated company policy, and that the employees who worked on the shift when the robbery occurred would be fired.Â  Guider protested the decision to terminate the employees as unfair, arguing the policy had never been enforced.Â  She also intervened on Harrisonâ€™s behalf with Jerome York, the Vice President of Operations for Churchâ€™s.Â  \r\nOn June 4, 2003, Guider received a paycheck from which $430 had been deducted.Â  Guider also received a document entitled â€œDeduction Contractâ€ that Bailey drafted with Yorkâ€™s approval.Â  The document styled itself as a â€œcontractâ€ between Guider and Churchâ€™s in which Guider agreed to have $859 deducted from two paychecks in installments of $430 and $429.Â  According to Bailey and York, the document represented an agreement reached with Guider in which she would reimburse Churchâ€™s for the money taken in the robbery.Â  In return, Churchâ€™s would not terminate Harrison.Â  Guider disputed reaching any such agreement, but nevertheless signed the Deduction Contract.[1]Â  \r\nGuider resigned the following morning.Â  Later that day, she took $1,004 cash from the restaurantâ€™s sales proceeds to deposit in Churchâ€™s bank account.Â  She presented the bank with a deposit slip indicating $1,004 was being deposited.Â  However, she only included $204 in cash with the deposit slip, and intentionally kept the remaining $800.Â  \r\nImmediately after leaving the bank, Guider returned to the restaurant and told Bailey, â€œI need to speak to you about my money.Â  I got my money back.â€Â  She did not specify that she had kept $800 of the money she was supposed to deposit, nor did she offer to return the money.Â  Bailey told Guider he was busy with customers and did not have time to talk to her.Â  Guider gathered her personal items and left.Â  Later that evening, Guider again spoke to Bailey after she called and paged him throughout the day.Â  She told him, â€œI did something that was wrong.Â  I took money out of that $1,004 deposit.â€Â  She added that she would like to meet and discuss returning the $800 to Churchâ€™s and receiving the money it withheld from her paycheck.Â  However, despite Guiderâ€™s repeated attempts to meet with Bailey regarding the money, he either ignored her calls or claimed he was too busy to meet with her.Â  \r\nOn June 11, 2003, Bailey asked police to issue an arrest warrant for Guider on breach of trust charges.Â  Six days had passed since Guider informed him that she kept part of the money she was supposed to deposit.Â  The arrest warrant affidavit provided by Bailey alleged Guider admittedly withheld the money she was entrusted to deposit for Churchâ€™s.Â  The affidavit further alleged Guider retained the money â€œfor her own personal use.â€Â  \r\nGuider eventually returned the money to Churchâ€™s by depositing the funds in the companyâ€™s bank account on June 13, 2003.Â  Â She had retained possession of the funds for eight days, during which time Churchâ€™s did not have access to the funds.Â  A municipal court judge signed the arrest warrant on June 19, 2003.Â  Police served Guider with the warrant on June 29, and arrested her on the charges.Â  The charges were dismissed the following day when Churchâ€™s failed to appear at Guiderâ€™s hearing.Â Â  \r\nThereafter, in October 2003, Guider initiated the present action alleging malicious prosecution, abuse of process, failure to pay wages, false arrest, and violation of Guiderâ€™s civil rights.Â  Guider voluntarily dismissed her civil rights claim before the trial.Â  The trial court dismissed the false arrest claim in pretrial proceedings.Â  \r\nThe matter proceeded to jury trial in November 2004.Â  The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $75,000 in actual damages and $100,000 in punitive damages on the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims.Â  Churchâ€™s made timely post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new trial nisi, and new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The trial court denied the motions.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, a court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999).Â  However, â€œthe appellate court should not ignore facts unfavorable to the opposing party.â€Â Â  Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 296, 504 S.E.2d 347, 350 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œRather, it must determine whether a verdict for the opposing party would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Id.Â  The issue must be submitted to a jury when material evidence tends to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997).Â  â€œHowever, this rule does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical\r\nand hypothetical views to the jury.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œ[W]hen only one reasonable inference can be deduced from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for the court.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict on Malicious Prosecution\r\nChurchâ€™s argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motion on Guiderâ€™s malicious prosecution claim because she failed to prove Churchâ€™s lacked probable cause to bring a breach of trust charge against her.Â  We agree.\r\nA plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action must show (1) institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings, either civil or criminal; (2) by, or at the insistence of, the defendant; (3) termination of such proceeding in plaintiffâ€™s favor; (4) malice in instituting such proceedings; (5) want of probable cause, and (6) resulting injury or damage.Â  Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co., 246 S.C. 318, 321, 143 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1965).Â  Churpeyes does not dispute its actions satisfy the first two prongs of this test.Â  Instead, it focuses its argument on the prong related to probable cause.[2]\r\nâ€œAn essential element of malicious prosecution is the institution of judicial proceedings without probable cause against the plaintiff.â€Â  Kinton v. Mobile Home Indus., Inc., 274 S.C. 179, 181, 262 S.E.2d 727, 728 (1980). â€œProbable cause in this context does not turn upon the plaintiffâ€™s guilt or innocence, but rather\r\nupon whether the facts within the prosecutorâ€™s knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe the plaintiff was guilty of the crimes charged.â€Â  Id.Â  When determining if probable cause exists, the court must consider the facts from the point of view of the party prosecuting.Â Â \r\nEaves v. Broad River Elec. Co-op., Inc., 277 S.C. 475, 478, 289 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1982).Â \r\nâ€œ[T]he question is not what the actual facts were, but what [the prosecuting party] honestly believed them to be.â€ Id.Â  \r\nLooking at the facts from Churchâ€™s point of view for the determination of probable cause, Churchâ€™s filed the breach of trust charges knowing Guider had admittedly retained $800 in company funds with which she had been entrusted on June 5, 2003.Â  Moreover, Guider retained possession of the $800 for a total of eight days before she returned the money to Churchâ€™s.Â  Churchâ€™s filed the charges after Guider told Bailey, â€œI got my money back,â€ â€œI did something that was wrong,â€ and â€œI took money out of that $1,004 deposit.â€Â  Guider had not returned the funds when the charges were filed.Â  \r\nA reasonable party could only conclude Churchâ€™s had probable cause to believe Guider guilty of breach of trust.Â  We find Guider failed to meet her burden of proving Churchâ€™s lacked probable cause to bring breach of trust charges against her.Â  See Parrott, 246 S.C. at 322, 143 S.E.2d at 609 (holding the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the person or entity bringing the charges lacked probable cause to pursue charges against him).Â  Thus, viewing these facts in the light most favorable to Guider, the trial court should have granted Churchâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the malicious prosecution charge as a matter of law.Â  Id. at 323, 143 S.E.2d at 609 (holding although the question of whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided as a matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Directed Verdict on Abuse of Process\r\nChurchâ€™s next argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motion on Guiderâ€™s abuse of process claim.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe abuse of process tort provides a remedy for one damaged by anotherâ€™s perversion of a legal procedure for a purpose not intended by the procedure.â€Â  Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Intâ€™l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 69, 567 S.E.2d 251, 253 (Ct. App. 2002). Â â€œThe essential elements of abuse of process are an ulterior purpose and a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the conduct of the proceeding.â€Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Intâ€™l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 429 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997).Â  â€œAn ulterior purpose exists if the process is used to gain an objective not legitimate in the use of the process.â€Â  First Union Mortgage Corp. v. Thomas, 317 S.C. 63, 74, 451 S.E.2d 907, 914 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œThe improper purpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself.â€Â  Hainer, 328 S.C. at 136, 492 S.E.2d at 107.Â  Regardless, â€œthere is no liability when the process has been carried to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions.â€Â  Thomas, 317 S.C. at 74-75, 451 S.E.2d at 914.Â  \r\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to Guider, we find the record devoid of evidence that Churchâ€™s misused the legal process or operated with an illegitimate purpose.Â  Instead, the evidence shows Churchâ€™s used the legal process with the objective of seeking redress against a former employee who admittedly took and retained company funds.Â  Moreover, when Guider returned the funds, Churchâ€™s stopped pursuing the criminal charges against her.Â  This is clearly a legitimate use, not a perversion, of the legal process.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court should have granted directed verdicts to Churchâ€™s on Guiderâ€™s claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.Â  Â For the forgoing reasons, the verdict in favor of Guider is \r\nREVERSED.[3]\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Guider challenged Churchâ€™s actions in a complaint she filed with the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (LLR) on June 11, 2003.Â  LLRâ€™s Office of Wages and Child Labor eventually found the Deduction Contract invalid and ordered Churchâ€™s to repay Guider the money it withheld from her paycheck.Â  \r\n[2] Churchâ€™s also briefly argues Guider failed to meet her burden of proving the remaining elements of malicious prosecution.Â  The issues of malice and damages were not raised in the directed verdict motion, and thus are not preserved for our review.Â  See Scoggins v. McClellion, 321 S.C. 264, 267, 468 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding issues not raised in directed verdict motion unpreserved for appellate review).Â  \r\n[3] Because we reverse on this issue, we decline to address Churchâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
