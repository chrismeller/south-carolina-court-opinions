(Mother), an inmate at the\r\n  Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution, appeals the family court's\r\n  denial of her motion for a continuance when the Department of Corrections (the\r\n  Department) failed to transport\r\n  Mother to a judicial review hearing despite a court order finding Mother was a\r\n  &quot;necessary and proper party.&quot;Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  April 27, 2007, Mother and Carmen C. (Child), then two years and four months\r\n  old, tested positive for cocaine.Â  According to the guardian ad litem (GAL),\r\n  Child ingested drugs that Mother had purchased.Â  As a result, Child was taken\r\n  into emergency protective custody, and on May 9, 2007, the family court granted\r\n  the Department of Social Services (DSS) custody of Child.Â  Thereafter, Mother\r\n  stipulated, without admission, that she physically neglected Child, and\r\n  therefore, Child had been abused or neglected.Â  On October 2, 2007, the family\r\n  court issued a removal order and ordered Mother complete a treatment plan.Â  Previously,\r\n  findings were made against Jerome C. (Father), and he was ordered to complete a\r\n  treatment plan as well. The family\r\n  court's order deferred deciding permanency planning and the issue of Mother's\r\n  payment of child support.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 8, 2008, the family court held a hearing and found Father had\r\n  substantially complied with his treatment plan, but Mother had not.Â  As a\r\n  result, the family court issued an order for permanency planning, placing Child\r\n  in Father's custody.Â  The family court stated Father's custody of Child shall\r\n  not affect Mother's ability to complete her treatment plan, and it ordered DSS\r\n  to continue supervising visits between Mother and Child.Â  A judicial review was\r\n  scheduled for six months following Father's taking custody of Child.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Mother was incarcerated.Â  As a result, the family court ordered the Department\r\n  to transport Mother to the June 27, 2008 judicial review hearing because Mother\r\n  was a &quot;necessary and proper party.&quot;Â  Â Â Although the order of\r\n  transport was faxed to the Department, the Department failed to transport\r\n  Mother to the hearing.Â  When the hearing began, Mother's counsel moved for a\r\n  continuance, arguing: &quot;I hate for this hearing to proceed without [Mother]\r\n  through no fault of her own, and, in fact, despite the court order is not\r\n  present.&quot;Â  The family court responded: \r\n\r\n\tWell, I\r\n  want to respond to your statement that she is not here, that it's not her fault\r\n  that she is not.Â  She did get herself put in prison.Â  So to the extent that she\r\n  is not able to physically move about as she would like to, she is responsible\r\n  for that. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, the family\r\n  court denied her motion.[1] Â Â \r\nThe family\r\n  court then issued a written order finding Mother responsible for the fact that\r\n  she was not present at the hearing through her own criminal actions, and\r\n  ordered Child to remain in Father's custody.Â  Additionally, the family court\r\n  stated Father was responsible for arranging and supervising Mother's visitation\r\n  with Child, andÂ  that visitation should not occur at Mother's or Father's\r\n  residence.Â  Lastly, the family court closed the case, stating should Mother\r\n  wish to seek custody of Child in the future, Mother must file a private action\r\n  with the family court.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother appeals, arguing she was deprived of meaningful access to\r\n  the court when the Department failed to transport Mother to the hearing as\r\n  ordered by the family court and the family court denied Mother's motion for a\r\n  continuance.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nRule 40 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  provides &quot;[i]f good and sufficient cause for continuance is shown, the\r\n  continuance may be granted by the court.&quot; The grant or denial of a\r\n  continuance is within the sound discretion of the family court and its ruling\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Broome,Â  307 S.C. 48, 51, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838&nbsp;(1992).Â \r\n  Whether a family court abuses its discretion depends upon the facts before it at\r\n  the time.Â  Grant v. Grant, 288 S.C. 86, 89, 340 S.E.2d 791,\r\n  793&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  The denial of a motion for a continuance &quot;will\r\n  not be upset unless it clearly appears that there was an abuse of discretion to\r\n  the prejudice of appellant.&quot;Â  Williams v. Bordon's, Inc., 274 S.C.\r\n  275, 279, 262 S.E.2d 881, 883&nbsp;(1980).Â  &quot;It is fundamental that\r\n  '[p]risoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts.'&quot;Â  Kocaya\r\n    v. Kocaya, 347 S.C. 26, 29, 552 S.E.2d 765, 767&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821 (1977)).Â  In Kocaya, this\r\n  court recognized that while no statute expressly requires the Department to\r\n  transport prisoners to court under section 24-1-130 of the South Carolina Code,\r\n  the Department's director is responsible for the &quot;proper care . . . and\r\n  management of the prisoners confined&quot; within the prison system.Â  347 S.C.\r\n  at 29, 552 S.E.2d at 767.Â  The Kocaya court concluded the director's\r\n  responsibilities include a duty to transport a prisoner to court, criminal or\r\n  civil, when so directed by a court order.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court has the authority to order a prisoner transported from the\r\n  prisoner's place of confinement to the family court.Â  Id. at 30, 552\r\n  S.E.2d at 767.Â  The family court is statutorily authorized &quot;[to] send\r\n  process and any other mandates in any matter in which it has jurisdiction into\r\n  any county of the State for service or execution&quot; and &quot;[t]o compel\r\n  the attendance of witnesses.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(28) &amp; (29)\r\n  (2008).Â  Further, one family court judge may not ignore an order of another family\r\n  court judge.Â  See Cook v. Taylor, 272 S.C. 536, 538, 252 S.E.2d\r\n  923, 924&nbsp;(1979) (finding when one circuit court judge vacates an order of\r\n  reference by another circuit judge this amounts to a review of the order of\r\n  another circuit judge and the second judge does not have the power to set aside\r\n  the order of another judge); see also Enoree Baptist Church v.\r\n    Fletcher, 287 S.C. 602, 603, 340 S.E.2d 546, 547 (1986) (finding a circuit\r\n  court judge cannot deny the use of an amended complaint in light of an order of another circuit court judge\r\n  that permitted use of the amended complaint).\r\nWe hold the family court erred in denying Mother's motion for a\r\n  continuance because Judge Anderson ordered Mother be transported to the\r\n  hearing.Â  The family court's reliance on Mother's incarceration preventing her\r\n  from being present at the hearing is misplaced; Mother was entitled to be\r\n  present at the hearing under Judge Anderson's order of transport.Â  Mother would have been present at the hearing but for\r\n  the Department's failure to transport Mother.Â  The effect of the family court's refusal to grant Mother's\r\n  motion for a continuance denied Mother, a necessary and proper party, Â meaningful\r\n  access to this State's courts.Â  Therefore, we reverse the family court's order\r\n  and remand the matter for another judicial review hearing with Mother present.Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON, A.J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Judge Georgia V. Anderson\r\n  issued the order of transport, and Judge Robert E. Guess presided over the\r\n  judicial review hearing.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4635","title":"State v.

We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn the night of August 26, 2004, Brian\r\n  D. was on the porch outside his home with his friend, Christopher, when several\r\n  boys came around the corner and asked them if there were any &quot;Slobs&quot;\r\n  around there.[1]Â \r\n  Brian and Christopher responded they had not seen any, and did not know.Â  Brian\r\n  saw the boys walk off behind the house, at which time he went inside his home\r\n  and told his step-father, Teddy, that something &quot;didn't look right.&quot;Â \r\n  Brian stepped back outside and started talking to Christopher.Â  As Brian began\r\n  to re-enter his home, he heard shooting and ran inside the house.Â  Courtney D.,\r\n  Brian's sister, and Terrence M. were in the front yard at that time.Â  After the\r\n  shots rang out, Brian heard Christopher say that Courtney and Terrance had been\r\n  shot.\r\nTeddy testified he and Courtney were\r\n  inside the house when Brian went outside and started talking to his friend on\r\n  the porch.Â  Courtney told her father she needed to get something from a friend's\r\n  house.Â  Brian came inside and told Teddy that something did not look right.Â \r\n  Brian stepped back outside, followed by Courtney a few seconds later.Â  Just\r\n  seconds after that, Brian &quot;jumped in the door&quot; and Teddy heard\r\n  gunshots.Â  Realizing his daughter had just walked out the door, Teddy went\r\n  outside to find Courtney was not moving and had blood coming from her head.Â  He\r\n  glanced to his right and saw Terrence out there too.Â  Twelve year-old Courtney\r\n  and sixteen year-old Terrence subsequently died from their gunshot wounds.\r\nOn the same day, but prior to the\r\n  shooting of Courtney and Terrence, at least two other incidents occurred on\r\n  T.S. Martin Drive where Courtney lived. Â The first situation involved Brady B.,\r\n  who drove his white Ford Escort down this street with Travis W., Travis B.,\r\n  Demetrius B., and Paris A. in the car.Â  The boys in the white Escort had an\r\n  unfriendly encounter with a male in the neighborhood, and words having\r\n  gang-related undertones were exchanged.[2]Â \r\n  Brady drove away from the situation, and subsequently went to a parking lot at\r\n  Bethel Bishop Apartments with Paris.\r\nWhile at Bethel Bishop, Brady and Paris\r\n  spoke to some of the people outside.Â  Brady testified he, Paris, and Carl\r\n  Smith, also known as Pooh, were joined by Praylow.Â  Pooh, who was a member of\r\n  the same gang as Appellant, the Folk Nation Gang, testified he, Paris, and\r\n  Brady were joined by someone named Sherod,[3] and that they drove back to T.S. Martin looking for a person named Delshawn.Â \r\n  Pooh testified Brady and Paris had indicated to the others they had a problem\r\n  and wanted to go fight.\r\nAccording to Brady, they turned down\r\n  T.S. Martin and saw a young girl, about twelve years-old.Â  Brady asked her if\r\n  she knew the boy they had encountered earlier and the girl cussed at them. Â They\r\n  told the girl to go back in her house.Â  They turned around and drove back down\r\n  the street, parked the car and exited the vehicle.Â  The group walked up the\r\n  street, but everyone in the neighborhood began closing their doors.Â  There was\r\n  no one outside, so they walked back to the car and drove away.Â  After leaving\r\n  T.S. Martin this second time, Brady stated he did not return to the location\r\n  again, and denied being there during the shooting.Â  He further testified, to\r\n  his knowledge, no one in his group had a gun during this encounter.\r\nPooh testified when they exited the car\r\n  at T.S. Martin, he was wearing a black bandana around his head, signifying the\r\n  Folk Nation Gang.Â  As they were looking for Delshawn, a female called out Pooh's\r\n  name as they crossed the street.[4]Â \r\n  The others began walking around, but Pooh called them back, realizing that if\r\n  they jumped someone at that time he would be the one caught since the female\r\n  recognized him.[5]Â \r\n  They got back in the car, and Brady dropped Pooh and Sherod off at Bethel Bishop.\r\nAccording to Pooh, he first saw Appellant\r\n  that night coming out of Bayberry Apartments, located right behind Bethel\r\n  Bishop.Â  Appellant was accompanied by Pooh's deaf friend, Goo, and two other\r\n  individuals Pooh did not know.Â  Pooh explained to appellant what had happened\r\n  at T.S. Martin and appellant told Pooh someone from T.S. Martin &quot;had run\r\n  him out there a couple of days before.&quot;Â  Appellant then showed Pooh three\r\n  or four .22 caliber bullets and said he &quot;might go on a lick.&quot;Â \r\n  Appellant also told Pooh he had just obtained a .22 caliber gun.Â  Appellant\r\n  kept telling Pooh he was about to go back to T.S. Martin, but Pooh asked\r\n  appellant not to, fearing that if anything occurred he would be the person\r\n  suspected, as the female had called out his name earlier.Â  Appellant then told\r\n  Pooh he was going to walk Goo home and probably was not &quot;going to go up\r\n  there.&quot;\r\nDiego T., who was seventeen years-old at\r\n  the time of trial, testified regarding his role in the incidents that occurred\r\n  that night.Â  Diego testified he ran into appellant, who went by the name Baby\r\n  Jesus, at Bethel Bishop Apartments as it started to get dark.Â  Appellant told\r\n  Diego he had to go handle something at T.S. Martin, and asked Diego to go with\r\n  him.Â  Diego agreed, and as they walked they met up with Ty, Goo, and Little\r\n  Chris.Â  After appellant had a conversation with these three, they also agreed\r\n  to accompany him to T.S. Martin.Â  As they walked through Bethel Bishop they saw\r\n  Pooh, and appellant had a conversation with Pooh.Â  Pooh told them to be careful\r\n  &quot;because they had pulled some guns on some Slobs.&quot;\r\nIt was nighttime and dark when the five\r\n  of them, appellant, Diego, Ty, Goo, and Little Chris, walked over to T.S.\r\n  Martin.Â  Appellant put a black &quot;flag,&quot; or bandana, around his neck,\r\n  indicating he was representing his set, the Folk Nation Gang.Â  As they arrived\r\n  there, Little Chris asked a boy sitting on a porch if he was a &quot;Slob.&quot;Â \r\n  The boy responded that there was &quot;no gang banging&quot; around there.Â  The\r\n  boy then got on the phone, at which time Diego told the rest of them it was\r\n  time to go, as he believed the boy was calling the police or other boys to come\r\n  over there.Â  Appellant responded that he wanted him to call his boys.Â  At that\r\n  point, Diego saw appellant pull out a .22 rifle.Â  When appellant pulled out the\r\n  gun, he was across the street from the house where they saw the boy on the\r\n  porch.Â  Diego told them it was time to leave and he started to back away.Â  He\r\n  then saw Goo with a &quot;shotgun at his hand&quot; and appellant sign to Goo\r\n  to shoot at the house.Â  After appellant pointed the rifle at the house, Ty, Goo\r\n  and Little Chris started running away and Diego heard gunshots.Â  When he looked\r\n  back, he saw appellant throw down the rifle and pick up the shotgun and point\r\n  it. However, he did not hear any more shots. Â Appellant eventually caught up\r\n  with them, and Diego saw appellant wrap the guns and place them under a log.[6]Â \r\n  Some weeks thereafter, appellant called Diego and asked him to get the guns from\r\n  under the log and move them.Â  However, Diego did not do so because he knew\r\n  someone else had already moved them.Â  The only person Diego observed pointing\r\n  the .22 rifle or shooting that night was appellant.Â  Diego described appellant\r\n  as wearing two shirts, one black and the other white, along with long, black\r\n  Dickey shorts and a pair of black and white shoes on that night.\r\nShante B., who was also a member of the\r\n  Folk Nation Gang, testified to her encounter that night with appellant and\r\n  Pooh.Â  Shante was standing in front of a building at Bethel Bishop when\r\n  appellant told her he was going to T.S. Martin to &quot;ride with some Slobs.&quot;Â \r\n  Pooh told appellant not to go over there.Â  Appellant left the area with Goo,\r\n  Mirage and Diego.Â  A little while later, Shante saw appellant running back to\r\n  Bethel Bishop from the woods in the direction of T.S. Martin &quot;at full\r\n  speed.&quot;Â  Shante overheard appellant telling one of his friends he had just\r\n  left T.S. Martin, that he was &quot;spraying&quot; when he was shooting, and\r\n  that two little kids were shot.Â  Appellant stated he had done this because\r\n  earlier in the evening &quot;they had got in something with some Bloods.&quot;Â \r\n  Appellant then ran away from Bethel Bishop.\r\nAfter the second incident, where the\r\n  boys drove back to T.S. Martin in Brady's car looking to fight the individual\r\n  they previously encountered, the police were called.Â  Officer Reynolds was\r\n  dispatched to T.S. Martin at 9:11 p.m. on August 26, 2004, in regard to a civil\r\n  disturbance.Â  After being informed that some irate black males in a small white\r\n  vehicle had come to the area looking for someone named &quot;Delshawn,&quot;\r\n  Officer Reynolds, along with another policeman who responded to the call, left\r\n  the neighborhood to find Delshawn and see if he could identify the people\r\n  involved.Â  The officers spoke with Delshawn for ten to fifteen minutes, and\r\n  upon leaving received a call at 9:44 regarding another disturbance on T.S.\r\n  Martin.Â  The dispatch then immediately changed to a &quot;shots fired&quot;\r\n  call at the location.Â  Officer Reynolds testified he was able to get back to\r\n  T.S. Martin in about three or four minutes, and when he arrived he observed two\r\n  individuals on the ground and a lot of people in the yard.Â  Those standing\r\n  there began yelling to him that the suspects had run behind the house, in the\r\n  direction of Beltline.\r\nSergeant Auld also responded to the 9:44\r\n  p.m. shots fired dispatch, and heard over the radio that the subjects were\r\n  running toward the railroad track.Â  Sergeant Auld and Officer Whittle proceeded\r\n  to the bottom of a cut, went over some railroad tracks, and as they reached the\r\n  top of a mound, they heard crashing noises in the woods.Â  Using a flashlight,\r\n  they spotted appellant running out of the woods and commanded him to stop.Â \r\n  Other individuals who could be heard in the woods took off in another\r\n  direction.Â  The officers placed appellant in handcuffs and detained him in\r\n  Officer Whittle's vehicle. Investigator Gray then brought a witness to the\r\n  site, and Officer Whittle removed appellant from his car and used his\r\n  flashlight to shine on appellant for the witness to observe him.Â  Officer\r\n  Whittle described appellant as wearing a pair of gray shorts over a pair of\r\n  dark blue basketball shorts, a white t-shirt, and black and white tennis shoes\r\n  that night. \r\nAfter arriving at the scene of the\r\n  incident, Investigator Gray interviewed witness Tyrone S., who informed Gray he\r\n  had observed the shooting.Â  Tyrone indicated there was only one shooter, and\r\n  identified the person by his nickname.Â  Upon hearing a possible suspect had\r\n  been detained, Gray drove Tyrone to the location of the detention, pulled about\r\n  twenty feet behind the car holding the suspect, and turned on his high beam\r\n  lights.Â  Officer Whittle removed the suspect from his car and had the person\r\n  face Investigator Gray's vehicle for a few minutes.Â  Based upon the\r\n  identification process, Gray requested Whittle transport appellant to police\r\n  headquarters.Â  Thereafter, Gray interviewed appellant.Â  When told he had been\r\n  identified as being involved in a shooting at T.S. Martin, appellant initially\r\n  denied having been there.Â  When told he had been placed at T.S. Martin at the time\r\n  of the shooting, appellant then stated he had been at T.S. Martin &quot;earlier&quot;\r\n  and &quot;one of the dark skinned dudes&quot; was shooting at a house.Â \r\n  Appellant denied that he shot a gun that night.Â  Approximately twelve hours\r\n  later, and after a gunshot residue test had been performed on appellant,[7] appellant gave another statement.Â  This time he stated he had been firing a gun\r\n  on the night in question, but claimed it was a .32 caliber gun, he only had two\r\n  bullets, and that he shot at a top window of a house with a round hole like an\r\n  attic, situated on the corner.Â  Authorities were unable to discover any bullet\r\n  holes in the only home in the area with an attic vent, or any damage to any\r\n  homes in the area other than Courtney's home.\r\nTyrone S. testified regarding his\r\n  witness of the shooting and the events surrounding it.Â  Tyrone saw appellant at\r\n  an apartment complex around 3:00 in the afternoon on August 26, 2004.Â  Tyrone\r\n  was with Delshawn, a member of the Bloods Gang.Â  Tyrone did not speak with\r\n  appellant, but he observed a conversation take place between Delshawn and\r\n  appellant that he did not hear.Â  Tyrone and Delshawn then went back to T.S.\r\n  Martin where Tyrone lived.Â  A little after 9:00 that evening, Delshawn, who did\r\n  not live on T.S. Martin, left Tyrone's home. After his departure, Tyrone\r\n  received a call from Courtney wherein she relayed that some boys had asked her\r\n  where the &quot;Slobs&quot; stayed.Â  Tyrone went outside to talk to Courtney.Â \r\n  He observed some boys exit a car onto T.S. Martin.Â  Someone from the car had\r\n  yelled, &quot;There goes Delshawn,&quot; referring to Tyrone.Â  One of the boys,\r\n  who had braids, was wearing a light t-shirt and a black bandana covering half\r\n  of his face.Â  This person, who was two houses up as Tyrone stood on his porch,\r\n  pointed a gun at Tyrone and said he was going to kill him.Â  He then stated, &quot;That\r\n  ain't Delshawn,&quot; and turned and walked away, at which point Tyrone ran\r\n  into his house, and someone in his house called the police.Â  After telling the\r\n  officers the boys were looking for Delshawn, the police left to find Delshawn\r\n  themselves.Â  At the time, Tyrone did not know who the person was with the\r\n  bandana, but he later told the police he thought it was appellant.Â  Tyrone\r\n  testified this same white vehicle had come into their neighborhood earlier that\r\n  day.Â  At that time, they rode down the street and started saying, &quot;Come\r\n  down here,&quot; speaking to Delshawn.Â  As they were riding past, Delshawn and\r\n  Tyrone were throwing up gang signs to them.\r\nAfter the police left to look for\r\n  Delshawn, Tyrone was sitting on the porch with his two female cousins and one\r\n  of their friends when they saw five males walking up from the front of the\r\n  neighborhood.Â  Appellant was walking in the front of the group, and he was the\r\n  only one who was not wearing a bandana around his face.Â  Tyrone and the others\r\n  ran into the house and cut off the indoor house lights when they saw the boys.Â \r\n  Tyrone ran upstairs to a window.Â  A motion detector light on the house where\r\n  the boys were standing, as well as a street light located a little bit down the\r\n  street, provided light.Â  From his position in the upstairs window, Tyrone saw\r\n  appellant get a rifle and then provide a revolver to another person.Â  Appellant\r\n  then knelt down, aimed, started shooting, stood up, and then continued\r\n  shooting.Â  After the first shot was fired, all the other boys ran away.Â  Tyrone\r\n  heard multiple shots, and someone in his house called the police to return to\r\n  T.S. Martin.Â  Appellant was in the street when he was shooting.Â  Appellant\r\n  tried to shoot again, but was unsuccessful. He then turned around and ran away\r\n  in the same direction as the other boys.Â  Tyrone estimated he watched from the\r\n  upstairs window for a period of four to five minutes.\r\nTyrone spoke with Investigator Gray at\r\n  the scene and told him what he had observed and identified the shooter by his\r\n  nickname.Â  Gray then transported Tyrone to another location about four or five\r\n  miles away, where Tyrone identified appellant as the shooter.\r\nThe State also presented testimony from\r\n  two individuals qualified as experts in the field of gang activity and/or gang\r\n  recognition.Â  Both experts testified generally regarding several gangs with a\r\n  presence in South Carolina, as well as to the meaning of certain tattoos and\r\n  brands on the body of appellant, affiliating appellant with the Folk Nation\r\n  Gang and possibly indicating he had &quot;bodies&quot; attributed to him.Â \r\n  Additionally, the experts testified the Bloods and the Folk Nation did not &quot;get\r\n  along,&quot; and are considered rival groups.\r\nPrecious D. also testified to her\r\n  observation of a small white car on T.S. Martin approximately thirty minutes\r\n  prior to the shooting incident.Â  According to Precious, the car stopped in the\r\n  middle of the road and she saw one individual exit the vehicle.Â  This person\r\n  started arguing with someone at one of the houses and lifted his shirt to show\r\n  he had a gun tucked in his pants.Â  When he started talking, Precious recognized\r\n  the person as Pooh, whom she had worked with in the past.Â  Precious called him &quot;Pooh,&quot;\r\n  and told him &quot;you need to go somewhere with that mess.&quot;Â  After calling\r\n  out his name, the people from the car left within about two or three minutes.Â \r\n  Although Pooh had a bandana on his face, she recognized him by his voice and\r\n  the way he walked. \r\nThe defense argued to the jury that Pooh\r\n  and Diego had fabricated appellant's involvement in order to make him the &quot;fall\r\n  guy&quot; and cover for one another.Â  Counsel also maintained Tyrone was\r\n  mistaken about his identity of appellant as the person who pointed a gun at him\r\n  in the second incident, just prior to the shooting, and because of this\r\n  mistake, his identification of appellant as the shooter could not be trusted.Â \r\n  The matter was submitted to the jury and appellant was found guilty of the\r\n  murders of Courtney and Terrence.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.&nbsp; Whether\r\n  the trial judge committed reversible error by refusing to conduct an in camera\r\n  hearing pursuant to Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972) and Rule\r\n  104(c), SCRE, on the reliability of Tyrone's identification of appellant as the\r\n  shooter, especially in light of the fact Tyrone had incorrectly identified\r\n  appellant as a participant in an earlier incident shortly before the shooting,\r\n  and his identification of appellant as the triggerman was the product of an\r\n  inherently suggestive show-up conducted by the police after appellant was arrested.\r\n2.&nbsp; Whether\r\n  the trial judge committed reversible error by allowing the State's purported\r\n  gang expert to testify that one of appellant's body markings meant that he had\r\n  committed two prior murders, as this evidence placed appellant's character at\r\n  issue in violation of Rules 403 and 404, SCRE.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the appellate\r\n  court sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial court's\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. This same standard of\r\n  review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility\r\n  of certain evidence in criminal cases.&quot;Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C.\r\n  1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).Â  The admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and\r\n  the court's decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the decision of the trial court is based upon an error\r\n  of law or upon factual findings that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â \r\n  A court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error which\r\n  results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. King, 367 S.C. 131,\r\n  136, 623 S.E.2d 865, 867 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Tyrone's\r\n  Identification\r\nIn a pretrial motion two months before\r\n  the trial, the trial judge indicated he was ready to proceed on the Neil v.\r\n    Biggers hearing.Â  Before calling any witnesses, the State noted the\r\n  constitutional safeguards in place under Neil v. Biggers were designed\r\n  to avert the dangers of mistaken identity and applied in situations involving\r\n  strangers.Â  The State argued, pursuant to State v. McLeod, 260 S.C. 445,\r\n  196 S.E.2d 645 (1973), the trial judge did not need to conduct a basic review\r\n  of the totality of the circumstances and the suggestiveness of the show-up\r\n  where the witness knows, independently from the incident, the person he or she\r\n  is identifying.Â  Accordingly, the State maintained that Neil v. Biggers did not apply in this situation.Â  Defense counsel countered that this case was\r\n  distinguishable from McLeod inasmuch as here, the witness viewed the\r\n  incident from some distance away and, further, there was not a sufficient\r\n  existing relationship between the witness and the person identified.\r\nThe trial judge determined the State\r\n  should put up evidence on Tyrone's prior relationship or knowledge and he would\r\n  then decide whether there needed to be further showing other than the\r\n  relationship between the two.Â  Tyrone testified in an in camera hearing that he\r\n  was in a house on T.S. Martin on August 26, 2004, when he observed the shooting\r\n  from an upstairs window.Â  Tyrone made an in-court identification of appellant\r\n  as the shooter.Â  Tyrone further testified he had known appellant since he was\r\n  elementary school age,[8] had known him for a period of approximately seven years, that appellant used to\r\n  visit Goo's home, an apartment next to where Tyrone's aunt lived, that\r\n  appellant and Goo were friends of his at the time, appellant used to talk to\r\n  Goo for him because Goo was deaf, and the three of them &quot;hung out&quot;\r\n  together for about a four day period.Â  Since elementary school, Tyrone had seen\r\n  appellant twice in 2003 at McDonald's, where appellant worked, and he also saw\r\n  appellant earlier on the day of the shooting, from about two houses away, at a\r\n  housing complex where he observed appellant talking to Delshawn. \r\nDefense counsel argued the State failed\r\n  to make a sufficient showing there was any kind of preexisting relationship\r\n  between Tyrone and appellant and therefore there was no reliable basis for\r\n  Tyrone's identification of appellant.Â  The trial judge found the facts to be\r\n  close to McLeod, but before ruling determined the State should continue\r\n  the examination to show exactly what occurred at the time the identification\r\n  was made so he could look at the totality of the circumstances.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Tyrone testified he observed appellant shooting from &quot;right across the\r\n  street.&quot;Â  He gave Investigator Gray his statement shortly after the\r\n  shooting identifying appellant as the shooter by his nickname.Â  He was taken to\r\n  another location about four blocks away and he sat in Investigator Gray's\r\n  vehicle and observed appellant standing on the side of a police car wearing the\r\n  same clothes he was wearing at the time of the shooting. Â It was dark outside\r\n  at the time he saw appellant, and he remained inside the police car\r\n  approximately three to six feet away from appellant.Â  At the time of the\r\n  shooting, there were no lights on in the upstairs room where he stood, but\r\n  there was a street light on behind the shooter and a light on the side of a\r\n  house.\r\nFollowing Tyrone's in camera testimony,\r\n  defense counsel objected &quot;to the lack of allowing a full Neil v.\r\n    Biggers hearing.&quot;Â  Counsel argued this matter did not fall within McLeod as there was an insufficient showing of &quot;any real meaningful preexisting\r\n  relationship between&quot; Tyrone and appellant.Â  Counsel therefore asked for &quot;a\r\n  full Neil v. Biggers hearing on this issue.&quot;Â  The trial judge noted McLeod indicated constitutional and procedural safeguards under Neil\r\n    v. Biggers were not intended to apply where a victim knows an accused, and McLeod does not talk about the degree of knowledge or indicate there must be an\r\n  intimate relationship.Â  He found, based on the evidence presented, that a\r\n  relationship, or at least knowledge existed, and whether that knowledge was\r\n  sufficient went to the weight of the testimony rather than the admissibility of\r\n  it.Â  The trial judge additionally determined there was sufficient showing by\r\n  the State, under the totality of circumstances, to make an identification, even\r\n  considering the suggestiveness of show-ups, as the witness testified he knew\r\n  the defendant since elementary school, he had seen him at McDonald's, he had\r\n  seen him at the apartment complex on the day of the shooting, he knew him by\r\n  nickname, and he identified him by nickname prior to being taken to the\r\n  location of the identification.Â  The trial judge therefore determined the\r\n  identification testimony was admissible, and the defense could argue about its\r\n  weight to the jury.\r\nAt the\r\n  commencement of the trial two months later, defense counsel asked the trial\r\n  judge to revisit the Neil v. Biggers issue previously raised.Â  Counsel\r\n  noted that some information came out in an unrelated hearing on this case and,\r\n  at the time of the judge's initial ruling on this matter, it had not been known\r\n  that Tyrone had inaccurately identified appellant as the person who had pointed\r\n  a gun at Tyrone in the incident prior to the shooting incident.Â  Counsel\r\n  therefore argued that the judge never had an opportunity to consider this fact\r\n  and appellant was entitled to a full Neil v. Biggers hearing that would\r\n  allow this other information to be considered. Â Counsel further asserted a full\r\n  in camera hearing was required by Rule 104, SCRE. Â The State continued to\r\n  maintain that it had established Tyrone had prior knowledge of the defendant\r\n  and counsel's arguments went to the weight of the evidence and not\r\n  admissibility.Â  The trial judge stated he was still of the opinion a sufficient\r\n  showing had been made by the State to establish a prior knowledge or\r\n  relationship between the witness and the defendant and found, under McLeod,\r\n  that a full Neil v. Biggers hearing was not required.Â  At the close of\r\n  the State's case, counsel renewed the defense objection to the denial of a full Neil v. Biggers hearing.Â  The trial judge overruled the objection.Â  \r\nOn appeal, appellant\r\n  contends the trial judge erred in refusing to conduct an in camera\r\n  hearing regarding the reliability of Tyrone's identification of appellant as\r\n  the shooter.Â  He argues that the shooting occurred in a dark neighborhood with\r\n  various people moving about, and Tyrone testified he observed the shooter from\r\n  an upstairs window.Â  Appellant asserts there were substantial problems with the\r\n  reliability of Tyrone's identification too because, although Tyrone claimed to\r\n  know appellant since elementary school, he was unaware of appellant's real name\r\n  until after he identified appellant to police.Â  Additionally, appellant notes Tyrone\r\n  incorrectly identified appellant as the person who had threatened to kill him a\r\n  short time before the shooting.Â  Appellant contends the fact that a witness\r\n  knew the defendant prior to the commission of the crime is only another factor\r\n  to consider in a Neil v. Biggers analysis when, as here, the witness had\r\n  incorrectly identified the defendant on a previous matter and subsequently\r\n  participates in an inherently suggestive show-up.Â  Appellant further maintains,\r\n  given the importance of Tyrone's testimony identifying him as the shooter, the\r\n  failure to hold a full Neil v. Biggers hearing could not have been\r\n  harmless error.Â  We disagree.[9]\r\nWhen identification of a defendant is at\r\n  issue, the general rule is that a trial court must hold an in camera hearing\r\n  when the State offers a witness whose testimony identifies the defendant as the\r\n  person who committed the crime, and the defendant challenges the in-court\r\n  identification as being tainted by a previous, illegal identification or\r\n  confrontation.Â  State v. Miller, 359 S.C. 589, 596, 598 S.E.2d 297, 301\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004), aff'd, 367 S.C. 329, 626 S.E.2d 328 (2006).Â \r\n  Additionally, our courts have noted Rule 104(c), SCRE,[10] &quot;unambiguously mandates hearings on the admissibility of out of court\r\n  identifications of the accused shall in all cases be held outside the presence\r\n  of the jury,&quot; and while the adoption ofÂ  Rule 104 did not abrogate the\r\n  viability of the rulings in the pre-Rules of Evidence cases, an in camera\r\n  hearing required by Rule 104(c) allows a defendant to question a witness more\r\n  stringently regarding possible misidentification or bias outside the presence\r\n  of the jury.Â  State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 117, 561 S.E.2d 618, 627\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn State v. McLeod, 260 S.C. 445,\r\n  196 S.E.2d 645 (1973), our supreme court addressed the issue of a whether a\r\n  lone confrontation was unfair and untrustworthy where the facts showed the\r\n  victim knew the accused.Â  The facts in McLeod indicate the victim struggled\r\n  with her assailant and exclaimed, &quot;oh, you Hattie's boy,&quot; causing the\r\n  assailant to flee.Â  The victim went to another woman's house after the attack\r\n  and said simply, &quot;Hattie's boy.&quot;Â  The morning after the incident, the\r\n  defendant was arrested and taken to the victim's home.Â  Though the victim did\r\n  not know her assailant's name, she identified the person arrested as the one\r\n  who assaulted her.Â  The victim testified at trial she recognized her assailant\r\n  as &quot;Hattie's boy,&quot; and made an in-court identification of her\r\n  assailant.Â  Id. at 447, 196 S.E.2d at 645.Â  It was &quot;apparent from\r\n  the record [victim] knew the defendant,&quot; &quot;[s]he had seen him many\r\n  times at a neighborhood store near their home; she knew the defendant's mother\r\n  and knew him to be her son.&quot;Â  Id. at 448, 196 S.E.2d at 645.Â  On\r\n  appeal, McLeod challenged the fairness of the pre-trial identification\r\n  procedure used by the police.Â  Id. at 448, 196 S.E.2d at 645-46.Â  The\r\n  court held the rulings in decisions which attempted to avert the danger of\r\n  mistaken identity by establishing mandatory constitutional and procedural\r\n  safeguards were designed for application where the accused and victim are\r\n  strangers to each other, and were &quot;never intended to apply where the\r\n  victim new the accused.&quot;Â  Thus, the constitutional and procedural\r\n  safeguards McLeod claimed were necessary simply did not apply to the facts of\r\n  his case.Â  Id. at 448, 196 S.E.2d at 646.\r\nIn the more recent case of In re\r\n  Robert D., 340 S.C. 12, 530 S.E.2d 137 (Ct. App. 2000), this court held the\r\n  family court did not err in failing to hold an identification hearing pursuant\r\n  to Neil v. Biggers, as the hearing was not necessary because the victim\r\n  knew the defendant.Â  Id. at 17-18, 530 S.E.2d at 140-41.Â  The record\r\n  reflected the victim knew Robert D. by his first name, recognized him as a\r\n  friend of two of her classmates, and remembered he watched a couple of films\r\n  with her class.Â  The court cited McLeod, noting the rules regarding\r\n  out-of-court identifications were &quot;designed for application where the\r\n  accused and the victim are strangers to each other; they were never intended to\r\n  apply where the victim knew the accused.&quot; Â Id. at 18, 530 S.E.2d at\r\n  141. Â Thus, the constitutional and procedural safeguards, which McLeod claimed\r\n  were necessary, simply did not apply under the facts of the case.Â  Id.\r\nWe find McLeod and In re\r\n  Robert D. to be controlling, and that there was sufficient evidence\r\n  presented of Tyrone's prior knowledge of appellant such that a Neil v.\r\n    Biggers hearing was not required. Â Here, the witness knew appellant by his\r\n  nickname, had known him for a number of years, and specifically testified to\r\n  having seen appellant on several occasions over the years, including having\r\n  seen him earlier in the day on the date of the shooting.Â  Additionally, while\r\n  the defense presented evidence Tyrone mistakenly identified appellant as the\r\n  person who pointed a gun at him and threatened him in one of the prior incidents,\r\n  we agree such argument goes to the weight of the evidence.[11] Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Meaning\r\n  of Body Markings\r\nIn the pretrial\r\n  hearing two months prior to appellant's trial, the State indicated its\r\n  intention to present evidence regarding tattoos on appellant's body.Â  Defense\r\n  counsel objected, asserting no specific meaning could be attributed to the\r\n  tattoos, the State was attempting to admit the evidence so the jury would infer\r\n  the tattoos represented the death of the two children, that the tattoo evidence\r\n  was grossly and unduly prejudicial and that it was irrelevant.Â  Counsel further\r\n  argued the State intended to bring out testimony that he received the tattoos\r\n  while in prison, which was improper character propensity evidence.Â  Counsel\r\n  asked the court for an in camera hearing on the matter.Â  When the case resumed\r\n  two months later, counsel sought to exclude the State's gang expert testimony\r\n  on the meaning of two teardrop tattoos on appellant's body, arguing the State\r\n  could not lay a proper foundation to the meaning, and testimony from a\r\n  corrections officer regarding when appellant received the tattoos would allow\r\n  the State to impermissibly remark on appellant's prior criminal record.Â  The\r\n  trial judge determined the evidence was admissible as long as the State laid a\r\n  proper foundation.\r\nPrior to the\r\n  State calling its gang expert witnesses, the defense renewed its objection to\r\n  any testimony regarding the purported meaning of &quot;any tattoos,&quot;\r\n  asserting such testimony would be cumulative and unduly prejudicial, and that the\r\n  State would be unable to provide a foundation for the meaning of the tattoos.Â \r\n  Thereafter, the State presented the testimony of Investigator O'Cain, who was\r\n  qualified as an expert in gang activity and recognition, and Officer Mahoney,\r\n  who was qualified as an expert in the field of gang activity.\r\nO'Cain testified\r\n  to various tattoos and brandings he observed on appellant's body, including\r\n  some indicating appellant's affiliation with the Folk Nation Gang and a &quot;set&quot;\r\n  of the Folk Nation Gang.Â  O'Cain further testified that a branded pitchfork on\r\n  appellant's back appeared to have two hash marks on the right side of the\r\n  pitchfork which could signify appellant's rank.Â  When asked what his expert\r\n  opinion was as to appellant's rank as denoted by the hash marks, O'Cain stated,\r\n  from what he had been told &quot;from the streets and interviews,&quot;\r\n  appellant is now &quot;a set King, strike two,&quot; and &quot;to get the\r\n  strike series of that rank, you have to have bodies attributed to you.&quot;Â \r\n  Counsel objected to this testimony and asked for a mistrial arguing the\r\n  evidence was without support, it was inflammatory, and O'Cain was improperly\r\n  relying on hearsay evidence to support his opinion.Â  The trial court overruled\r\n  the objection, noting reliance on hearsay by the expert was proper under Rule\r\n  703, SCRE.[12] Â O'Cain continued this line of testimony, stating the hash marks represent a\r\n  rank structure and that it could represent bodies attributed to appellant.Â \r\n  When asked what he meant by &quot;bodies,&quot; O'Cain responded, &quot;That\r\n  they have committed some sort of act or murder where bodies - - dead people.&quot;Â \r\n  O'Cain also testified in regard to two teardrops above appellant's right eye,\r\n  one of which was filled in and the other one which was open.Â  O'Cain stated the\r\n  open tear drop could mean a fellow gang member or relative died, or that an\r\n  innocent person was killed by mistake, while the filled in teardrop is supposed\r\n  to represent a retribution, where someone died and that person is responsible\r\n  for that killing.\r\nMahoney likewise\r\n  testified to his observation of various tattoos and brandings on appellant's\r\n  body.Â  In regard to the pitchfork brand on appellant's back, Mahoney testified\r\n  the hash marks could mean a lot of things, including &quot;it could mean\r\n  bodies.&quot;Â  He testified it could also mean robbing someone or other things,\r\n  but &quot;it would be something he did on behalf of the gang,&quot; and could\r\n  include murder.Â  As for the teardrops, Mahoney opined that the open teardrop\r\n  could represent a lost soldier or someone who was innocent, while &quot;the\r\n  closed teardrop is a body.&quot;Â  The open teardrop could be for a fellow gang\r\n  member or an innocent person taken out by mistake, and the closed teardrop\r\n  would represent &quot;a body,&quot; indicating the person is a gang member who &quot;took\r\n  somebody out.&quot;\r\nAfter the State\r\n  rested, appellant renewed his objection &quot;to any gang expert testimony,\r\n  especially any references to the tattoos.&quot;Â  He argued the State introduced\r\n  inadmissible character propensity evidence that was irrelevant to the identity\r\n  of the perpetrator of the crime and was unduly prejudicial.Â  Appellant further\r\n  objected to the expert testimony as it was based on hearsay.Â  The trial judge\r\n  overruled the objection. \r\nThe defense\r\n  presented its own expert in the field of gang identification, Robert Walker,\r\n  who also observed appellant's tattoos and agreed appellant's tattoos reflected\r\n  his affiliation with the Folk Nation Gang. Â As to the hash or &quot;slash&quot;\r\n  marks, Walker testified he had heard they signify rank, but the marks were new\r\n  to him and he really had no knowledge about the meaning.Â  He had not heard it\r\n  meant there were bodies attached to it.Â  In regard to the teardrops, Walker\r\n  explained there were many meanings that could be attributed to them, including\r\n  having killed someone or having served time, but there was no way to say it had\r\n  a specific meaning.Â Â  \r\nOn appeal,\r\n  appellant contends the trial judge erred in allowing Investigator O'Cain to\r\n  testify the hash marks on appellant's back indicated he had bodies attributed\r\n  to him, as this evidence placed his character at issue in violation of Rules\r\n  403 and 404(b), SCRE.[13]Â \r\n  He argues this testimony, in violation of Rule 404(b), &quot;referred to\r\n  possible homicides prior to the two for which [appellant] was standing trial,&quot;\r\n  as the State had maintained the two teardrop tattoos symbolized the homicide of\r\n  Courtney and Terrence.Â  He further summarily argues evidence appellant was\r\n  involved in two prior murders is inadmissible under Rule 403, SCRE, as it is &quot;unduly\r\n  prejudicial and inflammatory.&quot;\r\nRule 403, SCRE\r\n  provides, &quot;Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\r\n  value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion\r\n  of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay,\r\n  waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot;Â  Pursuant\r\n  to Rule 404(b), SCRE provides, &quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\n  is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith.&quot;Â  The rule further provides, &quot;It may, however,\r\n  be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or\r\n  plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe precise\r\n  argument appellant raises on appeal, that the hash mark testimony referred to\r\n  prior homicides and thus violated Rules 403 and 404(b), was not raised to the\r\n  trial judge and therefore is not preserved for review.Â  In his argument to the\r\n  trial court, appellant asserted the State intended to bring out testimony that\r\n  he received the teardrop tattoos while in prison, which was improper\r\n  character propensity evidence.Â  Appellant argued the State's gang expert\r\n  testimony on the meaning of two teardrop tattoos should be excluded, asserting testimony\r\n  from a corrections officer regarding when appellant received the tattoos would\r\n  allow the State to impermissibly remark on appellant's prior criminal record.[14]Â \r\n  On appeal, appellant challenges the admission of the hash mark evidence,\r\n  not that of the teardrops.Â  Appellant never argued to the trial judge as he\r\n  does on appeal that the hash mark brand referred to possible homicides prior to\r\n  the two for which appellant was standing trial, thereby amounting to improper\r\n  character propensity evidence that was unduly prejudicial and inflammatory.Â \r\n  Further, there is nothing in the record to indicate the State asserted the hash\r\n  marks referenced prior bad acts.Â  The State did not present evidence as to when\r\n  appellant obtained the hash marks, nor argue the hash marks were placed on his\r\n  body to signify murders or bad acts committed in incidents unrelated to that\r\n  for which appellant stood trial.Â  Because this argument was neither raised to\r\n  nor ruled upon by the trial judge, it is not properly preserved for our review.Â  See State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 646-47, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174\r\n  (2003) (issue must be raised to and ruled upon by trial court to be preserved\r\n  for review).\r\nFurther, even if\r\n  we assumed appellant's objection to the teardrop tattoo evidence as improper character\r\n  propensity evidence, along with his general objection to any tattoo evidence,\r\n  is sufficient to preserve his assertion on appeal that the hash mark evidence\r\n  improperly placed his character in evidence and was unduly prejudicial, we find\r\n  any error in the admission of this evidence to be harmless. As noted, the\r\n  record shows Pooh testified that appellant stated an intent to go over to T.S.\r\n  Martin just after Pooh's run-in over there. Â Diego testified he agreed to\r\n  accompany appellant to T.S. Martin to &quot;handle something&quot; and\r\n  identified appellant as the one in the group who pointed a rifle at a house\r\n  while all the others ran after the first shot, and later observed appellant\r\n  dispose of the weapon. Â Shante testified she observed appellant running from\r\n  the direction of T.S. Martin at full speed, she overheard appellant saying he\r\n  had just left T.S. Martin, that he was &quot;spraying&quot; when he was\r\n  shooting, that two little kids where shot, and that he had done this because\r\n  earlier in the evening they had gotten into something with some Bloods.Â  Also,\r\n  Tyrone witnessed the shooting and identified appellant as the shooter.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  appellant admitted in his last statement to police that he was present at the\r\n  shooting and he had in fact fired a weapon.Â  Thus, there is substantial other\r\n  evidence suggesting appellant's guilt.Â  Additionally, appellant only points to\r\n  the testimony of O'Cain regarding the hash mark evidence.Â  It is clear Mahoney\r\n  likewise testified the hash marks on appellant &quot;could mean bodies,&quot;\r\n  and the testimony of O'Cain would therefore be largely cumulative to that of\r\n  Mahoney. Â SeeÂ  State v. Page, 378 S.C. 476, 483-84, 663 S.E.2d\r\n  357, 360 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding error is harmless where it could not\r\n  reasonably have affected the trial's outcome; no definite rule of law governs\r\n  the finding that an error was harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial\r\n  character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire\r\n  case; in considering whether error is harmless, a case's particular facts must\r\n  be considered along with various factors including: the importance of the\r\n  witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was\r\n  cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting\r\n  the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of\r\n  cross-examination otherwise permitted, and the overall strength of the\r\n  prosecution's case).Â  Accordingly, any error in the admission of the hash mark\r\n  evidence would be harmless.\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, appellant's convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] &quot;Slobs&quot; was used as a disrespectful term for a gang called the\r\n  Bloods.Â  \r\n[2] Brady testified he later\r\n  determined the person confronting them that day was &quot;Tyrone.&quot; \r\n[3] Sherod is\r\n  apparently Sherod Praylow.\r\n[4] Pooh later identified this female\r\n  as Precious, a person with whom he had worked in the past.\r\n[5] Pooh stated they did not have any\r\n  guns with them, but someone in the car did have some brass knuckles.\r\n[6] In a statement\r\n  to Investigator Gray, Diego informed him that after appellant caught up with\r\n  them, he took off a shirt, wrapped the guns in it, and hid it under a log near\r\n  the railroad tracks.Â  \r\n[7] Appellant's\r\n  gunshot residue test ultimately did not detect sufficient residue to\r\n  conclusively determine whether appellant had fired a weapon that night, and\r\n  thus the test &quot;came back negative.&quot; \r\n[8] Tyrone and appellant did not\r\n  attend the same school.\r\n[9] We note the\r\n  State contends, because defense counsel failed to object when Tyrone's\r\n  identification testimony was presented during the trial and the pre-trial\r\n  rulings on the matter were not made immediately prior to Tyrone's trial\r\n  testimony, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  However, trial counsel did\r\n  not simply object to the admission of the identification evidence in the\r\n  pre-trial motions, but specifically argued the defense was entitled to a\r\n  &quot;full Neil v. Biggers hearing&quot; and objected to the trial\r\n  judge's failure to grant appellant a more extensive hearing on the matter.Â  It\r\n  is from the denial of this extensive hearing that appellant appeals.Â  The\r\n  matter was repeatedly argued and ruled on by the trial court, and we find it\r\n  adequately preserved for our review. \r\n[10] Rule 104(c),\r\n  SCRE provides, in part, that &quot;[h]earings on the admissibility of . . .Â \r\n  pretrial identifications of an accused shall in all cases be conducted out of\r\n  the hearing of the jury.&quot; \r\n[11] We note that Tyrone did not\r\n  identify the appellant as the person who pointed a gun in his face in the\r\n  earlier incident until after the shooting.Â  It is more likely that any\r\n  mistaken identity from the earlier incident was the result of his\r\n  identification of appellant as the shooter in the latter event.Â  \r\n[12] Rule 703, SCRE provides as\r\n  follows:Â  &quot;The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert\r\n  bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the\r\n  expert at or before the hearing.Â  If of a type reasonably relied upon by\r\n  experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the\r\n  subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.&quot;Â  \r\n[13] Appellant argues generally about\r\n  &quot;[o]ne of these witnesses&quot; and &quot;[o]ne of these [tattoos],&quot;\r\n  and cites only to the testimony of Investigator O'Cain and O'Cain's reference\r\n  to the hash marks on appellant's body.Â  \r\n[14] The record\r\n  shows the State sought to introduce evidence that appellant did not have the\r\n  two teardrop tattoos on his face when he initially entered the Department of\r\n  Corrections after the death of the two victims, but was subsequently found to\r\n  have the tattoos during his time there, implying he received the tattoos while\r\n  in the prison system, after the death of the victims.Â  Appellant objected to\r\n  this line of testimony, arguing it would unfairly remark on his prior criminal\r\n  history, and proposed the State introduce the time line of the tattoos without\r\n  referring to the Department of Corrections.Â  As a result, appellant and the\r\n  State thereafter entered into a stipulation that tattoos depicted in certain\r\n  pictures of appellant's body were observed as of February 2, 2006, but were not\r\n  present on appellant's body as of March 11, 2005.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4636","title":"Ervin v.

Samuels, Joseph R.\r\n  Dasta, and Aimee Zmroczek, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tCarmelo Sammataro and Michael Chase, both of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Carol Ervin (Claimant) appeals from\r\n  the trial court's order affirming the decision of the Appellate Panel of the\r\n  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Appellate Panel), arguing\r\n  the court erred in failing to find: (1) her injury was a compensable injury by\r\n  accident within the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act; and (2) her\r\n  injury arose out of her employment.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nClaimant was employed as a unit secretary by Richland Memorial\r\n  Hospital (Employer).Â  Claimant's job duties involved answering the phone,\r\n  greeting hospital visitors and new patients, and entering data.Â  Claimant\r\n  contended she suffered a compensable injury on October 16, 2003, as a result of\r\n  an accident arising out of and in the course and scope of her employment, when\r\n  she was exposed to perfume fragrances.Â  Claimant argued this exposure\r\n  aggravated and exacerbated a preexisting condition to such a degree that she\r\n  became permanently and totally disabled.Â  \r\nClaimant contended she was entitled to: (1) a permanent and total\r\n  disability award; (2) payment of all her past causally-related medical\r\n  expenses; (3) lifetime medical care for her casually-related medical problems;\r\n  and (4) future medical expenses, if permanent and total disability award was\r\n  not granted.Â  \r\nConversely, Employer argued Claimant's alleged injury was not\r\n  compensable because Claimant had experienced asthma problems before October 16,\r\n  2003.Â  Employer asserted a lack of a casual connection between Claimant's\r\n  employment and her current health condition because Claimant's exposure in the\r\n  workplace was no more than what she experienced in her general environment.Â \r\n  Employer contended Claimant's preexisting condition had not changed due to her\r\n  employment, therefore Claimant's prior condition was not exacerbated or\r\n  aggravated on October 16, 2003.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the single commissioner concluded Claimant\r\n  suffered a compensable injury by accident arising out of and in the course and\r\n  scope of her employment because Claimant's preexisting condition was aggravated\r\n  and exacerbated by her job.Â  The single commissioner found Claimant was\r\n  permanently and totally disabled, and ordered Employer to pay for all past\r\n  causally-related medical treatment, as well as causally-related medical\r\n  treatment for the rest of Claimant's life.Â  The single commissioner also\r\n  ordered Employer to pay Claimant a lump sum award for permanent and total\r\n  disability.Â  \r\nEmployer appealed this decision to the Appellate Panel, which\r\n  reversed the single commissioner.Â  The Appellate Panel found Claimant suffered\r\n  an injury as a result of her exposure to perfume.Â  However, the Appellate Panel\r\n  determined the injury was not compensable under South Carolina law because the\r\n  injury was not the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of\r\n  Claimant's employment.Â  Additionally, the Appellate Panel held &quot;the\r\n  causative danger that triggered the Claimant's injury, perfume, was not\r\n  peculiar to the Claimant's place of work.&quot;Â  Claimant appealed to the trial\r\n  court, which affirmed the Appellate Panel.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a Workers' Compensation decision, an appellate court\r\n  may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the Appellate Panel's findings are clearly erroneous in view\r\n  of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Broughton\r\n    v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 495-96, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637-38 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as\r\n  a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the Appellate Panel reached to justify its action.Â  Id.\r\nThe findings of the Appellate Panel are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  Id.Â  As such, this court will affirm findings of facts made\r\n  by the Appellate Panel if those findings are supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.Â  Id.Â  An appellate court will not overturn a\r\n  decision by the Appellate\r\n  Panel unless the\r\n  determination is unsupported by substantial evidence or is affected by an error\r\n  of law.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nClaimant argues the trial court erred in concluding her injury did\r\n  not arise out of and in the course of employment.Â  We disagree. \r\nTo be entitled to compensation for an injury, a claimant must show\r\n  she suffered an injury by accident which arose out of and in the course of the claimant's\r\n  employment.Â  Id. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 638.Â  Thus, to be compensated\r\n  there must be an injury by accident, and such an injury must occur out of and\r\n  in the course of the employment.Â  \r\nThe question of whether the compensability of a particular event\r\n  qualifies as an injury by accident is a question of law.Â  Grayson v. Gulf\r\n    Oil Co., 292 S.C. 528, 532, 357 S.E.2d 479, 481 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  However,\r\n  the question of whether an accident arises out of and in the course and scope\r\n  of employment is largely a question of fact for the Appellate Panel, subject to the substantial evidence\r\n  standard of review.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 496, 520 S.E.2d at 638.Â  As\r\n  such, the claimant bears the burden of proving facts that will bring the\r\n  incident within the purview of compensability.Â  Id.Â  The two parts of\r\n  the phrase &quot;arising out of and in the course of employment&quot; are not synonymous.Â  Id. Rather, both parts must exist simultaneously before recovery is allowed.Â  Id.\r\nEven if we assume Claimant suffered an injury by accident, to be\r\n  compensable, such an injury must arise out of and in the course of Claimant's\r\n  employment. The phrase &quot;arising out\r\n  of&quot; refers to the injury's origin and cause.Â  Id. at 497, 520 S.E.2d at 638.Â  For an injury to\r\n  &quot;arise out of&quot; employment, the injury must be proximately caused by\r\n  the employment.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, before an injury is deemed to arise out\r\n  of employment, a causal connection must exist between the conditions under\r\n  which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.Â  Id.Â \r\n  As the South Carolina Supreme Court has explained: \r\n\r\n\t[The injury] arises &quot;out of&quot; the employment, when there\r\n  is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a\r\n  causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be\r\n  performed and the resulting injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen\r\n  to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been\r\n  contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a\r\n  result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it\r\n  arises &quot;out of&quot; the employment.Â  But it excludes an injury which\r\n  cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and\r\n  which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed\r\n  apart from the employment.Â  The causative danger must be peculiar to the\r\n    work and not common to the neighborhood.Â  It must be incidental to the\r\n  character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and\r\n  servant.Â  It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it\r\n  must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and\r\n  to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\r\n\r\nDouglas v. Spartan Mills,\r\n  Startex Div., 245 S.C. 265, 269, 140\r\n  S.E.2d 173, 175 (1965) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the causative danger, the perfume, was exceedingly common.[1]Â \r\n  Common sense and day-to-day experience dictates many individuals wear perfume\r\n  and cologne.Â  Claimant suffered numerous reactions outside of her employment.Â \r\n  For example, Claimant testified she had or could have had reactions to perfume\r\n  at church, the grocery store, a restaurant, and department stores.Â  Based on\r\n  this, we cannot conclude the Appellate Panel committed reversible error in determining Claimant's accident did not arise out of and in the\r\n  course and scope of her employment.Â  Broughton, 336 S.C. at 495-96, 520 S.E.2d at 637-38\r\n  (finding the question of whether an accident arises out of and in the course\r\n  and scope of employment is largely a question of fact for the Appellate Panel, and as such, an appellate court will\r\n  affirm if that finding is supported by substantial evidence).[2]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Claimant also argues exposure to cleaning agents and\r\n  helicopter fumes resulted in her disability.Â  The trial court ruled only on\r\n  whether Claimant's exposure to perfume resulted in her alleged disability;\r\n  thus, this argument is not preserved.Â  Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497\r\n  S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding for an issue to be\r\n  preserved for appeal it must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge).\r\n[2] Because we conclude Claimant's injury did\r\n  not arise out of her employment, we do\r\n  not address whether Claimant's injury\r\n  was the result of an accident.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n  (1999) (finding this court need not address issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4637","title":"Shirley's Iron Works, Inc. v.

Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-6-210 to -290 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  The SPPA states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) When a governmental body is a party to a contract to improve real property,\r\n    and the contract is for a sum in excess of fifty thousand dollars, the owner of\r\n    the property shall require the contractor to provide a labor and material\r\n            payment bond in the full amount of the contract. \r\n  . . .\r\n  (3) For\r\n          the purposes of any contract covered by the provisions of this section, it is\r\n          the duty of the entity contracting for the improvement to take\r\n            reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate payment bond is issued and\r\n          is in proper form.\r\n  (4) &quot;governmental\r\n          body&quot; means . . . all local political subdivisions.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250 (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).\r\nOn\r\n  or about February 26, 2002, the City issued a request to general contractors\r\n  for proposals for the design and construction of a building (the Project).Â  The\r\n  City chose the proposal of Gilbert Group, LLC (Gilbert).Â  On June 4, 2002, the\r\n  City and Gilbert entered into a general contract[1] (the Contract) to build the Project.Â  Gilbert, in turn, entered into various\r\n  subcontracts, including agreements with Shirley's Iron Works, Inc. and Tindall\r\n  Corporation (collectively the Appellants).Â  However, the City did not require\r\n  Gilbert to furnish a payment bond for the Contract.Â  The Appellants claim they\r\n  performed their work under their subcontracts, but Gilbert has still not paid\r\n  them in full.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  June 11, 2003, the Appellants filed a complaint against the City in which they\r\n  alleged the City failed to obtain a payment bond from Gilbert as required by\r\n  section 29-6-250.Â  In response, the City filed an answer and third-party\r\n  complaint on July 15, 2003.Â  In their answer, the City denied the allegations\r\n  in the complaint and presented a third-party complaint against Gilbert and\r\n  William E. Gilbert[2] for breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act,\r\n  negligence, and fraud.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  an order dated April 19, 2004, Judge Paul E. Short granted the City's motion to\r\n  redesignate Gilbert and William E. Gilbert as defendants because they, along\r\n  with the City, were &quot;joint tortfeasors whose alleged acts combined and\r\n  concurred to cause the harm for which the Plaintiffs seek to recover.&quot;Â  In\r\n  the order, the circuit court held, &quot;the Plaintiffs' cause of action\r\n  against the City sounds in tort,&quot; and was, therefore, &quot;necessarily\r\n  brought pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act . . . .&quot;Â  (SCTCA).Â \r\n  That same day, the circuit court granted the City's motion to strike the\r\n  Appellants' prayer for recovery of attorneys' fees.Â  In that order, Judge Short\r\n  again held the Appellants had alleged a cause of action that sounded in tort.Â \r\n  The Appellants did not appeal either of Judge Short's rulings.\r\nOn\r\n  August 17, 2005, the Appellants filed an amended complaint against the City,\r\n  Gilbert, and William E. Gilbert.Â  In the amended complaint, the Appellants\r\n  alleged Gilbert had failed to pay all the monies owed to them under their\r\n  respective contracts.Â  They also alleged the City failed to secure a payment\r\n  bond from Gilbert, as required by section 29-6-250.Â  The Appellants asserted\r\n  causes of action for violation of section 29-6-250, violation of section 27-1-15\r\n  of the South Carolina Code, negligence, quantum meruit, and attorneys' fees.Â  The\r\n  Appellants also alleged for the first time in the amended complaint they were\r\n  third-party beneficiaries of the Contract because the bonding\r\n  requirements of section 29-6-250 are &quot;legislatively mandated contractual\r\n  obligations&quot; that were incorporated into the Contract by operation of\r\n  law.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 12, 2005, Judge Steven H. John granted the City's motion to strike the\r\n  Appellants' causes of action for attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest as\r\n  set forth in the amended complaint.Â  In his order, Judge John found because\r\n  Judge Short ruled the Appellants' claims sounded in tort, and the Appellants\r\n  had not appealed Judge Short's order, that ruling became the law of the case.Â \r\n  The Appellants did not appeal Judge John's order.\r\nBoth\r\n  parties moved for summary judgment, and the circuit court heard the motions on\r\n  January 23, 2006. Â After the hearing, but before the circuit court ruled on the\r\n  motions, this court issued its opinion in Sloan Construction Co. v. Southco\r\n    Grassing, Inc., 368 S.C. 523, 629 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 2006) on April 24,\r\n  2006.Â  In that case, this court held South Carolina Code sections 29-6-250 and\r\n  57-5-1660(a)(2) do not provide a subcontractor a private right of action\r\n  against a governmental entity for failure to ensure a contractor is properly\r\n  bonded.Â  Id.Â  In light of this court's holding in Sloan Construction,\r\n  the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the City as to the\r\n  Appellants' tort, third-party beneficiary breach of contract,[3] and quantum meruit claims on September 24, 2007.Â  The circuit court did not\r\n  rule on the Appellants' cause of action for attorneys' fees.\r\nOn\r\n  March 24, 2008, however, our supreme court reversed this court's holding in Sloan\r\n    Construction.Â  See Sloan Constr. Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc.,\r\n  377 S.C. 108, 113, 659 S.E.2d 158, 161 (2008).Â  While acknowledging &quot;the\r\n  SPPA does not expressly provide for a right of action between the subcontractor\r\n  and the contracting government body,&quot; the supreme court nevertheless held\r\n  an implied right of action for subcontractors exists under the SPPA because the\r\n  Legislature &quot;must have intended for [suppliers and subcontractors] to be\r\n  able to vindicate their rights under a statute enacted for their special\r\n  benefit.&quot;Â  Id. at 114-16, 659 S.E.2d at 162.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  footnote, the supreme court held although it did not agree with this court's\r\n  analysis of the SPPA, it nevertheless agreed:\r\n\r\n  &quot;[A]\r\n    claim for failure to enforce the bonding requirements of the SPPA is not\r\n      properly brought pursuant to the [(SCTCA)] because the [SCTCA] does not act\r\n    as a waiver of sovereign immunity when a governmental entity fails to enforce a\r\n    statute. [citations omitted].Â  Therefore, the [SCTCA] is not relevant to\r\n    the government's liability for failure to comply with a duty under the\r\n    SPPA.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 118 n.5, 659 S.E.2d at 164 n.5 (citing S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005)) (emphasis added).\r\nThe supreme\r\n  court further held the government's failure to comply with the SPPA's bond\r\n  requirements also gives rise to a third-party beneficiary breach of contract\r\n  claim by the subcontractor against the government entity.Â  Id. at 118,\r\n  659 S.E.2d at 164.Â  In arriving at this conclusion, the Court adopted the\r\n  reasoning of the Seventh Circuit in A.E.I. Music Network v. Bus. Computers,\r\n    Inc., 290 F.3d 952 (7th Cir. 2002).Â  At issue in that case was whether the\r\n  bond requirement of the Illinois Bond Act gave rise to a third-party\r\n  beneficiary breach of contract action against a public entity for failing to\r\n  acquire bonds from contractors on public construction contracts.Â  Id. at\r\n  953-54.Â  The Illinois court held whereas the existence of a direct third-party\r\n  beneficiary to a contract is normally determined by the intentions of the\r\n  actual contracting parties, the relevant intentions in cases falling under the\r\n  Illinois Bond Act were those of the Illinois Legislature alone.Â  Id. at\r\n  955-56.Â  Thus, because the Illinois Legislature intended the bond requirement\r\n  term in the Illinois Bond Act to protect subcontractors, the bond requirement\r\n  became a term in every construction contract involving a public entity.Â  Id. at 955.Â Â  In view of A.E.I. Music, our Supreme Court concluded because\r\n  our Legislature intended the SPPA to bestow a special benefit to\r\n  subcontractors, the bond requirements of the SPPA are, therefore, incorporated\r\n  into all construction contracts governed by the SPPA.Â  Sloan Constr.,\r\n  377 S.C. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  having found section 29-6-250 gives rise to a private right of action against\r\n  the government, the court held the government's liability for failure to comply\r\n  with the SPPA's bonding requirements was not open-ended.Â  Id. at 121,\r\n  659 S.E.2d 165.Â  Rather, the government's liability would be limited to the remaining\r\n  balance on the contract with the general contractor when the subcontractor\r\n  notifies the government of the general contractor's non-payment. Â Id. at\r\n  121, 659 S.E.2d at 165-66.\r\nIn\r\n  light of our supreme court's decision in Sloan Construction, the\r\n  Appellants argue the circuit court erred in granting the City's motion for\r\n  summary judgment as to its claims in tort, breach of contract, quantum meruit,\r\n  and violation of section 27-1-15.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Standard of Review\r\n&quot;An\r\n  appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same\r\n  standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&quot;Â  Bovain\r\n    v. Canal Ins., 383 S.C. 100, 105, 678 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2009).Â  Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP, provides that a trial court may grant a motion for summary judgment &quot;if\r\n  the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP).Â  &quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in\r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South\r\n    Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 329-30, 673 S.E.2d 801, 802 (2009).Â  &quot;At the\r\n  summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not weigh conflicting\r\n  evidence with respect to a disputed material fact.&quot;Â  S.C. Prop. &amp;\r\n    Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  &quot;[I]n cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden\r\n  of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock,\r\n  381 S.C. at 330, 673 S.E.2d at 803.Â  \r\n II.Motions for Summary\r\n  Judgment\r\n\r\n  1.Tort Claim for Violation of\r\n    section 29-6-250\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  City argues summary judgment as to the Appellants' tort cause of action should\r\n  be affirmed because although the supreme court recognized a private right of\r\n  action for failure to enforce the bonding requirements of the SPPA in Sloan\r\n    Construction, if such a claim were brought as a tort, it would be barred by\r\n  the SCTCA.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  SCTCA governs all tort claims against governmental entities and is the\r\n  exclusive remedy available in an action against a governmental entity or its\r\n  employees.Â  Flateau v. Harrison, 355 S.C. 197, 203, 584 S.E.2d 413, 416\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The SCTCA waives sovereign immunity &quot;while also\r\n  providing specific, enumerated exceptions limiting the liability of the state\r\n  and its political subdivisions in certain circumstances.&quot; Wells v. City\r\n    of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 302, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998). Â One\r\n  such exception to the waiver of immunity is found in section 15-78-60(4), which\r\n  states the government is not liable for loss resulting from the government's\r\n  failure to enforce a statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005).\r\nThe\r\n  City argues summary judgment should be affirmed because the Appellants' claims\r\n  sound in tort and are, therefore, barred under the doctrine of sovereign\r\n  immunity.Â  In support of this position, the City cites footnote 5 in Sloan Construction, which\r\n  states: &quot;[A] claim for failure to enforce the bonding requirements of the\r\n  SPPA is not properly brought pursuant to the [SCTCA] because the [SCTCA] does\r\n  not act as a waiver of sovereign immunity when a governmental entity fails to\r\n  enforce a statute.&quot;Â  377 S.C. at 118 n.5, 659 S.E.2d at 164 n.5 (citing\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005)).Â  The City interprets footnote 5 as saying\r\n  if a claim for violation of section 29-6-250 is brought as a tort, it is barred\r\n  by the SCTCA.Â  Thus, because Appellants' claims were brought in tort, their\r\n  claims are barred as a matter of law.\r\nThe\r\n  Appellants, on the other hand, argue section 29-6-250 creates an affirmative\r\n  duty on the government, and the SCTCA does not protect the government from liability\r\n  for breach of that duty.Â  In support of this, they cite to the latter portion\r\n  of footnote 5, which states, &quot;Therefore, the [SCTCA] is not relevant to\r\n  the government's liability for failure to comply with a duty under the\r\n  SPPA.&quot; Â Id.\r\nWe\r\n  believe the Appellants' interpretation is correct.Â  Footnote 5 was merely\r\n  clarifying that while there exists a private right of action under the SPPA, it\r\n  would be improper to assert that right by bringing a claim pursuant to the\r\n  SCTCA for failure to enforce a statute because such claims are clearly barred\r\n  under the SCTCA.Â  Rather, the claim should be brought under the SPPA as a tort\r\n  claim in negligence for breach of the duty created by section 29-6-250.Â  Because\r\n  the Appellants' tort claim alleges negligence arising out of the City's breach\r\n  of its duty to require Gilbert to provide a bond, the Appellants may proceed\r\n  under section 29-6-250. \r\nA\r\n  review of the Sloan Construction opinion supports the conclusion that a\r\n  claim for violation of section 29-6-250 can be brought as a tort.Â  As noted by\r\n  the Supreme Court, the SPPA establishes both an affirmative duty on the\r\n  governmental body to require payment bonding, as well as a standard of care for\r\n  overseeing the issuance of a proper payment bond.Â  Sloan Constr., 377\r\n  S.C. at 115-116, 659 S.E.2d at 162 (citing to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250 and\r\n  providing &quot;it is the duty of the entity contracting for the improvement to\r\n  take reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate payment bond is issued and\r\n  is in proper form&quot;).Â  Such language clearly suggests a tort remedy for\r\n  breach of the duty created pursuant to section 29-6-250 of the SPPA.Â  See Troutman v. Facetglas, Inc., 281 S.C. 598, 601, 316 S.E.2d 424, 426 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1984) (&quot;The elements of a tort are (1) duty; (2) breach of that duty;\r\n  (3) proximate causation; and (4) injury.&quot;).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the supreme court stated in Sloan Construction, &quot;[W]e hold that in\r\n  a tort or contract action arising under the SPPA, the government's\r\n  liability is limited to the unpaid balance on the contract.&quot;Â  377 S.C. at\r\n  121, 659 S.E.2d at 166-67 (emphasis added).Â  The court's holding clearly\r\n  contemplates the possibility of claims being brought under the SPPA in tort or\r\n  contract.Â  In sum, because the Appellants' claim was brought under section\r\n  29-6-250 as a tort, it was properly asserted according to the supreme court's\r\n  holding in Sloan Construction.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to the Appellants'\r\n  tort cause of action.\r\n\r\n  2. Third-Party Beneficiary\r\n    Breach of Contract\r\n\r\nThe Appellants\r\n    argue the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to their third-party\r\n    beneficiary breach of contract claim should be reversed in light of our supreme\r\n    court's decision in Sloan Construction.Â  Although the City concedes Sloan\r\n      Construction establishes that the bonding requirements under the SPPA give\r\n    rise to a private right of action for subcontractors for a third-party\r\n    beneficiary breach of contract claim, the City presents two arguments as to why\r\n    the circuit court's grant of summary judgment should be affirmed.Â  We find both\r\n  arguments to be without merit.\r\nFirst,\r\n  the City argues the Appellants never properly alleged a third-party beneficiary\r\n  breach of contract claim in their amended complaint.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of a pleading is to put the adversary on notice as to what the issues\r\n  are.&quot; Â Langston v. Niles, 265 S.C. 445, 455, 219 S.E.2d 829, 833\r\n  (1975). To ensure substantial justice to the parties, pleadings must be\r\n  liberally construed.Â  Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340\r\n  S.C. 29, 33, 530 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2000).Â In\r\n  determining whether to grant summary judgment, pleadings and documents on file\r\n  must be liberally construed in favor of the non-moving party.Â  Bates v. City\r\n    of Columbia, 301 S.C. 320, 321, 391 S.E.2d 733, 733 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In\r\n  construing a complaint or responsive pleading, the court must review the entire\r\n  pleading. Doe ex rel. Legal Guardian v. Barnwell School Dist. 45, 369 S.C. 659, 663, 633 S.E.2d 518,\r\n  520 (Ct. App. 2006); seeSmith\r\n    v. Nelson, 83 S.C. 294, 300, 65 S.E.\r\n  261, 263 (1909) (construing the &quot;complaint upon the whole&quot;).\r\nThe\r\n  Appellants alleged in the &quot;Facts&quot; section of their amended complaint:\r\n  &quot;[Appellants] are third-party beneficiaries of [the City]'s Agreement with\r\n  Gilbert&quot; because the terms of section 29-6-250 are intended to benefit\r\n  subcontractors and are, therefore, incorporated into the Contract by operation\r\n  of law.Â  Appellants further discussed this theory under the section of the\r\n  amended complaint discussing their cause of action for violation of section\r\n  29-6-250.Â  \r\nLooking\r\n  at the amended complaint in its entirety, we believe the Appellants\r\n  sufficiently pled a third-party beneficiary breach of contract claim.Â  Although\r\n  the complaint did not contain the heading &quot;Third-Party Beneficiary Breach\r\n  of Contract&quot; in the section listing the causes of action, we believe the\r\n  complaint as a whole sufficiently put the City on notice the Appellants wished\r\n  to assert a third-party beneficiary theory.Â  See e.g., Quality Towing 340 S.C. at 33, 530 S.E.2d at 371 (holding trial court erred in limiting the\r\n  complaint to a single portion of an ordinance when, if read in its entirety,\r\n  the complaint gave notice the plaintiff wished to attack the ordinance as a\r\n  whole).Â  This conclusion is supported by the fact that at the hearing on the\r\n  cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties discussed extensively the\r\n  question of whether the proposed private right of action under section 29-6-250\r\n  was a tort or a third-party beneficiary breach of contract.Â  See id.\r\n  (holding trial court erred in limiting operator's complaint to single portion\r\n  of an ordinance when the plaintiff argued the invalidity of the ordinance as a\r\n  whole at the summary judgment hearing).\r\nSecond,\r\n  the City argues the law of the case doctrine precludes the Appellants from\r\n  pursuing an action in contract because the circuit court twice held the\r\n  Appellants' cause of action for violation of section 29-6-250 sounded in tort,\r\n  and this holding was not appealed.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  failure to challenge a ruling constitutes an abandonment of the issue, and the\r\n  unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case.Â  First Union\r\n    Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1998).Â  We do not believe the law of the case doctrine applies here.Â \r\n  Judge Short's and Judge John's statements that the Appellants' claims sounded\r\n  in tort came in the context of a motion to strike; neither judge had before him\r\n  the question of whether the Appellants could pursue their case on a breach of\r\n  contract theory.Â  Thus, as Judge Few noted, they &quot;couldn't have foreclosed\r\n  it if it wasn't before them.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to the Appellants'\r\n  third-party breach of contract claim.\r\n\r\n  3. Necessity of Remand\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  City next contends even assuming arguendo that pursuant to Sloan\r\n    Construction, Appellants' tort and third-party breach of contract claims\r\n  were properly brought under the SPPA, summary judgment as to those claims and\r\n  their quantum meruit claim should nevertheless be affirmed because (1) pursuant\r\n  to Sloan Construction, the City's liability is limited to the remaining\r\n  balance on the contract with the general contractor when the subcontractor\r\n  notifies the government of the general contractor's non-payment, Sloan\r\n    Constr., 377 S.C. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165; and (2) there is no dispute in\r\n  this case that the City paid out the remaining contract price after it was\r\n  notified of the nonpayment.Â  Â We disagree.\r\nFirst,\r\n  the City relies on facts not fully developed at the circuit court.Â  Pursuant to Sloan Construction, the City's liability in this case is limited to (1)\r\n  the remaining unpaid balance on the contract with Gilbert, (2) at the time the\r\n  City received notice from the subcontractor of the general contractor's\r\n  nonpayment.Â  377 S.C. at 121, 659 S.E.2d at 165-66.Â  These are inherently\r\n  factual questions that were disputed at the circuit court, and should not be\r\n  resolved on summary judgment.Â  Moreover, even if we were to assume the City\r\n  did, in fact, pay out the remaining balance on the contract, that fact alone\r\n  would not support summary judgment because the same was true in Sloan\r\n    Construction.Â  In that case, it was undisputed that the government entity\r\n  disbursed the remaining funds to the general contractor when the subcontractor\r\n  notified the government of nonpayment.Â  See id. at 111, 659\r\n  S.E.2d at 160 (&quot;Sloan notified SCDOT in January 2002 that it still had not\r\n  received payment from Southco for the work completed and additionally informed\r\n  SCDOT that Southco had not secured another payment bond following the\r\n  cancellation of the Amwest bond. In March 2003, without having made full\r\n  payment to Sloan, Southco notified SCDOT that it had made all payments on the\r\n  project and SCDOT disbursed final retainage to Southco.&quot;).Â  However, the\r\n  supreme court chose to remand the case to determine the liability even though\r\n  SCDOT had paid out the remaining balance.Â  \r\nThus,\r\n  pursuant to Sloan Construction, we reverse the circuit court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment as to the Appellants' tort, breach of contract, and quantum\r\n  meruit claims, and we remand to the circuit court for findings consistent with\r\n  this opinion.\r\n\r\n  4. Section 27-1-15 of the\r\n    South Carolina Code\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  City argues the Appellants' claim for attorneys' fees under South Carolina Code\r\n  Section 27-1-15[4] is not preserved for review.Â  We agree.\r\nError\r\n  preservation requirements are intended to enable the lower court to rule properly\r\n  after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.Â  I'On v.\r\n    Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).Â  It is\r\n  axiomatic that for an issue to be preserved for appeal, it must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Elam v. S.C. Dept. of Transp.,\r\n  361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-80 (2004).Â  When an issue or argument has\r\n  been raised to but not ruled upon by the trial court, a party must file a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion to preserve the issue for appeal.Â  Id. at 24 n.4,\r\n  602 S.E.2d at 780 n.4.\r\nThe\r\n  Appellants asserted claims pursuant to section 27-1-15 in their amended\r\n  complaint.Â  Thus, the issue of section 27-1-15 was properly raised to the circuit\r\n  court.Â  However, the circuit court's summary judgment order clearly does not\r\n  address the question of the Appellants' entitlement to attorneys' fees and\r\n  interest pursuant to section 27-1-15.Â  Accordingly, it was incumbent upon the\r\n  Appellants to file a Rule 59(e) motion to secure a ruling from the circuit\r\n  court and, consequently, preserve this issue for appeal.Â  The Appellants did\r\n  not file such a motion.Â  We, therefore, need not address this issue because it\r\n  is not preserved for our review.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the decision of circuit court is \r\nREVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART\r\nGEATHERS, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The total value\r\n  of the Contract was approximately $875,000.\r\n[2] William E.\r\n  Gilbert is the sole proprietor of Gilbert Group, LLC.Â  \r\n[3] In granting\r\n  summary judgment, the trial court did not specifically rule as to whether\r\n  Appellants had properly raised a third-party beneficiary breach of contract\r\n  claim in their amended complaint.Â  The trial court held, &quot;[T]o the extent\r\n  the amended complaint may be construed as alleging a third-party beneficiary\r\n  breach of contract claim, the Court finds that such claim must be dismissed . .\r\n  . .&quot;Â  \r\n[4] S.C.

contends\r\n    the family court erred by refusing to:Â  (i) deviate from the child support\r\n    guidelines and include the cost of the parties' daughter's private school\r\n    tuition in calculating child support; (ii) require Jeffrey Smith (Father) to\r\n    obtain life insurance as security for his alimony and child support\r\n    obligations; (iii) consider the cost of Mother's medical insurance in awarding\r\n    alimony; (iv) find the tobacco bonds and Sumter residence titled in Father's\r\n    name were subject to equitable division; and (v) award her attorney's fees and\r\n    costs.Â  In his appeal, Father asserts the family court erred in failing to\r\n    impute income to Mother and in setting the visitation schedule.Â  We affirm in\r\n    part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father\r\n  met and began dating when Father was stationed at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter\r\n  and married in 1990.Â  During the next year, they moved into a house in Sumter,\r\n  and Father, after completing his service obligation to the Air Force, accepted\r\n  employment as a pilot with Delta Airlines.Â  Meanwhile, Mother continued working\r\n  as a schoolteacher in the Sumter County School System.\r\nIn 2001, Mother and\r\n  Father adopted a daughter, Kate, who was fourteen-months-old at the time.Â \r\n  After bringing Kate home in March 2001, they completed an application for Kate\r\n  to attend a local private school, Wilson Hall, once she reached the appropriate\r\n  age.Â  In addition, the parties decided Mother would no longer teach in the\r\n  public school system following the current school year.Â  Instead, they agreed\r\n  Mother would apply for a teaching position at Wilson Hall so she could spend\r\n  more time at home with Kate.Â  Mother was hired as a teacher at Wilson Hall for\r\n  the following year.Â  \r\nDuring this time,\r\n  Father's mother, Janie Carraway (Grandmother), lived in Royal Palm Beach,\r\n  Florida with her husband.Â  After her husband's death, Grandmother sought to\r\n  purchase a home closer to her part-time job and the residence of her oldest\r\n  daughter in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.Â  As she looked to purchase a new home,\r\n  Father solicited the services of Darrell Lowder, an accountant and financial\r\n  planner, for advice on how to protect Grandmother's assets from relatives and\r\n  future nursing home expenses.Â  Lowder advised Father that any new assets\r\n  purchased by Grandmother should be titled in Father's name.Â  Father followed\r\n  Lowder's advice, and when Grandmother purchased a home in Palm Beach Gardens\r\n  (Florida residence), it was titled in Father's name.Â  Although Grandmother paid\r\n  the down payment on the residence and $300 a month towards the mortgage payment,\r\n  the remainder of the $721.40 monthly mortgage payment was paid from the\r\n  parties' joint bank account.Â  For the two years in which Grandmother lived in\r\n  the Florida residence, Mother and Father paid a total of $9,635 in mortgage\r\n  payments and an additional $5,500 for repairs on the Florida residence.Â Â Â  \r\nIn October 2002,\r\n  Grandmother's daughter suffered a stroke.Â  With no family members able to watch\r\n  over her in Florida, Grandmother and Father decided it was in her best\r\n  interests to sell the Florida residence and purchase a home in Sumter.Â  In\r\n  November 2002, the Florida residence was sold for $138,500.[1]Â \r\n  The proceeds from the sale were transferred to the parties' joint bank\r\n  account.Â  The following month, Grandmother purchased a home in Sumter for\r\n  $110,000, titled in Father's name.Â  Mother and Father paid $7,396 from their\r\n  joint account for closing costs and other expenses associated with the Sumter\r\n  residence.Â  After these transactions were complete, Grandmother reimbursed\r\n  Mother and Father for all expenses they had paid on her behalf:Â  the mortgage\r\n  payments on the Florida residence, repairs on the Florida residence, and\r\n  closing costs and other expenses associated with the Sumter residence.Â  Father\r\n  accomplished this by deducting the unreimbursed expenses from the proceeds of\r\n  the sale of the Florida residence, which remained in Mother and Father's joint\r\n  account.Â  Then, Father transferred the remaining proceeds from the sale of the\r\n  Florida residence to a separate savings account for Grandmother.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Father transferred $65,000 from Grandmother's savings account to the joint\r\n  marital account so he could purchase tobacco bonds from Legg Mason for\r\n  Grandmother.Â  Ultimately, Father purchased $40,646 worth of tobacco bonds in\r\n  his name for Grandmother and transferred the remaining $24,354 into\r\n  Grandmother's savings account.Â  \r\nAlthough Mother and\r\n  Father experienced some marital problems throughout the course of their\r\n  marriage, they managed to resolve these issues, and their marriage remained\r\n  intact.Â  However, in September 2003, Father went to Hawaii on vacation without\r\n  Mother and Kate to celebrate his brother-in-law's retirement from the fire\r\n  department.Â  Upon returning home to Sumter, the parties' marital troubles\r\n  escalated, and they began attending counseling sessions.Â  Unable to resolve\r\n  their differences, Father moved in with Grandmother later that month.Â \r\n  Ultimately, Mother discovered Father was having an extramarital affair with a\r\n  flight attendant, Victoria Eckles.Â  In addition, Mother learned Father had\r\n  taken Victoria with him to Hawaii, and on a previous occasion, he had taken\r\n  Kate to see a movie with Victoria.Â  \r\nIn October 2003,\r\n  Mother commenced this divorce action against Father on the grounds of\r\n  adultery.Â  Additionally, Mother sought custody of Kate, child support, alimony,\r\n  equitable division of the marital estate, and attorney's fees.Â  In his answer,\r\n  Father admitted the adultery and agreed Mother should have primary physical\r\n  custody of Kate.Â  In February 2004, the Honorable George M. McFaddin, Jr.\r\n  issued a Pendente Lite Order, granting Mother physical custody of Kate\r\n  and ordering Father pay $1,338 per month in child support, $2,500 per month in\r\n  temporary maintenance, and $12,500 in attorney's fees.Â  Thereafter, a three-day\r\n  trial ensued with the focal point of the litigation dedicated to discerning\r\n  whether the tobacco bonds and Sumter residence, titled in Father's name, were\r\n  marital property subject to equitable division.Â  On January 28, 2005, the\r\n  family court issued a decree of divorce to Mother on the grounds of adultery\r\n  and reserved all other issues.Â  On May 31, 2005, the family court issued a\r\n  supplemental final order, resolving all issues except for attorney's fees.Â  In\r\n  its supplemental order, the court awarded Mother custody of Kate and granted\r\n  Father weekend visitation, including one non-overnight visitation from\r\n  6:00-7:30 p.m. when he did not have weekend visitation the following weekend.Â \r\n  Additionally, the court ordered Father to pay Mother $821 per month in child\r\n  support and $1,650 per month in alimony.Â  The court also found the tobacco\r\n  bonds and Sumter residence were not marital property and not subject to\r\n  equitable division.Â  Both parties filed motions to reconsider, which were denied.Â \r\n  The family court ultimately issued an order denying both parties' requests for\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  Both parties appeal.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from the family court, this court may correct\r\n  errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Semken v. Semken, 379 S.C. 71, 75, 664\r\n  S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We are not, however, required to ignore the\r\n  fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742\r\n  (2008).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  MOTHER'S APPEAL\r\nA. Private School Tuition\r\nMother\r\n  contends the family court erred in refusing to deviate from the child support\r\n  guidelines and include the cost of Kate's private school tuition in calculating\r\n  child support.Â  In its order, the family court refused to deviate from the\r\n  child support guidelines, finding such relief was not requested in Mother's\r\n  pleadings or at trial.Â  On appeal, Mother argues the family court erred in\r\n  failing to liberally construe her pleadings.Â  She asserts her request for\r\n  &quot;such other relief as the court may deem fit and proper&quot; in her\r\n  complaint and her testimony about the cost of Kate's private school tuition was\r\n  sufficient to place the issue before the family court.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nRule 12 of the\r\n  Rules of Practice for the Family Courts of South Carolina governed the\r\n  construction of pleadings in family court until it was repealed with the\r\n  enactment of the South Carolina Rules of Family Court on September 1, 1988.Â  See Ward v. Marturano, 302 S.C. 112, 115, 394 S.E.2d 16, 18 (Ct. App. 1990)\r\n  (stating former Rule 12 required pleadings to be liberally construed); Rule\r\n  2(d), SCRFC (&quot;All Rules of Practice for the Courts of this State\r\n  heretofore adopted are repealed as of the effective date of the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Family Court.&quot;).Â  Currently, no family court rule governs the\r\n  construction of pleadings.Â  As a result, Rule 8(f), SCRCP applies.Â  See Rule 81, SCRCP (stating The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply in\r\n  family court when no family court rule provides otherwise).Â  Rule 8(f) requires\r\n  courts to construe pleadings so &quot;as to do substantial justice to all\r\n  parties.&quot;Â  &quot;To ensure substantial justice to the parties, the\r\n  pleadings must be liberally construed.&quot;Â  Gaskins v. S. Farm Bureau Cas.\r\n    Ins. Co., 343 S.C. 666, 671, 541 S.E.2d 269, 271 (Ct. App. 2000), aff'd\r\n      as modified on other grounds, 354 S.C. 416, 581 S.E.2d 169 (2003).Â Â Â  \r\nIn McMaster v.\r\n  Strickland, although the plaintiff captioned his action as one for\r\n  &quot;Breach of Contract,&quot; he failed to request monetary damages in his\r\n  complaint.Â  Instead, the plaintiff asked only for specific performance and\r\n  &quot;such other or further relief as the Court deems just and proper.&quot;Â \r\n  322 S.C. 451, 454, 472 S.E.2d 623, 625 (1996).Â  Nonetheless, the special referee\r\n  awarded plaintiff monetary damages.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, the defendant\r\n  argued the special referee erred in awarding plaintiff relief not requested in\r\n  his pleadings.Â  Id.Â  Our supreme court upheld the special referee's\r\n  award of monetary damages because the factual allegations of the complaint\r\n  supported such an award and because the complaint contained a prayer for\r\n  general relief.Â  Id.Â  In reaching its conclusion, the supreme court\r\n  relied heavily on Mortgage Loan Co. v. Townsend,Â  156 S.C. 203, 152 S.E.\r\n  878 (1930).Â  In Townsend, the supreme court held &quot;[i]f the facts alleged are broad enough to warrant relief,\r\n  it matters not how narrow the specific prayer may be if the bill contains a\r\n    prayer for general relief.&quot;Â  Id. at 225, 152 S.E. at 886 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nIn Ward\r\n  v. Marturano, father commenced an action seeking a reduction in child\r\n  support after learning daughter was entitled to social security benefits.Â  302\r\n  S.C. 112, 113, 394 S.E.2d 16, 17 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In addition to granting\r\n  father this relief, the family court also determined father was entitled to a\r\n  credit for previous social security benefits received by daughter.Â  Id. at 114, 394 S.E.2d at 17.Â  On appeal, mother contended the family court erred\r\n  in crediting father with all past social security payments received by daughter\r\n  because father did not specifically request such relief in his pleadings.Â  Id. at 115, 394 S.E.2d at 18.Â  While this court found father did not specifically\r\n  request credit for past payments, it affirmed the family court's decision\r\n  because father's complaint contained a prayer for general relief and because\r\n  the treatment of past paid benefits was at issue.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGenerally, the\r\n  amount of child support which would result from the application of the child\r\n  support guidelines is the amount of child support to be awarded.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. Â§ 114-4710(A)(1) (Supp. 2008).Â  However, the Guidelines do not take\r\n  into account the economic impact of private school tuition and specifically\r\n  list the expenses incurred on private school tuition as a possible reason for\r\n  deviation from the Guidelines.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 114-4710(B)(1) (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  While the family court maintains the discretion to decide whether to\r\n  deviate from the child support guidelines in a given case, its decision must\r\n  rest upon sound legal principles.Â  See Smith v. Doe, 366 S.C.\r\n  469, 474, 623 S.E.2d 370, 372 (2005) (&quot;Child support awards are within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.&quot;); McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543,\r\n  324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984) (stating an abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  family court's findings are without evidentiary support or a ruling is based\r\n  upon an error of law.).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the family court erred in refusing to consider whether deviation from\r\n  the child support guidelines was appropriate in this case.Â  Contrary to the\r\n  decision of the family court, Mother's pleadings and the evidence presented at\r\n  trial sufficiently placed this issue before the court.Â  Similar to McMaster, Townsend, and Ward, Mother did not specifically ask the family\r\n  court to deviate from the child support guidelines in her complaint.Â  Rather,\r\n  in her complaint, Mother asserted she was entitled to receive child support as\r\n  set forth by the guidelines and, in addition, prayed for &quot;such other\r\n  relief as the Court may deem appropriate.&quot;Â  By claiming entitlement to\r\n  child support based upon the guidelines and including a prayer for general\r\n  relief, Mother's pleadings were sufficient for the family court to decide\r\n  whether deviation from the child support guidelines was appropriate, if such\r\n  evidence was introduced at trial.Â  See Townsend, 156 S.C. at 225,\r\n  152 S.E. at 886 (&quot;If the facts alleged are broad\r\n  enough to warrant relief, it matters not how narrow the specific prayer may be if\r\n  the bill contains a prayer for general relief.&quot;).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Mother testified at length about the fact Kate attended private school,\r\n  the cost of her tuition, and her desire for Kate to continue attending school\r\n  there.Â  Additionally, Mother testified she and Father mutually decided to\r\n  enroll Kate in private school.Â  On cross examination of Father, Mother's\r\n  attorney specifically asked Father, &quot;[w]hat is your position in regards to\r\n  the payment of the Wilson Hall tuition?&quot;Â  Simply put, a central issue at\r\n  trial was whether Father would have to contribute towards Kate's private school\r\n  tuition.Â  See Ward,Â  302 S.C. at 115, 394 S.E.2d at 18 (determining the family\r\n  court did not err in awarding relief not specifically requested in father's\r\n  pleadings where his complaint contained a prayer for general relief, and the\r\n  relief granted addressed a central issue at trial).Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court erred in refusing to consider this issue.Â  As a result, we remand\r\n  this issue to the family court to consider whether deviation from the\r\n  Guidelines is appropriate in this case.Â  Â \r\nB. Life Insurance As\r\n  Security For Alimony &amp; Child Support\r\nMother argues the\r\n  family court erred by not requiring Father to obtain life insurance as security\r\n  for Father's alimony and child support obligations.Â  Mother contends she\r\n  demonstrated the need for such security in light of her age, health concerns,\r\n  limited earning capacity, limited assets, and Father's dangerous occupation as\r\n  a pilot.Â  In addition, Mother asserts Father has the financial ability to\r\n  acquire life insurance as evidenced by his earning capacity.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  may order the payor spouse to obtain life insurance as security for an alimony\r\n  or child support obligation if the supported spouse can demonstrate the\r\n  existence of special circumstances with reference to her need for the security\r\n  and the payor spouse's ability to provide it.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364\r\n  S.C. 532, 553, 615 S.E.2d 98, 109 (2005); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(D) (Supp. 2008).Â  In considering whether the supported spouse has\r\n  demonstrated a need for such security, the family court should consider\r\n  &quot;the supported spouse's age, health, income earning ability, and\r\n  accumulated assets.&quot;Â  Wooten, 364 S.C. at 553, 615 S.E.2d at 109.Â \r\n  If a need for security is found, the family court should then consider the\r\n  payor spouse's ability to secure the award with life insurance by considering\r\n  &quot;the payor spouse's age, health, income earning ability, accumulated\r\n  assets, insurability, cost of premiums, and insurance plans carried by the\r\n  parties during the marriage.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nMother has not\r\n  demonstrated the existence of special circumstances giving rise to a need for\r\n  security in this case.Â  The record reveals Mother was forty-three-years-old at\r\n  the time of trial.Â  Although she had two benign breast biopsies in the past,\r\n  Mother testified repeatedly at trial that she was in good health.Â \r\n  Additionally, while Mother currently earns less than $30,000 annually for\r\n  teaching at private school, her &quot;income earning ability&quot; is\r\n  substantially higher.Â  If Mother chose, she could earn close to $50,000\r\n  annually as a public schoolteacher.[2]Â \r\n  Finally, Mother owns substantial assets as a result of the equitable division\r\n  of the marital estate.Â  In its final order, the family court awarded Mother\r\n  fifty percent of the marital assets, including the marital home, which the\r\n  family court valued at $364,000.Â  While Father is in good health and can afford\r\n  the insurance premiums, Mother failed to demonstrate the existence of special\r\n  circumstances giving rise to a need for security.Â  Thus, the family court did\r\n  not err in refusing to require Father to obtain life insurance as security for\r\n  his child support and alimony obligations.\r\nC. Mother's\r\n  Medical Insurance &amp; Expenses\r\nMother argues the\r\n  family court erred by not requiring Father to continue to provide health\r\n  insurance to her through his employer.Â  Alternatively, she contends the family\r\n  court was required to consider the cost associated with obtaining health\r\n  insurance on her own in awarding alimony.Â  In its order, the family court\r\n  refused to address these issues, finding &quot;Mother did not seek medical or\r\n  health insurance coverage from Father in her pleadings or during her testimony,\r\n  nor did Mother seek payment of her medical or health insurance expenses from\r\n  Father.&quot;Â  We disagree with the findings of the family court.Â  \r\n&quot;Alimony is a\r\n  substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital\r\n  relationship.&quot;Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d\r\n  107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œGenerally, alimony should place the supported\r\n  spouse, as nearly as practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the\r\n  marriage.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  The decision to grant or deny alimony rests within the sound\r\n  discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 357 S.C. 354, 360, 592 S.E.2d\r\n  637, 640 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Section 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2008) sets forth twelve factors which must be weighed when determining\r\n  alimony.Â  In deciding whether to award alimony, the\r\n  family court must consider:\r\n\r\n  (1) the duration of the marriage and the ages of the parties at\r\n    the time of the marriage and at separation; (2) the physical and emotional\r\n    condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse and the\r\n    need for additional education; (4) the employment history and earning potential\r\n    of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6)\r\n    the current and reasonably anticipated income of each spouse; (7) the current\r\n    and reasonably anticipated expenses of each spouse; (8) the marital and\r\n    nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) the custody of any children; (10)\r\n    marital misconduct or fault; (11) the tax consequences of the award; (12) the\r\n    existence of support obligations to a former spouse; and (13) such other\r\n    factors the court considers relevant.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nId.Â  The family court may weigh these factors as it deems\r\n  appropriate.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs an initial\r\n  matter, the family court is mistaken in concluding Mother did not ask for\r\n  medical or health insurance coverage from Father in her pleadings or at trial.Â \r\n  In her pleadings, Mother asked for &quot;coverage for Plaintiff and the minor\r\n  child on Defendant's health and dental insurance.&quot;Â  At trial, Mother, who\r\n  had been covered under Father's health insurance plan during the parties'\r\n  marriage, testified she wanted to continue with &quot;the same type of coverage\r\n  [she] had in the past.&quot;Â  Although the family court erred in refusing to\r\n  address the merits of this issue, there is nothing in the record to indicate\r\n  that Father's insurance carrier would allow him to carry Mother on his health\r\n  insurance plan after the parties' divorce became final.Â  See Germain\r\n    v. Nichol, 278 S.C. 508, 509, 299 S.E.2d 335, 335 (1983) (holding that the\r\n  appealing party has the burden of providing a sufficient record).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we cannot grant Mother any relief from this error.Â  Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court also erred by refusing to consider the cost associated with Mother\r\n  obtaining health insurance on her own in awarding alimony.Â  In her pleadings,\r\n  Mother alleged she was entitled to alimony.Â  Section 20-3-130(C) requires the\r\n  family court to consider all of the twelve factors enumerated in that section\r\n  when determining alimony.Â  Id.; see Epperly v. Epperly,\r\n  312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1994) (noting the statute &quot;sets\r\n  forth twelve factors which must be weighed when determining\r\n  alimony.&quot;) (emphasis in original).Â  Factor number seven requires the court\r\n  to consider &quot;the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of\r\n  both spouses.&quot;Â  Â§ 20-3-130(C).Â  Thus, regardless of whether Mother asked\r\n  the family court to consider the cost of obtaining health insurance in her\r\n  pleadings, the family court was required to consider this expense in awarding\r\n  alimony.Â  At trial, Mother testified that health insurance through her employer\r\n  would cost $189 a month.Â  However, the family court refused to consider this\r\n  expense because &quot;[Mother] did not ask that such expenses be considered in\r\n  the alimony calculation.&quot;Â  This was error.Â  As a result, we remand this\r\n  issue to the family court to consider adjusting Mother's alimony award in light\r\n  of this expense.Â  Â \r\nD.Â Equitable\r\n  Division \r\nMother argues the\r\n  tobacco bonds and Sumter residence were marital property subject to equitable\r\n  division because they were purchased with marital funds.Â  Alternatively, Mother\r\n  asserts the tobacco bonds and Sumter residence, both titled in Father's name,\r\n  were transmuted into marital property and subject to equitable division.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nMarital property is\r\n  defined as all real and personal property acquired by the parties during\r\n  marriage and owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital\r\n  litigation regardless of how title is held.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2008). Â Section 20-3-630(A)(1)-(4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2008) contains four exceptions to this general rule.Â  Thus, even if property\r\n  fits within the statutory definition of marital property, the property is\r\n  considered nonmarital if either party acquires the property by inheritance,\r\n  devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than the spouse.Â  Â§\r\n  20-3-630(A)(1).Â  In addition, property acquired by either party in exchange for\r\n  property acquired by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift is nonmarital.Â  Â§ 20-3-630(A)(3); see Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 538\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;[P]roperty acquired during the marriage in exchange for\r\n  nonmarital property is nonmarital.&quot;).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nProperty\r\n  that is nonmarital at the time of its acquisition retains its separate identity\r\n  unless it becomes transmuted into marital property.Â  Miller v. Miller,\r\n  293 S.C. 69, 71, 358 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987).Â  Nonmarital\r\n  property may be transmuted into marital property if: Â (1) it becomes so\r\n  commingled with marital property to render it untraceable; (2) it is titled\r\n  jointly; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in\r\n  some manner evidencing an intent by the parties to make it marital property.Â  Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  &quot;Transmutation is a matter of intent\r\n  to be gleaned from the facts of each case.&quot;Â  Jenkins, 345 S.C. at\r\n  98, 545 S.E.2d at 537.Â  &quot;The spouse claiming transmutation must produce\r\n  objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves\r\n  regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.&quot;Â  Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11. \r\nAt trial,\r\n  Grandmother testified that she gave Father the funds to purchase the tobacco\r\n  bonds and Sumter residence from her personal savings account.[3]Â  See Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1) (stating property is considered nonmarital if\r\n  either party acquires the property as a gift from a party other than the spouse).Â \r\n  Father and Darrell Lowder, Father's accountant and financial planner,\r\n  corroborated Grandmother's testimony.Â  In addition, Father produced financial\r\n  records, showing the money used to acquire these assets came from Grandmother's\r\n  savings account.Â  Because the parties were married when Father acquired title\r\n  to the tobacco bonds and Sumter residence, the character of the funds used to\r\n  purchase these assets determines whether the assets themselves should be\r\n  considered marital or nonmarital property.Â  See Â§ 20-3-630(A)(3)\r\n  (stating property acquired by either party in exchange for property acquired by\r\n  a gift is nonmarital); Jenkins, 357 S.C. at 100, 592 S.E.2d at 538\r\n  (&quot;[P]roperty acquired during the marriage in exchange for nonmarital\r\n  property is nonmarital.&quot;).Â  Thus, if the money found in Grandmother's\r\n  savings account qualified as nonmarital property, the tobacco bonds and Sumter\r\n  residence should also be characterized as nonmarital property.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFather opened\r\n  Grandmother's savings account after the sale of the Florida residence.Â  While\r\n  Grandmother lived in the Florida residence, Mother and Father paid $9,635 in\r\n  mortgage payments and $5,500 for repairs on the house from their joint\r\n  account.Â  However, once the Florida residence was sold, the proceeds from the\r\n  sale, $73,982.33, were transferred into Mother and Father's joint account.Â \r\n  From these proceeds, Grandmother reimbursed Mother and Father for the mortgage\r\n  payments and repairs.Â  Additionally, Grandmother reimbursed Mother and Father\r\n  for closing costs and other expenses they provided for the Sumter residence.[4]Â \r\n  This was accomplished by Father deducting these unreimbursed expenses from the\r\n  proceeds of the sale of the Florida residence, which remained in Mother and\r\n  Father's joint account.Â  Then, Father transferred the remaining proceeds from\r\n  the sale of the Florida residence to Grandmother's newly opened savings\r\n  account.Â  Thus, all marital funds spent on the Florida residence were fully\r\n  reimbursed to Mother and Father with the sale of the Florida residence.Â \r\n  Additionally, all remaining proceeds from the sale of the Florida residence\r\n  were used to create Grandmother's savings account.Â  Because all marital funds\r\n  spent on the Florida residence were reimbursed, Grandmother's savings account\r\n  qualified as nonmarital property.Â  From Grandmother's savings account, the\r\n  tobacco bonds and Sumter residence were purchased.Â  As a result, these assets\r\n  were also nonmarital property and not subject to equitable division, unless they\r\n  became transmuted into marital property.Â  See Â§ 20-3-630(A)(3) (stating\r\n  property acquired by either party in exchange for property acquired by a gift\r\n  is nonmarital); Miller, 293 S.C. at 71, 358 S.E.2d at 711\r\n  (&quot;Property that is nonmarital at the time of its acquisition retains its\r\n  separate identity unless it is transmuted into marital property.&quot;).Â  \r\nBecause Mother\r\n  claims the tobacco bonds and Sumter residence were transmuted into marital\r\n  property, she bears the burden of &quot;produc[ing] objective evidence showing\r\n  that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the\r\n  common property of the marriage.&quot;Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295, 372\r\n  S.E.2d at 111.Â  She has not carried this burden.Â  At trial, no testimony was\r\n  introduced evidencing an intent for these assets to become marital property.Â \r\n  Instead, Father, Grandmother, and Darrell Lowder all testified the tobacco\r\n  bonds and Sumter residence were titled in Father's name for the purpose of\r\n  protecting these assets from Grandmother's relatives and future nursing home\r\n  expenses.Â  While Mother and Father claimed they owned the tobacco bonds and\r\n  Sumter residence on their tax returns, they only did so in accordance with the\r\n  advice of Lowder.[5]Â \r\n  Because the record does not reveal that the parties regarded the tobacco bonds\r\n  or Sumter residence as marital property during their marriage, the family court\r\n  did not err in concluding these assets retained their character as nonmarital\r\n  property.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's ruling.\r\nE.Â Attorney's Fees\r\n  &amp; Costs\r\nMother argues the\r\n  family court erred by failing to award her attorney's fees and costs.Â  We\r\n  remand this issue to the family court for further consideration. \r\n&quot;The award of attorney's fees is left to\r\n  the discretion of the trial judge and will only be disturbed upon a showing of\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624\r\n  S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006).Â  In awarding attorney's fees, the court should consider\r\n  each party's ability to pay his or her own fee, the beneficial results obtained\r\n  by the attorney, the parties' respective financial conditions, and the effect\r\n  of the fee on each party's standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307\r\n  S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the amount of\r\n  attorney's fees to award, the court should also consider the:Â  (1) nature,\r\n  extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) time necessarily devoted to the case;\r\n  (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5)\r\n  beneficial results obtained; (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock\r\n    v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nWe have already concluded\r\n  that the family court erred in refusing to address the cost of Kate's private\r\n  school tuition and the cost of Mother's medical expenses.Â  On remand, it is\r\n  possible the family court may decide these issues in Mother's favor.Â  If they\r\n  are decided in Mother's favor, this result could alter the court's analysis of\r\n  the &quot;beneficial results obtained at trial.&quot;Â  Accordingly, any\r\n  determination of whether to award attorney's fees must wait until these issues\r\n  are revisited by the family court.Â  Thus, this issue is remanded to the family\r\n  court.\r\nII.Â  FATHER'S APPEAL\r\nA. Voluntary Underemployment\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to impute income to Mother because she\r\n  could earn a higher salary teaching in public schools.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The failure\r\n  to reach earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically equate to\r\n  voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.&quot;Â  Gartside\r\n    v. Gartside, 383 S.C. 35, 44, 677 S.E.2d 621, 626 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  common thread in cases where actual income versus earning capacity is at issue\r\n  is that courts are to closely examine the payor's good-faith and reasonable\r\n  explanation for the decreased income.&quot;Â Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 489, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  However, a parent seeking to impute\r\n  income to the other parent need not establish a bad faith motivation to prove\r\n  underemployment.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13, 636 S.E.2d 864, 866\r\n  (2006).Â Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  did not err in refusing to impute income to Mother.Â  For most of the parties'\r\n  marriage, Mother taught in public schools.Â  In fact, Mother did not quit\r\n  working in public schools until the parties adopted Kate in 2001.Â  After\r\n  adopting Kate, Mother and Father mutually agreed she would no longer teach in\r\n  the public school system so she could spend more time at home with Kate.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Mother began working at Wilson Hall.Â  Because Mother's decision to\r\n  quit working at public school was the product of a mutual decision made during\r\n  the parties' marriage, the family court did not err in refusing to impute\r\n  income to Mother.Â  \r\nB. Visitation\r\nFather asserts the\r\n  family court erred in the manner in which it awarded visitation.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Father claims the family court erred by not awarding him more flexible weekend\r\n  visitation and overnight visitation on weekdays.Â  Additionally, he argues the\r\n  family court erred in:Â  allowing Mother to deny visitation for &quot;good cause&quot;;\r\n  requiring the parties to exchange Kate on Christmas Day; limiting telephone\r\n  contact with the child to three days a week for no more than twenty minutes at\r\n  a time; not stating whether Kate was barred from international travel; not\r\n  requiring Kate to obtain a passport to facilitate international travel; and not\r\n  allowing Kate to fly unaccompanied when she reaches the age permitted by the\r\n  airlines.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe welfare and\r\n  best interests of the child are the primary considerations in determining\r\n  visitation.Â  Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 191, 531 S.E.2d 297,\r\n  300 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The family court has the discretion to place limitations\r\n  on visitation.Â  Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. 530, 536, 381 S.E.2d 913, 916\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, the family\r\n  court's order limiting visitation rights will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court did\r\n  not err in setting the visitation schedule.Â  As an initial matter, the family\r\n  court provided Father with a flexible visitation schedule.Â  Father's work\r\n  schedule varies from month-to-month, and he does not receive notice of his\r\n  schedule for the upcoming month until the end of the current month.Â  Because of\r\n  this, the family court allowed Father to advise Mother of his schedule when he\r\n  received it.Â  After consulting his work schedule, Father could request\r\n  visitation with Kate during the upcoming month.Â  Obviously, this flexible\r\n  visitation schedule requires the parties to work together to facilitate\r\n  Father's visitation.Â  Recognizing this, the family court admonished Mother that\r\n  she should not &quot;without good and just cause, deny Father's\r\n  requests.&quot;Â  Therefore, contrary to Father's assertion in his brief, the\r\n  family court did not leave Father's regular visitation to the whim of Mother.Â \r\n  Rather, the family court, in making this statement, was urging the parties to\r\n  work together so as to accommodate Father's unpredictable schedule.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Father has failed to point to any evidence in the record indicating that Mother\r\n  has arbitrarily or &quot;without good and just cause&quot; denied Father's\r\n  visitation requests.Â  As for Father's remaining arguments, there is no evidence\r\n  demonstrating that the family court abused its discretion in resolving these\r\n  issues.[6]Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the family court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., and\r\n  LOCKEMY, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Florida residence was purchased by Grandmother in\r\n  October 2000 for $102,000.Â  \r\n[2] According to Wooten, courts must consider\r\n  &quot;the earning ability&quot; of the supported spouse in assessing her need\r\n  for life insurance as security for alimony and child support.Â  364 S.C. at 553,\r\n  615 S.E.2d at 109.Â  This is a separate inquiry from determining whether Mother\r\n  is voluntarily underemployed and in no way shapes our analysis on that issue.Â  \r\n[3] While Grandmother failed to file a gift tax return\r\n  evidencing her gift of these funds to Father, her failure to do so is not\r\n  dispositive on the issue of whether a gift was actually given.\r\n[4] Mother and Father paid $7,396 from their joint\r\n  account for closing costs and other expenses associated with the recent\r\n  purchase of the Sumter residence.Â  \r\n[5] At trial, Lowder testified the parties did not\r\n  receive a tax advantage or detriment as a result of listing these assets on their\r\n  return.Â  \r\n[6] The family court did not rule on the following issues\r\n  at trial:Â  whether Kate was barred from\r\n  international travel and whether Kate must obtain a passport to facilitate\r\n  international travel.Â  While these issues were raised at trial, the family\r\n  court did not rule on them, and Father did not ask the family court to consider\r\n  these issues in his Rule 59 motion.Â  Accordingly, these issues are not\r\n  preserved for appeal.Â  See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361\r\n  S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (stating a party must file a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion when an issue or argument has been raised, but not ruled on, in order to\r\n  preserve it for appellate review).Â  Additionally, Father never put forth any\r\n  evidence at trial as to the age at which airlines allow children to fly\r\n  unaccompanied.Â  This issue is likewise unpreserved for appeal.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4639","title":"In the Interest of Walter M.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4639","description":"In this criminal case from Georgetown County, the juvenile appellant appeals a murder conviction for the shooting death of his ten (10) year old friend.

Dudek, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and\r\n  Assistant Attorney General J. Anthony Mabry, of Columbia; and Solicitor John G.\r\n  Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J.: Walter M. (Appellant) appeals his\r\n  conviction for the murder of Zachary H. (Victim).Â  Appellant alleges that the\r\n  family court erred in (1) denying a directed verdict on the charge of murder\r\n  because the State presented no evidence of malice aforethought and (2) finding Appellant\r\n  guilty of murder because the State presented no evidence proving malice\r\n  aforethought.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  the afternoon of July 7, 2006, Appellant, Victim, and another friend,[1] were playing video games at Appellant's home.Â  Victim went to the freezer to\r\n  get a popsicle without Appellant's permission. Â When Victim refused to return\r\n  the popsicle to the freezer, Appellant chased him around the living room eventually\r\n  retrieving the popsicle.Â  As Appellant put the popsicle back in the freezer,\r\n  Victim ran outside. Â Appellant locked the front door after Victim ran\r\n  out. \r\nVictim\r\n  banged on the door and rang the doorbell in an effort to get back inside. Â Meanwhile,\r\n  Appellant retrieved his brother's loaded .22 caliber rifle from a bedroom\r\n  closet, walked to another room, opened the window, and pointed the gun at\r\n  Victim, ordering him to stop banging on the door.Â  Victim replied &quot;are you\r\n  really going to shoot me?&quot;Â  Appellant responded &quot;[n]o&quot; and the\r\n  boys apparently began laughing.Â  Moments later, Appellant fired two shots: one\r\n  into the ground near Victim, and a second, fatal shot, into Victim's chest. Â Appellant\r\n  maintains the rifle accidentally discharged as he attempted to pull it back in\r\n  the window.Â  A South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) forensic firearms\r\n  expert testified it required six pounds of pressure on the trigger to discharge\r\n  the first shot, and the same six pounds to discharge the second. Â This expert\r\n  also testified that the recoil on the particular firearm was negligible.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  firing the two shots, Appellant called 911, then ran next door and told the\r\n  neighbor he had accidentally shot Victim.Â  Although a bystander was able to\r\n  administer CPR, Victim died within minutes of being shot.Â  \r\nOfficer\r\n  Eric Dean was the first law enforcement officer to arrive on the scene and\r\n  noticed Appellant holding Victim's hand as an unknown good Samaritan attempted\r\n  CPR.Â  Dean testified that Appellant stated, &quot;I asked [Victim] to leave me\r\n  alone and he wouldn't so I shot to scare him.&quot; Â Appellant denied\r\n  making this statement.Â  Dean further testified Appellant never said anything\r\n  about the shooting being an accident and denied Appellant's claim that he\r\n  intimidated Appellant by saying &quot;looks like you'll be going up the road\r\n  for this one.&quot; Â \r\nAppellant\r\n  unsuccessfully moved the family court for a directed verdict, arguing the State\r\n  failed to present evidence of malice aforethought.Â  The family court found\r\n  Appellant guilty of murder and sentenced him to confinement in a juvenile\r\n  facility for an indeterminate amount of time not to exceed his twenty first\r\n  birthday.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the family court err in failing to direct a verdict in favor of&nbsp; Appellant?\r\n  II.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the family court err in finding the Appellant guilty of murder?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nHere,\r\n  Appellant alleges the family court erred in failing to grant him a directed\r\n  verdict because the State presented no evidence of malice aforethought.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the denial of a directed verdict, this court must view all evidence\r\n  in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C.\r\n  279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  This court will reverse the trial\r\n  court's denial of a directed verdict only if no evidence supports the ruling.Â  State\r\n    v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. 388, 399, 649 S.E.2d 41, 47 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We\r\n  will affirm the family court's denial of a directed verdict in a juvenile\r\n  delinquency matter if it is supported by any evidence.Â  In re Doe, 318\r\n  S.C. 527, 534, 458 S.E.2d 556, 561 (Ct. App. 1995); In re Bruce O., 311\r\n  S.C. 514, 515, 429 S.E.2d 858, 859 (Ct. App. 1993); but see State v.\r\n    Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 543, 243 S.E.2d 195, 197 (1978) (stating that the\r\n  trial court should direct a verdict for a defendant when the evidence only\r\n  raises a mere suspicion of guilt).\r\n&quot;Murder\r\n  is the killing of any person with malice aforethought, whether expressed or\r\n  implied.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2006).Â  Malice can be either expressed\r\n  or implied.Â  State v. Portee, 122 S.C. 298, 301, 115 S.E. 238, 239-40\r\n  (1922).Â  Accordingly, in order for this court to reverse the trial court's\r\n  denial of the directed verdict, we must find no evidence to support the trial\r\n  court's ruling on the issue of malice.Â  See Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C.\r\n  at 399, 649 S.E.2d at 47.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, applying the any evidence standard and viewing the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to the State, we find sufficient evidence supports the\r\n  family court's denial of Appellant's motion for a directed verdict.Â  Evidence\r\n  in the record demonstrates Appellant retrieved a deadly weapon from his\r\n  brother's closet, walked to another room, opened a window, and pointed the\r\n  gun.Â  Moreover, the record indicates it required six pounds of pressure to fire\r\n  the gun and the recoil on the specific firearm in question was &quot;negligible,&quot;\r\n  inferring accidental discharge of the second shot was unlikely.Â  Because the\r\n  family court could infer malice from a defendant's use of a deadly weapon[2] or from the evidence that the discharge of the weapon was likely not\r\n  accidental, this evidence was sufficient to overcome Appellant's motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  See, e.g., Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182,\r\n  189, 607 S.E.2d 82, 85 (1981) (recognizing malice may be implied from the use\r\n  of a deadly weapon).Â  Accordingly, we find no error.[3]\r\nII.&nbsp; Family Court's Finding of Guilty\r\nAppellant\r\n  next argues the family court erred in finding him delinquent because the State\r\n  failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he killed Victim with malice\r\n  aforethought.Â  We find this argument is not preserved for our review on appeal.Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  an issue must be both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142,\r\n  587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003).Â  Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â  Knight v. Waggoner, 359 S.C. 492, 496,\r\n  597 S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In this case, Appellant made no objection\r\n  to the final verdict of the family court and made no motion for a new trial.Â \r\n  Although this court has advocated excepting juvenile criminal matters from the\r\n  strict rules of issue preservation, the supreme court has declined to address\r\n  whether such an exception should be recognized.Â  See In re Arisha\r\n    K.S., 331 S.C. 288, 296, 501 S.E.2d 128, 133 (Ct. App. 1998) (inviting the\r\n  supreme court to address the setting aside of the rules of issue preservation\r\n  in the context of juvenile criminal matters).Â  Thus, this court remains bound\r\n  by this state's long-standing rules of issue preservation, and we must\r\n  therefore hold Appellant's argument is not properly before this court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the ruling of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and KONDUROS J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  At the time of\r\n  the incident, Appellant was twelve years old, stood five feet six inches tall, and\r\n  weighed over two hundred pounds.Â  Victim was ten years old.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court recently addressed and overruled a long line of case law\r\n  pertaining to jury instructions regarding the permissive inference of malice\r\n  from the use of a deadly weapon in State v. Belcher, Op. No. 26729 (S.C.\r\n  Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 12, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 44 at 14). Â After careful\r\n  review of the Belcher opinion, we do not find it controlling of this\r\n  matter. \r\n[3]Â  Generally, the\r\n  common law imposes a rebuttable presumption that a child between seven and\r\n  fourteen years of age does not have the mental capacity to commit a crime.Â  State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 546, 647 S.E.2d 144, 153-54 (2007); see State\r\n      v. Blanden, 177 S.C. 1, 21, 180 S.E. 681, 689-90 (1935) (noting with\r\n  approval the trial court's instruction to the jury on the presumption of\r\n  incapacity).Â  The State cites In Re Skinner for the proposition that the\r\n  common-law presumption of the incapacity of a minor is inapplicable in family\r\n  court proceedings because the statutory scheme provides for criminal\r\n  convictions in the family court.Â  272 S.C. 135, 137, 249 S.E.2d 746, 747 (1978).Â \r\n  While the Skinner court's reliance on the since repealed section\r\n  14-21-510(A)(1)(c) of the South Carolina Code (1976) causes this court sincere\r\n  reservation as to whether such a rule remains under the jurisprudence of this\r\n  state, Appellant neither made this an issue at trial, nor preserved it for\r\n  appellate review.Â  Although this court has advocated the setting aside of preservation\r\n  requirements in the context of juvenile criminal matters, our supreme court has\r\n  elected not to address whether such is a recognized exception to this state's\r\n  issue preservation requirements. Â See In re Arisha K.S., 331 S.C.\r\n  288, 296, 501 S.E.2d 128, 133 (Ct. App. 1998) (inviting the supreme court to\r\n  address the setting aside of the rules of issue preservation in the context of\r\n  juvenile criminal matters).Â  We therefore remain bound by the rules of\r\n  preservation in the current matter, precluding this court from addressing the\r\n  rebuttable presumption of incapacity.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4640","title":"Normandy Corporation v.

Shelton, both of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.: This declaratory judgment action stems\r\n    from a condemnation action instituted by the South Carolina Department of\r\n    Transportation (Department) to acquire approximately six acres of land from the\r\n    Normandy Corporation (Normandy) for the construction of the Carolina Bays\r\n    Parkway in Horry County.Â  After concluding that the Department was undervaluing\r\n    the condemned property on the basis that the property was located on a parcel\r\n    containing wetlands, Normandy sought an order declaring whether any of the\r\n    wetlands on the parcel fell within the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, 33\r\n    U.S.C. Â§ 1251 et seq. (CWA), and the impact, if any, of the CWA on the\r\n    parcel as of October 13, 2000, the date the condemnation action was filed.Â  The\r\n    master-in-equity ruled that, as of October 13, 2000, none of the wetlands on\r\n    the parcel fell within the jurisdiction of the CWA and that the wetlands could\r\n    legally be drained.Â  The Department now seeks review of the master's order.Â  We\r\n    affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe\r\n  parcel of property at issue in this case is located in Horry County near the\r\n  intersection of Highway 9 and Highway 57.Â  It consists of approximately 88.59\r\n  acres.Â  Normandy acquired the parcel in 1996 in a bankruptcy proceeding.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1997, Loris Hospital expressed some interest in purchasing a portion of the parcel\r\n  from Normandy.Â  In connection with the proposed sale, Normandy hired Dr. Paul Booth\r\n  to perform a wetlands delineation.Â  Dr. Booth delineated seventy-two acres of\r\n  the parcel and concluded that approximately forty-six of those acres were\r\n  wetlands.Â  According to Marguerite McClam, a licensed civil engineer who was\r\n  hired by the Department in connection with the Carolina Bays Parkway project, the\r\n  United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) subsequently &quot;certified&quot;\r\n  Dr. Booth's delineation and the certification was valid for five years.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the time that Dr. Booth performed his delineation, Normandy had done nothing\r\n  significant to the parcel.Â  Ditches around the perimeter of the parcel existed,\r\n  but they had not been maintained and their flow was blocked by beaver dams. \r\nUltimatelyÂ¸\r\n  the proposed sale to Loris Hospital was not completed, and, sometime after Dr.\r\n  Booth's delineation, Normandy cut the timber on the parcel, raked the parcel,\r\n  &quot;cleared it up,&quot; and planted a pine plantation thereon.Â \r\n  Additionally, in 1998, Normandy installed Christmas tree ditches on the parcel.Â \r\n  Normandy then began the process of having the parcel rezoned from mobile home\r\n  residential to planned unit development for commercial purposes.Â  A\r\n  redelineation was not required, and was not performed, in connection with that\r\n  process, which was completed in April 2000.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 13, 2000, the Department filed a Condemnation Notice with respect to Normandy's\r\n  parcel. Â According to Normandy's declaratory judgment complaint, the Department\r\n  sought to acquire approximately six acres of the parcel.[1]Â  The\r\n  portion of the parcel condemned by the Department provided all of the parcel's frontage\r\n  and access to Highway 9.[2]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  connection with the condemnation action, the Department retained Gordon\r\n  Murphy of the LPA Group to prepare a &quot;wetland delineation package request&quot;\r\n  for the Corps.Â  Murphy visited the site in 2001. Â Murphy's delineation was\r\n  limited to the &quot;study corridor,&quot; which consisted of 2.7 acres.Â  \r\nSometime\r\n  in 2001, the Department submitted an offer to Normandy for the portion of the\r\n  parcel subject to the condemnation action.Â  The offer was based upon the\r\n  Department's appraisal, which estimated that 50% to 75% of the parcel was comprised\r\n  of wetlands.Â  After receiving the Department's appraisal, Normandy asked Norman\r\n  Boatwright to perform a study to determine the amount of wetlands existing on\r\n  the parcel.Â  Boatwright's study was completed in 2001.Â  \r\nNormandy\r\n  subsequently asked Craig Turner to perform a more comprehensive wetlands\r\n  study.Â  Turner installed eight groundwater monitoring wells across the parcel\r\n  to document water levels and rates of drainage.Â  The wells were automated to\r\n  read water levels once daily.Â  Turner's study, which began in December 2003 and\r\n  lasted until October 2004, found that in addition to the approximately 26 acres\r\n  that had been delineated uplands by Dr. Booth, another 47.46 acres of the\r\n  parcel had been converted to uplands as a result of &quot;the drainage system\r\n  installed in 1998.&quot;Â  Thus, Turner's study concluded that roughly 73.5\r\n  acres of the 88.59 acres he delineated were uplands (approximately 83%).Â  According\r\n  to Michael Todd Smith, a partial owner of Normandy, Turner's study was &quot;almost\r\n  identical&quot; to Boatwright's.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  December 2003, Normandy filed its declaratory judgment action in circuit\r\n  court.Â  In its complaint, Normandy argued that the Department was undervaluing\r\n  the condemned portion of the parcel based upon its erroneous assumption that 50%\r\n  to 75% of the parcel was comprised of wetlands falling within the jurisdiction\r\n  of the CWA.Â  Specifically, Normandy contended that &quot;the prior accumulation\r\n  of water&quot; relied upon by the Department in making its appraisal was\r\n  largely corrected when the parcel was timbered and drainage ditches were\r\n  installed thereon.Â  Normandy therefore sought a declaration by the court as to\r\n  whether any wetlands existing on the parcel were jurisdictional (i.e., within\r\n  the jurisdiction of the CWA) and the impact, if any, of the CWA on the parcel\r\n  as of October 13, 2000, the condemnation date. Â \r\nIn\r\n  February 2004, the Department filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\r\n  12(b)(7), SCRCP, seeking dismissal of the declaratory judgment action on the\r\n  grounds that Normandy had failed to join the South Carolina Department of Health\r\n  and Environmental Control (DHEC) and the Corps as parties to the action.[3]Â  After\r\n  conducting a hearing on the matter, Judge B. Hicks Harwell denied the\r\n  Department's motion in an order issued October 27, 2004. Â Judge Harwell concluded\r\n  that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over DHEC or the Corps because\r\n  neither entity had taken any type of final agency action with respect to the\r\n  parcel.Â  Moreover, with regard to DHEC, Judge Harwell ruled that &quot;[b]asically,\r\n  the only ability DHEC has to regulate wetlands derives from its review power of\r\n  a Federal permit application under the CWA.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 25, 2006, by mutual agreement of the parties, the declaratory judgment\r\n  action was stricken from the circuit court's docket with leave to restore\r\n  pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.Â  That very same day, the matter was restored and\r\n  referred to the master pursuant to a Consent Order to Restore and Refer (Order\r\n  of Reference) issued by the circuit court. Â A trial was subsequently held\r\n  before the master on August 27, 2007. \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Normandy introduced the results of Turner's wetlands study.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Turner, who was qualified as an expert in the fields of soil science and\r\n  wetland delineation, testified that it was &quot;reasonable and probable&quot;\r\n  that his study accurately reflected the wetlands status of the parcel as of the\r\n  condemnation date.Â  He explained that the Christmas tree ditches, which were installed\r\n  prior to the condemnation date, were &quot;very effective&quot; at pulling water\r\n  out of wetlands.Â  Turner further testified that the approximately\r\n  fifteen acres of wetlands remaining on the parcel were not, in his opinion,\r\n  jurisdictional.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  an order dated November 27, 2007, the master found that Turner's study\r\n  correctly stated the status of the property as of October 13, 2000.Â  He further\r\n  held that, as of October 13, 2000, the parcel &quot;contained 73.5 acres of\r\n  uplands; contained no wetlands within the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act;\r\n  and contained 15 acres of wetlands that could be legally drained.&quot;Â  The\r\n  Department subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP.Â  The master denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master lack subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n\t\t\tdetermine the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on the \r\n\t\t\tparcel?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err by concluding that the parcel \r\n\t\t\tcontained no wetlands within the jurisdiction of the CWA?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err by concluding that the parcel \r\n\t\t\tcontained fifteen acres of wetlands that could legally be drained?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n&quot;A\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.&quot;Â  City of Hartsville v.

Fraser, 371 S.C. 512, 517 n.2, 641 S.E.2d 419, 421 n.2\r\n  (2007).\r\nA.&nbsp; Master's\r\n  Authority to Issue Ruling\r\nUnder\r\n  the Eminent Domain Procedure Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 28-2-10 to 28-2-510 (2007),\r\n  a circuit court has the power to hear a condemnation action. Â See, e.g.,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-30(8) (2007) (defining &quot;court&quot; as &quot;a\r\n  circuit court of this State&quot;).Â  Additionally, pursuant to the Uniform\r\n  Declaratory Judgments Act, a circuit court has the authority to preside over a\r\n  declaratory judgment action.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-20 (2005)\r\n  (&quot;Courts of record within their respective jurisdictions shall have power\r\n  to declare rights, status and other legal relations whether or not further\r\n  relief is or could be claimed.&quot;). Â Equity courts are considered divisions\r\n  of the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-11-15 (Supp. 2008).Â  The circuit\r\n  court may, upon application of any party or upon its own motion, &quot;direct a\r\n  reference&quot; of some or all of the causes of action in a case to a\r\n  master-in-equity.Â  Rule 53(b), SCRCP.Â  When a reference is made, the master\r\n  must enter final judgment as to the causes of action referred.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 14-11-85 (Supp. 2008). Â Once an action is referred, the master possesses all\r\n  power and authority that a circuit judge sitting without a jury would have in a\r\n  similar matter.Â  Rule 53(c), SCRCP.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the present case is a declaratory judgment action that was commenced in\r\n  connection with a condemnation action.[4]Â \r\n  In its complaint for declaratory judgment, Normandy sought a declaration regarding, inter alia, &quot;whether the wetlands, if any, are jurisdictional or\r\n  nonjurisdictional as of the date of the filing of the condemnation\r\n  action.&quot;Â  The Order of Reference did not limit the issues to be addressed\r\n  by the master; rather, it referred &quot;the case&quot; to him.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  Order of Reference authorized the master to &quot;take such testimony and make\r\n  such findings [of] fact and conclusion[s] of law&quot; as he deemed appropriate\r\n  and to &quot;enter a final judgment.&quot;Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we conclude that the issue of the amount of jurisdictional wetlands\r\n  existing on the parcel as of the condemnation date was properly before the\r\n  master. Â The issue was plainly pled by Normandy in its declaratory judgment complaint.Â \r\n  Additionally, the circuit court, acting within its statutory authority, referred\r\n  the entire declaratory judgment action to the master without any limitations.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we find that the master was authorized to make a ruling regarding the amount of\r\n  jurisdictional wetlands existing on the parcel as of the condemnation date.Â  Under\r\n  South Carolina's Constitution, private property shall not be taken for public\r\n  use without &quot;just compensation&quot; first being made for the property.Â \r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 13.Â  For the purpose of fixing just compensation,\r\n  evidence which is relevant, material and competent may be considered.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-340(A) (2007).Â  In addition to the value of the property to be\r\n  taken, any diminution in the\r\n  value of the landowner's remaining property and any benefits derived from the\r\n  proposed project may be taken into account in determining just compensation.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-370 (2007).Â  \r\nAlso,\r\n  &quot;[i]t is well settled that compensation is not limited to the value of the\r\n  property as used by the owner at the time of condemnation.&quot;Â  City of\r\n    North Charleston v. Claxton, 315 S.C. 56, 60-61, 431 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1993).Â  &quot;Rather, the owner is entitled to the value of the property\r\n  under its most advantageous or profitable use, including any use reasonably\r\n  anticipated in the near future.&quot;Â  Id. at 61, 431 S.E.2d at 613.Â  Thus,\r\n  the potential of property may be considered as an element affecting value, so\r\n  long as the potential is &quot;reasonably probable.&quot;Â  Carolina Power\r\n    &amp; Light Co. v. Copeland, 258 S.C. 206, 215, 188 S.E.2d 188, 192 (1972).\r\nImportantly,\r\n  the value of real property is &quot;commonly limited both by physical factors\r\n  and by legal or governmentally imposed restrictions.&quot; Â 19 Am. Jur. Proof\r\n  of Facts 3d 613 Â§ 1 (1993). Â &quot;Legal or governmentally imposed restrictions\r\n  include covenants, easements, zoning restrictions, environmental regulations,\r\n  subdivision ordinances, licenses and permits, floodplain restrictions, coastal\r\n  and wetland restrictions, and other laws, statutes, and ordinances.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWithout\r\n  a doubt, the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on a parcel of property\r\n  can have a considerable impact on the value of that parcel.Â  See id. at Â§ 5 (stating that the impact of wetlands on land valuation is\r\n  &quot;significant&quot;).[5]Â \r\n  If a wetland is jurisdictional and thus subject to the CWA, then the property\r\n  owner is required to obtain a permit from the Corps in order to take certain\r\n  actions, such as placing fill material into the wetland.Â  See 33 U.S.C.\r\n  Â§ 1344(a) (2000).Â  Obtaining a permit from the Corps is no small matter.Â  As\r\n  Justice Scalia has explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe burden of\r\n  federal regulation on those who would deposit fill material in locations\r\n  denominated &quot;waters of the United States&quot; is not trivial. . . . The\r\n  average applicant for an individual permit spends 788 days and $271,596 in\r\n  completing the process, and the average applicant for a nationwide permit\r\n  spends 313 days and $28,915 - not counting costs of mitigation or design\r\n  changes. . . . These costs cannot be avoided, because the Clean Water Act\r\n  &quot;impose[s] criminal liability,&quot; as well as steep civil fines, &quot;on\r\n  a broad range of ordinary industrial and commercial activities.&quot;\r\n\r\nRapanos\r\n  v. United States,\r\n  547 U.S. 715, 721 (2006) (internal citations omitted).\r\nTherefore,\r\n  because the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on a tract of land has a\r\n  significant impact on the value of that tract, evidence regarding\r\n  jurisdictional wetland amounts is relevant and material to fixing just\r\n  compensation.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that the master was authorized to make\r\n  a ruling as to the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on the parcel as\r\n  of the condemnation date so that the just compensation owed to Normandy could\r\n  ultimately be determined.Â  Cf. State v. St. Charles Airline Lands,\r\n    Inc., 871 So.2d 674 (La. Ct. App. 2004) (holding that the trial court was allowed\r\n  to consider, for the purpose of determining just compensation in a condemnation\r\n  action, expert testimony regarding whether the owner of the condemned property would\r\n  have received permits to develop wetlands existing on the property).\r\nB.&nbsp; Corps' Authority\r\n  to Make Jurisdictional Determinations\r\nThe\r\n  Department, however, argues that because federal law vests the Corps with the\r\n  authority to determine whether land consists of jurisdictional wetlands, the\r\n  master lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine the amount of\r\n  jurisdictional wetlands existing on the parcel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department misconstrues the scope of the master's decision.Â  The master's\r\n  decision, which was precipitated by a condemnation action, was made for the\r\n  limited purpose of resolving issues that bore on the value of the condemned property\r\n  as of the condemnation date.Â  Although the Corps has the authority to make jurisdictional\r\n  wetlands determinations with respect to issuing permits and approved\r\n  jurisdictional determinations (JDs) under\r\n  federal law,[6] the master's decision does not purport to grant a permit or an approved JD to\r\n  Normandy.Â  Therefore, the master's decision does not improperly infringe upon\r\n  the jurisdiction of the Corps.Â  To hold otherwise would necessitate the Corps'\r\n  involvement in every condemnation action in which the amount of jurisdictional\r\n  wetlands on the condemned property was in dispute.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department further contends that an approved JD issued by the Corps with\r\n  respect to Dr. Booth's 1997 delineation was &quot;the final word&quot;\r\n  regarding the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on the parcel and that\r\n  Normandy's failure to adhere to the appeals process set forth in 33 C.F.R. Â§Â§\r\n  331.1 to 331.12 precludes it from now utilizing the state court system to\r\n  &quot;overrule&quot; the Corps determination.\r\nFor\r\n  several reasons, the Department's argument is unpersuasive.Â  First, the Department's\r\n  argument is at odds with section 28-2-440 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Act,\r\n  which provides that &quot;[i]n all condemnation actions, the date of\r\n  valuation is the date of the filing of the Condemnation Notice.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-440 (2007) (emphasis added).Â  Here, Normandy presented\r\n  evidence showing that, between the time of Dr. Booth's delineation and the\r\n  filing of the Condemnation Notice, Normandy installed Christmas tree ditches on\r\n  the parcel that reduced the amount of wetlands existing thereon.[7]Â  To simply disregard\r\n  that evidence, as the Department urges, would be inconsistent with section\r\n  28-2-440.\r\nSecond,\r\n  the record provided by the Department does not demonstrate what the Corps'\r\n  conclusions were with regard to the amount of jurisdictional wetlands\r\n  existing on the parcel.Â  The approved JD is not in the record.Â  Moreover, while\r\n  McClam testified that the Corps &quot;certified&quot; Dr. Booth's delineation, Dr.\r\n  Booth's delineation is not in the record either.Â  Furthermore, although there\r\n  is evidence that Dr. Booth determined that approximately forty-six acres of the\r\n  parcel were wetlands, the record does not indicate how many of those acres he\r\n  found to be jurisdictional under the CWA.Â  Thus, the Department has failed to\r\n  meet its burden of providing this Court with a sufficient record upon which to\r\n  make its decision.Â  See Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co.,\r\n  363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d 485, 487-88 (2005) (appellant has burden of\r\n  providing sufficient record).\r\nThird,\r\n  to the extent that the Department is arguing that the doctrine of res judicata or\r\n  collateral estoppel barred the master from making a jurisdictional\r\n  determination as to the parcel's wetlands, the Court notes that &quot;the\r\n  application of res judicata and collateral estoppel principles are not matters\r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Mr. T v. Ms. T, 378 S.C. 127, 133,\r\n  662 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2008). Â Rather, &quot;[t]he defense of preclusion\r\n  by a former judgment is an affirmative defense which ordinarily must be\r\n  specially pleaded.&quot;Â  Wagner v. Wagner, 286 S.C. 489, 491, 335\r\n  S.E.2d 246, 247 (Ct. App. 1985). Â Here, the Department did not specifically raise\r\n  the issue of the preclusive effect of the approved JD, and the master did not rule\r\n  on the issue.Â  Therefore, the issue cannot be raised on appeal.Â  See Duckett,\r\n  374 S.C. at 465, 649 S.E.2d at 82 (party cannot raise defense of collateral\r\n  estoppel for the first time on appeal); S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina\r\n    Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review, issue must have been: (1) raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court, (2) raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a timely\r\n  manner, and (4) raised to the trial court with sufficient specificity).\r\nFinally,\r\n  the above-referenced federal regulations cited by the Department did not become\r\n  effective until March 28, 2000.Â  See Final Rule Establishing an\r\n  Administrative Appeal Process for the Regulatory Program of the Corps of\r\n  Engineers, 65 Fed. Reg. 16486 (March 28, 2000).[8]Â \r\n  Moreover, the regulations expressly state that &quot;[a]ffected parties . . .\r\n  may not appeal approved JDs dated on or before March 28, 2000.&quot;Â  33 C.F.R.\r\n  Â§ 331.6(e) (2000).Â  Although there is nothing in the record that shows when the\r\n  Corps certified Dr. Booth's delineation, as noted above, Dr. Booth's\r\n  delineation was completed in 1997.Â  Thus, it is questionable whether the\r\n  regulations were in effect at the time that Dr. Booth's delineation was certified.[9]Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Federal\r\n  preemption \r\nThe\r\n  Department also argues that the CWA preempted the master from making a\r\n  determination regarding the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on the\r\n  parcel as of the condemnation date. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nCourts\r\n  should not lightly infer preemption.Â  Int'l Paper Co. v. Ouellete, 479\r\n  U.S. 481, 491 (1987).Â  Federal law may preempt state law in three ways: (1) Congress\r\n  may expressly define the extent to which it preempts state law; (2) Congress\r\n  may occupy a field of regulation, &quot;impliedly&quot; preempting state law;\r\n  or (3) a state law may be preempted to the extent it &quot;conflicts&quot; with\r\n  federal law. Â Prof'l Samplers, Inc. v. S.C. Employment Sec. Comm'n, 334\r\n  S.C. 392, 397, 513 S.E.2d 374, 377 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999). Â As to the third method, &quot;conflict arises when either\r\n  compliance with both laws is impossible or when the state law frustrates the\r\n  federal purpose and creates an obstacle to the fulfillment of federal\r\n  objectives.&quot; Â Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  the Department has not pointed to any provision of the CWA that expressly\r\n  prohibits state courts from making wetlands jurisdictional determinations for\r\n  the purpose of valuing a property in a condemnation action.Â  Moreover, the Department\r\n  has not cited, and we have not found, any cases that hold that the CWA &quot;impliedly&quot;\r\n  precludes state courts from making such determinations.Â  Although courts have\r\n  held that the CWA preempts state regulation of certain environmental matters,[10] the master's\r\n  decision does not regulate conduct; rather, it merely rules on the status of the\r\n  parcel as of the condemnation date.Â  Likewise, while courts have held that the CWA\r\n  preempts state nuisance law in certain instances,[11] the\r\n  present case does not involve a nuisance action.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the Department has failed to establish that the master's decision\r\n  &quot;conflicts&quot; with the CWA.Â  The Department has not contended that\r\n  compliance with both the master's order and the CWA is impossible.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  master's decision would not be binding on the Corps in any future permitting\r\n  matter given that it ruled on the wetlands status of the parcel as of October\r\n  13, 2000 (over 9 years ago) and that the Corps was neither a party to the\r\n  declaratory judgment action nor in privity with any party.[12]Â  Thus, the\r\n  master's decision does not frustrate a federal purpose or create an obstacle to\r\n  the fulfillment of federal objectives.\r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we conclude that the CWA did not preempt the master from making\r\n  a determination as the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on the parcel\r\n  as of the condemnation date.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\n  of CWA over Wetlands on Parcel\r\nNext, the\r\n  Department contends that the master erred by concluding that the parcel\r\n  consisted of no wetlands within the jurisdiction of the CWA.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 404(a)\r\n  of the CWA regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into &quot;navigable\r\n  waters.&quot;Â  33 U.S.C. Â§ 1344(a) (2000).Â  Under the CWA, the term &quot;navigable\r\n  waters&quot; means &quot;the waters of the United States, including the\r\n  territorial seas.&quot; Â 33 U.S.C. Â§ 1362(7) (2000).Â  In its regulations, the\r\n  Corps has defined the phrase &quot;waters of the United States&quot; to include,\r\n  among other things, waters susceptible to use in interstate commerce,\r\n  tributaries thereto, and wetlands that are &quot;adjacent to&quot; such waters\r\n  and tributaries.Â  See 33 C.F.R. Â§ 328.3(a) (2000). \r\nNumerous\r\n  cases have addressed the meaning of the phrase &quot;waters of the United\r\n  States&quot; and the validity of the Corps' regulatory definition of that term.\r\n  Â The U.S. Supreme Court first tackled these issues in United States v.\r\n    Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985), a case involving\r\n  wetlands that abutted a navigable waterway.Â  In that case, the Court upheld the\r\n  Corps' construction of Section 404 as extending federal jurisdiction to wetlands\r\n  adjacent to the &quot;waters of the United States.&quot;Â  Noting that choosing where\r\n  &quot;water ends and land begins&quot; was &quot;no easy task,&quot;[13] the Court concluded\r\n  that it was &quot;reasonable for the Corps to interpret the term 'waters' to\r\n  encompass wetlands adjacent to waters as more conventionally defined.&quot; Â Id. at 133. Â In making its ruling, the Court did not express any opinion on &quot;the\r\n  question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material\r\n  into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water.&quot;Â  Id. at 131 n.8.\r\nSince Riverside Bayview, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued two major decisions\r\n  construing the phrase &quot;navigable waters,&quot; both of which were decided\r\n  after the Department filed its Condemnation Notice in October of 2000: Â Solid\r\n    Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531\r\n  U.S. 159 (2001) (SWANCC) and Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S.\r\n  715 (2006).Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; SWANCC\r\nIn SWANCC, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the issue of whether wholly intrastate ponds are subject to federal jurisdiction under Section 404(a) of the CWA based\r\n  upon the presence of migratory birds.Â  In that case, the owners of the property\r\n  containing the ponds contacted the Corps to determine if a federal landfill\r\n  permit under Section 404(a) of the CWA was required for their proposed use of\r\n  the property as a disposal site for nonhazardous solid waste.Â  Upon being\r\n  informed that a number of migratory bird species had been observed at the site,\r\n  the Corps asserted jurisdiction over the site pursuant to 33 C.F.R. Â§\r\n  328.3(a)(3) (1999) and its &quot;Migratory Bird Rule.&quot;[14]Â  Although\r\n  the petitioner made several proposals to mitigate the likely displacement of\r\n  the migratory birds, the Corps refused to issue a Â§ 404(a) permit.Â  On appeal\r\n  of the matter, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the &quot;Migratory Bird\r\n  Rule&quot; was not fairly supported by the CWA and that federal jurisdiction\r\n  did not extend to &quot;nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters.&quot;Â  SWANCC,\r\n  531 U.S. at 167, 170-72.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rapanos\r\nRapanos was a consolidation\r\n  of two Sixth Circuit cases:Â  Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v.\r\n    United States.Â  In Rapanos, the Supreme Court addressed whether four\r\n  Michigan wetlands, which were located near ditches or man-made drains that\r\n  eventually &quot;empt[ied] into&quot; navigable waters, constituted\r\n  &quot;waters of the United States&quot; within the meaning of the CWA. Â Rapanos,\r\n  547 U.S. at 729.Â  The Court was unable to reach a consensus in the case; the\r\n  decision was 4-1-4 and included a plurality opinion by Justice Scalia, a\r\n  concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy, and a dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens.Â \r\n  As noted below, because the plurality's opinion and Justice Kennedy's\r\n  concurrence each set forth a different test for determining CWA jurisdiction, courts\r\n  interpreting the Rapanos decision have disagreed as to how to apply it.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Plurality's OpinionÂ  \r\nThe\r\n  plurality concluded that two findings were required to establish that the\r\n  wetlands at issue were covered under the CWA.Â  First, it was necessary to find that\r\n  the channel adjacent to the wetland was a &quot;wate[r] of the United States,&quot;\r\n  which the plurality construed as &quot;a relatively permanent body of water\r\n  connected to traditional interstate navigable waters.&quot;Â  Rapanos,\r\n  547 U.S. at 742.[15] Â According to the plurality, the phrase &quot;waters of the United States&quot;\r\n  did not include &quot;channels through which water flows intermittently or\r\n  ephemerally, or channels that periodically provide drainage for\r\n  rainfall.&quot;Â  Id. at 739.Â  \r\nSecond,\r\n  it was essential to find that the wetland had a &quot;continuous surface\r\n  connection&quot; with the adjacent channel, &quot;making it difficult to determine\r\n  where the 'water' ends and the 'wetland' begins.&quot;Â  Id. at 742.Â  The\r\n  plurality explained that &quot;[a]n intermittent, physically remote hydrologic\r\n  connection&quot; would be inadequate to meet this prong of its test.Â  See id.\r\n2.&nbsp; Justice Kennedy's\r\n  Concurrence\r\nJustice Kennedy set\r\n  forth a different test for analyzing whether the wetlands at issue in Rapanos fell under the jurisdiction of the CWA.Â  Seizing upon language contained in SWANCC,[16] he stated that\r\n  &quot;the Corps' jurisdiction over wetlands depends upon the existence of a\r\n  significant nexus between the wetlands in question and navigable waters in a\r\n  traditional sense.&quot;Â  Id. at 779.Â  He further explained that:\r\n\r\n\t[W]etlands\r\n  possess the requisite nexus, and thus come within the statutory phrase\r\n  &quot;navigable waters,&quot; if the wetlands, either alone or in combination\r\n  with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical,\r\n  physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily\r\n  understood as &quot;navigable.&quot; Â When, in contrast, wetlands' effects on\r\n  water quality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall outside the zone\r\n  fairly encompassed by the statutory term &quot;navigable waters.&quot; \r\n\r\nId. at 780.\r\nThere\r\n  has been disagreement among courts as to how to apply the fragmented Rapanos decision. Â Compare N. Cal. River Watch v. City of Healdsburg, 496\r\n  F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1225 (2008)\r\n  (holding that Justice Kennedy's test provides the controlling rule for\r\n  determining jurisdiction) with U.S. v. Johnson, 467 F.3d 56,\r\n  60-66 (1st Cir. 2006), cert denied, 128 S. Ct. 375 (2007)\r\n  (holding that jurisdiction exists if either the plurality's test or Kennedy's\r\n  test is met).Â  In the present case, it is unnecessary for us to take a position\r\n  on this issue because we conclude that, under either the plurality's test or\r\n  Justice Kennedy's test, the wetlands on the parcel are nonjurisdictional.Â  Â \r\nC.&nbsp; Evidence\r\n  Presented at Trial\r\n1.&nbsp; Normandy\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Normandy introduced the results of Turner's study, which found that roughly\r\n  fifteen acres of the 88.59-acre parcel consisted of wetlands (approximately\r\n  17%).Â  The study also concluded that those fifteen acres of wetlands could be\r\n  converted to uplands through the installation of additional ditching.Â  Although\r\n  Turner did not begin his study until 2003, he testified that it was &quot;reasonable\r\n  and probable&quot; that his study accurately reflected the wetlands status of the\r\n  parcel as of October 13, 2000, the condemnation date.Â  Turner's testimony was\r\n  buttressed by that of Normandy's owner, Smith, who testified that the findings\r\n  in Turner's study were &quot;almost identical&quot; to those contained in the\r\n  study conducted by Boatwright in 2001. \r\nAs\r\n  to whether the wetlands on the parcel were jurisdictional, Turner testified\r\n  that, in his opinion, none of the wetlands were jurisdictional.Â  As support for\r\n  his opinion, Turner testified that the closest traditional navigable water to\r\n  the parcel was the Waccamaw River, which he estimated was five to six miles away.Â \r\n  He also testified that the Christmas tree ditches installed on the parcel\r\n  &quot;dry up quite radically&quot; and that, even in abnormally heavy periods\r\n  of rainfall, they did not have significant flow for a continuous three-month\r\n  period but rather were &quot;bone dry.&quot;Â  Finally, Turner testified that, in\r\n  his opinion, neither any of the ditches nor any of the areas that still met the\r\n  wetlands criteria had a significant nexus with a traditional navigable water.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; The Department\r\nThe\r\n  Department relied primarily upon the testimony of McClam, who was qualified as an\r\n  expert in civil engineering and hydrology.Â  In contrast to the evidence\r\n  presented by Normandy, McClam testified that approximately 56% of the parcel\r\n  was wetlands. Â However, she acknowledged that her opinion was based upon\r\n  Murphy's delineation, which covered only 2.7 acres of the parcel, and Dr.\r\n  Booth's delineation, which was conducted before Normandy installed the\r\n  Christmas tree ditches. Â Moreover, on cross-examination, McClam admitted\r\n  that she did not personally conduct any tests on the parcel, and that, while\r\n  others working on the Carolina Bays Parkway project did do some soil borings,\r\n  their work was limited to the study corridor.Â  \r\nMcClam\r\n  also testified that it was her opinion that the wetlands portion of the parcel\r\n  was jurisdictional &quot;based upon its connection to canals and tributaries.&quot;Â \r\n  However, McClam never specifically testified that the wetlands on the parcel\r\n  had a &quot;continuous surface connection&quot; with any of the canals\r\n  or tributaries she mentioned.Â  Nor did McClam expressly testify that a\r\n  &quot;significant nexus&quot; existed between the wetlands on the parcel and a traditional\r\n  navigable water.Â  Furthermore, while McClam testified that she visited the\r\n  parcel, she did not testify that she inspected the entire parcel, even when\r\n  asked by Normandy's counsel.Â  \r\nMcClam\r\n  further testified that &quot;the nearest water course&quot; to the parcel was\r\n  Bellamy Branch and that Bellamy Branch ultimately led to the Waccamaw River.Â \r\n  However, McClam failed to provide specific testimony as to the proximity of\r\n  Bellamy Branch to the parcel.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp; Analysis\r\nWhere\r\n  an expert's testimony is based upon facts sufficient to form the basis for an\r\n  opinion, the trier of fact determines its probative value.Â  Small v. Pioneer\r\n    Machinery, Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 470, 494 S.E.2d 835, 846 (Ct. App. 1997).Â \r\n  &quot;This Court cannot judge the credibility or weight of the testimony on\r\n  appeal.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  the evidence in the record adequately supports the master's conclusion that, as\r\n  of October 13, 2000, the parcel contained no wetlands within the jurisdiction\r\n  of the CWA.Â  Turner's testimony demonstrated that the wetlands did not have a\r\n  &quot;continuous surface connection&quot; with any &quot;relatively\r\n  permanent&quot; body of water and that the Rapanos plurality's test for\r\n  jurisdiction was therefore not met.Â  Turner's testimony also showed that there\r\n  was not a significant nexus between the wetlands and a traditional navigable\r\n  water and that Justice Kennedy's jurisdictional test was not met either.Â  Although\r\n  McClam's testimony contradicted some of the testimony presented by Turner, she\r\n  did not investigate the parcel as thoroughly as Turner did.Â  Therefore, it was\r\n  reasonable for the master to rely on Turner's testimony rather than McClam's.\r\nThe\r\n  Department nonetheless contends that Turner's testimony failed to sufficiently establish\r\n  that the wetlands were nonjurisdictional.Â  Specifically, the Department points\r\n  to Turner's testimony during cross-examination in which Turner admitted that he\r\n  did not know whether a certain canal on the parcel connected to the Waccamaw\r\n  River.Â  The Department claims that this information was crucial to determining\r\n  whether the wetlands were covered under the CWA.\r\nHowever,\r\n  there is no clear evidence in the truncated record that the canal in question had\r\n  any connection to the wetlands portion of the parcel.[17]Â  Indeed,\r\n  if anything, the record appears to show that the canal was not connected to the\r\n  parcel's wetlands.Â  For instance, during direct examination, Turner testified\r\n  that there was a canal located in the uplands area of the parcel.Â  He also testified\r\n  that the only ditch on the parcel that kept a substantial nexus with the canal was\r\n  a ditch coming off the Carolina Bays Parkway (Highway 31) into which the\r\n  Department had placed water from the Parkway.Â  Turner further testified that none\r\n  of the areas that still met the wetland criteria were adjacent to that ditch.Â  Thus,\r\n  even if the canal could be construed as a tributary to the Waccamaw River, Turner's\r\n  testimony seems to support the conclusion that the canal did not have any sort\r\n  of connection or nexus to the wetlands on the parcel.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department also contends that Turner acknowledged that, on the date of\r\n  condemnation, the parcel's wetlands may have been connected to tidal\r\n  waters downstream.[18]Â \r\n  Specifically, the Department points to the following exchange between Normandy's\r\n  counsel and Turner: \r\n\r\n\tQ:Â  And based on\r\n  that, are any of the areas that still meet the wetland criteria shown on\r\n  Exhibit 4, in your expert opinion, under the jurisdiction of the federal\r\n  government?\r\n\tA:Â  No sir, they're\r\n  not because I don't believe that any of these have a significant nexus to the\r\n  tidal waters downstream, so none of them, these areas may meet the criteria\r\n  right now.Â  They may have met the criteria on the date of the take, but\r\n  the way the law, case law reads now, you can argue that none of these wetlands\r\n  have a significant nexus, and are therefore non-jurisdictional.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  disagree with the Department's interpretation of this testimony.Â  In our view, Turner\r\n  was not conceding that the wetlands may have been connected to tidal waters\r\n  downstream on the condemnation date.Â  Rather, he was simply acknowledging that, under the case law that existed on the condemnation date, the wetlands\r\n  might have been considered jurisdictional.[19] Â Importantly, the Department does not\r\n  contend that SWANCC and Rapanos, both of which were issued after\r\n  the condemnation date, are inapplicable to this case. Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Legality\r\n  of Wetlands Drainage\r\nFinally,\r\n  the Department contends that the master erred by concluding that, as of the\r\n  condemnation date, the parcel contained fifteen acres of wetlands that could\r\n  legally be drained.Â  Specifically, the Department argues that even if the\r\n  parcel is not subject to regulation under the CWA, it is subject to state\r\n  regulation by the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) as an\r\n  isolated wetland. Â \r\nWe\r\n  find no reversible error here.Â  In his order, the master held that the issue of\r\n  &quot;DHEC's alleged jurisdiction&quot; over the wetlands was no longer before\r\n  the court because it had previously been decided by Judge Harwell in his\r\n  October 2004 order.Â  The Department has not challenged the master's ruling.Â  Therefore,\r\n  it is the law of the case, regardless of its correctness. Â See Buckner\r\n    v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 160-61, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544\r\n  (1970) (holding that an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the\r\n  case).Â  Accordingly, because OCRM is a part of DHEC,[20] we\r\n  conclude that the master did not err by failing to consider whether the parcel\r\n  is subject to state regulation by OCRM as an isolated wetland.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the master's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The\r\n  Condemnation Notice is not included in the record.\r\n[2] The\r\n  condemnation action did not affect the parcel's access to Highway 57.Â  \r\n[3] Rule 12(b)(7),\r\n  SCRCP, provides that &quot;[e]very defense, in law or fact, to a cause of\r\n  action in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or\r\n  third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one\r\n  is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the\r\n  pleader be made by motion: . . . (7) failure to join a party under Rule\r\n  19.&quot;Â  \r\n[4] The underlying\r\n  condemnation action is currently pending in Horry County. \r\n[5] Although the\r\n  appraisal is not in the record, in the present case, the Department does not dispute\r\n  Normandy's claim that the Department appraised the parcel at a lower value\r\n  based upon its conclusion that 50% to 75% of the parcel consisted of\r\n  jurisdictional wetlands. \r\n[6] The term\r\n  &quot;approved jurisdictional determination&quot; means &quot;a Corps document\r\n  stating the presence or absence of waters of the United States on a parcel or a\r\n  written statement and map identifying the limits of waters of the United States\r\n  on a parcel.&quot;Â  33 C.F.R. Â§ 331.2 (2000). \r\n[7] In his order,\r\n  the master ruled that the ditching was &quot;indisputably legal.&quot;Â  Although\r\n  the Department has challenged that ruling in its reply brief, this Court will\r\n  not address the issue of the legality of the ditching given that it was not set\r\n  forth in the statement of issues on appeal in the Department's initial brief.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which\r\n  is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot;); see also Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  689, 692 (Ct. App. 2001) (issue cannot be raised for the first time in a reply\r\n  brief).Â  \r\n[8] Although a previous\r\n  version of the regulations was in effect prior to March 28, 2000, it did not\r\n  apply to approved JDs.Â  See 33 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 331.1 to 331.12 (1999). \r\n[9] In fact, even\r\n  if the regulations were in effect, the preamble to the regulations states that\r\n  it is the position of the federal government that &quot;jurisdictional\r\n  determinations are not ripe for [judicial] review until a landowner who\r\n  disagrees with a JD has gone through the permitting process.&quot;Â  Final Rule\r\n  Establishing an Administrative Appeal Process for the Regulatory Program of the\r\n  Corps of Engineers, 65 Fed. Reg. at 16488.Â  Additionally, the preamble notes\r\n  that, because physical circumstances can change over time, &quot;JDs are not\r\n  necessarily 'final' even as an administrative matter.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Based\r\n  on the foregoing, it seems rather doubtful that the Corps' decision to certify\r\n  Dr. Booth's delineation constituted a final determination entitled to\r\n  preclusive effect.Â  See Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 135, 666\r\n  S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008) (issue preclusion applies when an issue has been &quot;actually\r\n  litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\n[10] See Chasm\r\n  Hydro, Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation, 58 A.D.3d 1100\r\n  (N.Y. 2009) (holding that Federal Power Act and CWA largely preempted the field\r\n  of regulating hydroelectric facilities).Â  Â \r\n[11] See Ouellette,\r\n  479 U.S. 481 (holding that CWA preempted Vermont nuisance law to extent that\r\n  Vermont law sought to impose liability on New York point source).\r\n[12] &quot;Under the\r\n  doctrine of collateral estoppel, once a final judgment on the merits has been\r\n  reached in a prior claim, the relitigation of those issues actually and\r\n  necessarily litigated and determined in the first suit are precluded as to the\r\n  parties and their privies in any subsequent action based upon a different claim.&quot;Â  Roberts v. Recovery Bureau, Inc., 316 S.C. 492, 495-96, 450 S.E.2d 616,\r\n  619 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  &quot;The term 'privy,' when applied to a judgment or\r\n  decree, means one so identified in interest with another that he represents the\r\n  same legal right.&quot; Â Id. at 496; 450 S.E.2d at 619.Â  Here, the\r\n  Department is a state agency whose &quot;functions and purposes&quot; are the\r\n  &quot;the systematic planning, construction, maintenance, and operation of the\r\n  state highway system and the development of a statewide mass transit system\r\n  that is consistent with the needs and desires of the public.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 57-1-30(A) (Supp. 2008).Â  The Department's primary concern in this case was\r\n  to pay a fair price for the parcel.Â  In our opinion, the Department was not in\r\n  privity with the Corps, a federal agency charged specifically with the duties\r\n  of environmental regulation under the CWA.Â  See 33 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1319(g)(1)(B), 1344\r\n  (2000).Â  \r\n[13] Id. at 132.\r\n[14] The\r\n  &quot;Migratory Bird Rule&quot; is set forth in the Final Rule for Regulatory\r\n  Programs of the Corps of Engineers, 51 Fed. Reg. 41206, 41217 (November 13, 1986).\r\n[15] As the\r\n  plurality noted, the traditional definition of the term &quot;navigable\r\n  waters&quot; required that the waters be navigable in fact or capable of being\r\n  rendered so.Â  Rapanos, 547 U.S. at 730 (citing The Daniel Ball,\r\n  77 U.S. 557, 563 (1870)).\r\n[16] In SWANCC,\r\n  the Court explained its decision in Riverside Bayview by stating that\r\n  &quot;[i]t was the significant nexus between the wetlands and 'navigable\r\n  waters' that informed our reading of the CWA in Riverside Bayview Homes.&quot;Â  SWANCC, 531 U.S. at 167.Â  \r\n[17] Among many\r\n  other pages, the first few pages of Turner's cross-examination are missing from\r\n  the trial transcript. Â As a result, the Court is unable to determine the\r\n  precise location of the canal.Â  \r\n[18] The Corps'\r\n  regulatory definition of &quot;waters of the United States&quot; expressly\r\n  includes &quot;waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.&quot; Â See 33 C.F.R. Â§ 328.3(a)(1) (2000).\r\n[19] For instance,\r\n  prior to SWANCC, the Corps relied upon the mere presence of migratory\r\n  birds to establish federal jurisdiction over wetlands.Â  Moreover, as noted by\r\n  Justice Scalia in Rapanos, even after SWANCC, courts continued to\r\n  uphold broad assertions of jurisdiction by the Corps.Â  See Rapanos,\r\n  547 U.S. at 726-727 and the cases cited therein.\r\n[20] See, e.g., S.C.

Hodge, Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Florence Evans appeals her convictions for three counts of\r\n  involuntary manslaughter, arguing the trial court erred in denying her motion\r\n  to dismiss the charges against her because her constitutional right to a speedy\r\n  trial was violated by the twelve-year delay in bringing her case to trial.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 4, 1994,\r\n  Evans' trailer caught fire, killing her three small children.Â  Evans was not in\r\n  the home at the time of the fire.Â  An initial test of the site revealed the\r\n  presence of a flammable substance in the debris.Â  When police first questioned\r\n  Evans on March 14, 1994, she told them she had lit a kerosene heater in the\r\n  home while her children were sleeping and had gone next door to visit her\r\n  sister.Â  She said that minutes after arriving at her sister's house, she saw\r\n  her trailer in flames and ran home in an attempt to save her children.Â  However, after several hours of\r\n  questioning, Evans gave a written statement to the police that she\r\n  intentionally &quot;dropped a lit piece of paper on the floor,&quot; went to\r\n  her sister's house, and &quot;waited about two hours until someone saw the\r\n  fire.&quot;Â  The officers immediately placed Evans under arrest, and on April\r\n  18, 1994, she was indicted on three counts of murder.\r\nPublic Defender\r\n  Jay Hodge was assigned to Evans' case; however, in 1994 or 1996 he was elected\r\n  Solicitor and was conflicted from the case.Â  The case was transferred to the\r\n  Attorney General's Office as a conflict case, and Attorney General David Avant\r\n  was assigned to represent the State.Â  On March 25, 1998, Burnie Ballard was\r\n  appointed as Evans' counsel, and on April 29, 1998, Evans filed a motion for\r\n  speedy trial.\r\nOn May 4, 1998,\r\n  the trial court held a Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), hearing to\r\n  determine the admissibility of Evans' oral and written statements to police on March\r\n  14, 1994.Â  The trial court suppressed Evans' statements after finding there was\r\n  the &quot;functional equivalent of interrogation&quot; and Evans was\r\n  &quot;tantamount to being in custody.&quot;[1]Â  The trial judge granted the State\r\n  permission to take an interlocutory appeal of its order suppressing Evans'\r\n  statements.Â  On June 12, 2000, the Court of Appeals filed an opinion affirming\r\n  the order suppressing Evans' statements; however, the State filed a petition\r\n  for rehearing, which was granted.Â  As a result, on January 2, 2001, the Court\r\n  of Appeals withdrew its previous opinion and filed a new opinion, reversing the\r\n  trial court's suppression order and remanding the case to the trial court for\r\n  entry of a more definite suppression ruling as to whether Evans was in\r\n  custody.Â  The Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari to review the\r\n  Court of Appeals' decision on September 27, 2001.Â  On June 9, 2003, the Supreme\r\n  Court reversed the Court of Appeals, finding the trial court properly\r\n  suppressed Evans' statements because she gave them in a custodial interrogation,\r\n  and she should have been given Miranda warnings.[2]Â  The State\r\n  filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied by the court, and the\r\n  remittitur was sent to the trial court on July 15, 2003.\r\nOn June 18, 2003,\r\n  the Attorney General's Office transferred the case to the Fifth Circuit\r\n  Solicitor's Office, and Assistant Solicitor David Pascoe was assigned to the\r\n  case.Â  However, Pascoe was elected as First Circuit Solicitor in 2004, and\r\n  although he took the case with him, he never personally appeared in court.Â  On\r\n  March 29, 2005, Judge Lockemy heard and denied Evans' motion for speedy trial.Â \r\n  That same day, Evans was indicted on three counts of homicide by child abuse.Â \r\n  Evans filed a motion to reconsider on April 8, 2005.Â  On January 13, 2006,\r\n  Evans' case was transferred from the Fifth Circuit Solicitor's Office to the\r\n  Eleventh Circuit Solicitor's Office.Â  Judge Lockemy heard Evans' motion for\r\n  reconsideration of the speedy trial motion on October 16, 2006, and again\r\n  denied the motion.Â  That same month, on October 31, 2006, Evans was indicted on\r\n  three counts of homicide by child abuse and three counts of involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.\r\nEvans' trial was\r\n  held on December 11, 2006.Â  That morning, before trial, Evans filed a motion\r\n  for violation of due process based on delay for the indictments for involuntary\r\n  manslaughter and homicide by child abuse.Â  At the trial, Evans also requested\r\n  Judge Lockemy reconsider his denial of her motion for speedy trial.Â  Judge\r\n  Lockemy denied both motions.Â  Judge Lockemy granted Evans' motion for directed\r\n  verdict on three counts of homicide by child abuse, and the jury found Evans\r\n  guilty of three counts of involuntary manslaughter.Â  He sentenced Evans to two\r\n  concurrent five-year terms for two counts of involuntary manslaughter, and one\r\n  consecutive five-year term for the third count of involuntary manslaughter.Â \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal\r\n  cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v.\r\n    Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The court is bound by\r\n  the findings of the trial court unless they are unsupported by the evidence,\r\n  clearly wrong, or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Williams, 326\r\n  S.C. 130, 135, 485 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1997).Â  The reviewing &quot;[c]ourt does not\r\n  re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence but simply determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by\r\n  any evidence.&quot;Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEvans argues the\r\n  trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss the charges because her constitutional\r\n  right to a speedy trial was violated by the twelve-year delay in bringing her\r\n  case to trial.Â  We disagree. \r\nA criminal\r\n  defendant is guaranteed the right to a speedy trial.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI;\r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14; State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 548, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 144, 155 (2007).Â  &quot;This right 'is designed to minimize the\r\n  possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but\r\n  nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while\r\n  released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and\r\n  the presence of unresolved criminal charges.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting U.S.\r\n    v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 8 (1982)).Â  There is no universal test to\r\n  determine whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial has been violated.Â  State\r\n    v. Waites, 270 S.C. 104, 107, 240 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1978).Â  \r\nA reviewing court\r\n  should consider four factors when determining whether a defendant has been\r\n  deprived of his or her right to a speedy trial: 1) length of the delay; 2)\r\n  reason for the delay; 3) defendant's assertion of the right; and 4) prejudice\r\n  to the defendant.Â  Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972); see\r\n    also State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 75, 480 S.E.2d 64, 70 (1997).Â \r\n  These four factors are related and must be considered together with any other\r\n  relevant circumstances.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 533.Â  &quot;Accordingly,\r\n  the determination that a defendant has been deprived of this right is not based\r\n  on the passage of a specific period of time, but instead is analyzed in terms\r\n  of the circumstances of each case, balancing the conduct of the prosecution and\r\n  the defense.&quot;Â  Pittman, 373 S.C. at 549, 647 S.E.2d at 155.Â \r\n  However, in Doggett v. U.S., 505 U.S. 647, 652 n.1 (1992), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court suggested in dicta that a delay of more than a year is\r\n  &quot;presumptively prejudicial.&quot;Â  Also, in State v. Waites, our\r\n  supreme court found a two-year and four-month delay was sufficient to trigger\r\n  further review.Â  Waites, 270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653.Â  Therefore,\r\n  &quot;a delay may be so lengthy as to require a finding of presumptive\r\n  prejudice, and thus trigger the analysis of the other factors.&quot;Â  Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 549, 647 S.E.2d at 155.\r\nEvans asserts the\r\n  twelve-year delay in bringing her case to trial was unreasonable and violated\r\n  her right to a speedy trial.Â  She claims she was prejudiced by the delay in the\r\n  loss of four of her witnesses: Alberta Tillman, Dickie Allen, Inez Robinson,\r\n  and Clay Wilson.Â  Tillman had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2003\r\n  and was not competent to testify.Â  Allen had passed away in February 2006, and\r\n  Robinson had died in August 1998.Â  Evans also was unable to locate Wilson.Â  She\r\n  alleges the delays by the State in prosecuting the case were arbitrary and\r\n  unreasonable because &quot;placing running for solicitor over one's present\r\n  duties is not an acceptable excuse, and it does not trump [Evans'] rights to a\r\n  speedy trial.&quot;Â  She also asserts that under the totality of the\r\n  circumstances, it should be taken into account that the State's appeal of the\r\n  suppression order was unsuccessful.\r\nEvans filed her\r\n  first motion for speedy trial on April 29, 1998; however, the motion was not\r\n  ruled upon until March 29, 2005.Â  At the March 29, 2005 hearing, the State\r\n  asserted the reason for the delay in 1994 after Hodge was conflicted from the\r\n  case was the result of the Attorney General's office having problems scheduling\r\n  the trial with the Fourth Circuit Solicitor's Office.Â  Regarding the delay in\r\n  2003, the State asserted that then Assistant Solicitor Pascoe was running for\r\n  Solicitor of the First Circuit, and he had a &quot;pretty hefty caseload&quot;\r\n  at the time.Â  During the hearing, Judge Lockemy considered the Barker factors in making his decision.Â  He noted that the case had been delayed for a\r\n  long time, but he did not &quot;find any neglectful delay prejudicial to the\r\n  defense to any great degree other than the fact in and of itself [it has] been\r\n  [twelve] years.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  Judge Lockemy noted the reasons for the delay included that: (1) the case was\r\n  transferred from Public Defender Hodge to the Attorney General's office due to\r\n  Hodge's election as Solicitor; (2) Evans' statement was suppressed; (3) the\r\n  suppression order was appealed; (4) five years was taken in appeals; (5) after\r\n  the appeal, the case was transferred from the Attorney General's office to\r\n  Assistant Solicitor Pascoe; and (6) Pascoe was elected as Solicitor of another\r\n  circuit.Â  Judge Lockemy also discussed the prejudice to Evans involving\r\n  witnesses and evidence.Â  He noted that Tillman &quot;may have said [something]\r\n  from someone else,&quot; which &quot;may or may not be admissible&quot; and\r\n  Ballard did not know if she was &quot;dead or alive.&quot;Â  He also stated that\r\n  as to the evidence, no one had &quot;introduced to me yet anything . . . that\r\n  is going to be prejudicial specifically to the defendant.&quot;Â  He also\r\n  clarified that his ruling did not include the indictments served in 2005, and he\r\n  requested that another hearing be set up to address those indictments.\r\nEvans filed a\r\n  motion to reconsider Judge Lockemy's denial of her motion for speedy trial on\r\n  April 8, 2005.Â  Judge Lockemy heard the motion to reconsider on October 16,\r\n  2006.Â  At the October 16, 2006 hearing, Ballard asserted it had been twelve\r\n  years and seven months from the date of the offense; however, he stated that it\r\n  &quot;is probably the correct manner&quot; to &quot;deduct from that period of\r\n  time the entire period of time on which this case was on appeal.&quot;Â  Ballard\r\n  also admitted that Hodge's conflict in 1994 due to his election as Solicitor\r\n  was justified.Â  Judge Lockemy again considered the Barker factors.Â  As\r\n  to the length of delay in bringing the case to trial, Judge Lockemy noted that\r\n  &quot;a lot of [the delay] has been due to matters that are going on just as\r\n  the inherent problem when you have a solicitor's office who cannot prosecute\r\n  something and you have to go from place to place . . . .&quot;Â  See Waites,\r\n  270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653 (holding that the &quot;constitutional\r\n  guarantee of a speedy trial is protection only against delay which is arbitrary\r\n  or unreasonable&quot;).Â  In consideration of the fourth and most important\r\n  factor, prejudice, Judge Lockemy found Evans &quot;has not met certain\r\n  prejudices as stated in the [Barker] case and restated in the standard\r\n  there by incarceration, she's not been incarcerated.&quot;Â  He further stated,\r\n  &quot;[t]here has been no real strong assertion that there has been a strong\r\n  prejudice.&quot;Â  See Brazell, 325 S.C. at 76, 480 S.E.2d at\r\n  70-71 (noting the three-year and five-month delay was negated by the lack of\r\n  prejudice to the defense).Â  \r\nDuring the\r\n  December 11, 2006 trial, Evans again asked Judge Lockemy to reconsider his\r\n  denial of her motion for speedy trial.Â  After hearing Evans' argument and\r\n  testimony from Tillman's granddaughter, Debra Lewis, that Tillman had been\r\n  diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2003, Judge Lockemy again denied the motion.Â \r\n  Judge Lockemy stated he made his decision to deny her motion after\r\n  &quot;consideration of the entire record, a totality of all the circumstances,\r\n  the consideration of any prejudice regarding the death of Mr. Allen, the\r\n  incompetency to testify of Mrs. Tillman, the unavailability of Mr. Wilson\r\n  apparently.&quot;Â  Therefore, we find Judge Lockemy's denial of Evans' 1998\r\n  motion to dismiss based on a violation of her right to a speedy trial was\r\n  supported by the evidence.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Judge Floyd did not rule on Evans' motion for speedy\r\n  trial.\r\n[2]Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3] Â We note the twelve-year delay in bringing Evans' case\r\n  to trial is troubling; however, in this case, we find it was justifiable.\r\n[4]Â  At the October 16, 2006 hearing, Judge Lockemy informed\r\n  Ballard he could only decide Evans' motion for speedy trial as it related to\r\n  the indictments for murder because the indictments for involuntary manslaughter\r\n  and homicide by child abuse were served on her during the October 2006\r\n  hearing.Â  Ballard responded, &quot;[P]erhaps I will of necessity have to\r\n  revisit that issue as a delay in indictment case and due process violation\r\n  rather than a speedy trial.&quot;Â  Evans then filed a subsequent motion based\r\n  on the later-filed indictments on December 11, 2006.Â  This motion was not based\r\n  on a speedy trial violation, but stated the delay of more than twelve years in\r\n  issuing the indictments violated Evans' constitutional due process rights.Â  At\r\n  the December 11, 2006 trial, Ballard told the court that the motion he filed\r\n  that day did not pertain to the murder indictments because he did not\r\n  &quot;think it would be appropriate for [him] to argue that there was a delay\r\n  in the murder indictments, because they were issued in 1994.Â  That was a long\r\n  time ago.&quot;Â  Therefore, we do not address the December 11, 2006 motion\r\n  based on the later-filed indictments.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4642","title":"SCDSS v.

Magera, S.C. Department of Social Services, of North\r\n          Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In this child support action, Eric Johnson\r\n  (Johnson) argues he was not properly notified of the registration of his\r\n  foreign child support order and was\r\n  improperly found in contempt for violation of the child support order.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 20, 1998, Johnson\r\n  was personally served with a summons and complaint concerning a child support\r\n  matter from the North Carolina Department of Social Services (NCDSS) on behalf\r\n  of Natlynn Jimmerson, the mother of Johnson's biological child.Â  At the time,\r\n  Johnson resided in North Carolina.Â  NCDSS mailed the notice for the child\r\n  support hearing to Johnson's last known address.Â  A hearing to establish child\r\n  support was held on June 5, 1998, but Johnson failed to appear.Â  An\r\n  order for child support in the amount of $421 per month was then entered\r\n  against him on July 17, 1998.Â  The order also required Johnson to keep NCDSS\r\n  &quot;informed of his current residence and mailing address.&quot;Â  Johnson did\r\n  not make the full monthly child support payments, although portions of his\r\n  wages were withheld and applied towards his obligations.Â  \r\nJohnson later moved to South\r\n  Carolina.Â  NCDSS requested verification of his last known address from the\r\n  United States Postal Service in January 2005.Â  The United States Postal Service\r\n  verified Johnson's address as 7986 Shadow Oak Drive, North Charleston, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  On February 28, 2005, NCDSS sent the case to the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Social Services (SCDSS), seeking enforcement of the order and\r\n  $19,085.68 in arrears. Â The child support order was subsequently filed and\r\n  registered in South Carolina on January 3, 2007.[1]Â \r\n  On May 3, 2007, notice of the registration was sent to Johnson at his last\r\n  known address on Shadow Oak Drive in North Charleston, South Carolina.Â  \r\nJohnson's arrearages\r\n  continued to increase due to his failure to obey the 2007 child support order,\r\n  and by July 2007, $32,859.41 in arrears had accumulated.Â  The clerk of court\r\n  issued a rule to show cause ordering Johnson to appear before the family court\r\n  in September 2007 and show cause why he should not be found in contempt of\r\n  court for failing to pay child support.Â  The rule to show cause was sent by\r\n  first-class mail to Johnson's Shadow Oak Drive address.Â  \r\nJohnson did not appear at the\r\n  September 2007 hearing.Â  The family court issued a bench warrant for failure to\r\n  pay child support, and Johnson was arrested.Â  At the contempt hearing, Johnson\r\n  admitted he knew about both of his child support cases and acknowledged that\r\n  although he was currently employed, he had failed to pay the requisite child\r\n  support payments.Â  Johnson was then found to be in civil contempt for failure\r\n  to pay his child support as ordered.Â  Johnson was sentenced to one year\r\n  imprisonment, with the ability to purge the confinement upon the payment of\r\n  $150 in court fees and $34,627.61 in arrearages. \r\nJohnson filed a motion to\r\n  reconsider, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nOn appeal, Johnson sets forth\r\n  two main arguments:\r\n1. The family court erred in finding\r\n  Johnson received proper notice of the registration of the child support order.\r\n2. The family court erred in finding\r\n  Johnson in contempt for violation of the child support order because the\r\n  procedure by which Johnson was found in contempt violated the requirements of\r\n  fundamental due process.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In appeals from the\r\n  family court, an appellate court has the authority to find the facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Carpenter\r\n    v. Burr, 381 S.C. 494, 501, 673 S.E.2d 818, 822 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  However,\r\n  this broad scope of review does not require this court to disregard the family\r\n  courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149-50\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Mazloom v.\r\n    Mazloom, 382 S.C. 307, 317, 675 S.E.2d 746, 751 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Notice of\r\n  Registration\r\nJohnson argues he did not\r\n  receive proper notice of the registration of the foreign support order, and\r\n  this lack of notice divested the family court of jurisdiction to enforce the\r\n  order.Â  We disagree.\r\nA. Section 20-7-1140(A) &amp;\r\n  UIFSA\r\nJohnson first contends SCDSS\r\n  failed to comply with section 20-7-1140(A)[2] of the South Carolina Code as well as the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act\r\n  (UIFSA) when it registered the foreign support order.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the time notice was sent\r\n  to Johnson in May 2007, the South Carolina statute controlling registration and\r\n  notice of a foreign support order read: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    registering tribunal shall notify the nonregistering party of the registration\r\n    of a support order or income withholding order issued in another state.Â  Notice\r\n      must be given by first-class, certified, or registered mail or by any means or\r\n      personal service authorized by the law of this State.Â  The notice must be\r\n    accompanied by a copy of the registered order and the documents and relevant\r\n    information accompanying the order.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1140(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added).\r\nThe notice of filing and the\r\n  certificate of mailing for the registration order indicate SCDSS complied with\r\n  these statutory requirements.Â  The notice of filing directing SCDSS to notify\r\n  Johnson stated, &quot;The Child Support Enforcement Legal Division shall send\r\n  by first class mail to the obligor at the address given above a Notice\r\n  of Registration with a copy of the registered support order.&quot; (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Furthermore, the certificate of mailing verified a Child Support\r\n  Specialist for SCDSS &quot;mailed in a sealed envelope, postage prepaid, a copy\r\n  of the Notice of Filing of Registration&quot; to Johnson at his Shadow Oak\r\n  Drive address.Â  Although Johnson argues there is no evidence in the record to\r\n  indicate the Notice of Registration was sent by first-class mail, the\r\n  certificate of mailing reflects otherwise.Â  \r\nJohnson additionally argues\r\n  even though NCDSS verified his address in 2005, the notification of the child\r\n  support registration was not sent by SCDSS to his Shadow Oak address until\r\n  2007.Â  He contends that he was no longer living at this address when the\r\n  notification was mailed; thus, it is inherently unfair to allow SCDSS's\r\n  two-year delay in notifying him to work to his detriment.Â  \r\nDespite Johnson's contention,\r\n  the North Carolina child support order at issue explicitly stated that Johnson\r\n  was required to keep NCDSS informed of his current residence and mailing\r\n  address.Â  Johnson failed to establish at the contempt hearing or the Rule 59(e)\r\n  hearing that he ever updated his address with NCDSS as required by both court\r\n  order and state statute.[3]Â \r\n  Furthermore, Johnson was already statutorily required to notify SCDSS of any\r\n  change in his address for purposes of another child support order that was\r\n  registered against him in May 2003.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code section\r\n  20-7-854 (Supp. 2007) (currently Â§ 63-17-450 (Supp. 2008)) sets forth which\r\n  information an obligor is required to maintain with SCDSS for child support\r\n  purposes.Â  Among other information, the obligor must provide his or her residence\r\n  and mailing address and must notify SCDSS of any changes to this information\r\n  within ten days of the effective date of change.Â  Â§ 20-7-854(A)(1), (2).Â  \r\nDespite his responsibility to\r\n  update this information, Johnson never notified SCDSS of any changes in his\r\n  address as he was statutorily required to do by virtue of the 2003 child\r\n  support order.Â  Further, Johnson openly acknowledged at his contempt hearing\r\n  that he was aware of and was in arrearages on both the 2003 and 2007 child\r\n  support obligations.Â  Notwithstanding his acknowledgment of the two child\r\n  support cases, Johnson failed to properly notify either SCDSS or NCDSS of his\r\n  change in address.\r\nJohnson's claim regarding\r\n  UIFSA is also without merit.Â  Section 605 of UIFSA, entitled &quot;Notice of\r\n  Registration of Order,&quot; states that a &quot;registering tribunal shall\r\n  notify the nonregistering party&quot; when a support order is registered in\r\n  another state.Â  Unif. Interstate Family Support Act Â§ 605(a) (2001).Â  Johnson\r\n  argues that the mailing of the registration failed to comport with the\r\n  requirements of section 605 because he did not receive actual notice of the\r\n  filing.Â  However, our statute, not UIFSA, is controlling on the manner of\r\n  notification.Â  See Unif. Interstate Family Support Act Â§ 305 cmt. (2001)\r\n  (&quot;[UIFSA] also directs that the individual or entity requesting the filing\r\n  be notified, but leaves the means of that notification to local law.&quot;);\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1035 (Supp. 2007) (currently Â§ 63-17-3230 (Supp. 2008))\r\n  (&quot;Except as otherwise provided in this article, a responding tribunal of\r\n  this State shall . . . apply the procedural and substantive law generally\r\n  applicable to similar proceedings originating in this State . . .&quot;).Â  \r\nFurther, nothing in the plain\r\n  language of section 605 or in the official comments mandates that the\r\n  registering tribunal provide actual notice of the registration to the\r\n  obligor.Â  Rather, the comments indicate that because of a variety of\r\n  notification methods, such as telephone facsimile or electronic mail, the\r\n  method of notifying a nonregistering party should be governed by local law.Â  See Unif. Interstate Family Support Act Â§ 305 cmt. (2001).Â  As such, the mailing of\r\n  the Notice of Registration to his last known address by first-class mail was\r\n  sufficient to notify Johnson of the child support order.\r\nB. South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure\r\nJohnson avers section\r\n  20-7-1140(A) allows for personal service of the Notice of Registration, which proves\r\n  the Legislature intended the Notice of Registration to be personally served in\r\n  compliance with Rule 4 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nRule 4(d)(1), SCRCP, governs\r\n  service of a summons and complaint upon a defendant and mandates service upon\r\n  an individual &quot;by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to him\r\n  personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house or usual place of\r\n  abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or\r\n  by delivering a copy to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive\r\n  service of process.&quot;Â  Indeed, Rule 4 mandates personal service of a\r\n  summons and complaint when an action at law is instituted.Â  However, Johnson's\r\n  argument overlooks that the notice of registration for an existing child\r\n  support order is separate and distinct from the service of a summons and\r\n  complaint.Â  Johnson was already personally served with a summons and complaint\r\n  in 1998 when the mother instituted this child support action; therefore, Rule\r\n  4, SCRCP, is inapplicable in this context. \r\nFor purposes of section\r\n  20-7-1140(A), Rule 5 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure governs how\r\n  the Notice of Registration should be served.Â  Rule 5 states that all\r\n  &quot;pleadings subsequent to the original summons and complaint&quot; and\r\n  &quot;written notices&quot; must be served upon a party by &quot;delivering a\r\n  copy to [the party] or by mailing it to [the party] at his last known\r\n  address.&quot;Â  Rule 5, SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  While both section\r\n  20-7-1140(A) and Rule 5 permit personal service of a written notice upon a\r\n  party, the Legislature's choice of the term &quot;or&quot; illustrates its\r\n  intent to grant the registering tribunal the option of how to effectuate\r\n  service.Â  See SCDSS v. Lisa C., 380 S.C. 406, 414, 669 S.E.2d\r\n  647, 651 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;If a statute's language is plain, unambiguous,\r\n  and conveys a clear and definite meaning, rules of statutory interpretation are\r\n  not necessary, and the court has no right to look for or impose another\r\n  meaning.&quot;).Â  As a result, SCDSS's decision to mail the Notice of\r\n  Registration to Johnson's last known address comported with the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\n2. Civil\r\n  Contempt\r\nJohnson claims the family\r\n  court erred in finding him in contempt for violation of the child support order\r\n  because the procedure by which he was found in contempt violated the\r\n  requirements of fundamental due process. Â We disagree.\r\nContempt results\r\n  from the willful disobedience of a court order. Moseley v. Mosier, 279\r\n  S.C. 348, 351, 306 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1983). Â Before a court may find a person in\r\n  contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous\r\n  conduct. Â Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918\r\n  (1982). Â Once a moving party makes out a prima facie case of contempt by\r\n  pleading the order and showing its noncompliance, the burden shifts to the\r\n  respondent to establish his defense and inability to comply. Â Means v. Means,\r\n  277 S.C. 428, 430, 288 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1982). Â A finding of contempt rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Â Haselwood v. Sullivan,\r\n  283 S.C. 29, 32, 320 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nPrior to the family court\r\n  finding Johnson in contempt, the clerk of court issued a rule to show cause,\r\n  requiring Johnson to appear in court for his failure to pay child support.Â  The\r\n  rule to show cause contained an affidavit and properly identified the parties\r\n  to the action, the child support order at issue, and the amount of arrearages\r\n  that had accumulated as of that date.Â  Subsequently, the family court ordered\r\n  that a bench warrant be issued for Johnson's refusal to obey the court's order\r\n  to pay child support pursuant to South Carolina Code section 20-7-870 (Supp.\r\n  2007) (currently Â§ 63-17-390 (Supp. 2008)).Â  Johnson was arrested and then\r\n  brought before the family court, at which time the family court conducted a\r\n  hearing and found he had the ability to pay child support, but failed to do\r\n  so.Â  As a result, the family court found Johnson in civil contempt and\r\n  sentenced him to one year in jail with the ability to purge his confinement by\r\n  payment of the arrearages and $150 in court costs.Â  \r\nThe Code contemplates an\r\n  instance in which an alleged contemnor can be imprisoned for failure to obey a\r\n  support order.Â  In this situation, section 20-7-870 permits the family court to\r\n  issue a bench warrant to hale an alleged contemnor into court without prior\r\n  notice.Â  Section 20-7-870 states, &quot;Where a respondent shall neglect or\r\n  refuse to obey an order for support or upon agreement signed by the respondent\r\n  and approved by the court, and the court is satisfied thereof by competent\r\n  proof, it may, with or without notice, issue a warrant to commit the\r\n  respondent to jail until the order is obeyed or until the respondent is\r\n  discharged by law.&quot; (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWhile this court is not\r\n  bound by the opinions of the Attorney General, we find it instructive to\r\n  reference an opinion specifically discussing section 20-7-870[4] and its application in an indirect contempt proceeding.Â  See Price v.\r\n    Watt, 280 S.C. 510, 513 n.1, 313 S.E.2d 58, 60 n.1 (Ct. App. 1984) (&quot;While\r\n  this Court is not bound by an opinion of our Attorney General, it should not be\r\n  disregarded without cogent reason.&quot;).Â  Noting the Code was silent on the\r\n  issue of proper service of a rule to show cause for contempt, the Attorney\r\n  General opined:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    Court must be presented with proof that the party was personally served before\r\n    it may issue a bench warrant which is based solely on respondent's failure to\r\n    appear. When presented with satisfactory proof of personal service, the Court\r\n    may, in its discretion, issue a warrant for the arrest of a person who fails to\r\n    respond to a rule to show cause.Â  \r\n\r\nSee Op. S.C. Att'y Gen., 1979 WL 29077, at *2 (June 5,\r\n  1979).Â  \r\nIf, however, an alleged\r\n  contemnor is not personally served with the rule to show cause, the\r\n  family court may, pursuant to the provisions of section 20-7-870, use the\r\n  scheduled court time to conduct a hearing to determine whether there is\r\n  &quot;competent proof&quot; of disobedience of the court order.Â  Id.Â  If\r\n  there is such proof, the family court may issue a warrant for the contemnor's\r\n  arrest, which would be based on section 20-7-870, rather than the failure to\r\n  respond to the rule to show cause.Â  Id.\r\nThe record must demonstrate\r\n  that there was competent proof of Johnson's failure to obey the order of\r\n  support.Â  Here, the record clearly reflects Johnson failed to comply with the\r\n  prior support order, of which he was properly notified.Â  The clerk of court's\r\n  records, along with Johnson's admission of noncompliance despite his ability to\r\n  pay, provide clear and convincing evidence of noncompliance.Â  See Durlach\r\n    v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 71, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (&quot;Civil\r\n  contempt must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;).Â  In light of\r\n  section 20-7-870 and Johnson's disobedience of the prior support order, the\r\n  family court's issuance of a bench warrant and decision to sentence Johnson to\r\n  one year in jail with the ability to purge his confinement by payment of the\r\n  arrearages was not in error. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThus, the family court's\r\n  decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The 2007 order was the second child support order\r\n  registered against Johnson in South Carolina.Â  The first order was issued in\r\n  North Carolina in 1996 and registered in South Carolina in 2003.Â  Johnson was also\r\n  held in contempt for failure to pay $26,786.57 in child support pursuant to the\r\n  2003 order; however, Johnson does not contest the court's contempt finding for\r\n  that order in this appeal.\r\n[2] In support of his argument, Johnson references\r\n  provisions from Title 20, Chapter 7, which govern paternity and child support.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-952 to -1166 (Supp. 2007).Â  These code\r\n  sections are now designated as Chapter 17 in Title 63 due to the Legislature's\r\n  restructuring of the Children's Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 63-17-10 to\r\n  -4040 (Supp. 2008).Â  Because this case arose prior to the recodification, the\r\n  former statutory citations are referenced when applicable.\r\n[3] N.C. Code Ann. Section 50-13.9(c) (Supp. 2008)\r\n  states, &quot;In an IV-D case, the parties affected by the order shall inform\r\n  the designated child support enforcement agency of any change of address or\r\n  other condition that may affect the administration of the order.Â  The court may\r\n  provide in the order that a party failing to inform the court or, as\r\n  appropriate, the designated child support enforcement agency, of a change of\r\n  address within a reasonable period of time may be held in civil contempt.&quot;\r\n  (notification language in effect when original child support order registered\r\n  in 1998). Â \r\n[4] Â The Attorney General's opinion references S.C. Code\r\n  section 14-21-70 (1976), which was repealed in 1981 and recodified as section 20-7-870.Â \r\n  Section 20-7-870 is now designated as section 63-17-890 pursuant to the\r\n  Legislature's restructuring of the Children's Code in 2008. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4643","title":"Wendy McDaniel v.

Keesley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4643\r\n  Heard October 6, 2009 â€“ Filed December 31,\r\n2009Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Patrick John Frawley, of Lexington, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        James Poag, Jr., of West Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:Â  Carolyn\r\n  Kendrick appeals the trial court's finding she failed to establish the\r\n  requisite elements of adverse possession or a constructive trust.Â  We affirm.\r\nPROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND/FACTS\r\nRobert Kendrick and Carolyn\r\n  married in 1986, and each party brought children from their former marriages\r\n  into the family.Â  Prior to the marriage, Robert owned a five-acre parcel of\r\n  land in Lexington County (the property) titled solely in his name.[1]Â  Carolyn purchased a double-wide trailer to place on\r\n  the property and this served as the marital home for the couple and their\r\n  children.Â  Robert and Carolyn made monthly mortgage payments on the property\r\n  from marital funds and eventually satisfied the mortgage on the land with proceeds\r\n  from the sale of Carolyn's previous home. \r\nIn the fall of 1988, Robert\r\n  and Carolyn separated.Â  Robert and his children moved out of the marital\r\n  residence and into a home in West Columbia.Â  His daughter, Wendy, a junior at\r\n  Pelion High School, was informed she could no longer participate in sports or\r\n  attend school there because of her relocation.Â  In response, Robert deeded the\r\n  property to Wendy in 1989 for five dollars, love, and affection. Â Wendy\r\n  continued at Pelion High School and graduated in 1990. \r\nIn 1990, after a\r\n  heart-related health scare, Robert created a document that appears to have\r\n  testamentary intent but does not meet the formalities required to create a\r\n  will.[2]Â \r\n  The document states:\r\n\r\n  On the\r\n    26th day of November, 1990, as I make these request [sic] of the persons I love\r\n    to be carried out upon my death, I am of sound mind and fully capable of making\r\n    these decisions.\r\n  Concerning\r\n    a parcel of land which I owned until January of 1989 and at that time sold the\r\n    land to my daughter, Wendy Sue Kendrick[,] for the sum of $5.00 and love and\r\n    consideration, I want my wife, Carolyn J. Kendrick[,] to be able to live on the\r\n    land in her present dwelling without rent or any monetary consideration for as\r\n    long as she wants to.Â  If she leaves that land to live some place else, she\r\n    will give up all future rights to live there.Â  The land is to remain in Wendy\r\n    Sue Kendrick's name.Â  There is to be no other dwelling, either temporary or\r\n    permanent[,] put on the land.Â  My daughter fully understands this and has\r\n    agreed to abide by my wishes.\r\n\r\nRobert and Carolyn continued\r\n  to live separate and apart but remained married and involved in each other's\r\n  lives.Â  Around 2002, Robert developed Alzheimer's disease and his sister began\r\n  managing his affairs and caring for him.Â  In March 2005, Wendy, who had little\r\n  to no contact with Carolyn through the years, requested Carolyn vacate the\r\n  property or buy it from her.Â Â Â  Carolyn refused and filed a divorce action\r\n  apparently seeking to assert a claim to the property through the apportionment\r\n  of marital assets.Â  However, Carolyn abandoned that action when Wendy filed a\r\n  suit in circuit court and asserted her interest through counterclaims.Â  Wendy's\r\n  complaint sought to remove Carolyn from the property or in the alternative\r\n  requested reasonable rental payments.Â  Carolyn answered and alleged ownership\r\n  in the property by adverse possession and constructive trust.Â  She further\r\n  requested the value of improvements to the property in the event she was\r\n  required to vacate.[3]\r\nThe trial court ruled Carolyn\r\n  failed to prove adverse possession of the property because she had not\r\n  demonstrated the required element of hostility.Â  The trial court further found Carolyn\r\n  did not establish a constructive trust because she presented no evidence of\r\n  fraud.Â  Additionally, Carolyn's request for the value of improvements to the\r\n  property was denied. Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn adverse\r\n  possession claim is an action at law.Â  Miller v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56,\r\n  61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1992).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, this\r\n  court will not disturb the trial court's findings unless they are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the record or controlled by an error of law.Â  Coakley v.\r\n    Horace Mann Ins. Co., 376 S.C. 2, 6, 656 S.E.2d 17, 19 (2007).Â  An action\r\n  to declare a constructive trust is an action in equity.Â  Macauley v.\r\n    Wachovia Bank of S.C., 351 S.C. 287, 294, 569 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  In actions at equity, the appellate court may find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the evidence.Â  Id. at 294, 569 S.E.2d at 375.Â  When\r\n  legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own\r\n  identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of\r\n  review on appeal.Â  Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 17-18, 640 S.E.2d 486,\r\n  495 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Adverse\r\n  Possession\r\nCarolyn contends\r\n  the trial court erred in finding she was required to establish the element of\r\n  hostility when claiming adverse possession of an entire tract of land.Â  She\r\n  maintains the trial court further erred in concluding her possession was not\r\n  sufficiently hostile.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to\r\n  establish a claim of adverse possession, the claimant must prove by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence his possession of the subject property was continuous,\r\n  hostile, actual, open, notorious, and exclusive for the statutory period.Â  All\r\n    Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of S.C.,\r\n  358 S.C. 209, 229, 595 S.E.2d 253, 265 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Knox v. Bogan,\r\n  322 S.C. 64, 66, 472 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1996), Knox claimed ownership of property\r\n  designated as the southern tract through adverse possession.Â  An old fence\r\n  separated the southern tract from Bogan's property.Â  Id. at 69, 472\r\n  S.E.2d at 47.Â  Testimony showed the Knox family had occupied the southern tract\r\n  up to the fence line for more than seventy years under the belief the fence\r\n  line was the boundary between their land and Bogan's.Â  Id. at 69, 472\r\n  S.E.2d at 46-47.Â  The supreme court, addressing the requirement of hostility,\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  The only issue is whether the Knoxes' possession was sufficiently\r\n    hostile. Â As we read Perry v. Heirs at Law and Wigfall v. Fobbs, either\r\n    there is no longer a hostility requirement where the claim is to an entire\r\n    tract, or South Carolina does in fact follow the majority view that the mental\r\n    attitude of the possessor of land is immaterial. Â Under the majority view an\r\n    actual, exclusive, open and notorious possession without the consent of\r\n    the title owner is both wrongful and adverse and will ripen into perfect title\r\n    in the usual way when the statute of limitations has run. Â The majority view\r\n    represents the most practical approach to the hostility requirement of adverse\r\n    possession and is in keeping with the national trend of authority. \r\n\r\nId. at 70-71, 472 S.E.2d at 47 (emphasis\r\n  added) (citations omitted).\r\nThe supreme court did not, as Carolyn argues, eliminate the\r\n  hostility requirement when a party claims adverse possession of an entire tract\r\n  of land.Â  The court simply explained the hostility requirement is not\r\n  necessarily predicated upon the claimant's conscious intention to possess the\r\n  property against the true owner's wishes.Â  A claimant may establish adverse\r\n  possession if he occupies the property under the mistaken belief that it\r\n  belongs to him.Â  In any case, Knox makes clear the claimant must be on\r\n  the property without the consent of the title owner.Â  \r\nTurning to the case before us, Carolyn testified &quot;my\r\n  understanding was that it was my home and there was nothing that I needed to\r\n  do.&quot;Â  When asked why she did not seek Wendy's permission to cut down some\r\n  trees on the property she responded, &quot;I didn't consider her the owner or\r\n  the actual occupant of [the property].Â  I wouldn't have thought to ask\r\n  her.&quot;Â  This testimony suggests Carolyn believed she had some right of\r\n  ownership in the property.Â Â  However, she also testified she knew the property\r\n  was titled solely in Robert's name when they married and was titled solely in\r\n  Wendy's name upon the conveyance in 1989.Â  Furthermore, Carolyn testified she\r\n  never paid taxes on the property, although she did pay taxes on the mobile\r\n  home.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Wendy testified she did not really object to allowing\r\n  Carolyn to live on the property while Robert was alive although she never gave\r\n  Carolyn express permission to stay there.Â  Moreover, Wendy was aware of\r\n  Carolyn's presence on the property from the time of the conveyance and did not\r\n  request Carolyn vacate the premises until March of 2005.Â  \r\nAt best, the\r\n  evidence conflicts as to any mistaken belief Carolyn may have had that the\r\n  property belonged to her.Â  The record contains ample evidence to support\r\n  finding Wendy gave her tacit permission for Carolyn to occupy the property at\r\n  least until October of 2005.Â  We agree with the trial court such evidence does\r\n  not satisfy the requirement of hostility by clear and convincing evidence.\r\nInstead, this\r\n  case is more analogous to those wherein a party entered land with permission of\r\n  the owner and then claimed adverse possession at a later point.Â  See Davis\r\n    v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, 180, 345 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1986) (finding\r\n  occupation of property with owner's tacit permission was not hostile although\r\n  such possession may have become hostile when claimant remained on property\r\n  after being told to vacate); Frady v. Ivester, 118 S.C. 195, 205, 110\r\n  S.E. 135, 138 (1921) (&quot;The defendant's entry into possession was\r\n  permissive, and, as she had a duty to perform, she could not hold adversely to\r\n  the rights of the mortgagors until she either surrendered the possession or\r\n  gave notice of an adverse possession.&quot;); Young v. Nix, 286 S.C.\r\n  134, 136, 332 S.E.2d 773, 774 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding claimant who had farmed\r\n  tract of land for more than forty years with permission of property owner's\r\n  widower did not establish claim of adverse possession without a &quot;clear and\r\n  positive disclaimer of the title under which entry was made&quot;).Â  While a\r\n  party cannot adversely possess property used with permission, a party may begin\r\n  to satisfy the requirement of hostility upon a clear disclaimer of the owner's\r\n  title.Â  All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, 358 S.C. at 233, 595 S.E.2d at 266-67.\r\nIn this case,\r\n  Carolyn entered the property with Robert's permission and remained there for\r\n  the next nineteen years with Wendy's tacit permission.Â  Not until 2005 did\r\n  Wendy request Carolyn vacate or purchase the property.Â  Carolyn's refusal at\r\n  that time may have made her subsequent occupation hostile.Â  However, Carolyn\r\n  clearly had not satisfied the statutory period for adverse possession when\r\n  Wendy commenced her lawsuit just a few months later.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court did not err in finding Carolyn was required to establish the element of\r\n  hostility and that she failed to do so by clear and convincing evidence.\r\nII. Constructive\r\n  Trust\r\nCarolyn argues\r\n  the trial court erred in finding she failed to establish the required element\r\n  of fraud to prove her entitlement to a constructive trust.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law may\r\n  impose a constructive trust when a party obtains a benefit that &quot;does not\r\n  equitably belong to him and which he cannot in good conscience retain or\r\n  withhold from another who is beneficially entitled to it.&quot;Â  SSI Med.\r\n    Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793-94 (1990).Â \r\n  &quot;A constructive trust results from fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence,\r\n  or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to\r\n  make restitution. Â Fraud is an essential element, although it need not be\r\n  actual fraud.&quot;Â  Dye v. Gainey, 320 S.C. 65, 68, 463 S.E.2d 97, 99\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (citing Lollis v. Lollis, 291 S.C. 525, 529, 354 S.E.2d\r\n  559, 561 (1987)). Â The evidence necessary to support the imposition of a\r\n  constructive trust must be clear and convincing.Â  SSI Med. Servs., Inc.,\r\n  301 S.C. at 500, 392 S.E.2d at 794.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  found Carolyn presented no clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate the\r\n  transfer from Robert to Wendy was fraudulent.Â  Carolyn seems to base her fraud\r\n  argument on the belief she acquired an interest in the property because it\r\n  served as the marital home for a period of time and she made monetary\r\n  contributions toward its purchase.Â  Carolyn's contention invites us to consider\r\n  whether she gained an interest in the property through transmutation or some\r\n  equitable means during the parties' marriage.Â  However, she abandoned her divorce action in which any\r\n  transmutation or special equity issues could have been directly determined.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-610 (Supp. 2008) (special equity or ownership rights in\r\n  property are subject to apportionment between spouses by the family courts of\r\n  this State upon the commencement of marital litigation).Â  Therefore, we will not address those issues in the\r\n  case presented on appeal.Â  \r\nThe record\r\n  reveals no other evidence the transfer from Robert to Wendy was fraudulent.Â  Although\r\n  Carolyn is left in an unfortunate position, we cannot conclude she established\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence the imposition of a constructive trust was\r\n  warranted.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find\r\n  Carolyn failed to meet the burdens of proof required to establish adverse\r\n  possession or entitlement to a constructive trust, the ruling of the trial\r\n  court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Robert gained\r\n  sole title to the property by paying his first wife $2,500 to buy her interest\r\n  in the property as part of their divorce settlement.Â  Robert and his first wife\r\n  had purchased the land in 1979.\r\n[2] The parties do\r\n  not appeal the admissibility of this document into evidence.\r\n[3]Â  Robert died in\r\n  January 2007, prior to the trial of this case.\r\n[4] A constructive trust may also be established based on\r\n  the violation of a fiduciary duty.Â  See Chapman v. Citizens &amp;\r\n    So. Nat'l Bank of S.C., 302 S.C. 469, 478-79, 395 S.E.2d 446,\r\n  452 (Ct. App. 1990) (finding a constructive trust in favor of C when A makes a\r\n  will leaving property to B in reliance on B's promise to hold the property for\r\n  C's benefit).Â  According to his 1990 letter, Robert wished for Carolyn to live\r\n  on the property.Â  However, the record contains no clear and convincing evidence\r\n  to demonstrate Robert's conveyance was made in reliance on representations by\r\n  Wendy to hold the property for Carolyn's benefit.Â  The 1990 letter and the fee\r\n  simple conveyance were not contemporaneous.Â  Any wishes Robert expressed or\r\n  agreement he believed Wendy made after the transfer do not directly bear on his\r\n  reliance because the transfer had already been made.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
