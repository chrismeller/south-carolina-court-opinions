Barber, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4023\r\nHeard June 7, 2005 â€“ Filed September 12, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMark D. Cauthen and R. Daniel Addison, both of Columbia, and David A. Wilson and Michael Allen Farry, both of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\nFranklin D. Beattie, Jr., of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:Â  This is a workersâ€™ compensation case involving an award based on change of condition.Â  The Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission found that Joseph Mark Clark, Sr. sustained a change of physical condition resulting in permanent and total disability, and the circuit court affirmed.Â  We affirm as well. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties stipulated that Clark sustained an injury on July 12, 1999 in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Aiken County.Â  Clark twisted his lower back while attempting to unhook a trailer from a vehicle.Â  The parties also stipulated to an average weekly wage and compensation rate.Â Â Â  \r\nIn the original proceeding, the single commissioner found Clark reached MMI on January 20, 2000 and that he had sustained a 30% permanent partial disability as a result of the accident. He awarded benefits accordingly. Â Clark then appealed to the full commission. In his brief to the full commission, he requested, inter alia, that Dr. Martin Greenberg be designated his treating physician â€œto provide alternative medical treatment.â€Â  \r\nWhile the case was pending before the full commission, Clarkâ€™s pain increased. Clark was seen by Dr. John Downey who, along with Clarkâ€™s attorney, referred him to Dr. Greenberg.Â  Dr. Greenberg recommended surgery to Clarkâ€™s back and performed the surgery on July 27, 2001. Clark did not get permission from the County for Dr. Greenberg to treat him or perform the surgery.\r\nOn August 10, 2001 the County tendered and Clark in turn accepted payment of the monetary benefits awarded by the single commissioner.\r\nOn October 9, 2001, the full commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s order, adopting verbatim his findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  The full commission did not address the issue of whether Clarkâ€™s condition had changed since he reached MMI, nor did the full commission address the request in Clarkâ€™s brief that Greenberg be appointed his treating physician.Â  \r\nThe surgery successfully alleviated Clarkâ€™s pain for about four to six months.Â  Then the pain returned, although it was not as severe.Â  After examining Clark again, Dr. Greenberg determined that Clark was permanently vocationally disabled.Â  Clark has not worked since March of 2000 when the County retired him based on disability.\r\nIn January 2002, Clark filed a Form 50 claiming a substantial change of condition.Â  The single commissioner concluded that Clark sustained a worsening of his condition and had an impairment of more than 51% to his back.Â  The single commissioner further concluded that the change in physical condition occurred after August 14, 2001.Â  Accordingly, he awarded Clark benefits for total and permanent disability.Â  The single commissioner also specifically found that the treatment by Dr. Greenberg was â€œnecessary, reasonable and was an attempt to lessen [Clarkâ€™s] disability.â€ He ordered the County to pay for all past and continuing treatment provided to him. \r\nThe County appealed to the full commission, which again affirmed, adopting the findings and conclusions of the single commissioner.Â  The circuit court also affirmed.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act governs judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-310 to 400 (Supp. 2004).Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(6) establishes the substantial evidence rule as the standard of review.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) and (e).Â  \r\nAccordingly, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Stephens v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Instead, review of issues of fact is limited to determining whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 289, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œOn appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports the findings.â€Â  Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.â€Â  Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Change of Condition\r\nThe Countyâ€™s first contention on appeal is that Clark failed to prove a change of condition entitling him to additional compensation.Â  Specifically, the County argues that because the change of condition\r\nasserted by Clark occurred before the full commission issued its order in the initial proceeding, the change could not have occurred subsequent to the first award.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially, Clark argues that the County failed to preserve this argument for appeal.Â  In its request for review by the full commission, the County stated as grounds for appeal, in relevant part, that the single commissioner erred in finding as a fact and concluding as a matter of law that Clark sustained a change of condition for the worse.Â  Clark argues that this assignment of error is not specific enough to preserve the argument for appeal.Â  \r\nAn issue not raised in the application for review is not preserved for the full commissionâ€™s consideration.Â  Creech v. Ducane Co., 320 S.C. 559, 564, 467 S.E.2d 114, 117 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  General exceptions that fail to specifically assign the grounds for error are insufficient to preserve an issue.Â  Bogart v. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., 273 S.C. 179, 180, 255 S.E.2d 449, 450 (1979).Â  However, rules of appellate procedure should not be interpreted to create a trap for the unwary.Â  Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 25, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004).Â  Although we find preservation tenuous at best, we nevertheless proceed to the merits.Â  \r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act provides a mechanism for reopening an award if there has been a change in condition.Â  Creech, 320 S.C. at 564, 467 S.E.2d at 117; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90 (1985).Â  The purpose of this section is to enable the full commission to change the amount of compensation, including increasing compensation when circumstances indicate a change of condition for the worse.Â  Cromer v. Newberry Cotton Mills, 201 S.C. 349, 354-55, 23 S.E.2d 19, 21 (1942).Â  Accordingly, the full commission has continuing jurisdiction over its awards for the period set forth in section 42-17-90.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nUnder section 42-17-90, a change of condition must occur after the first award for a claimant to be eligible for a review of that award.Â  Cromer, 201 S.C. at 357, 23 S.E.2d at 21.Â  â€œThe issue before the Commission is sharply restricted to the question of extent of improvement or worsening of the injury on which the original award was based.â€Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # Â£10420, 353 S.C. 100, 109, 576 S.E.2d 191, 196 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Krell v. S.C. State Hwy. Depâ€™t, 237 S.C. 584, 118 S.E.2d 322 (1961)); 5 Arthur Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation LawÂ  Â§ 131.03 (2004).\r\nThe Countyâ€™s argument appears to resemble a species of claim preclusion, though the County does not refer to it as such.Â  Basically, the County argues that because an award by a single commissioner is not a final adjudication unless neither party appeals to the full commission, the change of condition must occur after review of the initial award by the full commission is completed.Â  See Riddle v. Fairforest Finishing Co., 198 S.C. 419, 424, 18 S.E.2d 341, 343 (1942) (holding that because the single commissionerâ€™s award is not a final adjudication, a party may not appeal directly to the circuit court).Â  In other words, under principles of res judicata, Clark is precluded from asserting a change of condition following the full commissionâ€™s order because he could have asserted it before the full commission in the original claim.Â  \r\nThe doctrine of res judicata ordinarily acts to preclude relitigation of issues or claims actually litigated or which might have been litigated in the first action.Â  Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc.,Â  325 S.C. 532, 540, 482 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Nevertheless, a final judgment or award is not res judicata of issues neither asserted nor required to be asserted â€œor which could not properly be asserted.â€Â  101 C.J.S. Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§ 1499 (2000) (emphasis added).\r\nOur supreme court, citing Restatement (Second) of Judgments, section 20(2) (1982), has held that res judicata is not always an ironclad bar to a later claim:\r\n\r\nA valid and final personal judgment for the defendant, which rests on the prematurity of the action or on the plaintiffâ€™s failure to satisfy a precondition to suit, does not bar another action by the plaintiff instituted after the claim has matured, or after the precondition has been satisfied, unless a second action is precluded by operation of the substantive law.\r\n\r\nLikewise, this court stated in Estridge that a symptom which is â€œpresent and causally connected, but found not to impact upon the claimantâ€™s condition at the time of the original award, may later manifest in full bloom and thereby worsen his or her condition. Such an occurrence is within the reasons for the code section involving a change of condition.â€Â  325 S.C. at 540, 482 S.E.2d at 581.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDr. Greenberg made the determination that Clark needed back surgery to ease his back pain and performed the surgery prior to the full commissionâ€™s order in the initial proceeding.Â  Clark had no way of knowing if the surgery would improve his condition, and, therefore, the degree of change in condition was not yet ripe for review by the full commission.Â  Furthermore, inasmuch as the surgeryâ€™s aim was to lessen Clarkâ€™s degree of disability, the County was not prejudiced by having to wait for the natural and expected improvement of his physical condition following surgery.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Gattis, a claimant sought to introduce evidence not included in the record before the single commissioner.Â  353 S.C. at 105, 576 S.E.2d at 193.Â  The full commission refused to admit the evidence, holding that it would be appropriate for a change of condition proceeding instead. Â Id.Â  The claimant subsequently requested review of the initial award based on change of condition, and the full commission found a change of condition based on the evidence sought to be introduced in the initial proceeding before it.Â  Id. at 106, 576 S.E.2d at 194.Â  The circuit court and this court on appeal affirmed the full commissionâ€™s decision.Â  This court held that because the full commission limited its initial order to a determination of the claimantâ€™s condition prior to the advent of the evidence in question, the evidence was appropriate for the change of condition proceeding.Â  Id. at 109, 576 S.E.2d at 195-96.Â  \r\nFurthermore, it is undisputed that the full commission did not address any change of Clarkâ€™s condition at the time of its decision.Â  The fact that Clark requested in his brief to the full commission that Dr. Greenberg be designated as treating physician, does not lead to the conclusion that the request was actually considered and denied.Â  The full commissionâ€™s order made no ruling on the issue and merely adopted the findings and conclusions of the single commissioner.Â  Because the onset of Clarkâ€™s change of condition began before the full commission made its decision, the County argues that Clark could have moved to admit newly discovered evidence under 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-707 (Supp. 2004).Â  However, because Clark did not know the degree, if any, the surgery would relieve his disability, we conclude his claim should not be barred under the unique facts of this case. \r\nâ€œThe determination of whether a claimant experiences a change of condition is a question for the fact finder.â€Â  Gattis, 353 S.C. at 107, 576 S.E.2d at 194.Â  We must therefore affirm if substantial evidence supports the full commissionâ€™s finding.Â  See Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nUpon his examination of Clark in July 2001, Dr. Greenberg testified that based on MRI results there had been a worsening of his condition since Dr. Epstein saw him in March of 2000.Â  The MRI showed severe progressive narrowing of the spine, a marked worsening of Clarkâ€™s previous condition, leading Dr. Greenberg to recommend urgent surgery.Â  Likewise, Dr. Gero Kragh testified that a comparison of Clarkâ€™s MRIs indicated a change of condition after June of 2000.Â  He opined that the surgery was medically necessary in an effort to lessen Clarkâ€™s disability. Additionally, Clark testified to increased pain in his legs and back after February 2001 and the lessening of that pain after the surgery. He testified also that some of the pain returned several months after the surgery, but not to the extent it persisted before the surgery.Â  Therefore, substantial evidence exists in the record to support the finding that Clark sustained a change of condition subsequent to the prior award.Â  \r\nII. Designation of Dr. Greenberg as Authorized Treating Physician\r\nThe County next argues that because Dr. Greenberg was not Clarkâ€™s designated medical provider at the time he recommended and performed the surgery, the full commission erred in ordering it to pay for the treatment. We disagree.Â  \r\nÂ After Clarkâ€™s back injury, the County referred him to Dr. Gary T. Fishbach, who referred him to Dr. Franklin M. Epstein.Â  Dr. Epstein opined that Clark was not a suitable candidate for surgery because he was obese and smoked.[1]Â  Dr. Epstein therefore referred Clark to Dr. John Downey for pain management in the fall of 2000.Â  \r\nClarkâ€™s pain continued, however, and he sought a second opinion.Â  Clark spoke to his wife, who had worked with Dr. Greenberg.Â  Dr. Downey referred Clark to Dr. Greenberg for an evaluation for surgery, noting that the referral was made at Clarkâ€™s attorneyâ€™s request.Â  Dr. Greenberg testified that Clarkâ€™s wife made the referral along with Dr. Downey.Â  Clark testified he asked Dr. Downey for the referral because of the persistent pain.Â  \r\nDuring that period a conflict arose among the physicians.Â  Drs. Epstein, Downey, and Greenberg were originally in practice together at the Southern Neurologic Institute.Â  The practice split apart in the fall of 2001.Â  Dr. Greenberg left Dr. Epstein and joined Dr. Downey in October of 2001.Â  The breakup resulted in ill will between Dr. Epstein and Dr. Greenberg.Â  In Dr. Greenbergâ€™s affidavit, he testified Clark advised him the treatment he had received from Dr. Epstein was unsatisfactory, and Dr. Epstein refused to provide Dr. Greenberg with Clarkâ€™s records.Â  \r\nAfter Dr. Greenberg performed the surgery and Clark filed a claim for change of condition, the County demanded another evaluation by Dr. Epstein.Â  When Clark refused to attend the appointment, the County filed a motion to compel his participation.Â  Clark moved to disqualify Dr. Epstein, alleging that Dr. Epsteinâ€™s former relationship and contacts with Dr. Greenberg prevented him from performing a fair and impartial medical examination.Â  Dr. Greenberg also provided an affidavit stating that Dr. Epstein had refused to provide him with records.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the single commissioner granted the Countyâ€™s motion to compel and denied Clarkâ€™s motion to disqualify.Â  The single commissioner found no evidence of bias or prejudice on Dr. Epsteinâ€™s part.Â  \r\nClark attended the scheduled evaluation with Dr. Epstein in August 2002.Â  Clarkâ€™s wife and a friend, both nurses, accompanied Clark during the evaluation.Â  They observed that Dr. Epstein failed to perform a complete examination.Â  Dr. Epstein reported the surgery performed by Dr. Greenberg was not medically necessary.Â  \r\nIn response to Dr. Epsteinâ€™s report, Dr. Gero S. Kragh, a medical consultant, also evaluated Clark.Â  Dr. Kragh confirmed the medical necessity of the surgery, although he said that a pharmacological approach should have been tried first.Â  Dr. Kragh called Dr. Epsteinâ€™s report into question and agreed that Clark had suffered a change of condition.\r\nThe single commissioner found the demeanor and testimony of Clark, his wife, and her friend credible and consistent.Â  The single commissioner also drew inferences consistent with the opinions of Dr. Greenberg and Dr. Kragh and considered the conflict with Dr. Epstein and its origin.Â  \r\nThe Workerâ€™s Compensation Act provides that the employer retains the right to name the authorized treating physician once a case has been accepted.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985).Â  Refusal by the claimant to accept treatment generally bars further compensation.Â  Id.Â  However, the full commission, when it deems it necessary, may override the employerâ€™s choice of providers and order a change in the medical or hospital service provided.Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # Â£10420,&nbsp;353 S.C. 100, 114, 576 S.E.2d 191, 198&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  The full commission is further empowered to order payment of medical bills in such cases.Â  Id. at 111, 576 S.E.2d 196-97.Â  \r\nGenerally, a claimant may obtain compensation only by accepting services from the employerâ€™s choice of providers.Â  However, a claimant is not required to sacrifice much-needed treatment merely to comply with an employerâ€™s choice of physicians.Â  See Risinger v. Knight Textiles, 353 S.C. 69, 73, 577 S.E.2d 222, 224-25 (2002) (holding that â€œthe language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 does not allow an employer to dictate the medical treatment of injured employees.â€).Â  The full commission is empowered to order further medical care when controversies arise between a claimant and the employer.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60. \r\nIn Ford v. Allied Chemical Corp., 252 S.C. 561, 564, 167 S.E.2d 564, 565 (1969), a claimant who had seriously injured his neck was put under the care of the company doctor.Â  The company doctor referred the claimant to an orthopedic surgeon who was not impressed with the claimantâ€™s symptoms and discharged him.Â  The claimantâ€™s symptoms continued to worsen, and he contacted a family physician who examined the claimant and concluded he was disabled.Â  Id. at 565, 167 S.E.2d at 566.Â  The supreme court upheld the full commissionâ€™s finding that because the claimant had related his condition to the orthopedic surgeon, and received no assistance, the claimant was justified in refusing further care from that physician and in seeking treatment elsewhere.Â  Id. at 567, 167 S.E.2d at 167.Â  \r\nIn this case, Dr. Epstein indicated Clark was not a suitable candidate for treatment and referred him for pain management.[2]Â  That treatment was unsuccessful, however.Â  Because Clark related the continuing symptoms to the treating physicians and was unable to obtain relief, he was justified in seeking treatment elsewhere.Â  Although the more appropriate procedure would have been for Clark to seek an order from the full commission before engaging Dr. Greenberg for treatment and surgery, we find that under Ford the full commission was not outside its discretion in ordering the County to pay for the surgery and continuing treatment, once it determined the treatment was medically necessary.Â  See Gattis, 353 S.C. at 111, 576 S.E.2d at 197 (holding that the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act is to be liberally construed and reasonable doubts as to construction are to be resolved in favor of coverage).Â  \r\nWe find no merit to the Countyâ€™s argument that the full commission allowed Clark to â€œshop aroundâ€ indefinitely until he found a favorable opinion.Â  In Risinger, the court held this stateâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation statute does not allow an employer to â€œdoctor shopâ€ for a favorable opinion while sacrificing much-needed treatment for the claimant.Â  353 S.C. at 73, 577 S.E.2d at 224.Â  The evidence in the record indicates Clark sought treatment from Greenberg solely for the purpose of obtaining relief from his pain.Â  Furthermore, both Dr. Greenberg and Dr. Kragh testified that Clarkâ€™s condition had worsened after the closing of evidence in the original proceeding.Â  The pain management treatment was insufficient to meet Clarkâ€™s needs.Â  Finally, evidence of bias on the part of Dr. Epstein lends support to the full commissionâ€™s finding that Clark was in need of alternative treatment.Â  We therefore affirm the full commissionâ€™s order in this regard.Â  \r\nIII. Total and Permanent Disability\r\nThe Countyâ€™s final argument is that the full commission erred in determining Clark was totally and permanently disabled.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe full commission found that Clark sustained an impairment of greater than 51% to his back and concluded he was totally and permanently disabled.Â  To qualify for total and permanent disability, a claimant must suffer a 50% or greater loss of use of his back.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(19) (Supp. 2004).Â  The full commissionâ€™s finding as to the degree of impairment is a question of fact.Â  Lyles v. Quantum Chemical Co. (Emery),&nbsp;315 S.C. 440, 445, 434 S.E.2d 292, 294-295&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  Accordingly, we must affirm if the full commissionâ€™s findings are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981).Â  \r\nIn the original proceeding, the full commission rated Clarkâ€™s impairment at 30%.Â  Thus, the question in this change of condition proceeding is whether evidence indicates that since that time, Clarkâ€™s impairment has increased to 50%.Â  \r\nDr. Greenberg testified that Clark is permanently vocationally disabled.Â  He testified that Clarkâ€™s back pain is caused by severe degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis, which has become incapacitating.Â  Clark will need lifelong medication and follow-up treatment.Â  Dr. Kragh rated Clarkâ€™s impairment in the range of 30% whole body, 40% spinal based on cauda equine syndrome, lateral recess syndrome, S-1 radiculopathy, and possibly myelopathy.Â  \r\nClarkâ€™s wife testified that she has been the sole financial provider for the family since July of 1999.Â  Clarkâ€™s physical activity level has grown progressively worse since that time.Â  He sleeps only a few hours at a time.Â  He also requires assistance in dressing and using the lavatory.Â  She testified that after the surgery Clark was pain-free for four to six months, but his condition has since deteriorated.Â  \r\nClark testified his condition is somewhat better now than it was before the surgery.Â  However, he still has pain.Â  He can no longer enjoy hunting, camping, and fishing, his former hobbies.Â  The County has retired him on disability, and he has not worked since March of 2000.Â  Accordingly, we find substantial evidence in the record to support a finding of total and permanent disability.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the full commission correctly concluded that Clark has sustained a change of condition occurring after the prior award, which has rendered him totally and permanently disabled.Â  We further find no error in the full commission ordering the County to pay for the surgery and continuing treatment by Dr. Greenberg.Â  Accordingly, the order of the full commission is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n HEARN, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.  \r\n\r\n[1] In the original proceeding, the single commissioner noted the wide discrepancy between the conclusions of the experts and ordered an independent evaluation.Â  The parties sparred over which physician would perform the evaluation, and it was finally performed by Dr. James F. Bethea.Â  The original order considered Dr. Betheaâ€™s opinion, as well as that of Dr. Epstein and Dr. James K. Aymond.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] In fact, Dr. Epstein indicated surgery would be a viable course of action if Clark lost weight and stopped smoking. Clark testified he lost some weight and stopped smoking prior to the surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4024","title":"Stinecipher v.

Three months later, Ballington murdered Edna.[1]Â  \r\nAfter Ballington was arrested for the murder, the Stineciphers took physical custody of Austin and were granted temporary legal custody by an ex parte court order.Â  In October 1998, the trial court issued a temporary order, granting the Stineciphers custody and prohibiting any visitation between Austin and Ballingtonâ€™s extended family.Â Â  \r\nThree months after Ednaâ€™s murder, Ballington wrote his sister from jail and asked her to purchase several Christmas gifts for Austin.Â  According to Mr. Stinecipher, Ballingtonâ€™s brother insisted on personally delivering the gifts to Austin.Â  Such a delivery would have contravened the temporary order, which restrained visitation between Austin and Ballingtonâ€™s extended family, and Mr. Stinecipher refused to accept such a delivery.Â  Ballingtonâ€™s brother testified that Mr. Stinecipher emphatically refused to receive any gifts from\r\nBallington. \r\nIn June of 1999, Ballington petitioned the family court for visitation of Austin.Â  The family court issued an order appointing a guardian ad litem. Â No further hearing on the matter was ever requested.Â  However, throughout his incarceration, Ballington wrote letters to Austin.Â  Initially, he sent Austinâ€™s letters to the Stineciphers, but when he found out they did not accept delivery of the Christmas presents, Ballington began sending the letters to his sister.Â Â Â  Ballington also wrote separately to his sister, repeatedly asking about establishing visitation with Austin. \r\nAt the termination of parental rights (â€œTPRâ€) hearing, Mr. Stinecipher testified that in the three-and-a-half years he and his wife had custody of Austin, Ballington never sent any money for Austinâ€™s support.Â  In fact, although Ednaâ€™s estate was worth $500,000, those funds were not available for Austinâ€™s benefit because Ballington refused to forfeit his interest in Ednaâ€™s property and life insurance proceeds, and therefore, Ednaâ€™s estate had not yet closed.[2]Â  Ballington admitted he had never sent money to the Stineciphers, but testified that he believed Austinâ€™s support was being paid through rents collected from three properties he and Edna owned jointly.Â  Later in his testimony, however, Ballington admitted that Mr. Stinecipher was â€œnot supposed toâ€ use money from the three rental houses to support Austin.Â  \r\nThe family court refused to terminate Ballingtonâ€™s parental rights, finding no ground for termination was proved by clear and convincing evidence.[3]Â  The court further ruled that there was â€œno wayâ€ to find termination was in Austinâ€™s best interest because no expert testimony was offered.Â  Because it refused to terminate Ballingtonâ€™s parental rights, the family court dismissed the Stineciphersâ€™ petition to adopt Austin.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[I]n a TPR case, the appellate court has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.â€Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579-80, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1998)).Â  In this examination and in our determination, the best interest of the child is our paramount consideration.Â  Id. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  In addition, the grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.Â  Thus, this court may review the record and make its own findings as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the TPR.Â  Id. (citing S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the trial court or to ignore the fact that the court was in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses.Â  Id. at 580, 578 S.E.2d at 735 (citing Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Stineciphers argue the family court erred by not finding Ballington wilfully failed to support Austin.Â  We agree.\r\nParental rights may be terminated if the child has lived outside the home of either parent for six months and, during that time, â€œthe parent has wilfully failed to support the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2004).Â  According to section 20-7-1572(4): \r\n\r\nFailure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nWhether the failure to support is wilful is a question of intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 335, 542 S.E.2d 580, 582 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â  Wilfulness is conduct that â€œâ€˜evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992)).Â Â  \r\nIn declining to find Ballington had wilfully failed to support Austin, the family court noted that Mr. Stinecipher controlled money from rents in which Ballington had an interest, the Stineciphers never sought support, and Austin had an estate valued at $500,000.Â  However, none of these reasons convince us that Ballington provided for Austin, nor does Ballingtonâ€™s testimony indicate his failure to support Austin was unwilful.Â  \r\nIt is true, as the family court noted, that Mr. Stinecipher had â€œcontrolâ€ over the rents collected from the houses Ballington and Edna jointly owned.Â  However, this control stemmed from his being the personal representative of Ednaâ€™s estate and only allowed him to collect the rents and to make repairs to the properties as necessary.Â  Although Ballington testified at one point that he believed he was supporting Austin through the excess rents, he later admitted that Mr. Stinecipher was obligated to account for all the money collected on the houses and could only use the rent money collected to maintain the properties.Â  Thus, Ballingtonâ€™s assertion that he assumed the rent money was being used to support Austin is not credible.\r\nÂ  As for the $500,000 in Ednaâ€™s estate, that money was not available for Austinâ€™s benefit because the estate had not yet closed, and it was Ballingtonâ€™s refusal to forfeit his interest in the estate that caused this delay.[4]Â  Moreover, even if the $500,000 were available, that would not obviate Ballingtonâ€™s responsibility to make a material contribution to Austinâ€™s care according to Ballingtonâ€™s means. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-1572(4) (requiring parents to make a contribution to their childâ€™s care based on the parentsâ€™ means, not the childâ€™s need). Although Ballington maintained he could not support Austin because he generated no income while incarcerated, the record reflects Ballington had significant amounts of money at his disposal.Â Â  While incarcerated, Ballington inherited $30,000, all of which he used to pay his criminal defense attorney.Â  Even after spending this money on himself, he still had $4,400 in his checking account at the time of the TPR hearing, but admitted he never directed his brother, who had power of attorney, to write a check for Austinâ€™s support. [5] Â Cf. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 543 S.E.2d 580 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding family court should not have terminated parental rights of incarcerated father on ground of his wilful failure to support where prison policies prevented him from earning any income and he had no other source of income); see also S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 301 S.C. 308, 310, 391 S.E.2d 584, 585 (Ct. App. 1990) (explaining that incarceration of the parent does not relieve a parent from the duty to support the child).Â  \r\nFinally, although the family court noted that the Stineciphers never sought support, this factor is not determinative.Â  Prior to 1992, parental rights could not be terminated on the ground of failure to support unless the childâ€™s custodian requested support from the parent.Â  However, the legislature amended section 20-7-1572(4) in 1992 so that a custodianâ€™s request was not required, though the lack of a request could be considered along with all other relevant circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (â€œThe court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.â€); see also S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 296, 547 S.E.2d 506, 510 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting that nothing requires a parent be notified of his duty to support his child before failure to discharge this duty may serve as grounds for termination of parental rights).Â  Thus, Ballington was not relieved of his duty to support Austin merely because the Stineciphers never requested support.\r\nWe therefore find clear and convincing evidence that Ballington not only failed to send any money to aid in Austinâ€™s support, but that he actually prevented Austin from deriving the benefits of Ednaâ€™s estate.Â  Were it only a failure to send money to Austin, we might be inclined to defer to the trial courtâ€™s determination that such a failure was not wilful; however, considering Ballingtonâ€™s actions which actually impeded Austin from receiving money from his motherâ€™s estate, we are compelled to find Ballingtonâ€™s failure to provide for Austin was wilful.Â  Finding the Stineciphers proved a ground for termination of parental rights by clear and convincing evidence, we move on to determine whether termination would be in Austinâ€™s best interest.[6]  \r\nThe Stineciphers assert that the trial court erred in failing to find TPR and adoption were in Austinâ€™s best interest and in concluding that expert testimony was necessary to make such a finding.Â  We agree.\r\nIf the trial court finds a proven statutory ground for TPR, it must also find the best interest of the child would be served by TPR.[7]Â  See Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 581, 578 S.E.2d 733, 736 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the childâ€™s interests and the parentâ€™s interests conflict, the interests of the child shall prevail.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2004); see also S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 561, 340 S.E.2d 149, 153 (1986).Â  While the appointment of a guardian ad litem is required in TPR cases, there is no such requirement for expert testimony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1570(B) (Supp. 2004).Â  Family court judges often determine whether TPR is in a childâ€™s best interest without the aid of an expert.\r\nWe find persuasive evidence in the record indicating that termination of Ballingtonâ€™s rights to Austin would be in Austinâ€™s best interest.Â  Austin was only three-and-a-half years old when Ballington was incarcerated for the murder of Austinâ€™s mother, and Austin has since had no contact with Ballington.Â  Because Ballington is serving a sentence of life without parole,[8] there is no possibility that Austin would ever be able to have a normal father-son relationship with Ballington.Â  Moreover, as numerous witnesses testified, including the guardian, Austin has bonded with the Stineciphers and has thrived in their care. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on Ballingtonâ€™s wilful failure to support and because it is in Austinâ€™s best interest to do so, the parental rights of Ballington in and to Austin should be terminated.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is reversed and the petition for adoption is remanded.\r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This court affirmed Ballingtonâ€™s conviction for murder in State v. Ballington, 346 S.C. 262, 551 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  According to the facts set forth in that opinion, which was part of the family courtâ€™s record, Ballington gave a statement to police confessing to murdering Edna after she told him she was planning to seek full custody of Austin.Â Â Â  Id. at 266-67, 551 S.E.2d at 282-83.Â  Â Â \r\n[2] Shortly before the TPR hearing, Ballington had finally forfeited his interest in the estate after refusing to do so for three-and-a-half years.Â  \r\n[3] When the Stineciphers initially filed suit against Ballington in October 2000, South Carolinaâ€™s TPR statute did not yet have a ground related to the murder of the childâ€™s other parent.Â  On March 5, 2004, the TPR statute was amended to add the following ground for termination: â€œA parent of the child pleads guilty or nolo contendere to or is convicted of the murder of the childâ€™s other parent.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(10) (Supp. 2004).Â Â  However, the Stineciphers do not argue we should apply this statute retroactively, but rather ask us to reverse based only on Ballingtonâ€™s willful failure to support and willful failure to visit.\r\n[4] Ballington did not forfeit his interest in Ednaâ€™s property and insurance until three-and-a-half years after he murdered her.\r\n[5] During oral argument, Ballingtonâ€™s attorney argued that sending a check to the Stineciphers would have been futile because they would not have accepted it.Â  Such a conclusion is purely speculation, especially when letters Ballington sent to Austin via the Stineciphers were never returned to him. Although Mr. Stinecipher admitted he refused to allow Ballingtonâ€™s brother to personally deliver Christmas presents to Austin three months after Ednaâ€™s murder, this alone does not dictate how Mr. Stinecipher would have reacted to receiving a check in the mail.Â  Furthermore, when Ballington testified at the hearing, he never claimed that his failure to send a check was because he believed such an act would be futile.Â  \r\n[6] Because we find Ballington wilfully failed to support Austin, we need not address whether the Stineciphers proved any other ground for termination. \r\n[7] By contrast, a family court need not reach best interest when no ground for termination exists.Â  Despite this, the family court in this case ruled on best interest even though it found no ground for TPR was proved.\r\n[8] Though Ballington testified that he believed he would one day be freed from prison, the Lexington County Solicitor, Donnie Myers, testified that Ballington was serving a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4025","title":"Blind Tiger, LLC v.

City of Beaufort, 317 S.C. 481, 486, 454 S.E.2d 912,\r\n915 (Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp; Furthermore, our standard of review of a board of\r\narchitectural reviewâ€™s decision is the same as that of the trial court.&nbsp; Fairfield\r\nOcean Ridge, Inc. v. Town of Edisto Beach, 294 S.C. 475, 479-80, 366 S.E.2d\r\n15, 18 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding the appellate court will not reverse the circuit\r\ncourtâ€™s affirmance of the board unless the boardâ€™s findings of fact have no\r\nevidentiary support or the board commits an error of law).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBlind Tiger alleges the circuit\r\ncourt erred in dismissing its appeal as untimely.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nSection 6-29-900 of the South\r\nCarolina Code controls the appeal requirements from a board of architectural\r\nreview to the circuit court.&nbsp; Section 6-29-900 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  A person who may have a\r\n  substantial interest in any decision of the board of architectural review or\r\n  any officer, or agent of the appropriate governing authority may appeal from\r\n  any decision of the board to the circuit court in and for the county by filing\r\n  with the clerk of court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully,\r\n  and distinctly why the decision is contrary to law. The appeal must be filed\r\n  within thirty days after the affected party receives actual notice of\r\n  the decision of the board of architectural review.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Â§ 6-29-900(A) (2004)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nBlind Tiger contends it complied\r\nwith the requirement contained in section 6-29-900 as it appealed within thirty\r\ndays of receipt of the Boardâ€™s written notice of the decision.&nbsp; Blind\r\nTiger alleged it received written notice of the decision on January 30, 2004,\r\nand filed the appeal to the circuit court on February 2, 2004, which was within\r\nthe thirty-day period prescribed in section 6-29-900.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, Blind Tigerâ€™s argument\r\nignores the plain meaning of Section 6-29-900.&nbsp; That section mandates an\r\nappeal to the circuit court must be made â€œwithin thirty days after the\r\naffected party receives actual notice of the decision.â€&nbsp;\r\nThus, the triggering mechanism for filing an appeal is actual notice of the\r\nadverse decision, not receipt of the written notice.\r\nActual notice is synonymous with\r\nknowledge.&nbsp; Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332\r\nS.C. 54, 63 n.6, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 n.6 (1998).&nbsp; â€œNotice is regarded as\r\nactual where the person sought to be charged therewith either knows of the\r\nexistence of the particular facts in question or is conscious of having the\r\nmeans of knowing it, even though such means may not be employed by him.â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nBlind Tiger acknowledged its\r\nrepresentatives were present at the November 12, 2003 hearing of the Board when\r\nthe decision was rendered ordering Blind Tiger to remove the film within ten\r\ndays.&nbsp; Therefore, we find Blind Tiger had actual notice of the Boardâ€™s\r\ndecision on November 12, 2003, and Blind Tigerâ€™s failure to file an appeal\r\nuntil February 2, 2004, some 82 days after actual notice under section 6-29-900,\r\nrenders its appeal untimely.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of\r\nthe circuit court dismissing Blind Tigerâ€™s appeal as untimely is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] See Charleston Zoning Code Â§ 54-232.&nbsp; Section 54-231 defines â€œexterior\r\narchitectural appearanceâ€ as â€œthe type and character of all windows, doors,\r\nlight fixtures, signs and appurtenant elements, visible from a street or public\r\nthoroughfare.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4018","title":"Wellman v.

Smith, Â all of Chicago, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Washington Group International, Inc., the successor to Raytheon Engineers and Constructors, Inc. (Raytheon/Washington), appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of its motion to compel arbitration on behalf of itself and the Zimmer/Raytheon Consortium. We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRaytheon Engineers and Constructors, Inc. and Zimmer AG entered into a written agreement to form Zimmer/Raytheon Consortium for the purpose of constructing a manufacturing facility for Wellman, Inc.Â  The Consortium agreement provides:Â  â€œZimmer shall act as the CONSORTUIM LEADER for the term of this AGREEMENT.â€Â  In addition, the agreement contains the following arbitration provision: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        10.9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n         Claims between the MEMBERS regarding their respective rights and obligations under this AGREEMENT and/or under the CONTRACT shall be first addressed by the Management Committee.Â  If the Management Committee is unable to unanimously settle such claims within thirty (30) days, its settlement shall be determined according to Articles 10.9.2 through 10.9.4 below.Â  \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        10.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n         Not later than ninety (90) days after the end of said thirty day period either party may appeal its claim to non-binding mediation to the American Arbitration Association to be held in the City of Columbia, South Carolina, under its then effective rules and regulations. \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        10.9.3&nbsp; \r\n         Within thirty (30) days of the MEMBERâ€™S failure to reach agreement under such mediation and declaring an impasse or the conclusion of the mediation, either MEMBER may submit the claim to binding arbitration in accordance with the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (S.C. Code Â§ 15-48-10 et seq.) to be held in the City of Columbia, South Carolina. \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        10.9.4Â  \r\n         If and only if after all said measures have been undertaken by either MEMBER submit the claim to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction and then only to enforce such decision on its own terms or have it voided as arbitrary and capricious.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe agreement also contains an ipso facto provision stating, among other things, if a member of the Consortium becomes insolvent and commences a bankruptcy proceeding, the â€œInsolvent MEMBER (and/or receiver, trustee, liquidator or custodian) shall cease to have any further decision-making authority or vote under this AGREEMENT and the CONSORTIUM shall not require the vote, approval or authority of the Insolvent MEMBER as otherwise may have been required under this AGREEMENT.â€Â  \r\nThe Consortium entered into a contract with Wellman for the construction of the facility.Â  This agreement also contained a provision subjecting â€œ[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this CONTRACT or any breach thereofâ€ to â€œbinding arbitration in accordance with the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act (S.C. Code Â§ 15-48-10 et seq.).â€ \r\nSubsequent to the construction of the facility, an issue arose about payments due to Raytheon and Zimmer from Wellman and other issues.Â  As Raytheon and Zimmer disagreed as to how to handle these closeout issues, they entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the dispute.Â  The settlement agreement contained the following provision regarding the leadership of the Consortium: \r\n\r\n4. Raytheon as Leader of Remaining Consortium Activities  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          (a) \r\n           The rights and obligations of Raytheon and Zimmer under the Consortium Agreement are deemed completed and discharged in all respects and are of no further force or effect, except\r\n            (i) for the sole and exclusive purpose of serving as the vehicle for Raytheon to assert claims against Wellman and recover damages thereby as contemplated by this Agreement (and to defend any claims which may be asserted by Wellman in connection therewith), and (ii) as otherwise specifically provided herein.Â  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n           Raytheon shall hereafter become the Consortium â€œLeaderâ€ pursuant to Article 4 of the Consortium Agreement for the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this Section, specifically including the unilateral right to conduct negotiations with Wellman, to settle and resolve all claims and disputes with Wellman on behalf of the Consortium, but solely for the benefit of Raytheon, excluding, however, only those claims and disputes excepted from the application of Section 12 herein. \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe settlement agreement also contained the following arbitration provision: \r\n\r\n16.Â  Arbitration\r\nAny dispute or controversy between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement which cannot be settled amicably shall be resolved by arbitration in the manner provided for in Article 10.9 of the Consortium Agreement, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth at length herein. \r\n\r\nAfter Raytheon submitted its claim to Wellman, an electric malfunction occurred in the facility, and Wellman suffered damages in excess of eight million dollars.Â  Subsequently, Raytheon filed for bankruptcy pursuant to chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.Â  Washington Group International, Inc. acquired assets of Raytheon, including the division responsible for the Wellman project.Â  Wellman ultimately filed suit against Raytheon/Washington and Zimmer, individually and as Consortium members, for damages associated with the electrical malfunction.Â  Zimmer filed cross-claims against Raytheon/Washington for equitable and contractual indemnity.\r\nRaytheon/Washington filed a motion to stay Wellmanâ€™s claims against it and to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the Consortiumâ€™s agreement with Wellman.Â  Zimmer opposed Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s motion, asserting that it had the authority to speak for the Consortium and it preferred to resolve the suit in litigation.Â  Raytheon/Washington also filed a motion to stay Zimmerâ€™s cross-claim and to compel arbitration.Â  \r\nAfter reviewing the memoranda submitted by all the parties, the trial court denied Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s motions to compel arbitration.Â  The trial court found, pursuant to the ipso facto provision in the Consortium agreement, Raytheon lost its decision making authority regarding Consortium matters due to its insolvency and thus Raytheon did not have the right to demand arbitration in this matter when that action was contrary to the desires of Zimmer.Â  In addition, the court found â€œthat the interests of the parties and the court are best served by resolution of all related claims in one judicial forum.â€Â  Thus it held all of the claims by Wellman should be litigated in court.Â  Raytheon/Washington appeals the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether a claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.Â \r\nVestry &amp; Church Wardens of Church of Holy Cross v. Orkin Exterminating Co.,\r\n356 S.C. 202, 206, 588 S.E.2d 136, 138 (Ct. App. 2003). Â â€œNevertheless, a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if there is any evidence reasonably supporting the findings.â€Â  Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C., 357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Intertwining doctrine\r\nRaytheon/Washington argues the trial court erred in denying its motions to compel arbitration based on its finding that â€œthe interests of the parties and the courts are best served by resolution of all related claims in one judicial forum.â€Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWellman urges this court to adopt the intertwining doctrine.Â  The Colorado Supreme Court explained the purpose of this doctrine is to prevent inconsistent determinations by different forums.Â  City &amp; County of Denver v. District Court In &amp; For City &amp; County of Denver, 939 P.2d 1353, 1369 (Colo. 1997).Â  The court elucidated: \r\n\r\n\r\n  [The application of this doctrine] involves an analysis of the legal and factual issues relative to each of the factual allegations in the complaint. The court will consider whether the arbitrator would be required to â€œreview the same facts needed to establish the . . . [non-arbitrable claim]â€ . . . .Â  If the factual determinations and legal conclusions are inextricably intertwined, then the court must not sever the action.Â  To hold otherwise would risk inconsistent determinations and could result in the arbitratorâ€™s infringing upon the courtâ€™s duty to decide the [non-arbitrable claim]. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n    Id.Â  (quoting Lawrence St. Partners, Ltd. v. Lawrence St. Venturers, 786 P.2d 508, 511 (Colo. Ct. App. 1989)). \r\nThe United States Supreme Court expressly rejected the intertwining doctrine in Dean Witter Reynolds v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213 (1985).Â  The court held the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)[1] requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.Â  Id. at 217.Â  The FAA provides that written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising out of an existing contract â€œshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.â€Â  9 U.S.C. Â§ 2 (1999).Â  Considering this provision, the Supreme Court found:\r\n\r\nBy its terms, the [FAA] leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed.Â  Â§Â§ 3, 4.Â  Thus, insofar as the language of the [FAA] guides our disposition of this case, we would conclude that agreements to arbitrate must be enforced, absent a ground for revocation of the contractual agreement.\r\n\r\nDean Witter Reynolds, 470 U.S. at 218.\r\nSimilarly, the Arizona Court of Appeals rejected the intertwining doctrine as being inconsistent with its state arbitration act.Â  Hallmark Indus., L.L.C. v. First Systech Intâ€™l, 52 P.3d 812 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002).Â  The Arizona Arbitration Act contains identical language to our Arbitration Act, providing:\r\n\r\nA written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(a) (2005); A.R.S. Â§ 12-1501 (West 2003).\r\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals found, like the Supreme Court in Dean Witter Reynolds, that â€œthis language does not confer discretion on a trial court to ignore a valid arbitration agreement merely because a case involves related arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims, even if the claims are factually related and difficult to separate.â€Â \r\nHallmark, 52 P.3d at 814.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Arbitration Act, like the Arizona Arbitration Act, sets forth the procedure for when a case involves arbitrable and non-arbitrable issues.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(d) (2005); A.R.S. 12-1502(D) (West 2003).Â  These identical sections provide:\r\n\r\nAny action or proceeding involving an issue subject to arbitration shall be stayed if an order for arbitration or an application therefor has been made under this section or, if the issue is severable, the stay may be with respect thereto only.Â  When the application is made in such action or proceeding, the order for arbitration shall include such stay.\r\n\r\nId.Â \r\nAs the Arizona court noted, there is no language in this section authorizing a trial court to refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement.Â  See Hallmark, 52 P.3d at 815.Â  Instead, the trial court must stay the entire action or if the issues are severable, order the non-arbitratable issues to proceed with only the arbitrable issues being stayed.Â  \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003).Â  The words of a statute â€œmust be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its operation.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  Looking to the language of the Arbitration Act, we find no indication the legislature intended for the courts to be able to ignore an otherwise valid arbitration provision for the sake of judicial economy.Â  The Arbitration Act clearly provides the trial court must enforce an arbitration provision unless grounds â€œexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.â€Â  Thus, we find the intertwining doctrine is inconsistent with the intention of our legislature and decline to adopt it.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find the intertwining doctrine is in conflict with South Carolinaâ€™s judicial policy of favoring arbitration.Â  See Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001)(stating South Carolinaâ€™s policy is to favor the arbitration of disputes).Â  We recognize that having litigation and arbitration of intertwined issues may be inefficient and lead to inconsistent results.Â  However as the Arizona Court of Appeals recognized: â€œAny inefficiency or risk of inconsistent results is a consequence of the partiesâ€™ bargaining.â€Â  Hallmark, 52 P.3d at 815.Â  The court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms, regardless of the wisdom or folly or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.Â  Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 248, 449 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1994).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[i]f arbitration defenses could be foreclosed simply by adding as a defendant a person not a party to an arbitration agreement, the utility of such agreements would be seriously compromised.â€ Paine, Webber, Jackson, &amp; Curtis, Inc. v. McNeal, 239 S.E.2d 401, 404 (Ga. Ct. App. 1977) (quoting Hilti, Inc. v. Oldach, 392 F.2d 368, 369 n.2 (1st Cir. 1968)).\r\nWe conclude a trial court may not refuse to enforce an otherwise valid arbitration provision on the basis of judicial economy.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court erred in denying Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s motion to avoid â€œunnecessarily duplicate proceedings.â€Â  \r\nII.Â  NovationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRaytheon/Washington also argues the trial court erred in denying its motion to compel arbitration because the settlement agreement acted as a novation of the Consortium agreement, and therefore, the provision in the settlement agreement assigning Raytheon as leader superseded the ipso facto provision contained in the Consortium agreement.Â  Thus, Raytheon/Washington asserts it controlled the Consortium and had the authority to decide whether to enforce the arbitration provision in the Consortiumâ€™s agreement with Wellman.[2]\r\nWe first question whether this issue is preserved for our review.Â  Although Raytheon/Washington argued to the trial court that under the revised agreement, Raytheon/Washington was granted leadership in the Consortium and thus had authority to demand arbitration on behalf of the Consortium, it did not specifically argue that the Settlement Agreement constituted a novation of the Consortium agreement.Â  Furthermore, the trial court did not address the effect of the settlement agreement on the leadership of the Consortium, and Raytheon/Washington failed to request a ruling on the issue in a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997) (where trial judge did not rule on issue at trial and party did not make a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion for a ruling, issue is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nHowever, even on the merits, we find no error.Â  â€œA novation is an agreement between all parties concerned for the substitution of a new obligation between the parties with the intent to extinguish the old obligation.Â  The burden of proving novation is on the party asserting it.â€Â \r\nWayne Dalton Corp. v. Acme Doors, Inc., 302 S.C. 93, 96, 394 S.E.2d 5, 7 (Ct. App. 1990) (citation omitted).Â  â€œThe circumstances attending the transaction alleged to be a novation must show the intention to substitute a new obligation in place of the existing one.â€ Â Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners,\r\n261 S.C. 257, 262, 199 S.E.2d 719, 722 (1973).Â  \r\nBased on the language of the settlement agreement and a letter written to Wellman from the members of the Consortium, we find the parties did not intend for the settlement agreement to act as a novation of the Consortium agreement.Â  First, in our review of the settlement agreement, we find its purpose was only to deal with closeout issues with Wellman.Â  The agreement provides:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS Zimmer and Raytheon desire to resolve amicably their various disputes and controversies relating to the claims raised by Wellman and to the claims between each other resulting from the execution of the Contract and the Consortium Agreement, with, among other things, Zimmer waiving and providing a full release to Raytheon of any and all claims which Zimmer may have against Raytheon and assigning to Raytheon its claims against Wellman in exchange for Raytheon waiving and providing a full release to Zimmer of any and all claims which Raytheon may have against Zimmer, allÂ  and to the extent as more fully set forth below. \r\n\r\nAlso, numerous provisions in the settlement agreement incorporate by reference the terms of the Consortium agreement.Â  One example of this is the arbitration provision, which refers to the Consortium agreement for the procedures a party must follow in seeking to arbitrate a claim.Â  In addition, Zimmer and Raytheonâ€™s intent upon entering into the settlement agreement is evidenced by a letter to Wellman from the Consortium notifying Wellman of the settlement agreement.Â  This letter states, in part: \r\n\r\nThis letter is to inform Wellman that from now on Raytheon will serve as Leader of the Consortium on the H-12 Project to address financial closeout-related issues.Â  These closeout issues specifically include the defense of liquidated damages and backcharges assessed against the Consortium by Wellman, the recovery of unpaid Contract balances and the pursuit of affirmative claims by Raytheon against Wellman (hereinafter â€œcloseout issuesâ€).Â  \r\n\r\nTherefore, we find the parties intended to modify, but not nullify, the initial Consortium agreement by executing the settlement agreement.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Enforceability of ipso facto provision\r\nRaytheon/Washington further argues that even if the settlement agreement was not a novation, the ipso facto provision should not deprive it of its right to compel arbitration.Â  It contends it emerged from bankruptcy prior to the filing of Wellmanâ€™s action; thus, given the policy favoring arbitration, the trial court should have interpreted the ipso facto provision as inapplicable to resolve the matter in favor of arbitration.Â  Second, Raytheon/Washington argues the United States Bankruptcy Code invalidated the ipso facto provision contained in the Consortium agreement.Â  The section upon which Raytheon/Washington relies prohibits the termination or modification of an executory contract, in which the debtor is a party, upon the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding based on the debtor insolvency.Â  11 U.S.C.A. Â§ 365(e)(1) (West 2004).Â  \r\nRaytheon/Washington did not raise to the trial court any argument concerning the inapplicability the ipso facto provision or the validity of the provision under the bankruptcy code.Â  Additionally, the trial courtâ€™s order denying Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s motions does not specifically rule on these issues.Â  Therefore, we find these arguments are not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Summer, 328 S.C. at 43, 492 S.E.2d at 58 (where trial judge did not rule on issue at trial and party did not make a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion for a ruling, issue is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nII.Â  Preemption of Right to Arbitrate \r\nFinally, Raytheon/Washington argues that given the public policy favoring arbitration, its right to arbitration should not be impaired by it filing for bankruptcy.Â  \r\nBased on our reading of the trial courtâ€™s order, we find this argument misplaced.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nThis Court finds that under the Consortium Agreement, due to the undisputed insolvency of Raytheon, Raytheon does not have the right to demand arbitration in this matter when that action is contrary to the desires of Zimmer.Â  This result follows from Raytheonâ€™s insolvency and consequential loss of decision making authority regarding Consortium matters. \r\n\r\nBased on the trial courtâ€™s order, it did not determine Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s bankruptcy preempted its right to arbitration.Â  Rather, the trial court interpreted the provisions of the Consortium agreement and determined pursuant to that agreement, Raytheon/Washington did not have the right to make decisions for the Consortium, including the decision to enforce the arbitration provision under its agreement with Wellman.Â  Accordingly, we find no merit to this argument.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no merit in Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s argument that the settlement agreement constituted a novation.Â  Furthermore, we find Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s remaining arguments concerning the applicability and validity of the ipso facto provision are not preserved for our review.Â  We also find Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s argument the trial courtâ€™s decision was in error because a partyâ€™s right to arbitrate cannot be impaired by filing bankruptcy, is without merit.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s decision that Zimmer, rather than Raytheon/Washington, has the right to decide whether to arbitrate Wellmanâ€™s claims against the Consortium.Â  However, we find the trial court did err in holding that all claims must be resolved in one forum out of the interest of judicial economy.Â  Thus, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Raytheon/Washingtonâ€™s motion to compel arbitration only as it concerns Wellmanâ€™s claims against the Zimmer and Raytheon/Washington as members of the Consortium.Â  As to any other claims, the trial courtâ€™s order is reversed.Â  The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â Â  \r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] 9 U.S.C.A.

Wogan, initiated this action for negligence, loss of consortium, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Kenneth C. Kunze, M.D.; Hilton Head Gastroenterology, P.A.; Gary W. Thomas, M.D.; and Gary W. Thomas M.D., P.A.[1] (collectively â€œthe Doctorsâ€) on the claims for unfair trade practices, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of a third-party beneficiary contract, and a portion of the negligence cause of action based upon their alleged failures to file Medicare claims.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDr. Thomas administered chemotherapy to treat Mr. Wogan for rectal cancer.Â  By the end of the chemotherapy, Mr. Wogan had developed a severe case of high output/high frequency diarrhea.Â  The diarrhea caused malnutrition and dehydration, and consequently led to several hospitalizations.Â  Mr. Wogan was referred to Dr. Kunze for treatment of the gastrointestinal problem.Â  Dr. Kunze performed a colostomy in order to stop the diarrhea.Â  Unfortunately, the procedure did not remedy the problem.Â  The ordering and performance of this procedure makes up a portion of the medical malpractice action not subject to this appeal.\r\nDr. Kunze placed Mr. Wogan on the drug Sandostatin SC to alleviate his diarrheic condition.Â  After determining the drug was effective at controlling the diarrhea, Dr. Kunze informed the Wogans he would switch the prescription to Sandostatin LAR.Â  Sandostatin SC was inserted subcutaneously three times a day and was not covered by Medicare.Â  Sandostatin LAR is a long-acting version that would need to be injected once a month.Â  Ms. Wogan alleged Medicare would cover the drug if the diarrhea resulted from Mr. Woganâ€™s chemotherapy.Â  \r\nAccording to Ms. Wogan, Dr. Kunze originally indicated he would preorder the Sandostatin LAR, administer it in his office, and submit the claim to Medicare.Â  Later, Dr. Kunze notified Ms. Wogan he would not preorder the drug.Â  Dr. Kunzeâ€™s nurse suggested that Ms. Wogan consult with Dr. Thomas to see if he would prescribe and administer the medication, but Dr. Thomas would not, and represented he did not believe the diarrhea resulted from the chemotherapy. Â Eventually, Dr. Kunze agreed to administer the Sandostatin LAR, but required Ms. Wogan to purchase the monthly doses from a pharmacy.Â  He refused to file a Medicare claim for the drug.Â  The Wogans purchased Sandostatin LAR at a cost of $2000 per month for several months, and continued to insist either Dr. Kunze or Dr. Thomas assist with a Medicare claim.Â  \r\nMr. Woganâ€™s debilitating diarrhea persisted and resulted in several hospitalizations.Â  During one hospital stay, Dr. Thomas ordered Mr. Wogan to continue taking all prescribed medications, including the Sandostatin, but he did not actually write a prescription for the Sandostatin.Â  Mr. Wogan died in October 2001. \r\nOriginally, Ms. Wogan filed this action against Kenneth C. Kunze, M.D.; Hilton Head Gastroenterology, P.A.; Thomas P. Rzecycki, M.D.; Hilton Head General and Laparoscopic Surgery, P.A.Â  A year and a half later, Gary W. Thomas, M.D. and Gary W. Thomas M.D., P.A., were added as parties.Â  The complaint asserts claims for (1) negligence based on both medical malpractice from the surgery and failures by the Doctors to file claims or help Ms. Wogan file a claim with Medicare for the Sandostatin LAR; (2) breaches of the Doctorsâ€™ contracts with Medicare under which it was alleged Mr. Wogan was a third-party beneficiary; (3) violations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act; (4) breaches of fiduciary duty by the Doctors in failing to file the Medicare claim; andÂ  (5) loss of consortium.Â  \r\nThe Doctors filed motions for summary judgment on all but the medical malpractice and loss of consortium claims. In their memoranda submitted to the court, they contend there is no private right of action provided in the Medicare statute, and Ms. Woganâ€™s complaint for negligence regarding their failures to file Medicare claims was merely a claim for violation of the Medicare Act.Â  Additionally, the Doctors maintained the action for unfair trade practices must fail because the medical field is a regulated industry.Â  Finally, they argued there was no fiduciary duty to file the claim.Â  Dr. Thomas contended he could not be found negligent because he never actually prescribed the medicine; thus, it would have been fraud had he submitted a claim to Medicare.Â  \r\nThe trial court agreed with the Doctors and granted summary judgment as to the negligence action based on the failure to file a Medicare claim.Â  The court found there is no private right of action, either expressed or implied, in the Medicare Act.Â  Furthermore, the court ruled Ms. Wogan could not use a state law claim to assert an action based on the Doctorsâ€™ failure to follow a federal act when the act does not provide for a private right of action.Â  \r\nAccording to the court, Ms. Wogan could not maintain her suit for unfair trade practices because as an individual she did not demonstrate an ascertainable loss, and the statute prohibits her from bringing a claim in a representative capacity.Â  The court further rejected the breach of fiduciary duty claim because the only breaches alleged were for medical malpractice and failure to file a claimâ€”both of which Ms. Wogan alleged in her negligence cause of action.Â  Finally, the court concluded the allegations against Dr. Thomas failed, as he never prescribed the medicine, and therefore, had no duty to file a Medicare claim. Ms. Woganâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Co., Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 609 S.E.2d 565 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 608 S.E.2d 587 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 611 S.E.2d 485 (2005); BPS, Inc. v. Worthy, 362 S.C. 319, 608 S.E.2d 155 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 607 S.E.2d 63 (2004); see also Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (Apr. 7, 2005) (stating that all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.Â  Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 613 S.E.2d 533 (2005); Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 605 S.E.2d 744 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Rife, 363 S.C. at 214, 609 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMs. Wogan contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Doctors on four of her claims.Â  She maintains her negligence action is not based upon the Medicare Act, but upon state law claims. Â Additionally, she contends she should not be barred from bringing the causes of action for breach of a third-party beneficiary contract, unfair trade practices, and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Medicare Act\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Background\r\nFirst, we address the issue of whether there is an express or implied right of action under the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C.A. Â§1395.Â  We find there is no right of action, either express or implied, relating to the failure of a physician to file a claim under 42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1395w-4(g)(4)(A).\r\nThe portion of the Medicare Act requiring submission of claims by physicians states:\r\n\r\n(4) Physician submission of claims\r\n(A) In general\r\nFor services furnished on or after September 1, 1990, within 1 year after the date of providing a service for which payment is made under this part on a reasonable charge or fee schedule basis, a physician, supplier, or other person (or an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1395u(b)(6)(A) of this\r\ntitle)\r\n(i) shall complete and submit a claim for such service on a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to the carrier on behalf of a beneficiary, and\r\n(ii) may not impose any charge relating to completing and submitting such a form.\r\n(B) Penalty\r\n(i) With respect to an assigned claim wherever a physician, provider, supplier or other person (or an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1395u(b)(6)(A) of this title) fails to submit such a claim as required in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reduce by 10 percent the amount that would otherwise be paid for such claim under this part.\r\n(ii) If a physician, supplier, or other person (or an employer or facility in the cases described in section 1395u(b)(6)(A) of this title) fails to submit a claim required to be submitted under subparagraph (A) or imposes a charge in violation of such subparagraph, the Secretary shall apply the sanction with respect to such a violation in the same manner as a sanction may be imposed under section 1395u(p)(3) of this title for a violation of section 1395u(p)(1) of this title.\r\n\r\n42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1395w-4(g)(4).\r\nMs. Wogan concedes there is no express provision in the Act allowing her to sue the physicians for failing to file a claim.Â  The Act provides for penalties and sanctions, but no private cause of action.Â  Therefore, we must determine whether an implied right of action for failing to file a claim exists.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\nAlthough several federal courts have confronted the question whether the Medicare Act gives rise to an implied right of action, neither the state nor the federal courts in South Carolina have decided the issue.Â  One case from a South Carolina Federal District Court stated the issue without answering it: â€œ. . . this court expresses no opinion on the question of whether a private cause of action in favor of the Medicare recipients themselves could be implied under U.S.C. s 1395a.â€Â  Home Health Servs., Inc. v. Currie, 531 F.Supp. 476 (D.S.C. 1982), affâ€™d 706 F.2d 497 (4th Cir. 1983).Â  The Currie case, however, is of no help as it lucidly expresses no opinion whether or not a private cause of action may be implied under the Medicare Act.Â  \r\nA federal court in Florida opined:\r\n\r\nCongress has not, statutorily, provided any private federal right of action or remedy under the Medicare or Medicaid Acts.Â  See 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1395, 1396.Â  Even if the Medicare and Medicaid Acts created some substantive rights, the statutes contain â€œnumerous provisions short of judicial enforcement that are designed to redress recipientsâ€™ grievances.â€ Â See Stewart v. Bernstein, 769 F.2d 1088, 1093 (5th Cir. 1985).Â  Congress did not intend to provide a private right of action under the Medicare or Medicaid Acts[.]\r\n\r\nEstate of Ayres ex rel. Strugnell v. Beaver, 48 F.Supp.2d 1335, 1339-40 (M.D.Fla. 1999). \r\nIn Brogdon ex rel. Cline v. National Healthcare Corp., 103 F.Supp.2dÂ  1322 (N.D.Ga. 2000), the court was presented with the question â€œwhether Congress intended to authorize nursing home residents to file suit against nursing homes to enforce the standards required for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.â€Â  Id. at 1330.Â  The court concluded â€œCongress did not intend to create such a remedyâ€[:]\r\n\r\nThe great majority of courts have determined that the Medicare and Medicaid Acts do not authorize private causes of action against nursing homes.Â  See Wheat v. Mass, 994 F.2d 273, 276 (5th Cir. 1993); Stewart v. Bernstein, 769 F.2d 1088, 1092-93 (5th Cir. 1985); Estate of Ayres v. Beaver, 48 F.Supp.2d 1335, 1339-40 (M.D.Fla. 1999); Nichols v. St. Luke Ctr., 800 F.Supp. 1564, 1568 (S.D.Ohio 1992); Chalfin v. Beverly Enters., Inc., 741 F.Supp. 1162, 1170-71 (E.D.Pa. 1989); Fuzie v. Manor Care, Inc., 461 F.Supp. 689, 697 (N.D.Ohio 1977). But see Roberson v. Wood, 464 F.Supp. 983, 988-89 (E.D.Ill. 1979). These courts found nothing in the text or legislative history of the Medicaid or Medicare Acts before the OBRA '87 amendments to suggest that Congress intended to create a private cause of action.\r\n\r\nBrogdon, 103 F.Supp.2d at 1331-32.\r\nAdditionally, courts have ruled the Medicaid Act does not give rise to an implied right of action.Â  In Solter v. Health Partners of Philadelphia, Inc., 215 F.Supp.2d 533 (E.D.Pa. 2002), after reciting the Cort test, the court noted that the Supreme Court â€œhas made clear that the second factor is the most important in determining whether an implied right of action exists.Â  See Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 363, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1(1992) (â€˜[T]he most important inquiry here . . . is whether Congress intended to create the private remedy sought by the plaintiffs.â€™).â€Â  Id. at 538.Â  â€œIn making this determination, courts must examine the statuteâ€™s language, structure, and legislative history.Â  Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers Union, 451 U.S. 77, 91-94, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981).â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).Â  As to congressional intent, the Solter court found â€œthere is no indication in the legislative history of the Medicaid Act that Congress intended to create a private remedy for a private care patient to bring a private action for money damages under the statute.Â  Steward v. Bernstein, 769 F.2d 1088, 1093 n.6 (5th Cir. 1985).â€Â  Moreover, \r\n\r\nthe Medicaid Act actually mandates that the participating states create a voluntary administrative process whereby beneficiaries may seek redress for an allegedly wrongful withholding of benefits . . . . This mandate is evidence that Congress anticipated that the states would provide the remedy for vindication of the guidelines and waiver provisions of the Medicaid Act.Â  In other words, there is a remedy available to plaintiffs for the wrong they allege in a state-created forum, rather than in federal court.Â Â  \r\n\r\nSolter, 215 F.Supp.2d at 539.Â  \r\nBecause there is no South Carolina authority resolving this question, and only minimal guidance from other jurisdictions, we turn to the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s prescriptions and doctrinal edifications as to when a private right of action may be implied from a federal statute.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Implied Right of Action \r\nDuring the early era of American jurisprudence, courts addressed the propriety of implying a private cause of action from a federal statute with the maxim, â€œFor every wrong there is a remedy.â€Â  See Susan J. Stabile, The Role of Congressional Intent in Determining the Existence of Implied Private Rights of Action, 71 Notre Dame L. Rev. 861, 864 (1996) (â€œThe early view of the courts on the question of when it is appropriate to imply a private cause of action from a federal statute that itself does not provide for such an action was that an individual is entitled to an adequate remedy for any legal wrong, whether common law wrong or statutory wrong.â€)Â  â€œSince there was a remedy for all wrongs, if Congress did not provide for that remedy, the courts should and did.â€Â  Id.Â  However, towards the end of the nineteenth century, the paradigmatic tide began to shift as congressional intent increasingly began to inform courtsâ€™ implied right of action analyses.Â  See id., citing Johnson v. S. Pac. Co., 196 U.S. 1 (1904).Â  With the New Deal and the efflux of federal legislation that followed came a â€œmore restrictive notion of when to imply private causes of action from federal statutes.â€Â  Id. at 865.Â  \r\nFor example, in 1916, the Supreme Court, in Texas &amp; Pacific Railway v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33 (1916), had implied a private cause of action under the â€œsafety appliance acts.â€Â  The Court observed that â€œ[n]one of the acts, indeed, contains express language conferring a right of action for the death or injury of an employee; but the safety of employees and travelers is their principal object, and the right of private action by an injured employee, even without the employersâ€™ liability act, has never been doubted.â€Â  241 U.S. at 39 (citations omitted).Â  Continuing, the Court explained:\r\n\r\nA disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default is implied, according to a doctrine of the common law expressed in 1 Comynâ€™s Dig. title, â€˜Action upon Statuteâ€™ (F), in these words: â€˜So, in every case, where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the said law.â€™\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).Â  \r\nBy 1934, the tenor of the Courtâ€™s voice had changed slightly.Â  In Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., 291 U.S. 205 (1934), the Court held that the original Federal Safety Appliance Act, \r\n\r\nwhile prescribing absolute duties, and thus creating correlative rights in favor of injured employees, did not attempt to lay down rules governing actions for enforcing these rights.Â  The original act of 1893 made no provision for suits, except for penalties.Â  That act did impliedly recognize the employeeâ€™s right of action by providing in section 8 that he should not be deemed to have assumed the risk of injury occasioned by the breach of duty.Â  But the act made no provision as to the place of suit or the time within which it should be brought, or as to the right to recover, or as to those who should be the beneficiaries of recovery, in case of the death of the employee.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 215.Â  Thus, the Moore Court â€œheld that the adjudicatory consequences of the Federal Safety Appliance Act were limited to those expressly provided by Congress.â€Â  71 Notre Dame L. Rev. at 865.Â  \r\n\r\nMoore was followed by the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, which, although not itself an implication case, rejected the ability of federal courts to create federal common law in diversity cases. . . . In the wake of Erie, federal courts appeared less willing to borrow state law negligence concepts to justify implying causes of action from federal statutes.\r\nFollowing Erie, the Supreme Court frequently denied private rights of action.Â  In doing so, the Court focused upon the availability of other means to enforce the statutory duty at issue. . . .\r\nStill, in the period prior to 1975, courts did create implied rights of actions when they were thought to be necessary to grant a plaintiff some remedy.\r\n\r\nId. at 866-67 (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\nThe year 1975 brought the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975).Â  There, the Court delineated a four-factor test:\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant.Â  First, is the plaintiff â€˜one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,â€™â€”that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff?Â  Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one?Â  Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?Â  And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?Â Â  \r\n\r\n422 U.S. at 78 (citations omitted).Â  However, Cortâ€™s â€œnew method of analyzing implication questions,â€ soon gave way to â€œan exclusive reliance on legislative intent.â€ 71 Notre Dame L. Rev. at 867-68.Â  \r\n\r\nThe movement started in Cannon v. University of Chicago, in which the Court held that there was a private right of action under section 901 of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.Â  Although the Court analyzed each of the four Cort factors, it expressly viewed the four factors as the means thorough which congressional intent could be discerned.\r\n\r\nId. at 868.Â  See also Rogers v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 611 F.2d 1074, 1088 (5th Cir. 1980) (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (â€œOnly a cave dweller . .Â  . would not realize that there has been a remarkable change of attitude by the Supreme Court regarding the inference of private rights of action in the last fifteen years.â€) (quoted in Home Health Services, Inc. v. Currie, 531 F.Supp. 476 (D.S.C. 1982)).\r\nThe manner by which the Court currently determines whether an implicit private cause of action is created by a federal statute is exemplified by Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560 (1979):\r\n\r\nThe question of the existence of a statutory cause of action is, of course, one of statutory construction. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 688, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1953, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); see National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974) (hereinafter Amtrak). SIPCâ€™s argument in favor of implication of a private right of action based on tort principles, therefore, is entirely misplaced. Brief for Respondent SIPC 22-23. As we recently have emphasized, â€œthe fact that a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of that person.â€ Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, 441 U.S., at 688, 99 S.Ct., at 1953. Instead, our task is limited solely to determining whether Congress intended to create the private right of action . . . .\r\n\r\n442 U.S. at 568 (emphasis added).Â  The Court has further elucidated:\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a federal statute that does not expressly provide for a particular private right of action nonetheless implicitly created that right, our task is one of statutory construction. See Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 568, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2485, 61 L.Ed.2d 82. The ultimate question in cases such as this is whether Congress intended to create the private remedyâ€”for example, a right to contributionâ€”that the plaintiff seeks to invoke. See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15-16, 100 S.Ct. 242, 245, 62 L.Ed.2d 146; Universities Research Assn., Inc., supra, at 770, 101 S.Ct., at 1461. Factors relevant to this inquiry are the language of the statute itself, its legislative history, the underlying purpose and structure of the statutory scheme, and the likelihood that Congress intended to supersede or to supplement existing state remedies.\r\n\r\nNorthwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, 451 U.S. 77, 91 (1981).\r\nThe Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001) is particularly instructive:\r\n\r\nLike substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress.Â  Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 578, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979) (remedies available are those â€œthat Congress enacted into lawâ€).Â  The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.Â  Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979).Â  Statutory intent on this latter point is determinative.Â  See, e.g., Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1102, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 812, n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986) (collecting cases).Â  Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.Â  See, e.g., Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 145, 148, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, supra, at 23, 100 S.Ct. 242; Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, supra, at 575-576, 99 S.Ct. 2479.Â  â€œRaising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for common-law courts, but not for federal tribunals.â€ Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350, 365, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\r\nRespondents would have us revert in this case to the understanding of private causes of action that held sway 40 years ago when Title VI was enacted.Â  That understanding is captured by the Courtâ€™s statement in J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964), that â€œit is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purposeâ€ expressed by a statute.Â  We abandoned that understanding in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975)â€”which itself interpreted a statute enacted under the ancien regimeâ€”and have not returned to it since.Â  Not even when interpreting the same Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that was at issue in Borak have we applied Borakâ€™s method for discerning and defining causes of action.Â  See Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., supra, at 188, 114 S.Ct. 1439; Musick, Peeler &amp; Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U.S. 286, 291-293, 113 S.Ct. 2085, 124 L.Ed.2d 194 (1993); Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, supra, at 1102-1103, 111 S.Ct. 2749; Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, supra, at 576-578, 99 S.Ct. 2479.Â  Having sworn off the habit of venturing beyond Congressâ€™s intent, we will not accept respondentsâ€™ invitation to have one last drink.\r\n\r\n532 U.S. at 286-87.\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Application\r\nAdverting our discussion from the historical evolvement of the implied right of action doctrine to the case sub judice, we find nothing in the language of the statute to indicate Congress intended an implicit right to file a private cause of action against a physician for failing to file a Medicare claim.Â  As the United States Supreme Court stated in Northwest Airlines:\r\n\r\nâ€œA frequently stated principle of statutory construction is that when legislation expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.â€ National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646.\r\n\r\n451 U.S. at 94 n.30.Â  \r\nThe Medicare Act provides for specific remedies in the form of sanctions and penalties, and this weighs against finding that Congress intended to create the remedy of a private right of action.Â  Unless congressional intent can be â€œinferred from the language of the statute, the statutory structure, or some other source, the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist.â€Â  Id. at 94.Â  Here, we are unable to discover any manifestation of intent on the part of Congress to create a right to bring a private action against the physicians for failing to properly file a Medicare claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1395w-4(g)(4).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Negligence\r\nWe find the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the portion of the negligence cause of action based upon the Doctorsâ€™ failures to file Medicare claims.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Failure to File\r\nMrs. Wogan contends the Doctors are liable for damages:\r\n\r\nIn negligently and recklessly failing to address the constant pleas from the Decedent and the Plaintiff for help in submitting a Medicare claim;\r\nIn negligently and recklessly failing to submit a Medicare claim on or about May 25, 2001, on or about June 22, 2001, on or about July 20, 2001, on or about August 24, 2001, and thereafter . . . . \r\n\r\nBoth of these claims arise specifically from the failure of the Doctors to follow the provision of 42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1395w-4(g)(4)(A) requiring them to submit a claim.Â  Ms. Wogan relies on affidavits as well as guidelines, which refer to the Medicare Act and its requirement that physicians file claims.Â  Essentially, Ms. Wogan is asserting an action for violation of the Medicare Act under the rubric of a state law claim.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the Doctors on Ms. Woganâ€™s cause of action for negligence based on the Doctorsâ€™ failures to file a Medicare claim.\r\nMs. Wogan alternatively maintains the violations of the statute are either evidence of negligence per se, or â€œindicia of negligenceâ€ that should be considered in a broader scope than just as a violation of the Medicare Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Negligence Per Se\r\nNegligence per se is negligence arising from a defendantâ€™s violation of a statute.Â  Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 134, 558 S.E.2d 271, 275 (Ct. App. 2001). In Rayfield v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1988), we enunciated the test for determining when a duty created by statute will support an action for negligence:\r\n\r\nIn order to show that the defendant owes him a duty of care arising from a statute, the plaintiff must show two things:Â  (1) that the essential purpose of the statute is to protect from the kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and (2) that he is a member of the class of persons the statute is intended to protect.\r\nIf the plaintiff makes this showing, he has proven the first element of a claim for negligence: viz., that the defendant owes him a duty of care.Â  If he then shows that the defendant violated the statute, he has proven the second element of a negligence cause of action: viz., that the defendant, by act or omission, failed to exercise due care.Â  This constitutes proof of negligence per se.\r\n\r\nId. at 103, 374 S.E.2d at 914-15 (footnote omitted).Â  â€œIn a subsequent decision, our Supreme Court further extended the analysis by stating that â€˜the plaintiff must prove violation of the statute was causally linked, both in fact and proximately, to the injury.â€™â€Â  Hurst v. Sandy, 329 S.C. 471, 478, 494 S.E.2d 847, 850 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 55, 410 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1991)).\r\nIn the instant case, the Medicare Act was not created to protect from a harm, but instead to create â€œa voluntary insurance program to provide medical insurance benefits in accordance with the provisions of this part for aged and disabled individuals who elect to enroll under such program[.]â€Â  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1395j.Â  While section 1395w-4(g) provides a requirement for the filing of a Medicare claim, it was not designed to protect from a harm.Â  It is an administrative section designed to maintain the orderly operation and handling of the program.Â  Accordingly, we reject the claim that the references to the Medicare Act provide a basis for a negligence per se claim.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Indicia of Negligence\r\nFinally, Ms. Woganâ€™s argument that the references are only â€œindicia of negligenceâ€ does not satisfy the requirements of a negligence claim.Â  A party must show a duty that was breached.Â  See Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 154, 607 S.E.2d 63, 67 (2004) (finding plaintiff in a medical malpractice action must show duty on the part of the physician); Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 470, 605 S.E.2d 556, 560 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIn order to prove negligence, the plaintiff must show: (1) defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.â€); Andrade v. Johnson, 356 S.C. 238, 245, 588 S.E.2d 588, 592 (2003) (same); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 668, 582 S.E.2d 432, 443 (Ct. App. 2003) (same).Â  There is no duty to either Mr. or Ms. Wogan unless an implicit right of action exists under the Medicare Act.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the Doctors on Ms. Woganâ€™s claims of negligence based on the failure to file a Medicare claim.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Breach of Third-Party Beneficiary Contract\r\nMs. Wogan contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Doctors on her claim they breached their contract to provide Medicare-covered services.Â  She maintains Mr. Wogan was a third-party beneficiary of the contract, and their failure to submit the claim renders them liable for breach.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a third person not in privity of contract with the contracting parties has no right to enforce a contract.Â Â  However, when the contract is made for the benefit of the third person, that person may enforce the contract if the contracting parties intended to create a direct, rather than an incidental or consequential, benefit to such third person.Â  \r\n\r\nGoode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 445, 494 S.E.2d 827, 833 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Bob Hammond Constr. Co. v. Banks Constr. Co., 312 S.C. 422, 440 S.E.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1994)).\r\nThe only contract appearing in the record is the Medicare Participating Physician/Supplier Agreement.Â  It states:Â  \r\n\r\nThe above-named person or organization [Dr. Kunze], called â€œthe participant,â€ hereby enters into an agreement with the Medicare program to accept assignment of the Medicare Part B payment for all services for which the participant is eligible to accept assignment under the Medicare law and regulations and which are furnished while this agreement is in effect.Â  \r\n\r\nThis document defines assignment, sets forth the effective date of the contract, and establishes the terms for termination of the agreement.Â  The contract contains no provisions specifically detailing the requirement to submit a claim or any liability resulting from the physicianâ€™s failure to file.Â  \r\nNothing in the contract creates liability outside the Medicare Act.Â  Because the Act does not confer a private right of action to sue a physician for failing to submit a claim, we refuse to allow an action against a physician on the ground he breached his contract to provide services outlined in the Medicare Act.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nMs. Wogan argues the trial court erred in finding her claims that the Doctors breached their fiduciary duties were mere restatements of her claims for medical negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nA fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust and confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 519, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 670, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444 (Ct. App. 2003); Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 476, 581 S.E.2d 496, 505 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (Mar. 18, 2004).Â  A fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one imposing the confidence.Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458, 578 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina has recognized the doctor-patient relationship as a confidential relationship.Â  McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 639, 494 S.E.2d 431, 437 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Hodge v. Shea, 252 S.C. 601, 608, 168 S.E.2d 82, 85 (1969).Â  However, this state has not found that medical negligence or malpractice will support a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Nor have our courts found the failure of a doctor to offer assistance in filing a Medicare claim or other claim is a breach of fiduciary duty.Â  \r\nIn McCormick, this Court found actionable a doctorâ€™s breach of the duty to maintain the confidences of his or her patient where no compelling public interest or other justification for the disclosure exists.Â  McCormick, 328 S.C. at 640, 494 S.E.2d at 437.Â  In Hodge, the court found a doctor owed a duty not to use undue influence in a sale of land over a patient with decreased mental capacity as a result of age and disease.Â  Hodge, 252 S.C. at 608-09, 168 S.E.2d at 85.\r\nIn the action sub judice, Ms. Woganâ€™s complaint asserted the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty was based upon the Doctorsâ€™ â€œfiduciary duty to provide appropriate medical treatment and care . . . in his time of need and in a prompt, efficient, proper, professional, ethical, competent and appropriate manner.â€Â  The complaint alleges the Doctors had duties to:\r\n\r\na.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Promptly purchase the Sandostatin LAR while the Decedent, JAMES JOHN WOGAN, remained under their continuous care and treatment and then promptly submit a Medicare claim, failure to do so constitutes abandonment; or\r\nb.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Promptly require the Decedent, JAMES JOHN WOGAN, to sign an Advanced Beneficiary Notice, promptly purchase the Sandostatin LAR Depot and then promptly submit a Medicare claim, failure to do so constitutes abandonment; or\r\nc.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Provide the injection via an outpatient procedure; or\r\nd.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Answer the pleas from the Decedent and/or the Plaintiff for assistance in alternative means of financing a Thirty Thousand ($30,000.00) Dollar a year medication; or\r\ne.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Other duties.Â  \r\n\r\nThese allegations are restatements of the basic charges raised in the medical negligence or malpractice cause of action in the complaint.Â  We find the assertions do not rise to the level of a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Doctors.Â  To hold the Doctors liable for failure to file the Medicare claim would render meaningless our ruling that there is no private right of action arising under the Medicare Act.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the Doctors on Ms. Woganâ€™s cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Unfair Trade Practices\r\nMs. Wogan asseverates the court improperly granted summary judgment to Dr. Kunze on the cause of action for violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, section 39-5-140 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn unfair trade practice has been defined as a practice which is offensive to public policy or which is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.â€Â  deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 269, 536 S.E.2d 399, 407 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).Â  â€œEven a truthful statement may be deceptive if it is has a capacity or tendency to deceive.â€Â  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  To be actionable under the UTPA, the unfair or deceptive act or practice must have an impact upon the public interest.Â  Id. (citing Haley Nursery Co. v. Forrest, 298 S.C. 520, 381 S.E.2d 906 (1989)).Â  â€œAn impact on the public interest may be shown if the acts or practices have the potential for repetition.â€Â  Singleton v. Stokes Motors, Inc., 358 S.C. 369, 379, 595 S.E.2d 461, 466 (2004) (citing Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 387, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998)). \r\nThe potential for repetition may be shown in either of two ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n(1) by showing the same kind of actions occurred in the past, thus making it likely they will continue to occur absent deterrence; or&nbsp;\r\n\r\n (2) by showing the companyâ€™s procedures created a potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nSection 39-5-140 states:\r\n\r\nAny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages.Â  If the court finds that the use or employment of the unfair or deceptive method, act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of Â§ 39-5-20, the court shall award three times the actual damages sustained and may provide such other relief as it deems necessary or proper.Â  Upon the finding by the court of a violation of this article, the court shall award to the person bringing such action under this section reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Doctors because it found (1) Ms. Wogan brought the action in her representative capacity as the personal representative of her husbandâ€™s estate; and (2) she, in her individual capacity, did not show evidence of an ascertainable loss suffered. \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Preservation \r\nFirst, Ms. Wogan argues the trial court improperly based its grant of summary judgment on a ground not raised by the Doctors.Â  This issue is not properly preserved.Â  While Ms. Wogan noted in her motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, that the court sua sponte made findings of fact regarding the claim, she presented no argument or authority to show this was error.Â  Thus, the issue was not properly presented to the trial court.Â  See In re Estate of Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 923 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding if a trial judge grants â€œrelief not previously contemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appealâ€). \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Theory of Recovery\r\nAt the summary judgment motion hearing, Ms. Woganâ€™s counsel argued the basis for the claim was Dr. Kunzeâ€™s continued billing of Mr. Wogan for the injections of Sandostatin LAR.Â  Her counsel specifically stated the cause of action was supported without any reference to the Medicare Act.Â  The bill was sent to Mr. Wogan and was based upon services rendered to him.Â  Ms. Wogan never claimed an individual loss as a result of the â€œinaccurate, deceptive bill.â€Â  \r\nMs. Wogan now maintains she suffered an ascertainable loss because she paid for the Sandostatin LAR at the pharmacy.Â  However, payment of the drug did not form the basis of the argument she presented at the summary judgment hearing, and Ms. Wogan cannot now change her theory of recovery.Â  See Easterlin v. Green, 248 S.C. 389, 395, 150 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1966) (finding a party may not argue one theory before the trial court and another on appeal); see also Crawford v. Henderson, 356 S.C. 389, 409, 589 S.E.2d 204, 215 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5-6, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (stating a party may not argue one ground at trial and then an alternative ground on appeal)).Â  \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Ascertainable Loss\r\n\r\n Nevertheless, Ms. Woganâ€™s Unfair Trade Practices Act claim is unprevailing on the merits.Â \r\n\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (1985), any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages. \r\n\r\nReynolds v. Ryland Group, Inc. 340 S.C. 331, 333, 531 S.E.2d 917, 918-19 (2000).Â Â  \r\nWe are constrained to analyze the Unfair Trade Practices Act claim with reference to Ms. Woganâ€™s original contention that the unfair trade practice was Dr. Kunzeâ€™s billing for the administration of the Sandostatin LAR.Â  There is no evidence in the record that Ms. Wogan paid this bill for $11.76.Â  Furthermore, the medical services at issue here were rendered to Mr. Wogan.Â  She has not demonstrated an ascertainable loss based on the alleged unfair billing.\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Representative Capacity\r\nFinally, an unfair trade practices claim may not be brought in a representative capacity.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (Supp. 2004) (â€œAny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money . . . as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages.â€) (emphasis added).Â  Losses incurred by Mr. Wogan are inapposite here because Ms. Wogan is not permitted to assert a claim on his behalf.Â  Because she did not demonstrate an ascertainable loss, and an action for losses incurred by Mr. Wogan cannot be maintained, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment.Â  \r\nVI.Â Â Â  Dr. Thomas\r\nMs. Wogan contends the trial court improperly granted summary judgment to Dr. Thomas on the ground he never prescribed the medication.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to support a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must prove the existence of a duty.Â  See Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 429, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002); Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999).Â  â€œGenerally, there is no common law duty to act. . . . Thus, a person usually incurs no liability when he fails to take steps to protect others from harm not created by his own wrongful conduct.â€Â  Dennis by Evans v. Timmons, 313 S.C. 338, 342, 437 S.E.2d 138, 141 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nWe find the court properly granted summary judgment to Dr. Thomas and Gary W. Thomas, M.D., P.A., because Dr. Thomas never prescribed the medication Sandostatin LAR and had no duty to file a claim with Medicare, or to help Ms. Wogan file a claim with Medicare.Â  Indubitably, Dr. Thomas has no duty to file a Medicare claim for medicine he has not prescribed.Â  Accordingly, we rule the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Dr. Thomas and Gary W. Thomas, M.D., P.A. due to the inability of Ms. Wogan to demonstrate they owed her or her husband a duty.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold there is no private right of action created, either expressly or implicitly, by the Medicare Act.Â  The trial court properly granted summary judgment to the Doctors on Ms. Woganâ€™s claim for negligence arising from their failures to file Medicare claims and on her claim for breach of third-party beneficiary contract because the claims were an attempt to create a private cause of action where none exists.Â  We find the court properly granted summary judgment on Ms. Woganâ€™s claim for unfair trade practices.Â  Finally, we rule the court did not err in granting Dr. Thomas and his practice summary judgment on the ground Ms. Wogan failed to prove they owed her or her husband a duty to file a claim or to assist her in filing a claim for medicine he did not prescribe.Â  The decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The two remaining Respondents are not involved in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
