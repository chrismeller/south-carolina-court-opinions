Mersereau, of Charleston, Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this adoption case, we hold the execution of a consent to\r\nadopt document must strictly comply with section 63-9-340 of the South Carolina\r\n\nCode (2010). We affirm the family court's determination that the consent\r\ndocument signed by the birth mother was rendered invalid by (1) the failure of the\r\nattorney-witness to be present when the birth mother signed the document and (2)\r\nthe failure of both witnesses to observe the statutorily-required discussion of the\r\nprovisions of the consent to adopt document.1\r\n\r\n      I.     Validity of the Consent to Adopt Document\r\n\r\n\"Adoption exists in this state only by virtue of statutory authority which expressly\r\nprescribes the conditions under which an adoption may legally be effected. Since\r\nthe right of adoption in South Carolina is not a natural right but wholly statutory, it\r\nmust be strictly construed.\" Hucks v. Dolan, 288 S.C. 468, 470, 343 S.E.2d 613,\r\n614 (1986) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nAdoptions are carried out pursuant to the South Carolina Adoption Act. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. §§ 63-9-10 to -2290 (2010 & Supp. 2013). Under the Act, \"Consent or\r\nrelinquishment for the purpose of adoption . . . must be made by a sworn\r\ndocument, signed by the person . . . giving consent or relinquishment . . . .\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 63-9-330(A) (2010). Section 63-9-330(A) sets forth a list of items\r\nthat must be specified in the consent to adopt document. The requirements for\r\nexecuting the document are set forth in section 63-9-340:\r\n\r\n             (A) The sworn document . . . must be signed in the\r\n             presence of two witnesses one of whom must be one of\r\n             the following:\r\n\r\n             (1) a judge of any family court in this State;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We disagree with Lawrence's contention that the underlying order is not\r\nimmediately appealable. The family court's finding that the consent document was\r\ninvalid constitutes a final decision that Brown cannot proceed with the adoption of\r\nthe child. Thus, it is a final order that is immediately appealable. See Terry v.\r\nTerry, 400 S.C. 453, 456-57, 734 S.E.2d 646, 648 (2012) (defining temporary\r\nfamily court orders as \"temporary—they neither decide any issue with finality nor\r\naffect a substantial right . . . .\").\r\n\n            (2) an attorney licensed to practice law in South Carolina\r\n            who does not represent the prospective adoption\r\n            petitioners;\r\n\r\n            (3) a person certified by the State Department of Social\r\n            Services . . . to obtain consents or relinquishments;\r\n\r\n            ....\r\n\r\n            (B) The persons who witness the signing of the sworn\r\n            document . . . shall attach to the document written\r\n            certification signed by each witness that before the\r\n            signing of the document, the provisions of the document\r\n            were discussed with the person giving consent or\r\n            relinquishment, and that based on this discussion, it is\r\n            each witness' opinion that consent or relinquishment is\r\n            being given voluntarily and that it is not being obtained\r\n            under duress or through coercion.\r\n\r\nThe important facts in this appeal are simple. The attorney-witness was not in the\r\nroom when the birth mother, Holly Lawrence, signed the consent document, and\r\nneither witness observed any discussion with Lawrence before Lawrence signed\r\nit.2 The adoptive mother, Jennifer Brown, concedes the execution of the consent\r\ndocument did not strictly comply with section 63-9-340.\r\n\r\nThe plain and mandatory language of section 63-9-340 indicates the legislature\r\nintended strict compliance. Subsection (A) states the document \"must be signed in\r\nthe presence of two witnesses.\" (emphasis added). Subsection (B) states the\r\nwitnesses \"shall\" certify that the provisions of the document were discussed with\r\nthe person giving consent \"before the signing of the document.\" (emphasis added).\r\nThe requirement in subsection (B) of \"certification . . . based on this discussion\"\r\nindicates the witnesses must have personal knowledge of the discussion based on\r\ntheir observation of it.\r\n\r\n2Lawrence was not married when she delivered the child, and we do not address\r\nwhether the biological father's consent was required. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-\r\n310(A)(4), (5) (2010) (setting forth certain requirements that must be met before an\r\nunwed father's consent to adopt is required).\r\n\nOur interpretation of the Act as requiring strict compliance with section 63-9-340\r\nis supported not only by Hucks, but also by the Act itself. Section 63-9-20 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2010) provides, \"The purpose of this article is to establish\r\nfair and reasonable procedures for the adoption of children . . . .\" The legislature\r\nintended that strict compliance with the procedures set forth in section 63-9-340 be\r\nrequired in order to reduce litigation, promote finality, and ensure consent\r\ndocuments are voluntary. See McCann v. Doe, 377 S.C. 373, 390, 660 S.E.2d 500,\r\n509 (2008) (\"[P]rotections need to be in place for both biological and adoptive\r\nparents to ensure the decision to give a child for adoption is a thoughtful and\r\ncertain one and not likely to be challenged in a long, arduous, and emotionally-\r\nwrenching legal process . . . .\"). Because the execution of a consent document\r\nmust strictly comply with section 63-9-340, the consent document is invalid and\r\nthe adoption may not proceed. Therefore, Lawrence could not ratify the invalid\r\nconsent by her subsequent acts.\r\n\r\n      II.    Remaining Issues\r\n\r\nWe decline to determine whether the Rule 62(a), SCRCP, ten-day automatic stay\r\nwas applicable to the family court's order because our order granting supersedeas\r\nrendered that issue moot. See Sloan v. Dep't of Transp., 379 S.C. 160, 167, 666\r\nS.E.2d 236, 240 (2008) (\"This Court will not pass on moot and academic questions\r\nor make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.\" (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted)); Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596\r\n(2001) (\"A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical\r\nlegal effect upon [the] existing controversy.\"). We do not address the best interest\r\nof the child because it is not an issue when the consent document is invalid.\r\nFinally, because we are affirming the family court's order in favor of Lawrence, we\r\ndo not address Brown's request for attorney's fees.\r\n\r\n      III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and WILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5256","title":"Fowler v.

Fowler brought\r\nthis suit against Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\"),\r\nclaiming Nationwide improperly denied his insurance claim. Following a jury\r\n\nverdict in Fowler's favor, Nationwide appealed, arguing the circuit court erred in\r\nadmitting opinion testimony from a non-expert. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 2009, Fowler's home in Oconee County, South Carolina, was\r\ndestroyed by fire. The Friendship Fire Department, a local volunteer fire\r\ndepartment, and its fire chief, David Wright, responded to the emergency call and\r\nwere responsible for putting out the fire at Fowler's home. When Chief Wright\r\narrived at Fowler's home, the fire had already burned through the roof, and a large\r\nbeam had fallen, blocking the front door to the home.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire department extinguished the fire, Chief Wright completed a\r\nstandardized form known as a \"Truck Report.\" According to Chief Wright, state\r\nregulations require fire departments to complete a Truck Report after each fire and\r\nsubmit the form to the State Fire Marshal's office. A Truck Report contains basic\r\ninformation about the fire. Chief Wright testified he followed specific instructions\r\nfrom a manual provided to the fire department when he completed the Truck\r\nReport.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the fire, Fowler had a homeowner's fire insurance policy with\r\nNationwide. After an initial meeting with Fowler, Nationwide decided to conduct\r\nan independent investigation into the cause of the fire. Nationwide hired a\r\ncertified fire investigator to examine the cause and origin of the fire. Nationwide\r\nalso conducted its own investigation into Fowler's financial circumstances at the\r\ntime of his claim. Relying upon the motive and opportunity created by Fowler's\r\nfinancial difficulties at the time of his claim and its fire investigator's finding the\r\nfire was incendiary, Nationwide determined the fire was intentional. Accordingly,\r\nNationwide denied Fowler coverage based upon his policy's intentional acts\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 2009, Fowler brought suit against Nationwide and Andrew Flanagan,\r\nNationwide's local claims adjuster, alleging breach of contract, bad faith of an\r\ninsurance contract, and slander per se. The case was tried before a jury in Oconee\r\nCounty on November 28 through December 2, 2011.\r\n\r\nPrior to the start of trial, Nationwide made a motion in limine to exclude testimony\r\nfrom Chief Wright as to the cause and origin of the fire. Nationwide also objected\r\nto the admission of corresponding portions of the Truck Report containing Chief\r\n\nWright's opinions. Nationwide renewed these objections at trial. Prior to Chief\r\nWright's testimony before the jury, the circuit court allowed both parties to conduct\r\nvoir dire on Chief Wright and heard further arguments on the admissibility of\r\nChief Wright's opinions and the Truck Report. The circuit court ultimately held\r\nChief Wright was not qualified as an expert and therefore could not give opinion\r\ntestimony. However, the circuit court admitted the Truck Report into evidence and\r\nallowed Chief Wright to testify about the report and his rationale in completing it.\r\n\r\nOn the version of the Truck Report admitted at trial, Chief Wright provided the\r\nfollowing information: (1) in the blank for \"Area of Origin,\" Wright wrote \"Living\r\nRoom\"; (2) in the blank for \"Cause of Ignition,\" Wright wrote \"Unintentional\"; and\r\n(3) in the blank for \"Equipment involved in Ignition,\" Wright wrote \"Heater.\"\r\nDuring his testimony, Chief Wright explained his observations of the fire and his\r\nrationale for his entries on the Truck Report. He testified that he indicated the\r\n\"Living Room\" was the area of origin because it was the most heavily damaged\r\narea in the house. He explained that he wrote \"Unintentional\" for the cause of\r\nignition because he did not see or smell anything that made him suspect the use of\r\naccelerants or arson. Finally, Chief Wright explained that he wrote \"Heater\" for\r\nthe equipment involved in ignition because a kerosene heater was at the base of a\r\nV-shaped burn pattern on the wall of the living room. Chief Wright testified that\r\nwhen a fire burns up a wall, it spreads out in the shape of a V, and that the \"V\r\nshape . . . points down to where the fire originated.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of Fowler on the breach of contract and the bad\r\nfaith claims. The jury returned a defense verdict on the slander per se claim. The\r\njury awarded $501,444 for the breach of contract claim and $3,000 for the bad\r\nfaith claim.\r\n\r\nFollowing trial, Nationwide moved for a new trial based in part upon the admission\r\nof improper opinion testimony from Chief Wright, both during his trial testimony\r\nand in the Truck Report. The circuit court denied Nationwide's motion and found\r\nChief Wright's statements at trial were admissible perceptions under Rule 701 of\r\nthe South Carolina Rules of Evidence. Further, the circuit court found the Truck\r\nReport was admissible as a public records exception to hearsay under Rule 803(8)\r\nof the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\nNationwide argues the circuit court erred in failing to grant a new trial based upon\r\nthe improper admission of opinion testimony from Chief Wright. Specifically,\r\nNationwide argues the circuit court erred in admitting the Truck Report and Chief\r\nWright's testimony regarding his rationale for completing the report. Nationwide\r\ncontends this evidence was inadmissible because it contained opinion testimony\r\nChief Wright was not qualified to provide the jury. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The admission of evidence is within the [circuit] court's discretion.\" R & G\r\nConstr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d\r\n113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000). \"The [circuit] court's ruling to admit or exclude\r\nevidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse of discretion amounting to\r\nan error of law.\" Id. \"To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of\r\nevidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting\r\nprejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the jury's verdict was\r\ninfluenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.\" Fields v. Reg'l Med.\r\nCtr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005). \"[T]he admission\r\nof incompetent evidence having some probative value upon a material issue of fact\r\nin the case is ordinarily presumed to be prejudicial.\" Mali v. Odom, 295 S.C. 78,\r\n84, 367 S.E.2d 166, 170 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\nI.   Chief Wright's Testimony at trial\r\n\r\nNationwide argues Chief Wright's testimony regarding the cause of the fire was\r\ninadmissible opinion testimony from a lay witness. We agree.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the circuit court found Chief Wright was not qualified as an expert and\r\ntherefore could not give his opinion on the fire and its origin.1 The circuit court\r\n\r\n1 The issue of whether the circuit court properly chose to not qualify Chief Wright\r\nas an expert is not on appeal, and as a result, we decline to address his qualification\r\nas an expert. See Fields, 363 S.C. at 25, 609 S.E.2d at 509 (\"Qualification of an\r\nexpert and the admission or exclusion of his testimony is a matter within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the [circuit] court.\"). Our holding in this case is not intended to\r\nsuggest volunteer firefighters could not be qualified as expert witnesses if the\r\ncircuit court, in its discretion, finds the \"proffered expert has indeed acquired the\r\nrequisite knowledge and skill to qualify as an expert in the particular subject\r\nmatter.\" Watson v. Ford Motor Co., 389 S.C. 434, 446, 699 S.E.2d 169, 175\r\n(2010).\r\n\nheld Chief Wright could only testify as a lay witness. However, the circuit court\r\nruled the Truck Report was admissible and Chief Wright would be able to testify\r\nabout his entries on the Truck Report. In its order denying Nationwide's motion\r\nfor a new trial, the circuit court found Chief Wright's statements at trial were\r\nadmissible perceptions under Rule 701 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.\r\n\r\nUnder Rule 701,\r\n\r\n             If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness'[s]\r\n             testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited\r\n             to those opinions or inferences which (a) are rationally\r\n             based on the perception of the witness, (b) are helpful to\r\n             a clear understanding of the witness'[s] testimony or the\r\n             determination of a fact in issue, and (c) do not require\r\n             special knowledge, skill, experience or training.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Kelly, our supreme court considered a similar situation in the context of\r\na police officer testifying about the cause of an automobile accident. 285 S.C. 373,\r\n374, 329 S.E.2d 442, 443 (1985). In Kelly, the defendant was convicted in\r\nmagistrate's court of failing to stop at a stop sign, which resulted in an automobile\r\ncollision. Id. at 374, 329 S.E.2d at 442. At trial, the magistrate's court allowed the\r\ninvestigating police officer, without first being qualified as an expert, to draw\r\nconclusions from his direct observations and speculate as to the cause of the\r\naccident. Id. at 374, 329 S.E.2d at 443. Our supreme court held that a police\r\nofficer \"may only testify regarding his direct observations unless . . . qualified as\r\nan expert.\" Id. Because it was \"clear that [the police officer's] testimony was an\r\nopinion\" and \"dealt with the ultimate issues at trial,\" our supreme court reversed\r\nand granted a new trial. Id. at 374-75, 329 S.E.2d at 443.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, we find portions of Chief Wright's testimony were improperly\r\nadmitted opinion testimony. Specifically, we find his testimony regarding the \"V\r\npattern\" as an indicator of the fire's origin2 and his testimony regarding whether the\r\n\r\n2When asked to \"explain to the jury what the V factor or V pattern is,\" Chief\r\nWright stated,\r\n\r\n             Ever since I've been in the fire service, the few times I've\r\n             been around people who do inspections or investigations,\r\n             they call a V pattern, it's a [V] shape that points down to\r\n\nfire was unintentional3 were both opinion testimonies. We disagree with the circuit\r\ncourt that Chief Wright's opinions were permissible perceptions under Rule 701.\r\nThese statements were not mere perceptions observed by Chief Wright, but instead\r\nconstituted opinions that \"require special knowledge, skill, experience or training\"\r\nto properly be made. See Rule 701, SCRE (\"If the witness is not testifying as an\r\nexpert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to\r\nthose opinions or inferences which . . . do not require special knowledge, skill,\r\nexperience or training\"). Accordingly, we find Chief Wright should not have been\r\nallowed to offer his opinions on these issues during his testimony at trial. See\r\nKelly, 285 S.C. at 374, 329 S.E.2d at 443 (finding a lay witness \"may only testify\r\nregarding his direct observations unless . . . qualified as an expert\").\r\n\r\nII. Truck Report\r\n\r\nNationwide argues the circuit court erred in finding the Truck Report was\r\nadmissible as a public records hearsay exception under Rule 803(8) of the South\r\nCarolina Rules of Evidence. Nationwide contends the Truck Report should not\r\nhave been admitted under Rule 803(8) because it contained opinions and\r\nconclusions. We agree.\r\n\r\nHearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at\r\nthe trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"\r\nRule 801(c), SCRE; see also R & G Constr., 343 S.C. at 439, 540 S.E.2d at 121.\r\n\r\n             where the fire originated, and as it comes up a wall, it\r\n             spreads out like V as it comes up.\r\n\r\nWhen later asked why he indicated the \"Heater\" was the \"Equipment involved in\r\nthe Ignition,\" Wright stated, \"I put that there because that was at the bottom of the\r\nV pattern.\"\r\n3 When asked to explain why his report was important, Chief Wright responded,\r\n\"[W]e're supposed to investigate every fire, not like an investigator, but we're\r\nsupposed to look at every fire and determine if we need to call SLED or not.\" He\r\nlater testified he \"didn't see or smell anything that made him think [the fire] was\r\nintentional.\" Finally, when discussing the Truck Report, Chief Wright stated, \"The\r\nnext one says Cause of Ignition, and I've got Unintentional there, because I did not\r\nsee anything that would make it to me. That's just my opinion. I didn't see or\r\nsmell anything, like I said before.\"\r\n\nThe rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out-of-court\r\nstatement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule\r\napplies. See Rule 802, SCRE.\r\n\r\nRule 803(8) provides the following exception to the general hearsay rule,\r\n\r\n             Public Records and Reports. Records, reports,\r\n             statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public\r\n             offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the\r\n             office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to\r\n             duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty\r\n             to report . . . ; provided, however, that investigative notes\r\n             involving opinions, judgments, or conclusions are not\r\n             admissible.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, reports containing opinions, judgments, or conclusions are outside\r\nthe scope of Rule 803(8)'s public records exception. See State v. Morris, 376 S.C.\r\n189, 207, 656 S.E.2d 359, 368-69 (2008) (affirming the exclusion of a bankruptcy\r\nexaminer's report because the report contained \"a great deal of investigative\r\nopinions, legal analysis, and potential conclusions\" that rendered the report\r\n\"outside the scope of the public records and reports exception\"); S.C. Dep't of\r\nMotor Vehicles v. McCarson, 391 S.C. 136, 147 n.11, 705 S.E.2d 425, 430 n.11\r\n(2011) (noting Rule 803(8), SCRE, provides for the admission of certain public\r\nrecords but still excludes \"investigative notes involving opinions, judgments, or\r\nconclusions\").\r\n\r\nWe find Bloomgren v. Fire Insurance Exchange, 517 N.E.2d 290 (Ill. App. Ct.\r\n1987), to be instructive on this issue as the Appellate Court of Illinois addressed an\r\nissue nearly identical to the present case. In Bloomgren, the plaintiffs sought to\r\nintroduce a report prepared by a local firefighter. Id. at 292. This report was\r\ncompleted pursuant to a statutory duty imposed upon local firemen. Id. At trial,\r\nthe firefighter was not qualified as an expert witness. Id. at 293. Further, during\r\ncross-examination, the firefighter admitted he did not have any training in the\r\ninvestigation of fires or their causes and origins. Id. In the report, the firefighter\r\nwrote the \"ignition factor\" was \"electrical\" and the equipment involved in ignition\r\nwas \"fixed wiring.\" Id. The court held this report was not admissible under\r\n\nIllinois's equivalent of Rule 803(8).4 Id. at 294. In support of this conclusion, the\r\ncourt found the report \"clearly contain[ed] an opinion as to the cause of the fire\r\nand, as such, was not admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay\r\nrule unless the author of the report . . . was qualified as an expert to give such an\r\nopinion.\" Id. The court ultimately found \"the fire incident report was erroneously\r\nadmitted\" and after concluding its admission was prejudicial and materially\r\naffected the outcome of trial, the court remanded the case for a new trial. Id. at\r\n294-95.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the instant case are nearly identical to those in Bloomgren. Fowler\r\nsought to introduce the Truck Report, which Chief Wright completed as required\r\nby state regulations. However, the circuit court specifically found Chief Wright\r\nwas not qualified as an expert and could not give opinion testimony. Nevertheless,\r\nthe circuit court admitted a version of the Truck Report that contained the\r\nfollowing information: (1) the fire originated in the living room, (2) the fire was\r\nunintentional, and (3) the heater was the cause of ignition. We find these three\r\nentries constitute opinions or conclusions as to the area of origin, the cause of\r\nignition, and the equipment involved in ignition. See id. at 293 (finding statements\r\nin a firefighter's report stating the \"ignition factor\" was \"electrical\" and the\r\nequipment involved in ignition was \"fixed wiring\" amounted to an opinion as to\r\nthe cause of the fire). Because Chief Wright was not qualified as an expert who\r\nwas capable of forming these opinions, the Truck Report fails to fall under the\r\npublic records exception created by Rule 803(8). See id. at 294 (finding a\r\nfirefighter's report containing opinion is \"not admissible as an exception to the\r\nhearsay rule [under an equivalent to Rule 803(8), SCRE] because [the firefighter]\r\nwas not a qualified expert who was capable of giving an opinion as to the origin of\r\nthe fire\"). Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in admitting the Truck\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n\r\n4Illinois did not adopt a uniform set of Rules of Evidence until 2011. See Il. R.\r\nEvid. Art. I, Refs & Annos. Prior to that time, evidentiary matters were controlled\r\nby case law. Under the controlling case law, public records that \"concern causes\r\nand effects, involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, expressions of\r\nopinion, or the drawing of conclusions are generally not admissible under the\r\npublic records exception; unless they concern matters to which the official would\r\nbe qualified to testify about at trial.\" Bloomgren, 517 N.E.2d at 293 (citing\r\nLombard Park Dist. v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 245 N.E.2d 298, 301-02 (Ill.\r\nApp. Ct. 1969)).\r\n\nIII. Prejudice\r\n\r\nNationwide argues that the improper admission of Chief Wright's testimony and\r\nthe Truck Report prejudiced Nationwide at trial. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe admission of improper evidence is prejudicial if \"there is a reasonable\r\nprobability the jury's verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence.\" Fields,\r\n363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509. \"[T]he admission of incompetent evidence\r\nhaving some probative value upon a material issue of fact in the case is ordinarily\r\npresumed to be prejudicial.\" Mali, 295 S.C. at 84, 367 S.E.2d at 170. In the\r\ninstant case, we find there is a reasonable probability the improper admission of\r\nthe opinion testimony influenced the jury's verdict.\r\n\r\nChief Wright testified that his opinion, formed at the scene, was that the fire was\r\nunintentional and caused by the heater in the living room. This opinion goes to the\r\nultimate issue in this case. During the course of trial, Fowler made repeated\r\nreferences to Chief Wright and his Truck Report. Fowler outlined Chief Wright's\r\ntestimony in his opening statement. Fowler used the Truck Report during his\r\nquestioning of all the expert witnesses testifying at trial. Fowler repeatedly\r\nreferred to Chief Wright and the Truck Report during his closing statement.5\r\n\r\n5 During his closing argument, Fowler repeatedly referred to Chief Wright's\r\ntestimony and the Truck Report as sources of independent information supporting\r\nhis position the fire was unintentional. In the opening remarks of his closing\r\nargument, Fowler mentioned Chief Wright's report on the day of the fire, \"that the\r\nfire started near the [kerosene] heater, and his note that it was unintentional.\" Later\r\nin this argument, Fowler stated,\r\n\r\n             Now Chief David Wright has been attacked as being not\r\n             a competent fire expert. They praised him for being a\r\n             nice guy, which he is a nice guy; they praised him for\r\n             being an experienced firefighter, which is true; but they\r\n             completely disregard and disrespect him as a person with\r\n             any experience to identify and observe what the State\r\n             Marshal requires him to observe.\r\n\r\n             But I suggest if you think about what he said, and look at\r\n             what the evidence in the case is, he has plenty of\r\n             common sense, he has plenty of experience to do his job,\r\n\nUltimately, Fowler inferred the jury should rely upon Chief Wright and the Truck\r\nreport by stating, \"[Chief Wright] has plenty of common sense, he has plenty of\r\nexperience to do his job, plenty of common sense and experience to answer the key\r\nquestion in this case.\"\r\n\r\nWe find a reasonable probability exists that the jury's verdict was influenced by the\r\nadmission of Chief Wright's testimony and the Truck Report. Accordingly, we find\r\nthe circuit court's error in admitting Chief Wright's testimony and the Truck Report\r\nprejudiced Nationwide. See id. (\"[T]he admission of incompetent evidence having\r\nsome probative value upon a material issue of fact in the case is ordinarily\r\npresumed to be prejudicial.\"). Thus, we reverse and remand this case for a new\r\ntrial. See Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509 (\"To warrant reversal based on\r\nthe admission . . . of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling\r\nand the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the jury's\r\nverdict was influenced by the challenged evidence . . . .\").\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the circuit court improperly admitted the Truck\r\nreport and Chief Wright's testimony regarding his rationale in completing this\r\nreport. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this case for a new trial. 6\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              plenty of common sense and experience to answer the\r\n              key question in this case.\r\n6 Nationwide raises the following four additional grounds as error in its appeal: (1)\r\nthe failure to award a setoff for prior payments made on Fowler's behalf; (2) the\r\nfailure to grant a new trial when the jury verdict was excessive and based upon\r\npassion, caprice, or prejudice; (3) the failure to remit the jury verdict; and (4) the\r\nfailure to grant a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV) on Fowler's bad\r\nfaith claim. Due to our disposition of its issue regarding Chief Wright's testimony\r\nand the Truck Report, we do not reach Nationwide's remaining issues on appeal.\r\nSee Futch v.

Appellant challenges his conviction, arguing the trial court erred\r\nin: (1) charging the jury that time is not a material element of committing a lewd\r\nact on a minor; and (2) admitting into evidence a DVD recording of the minor\r\nvictim's two interviews with a forensic examiner. We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDuring the week of Christmas 2007, Victim, who was nine years old, stayed with\r\nher father, a few relatives, and family friends at her uncle's mobile home in Inman,\r\nSouth Carolina. At some point during the week, Appellant and his cousin, Brad,\r\nslept overnight at the mobile home. Victim returned to the home she shared with\r\nher mother and stepfather in early January 2008. Later that month, Victim\r\ndisclosed to her mother that Appellant had touched her inappropriately one night\r\nwhile she was sleeping at the mobile home.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the subsequent police investigation, Victim twice interviewed with\r\nforensic interviewer Wiley Garrett at the Children's Advocacy Center in\r\nSpartanburg, South Carolina. During the first interview, on February 7, 2008,\r\nVictim disclosed that she was sleeping on her uncle's living room floor when she\r\nawoke to find Appellant with his hand down her pants. According to Victim, the\r\nalleged incident occurred \"after my Daddy Jimmy's birthday and Christmas.\"\r\nVictim indicated that at the time of the alleged incident, her cousin, Brittany, who\r\nwas also staying at the mobile home, had recently given birth to a baby boy. At the\r\nsecond interview, on February 14, 2008, Victim made a similar disclosure of\r\nsexual touching. Victim, however, did not identify Brittany as one of the\r\nindividuals present in the mobile home at the time of the alleged incident.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury indicted Appellant on one charge of committing or attempting to\r\ncommit a lewd act upon a child under the age of sixteen.1 The case proceeded to\r\ntrial on April 10-12, 2012. At the start of trial, the trial court held an in camera\r\nhearing to determine the admissibility of a DVD recording of both forensic\r\ninterviews. During the in camera hearing, Garrett provided a detailed description\r\nof his approach to questioning a child who may have been sexually abused.\r\nFollowing Garrett's testimony, the recording was played for the court. Defense\r\ncounsel objected to the admission of the recording on the ground that it would\r\nbolster Victim's testimony. The trial court determined the recording was\r\nadmissible under section 17-23-175 of the South Carolina Code (2003), which\r\nallows the admission of out-of-court statements by a child under the age of twelve\r\nwhen certain requirements are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Appellant was indicted pursuant to section 16-15-140 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2003), which was repealed on June 18, 2012 by 2012 Act No. 255 § 14.\r\n\nVictim, who was thirteen years old at the time of trial, testified in detail concerning\r\nthe alleged incident. She asserted the alleged incident occurred on December 29,\r\n2007. When questioned by the solicitor how she knew the exact date, Victim\r\nreplied that the alleged incident happened \"a day or two before\" her father's\r\nbirthday on December 31. Victim identified several people who were present at\r\nthe mobile home on the night of the alleged incident. She stated: \"It was me, [my\r\nuncle] Bryan, [my cousin] Bryanne, my dad, my Nana, my dad's girlfriend, and\r\n[my cousin] Paul.\"\r\n\r\nVictim's mother, Stacy Gregory, testified Victim had a scheduled visitation with\r\nher father during the week of Christmas 2007. Gregory stated she picked Victim\r\nup from the mobile home sometime around New Year's Day 2008. According to\r\nGregory, on January 29, 2008, Victim disclosed to her that Appellant had\r\ninappropriately touched her.\r\n\r\nThe State also presented the testimony of Wiley Garrett, who was qualified as an\r\nexpert in forensic interviewing. Garrett testified he conducted two fact-finding\r\ninterviews with Victim and one joint interview with Victim's mother and\r\nstepfather. The trial court admitted into evidence the DVD recording of Garrett's\r\ntwo forensic interviews with Victim, which was played for the jury. On cross-\r\nexamination, Garrett confirmed that during one of the interviews Victim told him\r\n\"Brittany that . . . just had a baby\" was present in the mobile home on the night of\r\nthe alleged incident.\r\n\r\nAppellant testified he stayed at the mobile home \"only once.\" Although Appellant\r\ncould not recall the exact date he spent the night at the mobile home, he indicated it\r\nwas a few days after Brittany delivered her baby. Appellant admitted that he had\r\nabout four or five beers that night; however, he denied he was drunk. Appellant\r\nadamantly denied touching Victim inappropriately.\r\n\r\nAppellant's cousin, Elizabeth Blackwell, testified she was in a relationship with\r\nVictim's uncle and had previously invited Appellant to stay at the mobile home.\r\nAccording to Blackwell, Victim and Appellant were present in the mobile home at\r\nthe same time on only one occasion. Blackwell claimed that on this occasion her\r\ndaughter, Brittany Fowler, was also present in the mobile home, along with\r\nBrittany's then-newborn son. Blackwell indicated her grandson was born in early\r\nJanuary 2008. Brittany Fowler corroborated Blackwell's testimony regarding the\r\ntimeframe. Additionally, Fowler presented her son's birth certificate, which was\r\nadmitted into evidence.\r\n\nAfter the completion of testimony, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict,\r\narguing that it was impossible for the incident to have occurred on either of the\r\ndates listed on the indictment.2 Specifically, defense counsel pointed to the fact\r\nthat Brittany Fowler's son was born in early January 2008. The State countered\r\nthat the only contradictory evidence concerned whether Appellant touched Victim.\r\nAdditionally, the State argued the case did not involve a time-specific incident. In\r\nresponse, defense counsel noted that Victim stated in one of the forensic interviews\r\nthat Brittany had already had her baby at the time of the alleged incident. The trial\r\ncourt denied defense counsel's motion, reasoning the timing issue went to Victim's\r\ncredibility.\r\n\r\nDuring the charge conference, the State requested the trial court instruct the jury\r\nthat time is not a material element of the offense of committing a lewd act with a\r\nminor. Defense counsel objected to the requested instruction, and engaged in the\r\nfollowing colloquy with the trial court:\r\n\r\n             Mr. Hall: [W]e have a specific date alleged. They\r\n             presented it several times. The child testified, if I'm not\r\n             mistaken, that it occurred the weekend before my daddy's\r\n             birthday. Daddy's birthday was [December 31st]. Very\r\n             specific and I think to do that is giving, carving out\r\n             another special consideration for a child victim that cuts\r\n             in the rights of my client. So, Your Honor, I would\r\n             oppose that.\r\n\r\n             The Court: I will charge it, but you know that the other\r\n             interesting wrinkle about this particular issue is that the\r\n             mother, Mrs. Gregory, testified that she picked up,\r\n             [Victim], on New Year[']s Day. So --.\r\n\r\n             Mr. Hall: That -- picked [Victim] up, yes, sir.\r\n\r\n             The Court: Right. Which is before Brittany had her\r\n             baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n2The indictment listed the lewd conduct as occurring \"between the dates of\"\r\nDecember 29 and December 30, 2007.\r\n\n             Mr. Hall: This - - yes, sir, that's another thing that I\r\n             believe, on my side, is physically impossible for it to\r\n             have happened beforehand, yes, sir.\r\n\r\n             The Court: Well, that's your argument to the jury.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the trial court gave the requested instruction. The trial court also\r\ncharged the jury on its duty to consider the credibility and believability of the\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nThe jury ultimately found Appellant guilty of committing a lewd act on a minor.\r\nDefense counsel moved for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion and\r\nsentenced Appellant to five years' imprisonment, suspended on the service of three\r\nyears' probation. The trial court also required Appellant to enroll in the registry of\r\nchild abuse and neglect, and to enroll in sex offender counseling. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n1. Did the trial court err in charging the jury that time is not a material element of\r\ncommitting a lewd act on a minor?\r\n\r\n2. Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence a DVD recording of Victim's\r\ntwo interviews with the forensic examiner?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Jury Charge\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in charging the jury that time is not a\r\nmaterial element of the offense of committing a lewd act on a minor because he\r\ncentered his defense strategy on attacking inconsistencies in the evidence regarding\r\nthe timing of the alleged incident. He further argues the charge was \"gratuitous\"\r\nand \"unfairly prejudicial.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"'In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the court's jury charge as a\r\nwhole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.'\" State v. Mattison, 388\r\nS.C. 469, 478, 697 S.E.2d 578, 583 (2010) (quoting State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312,\r\n318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 2003)). \"'A jury charge is correct if, when the\r\n\ncharge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers\r\nthe law.'\" Id. (quoting Adkins, 353 S.C. at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 464). \"A jury charge\r\nthat is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\"The trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South\r\nCarolina.\" Id. at 479, 697 S.E.2d at 583. \"'The law to be charged must be\r\ndetermined from the evidence presented at trial.'\" Id. (quoting State v. Knoten, 347\r\nS.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001)). \"'A request to charge a correct\r\nstatement of the law on an issue raised by the indictment and the evidence\r\npresented at trial should not be refused.'\" Id. (quoting State v. Austin, 299 S.C.\r\n456, 458, 385 S.E.2d 830, 831 (1989)).\r\n\r\nIn support of his argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that time\r\nis not a material element of committing a lewd act on a minor, Appellant cites to\r\nState v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 541 S.E.2d 813 (2001). The trial court in Jones\r\nindicated during a charge conference that it would charge the jury that reasonable\r\ndoubt meant a doubt which would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act. 343\r\nS.C. at 576, 541 S.E.2d at 820. Defense counsel specifically incorporated the\r\n\"hesitate to act\" language in his closing argument, telling the jury that \"when you\r\ngo through this testimony and this evidence in this case, you're gonna hesitate.\" Id.\r\nat 576–77, 541 S.E.2d at 820–21. The trial court subsequently, upon request from\r\nthe solicitor, removed the \"hesitate to act\" language from the jury charge. Id. at\r\n577, 541 S.E.2d at 821. On appeal, our supreme court found: \"Appellant\r\nreasonably relied upon the judge's representation that he intended to give that\r\ncharge to the jury. The decision to alter the charge, after the argument, was\r\nfundamentally unfair.\" Id. at 578, 541 S.E.2d at 821 (emphases added). Thus,\r\nJones requires a defendant to reasonably rely on the trial court's ruling to his or her\r\ndetriment in order for a subsequent change to impact the fundamental fairness of\r\nthe defendant's trial.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court made its ruling at the charge conference before\r\nclosing arguments. Appellant does not contend his strategy of pointing out the\r\ninconsistent evidence concerning the timing of the alleged offense was made in\r\nreliance on any prior ruling by the trial court. Because Appellant does not argue\r\nthat an altered ruling impaired his trial strategy, we find Appellant's reliance on\r\nJones is misplaced.\r\n\nAdditionally, we find the trial court's charge adequately covered the law and was\r\nconsistent with our existing jurisprudence. The crime of committing or attempting\r\na lewd act on a minor is set forth in section 16-15-140 as follows:\r\n\r\n             It is unlawful for a person over the age of fourteen years\r\n             to willfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd or\r\n             lascivious act upon or with the body, or its parts, of a\r\n             child under the age of sixteen years, with the intent of\r\n             arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions\r\n             or sexual desires of the person or of the child.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Tumbleston, 376 S.C. 90, 100–01, 654 S.E.2d 849, 854–55 (Ct. App.\r\n2007), this court interpreted section 16-15-140 as a part of its evaluation of the\r\nsufficiency of an indictment charging the defendant with committing a lewd act\r\nupon a minor. The appellant argued the indictment was insufficient because it did\r\nnot allege the specific time of the offense charged. Id. at 94, 654 S.E.2d at 851. In\r\nreviewing the indictment, the Tumbleston court noted that where an indictment\r\nallegedly includes an overbroad period, the court must examine whether time is a\r\nmaterial element of the offense. Id. at 98, 654 S.E.2d at 853. Consequently, as a\r\npart of its analysis, the Tumbleston court interpreted section 16-15-140 and\r\nconcluded \"[t]ime is not a material element of . . . committing a lewd act on a\r\nminor.\" Id. at 101, 654 S.E.2d at 855. Thus, the Tumbleston court recognized\r\nsection 16-15-140 does not have a specificity requirement as to the timing of the\r\noffense of committing a lewd act on a minor.3 See United States v. Stuckey, 220\r\n\r\n3The absence of a specificity requirement in section 16-15-140 is consistent with\r\nour legislature's recognition of the special nature of sexual offenses. State v.\r\nRayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 117, 631 S.E.2d 244, 250 (2006) (\"In enacting [section 16-\r\n3-657, which provides the testimony of a victim need not be corroborated in\r\ncriminal sexual conduct cases], the Legislature recognized that crimes involving\r\ncriminal sexual conduct fall within a unique category of offenses against the\r\nperson. In many cases, the only witnesses to a rape or sexual assault are the\r\nperpetrator and the victim. An investigation may or may not reveal physical or\r\nforensic evidence identifying a particular perpetrator.\"). Where the victim is a\r\nchild, such cases often involve continued offenses over an extended period of time\r\nor, as in this case, are not reported until sometime after their commission. Thus, a\r\nspecificity requirement would serve to prevent many prosecutions in child sexual\r\nabuse cases.\r\n\nF.3d 976, 982 (8th Cir. 2000) (\"Time is not a material element of a criminal\r\noffense unless made so by the statute creating the offense.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nThe dissent correctly notes that Tumbleston is distinguishable from the instant case\r\nbecause it focused solely on the issue of the sufficiency of an indictment.\r\nHowever, the Tumbleston court's interpretation of section 16-15-140 is pertinent to\r\nthe instant matter because the determination of whether a jury charge is proper\r\ncenters on whether the charge, read as a whole, \"contains the correct definition and\r\nadequately covers the law.\" Mattison, 388 S.C. at 478, 697 S.E2d at 583 (\"A jury\r\ncharge that is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.\").\r\n\r\nWe further note the charge given in the instant case is consistent with the decision\r\nin State v. Anderson, 59 S.C. 229, 37 S.E. 820 (1901), which upheld an analogous\r\ncharge in a case involving larceny. Therein, the trial court charged the jury:\r\n\r\n             Time is not what we term of the essence of a crime when\r\n             a theft or other criminal offense is said to have been\r\n             committed at a certain time. The gist of the charge does\r\n             not consist in proving that it was done at the exact time\r\n             laid in the indictment. The gist is whether or not the\r\n             crime as alleged was committed, and, if the state proves\r\n             that it was committed at any time, -the particular charge\r\n             contained in the indictment prior to the finding of the true\r\n             bill, -that would be sufficient; but the state must prove\r\n             the charge as contained in the indictment. It is not\r\n             necessary, and the state is not required, to prove the exact\r\n             time laid in the indictment; but, still, it must prove that\r\n             substantial charge as having been committed at some\r\n             date, certainly before the finding of the true bill.\r\n\r\nId. at 232, 37 S.E. at 821. In upholding the charge, the Anderson court reasoned\r\nthe trial court's instruction was appropriate because South Carolina does not\r\nrequire the State to prove the exact time of the offense where it is not a material\r\nelement of the crime. Id. The same is true in the instant case, as Tumbleston\r\nestablished that time is not a material element of committing a lewd act on a minor.\r\nSee 376 S.C. at 101, 654 S.E.2d at 855.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Anderson, our more recent jurisprudence addressing jury charges in\r\ncases involving child sex crimes suggests the charge in the instant case was not\r\n\nerroneous. In State v. Rayfield, the defendant was charged with three counts of\r\ncriminal sexual conduct with a minor in violation of section 16-3-655 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2003). 369 S.C. 106, 115, 631 S.E.2d 244, 249 (2006). The trial\r\ncourt charged the jury the contents of a related statute, section 16-3-657, which\r\nprovides \"[t]he testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in prosecutions\r\nunder §§ 16-3-652 through 16-3-658.\" Id. On appeal, our supreme court\r\nrecognized, \"It is not always necessary, of course, to charge the contents of a\r\ncurrent statute.\" Id. at 117, 631 S.E.2d at 250. Nevertheless, the court held the\r\ninstruction did not constitute prejudicial error because \"the charge as a whole\r\ncomport[ed] with the law.\" Id. at 118, 631 S.E.d at 250. In so holding, the court\r\nemphasized that along with charging the jury the contents of the statute, the trial\r\njudge \"thoroughly instructed [the jury] on the State's burden of proof and the jury's\r\nduty to find the facts and judge the credibility of witnesses.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn the instant matter, it was not required that the trial court charge the jury time is\r\nnot a material element of committing a lewd act on a minor. However, as in\r\nRayfield, this instruction did not constitute reversible error as the charge as a whole\r\ncomported with the law. The trial court instructed the jury as to the contents of\r\nsection 16-15-140 along with the State's burden to prove the charges in indictment\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the jury was adequately advised of the essential\r\nelements of the offense that had to be proven. Moreover, similar to Rayfield, the\r\ntrial court in the instant matter instructed the jury on its duty to consider the\r\ncredibility of the witness testimony. With regard to credibility, the trial court\r\ncharged the jury:\r\n\r\n             You're not to infer from anything I have said or done or\r\n             anything I now say or do as indicating an opinion of mine\r\n             on the facts. Our law does not allow a trial judge to\r\n             formulate or express to a jury an opinion on the facts. It's\r\n             simply, solely up to you to examine the evidence and to\r\n             give to the evidence the effect, the value, the weight, and\r\n             the truth you believe it should have.\r\n\r\n             In doing this, you may believe one witness as opposed to\r\n             several, several witnesses as opposed to one. You may\r\n             believe all, part, or none of a witness'[s] testimony. In\r\n             analyzing the evidence, use your common sense, your\r\n             sense of logic, your sense of reasoning, and your\r\n             experiences in life.\r\n\n             As judges of the facts, you must necessarily judge the\r\n             credibility, that is the believability, of the witnesses who\r\n             have testified. In assessing credibility, use the things I\r\n             just talked about. Use the things that you find in your\r\n             day-to-day life as being indicative of truthfulness in an,\r\n             in an individual, and you can use certain evaluators, a\r\n             witness'[s] demeanor, how they act on the stand, are they\r\n             hesitant or straightforward, is their testimony consistent\r\n             or inconsistent. Consider the opportunity a witness had\r\n             to know things to which the witness testified to.\r\n\r\n             You can consider any bias or prejudice a witness may\r\n             have. That is, a witness would wish to help or hurt one\r\n             side or the other, and you can consider whether or not\r\n             someone has a criminal record in regard to their\r\n             believability.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the charge on credibility, the trial court separately instructed the jury\r\nas to its duty to assess the believability of a child witness. In its charge, the trial\r\ncourt explained that when a witness is a child \"you must determine, as with any\r\nwitness, whether the testimony is believable.\" The court further instructed the jury\r\n\"but as to a child, you may also consider the [child's] age, the child's ability to\r\nobserve and remember the facts, [and] the child's ability to understand and answer\r\nquestions.\"\r\n\r\nThe dissent argues the circumstances of this case made it improper for the trial\r\ncourt to charge the jury that time is not a material element of the crime of\r\ncommitting a lewd act on a minor. The dissent's argument mirrors the arguments\r\nin Justice Pleicones' dissenting opinion in Rayfield. In fact, the dissent cites to the\r\nRayfield dissent for the proposition that it is not always appropriate for the trial\r\ncourt to charge a correct point of law to the jury. See 369 S.C. at 119, 631 S.E.2d\r\nat 251 (Pleicones, J., dissenting) (\"Some principles of law, however, are not to be\r\ncharged to a jury.\").\r\n\r\nWe recognize some principles of law should not always be charged to the jury.\r\nHowever, our supreme court has made clear in at least two instances when a\r\nprinciple of law is not the proper subject of a jury charge. See State v. Grant, 275\r\nS.C. 404, 408, 272 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (holding that it is improper for the trial\r\n\njudge to instruct the jury on the law of flight); State v. Hammond, 270 S.C. 347,\r\n356, 242 S.E.2d 411, 416 (1978) (holding that although it is always proper for an\r\nattorney in argument to the jury to point out the failure of a party to call a material\r\nwitness, \"such a charge has no proper place in the judge's statement of the law\").\r\nTo date, the supreme court has not enunciated the \"time is not a material element\"\r\ninstruction is erroneous. In fact, in State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 508, 435\r\nS.E.2d 859, 863 (1993), the court found the trial court's charge including the\r\nlanguage \"time is not a material element of a sexual assault involving a child\" did\r\nnot prejudice the defendant.\r\n\r\nBased on the determination in Schumpert, we believe a precedential inference can\r\nbe drawn that the jury charge in the instant case was not prejudicial. In Schumpert,\r\nthe indictment alleged the defendant raped the minor victim on one occasion\r\nbetween April 13 and May 18, 1990. Id. at 507, 435 S.E.2d at 862. At trial,\r\nhowever, the victim testified the rape occurred on either Saturday, April 14 or\r\nSaturday, April 21. Id. The trial court charged the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n             The State is not required to prove that the offense\r\n             occurred on any exact day between the alleged period of\r\n             time. But the state is required to prove that the alleged\r\n             offense did occur sometime during the period of April the\r\n             13th, 1990 and May the 18th, 1990. I charge you that\r\n             time is not a material element of a sexual assault\r\n             involving a child.\r\n\r\nId. at 508, 435 S.E.2d at 862–863 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the defendant challenged the jury charge, arguing \"where the State's\r\nown proof narrowed the time frame to two Saturdays in April, it was prejudicial to\r\nhis plea of alibi to allow the jury to find that the offense occurred any time during\r\nthe time alleged in the indictment.\" Id. at 508, 435 S.E.2d at 863. The Schumpert\r\ncourt found that the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's charge\r\nregarding the time of the offense. Id. In reaching this conclusion, the court\r\nreasoned: \"Despite the charge allowing the jury to consider a larger time period\r\nthan that introduced into evidence by the State, appellant produced alibi evidence\r\nfor every weekend during the entire time period charged.\" Id.\r\n\r\nGiven the court's reasoning in Schumpert, we are not convinced the trial court's\r\ncharge in the instant matter was prejudicial to Appellant's strategy of highlighting\r\n\ninconsistencies in Victim's statements concerning the time of the alleged incident.\r\nAt trial, Appellant's defense counsel ably argued these inconsistencies to the jury.\r\nIn particular, defense counsel noted that Brittany's son, who Victim initially\r\nclaimed was born just before the time of the alleged incident, was in fact born in\r\nJanuary 2008. Defense counsel further contradicted Victim's testimony by offering\r\ntestimony from Appellant and his cousin, Blackwell. This testimony indicated\r\nAppellant visited the mobile home only once and that the visit took place after\r\nBrittany had her baby. Moreover, Victim's mother, who was the State's witness,\r\ntestified she picked Victim up from the mobile home sometime around January 1,\r\n2008, which contradicted Victim's testimony and was consistent with the timeline\r\noffered by the defense. Although the trial court instructed the jury that time is not\r\na material element of the offense, defense counsel proceeded with his strategy and\r\npresented a defense of factual impossibility. Cf. Schumpert, 312 S.C. at 508, 435\r\nS.E.2d at 863 (holding appellant was not prejudiced by charge including the\r\nlanguage \"time is not a material element of sexual assault involving a child\" and\r\nallowing the jury to consider a larger time period than that introduced into\r\nevidence by the State because \"appellant produced alibi evidence for every\r\nweekend during the entire time period charged\"). Accordingly, we find no\r\nprejudice in this case from the charge given.\r\n\r\nII. Admission of Forensic Interviews\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in admitting the DVD recording of Victim's\r\ninterviews with the forensic examiner. He contends the content of the recording\r\nconstituted a prior consistent statement that improperly bolstered Victim's\r\ntestimony. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Generally, a prior consistent statement is not admissible unless the witness is\r\ncharged with recent fabrication or improper motive or influence.\" State v. Russell,\r\n383 S.C. 447, 450, 679 S.E.2d 542, 543–44 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B), SCRE). However, section 17-23-175 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2014) permits the admission of out-of-court statements by a child under the age of\r\ntwelve when the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n         (1) the statement was given in response to questioning\r\n            conducted during an investigative interview of the child;\r\n\n         (2) an audio and visual recording of the statement is\r\n            preserved on film, videotape, or other electronic means . .\r\n            .;\r\n\r\n         (3) the child testifies at the proceeding and is subject to\r\n            cross- examination [sic] on the elements of the offense\r\n            and the making of the out-of-court statement; and\r\n\r\n         (4) the court finds, in a hearing conducted outside the\r\n            presence of the jury, that the totality of the circumstances\r\n            surrounding the making of the statement provides\r\n            particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nThus, the legislature has made \"specific allowances\" for the admission of out-of-\r\ncourt statements by child victims in criminal sexual conduct cases when the\r\nrequirements of section 17-23-175 are satisfied. State v. Whitner, 399 S.C. 547,\r\n558–59, 732 S.E.2d 861, 867 (2012).\r\n\r\nAppellant acknowledges that section 17-23-175 has been held by our supreme\r\ncourt to be a valid legislative enactment.4 However, he contends it is still\r\nimpermissible to offer testimony bolstering that of an alleged child victim. In\r\nessence, Appellant argues that even though Whitner permits the admission of a\r\nchild victim's out-of-court statements, such statements are only admissible if they\r\ndo not bolster the credibility of the child witness.\r\n\r\nIn Whitner, the appellant challenged the admission of the victim's forensic\r\ninterview videotape, arguing \"it was cumulative repetition of the minor victim's\r\ntestimony at trial and improper bolstering.\" 399 S.C. at 558, 732 S.E.2d at 867.\r\nThe contents of the interview were similar to the underlying allegations the victim\r\nfirst disclosed to her mother, as well as the testimony given by the victim at trial.\r\nId. at 551–52, 732 S.E.2d at 863. In spite of the similarities between the victim's\r\nout-of-court statements and the victim's trial testimony, the court noted \"the\r\nforensic interview of the child and mere foundational trial testimony of the\r\ninterviewer serve as a model of how the statute is designed to work.\" Id. at 559,\r\n\r\n4See Whitner, 399 S.C. at 559, 732 S.E.2d at 867 (holding section 17-23-175 is a\r\nvalid legislative enactment); id. (recognizing the South Carolina Rules of Evidence\r\nallow the legislature to enact evidentiary rules so long as such an enactment does\r\nnot violate the state or federal constitutions).\r\n\n732 S.E.2d at 867 (emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the court\r\nemphasized \"the forensic interviewer did not improperly lead or influence the\r\nvictim in any way, and the victim answered the questions on her own accord.\" Id.\r\nThe court further noted, \"the forensic interviewer's testimony was for the limited\r\npurpose of laying the proper foundation for the admission of the videotape.\" Id.\r\nConsequently, the court concluded that there was no error in the admission of the\r\nforensic interview into evidence. Id. at 559–60, 732 S.E.2d at 867.\r\n\r\nHere, the trial court found the DVD recording of Victim's two forensic interviews\r\nmet the requirements of section 17-23-175, noting:\r\n\r\n             The statements were not elicited by leading questions.\r\n             There was one question that was a little toward[s]\r\n             leading, but it was not answered and another question\r\n             was asked, and - - but I only remember one being\r\n             somewhat suggestive of an answer. But, in fact, it was\r\n             not answered and there were no other, by my viewing of\r\n             it, any other leading questions, and, again, that one was\r\n             not answered. Another question was asked.\r\n\r\nAppellant does not challenge the trial court's ruling that the statutory conditions\r\nrequired for admission of the recording were satisfied. See Whitner, 399 S.C. at\r\n565, 732 S.E.2d at 870 (Pleicones, J., concurring) (\"[T]here is no basis for an\r\nimproper bolstering argument when [a child victim's] prior testimony is admitted\r\npursuant to § 17-23-175.\"). Furthermore, as in Whitner, the forensic examiner\r\nnever stated he believed Victim, and he gave no indication regarding Victim's\r\ncredibility. Instead, the forensic interviewer offered testimony for the sole purpose\r\nof laying the proper foundation for the admission of the recording. Accordingly,\r\nwe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the recording of\r\nVictim's forensic interviews into evidence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellant's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring in part, and dissenting in part: I concur with the result\r\nreached by the majority as to the admissibility of the forensic interviews. I\r\n\ndisagree, however, that the jury charge—\"time is not a material element of the\r\noffense of criminal sexual conduct with a minor\"—was proper in this case.\r\nBecause I would find giving this charge was error that prejudiced Perry, I would\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\n      I.     The \"Improper Bolstering\" Objection\r\n\r\nI first address the admissibility of the forensic interviews because my discussion of\r\nthat issue sets the stage for my explanation of why the jury charge was improper\r\nand prejudiced Perry.\r\n\r\nPerry objected to the admissibility of the forensic interviews on the basis that the\r\ninterviews \"improperly bolstered\" the victim's testimony. However, an objection\r\non the basis of improper bolstering is not a valid objection unless it is based on a\r\nspecific rule of evidence, which Perry's objection was not. Similarly, Perry's\r\nargument on appeal that the interviews \"impermissibly bolstered [the victim's]\r\ntestimony\" is of no legal consequence. As a result, Perry presented no valid issue\r\nfor this court to address regarding the admissibility of the forensic interviews.\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"bolstering\" relates to the capacity of testimony or evidence to\r\nmake other testimony or evidence more credible. Evidence that bolsters other\r\nevidence is generally relevant because it makes the existence of disputed facts\r\nmore probable by enhancing the credibility of the evidence that proves those facts.\r\nSee Rule 401, SCRE (\"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to\r\nmake the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\r\naction more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"). In\r\nthis case, the forensic interviews are relevant for the additional reason that they\r\ncontain the victim's statements about what happened to her and who committed the\r\ncrime. Under Rule 402, SCRE, \"All relevant evidence is admissible, except as\r\notherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the\r\nState of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, or by other rules promulgated by the\r\nSupreme Court of South Carolina.\" As with any relevant evidence, therefore, a\r\ntrial court may not exclude evidence that bolsters other evidence unless the\r\nexclusion is \"provided\" for by some constitutional, statutory, or rule-based\r\nprinciple of law.\r\n\r\nHistorically, trial courts have excluded evidence that bolsters other evidence in two\r\nprimary circumstances. First, witnesses \"may not offer an opinion regarding the\r\ncredibility of others.\" State v. Kromah, 401 S.C. 340, 358, 737 S.E.2d 490, 499\r\n\n(2013). In State v. Taylor, 404 S.C. 506, 745 S.E.2d 124 (Ct. App. 2013), we\r\nexplained this basis for excluding evidence that bolsters: \"the prohibition against\r\nbolstering is for the purpose of preventing a witness from testifying whether\r\nanother witness is telling the truth,\" and \"[i]mproper bolstering occurs when\r\na[] . . . witness is allowed to give his or her opinion as to whether the complaining\r\nwitness is telling the truth.\" 404 S.C. at 514, 745 S.E.2d at 128 (emphasis added);\r\naccord State v. Whitner, 399 S.C. 547, 559, 732 S.E.2d 861, 867 (2012)\r\n(describing bolstering testimony as \"to have the forensic interviewer, improperly\r\nimbued with the imprimatur of an expert witness, invade the province of the jury\r\nby vouching for the credibility of the alleged victim\"); see also James F. Dreher, A\r\nGuide to Evidence Law in South Carolina 21 (S.C. Bar 1967) (\"The general rule is\r\nthat unless the credibility of your witness has been attacked, you may not offer\r\nproof that his credibility is good.\"). In State v. McKerley, 397 S.C. 461, 725\r\nS.E.2d 139 (Ct. App. 2012), we explained that this basis for excluding evidence for\r\nits bolstering effect is now \"incorporated into Rule 608(a) of the South Carolina\r\nRules of Evidence.\" 397 S.C. at 464, 725 S.E.2d at 141; see also Rule 608(a),\r\nSCRE (\"The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in\r\nthe form of opinion or reputation, but subject to [two] limitations . . . .\").\r\n\r\nThe second circumstance in which courts have excluded evidence that bolsters is\r\nwhen a party offers an out-of-court statement—consistent with a witness's\r\ntestimony—before the witness is impeached. See State v. Barrett, 299 S.C. 485,\r\n486-87, 386 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1989) (stating \"when a witness has not been\r\nimpeached, evidence of prior consistent statements is inadmissible\" and calling the\r\nviolation of this principle \"improper bolstering\"). This basis for excluding\r\nevidence for its bolstering effect is now incorporated into Rule 802, SCRE—the\r\nrule against hearsay—and the non-hearsay provisions of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) and\r\n(D), SCRE. See Whitner, 399 S.C. at 558, 732 S.E.2d at 867 (citing Rule 801(d)(1)\r\nfor the proposition that \"a prior consistent statement is not admissible unless the\r\nwitness is charged with fabrication or improper motive or bias\").\r\n\r\nUnder the Rules of Evidence, therefore, the bases on which a trial court may\r\nexclude evidence that bolsters other evidence include Rule 608(a) and Rule 802.\r\nConceivably, a trial court could exclude evidence for its bolstering effect under\r\nRule 403, which provides, \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by\" considerations listed in the rule.5\r\n\r\n5 See United States v. Bermudez, 529 F.3d 158, 165-71 (2d Cir. 2008) (Underhill,\r\nJ., dissenting) (arguing Rule 403 permits the exclusion of evidence that bolsters\r\n\nOther than these rules, however, there is no provision under modern evidence law\r\nto exclude relevant evidence on the basis of improper bolstering. Thus, neither\r\nPerry's objection to the trial court nor his argument to this court that the forensic\r\ninterviews constituted improper bolstering has any legal import. They are based on\r\nan invalid argument under our Rules of Evidence.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the trial court admitted the forensic interviews pursuant to section 17-\r\n23-175 of the South Carolina Code (2014). This statute reflects our General\r\nAssembly's recognition that the central issue in the trial of almost any sexual\r\nassault case involving a child—certainly this one—is whether the victim's\r\ntestimony is truthful and accurate.6 It represents our General Assembly's policy\r\ndetermination that a forensic interview should be admissible to enhance the\r\ncredibility of a child sexual assault victim's trial testimony—bolster—if it meets\r\nthe criteria of the statute. Under section 17-23-175 and the policy underlying it,\r\ntherefore, the tendency of a forensic interview to enhance the credibility of the\r\nvictim's testimony is precisely the reason that admission of the interview is proper.\r\n\r\nThus, Perry's objection to the forensic interviews on the basis of improper\r\nbolstering and his similar argument on appeal are invalid. They are not only\r\nineffective under the Rules of Evidence, but inconsistent with section 17-23-175,\r\nwhich specifically provides for the admission of these forensic interviews for the\r\nvery reason Perry contends admission was improper—the interviews bolstered the\r\ncredibility of the victim.\r\n\r\n      II.    The Jury Charge\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the importance of the victim's credibility also made it improper for\r\nthe trial court to charge the jury as it did. Although it is true \"time is not a material\r\nelement\" of the crime of lewd act on a minor, the fact that it is a correct point of\r\n\r\nother evidence). But see Westfield Ins. Co. v. Harris, 134 F.3d 608, 613 (4th Cir.\r\n1998) (finding the district court abused its discretion by excluding bolstering\r\nevidence under Rule 403).\r\n6 Section 17-23-175 applies more broadly than just to child sexual assault cases,\r\nand thus also represents a broader general recognition of the challenges courts face\r\nin dealing with the credibility of children. See § 17-23-175(A) (providing the\r\nsection applies \"[i]n a general sessions court proceeding or a delinquency\r\nproceeding in family court\").\r\n\nlaw does not make it proper for the trial court to charge it to the jury. Compare\r\nState v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 117, 631 S.E.2d 244, 250 (2006) (\"It is not always\r\nnecessary, of course, to charge [a particular point of law].\"), with 369 S.C. at 119,\r\n631 S.E.2d at 251 (Pleicones, J., dissenting) (\"Some principles of law, however,\r\nare not to be charged to a jury.\").\r\n\r\nThe primary case upon which the majority relies for the correctness of the\r\ncharge—State v. Tumbleston, 376 S.C. 90, 654 S.E.2d 849 (Ct. App. 2007)—has\r\nnothing to do with a jury charge. There were two issues on appeal in Tumbleston:\r\n(1) whether the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion for a directed\r\nverdict, 376 S.C. at 102, 654 S.E.2d at 855, and (2) whether \"the trial court erred in\r\ndenying [the defendant's] motion to quash the indictments.\" 376 S.C. at 94, 654\r\nS.E.2d at 851. As to the second issue, the defendant argued \"the indictments did\r\nnot allege the specific time of each offense intended to be charged, and thus, failed\r\nto provide him with adequate notice to prepare a defense.\" 376 S.C. at 92, 654\r\nS.E.2d at 850. Therefore, our statement in Tumbleston, \"Time is not a material\r\nelement of . . . lewd act on a minor,\" 376 S.C. at 101, 654 S.E.2d at 855, related\r\nonly to whether the indictment sufficiently put the defendant on notice of the\r\ncharges against him. We stated:\r\n\r\n             We reject the notion that a specified time period\r\n             prevented [the defendant] from adequately preparing his\r\n             defense to the charges. Reading the indictments\r\n             objectively from a reasonable person's view, we conclude\r\n             they contain the necessary elements of the offenses\r\n             charged and sufficiently apprise [the defendant] that he\r\n             must be prepared to address his conduct toward [the\r\n             victim] between 2001 and June 2004.\r\n\r\n376 S.C. at 102, 654 S.E.2d at 855. We never intended in Tumbleston to address\r\nwhen it might be appropriate, or whether it is ever permissible, to instruct the jury\r\nas the trial court did in this case.\r\n\r\nThe majority also relies on State v. Anderson, 59 S.C. 229, 37 S.E. 820 (1901). In\r\nthat case, the defendant was charged with larceny for stealing a cow. 59 S.C. at\r\n230, 37 S.E. at 820. At trial, \"the defendant introduced evidence to prove an alibi.\"\r\nId. The trial court charged the jury that \"the defendant assumes the burden of\r\nproving [his alibi].\" Id. The definition of alibi then, as now, required the\r\ndefendant to prove he could not have committed the crime because he was\r\n\nsomewhere else at the specific time the crime was committed.7 The court's charge\r\nthat the burden of proof is on the defendant—an incorrect charge under modern\r\nlaw8—demonstrates the reason Anderson is not helpful in analyzing the correctness\r\nof the charge in Perry's case. To meet the burden the trial court imposed on him of\r\nproving his alibi, the defendant in Anderson had to prove he was somewhere else at\r\nthe specific time the crime was committed. Because the specific time the crime\r\nwas committed was not part of the State's burden, the circumstances of that case\r\njustified the trial court's charge that time is not an element of the crime.\r\n\r\nFinally, the majority relies on State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859\r\n(1993). I find Schumpert interesting for two reasons. First, the supreme court\r\nchose not to address whether giving the charge was error, but only whether the\r\ncharge caused prejudice. Second, Schumpert relies on State v. Rallo, 304 S.C. 258,\r\n403 S.E.2d 653 (1991). The Schumpert court explained the prejudicial error\r\nin Rallo:    In Rallo the indictment was amended to allege the\r\n             offense occurred on February 14. We held the trial judge\r\n             erred in charging the jury the offense occurred \"on or\r\n\r\n7 Compare State v. Atkins, 49 S.C. 481, 481, 27 S.E. 484, 484 (1897) (reciting the\r\nfollowing definition of alibi from the trial court's charge: \"An alibi means that he\r\nwas at some place other than where the crime was committed at that time, and,\r\ntherefore, could not have committed the crime charged\" (emphasis removed)), with\r\nGlover v. State, 318 S.C. 496, 498, 458 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1995) (stating \"an alibi\r\nderives its potency as a defense from the fact that it involves the physical\r\nimpossibility of the accused's guilt\").\r\n8 See State v. McGhee, 137 S.C. 256, 260-61, 135 S.E. 59, 60 (1926) (stating the\r\nrequirement of imposing the burden of proving alibi on the defendant is \"illogical,\"\r\nand adopting the concurring opinion of Justice Cothran from State v. Des Champs,\r\ninfra); State v. Des Champs, 134 S.C. 179, 181, 131 S.E. 420, 420 (1926)\r\n(Cothran, J., concurring) (\"But it seems to me that the so-called 'affirmative\r\ndefense' of alibi is not an affirmative defense at all. It is simply evidence adduced\r\nby the defendant to sustain his plea of not guilty; that he did not commit the crime\r\nfor the reason that he was not at the scene of the crime at the time of the\r\noccurrence. The burden was upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat the defendant was present at the scene of the crime and actually committed\r\nit.\").\r\n\n             about\" February 14 because the indictment alleged\r\n             February 14 and the defendant had focused on that date\r\n             in presenting evidence of alibi. Essentially, the\r\n             defendant in Rallo did not have notice of any date other\r\n             than that alleged in the indictment and it was error to\r\n             charge the jury with a larger time period.\r\n\r\n312 S.C. at 508, 435 S.E.2d at 863. Rallo is not controlling, but it demonstrates\r\nthat a jury charge correct on its face can constitute prejudicial error if it serves to\r\ndefeat the primary argument the defendant makes in his defense.\r\n\r\nTrial courts do not normally charge the jury as to what is not an element of the\r\ncrime. However, under circumstances that justify doing so, such a charge can be\r\nproper. Anderson is an example of such a circumstance. As another example, it\r\nwas permissible in certain cases for the trial court to instruct the jury what was not\r\nan element of the crime formerly named \"assault and battery with intent to kill.\"9\r\nIn State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 15, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1996), our supreme court\r\nclarified that to prove a defendant guilty of the crime, the State need prove only a\r\ngeneral criminal intent, not a specific intent to kill. In subsequent trials, despite\r\nFoust, defendants would often argue the State did not prove a specific intent to kill.\r\nIn such a circumstance, and certainly others, the trial court could properly instruct\r\nthe jury on what elements the State did not have to prove.\r\n\r\nThere are no circumstances in this case that justify the trial court's instruction to\r\nthe jury that time is not an element of lewd act on a minor. In fact, the\r\ncircumstances of this case made the instruction improper. Perry built his entire\r\npresentation to the jury around what he claimed were the striking inconsistencies in\r\nthe victim's testimony as to when the crime occurred. In particular, Perry argued\r\nthe victim's testimony as to the time of the offense was inconsistent because: (1)\r\nthe victim claimed Brittany was present in the home with her baby when the crime\r\noccurred, and (2) the victim's mother testified she picked up the victim from her\r\nfather's house on January 1, two weeks before Brittany's baby was born. The State\r\nargues the victim's testimony as to the time of the offense is not inconsistent, and\r\nthe record contains support for both positions. Nevertheless, Perry's argument—\r\nthe inconsistency was critical to the jury's evaluation of the credibility of the victim\r\n\r\n9The name \"assault and battery with intent to kill\" was misleading because the\r\nname suggested one of the elements was a specific intent to kill. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-3-620 (2003) (repealed Act No. 273, 2010 S.C. Acts 1949-50).\r\n\nand the State failed to prove the time of the alleged crime—formed the basis of his\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThis case is not unlike Rallo. There, the charge constituted prejudicial error\r\nbecause it defeated the defendant's alibi by enlarging the time the State could prove\r\nfor the crime. Here, the charge contradicted the defendant's claim that the victim's\r\ncredibility was suspect because she could not identify the time of the offense.\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, it was improper for the trial court to instruct\r\nthe jury that \"time is not a material element\" of the crime, and this error prejudiced\r\nPerry. For these reasons, I would reverse.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5258","title":"State v.

We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCurry was charged with throwing bodily fluids on a correctional officer in\r\nviolation of section 24-13-470 of the South Carolina Code (2007) after an incident\r\n\nthat occurred while he was incarcerated at Lexington County Detention Center.\r\nOfficer Frederick Hopkins testified that on August 18, 2010, he was working the\r\nfirst floor of the detention center, which housed inmates with special needs and\r\nmental health issues. That morning, Curry submitted an inmate request form to\r\nOfficer Hopkins for a conjugal visit on the third floor of the detention center. The\r\nthird floor houses the female inmates at the detention center. Because the prison\r\nhad a strict policy of prohibiting sexual contact between inmates, Officer Hopkins\r\ndenied Curry's request. Officer Hopkins stated he returned the request form to\r\nCurry, and Curry was \"cool, very calm, and . . . made no comment\" when Officer\r\nHopkins informed him of the denial.\r\n\r\nLater that day, Officer Hopkins returned to Curry's cell so it could be cleaned. He\r\nreserved Curry's cell for last because there was a strong smell emanating from his\r\ncell, which was later discovered to be a result of Curry \"stockpiling feces\r\nunderneath the sink.\" After he and another officer looked through the flap in the\r\ndoor and determined it was safe to enter, Officer Hopkins stepped inside Curry's\r\ncell, but \"in a split second, [Curry] had lobbed with his right hand, like pitching a\r\nsoftball, the fecal matter which hit [Officer Hopkins] square in the abdomen, [and]\r\ndribbled down and onto [his] right leg.\" Officer Hopkins stated Curry did not say\r\nanything or have any expression on his face when the incident occurred;\r\nspecifically, Officer Hopkins said, \"Even after he . . . threw feces on me, we never\r\nonce cursed each other, we never fought each other, never even argued.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant James Clawson with the Lexington Count Sheriff's Department\r\nremoved Curry from his cell after the incident with Officer Hopkins. According to\r\nLieutenant Clawson, when he entered Curry's cell, Curry had feces on his hands,\r\nface, and clothing. Lieutenant Clawson stated Curry did not resist in any way or\r\nspeak to any of the officers as he was transported to the detention center's medical\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nDr. William Miles, the onsite doctor at the detention center, stated he examined\r\nCurry, who was wearing a suicide gown, following the incident. He stated Curry\r\nwas calm and did not appear to be agitated. Dr. Miles testified that after he\r\nexamined Curry, Curry willingly permitted him to cut Curry's abnormally long\r\nfingernails, and Curry was then released from the medical facility.\r\n\r\nCurry was subsequently interviewed on November 2, 2010, by Dr. Marla Domino,\r\na psychologist with the South Carolina Department of Mental Health (SCDMH).\r\nDr. Domino testified at Curry's pretrial competency hearing as well as at trial for\r\nthe State. Dr. Domino stated she had seen Curry a number of times for forensic\r\n\nevaluations since 2006 and was well aware of his mental health history and\r\nbehavioral issues prior to her November 2010 examination.1 She acknowledged\r\nCurry had a history of refusing to take his medications, including at the time of her\r\ninterview and at the time of trial. According to Dr. Domino, Curry understood the\r\nseriousness of the charge, the differences between a guilty and not guilty plea, and\r\nthe importance of controlling his behavior in the courtroom. She acknowledged\r\nCurry did not always give accurate responses to her questions regarding court\r\nproceedings.2 In her clinical opinion, he was feigning his inability to comprehend\r\ncertain things. She stated he had the capacity to understand the proceedings and\r\nassist in his own defense.\r\n\r\nDr. Domino also testified Curry was able to give her a very coherent, logical\r\nexplanation for his actions. According to Dr. Domino, even if Curry suffered from\r\na mental illness at the time of the offense, his symptoms had to be directly related\r\nto the crime he was accused of committing. In Curry's case, she believed he did\r\nnot lack the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong at the time of the\r\nincident. She explained that Curry and Officer Hopkins both described Curry's\r\nbehavior as calm and cooperative. Based on their separate accounts, she did not\r\nbelieve Curry was experiencing symptoms of a mental illness at the time of the\r\nalleged crime. When questioned as to why she believed Curry was malingering\r\nduring their interview, she stated that individuals who are truly psychotic have\r\ndisorganized speech, a hard time paying attention, and seem like they are\r\nresponding to voices on many occasions. Dr. Domino stated, \"[Curry] was able to\r\nengage in the regular give and take of conversation . . . I could understand his\r\nresponses. They weren't accurate, but . . . [t]hey were logical.\"\r\n\r\nCurry called Dr. Casandra Means, a mental health professional counselor with\r\nSCDMH, to testify at trial. As a counselor at the detention center, she had\r\n1 During cross-examination, Dr. Domino acknowledged the following: (1) Curry\r\nhad been in a \"special school\" from an early age; (2) Curry had a learning\r\ndisability and was emotionally handicapped; (3) Curry suffered a severe head\r\ninjury as a result of a car accident when he was eleven or twelve; (4) Curry had\r\nreceived disability payments since 1995 based on his diagnosis of paranoid\r\nschizophrenia; and (5) prior to his incarceration, Curry slept under a bed,\r\ncomplained of seeing a bald Hispanic man, and believed his family members had\r\nbeen cloned.\r\n2Specifically, Curry stated the prosecutor was his advocate, the trial judge was on\r\nhis side, and his attorney was \"rotten to the core\" and wanted to \"fry him.\"\r\n\ninteracted with Curry prior to the August 2010 incident and stated Curry had a\r\nhistory of mental illness. Although Curry initially interacted with her, as time\r\npassed, Dr. Means testified he became more isolated and would not engage or\r\nrespond to questions. Dr. Means stated she never discussed the August 2010\r\nincident with Curry, but she believed his symptoms were consistent with mania.\r\n\r\nCurry also called Dr. Merrie Cherry, a senior psychiatrist with SCDMH and a\r\nmental health professional counselor at the detention center, to testify at trial. Dr.\r\nCherry stated she saw Curry \"fairly regularly\" because he was detained on the first\r\nfloor and had a significant mental illness. When questioned about her interactions\r\nwith Curry, Dr. Cherry stated that in the past, Curry would answer her questions\r\nbut recently had refused to answer any questions. When Curry was more\r\ndepressed, he would \"cocoon\" himself by wrapping up in his sheets and blankets\r\nand lying on the floor. At those times, she testified he did not want to interact with\r\nothers or leave his cell and his \"affect [wa]s very flat,\" in that he showed no\r\nemotions or expression. Dr. Cherry refused to opine whether Curry understood the\r\nsignificance of his actions at the time of the August 2010 incident, stating she\r\n\"didn't evaluate him for forensic purposes at that time.\"\r\n\r\nCurry's mother and daughter both testified at trial. Both women confirmed Curry\r\nsuffered from a long history of mental illness prior to his incarceration. Neither\r\nCurry's mother nor his daughter could testify to his state of mind in August 2010.\r\n\r\nCurry testified in his own defense. Curry admitted he had received Social Security\r\ndisability benefits in the past for his mental illness and acknowledged he had\r\nreceived treatment at Aiken Mental Health Center, Gilliam Psychiatric Hospital,\r\nand Just Care. Curry reiterated his desire to talk about his constitutional rights, but\r\nattempted to assert his Fifth Amendment right to silence when questioned about\r\nthrowing bodily fluids on Officer Hopkins. When asked about throwing feces on\r\nOfficer Hopkins, he claimed he did not remember doing that, but he admitted to\r\nputting feces on the walls \"several times.\" Curry acknowledged requesting a\r\nconjugal visit, which he stated was denied.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of all testimony, the State argued outside the jury's presence that\r\nCurry was not entitled to charges on guilty but mentally ill and not guilty by reason\r\nof insanity. The State contended Curry failed to prove that his mental illness\r\nprevented him from distinguishing between right and wrong on the day of the\r\nincident. While the State conceded Curry suffered from a mental illness, it\r\nasserted it did not necessarily equate to an inability to be able to distinguish\r\nbetween right and wrong. In response, Curry's counsel stated Dr. Means's\r\n\ntestimony that Curry was manic at the time of the incident was sufficient to sustain\r\nCurry's burden of proof regarding insanity. The circuit court denied Curry's\r\nrequest, stating:\r\n\r\n             There's no question in this case [Curry has] got eccentric\r\n             behavior or antisocial conduct, but I have not heard any\r\n             testimony whatsoever in this record that the defendant\r\n             did not have the ability to distinguish right from wrong. .\r\n             . . [A]nd we're talking about on the date of the incident\r\n             and that's what crucial here . . . the Court is not going to\r\n             charge either of those defenses; that is guilty but mentally\r\n             ill or not guilty by reason of insanity . . . . The question\r\n             will be either guilty or not guilty.\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the circuit court sentenced Curry to eight-\r\nand-one-half years of imprisonment with a recommendation for mental health\r\ntreatment with the Department of Corrections. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\"The law to be charged is determined from the facts presented at trial.\" State v.\r\nLewis, 328 S.C. 273, 278, 494 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1997). This court will not reverse\r\na circuit court's decision to deny a specific request to charge unless the circuit court\r\ncommitted an error of law. State v. Marin, 404 S.C. 615, 619, 745 S.E.2d 148, 151\r\n(Ct. App. 2013); see State v. Commander, 396 S.C. 254, 270, 721 S.E.2d 413, 421-\r\n22 (2011) (\"An appellate court will not reverse the [circuit court]'s decision\r\nregarding a jury charge absent an abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCurry claims the circuit court erred in denying his request to charge the jury on\r\nguilty but mentally ill. We agree.\r\n\r\nAs defined by section 17-24-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (2014),\r\n\r\n             A defendant is guilty but mentally ill if, at the time of the\r\n             commission of the act constituting the offense, he had the\r\n             capacity to distinguish right from wrong or to recognize\r\n             his act as being wrong as defined in [s]ection 17-24-\r\n\n             10(A),3 but because of mental disease or defect he lacked\r\n             sufficient capacity to conform his conduct to the\r\n             requirements of the law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 17-24-20(A) (2014). The guilty but mentally ill statute ensures\r\nthe jury applies the legal definition of insanity properly by emphasizing that a\r\nperson may be mentally ill, yet not legally insane. State v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121,\r\n130, 484 S.E.2d 869, 874 (1997). \"The [guilty but mentally ill] verdict clarifies the\r\ndistinction between a defendant who is not guilty by reason of insanity and one\r\nwho is mentally ill yet not criminally insane and, therefore, is criminally liable.\"\r\nId.\r\n\r\nWe find Curry presented sufficient evidence that he lacked the requisite capacity to\r\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law so as to justify a jury charge of\r\nguilty but mentally ill. The supreme court's decision in State v. Hartfield, 300 S.C.\r\n469, 388 S.E.2d 802 (1990), leads us to this conclusion. In Hartfield, the\r\ndefendant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and possession of crack\r\ncocaine with intent to distribute and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. Id.\r\nat 470, 388 S.E.2d at 802. On appeal to the supreme court, Hartfield contended the\r\ncircuit court erred in ruling he could not present the defense of insanity or attempt\r\nto obtain a verdict of guilty but mentally ill. Id. The circuit court based its ruling\r\non an expert's report who evaluated him four separate times. Id. at 471, 388 S.E.2d\r\nat 803. The expert initially believed Hartfield suffered from psychosis but changed\r\nhis opinion to conclude Hartfield was malingering after observing Hartfield for an\r\nextended time in the state hospital. Id. In contrast, a defense expert opined\r\nHartfield was delusional and incapable of standing trial. Id. The circuit court\r\nrefused to permit Hartfield to produce any evidence relative to either not guilty by\r\nreason of insanity or guilty but mentally ill, finding Hartfield's insanity was caused\r\nby his voluntary use of drugs, and as such, it was not a defense to his crimes. Id.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court reversed, holding that if permanent insanity was caused by the\r\nuse of drugs and destroyed a defendant's ability to know right from wrong, it could\r\nconstitute a defense to a crime. Id. at 473, 388 S.E.2d at 804. Our supreme court\r\nfound Hartfield was entitled to present the defense of insanity or attempt to obtain\r\n\r\n3A defendant is insane if, at the time of the commission of the act constituting the\r\noffense, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked the capacity to\r\ndistinguish moral or legal right from moral or legal wrong or to recognize the\r\nparticular act charged as morally or legally wrong. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-24-10(A)\r\n(2014).\r\n\na verdict of guilty but mentally ill because Hartfield presented evidence at his\r\ncompetency hearing that his use of illicit drugs caused permanent brain damage,\r\nwhich manifested as a mental illness. Id.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the circuit court focused on the testimony of Dr. Domino and\r\nthe lack of specific expert or lay testimony that Curry could distinguish right from\r\nwrong and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law on the date of the\r\nincident. However, we find Dr. Means's opinion that Curry suffered from mania at\r\nthe time of the incident combined with other lay and expert testimony on Curry's\r\nantisocial conduct, odd mannerisms, and isolationist behavior indicate his mental\r\nillness may have prevented Curry from being able to conform his conduct to the\r\nlaw at the time of this offense. We also find Curry's affirmative actions of\r\nstockpiling his feces under his sink and placing feces on his face and clothing at\r\nthe time of the offense created a jury question as to whether he truly appreciated\r\nthe nature of his actions. Arguably, if Curry was willing to keep his feces in his\r\nliving quarters and even to smear them on himself, the jury could reasonably\r\nconclude he lacked the requisite mental capacity to be able to abide by the law.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that a defendant found guilty but mentally ill \"must be sentenced as\r\nprovided by law for a defendant found guilty.\" Hornsby, 326 S.C. at 126, 484\r\nS.E.2d at 872. Although a defendant's sentence is the same regardless of whether\r\nhe is merely guilty or guilty but mentally ill, a defendant found guilty but mentally\r\nill \"is entitled to immediate treatment and evaluation.\" Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 17-24-70 (Supp. 1995)). The circuit court included a recommendation for mental\r\nhealth treatment when it issued Curry's sentence, but the court did not mandate\r\ntreatment as is required for a defendant found guilty but mentally ill pursuant to\r\nsection 17-24-70 of the South Carolina Code (2014).4 Because evidence was\r\npresented from which the jury could have concluded Curry was guilty but mentally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Section 17-24-70(A) states: \"If the sentence imposed upon the defendant includes\r\nthe incarceration of the defendant, the defendant must first be taken to a facility\r\ndesignated by the Department of Corrections for treatment and retained there until\r\nin the opinion of the staff at that facility the defendant may safely be moved to the\r\ngeneral population of the Department of Corrections to serve the remainder of his\r\nsentence.\"\r\n\nill under section 17-24-70, the circuit court's failure to include this jury charge\r\namounted to reversible error.5\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse Curry's conviction and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Because the circuit court's failure to charge the jury on guilty but mentally ill\r\nnecessitates a new trial, we decline to address Curry's arguments regarding his\r\nfitness to stand trial and whether the circuit court properly denied Curry's request\r\nto charge the jury on not guilty by reason of insanity.

McIntosh, and Senior\r\n            Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all\r\n            of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.: Victor White was convicted of murder and armed robbery\r\nstemming from a shooting during an arranged marijuana purchase. The incident\r\ntook place inside of the victim's vehicle at an empty Kentucky Fried Chicken\r\n(KFC) parking lot. White appeals his convictions, arguing the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting his recorded statement because the statement was the direct product of\r\n\nthe impermissible tactic of \"question first, give Miranda1 rights later,\" which has\r\nbeen expressly forbidden by the Supreme Court in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S.\r\n600 (2004), and our supreme court in State v. Navy, 386 S.C. 294, 688 S.E.2d 838\r\n(2010). We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. Voluntariness and Admissibility of White's Statement\r\n\r\nIn both Seibert and Navy, the courts emphasized that Miranda's warnings\r\nrequirement cannot be skirted by interrogative tactics that undermine the very\r\npurpose of Miranda, i.e., unless and until such warnings and waiver are given, no\r\nevidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against a defendant at\r\ntrial. See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 478–79; Seibert, 542 U.S. at 617; Navy, 386 S.C. at\r\n303–04, 688 S.E.2d at 842.\r\n\r\nHere, there is conflicting evidence as to whether White's statement was taken in\r\nviolation of our supreme court's holding in Navy. By White's testimony, alone, he\r\npresents evidence that Navy's forbidden \"question-first, give Miranda warnings\r\nlater\" tactic was employed in his interrogation. On the other hand, the State points\r\nto the testimony of two investigators who stressed they did not elicit any\r\ninformation from White prior to his signing of the Miranda rights waiver form.\r\nThe State argues the investigators' testimony is further corroborated by the waiver\r\nform, which indicates White voluntarily waived his rights prior to answering any\r\nquestions.2\r\n\r\nBecause there is conflicting evidence, the trial court was charged with making a\r\nfinding that White received Miranda warnings and intelligently waived his right to\r\nsilence prior to making a statement. See State v. Silver, 307 S.C. 326, 330, 414\r\nS.E.2d 813, 815 (Ct. App. 1992) (\"Where there is conflicting evidence regarding\r\nthe statements, the court must make a finding as to their validity.\"). White\r\nconcedes his statement was given \"voluntarily.\" However, he contests the timing\r\nof the Miranda warnings, which necessarily implicates State v. Navy and the issue\r\nof whether he intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent prior to\r\nmaking a statement. See State v. Miller, 375 S.C. 370, 380, 652 S.E.2d 444, 449\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). \n\r\n2 The State also cites both White's and the investigators' testimony stating the \n\r\ninitial questioning did not begin until \"around midnight,\" which coincides with the \n\r\ntiming listed on the signed Miranda rights waiver form (11:55 P.M.).\n\r\n\n(Ct. App. 2007) (finding the \"intelligent waiver mandate\" is in addition to the\r\nvoluntariness requirement of Miranda).\r\n\r\nIn the pre-trial Jackson v. Denno3 hearing, the trial court did not make an explicit\r\nfinding as to whether White's statement was taken in violation of State v. Navy.\r\nRather, the trial court simply found White's statement was \"freely and voluntarily\r\ngiven and the jury will be able to hear the statement.\" Because White already\r\nconceded the voluntariness of his statement, but challenged the timing of the\r\nMiranda warnings with the taking of his statement as a Navy violation, the trial\r\ncourt was charged with making a factual finding as to this issue, i.e., whether the\r\ninterrogative procedure through which the statement was obtained comported with\r\nNavy. Therefore, the trial court erred by not making sufficient findings of fact as\r\nto the statement's admissibility.\r\n\r\n2. Harmless Error\r\n\r\nEven if, as White argues, his statement was admitted in violation of Navy, we\r\nbelieve any error in its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 441 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 1993), this court\r\nreiterated the Supreme Court of the United States' holding in Chapman v.\r\nCalifornia4 that error of even constitutional magnitude may be deemed harmless if,\r\n\"considering the entire record on appeal, the reviewing court finds beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\" Id. at 86, 441\r\nS.E.2d at 640 (citing Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967)); see also Taylor\r\nv. State, 312 S.C. 179, 181, 439 S.E.2d 820, 821 (1993). Similarly, in State v.\r\nEasler, our supreme court intimated that any error in the failure to suppress a\r\nstatement allegedly taken in violation of Miranda is subject to a harmless error\r\nanalysis. 327 S.C. 121, 129, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621–22 (1997); see also State v.\r\nNewell, 303 S.C. 471, 477, 401 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding failure to\r\nsuppress evidence for Miranda violation harmless where record contained\r\noverwhelming evidence of guilt); State v. Lynch, 375 S.C. 628, 636, 654 S.E.2d\r\n292, 296 (Ct. App. 2007) (\"The failure to suppress evidence for possible Miranda\r\nviolations is harmless if the record contains sufficient evidence to prove guilt\r\n\r\n\r\n3 378 U.S. 368 (1964) (outlining the procedure for a pre-trial hearing to determine\r\nthe voluntariness and admissibility of a defendant's contested statement).\r\n4 386 U.S. 18 (1967).\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\").5 Harmless error rules, even in dealing with\r\nconstitutional errors, \"serve a very useful purpose insofar as they block setting\r\naside convictions for small errors or defects that have little, if any, likelihood of\r\nhaving changed the result of the trial.\" Chapman, 386 U.S. at 22.\r\n\r\nHere, considering the entire record on appeal, we conclude beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that any alleged error in admitting White's statement was harmless. White's\r\nappellate counsel insists the admission of White's statement was \"devastating\"\r\nbecause it allowed police to place White at the crime scene. However,\r\nnotwithstanding White's statement, cell phone evidence clearly placed Victim and\r\nWhite together at the time and place of the murder. With information \"pinged\"\r\nfrom Victim's and White's cell phones to nearby cell towers, investigators were\r\nable to triangulate Victim's and White's positions and movements leading up to the\r\nmurder. The data confirmed Victim and White were near the KFC and within\r\nclose proximity of each other at the time of the murder. Furthermore, the data also\r\nrevealed that Victim's last answered phone communication was an incoming call\r\nfrom White placed immediately before the estimated time of the murder.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the testimony presented at trial also placed White at the crime scene\r\nand overwhelmingly established White's guilt. Reggie Miller, an accomplice,\r\ntestified he and White agreed to participate in a robbery, under the guise of a\r\nmarijuana purchase, on the night of the murder. Miller recalled White made a\r\nphone call to Victim and arranged a meeting in the KFC parking lot near Benedict\r\nCollege in Columbia, South Carolina. Miller testified that after he and White\r\nwalked to KFC, Victim pulled into the parking lot in his vehicle.6 Miller stressed\r\nWhite got in the back seat of Victim's vehicle and he sat in the front passenger seat.\r\nMiller testified that seconds after getting into the vehicle, White shot Victim in the\r\nback of the head from the back seat. After the murder, Miller claimed White was\r\nlaughing about it, and White admitted to others that he killed Victim.\r\n\r\nIn line with Miller's testimony, Demond Sanford, the other accomplice, testified\r\nabout the details of the murder. Sanford admitted he stood on the street corner and\r\nserved as \"a lookout\" during the robbery. Sanford recalled White and Miller got in\r\nVictim's vehicle after it pulled into the KFC parking lot, and shortly thereafter\r\n\r\n5 Cf. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310 (1991) (holding the erroneous \n\r\nadmission of an involuntary confession is subject to a harmless error analysis when \n\r\nthe defendant's guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt). \n\r\n6 The KFC was closed for the night.\n\r\n\n\"[he] heard a loud pop.\" Sanford further testified that immediately after Miller\r\nwalked away from the scene, Miller, in a panicked state, told him that White shot\r\nVictim. Conversely, Sanford testified White appeared calm. Once Miller, White,\r\nand Sanford regrouped in the dorm room after the shooting, White enlisted\r\nSanford's help to go back to Victim's car to find a scale with which to weigh the\r\nstolen marijuana. Sanford testified he took the scale from Victim's side, who was\r\nnot moving when they returned to the vehicle. When questioned on the stand,\r\nSanford denied White admitted shooting Victim. However, the State impeached\r\nSanford's testimony with a prior statement given to police in which he told\r\ninvestigators White admitted shooting Victim.\r\n\r\nStill, other testimony from the trial established White's overwhelming guilt.\r\nJeremiah Henderson—a friend who let White, Miller, and Sanford into his\r\nBenedict College dorm room after the murder—testified that White laughed about\r\nthe incident and repeatedly boasted, \"I shot that man [in the robbery]\" and \"I can't\r\nbelieve [Victim] let me sit behind him.\" Henderson also testified he saw White\r\nwith a gun that night. Finally, Nathaniel Jones—roommate of Henderson and an\r\n\"ear\" witness who pretended to be asleep in the dorm room7—testified he\r\noverheard White brag and laugh about killing somebody.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nEven though the trial court's Denno finding was insufficient, we find the entire\r\nrecord on appeal establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that any error in the\r\nadmission of White's statement did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., dissenting: I agree with the majority that the trial court failed to make\r\nsufficient factual findings. From the trial court's conclusory statement, we cannot\r\ndetermine whether the court admitted the statement for the reason the court\r\nexpressed—the statement was freely and voluntarily given, a point the defendant\r\n\r\n7According to Jones, he was awoken when White, Miller, Sanford, and Henderson\r\ncame into his room around 2:00 A.M., but he pretended to be asleep because he did\r\nnot want to become involved.\r\n\nconceded—or the court actually ruled on the issue raised—whether the police\r\nviolated the principles set forth in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 601-02, and\r\nState v. Navy, 386 S.C. 294, 302, 688 S.E.2d 838, 841 (2010). In my opinion,\r\nhowever, if there was error in admitting the statement, the error was not harmless.\r\nI would remand for a hearing and require the trial court to make sufficient factual\r\nfindings.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5261","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOfficers arrested Vincent Harris at approximately 3:30 p.m. on June 24, 2010, after \n\r\nhe sold crack cocaine to a confidential informant.1 In an attempt to get out of jail \n\r\non bond, Harris agreed to arrange a drug transaction with his supplier, Pope.2\n\r\nHarris called Pope to arrange a deal that same day for a half ounce of crack cocaine\n\r\nfor six hundred dollars.3 Harris told Union County Sheriff's Sergeant James \n\r\nJohnson that Pope would be traveling on Highway 176 from Spartanburg into \n\r\nUnion, and he would be driving a black Ford Expedition. Sergeant Johnson \n\r\nrelayed the information about the deal and the vehicle to officers who set up at \n\r\nvarious locations along Highway 176. Harris called Pope to check on his location \n\r\nand told Sergeant Johnson that Pope had just passed the Lighthouse Fish Camp. \n\r\nSergeant Johnson relayed Pope's location to the officers on the highway, and \n\r\nCaptain James McNeil said he had a visual sighting on an Expedition at the \n\r\nLighthouse Fish Camp. At approximately 6 p.m., Sheriff David Taylor saw the \n\r\nvehicle; he activated his blue lights; the Expedition pulled over; and Lieutenant \n\r\nJohn Sherfield and Captain McNeil pulled in behind the vehicles. \n\r\n\r\nThree men were in the vehicle: Pope, Randy Crosby, and Lashad Brewton. \n\r\nBrewton was driving; Pope was in the front passenger seat; and Crosby was in the \n\r\nright rear seat. The vehicle was registered to Pope's wife, but Pope's license was \n\r\nsuspended. Brewton stopped in the median instead of the right shoulder of the \n\r\nhighway and took about a minute to pull over. As Lieutenant Sherfield approached \n\r\nthe vehicle, he observed Crosby turn around, look back at him, bend down, and sit \n\r\nback up. After the officers removed the three men from the vehicle and \n\r\nhandcuffed them, Lieutenant Sherfield searched the vehicle. Underneath the seat \n\r\nwhere Crosby had been sitting, he found a digital scale with white residue. He \n\r\ntested the residue with a field test kit and determined it was cocaine. All three men\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The confidential informant knew Harris as \"Vince.\" \n\r\n2 Harris testified his bond was reduced to $2,000 in exchange for making the calls \n\r\nto Pope. He later pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine and was sentenced \n\r\nto three years' imprisonment. Harris was facing ten to thirty years' imprisonment if \n\r\nhe had not offered to help the police.\n\r\n3 A half ounce equals fourteen grams. \n\r\n\nwere arrested for possession of cocaine. The officers did not find drugs on the men\r\nwhen they searched them on the side of the road. However, Lieutenant Sherfield\r\nfound two hundred eighty dollars and a cell phone on Brewton, and five hundred\r\nseventy dollars on Crosby. The officers also found a cell phone on Pope that had\r\nfourteen incoming calls and five outgoing calls on that day to a person listed as\r\n\"Vince.\" After arriving at the jail, Corporal Russell Vinson searched the vehicle he\r\nused to transport Brewton and Crosby.4 In the back, underneath the seat where\r\nCrosby had been seated, Corporal Vinson found a yellow plastic bag containing a\r\nlittle more than eleven grams of crack cocaine.\r\n\r\nPope was indicted for trafficking more than ten grams but less than twenty-eight\r\ngrams of crack cocaine. The case proceeded to trial on December 6 through 8,\r\n2011. The State tried Pope with his two co-defendants, Crosby and Brewton. The\r\njury found Pope guilty of the lesser-included offense of possession with intent to\r\ndistribute crack cocaine. The court sentenced him to fifteen years, suspended upon\r\nthe service of ten years with five years' probation. The court denied Pope's motion\r\nto reconsider his sentence. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, this court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the\r\ntrial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. State v. Edwards,\r\n384 S.C. 504, 508, 682 S.E.2d 820, 822 (2009). Thus, on review, this court is\r\nlimited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion. Id. An abuse\r\nof discretion occurs when the court's decision is unsupported by the evidence or\r\ncontrolled by an error of law. State v. Black, 400 S.C. 10, 16, 732 S.E.2d 880, 884\r\n(2012). \"This [c]ourt does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial court's\r\nruling is supported by any evidence.\" Edwards, 384 S.C. at 508, 682 S.E.2d at\r\n822.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Corporal Vinson testified he searched his vehicle prior to putting Brewton and\r\nCrosby in the back seat to make sure there was nothing there.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Reasonable Suspicion\r\n\r\nPope argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence\r\nseized during the search of the vehicle because law enforcement did not have\r\nreasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, this court only reviews errors of law. State v. Butler, 353 S.C.\r\n383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003). This standard of review also\r\napplies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain\r\nevidence. Id. In Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases, our review is\r\nlimited to determining whether there is any evidence to support the trial court's\r\nfinding. State v. Moore, 404 S.C. 634, 640-41, 746 S.E.2d 352, 355 (Ct. App.\r\n2013). This court will not reverse a trial court's findings of fact merely because we\r\nwould have reached a different conclusion. Id.\r\n\r\n\"A police officer may stop and briefly detain and question a person for\r\ninvestigative purposes, without treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when\r\nthe officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of\r\nprobable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal activity.\" State v.\r\nWoodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 546, 544 S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 2001). \"The term\r\n'reasonable suspicion' requires a particularized and objective basis that would lead\r\none to suspect another of criminal activity.\" Id. In analyzing reasonable suspicion,\r\n\"it is entirely appropriate for courts to credit the practical experience of officers\r\nwho observe on a daily basis what transpires on the street.\" State v. Wallace, 392\r\nS.C. 47, 52, 707 S.E.2d 451, 453 (Ct. App. 2011) (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitations omitted). \"In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the whole\r\npicture must be considered.\" Woodruff, 344 S.C. at 546, 544 S.E.2d at 295.\r\n\"Factors that are alone consistent with 'innocent travel' can, when 'taken together'\r\nproduce a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\" Wallace, 392 S.C. at 52, 707\r\nS.E.2d at 453 (quoting United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 9 (1989)). \"In\r\napplying the concept of reasonable suspicion to the various facts of a case, '[i]t is\r\nthe entire mosaic that counts, not single tiles.'\" Id. (quoting United States v.\r\nWhitehead, 849 F.2d 849, 858 (4th Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nPre-trial, Pope moved to suppress the drugs seized during the search of the vehicle.\r\nDuring trial, Pope again moved to suppress the evidence, arguing no reasonable\r\nsuspicion existed for the traffic stop, and law enforcement did not have probable\r\ncause to search the vehicle. The State responded the corroboration between the\r\n\ninformation Harris gave Sergeant Johnson and the officers' observations gave them\r\nreasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe court denied the motion to suppress, stating, \"I think the ice here is thin, but I\r\nthink it's thick enough to support the arrest, the stop first, then the search and then\r\nthe arrest, and they went in that order.\" The court determined Harris was not a\r\nconfidential informant, but he was \"somewhere between [a] confidential informant\r\nand [an] anonymous tip[ster].\" The court found law enforcement had reasonable\r\nsuspicion to stop the vehicle:\r\n\r\n             [L]ooking at the totality of the circumstances, . . . it was a\r\n             police investigation that determined the validity of the\r\n             information they received from [Harris] . . . . Not a lot of\r\n             information, that's true, but enough, I think, to establish\r\n             probable cause to make the stop, and that corroboration is\r\n             that a black Ford Expedition would be coming from\r\n             Spartanburg to Union on 176 out of Spartanburg. That\r\n             alone would not be enough, but the . . . key is the fact\r\n             that [Harris] . . . gave information that he had been\r\n             contacted by whoever was on the other end of that phone,\r\n             whether it was [Pope] or not, that the car in question was\r\n             passing the Lighthouse Fish Camp, and that was\r\n             confirmed by [Captain] McNeil . . . . So I think that's\r\n             enough to create probable cause for the stop.\r\n\r\nPope argues on appeal the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the\r\ntraffic stop because: (1) the information provided by Harris is inherently\r\nunreliable; (2) the vehicle was not in a high crime area; (3) the vehicle was\r\ntraveling legally and no citations were issued; (4) there was no evidence of\r\nattempted flight; (5) there was no evidence of evasive behavior; (6) the time was\r\n6:00 pm on June 24, so it was not late; (7) the trial court relied on incorrect\r\ninformation that Captain McNeil saw the Ford Expedition at the Lighthouse, when\r\nit was actually a mile down the interstate; and (8) law enforcement failed to verify\r\nany information regarding the black Ford Expedition prior to the stop. Therefore,\r\nhe asserts the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence seized by law\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Peters, 271 S.C. 498, 502-03, 248 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1978), our supreme\r\ncourt determined that where the informant gave the officer a description of an\r\nautomobile that would contain marijuana and would be leaving shortly, the\r\n\nofficer's direct observation of an automobile conforming in every respect to the\r\ninformant's tip provided sufficient circumstances to assure reliability of the\r\ninformant's information. \"In determining whether the evidence is sufficiently\r\ndetailed to give rise to probable cause, all the evidence within the arresting officer's\r\nknowledge may be considered, including the details observed while responding to\r\ninformation received.\" State v. Roper, 274 S.C. 14, 17, 260 S.E.2d 705, 706\r\n(1979). Additionally, \"a non-confidential informant should be given a higher level\r\nof credibility because he exposes himself to public view and to possible criminal\r\nand civil liability should the information he supplied prove to be false.\" State v.\r\nDriggers, 322 S.C. 506, 511, 473 S.E.2d 57, 60 (Ct. App. 1996); see also Lopez v.\r\nState, 664 S.E.2d 866, 869 (Ga. Ct. App. 2008) (\"[I]n terms of providing probable\r\ncause for an arrest, the admissions against penal interest of a known informant in\r\nthe hands of police (even though that informant's name is not disclosed at the trial\r\nof the accused) are valuable facts indicating that the informant is telling the truth\r\nand is reliable.\").\r\n\r\nSergeant Johnson was at the jail with Harris when Harris made several phone calls\r\nto Pope, and Pope made several calls to Harris. Sergeant Johnson testified he\r\nheard Harris on the phone and told Lieutenant Sherfield that Harris arranged a\r\ntransaction to purchase fourteen grams of crack cocaine from Pope for six hundred\r\ndollars. Sergeant Johnson said Pope told Harris he would be traveling on Highway\r\n176 into Union County from Spartanburg County in a black Ford Expedition.\r\nSergeant Johnson said other people were in the vehicle because Harris could hear\r\nthem talking in the background while he was on the phone with Pope. During a\r\nsubsequent phone call, Pope told Harris he was almost in Union County and was\r\ndriving past the Lighthouse Fish Camp. Sergeant Johnson radioed officers Pope's\r\nlocation, and Captain McNeil said he had a visual on the black Ford Expedition at\r\nLighthouse Fish Camp heading towards Union. Captain McNeil followed the\r\nvehicle in his unmarked truck, and Lieutenant Sherfield followed behind him until\r\nSheriff Taylor initiated the stop. As Lieutenant Sherfield approached the vehicle,\r\nhe observed Crosby turn around, look back at him, bend down, and sit back up.\r\n\r\nWe find Harris' description of the vehicle, including the color, make, and model;\r\nthe highway and direction the vehicle would be traveling; the location of the\r\nvehicle at a specific time; and that more than one person was in the vehicle, was\r\ncorroborated by officers observing a vehicle matching the exact description,\r\ntraveling in the specified direction, located in the stated area, and containing more\r\nthan one person. Furthermore, Harris was not a confidential informant and\r\nexposed himself to criminal liability should the information he supplied to officers\r\nprove to be false. Therefore, we find the trial court did not err in denying the\r\n\nmotion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of the vehicle because\r\nlaw enforcement had reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop.\r\n\r\nII.   Probable Cause\r\n\r\nPope argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence\r\nseized during the search of the vehicle because law enforcement did not have\r\nprobable cause to believe the vehicle contained evidence of criminal activity and\r\nno exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless search. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA warrantless search is generally per se unreasonable, and therefore, violates the\r\nFourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. State\r\nv. Weaver, 374 S.C. 313, 319, 649 S.E.2d 479, 482 (2007). However, a\r\nwarrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny if the search falls within\r\none of several well-recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement, one of\r\nwhich is the automobile exception. Id. \"Pursuant to the automobile exception, if\r\nthere is probable cause to search a vehicle, a warrant is not necessary so long as the\r\nsearch is based on facts that would justify the issuance of a warrant, even though a\r\nwarrant has not been actually obtained.\" Id. at 320, 649 S.E.2d at 482. Probable\r\ncause has been defined as \"'a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\r\ncrime will be found in a particular place.'\" State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 50, 625\r\nS.E.2d 216, 221 (2006) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)). \"The\r\nautomobile exception to the search warrant requirement is based on: (1) the ready\r\nmobility of automobiles and the potential that evidence may be lost or destroyed\r\nbefore a warrant is obtained and (2) the lessened expectation of privacy in motor\r\nvehicles which are subject to government regulation.\" Weaver, 374 S.C. at 320,\r\n649 S.E.2d at 482. \"The automobile exception does not contain a separate\r\nexigency requirement.\" Id.\r\n\r\nDuring trial, Pope again moved to suppress the evidence, arguing the officers did\r\nnot have probable cause to search the vehicle. The State argued the officers had\r\nreasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle, and therefore, they had probable cause to\r\nsearch it. The State maintained the officers had probable cause to think the vehicle\r\nwould contain illegal drugs that were about to be used in the drug transaction\r\nHarris arranged, so they had a right to search the vehicle. The court found the\r\nsearch was proper under the automobile exception.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Pope argues the officers did not have probable cause to believe the\r\nvehicle contained evidence of criminal activity because they failed to conduct an\r\ninvestigation to gain probable cause. He asserts they only had the unreliable\r\n\ninformation provided by Harris, who was facing jail time. Therefore, he asserts the\r\ntrial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence seized by law enforcement.\r\n\r\nWe find that based on the corroboration of Harris' information—including the\r\ndescription of the vehicle, the highway and direction the vehicle would be\r\ntraveling, the location of the vehicle at a specific time, and that more than one\r\nperson was in the vehicle—combined with an officer observing Crosby turn\r\naround, look back at him, bend down, and sit back up, gave officers probable cause\r\nto search the vehicle for the drugs Harris had arranged to purchase. Therefore, the\r\ntrial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress the evidence seized during\r\nthe search of the vehicle because law enforcement had probable cause to believe\r\nthe vehicle contained evidence of criminal activity.\r\n\r\nIII.   Chain of Custody\r\n\r\nPope argues the trial court erred in finding a sufficient chain of custody existed to\r\nadmit the evidence seized during the search of the vehicle and the drug evidence\r\nfound in the police car. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"[T]his court has long held that a party offering into evidence fungible items such\r\nas drugs or blood samples must establish a complete chain of custody as far as\r\npracticable.\" State v. Sweet, 374 S.C. 1, 6, 647 S.E.2d 202, 205 (2007). \"Where an\r\nanalyzed substance that has passed through several hands, the identity of\r\nindividuals who acquired the evidence and what was done with the evidence\r\nbetween the taking and the analysis must not be left to conjecture.\" Id.\r\n\"Testimony from each custodian of fungible evidence, however, is not a\r\nprerequisite to establishing a chain of custody sufficient for admissibility.\" Id. at 7,\r\n647 S.E.2d at 206. \"[I]f the identity of each person handling the evidence is\r\nestablished, and the manner of handling is reasonably demonstrated, no abuse of\r\ndiscretion by the trial court is shown in admitting the evidence absent proof of\r\ntampering, bad faith, or ill-motive.\" Id. at 6, 647 S.E.2d at 205-06. \"[T]he chain of\r\ncustody need be established only as far as practicable, and we reiterate that every\r\nperson handling the evidence need not be identified in all cases.\" State v. Hatcher,\r\n392 S.C. 86, 95, 708 S.E.2d 750, 755 (2011).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, \"[w]hile the chain of custody requirement is strict where fungible\r\nevidence is involved, where the issue is the admissibility of non-fungible\r\nevidence—that is, evidence that is unique and identifiable—the establishment of a\r\nstrict chain of custody is not required.\" State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620\r\nS.E.2d 737, 741 (2005).\r\n\n             If the offered item possesses characteristics which are\r\n             fairly unique and readily identifiable, and if the substance\r\n             of which the item is composed is relatively impervious to\r\n             change, the trial court is viewed as having broad\r\n             discretion to admit merely on the basis of testimony that\r\n             the item is the one in question and is in a substantially\r\n             unchanged condition.\r\n\r\nId. at 134, 620 S.E.2d at 741-42.\r\n\r\nDuring trial, Pope moved to suppress the scales found during the search of the\r\nvehicle, arguing the State failed to establish a sufficient chain of custody. The\r\nState responded that Lieutenant Sherfield testified he found the scales and put the\r\ncase number on the scales.\r\n\r\nThe court addressed the chain of custody issue as it related to the scales found in\r\nthe vehicle: [T]here's certainly a lot of questions about the way it was\r\n             handled, but it was not a fungible item. It's like a pistol\r\n             or a shotgun or a television that could be not—I guess it\r\n             could be tampered with. In fact, the battery was missing,\r\n             but the character of it is not readily changeable, is not\r\n             fungible; that it, it cannot be mixed in with something\r\n             else and be confused. It could be under the way it was\r\n             kept, had it not been marked, but it was marked on the\r\n             [scales] itself. [If] [i]t could only be marked on the bag,\r\n             we'd have a problem because the bag came open while it\r\n             was in custody. But, it's my understanding of the\r\n             testimony . . . that there is an identifying number on the\r\n             [scales] itself. So I find that the . . . scales, I'm not going\r\n             to suppress the introduction of the scales.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the court entered the scales over Pope's objection.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Pope argues the trial court erred in finding a sufficient chain of custody\r\nexisted because the scales were not secured in an evidence bag and one of the\r\nbatteries was missing, and Lieutenant Sherfield provided false information on the\r\naffidavit accompanying the evidence bag.\r\n\nWe agree with the trial court that the scales were a non-fungible item; therefore,\r\nthe establishment of a strict chain of custody was not required. However, the State\r\nalso presented evidence of the chain of custody. Lieutenant Sherfield testified he\r\nfound the scales in the vehicle, put the case number on the scales, and secured it\r\ninside a locked vault. He explained the scales were not still in the original\r\nevidence bag because that bag had broken open when he got it out of the vault the\r\nday before. Also, he testified a battery was missing from the scales, but was not\r\nmissing when he put the scales into the vault. He asserted he had the scales in his\r\nvault the entire time.\r\n\r\nDuring trial, Pope moved to exclude the crack cocaine found in the police car\r\nbased on an alleged problem with the chain of custody because Lieutenant\r\nSherfield's affidavit stated he seized the drugs from Crosby, Brewton, and Pope\r\nwhen he was not the one who seized the drugs. The court denied the motion.\r\n\r\nWe find the evidence shows the State properly established the chain of custody as\r\nto the drugs found in the police car. Lieutenant Sherfield testified he took the\r\ncrack cocaine Corporal Vinson found in the back seat of the patrol car back to his\r\noffice; secured it in an evidence bag to be sent to SLED for analysis; marked the\r\nbag with his name and the date; and secured the evidence in a vault in his office.\r\nLieutenant Sherfield transported the evidence to SLED, along with several other\r\nevidence bags, on September 21, 2010. Willie Smith, a senior criminalist-chemist\r\nin the drug analysis department of SLED, testified he received the evidence on\r\nSeptember 22, 2010. He determined the substance was eleven and a half grams of\r\ncrack cocaine. He testified to the chain of custody of the drugs; that the evidence\r\nbag was still sealed when he received it; he resealed it after he tested it; and it was\r\nstill in the same condition it was when he resealed it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the trial court did not err in admitting either the scales or the drugs\r\nfound in the police car because the scales were a non-fungible item and the\r\nestablishment of a strict chain of custody was not required, and a complete chain of\r\ncustody was established for the drugs, which were a fungible item.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the decision of trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5262","title":"Bloody Point Property v.

Fingerhut and Patricia M. Santry were\r\nbona fide purchasers for value pursuant to section 15-39-870 of the South Carolina\r\nCode. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis action arises from the foreclosure sale of Lot 55, Daufuskie Island Club,\r\nPhase l, Bloody Point, in Beaufort County (the Property). The Bloody Point\r\nProperty Owners Association, Inc. (the Association) commenced the foreclosure\r\naction on May 17, 2011. The Association asserted claims for foreclosure of a lien\r\nagainst the Property's owners, William A. Ashton, Jr. and Michelle C. Ashton\r\n(Appellants),1 for payment of Association dues and fees.\r\n\r\nAppellants are residents of Chester County, Pennsylvania. The foreclosure\r\nsummons and complaint were delivered to the Chester County Sheriff's Office (the\r\nSheriff's Office) for service on Appellants at their last known address. According\r\nto the affidavits of service returned by the Sheriff's Office, a deputy unsuccessfully\r\nattempted to serve Appellants on four separate occasions. Thereafter, Julie\r\nScarfino, counsel for the Association, filed an affidavit for service by publication.\r\nOn July 20, 2011, the Beaufort County Clerk of Court filed an order of publication\r\nauthorizing service of Appellants by publishing a copy of the summons and\r\ncomplaint in Beaufort County's The Island Packet newspaper once a week for three\r\nconsecutive weeks and mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to\r\nAppellants at their last known address.\r\n\r\nOn September 27, 2011, the master-in-equity found Appellants in default.\r\nSubsequently, on December 2, 2011, the master entered a report and judgment of\r\nforeclosure and sale wherein he held Appellants owed the Association $2,971.70 in\r\nunpaid assessments and $5,738.97 in attorney's fees and costs. A foreclosure sale\r\nwas held on January 3, 2012. David L. Fingerhut and Patricia Santry (the\r\nFingerhuts) purchased the Property for $8,800 at the sale.\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 2012, Appellants filed a motion to vacate/set aside the foreclosure.\r\nIn their motion, Appellants argued the foreclosure sale should be set aside because\r\nthe sales price was so low as to \"shock the conscience\" of the court. Appellants\r\nfurther asserted the Association improperly served the summons and complaint by\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Appellants purchased the Property in 2001 for $201,500.\r\n\r\n \r\n\npublication. Appellants did not dispute the validity of the debt or their failure to\r\npay dues and fees to the Association.\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 2012, the Fingerhuts filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion\r\nto vacate, wherein they argued they were good faith purchasers for value under\r\nsection 15-39-870 of the South Carolina Code. The Fingerhuts further asserted (1)\r\n$2,793.20 in taxes and fees unpaid by Appellants should be added to the sale price;\r\n(2) the foreclosure sales price did not shock the conscience of the court; and (3) the\r\nAssociation properly served Appellants pursuant to section 15-9-710 of the South\r\nCarolina Code.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 2012, the master issued an order denying the motion to vacate, holding\r\n(1) the Fingerhuts were good faith purchasers for value; (2) the Fingerhuts paid\r\n$11,593.20 for the Property; (3) the foreclosure sales price did not shock the\r\nconscience of the court; (4) the Association complied with the order for\r\npublication; and (5) Appellants were properly served with the summons and\r\ncomplaint. On July 25, 2012, Appellants filed a motion to reconsider the master's\r\norder denying the motion to vacate. The master denied the motion in a form order.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe determination of whether to set aside a foreclosure sale is a matter within the\r\ndiscretion of the trial court.

App. 2008). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\nconclusions of the circuit court are either controlled by an error of law or are based\r\non unsupported factual conclusions.\" Carson v.

Bona Fide Purchasers\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in finding the Fingerhuts were bona fide\r\npurchasers for value pursuant to section 15-39-870 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 15-39-870,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             [u]pon the execution and delivery by the proper officer of\r\n             the court of a deed for any property sold at a judicial sale\r\n             under a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction the\r\n             proceedings under which such sale is made shall be\r\n             deemed res judicata as to any and all bona fide\r\n             purchasers for value without notice, notwithstanding such\r\n             sale may not subsequently be confirmed by the court.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-39-870 (2005). \"The rationale for the statute is the well-\r\nestablished public policy of protecting good faith purchasers and upholding the\r\nfinality of a judicial sale.\" Robinson v. Estate of Harris, 378 S.C. 140, 144-45, 662\r\nS.E.2d 420, 422 (Ct. App. 2008) aff'd, 390 S.C. 272, 701 S.E.2d 740 (2010),\r\n(citing Cumbie v. Newberry, 251 S.C. 33, 37, 159 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1968) (stating\r\n\"a sound public policy requires the validity of judicial sales be upheld, if in reason\r\nand justice it can be done\"); Wooten v. Seanch, 187 S.C. 219, 222, 196 S.E. 877,\r\n878 (1938) (upholding a foreclosure sale in which the mortgagee purchased the\r\nproperty sold and further stating that, to set aside a sale, \"there must be such\r\nirregularity in the proceedings as to show that the sale was not fairly made, or that\r\nappellant was defrauded or misled to his injury and loss\")).\r\n\r\nHere, the master relied on Robinson in finding the Fingerhuts were bona fide\r\npurchasers for value. In Robinson, the defaulting owner of the subject property\r\nsought to vacate the foreclosure sale due to ineffective service. 378 S.C. at 143,\r\n662 S.E.2d at 421. This court noted the bona fide purchaser submitted documents\r\nfrom the court file demonstrating (1) service was made upon defendants; (2) both\r\ndefendants were in default; (3) the attorneys of record were notified of the hearing;\r\nand (4) neither defendants were in the United States military service. Id. at 145,\r\n662 S.E.2d at 423. The court further noted the purchaser had satisfied all of the\r\nelements to be considered a bona fide purchaser for value: (1) actual payment of\r\nthe purchase price of the property, (2) acquisition of legal title to the property, or\r\nthe best right to it, and (3) a bona fide purchase, \"i.e., in good faith and with\r\nintegrity of dealing, without notice of a lien or defect.\" Id. at 146, 662 S.E.2d at\r\n423.\r\n\r\nRelying on Cumbie, Appellants argue the foreclosure sale should be set aside\r\nbecause the Fingerhuts were not bona fide purchasers for value. In Cumbie, our\r\nsupreme court held:\r\n\r\n             A sound public policy requires that the validity of\r\n             judicial sales be upheld, if in reason and justice it can be\r\n\r\n \r\n\n             done. In the furtherance of this principle, our decisions\r\n             have applied the general rule, applicable here, that a\r\n             purchaser in good faith at a judicial sale is not affected by\r\n             irregularities in the proceedings or even error in the\r\n             judgment, under which the sale is made; but is required at\r\n             his peril only to make inquiry as to the jurisdiction of the\r\n             court which ordered the sale, and whether all proper\r\n             parties were before the court when the order was made.\r\n\r\n251 S.C. at 37, 159 S.E.2d at 917. Appellants contend the Fingerhuts failed to (1)\r\nproperly inquire as to the jurisdiction of the court that ordered the foreclosure sale\r\nand (2) properly and sufficiently inquire as to whether all parties were properly\r\nbefore the court when the order was made. Additionally, Appellants argue the\r\norder of publication did not comply with the publication requirements of section\r\n15-9-740 of the South Carolina Code. Pursuant to section 15-9-740,\r\n\r\n             [t]he order of publication shall direct the publication to\r\n             be made in one newspaper, to be designated by the\r\n             officer before whom the application is made, most likely\r\n             to give notice to the person to be served and for such\r\n             length of time as may be deemed reasonable not less than\r\n             once a week for three weeks. The court, judge, clerk,\r\n             master or judge of probate shall also direct that a copy of\r\n             the summons be forthwith deposited in the post office\r\n             directed to the person to be served at his place of\r\n             residence, unless it appears that such residence is neither\r\n             known to the party making the application nor can, with\r\n             reasonable diligence, be ascertained by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-9-740 (Supp. 2013). Appellants assert it is unreasonable to\r\nexpect a newspaper in Beaufort County to be the newspaper most likely to give\r\nnotice to the Appellants, who reside in Pennsylvania. Appellants further assert the\r\nAssociation's failure to properly serve the summons and complaint violated\r\nAppellants' due process rights.\r\n\r\nThe Fingerhuts contend the purchaser (1) is deemed to be on notice of documents\r\ncontained in the court's file and (2) takes title to the property without notice of lien\r\nor defect. Citing Gladden v. Chapman, 106 S.C. 486, 91 S.E. 796, 797 (1917),\r\nthey argue the foreclosure purchaser is entitled to a presumption that the court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nconsidered and properly adjudicated issues of service. In Gladden, our supreme\r\ncourt held:  It must be presumed from the judgment rendered that the\r\n             Court considered and adjudicated the regularity and\r\n             sufficiency of each and every step in the proceedings\r\n             leading up to it, including the sufficiency of the\r\n             complaint, the issuance and service of process upon the\r\n             defendants, and the rights and interests of the parties to\r\n             the action under the allegations and evidence; and\r\n             although the conclusions with respect to those matters, or\r\n             any of them, might have been erroneous, so that they\r\n             would have been reversed on appeal, they do not make\r\n             the judgment void collaterally.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nWe find the master did not abuse his discretion in determining the Fingerhuts were\r\nbona fide purchasers. At the time of the foreclosure sale, the court file reflected\r\nAppellants had been served, were in default, had received notice, and were not in\r\nthe military. Furthermore, the Fingerhuts made actual payment of the purchase\r\nprice at the foreclosure sale and acquired title through the master-in-equity deed.\r\nFinally, the Fingerhuts had no notice of any title defect or other adverse claim, lien,\r\nor interest in the Property.\r\n\r\nWhile Appellants assert the master lacked jurisdiction to sell the Property because\r\nof defects in service, the Robinson court held the foreclosure purchaser was a bona\r\nfide purchaser for value without notice such that claims of defective service in the\r\nforeclosure action did not affect purchaser's title. 378 S.C. at 147, 662 S.E.2d at\r\n423. Although the Robinson court found the disputed affidavits of service were\r\nnot in the record and Appellants' arguments regarding improper publication were\r\nnot preserved, the court held:\r\n\r\n             Moreover, there is no evidence . . . [the foreclosure\r\n             purchaser] . . . had notice, constructive or otherwise, of\r\n             Appellants' claims that [the property owners] . . . were . .\r\n             . not properly served in the foreclosure action. Pursuant\r\n             to section 15-39-870, then, we hold [the foreclosure\r\n             purchaser]'s title is not affected by Appellants' claims of\r\n             defective service of process in the foreclosure action.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nId. at 146-47, 662 S.E.2d at 423. Thus, the Robinson court found foreclosure\r\nproceedings were res judicata as to bona fide purchasers without notice of\r\ndefective service claims.\r\n\r\nHere, as in Robinson, there is no evidence the Fingerhuts had any notice of\r\nAppellants' claims they were not properly served. Thus, the Fingerhuts were bona\r\nfide purchasers and their title to the Property was not affected by Appellants'\r\nclaims of defective service of process in the foreclosure action. In light of our\r\nfinding the Fingerhuts were bona fide purchasers without notice, we need not\r\naddress Appellants' argument regarding improper service. See Futch v. McAllister\r\nTowing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n(holding appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of\r\nprior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nII.   Foreclosure Sales Price\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in failing to set aside the foreclosure sale\r\nbecause the foreclosure sales price shocks the conscience. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"A judicial sale will be set aside when either: (1) the sale price 'is so gross as to\r\nshock the conscience[;]' or (2) the sale 'is accompanied by other circumstances\r\nwarranting the interference of the court.'\" Wells Fargo Bank, NA v. Turner, 378\r\nS.C. 147, 150, 662 S.E.2d 424, 425 (Ct. App. 2008) (alteration by court) (quoting\r\nPoole v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co., 174 S.C. 150, 157, 177 S.E. 24, 27\r\n(1934)). \"South Carolina has not established a bright line rule for what percentage\r\nthe sale value must be with respect to the actual value in order to shock the\r\nconscience of the court.\" E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Sanders, 373 S.C. 349, 359, 644\r\nS.E.2d 802, 807 (Ct. App. 2007). \"However, a search of South Carolina\r\njurisprudence reveals only when judicial sales are for less than ten percent of a\r\nproperty's actual value, have our courts consistently held the discrepancy to shock\r\nconscience of the court.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAppellants purchased the Property in 2001 for $201,500. The Fingerhuts\r\nsubsequently purchased the Property for $11,593.20 at the foreclosure sale in 2012.\r\nAppellants submitted an appraisal (Appellants' Appraisal) to the master which set\r\nthe Property's value at $140,000. This appraisal stated its intended use was to\r\nrebut the foreclosure sales price. The master found the Appellants' Appraisal used\r\nnon-comparable sales data from oceanfront lots and only cited Multiple Listing\r\nService listing data for interior lots as support for the valuation conclusion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nIn contrast, the Fingerhuts produced evidence showing the Property was sold for\r\n$10,000 in the 2010 Beaufort County Delinquent Tax Auction.2 Additionally, the\r\nFingerhuts submitted an appraisal (Fingerhuts' Appraisal) stating the Property was\r\nvalued at $17,000 as of January 19, 2012. The master found the Fingerhuts'\r\nAppraisal used comparable sales data, not listing data, from interior lots. The\r\nmaster noted the Fingerhuts' Appraisal was supported by an affidavit submitted by\r\nDavid Fingerhut affirming that the appraisal was ordered for the purpose of\r\nobtaining title insurance and not to support the value for purposes of this action.\r\n\r\nIn denying Appellants' motion to vacate the judicial sale, the master found the\r\nProperty would have to be worth more than $115,930 for the foreclosure sales\r\nprice to be less than 10% of the actual value. The master concluded the Fingerhuts'\r\nAppraisal and the 2010 tax sale data were more reliable than the valuation\r\ninformation provided by the Appellants. The master held the actual value of the\r\nProperty was far less than the $115,932 required to shock the conscience of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nWe find the master did not abuse his discretion in determining the foreclosure sales\r\nprice of the Property did not shock the conscience of the court. First, the master\r\napplied the correct legal standard in making his determination. The master noted\r\nthat our courts have consistently held that when foreclosure sales prices amount to\r\nless than ten percent of the actual value of the property, the discrepancy shocks the\r\nconscience of the court. Furthermore, the master's decision is supported by the\r\nevidence in the record. The master considered all of the evidence presented,\r\nincluding both appraisals, and found the evidence provided by the Fingerhuts was\r\nmore reliable.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find the master did not err in denying Appellants' motion to vacate/set aside a\r\nforeclosure sale.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   The Property was subsequently redeemed by Appellants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5263","title":"The Milton P.

Demetre Family Limited\r\nPartnership (Demetre) appeals an order of the Master-in-Equity (the master),\r\narguing the master erred in finding Demetre did not quiet title to certain property\r\non Folly Island. We affirm in part and vacate in part.\r\n\r\n      BACKGROUND FACTS1\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, Jefferson Construction Company platted and subdivided most of the\r\nIsland of Folly Beach, South Carolina. The 1920 plat was recorded in the\r\nCharleston County Register of Mesne Conveyance Office (RMC). In 1965, the\r\n1920 plat was redrawn due to deterioration, and in 1968, it was traced. The redraw\r\nadded parcels to the 1920 plat; however, the tracing appears to be identical to the\r\n1920 plat. The 1965 and 1968 plats were also recorded and share the same book\r\nand page number as the 1920 plat. The 1965 plat added parcels to the 1920 plat;\r\nhowever, the 1968 plat appears to be identical to the 1920 plat and does not include\r\nthe subject parcels, lots 209 and 210, on Indian Avenue, East.\r\n\r\nBetween approximately 1921 and 1926, the Folly Beach Improvement Company\r\n(FBIC) acquired the entire island of Folly Beach and mortgaged its complete\r\ninterest to Citizens and Southern National Bank of Savannah (C & S Bank). In\r\n1937, the FBIC sold the streets, avenues, and/or lanes in and upon Folly Island to\r\nthe Board of Township Commission of Folly Island for the use of the public.\r\n\r\nIn 1942, C & S Bank foreclosed on the mortgage, and Edward Seabrook, Sr.,\r\npurchased the land at a public auction. The deed conveyed the island to Seabrook\r\n\"[s]aving and excepting therefrom such lots and portions of land as have from time\r\nto time been conveyed to sundry parties by [FBIC] by deeds recorded in the RMC\r\nOffice for Charleston County.\" The 1942 deed also states the property conveyed is\r\n\"bounded . . . on the West by the Channel of Folly River and Folly Creek . . . as\r\ndelineated by the red line\" of an 1895 plat (the Tartus survey). The 1942 Deed also\r\nrefers to the 1920 plat. Seabrook, Sr., and his wife, Fannie, conveyed Seabrook's\r\nproperty to their son, Edward Seabrook, Jr., through the wills of Seabrook, Sr.,\r\nwho died in 1956, and of Fannie, who died in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Background Facts are substantially taken from the facts in The Milton P.\r\nDemetre Family Limited Partnership v. Beckmann, Op. No. 2009-UP-029 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed Jan. 14, 2009, withdrawn, substituted, and refiled, Apr. 21, 2009). We\r\nrefer to the April 2009 opinion as Demetre I.\r\n\nFrom Seabrook, Jr., in 2002, Demetre purchased lots 206 to 208 on Indian Avenue,\r\nEast for $45,000. Demetre purchased lots 202 to 205 in 2002 from another seller\r\nfor $475,000. Also in 2002, Demetre purchased \"[a]ny and all interest in\r\nmarshland or highland north of lot 201 Indian Avenue East\" for $5 from another\r\nseller.\r\n\r\nOn May 30, 2002, Demetre purchased from Seabrook, Jr., the \"portion of . . .\r\nroadway [on Indian Avenue] that is undeveloped and unpaved\" bordering lots 201\r\nto 205 for $10,000 by quitclaim deed. After contact with the City of Folly Beach,\r\nDemetre believed Seabrook owned the land.2 However, neither the mayor nor the\r\ncity administrator remembered notifying Demetre or its realtor that the City of\r\nFolly Beach did not own the land.\r\n\r\nOn December 6, 2002, Demetre brought an action against the City of Folly Beach\r\nto quiet title in the road located at the two-hundred block of East Indian Avenue on\r\nFolly Beach, South Carolina (\"Road\"), which borders other property Demetre owns\r\n(The \"Road\" case). Folly Beach asserted ownership of the Road. Emily Brown,\r\nintervenor, owns lot 204 on East Huron Avenue and has used the Road to access\r\nher property since January 30, 1986.\r\n\r\nOn January 23, 2004, Demetre purchased two riverfront lots, 209 and 210, on East\r\nIndian Avenue from Seabrook, Jr., for $23,700 by quitclaim deed. The deed\r\nreferences the 1920 plat.3 Lots 209 and 210 are shown on the 1965 plat, but they\r\ndo not appear on the 1920 plat or the Charleston County tax map.4 Both the 1920\r\nplat and the 1968 plat portray a portion of East Indian Avenue extending from lot\r\n201 to the northwest corner of lot 205. Beyond that, the plats portray the land as\r\nmarshland.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Demetre's realtor, Keith McCann, sent Demetre a letter stating the Mayor and \n\r\nCity Administrator had determined the City of Folly Beach did not own the road \n\r\nand that Seabrook did. \n\r\n3 The quitclaim deed also states, \"portions of the roadways named Indian Avenue, \n\r\nEast and Third Street, East conveyed by this deed are unimproved, undeveloped, \n\r\nunpaved, undedicated, and abandoned; and, now become[] part of a private fifty \n\r\n(50) foot wide roadway owned by [Demetre] . . . as shown on the [1920] Plat that\r\nis adjacent to and borders on Lot Numbers [201-210] Indian Avenue, East.\"\r\n4 Demetre alleged he paid taxes on the property, including the roads and\r\nmarshland.\r\n\nIn a separate action, on October 7, 2005, Demetre brought an action against Annie\r\nCrowley, Raymond Crowley, Donald Crowley, Harris Crowley, Jr., and Annie\r\nAtkinson (the \"Crowleys\"), and Harry and Patricia Beckmann (the \"Beckmanns\")\r\nfor declaratory judgment and to quiet title to lots 209 and 210 where the Crowleys\r\nand Beckmanns have docks. The Crowleys and Beckmanns were permitted to\r\nintervene in the Road case because their lots abut East Indian Avenue. The\r\nCrowleys purchased lot 210, East Huron Avenue, on September 1, 1964, and the\r\nBeckmanns purchased lot 209, East Huron Avenue, on April 27, 1972. Both of the\r\ndeeds referenced the 1920 plat, which shows no lots between their lots and the\r\nmarsh abutting the river. The Crowleys and Beckmanns believed they owned all\r\nof the property from their homes to the marsh. Harry Beckmann testified he\r\nbelieved the State owned everything from his property line to the Folly River. In\r\n1988, both the Crowleys and the Beckmanns applied for permits from the South\r\nCarolina Coastal Council (Council) to construct docks from their lots to the Folly\r\nRiver across East Indian Avenue lots 209 and 210. The Council granted the\r\npermits, and the docks were constructed.5\r\n\r\nAfter reference to the master and consolidation, the cases were tried on December\r\n12, 2006. On March 2, 2007, the master issued the \"Road\" Order, finding the Road\r\nwas dedicated to the public and the City of Folly Beach owned the Road. On\r\nMarch 26, 2007, the master issued the \"Dock\" Order, ruling in favor of the dock\r\nowners on all grounds. The master denied Demetre's post-trial motions to\r\nreconsider. Demetre timely appealed both orders to this court, and we\r\nconsolidated the appeals. This court heard the matter, Demetre I, on November 6,\r\n2008, and issued its refiled opinion on April 21, 2009.6\r\n\r\nIn Demetre I, this court separated the appeal into \"The Road Case\" and \"The Dock\r\nCase.\" As to the Road Case, the court explained the 1937 deed dedicated all\r\nstreets, avenues, and/or lanes to Folly Beach. The court noted the 1920 plat, which\r\nwas referenced in Demetre's deeds, showed East Indian Avenue extending from lot\r\n201 to the northwest corner of lot 205. The court affirmed the master's finding that\r\nthe Road was dedicated to Folly Beach, and it accepted the dedication. The court\r\nalso affirmed the master's finding that Demetre did not satisfy the elements of\r\n\r\n\r\n5 The docks were destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and they were rebuilt in \n\r\napproximately 1990.\n\r\n6 The original opinion in Demetre I was filed January 14, 2009. The original \n\r\nopinion was withdrawn, substituted, and refiled April 21, 2009.\n\r\n\nequitable estoppel. In its conclusion, the court stated: \"[W]e affirm the master's . . .\r\norder finding Folly Beach owns East Indian Avenue . . . .\"\r\n\r\nAs to the Dock Case, this court found the following:\r\n\r\n             Demetre sought a declaration that [it] owns all the\r\n             property between the Crowleys' and the Beckmanns' lots\r\n             and the mean high water mark, and [it] sought to quiet\r\n             any defects in [its] title to the land. The master did not\r\n             rule on either request and only held the Crowleys and the\r\n             Beckmanns believed the State owned the land when they\r\n             applied for their dock permits, which does not resolve the\r\n             question of actual ownership. Demetre does not dispute\r\n             the presumption that the State holds in trust for public\r\n             purposes the property below the mean high water mark.\r\n             Therefore, because the master failed to rule on Demetre's\r\n             requests for a declaration of ownership and to quiet title\r\n             to the portions of the lots above the high water mark, we\r\n             remand this case to the master for a determination on this\r\n             issue.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court denied Demetre's petition for certiorari on April 8, 2010.\r\n\r\nII. FACTS PERTAINING TO THIS APPEAL\r\n\r\nOn remand, after Demetre's written request, the master heard arguments without\r\nreceiving additional evidence. Demetre initally argued the issue on remand was\r\nsettled because the parties stipulated at trial to record title. The Crowleys and\r\nBeckmanns (Respondents) argued the stipulation was merely \"that the records\r\nwere what the records were, and we simply were stipulating that if you went down\r\nto the [RMC] . . . that this is what you would find. There were deeds into\r\n[Demetre]. . . . But what those deeds mean, that's a whole 'nother story. We\r\ncertainly are not stipulating to any good title . . . .\"\r\n\r\nDemetre also argued Respondents' affirmative defenses were no longer viable\r\nbecause they had \"been either abandoned or lost at the trial level and/or overruled\r\nby the Court of Appeals.\" Demetre argued the defenses were either not ruled upon;\r\nnot appealed; waived; and/or law of the case. Respondents disputed their\r\naffirmative defenses were not viable. Respondents claimed entitlement to the\r\n\ndefenses of the forty-year statutory presumption of a grant; the twenty-year\r\ncommon law presumption of a grant; adverse possession; and laches.\r\n\r\nOn the merits, the parties argued the issues as \"Chain of Title\" and \"Accretion.\"\r\nDemetre argued the deeds described the footage of the Respondents' lots as 150\r\nfeet from East Huron Avenue and did not \"say anything about going an inch\r\nfurther than 150 feet\" and did not mention East Indian Avenue. Demetre also\r\nargued Respondents' permit applications, signed under oath, claimed 150 feet from\r\nHuron Avenue. Demetre relied on his chain of title, including the quitclaim deed,\r\nfor property north of lots 209 and 210 to the Folly River and the \"unpaved roadway\r\nbordering 201 through 210 and Third Street roadway adjacent to Lot 210 East\r\nIndian.\"\r\n\r\nRespondents argued any property not owned by the State from their lots to the\r\nFolly River belongs to them because their deeds reference the 1920 plat showing\r\nnothing behind their lots except marshland, and Demetre's alleged lots situated\r\nbetween Respondents' lots and the marshland were not effectively transferred by\r\nthe quitclaim deed.\r\n\r\nDemetre next argued the only evidence of true delineation was in a 2005 plat\r\n(referred to by the parties as the Kennerty Topograpic Survey) and the 1965 plat.\r\nDemetre argued the 1920 plat did not indicate the mean high water mark, and its\r\ndesignation of \"marshland\" included low and high land. Demetre argued because\r\nthe 1965 plat indicates the lots, and Respondents stipulated to record title, then it\r\npurchased the lots by its quitclaim deed. Further, Demetre argued it was entitled to\r\nquiet title because the 1965 plat is recorded at the same location, page 158 of Plat\r\nBook C, as the 1920 plat.\r\n\r\nAs to the accretion argument, Respondents maintained the State owned the marsh,\r\nand any accretion belonged to them as owners of the properties adjacent to the\r\nmarsh. Demetre maintained there was no evidence of accretion. Demetre also\r\nargued Respondents' dock permit applications indicated Respondents were not\r\nclaiming accretion. Demetre argued the attachments to the permit applications\r\nshowed high marshland beyond the 150 feet that Respondents did not claim. The\r\npermit applications were for 700 foot docks \"to Folly River.\"\r\n\r\nThe master questioned if the State needed to be a party to the action. Demetre and\r\nRespondents argued the issue was related to land above the high water mark;\r\ntherefore, the State was not required to be a party.\r\n\nBy order filed January 13, 2012, the master first determined \"any challenge to\r\nownership of this marshland must be pursued in an action against the State . . . .\"\r\nThe master, after noting the parties did not want to add the State as a party,\r\nconcluded, \"this court disagrees [because] the 'high marsh' is contained within the\r\narea previously denoted as Marshland.\" The master determined the issue was the\r\n\"highland contained within what was formerly marshland\" and looked to the chain\r\nof title, finding although the 2005 Kennerty plat delineates both high and low\r\nmarsh, the 1920 plat shows the property in question to be \"Marshlands.\" The\r\nmaster further found only the 1965 plat shows lots located at the area in dispute.\r\nThus, the master found the \"1965 plat is incorrect and, therefore, cannot serve as a\r\nbasis for the creation of new lots on Folly Beach.\" The master found the lots \"did\r\nnot exist\" at the time of the conveyance to Seabrook, Sr. The master also found,\r\n\"The subsequent plat from 1968 also shows the area in question to be marshland. I\r\nfind [the] 1968 plat evidently intended to correct the 1965 plat error.\"\r\n\r\nThe master found the 19427 deed to Seabrook, Sr., did not include the lots, stating\r\n\"[t]his fact was apparently known to [Seabrook, Jr.,] who determined he would\r\nonly convey the lots in question to [Demetre] by Quitclaim deed in 2004,\" which\r\nthe master recognized \"is not a representation of good and valid title. . . .\" The\r\nmaster concluded Respondents' docks had been in place for many years prior to\r\nDemetre's purchase of the property, and Demetre's purchase was done \"with full\r\nknowledge and understanding that [Respondents] had a vested property interest,\r\ngranted under license from the [S]tate, to the docks which run from in front of their\r\nproperty, commencing in . . . Indian Avenue, and running to the Folly River.\"\r\n\r\nThe master also found the following,\r\n\r\n             [W]hile the oldest diagram submitted to the court in this\r\n             litigation was an 1895 engineer's \"Map of Folly Island,\"\r\n             this court concludes, based upon Query[v. Burgess, 371\r\n             S.C. 407, 639 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 2006)], that the 1786\r\n             plat is the genesis for title to all marshland located on\r\n             Folly Island – this issue has previously been decided by\r\n             Query and is adverse to the position taken by either party\r\n             in this litigation. At a minimum, the parties should\r\n\r\n7The master's reference to the \"Master's Deed of January 5, 1943\" to Seabrook,\r\nSr., refers to the 1942 deed, which was recorded January 5, 1943.\r\n\n             present the full history of title to the court for a complete\r\n             hearing.\r\n\r\n             The purpose of the remand order was to determine\r\n             [Demetre's] interest in the property and quiet title in\r\n             [Demetre] if applicable. I find under the facts presented\r\n             here, as between these parties, that [Demetre] has not\r\n             prevailed under its burden of proof. I further find that\r\n             there is no basis to quiet title, in Demetre, based on\r\n             Demetre's claim of title to the land.\r\n\r\nThe master summarized the findings of fact: (1) Demetre's deeds refer to the 1920\r\nplat; (2) the 1920 plat does not show Demetre's lots; therefore, they do not exist;\r\n(3) Demetre can only own what was deeded in the 1920 plat, which is described as\r\nmarshland; (4) Respondents' deeds show East Indian Avenue as their riverward\r\nboundary; (5) any highland riverward of Respondents' lots was contained within\r\nthe designation of \"Marshland\" in the 1920 plat; (6) the State is the owner of the\r\nland seaward of Respondents' lots; and (7) Demetre is not entitled to quiet title.\r\nThe master ruled against Respondents on their affirmative defenses. The master\r\nconcluded: \"[Demetre] does not own any portion of the highland between\r\n[Respondents'] lots and the mean high water mark on lots 209 and 210, East Indian\r\nAvenue; [and Demetre] is not entitled to have title quieted in its name.\" Demetre\r\nmoved for reconsideration, which the master denied, finding the 1786 plat\r\ndispositive. This appeal followed.\r\n                          8\r\nIII.   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       The Stipulation Issue9\r\n1.\r\n\r\nDemetre argues the master erred by disregarding Respondents' stipulation to record\r\ntitle. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 We consolidate Demetre's sixteen arguments into four issues: (1) the stipulation;\r\n(2) Respondents' affirmative defenses; (3) the master's findings as to the State or \n\r\nRespondents' ownership in the property; and (4) the master's finding Demetre \n\r\nfailed in its burden of proof to quiet title.\n\r\n9 Demetre's Issue 4. \n\r\n\nDuring the trial,10 the parties retired to the master's chambers to discuss the parties'\r\nstipulations. After returning to the courtroom, the parties entered the following\r\nstipulation on the record:\r\n\r\n             It is stipulated by and between attorneys for the parties\r\n             that record title for [Demetre] has been stipulated to.\r\n\r\n                                          ....\r\n\r\n             The chain of title for Lot 210 Huron Avenue East into the\r\n             Crowleys has been stipulated to.\r\n\r\n             And the chain of title to the Beckmanns to Lot 209 Huron\r\n             Avenue East has been stipulated to.\r\n\r\n             All of those have been agreed by counsel that they are\r\n             stipulated to, as far as record title.\r\n\r\nDuring the hearing, Demetre argued entitlement to quiet title because the parties\r\nstipulated at trial to record title. Respondents argued the stipulation was merely\r\nthat \"the records were what the records were, and we simply were stipulating that if\r\nyou went down to the [RMC] . . . that this is what you would find. There were\r\ndeeds into [Demetre]. . . . But what those deeds mean, that's a whole 'nother story.\r\nWe certainly are not stipulating to any good title . . . .\" The master found the\r\nstipulations were \"to how each got their title.\"\r\n\r\n\"A stipulation is an agreement, admission or concession made in judicial\r\nproceedings by the parties thereto or their attorneys.\" Kirkland v. Allcraft Steel\r\nCo., 329 S.C. 389, 392, 496 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1998). \"Stipulations, of course, are\r\nbinding upon those who make them.\" Id. \"The court must construe [a stipulation]\r\nlike a contract, i.e., interpret it in a manner consistent with the parties' intentions.\"\r\nPorter v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 333 S.C. 12, 30, 507 S.E.2d 328, 337 (1998).\r\nThe interpretation of a stipulation is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. See id.\r\nat 31, 507 S.E.2d at 337 (\"Whether to abrogate the stipulation is addressed to the\r\n\r\n\r\n10References to the trial refer to the trial prior to the first appeal in Demetre I;\r\nreferences to the hearing refer to the post-remand hearing.\r\n\nsound discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court will not interfere with\r\nthat decision except when there is a manifest abuse of discretion.\").\r\n\r\nWe conclude the master properly interpreted the meaning of the stipulation at issue\r\nin this case. The question litigated was not whether Demetre held record title to\r\nthe property; rather, the question litigated was whether the record title validly\r\nconveyed the subject property as to quiet title in Demetre. Accordingly, we affirm\r\nthe master's interpretation of the stipulations.11\r\n\r\n      Respondents' Affirmative Defenses12\r\n2.\r\n\r\nDemetre argues the master erred in ruling on the affirmative defenses, claiming the\r\ncourt's action in Demetre I rendered the affirmative defenses \"law of the case.\" It\r\nalso argues the master should have cited to authority in ruling against Respondents\r\non their affirmative defenses. We find no reversible error.\r\n\r\nDuring the hearing, Demetre argued Respondents' affirmative defenses were no\r\nlonger viable because they had \"been either abandoned or lost at the trial level\r\nand/or overruled by the Court of Appeals.\" Demetre argued the defenses were\r\neither not ruled upon, not appealed, waived, and/or law of the case. Respondents\r\nasserted their affirmative defenses were viable. The master ruled against\r\nRespondents on its affirmative defenses. We find no prejudice to Demetre arising\r\nfrom the master's rulings against Respondents on their affirmative defenses; thus,\r\nany error is not reversible. See Visual Graphics Leasing Corp. v. Lucia, 311 S.C.\r\n484, 489, 429 S.E.2d 839, 841 (Ct. App. 1993) (\"An error is not reversible unless it\r\nis material and prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant.\").\r\n\r\nFinally, Demetre argues the master erred in failing to quiet title in Demetre\r\nbecause the master ruled against Respondents' affirmative defenses. Demetre\r\nclaims, without citation to authority, \"Where there are no affirmative defenses,\r\nrecord title is good.\" Respondents argue a stipulation to record title is not a\r\nstipulation to good title. Respondents maintain Demetre had the burden to prove\r\ngood title. \"In an action to quiet title, the plaintiff must recover on the strength of\r\nhis own title, not on the alleged weakness of the defendant's title.\" Hoogenboom v.\r\n\r\n11 We find no merit to Demetre's summary argument that it is entitled to quiet title \n\r\nbecause it paid property taxes on the property at issue. The citations to the record \n\r\ndo not support Demetre's argument. \n\r\n12 Demetre's issues 5, 6, and 15. \n\r\n\nCity of Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 313, 433 S.E.2d 875, 880 (Ct. App. 1992) (citations\r\nomitted). We find no merit to Demetre's claim of automatic vesting of title in its\r\naction to quiet title based on Respondents' failure to prove its affirmative defenses.\r\n\r\n         The Master's Findings Granting Property Interests to Others13\r\n3.\r\n\r\nDemetre argues the master erred in the following: (1) finding the State was a\r\nnecessary party; (2) holding the State owns the subject property above the mean\r\nhigh water mark; (3) concluding Respondents have vested property interests in\r\ntheir docks; (4) finding the State owns any accreted highland; (5) finding the State\r\nowns the land seaward of Respondents' lots because the subject property was\r\nwithin the designation of \"Marshland\" on the 1920 plat of Folly Island; (6) finding\r\nthe 1965 plat was \"incorrect\" and the 1968 plat corrected the error; and (7) finding\r\nthe State owns the undeveloped portion of the roadway riverward of Respondents'\r\nlots when Demetre I affirmed only the Town's ownership to the end of the\r\nnortheast corner of Lot 205. As to all findings regarding the necessity of the State\r\nas a party, the State or Respondents' interests in the subject property, and the\r\ninterpretation of all plats other than as applied to the issue of Demetre's ability to\r\nquiet title in Lots 209 and 210, we agree and vacate those portions of the order on\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\"[A] trial court has no authority to exceed the mandate of the appellate court on\r\nremand.\" S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 250, 551 S.E.2d 274,\r\n279 (Ct. App. 2001). \"The mandate of the appellate court is jurisdictional. The\r\ntrial court has a duty to follow the appellate court's directions.\" Prince v. Beaufort\r\nMem'l Hosp., 392 S.C. 599, 605, 709 S.E.2d 122, 125 (Ct. App. 2011) (citation\r\nomitted); see Basnight, 346 S.C. at 250-51, 551 S.E.2d at 279 (noting \"[o]nce a\r\nmandate is issued from an appellate court to a trial court, the trial court 'is vested\r\nwith jurisdiction only to the extent conferred by the appellate court's opinion and\r\nmandate'\" (quoting 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review § 784, at 453 (1995))).\r\n\r\nThe mandate in Demetre I directed the master to \"rule on Demetre's requests for a\r\ndeclaration of ownership and to quiet title to the portions of the lots above the high\r\nwater mark.\" To the extent the master exceeded the mandate by finding the State\r\nwas a necessary party, by finding any property interest in the State or Respondents,\r\nby finding the 1965 plat was \"incorrect,\" and by determining the location of the\r\nmean high water mark, we vacate that portion of the order.\r\n\r\n13   Demetre's issues 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 16.\r\n\n      Demetre's Failure to Quiet Title in Lots 209 and 21014\r\n4.\r\n\r\nDemetre argues the master erred in the following: (1) relying on the 1920 plat to\r\ndetermine Demetre's claim; (2) finding its predecessor in interest, Folly Beach\r\nCorporation, took title based on the 1920 plat, rather than the 1895 Tartus Map\r\nreferenced in the deed to Folly Beach Corporation;15 (3) finding the 1786,16 1895,\r\nand 1920 plats are more precise than the 2005 Kennerty Topographic Survey,\r\nwhich is the only plat that shows the location of the mean high water mark; (4)\r\nfinding Lots 209 and 210 \"do not exist\" because they are not shown on the 1920\r\nplat;17 and (5) finding Seabrook, Jr., believed he did not have title to the property.\r\n\r\nDemetre entered an exhibit indicating the following chain of title:\r\n\r\n          –\t Deed from Folly Island Company to Folly Beach\r\n             Corporation recorded November 18, 1919, referring to\r\n             the 1895 Tartus Map;\r\n\r\n          –\t Deed and quitclaim deed from Alexander family\r\n             members to Folly Beach Corporation recorded January\r\n             17, 1921, referring to an 1863 Parker survey;18\r\n\r\n\r\n14 Demetre's issues 1, 10, 11, 12, and 14.\r\n15 This issue also asserts error in the master's finding that the State owns the\r\nproperty, which we vacate in the previous section. To the extent the master erred\r\nin finding the deed referenced the 1920 plat rather than the 1895 plat, we find no\r\nprejudice because neither plat depicts the lots Demetre claims.\r\n16 The 1786 plat is referred to in Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C. 407, 412, 639 S.E.2d\r\n455, 457 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"The plat roughly delineates Folly Island. The plat\r\ncontains the bare bones of a survey and is neither precise nor detailed.\").\r\n17 We find no merit to Demetre's claim that the master's finding–that lots 209 and\r\n210 on Indian Avenue East do not exist–conflicts with the remand mandate in\r\nDemetre I. The mandate directed the master to rule on Demetre's requests for a\r\ndeclaration of ownership and to quiet title to the portions of the lots above the high\r\nwater mark. We read the mandate as requiring the master to determine whether\r\nDemetre proved the right to quiet title. We do not read, as argued by Demetre, a\r\ndirective to determine who owns the subject property.\r\n18 Neither Demetre nor the master relied on the 1863 Parker survey.\r\n\n          –\t Deed except for lots already conveyed from Folly Beach\r\n             Corporation to Folly Beach Improvement Company\r\n             recorded January 20, 1926, referring to the 1863 Parker\r\n             survey and February and May 1920 plats;\r\n\r\n          –\t 1942 master's deed to Seabrook, Sr., except for lots \n\r\n             already conveyed, recorded January 5, 1943; \n\r\n\r\n          –\t Seabrook, Sr., to Seabrook, Jr., by will;\r\n\r\n          –\t Quitclaim deed from Seabrook, Jr., to Demetre of lots\r\n             209 and 210 Indian Avenue, East, including the roadway,\r\n             referring to February 1920 plat.\r\n\r\nThus, Demetre's chain of title references the 1863 survey, the 1895 Tartus plat, and\r\nthe 1920 plat. The deed to Demetre references only the 1920 plat.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial, when asked why he only paid $23,000 for the lots, Milton\r\nDemetre testified Seabrook, Jr., told him to make him an offer. Mr. Demetre\r\ncontinued, \"He could have sold it for $5 and a deed. I don't know.\" When asked\r\nwhy he offered Seabrook, Jr., $23,000, Mr. Demetre responded, \"He said make\r\nhim an offer, and that's what I did.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Demetre's deeds, the master found the following: (1) Demetre's deeds refer to\r\nthe 1920 plat; (2) the 1920 plat does not show Demetre's lots; therefore, they do\r\nnot exist; (3) Demetre can only own what was deeded by reference to the 1920\r\nplat, which is described as marshland; and (4) Demetre is not entitled to quiet title.\r\nAfter finding the lots did \"not exist as legal lots today,\" the master found \"[t]his . . .\r\nwas apparently known to [Seabrook, Jr.,] who determined he would only convey\r\nthe lots in question to [Demetre] by [q]uitclaim deed.\" The master further found\r\nSeabrook, Jr. \"was willing (for a price) to grant whatever title he may have had in\r\nthis property–whether he had any interest in this property or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"In an action to quiet title, the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own\r\ntitle, not on the alleged weakness of the defendant's title.\" Hoogenboom, 315 S.C.\r\nat 313, 433 S.E.2d at 880. \"One claiming title by deed has no greater title than the\r\noriginal grantor in the chain of title upon which he relies.\" Id. at 313, 433 S.E.2d\r\nat 880-81 (citing Belue v.

Code Ann. § 27-7-20\r\n(2007) (\"[T]his section shall be so construed as not to oblige any person to insert\r\nthe clause of warranty or to restrain him from inserting any other clause in\r\nconveyances, as may be deemed proper and advisable by the purchaser and seller,\r\nor to invalidate the forms formerly in use within this State.\")). However, \"[a]\r\nquitclaim deed does not guarantee the quality of title, but only conveys that which\r\nthe grantor may lawfully convey.\" Mulherin-Howell v.

Although the supreme court in Martin was\r\ndiscussing a purchaser whose seller took title under a quitclaim deed, we find the\r\nfollowing language instructive:\r\n\r\n            The authorities are conflicting as to whether a person can\r\n            interpose the defense of purchaser for valuable\r\n            consideration without notice, when he derives his title\r\n            from one holding under a mere quitclaim deed.

Utsey, 34 S.C. 559, 571, 13 S.E. 848,\r\n            the Court says: \"Some of the cases go so far as to hold\r\n            that one who purchases from another, holding under a\r\n            quitclaim deed, cannot, by reason of that fact, claim to be\r\n            a purchaser without notice. See 2 Pom. Eq. Jur., sec.\r\n            753, where the cases both pro and con are cited in a note.\r\n            . . . The reason given is, that such a purchaser buys no\r\n            more than what his grantor can lawfully convey; to\r\n            which, we think, might be added, that the fact that the\r\n\n             grantor is unwilling to warrant the title, tends at least to\r\n             show that there is some defect in the title, known to or\r\n             apprehended by him, and, therefore, the purchaser is put\r\n             upon inquiry. While we are not prepared at present to go\r\n             to the full extent to which the doctrine has been carried\r\n             by some of the cases, yet we are satisfied that the fact\r\n             that the immediate grantor of the purchaser holds under a\r\n             quitclaim deed, is a circumstance well calculated to\r\n             excite inquiry, which, if not pursued properly, will affect\r\n             the purchaser with notice of every fact which such\r\n             inquiry, pursued with due diligence, would disclose . . . .\r\n\r\nMartin, 71 S.C. at 76-77, 50 S.E. at 674.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the master's conclusion that Demetre failed in his burden of proving\r\ntitle to Lots 209 and 210. Neither the 1920 plat nor the 1895 Tartus plat depict the\r\nlots. Demetre acknowledged at the remand hearing that the lots did not exist as\r\nlots on the 1920 plat. Demetre relies on the 2005 Kennerty plat and the 1965 plat,\r\nwhich are not in his chain of title and were not in existence at the time the property\r\nwas last deeded prior to the quitclaim deed to Demetre. Furthermore, as to the\r\nmaster's finding that Seabrook, Jr., believed that he did not have title, we find\r\nevidence in the record to support the master's finding. See Estate of Tenney v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 100, 105, 712 S.E.2d 395, 397 (2011)\r\n(stating a master's factual findings in an action to quiet title will be affirmed by an\r\nappellate court if there is any evidence in the record reasonably supporting the\r\nfindings). We find Demetre has failed to meet his burden of proving title to lots\r\n209 and 210. Accordingly, we affirm the master's order to the extent it found\r\nDemetre failed to quiet title in lots 209 and 210.\r\n\r\nIV.          CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe affirm the master's order regarding the stipulation, Respondents' affirmative\r\ndefenses, and Demetre's failure to quiet title in lots 209 and 210. To the extent the\r\nmaster exceeded the mandate by finding the State was a necessary party, by\r\nfinding any property interest in the State or Respondents, by finding the 1965 plat\r\nwas \"incorrect,\" and by determining the location of the mean high water mark, we\r\nvacate the order.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5264","title":"Solanki v.

It also appeals the trial court's denial\r\n\nof its post-trial motions for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV) and for\r\nthe reversal or reduction of punitive damages. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn November 27, 2009, \"Black Friday,\" the Solankis went shopping at the Wal-\r\nMart in Boiling Springs, South Carolina. After they selected their items, Mr.\r\nSolanki went to the self-checkout line; however, he experienced a problem with the\r\nregister. Ryan Smalls, a Wal-Mart employee, attempted to help Mr. Solanki.\r\nWhen Smalls could not get the self-checkout machine to operate correctly, Smalls\r\ntook Mr. Solanki to a cashier-assisted register. There were also problems with that\r\nregister. During the transaction, Mr. Solanki handed Smalls his debit card and\r\nidentification. Smalls manually stenciled Mr. Solanki's debit card, which he used\r\nas a credit card because Mr. Solanki could not remember his pin number.\r\nHowever, the credit card information of Robin Martin was hand keyed into the\r\nregister during this transaction. A receipt with Martin's credit card information\r\nwas signed by Mr. Solanki and $144.70 was charged to her account. The Solankis\r\nleft the store unaware of the mistake.\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 2009, Martin notified the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office her\r\ncredit card had been stolen and two unauthorized charges were on her account,\r\nincluding Mr. Solanki's purchase at Wal-Mart. Deputy Gina Cashion was assigned\r\nto the case. She requested Wal-Mart provide her with the video surveillance and\r\nreceipts for the date and time of the unauthorized charges. Wal-Mart found one\r\ntransaction for that date in the amount of $144.70. It provided Deputy Cashion\r\nwith video surveillance of the transaction, a copy of the stenciled impression of\r\nMr. Solanki's debit card, the itemized receipt, and the store's copy of the receipt\r\nshowing Martin's credit card information with Mr. Solanki's signature.\r\n\r\nDeputy Cashion tried to contact Mr. Solanki but was unsuccessful. Based on the\r\ninformation at her disposal, she obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Solanki. He was\r\narrested in Georgia in April 2010 and spent six nights in jail before he was\r\ntransported to South Carolina where he posted bail. He was indicted on financial\r\ntransaction card theft and financial transaction card fraud, but the indictments were\r\ndismissed on August 24, 2010.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Solanki filed a complaint against Wal-Mart and the Sheriff's Office\r\nfor (1) negligence, (2) gross negligence and recklessness, (3) false imprisonment,\r\n(4) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (5) defamation and defamation per\r\n\nse, (6) assault, (7) battery, (8) malicious prosecution, and (9) loss of consortium.1\r\nThe trial court directed a verdict for Wal-Mart on all causes of action except\r\nnegligence and gross negligence. The jury returned a verdict against Wal-Mart for\r\nnegligence. They awarded Mr. Solanki $50,000 in actual damages and $225,000\r\nin punitive damages against Wal-Mart. They also found Mr. Solanki was\r\ncomparatively negligent in the amount of 25%. Wal-Mart filed post-trial motions\r\nfor JNOV, new trial nisi remittitur, reversal or reduction of punitive damages, or\r\nnew trial pursuant to the Thirteenth Juror Doctrine. The trial court denied all of\r\nWal-Mart's motions. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Punitive Damages\r\n\r\nWal-Mart asserts the Solankis presented insufficient evidence to submit the issue\r\nof punitive damages to the jury. Specifically, Wal-Mart maintains the Solankis\r\npresented no evidence at trial its actions were willful, wanton, or reckless. Instead,\r\nit argues this is a case of simple negligence, which is not subject to punitive\r\ndamages. Furthermore, Wal-Mart contends the trial court erred in applying the\r\ngross negligence standard without first making a finding of willful, wanton, or\r\nreckless misconduct before submission to the jury.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Wal-Mart argues the Solankis asserted a heightened duty of care for\r\nWal-Mart beyond the duty a merchant owes to its customers. Wal-Mart maintains\r\nit was not under a heightened duty of care, and under the general duty of care a\r\nmerchant owes to a customer, no facts were presented at trial that demonstrated\r\nWal-Mart breached its duty. Wal-Mart contends the Solankis presented no\r\nevidence showing it deviated from industry standards by handing over the evidence\r\nin its possession to the Sheriff's Office without conducting its own investigation.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n\"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of the\r\nappellate court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual\r\nfinding by the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses no\r\nevidence that reasonably supports the jury's findings.\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1,\r\n\r\n1 The trial court granted a directed verdict on all claims against the Sheriff's Office\r\nexcept for the claims of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. The jury\r\nreturned a verdict in favor of the Sheriff's Office on both claims.\r\n\n18, 640 S.E.2d 486, 495 (Ct. App. 2006). According to Rule 220(c), SCACR, an\r\nappellate court may affirm the lower court's judgment for any reason appearing in\r\nthe record on appeal. I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 417, 526\r\nS.E.2d 716, 722 (2000).\r\n\r\n             The standard of review as regards the refusal to grant a\r\n             directed verdict is well established: In ruling on motions\r\n             for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required\r\n             to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably\r\n             can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the\r\n             party opposing the motions and to deny the motions\r\n             where either the evidence yields more than one inference\r\n             or its inference is in doubt. The trial court can only be\r\n             reversed by this [c]ourt when there is not evidence to\r\n             support the ruling below.\r\n\r\nCreech v. S.C. Wildlife & Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 28-29, 491 S.E.2d 571,\r\n573 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n\"The purposes of punitive damages are to punish the wrongdoer and deter the\r\nwrongdoer and others from engaging in similar reckless, willful, wanton, or\r\nmalicious conduct in the future.\" Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d\r\n528, 533 (2000). \"Punitive damages also serve to vindicate a private right of the\r\ninjured party by requiring the wrongdoer to pay money to the injured party.\" Id. at\r\n378-79, 539 S.E.2d at 533.\r\n\r\nTo receive an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving\r\nby clear and convincing evidence the defendant's misconduct was willful, wanton,\r\nor in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights. Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs.,\r\nInc., 358 S.C. 298, 313, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004). \"A conscious\r\nfailure to exercise due care constitutes willfulness.\" McCourt ex rel. McCourt v.\r\nAbernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 308, 457 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1995). The issue of punitive\r\ndamages must be submitted to the jury if more than one reasonable inference can\r\nbe drawn from the evidence as to whether the defendant's behavior was reckless,\r\nwillful, or wanton. Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 398, 321 S.E.2d 40, 43\r\n(1984).      In light of Gamble [v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111-12,\r\n             406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991)], there are now three stages\r\n             in this state to a trial court's review of punitive damages.\r\n\n             First, the court must determine whether the defendant's\r\n             conduct rises to the level of culpability warranting a\r\n             punitive damage award. If not, the issue of punitive\r\n             damages may not be submitted to the jury. If so, the jury\r\n             should be adequately instructed to assess an appropriate\r\n             amount of damages. Second, the trial judge must\r\n             conduct a post-trial Gamble review to ensure that the\r\n             award does not deprive the defendant of due process. If\r\n             the award is determined to violate the defendant's due\r\n             process rights, then the trial court must either grant a new\r\n             trial absolute, or a new trial nisi remittitur. If the award\r\n             is determined not to violate the defendant's due process\r\n             rights, then the trial court reaches the third inquiry, to\r\n             wit, whether, in the exercise of its discretion, it finds the\r\n             award excessive or inadequate.\r\n\r\nS.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love Chevrolet, Inc., 324 S.C. 149, 154, 478\r\nS.E.2d 57, 59 (1996).\r\n\r\nNegligence is the failure to exercise due care, while gross negligence is the failure\r\nto exercise slight care. Clyburn v. Sumter Cnty. Sch. Dist. # 17, 317 S.C. 50, 53,\r\n451 S.E.2d 885, 887 (1994). \"While punitive damages are recoverable for\r\nnegligence so gross or reckless of consequences as to imply or to assume the\r\nnature of wantonness, willfulness or recklessness, yet they are not awarded in this\r\nstate for mere gross negligence.\" Bell v. Atl. Coast Line R. Co., 202 S.C. 160, 171,\r\n24 S.E.2d 177, 182 (1943). \"If a person of ordinary reason and prudence would\r\nhave been conscious of the probability of resulting injury, the law says the person\r\nis reckless or willful and wanton, all of which have the same meaning- the\r\nconscious failure to exercise due care.\" Berberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 287, 709\r\nS.E.2d 607, 612 (2011).\r\n\r\nGross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question of law and fact. Clyburn, 317 S.C.\r\nat 53, 451 S.E.2d at 887. \"When the evidence supports but one reasonable\r\ninference, it is solely a question of law for [the] court, otherwise it is an issue best\r\nresolved by the jury. . . . In most cases, gross negligence is a factually controlled\r\nconcept whose determination best rests with the jury.\" Madison ex rel. Bryant v.\r\nBabcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 144, 638 S.E.2d 650, 661 (2006). \"[A] merchant\r\nis not an insurer of the safety of his customer but owes them only the duty of\r\nexercising ordinary care to keep the premises in reasonably safe condition.\"\r\nPennington v. Zayre Corp., 252 S.C. 176, 178, 165 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1969).\r\n\nThe record contains no evidence the trial court imposed a heightened duty of care\r\non Wal-Mart. At trial, the Solankis' attorney discussed his own belief that Wal-\r\nMart should be subject to a heightened duty; however, the record does not indicate\r\nthe trial court instructed the jury on a heightened duty.\r\n\r\nWe find the Solankis presented sufficient evidence of Wal-Mart's willful, wanton,\r\nor reckless misconduct to send punitive damages to the jury in two factual\r\ncircumstances— the taking of the credit card information for the sale and the\r\nturning over of the credit card information to law enforcement. The trial court\r\nfollowed proper procedure in making this finding. At the close of all evidence,\r\nWal-Mart moved for a directed verdict, asserting the Solankis had not proven gross\r\nnegligence, and the trial court denied the motion. In its order denying Wal-Mart's\r\npost-trial motions, the trial court explicitly found sufficient evidence of willful,\r\nwanton, or reckless misconduct by Wal-Mart to send the issue to the jury.\r\nParticularly in light of the standard of review for directed verdict motions, we find\r\nsufficient evidence existed at the close of evidence to allow the issue of gross\r\nnegligence to go to the jury. Wal-Mart attempted to run Mr. Solanki's credit card\r\nat least three times. When that was unsuccessful, the employee resorted to\r\nmanually stenciling Mr. Solanki's credit card; however, the information hand-\r\nkeyed into the cash register belonged to Martin. At the end of the transaction, the\r\nreceipt presented had Mr. Solanki's signature but showed Martin's credit card\r\ninformation. These facts combined with Mr. Solanki's testimony that he did not\r\nuse Martin's credit card could allow a reasonable jury to determine Wal-Mart's\r\nactions amounted to gross negligence. When reviewing these facts in the light\r\nmost favorable to the Solankis, we find no error in the trial court's conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe trial court also found evidence was presented from which a reasonable jury\r\ncould have concluded Wal-Mart was aware of the dangerous condition it created.\r\nIt determined Wal-Mart knew the employee hand-keyed the transaction and\r\ntestimony was presented Mr. Solanki did not present any card but his own to the\r\ncashier. Therefore, viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the Solankis, the\r\ntrial court determined it would be reasonable to conclude Wal-Mart was\r\nresponsible for the error in processing the credit card. Furthermore, the trial court\r\nconcluded Wal-Mart was responsible for the creation and production of the\r\nevidence used to arrest Mr. Solanki and it was in the best possible position to point\r\nout the discrepancies to the police officers.\r\n\r\nII.   Post-trial Motions\r\n\nWal-Mart asserts the evidence was insufficient to sustain the grant of punitive\r\ndamages. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying the motion to reverse or\r\nreduce the amount of punitive damages.\r\n\r\nRegarding the motion for JNOV, Wal-Mart argues the denial of this motion was\r\nthe first time the trial court made a finding of willful, wanton, or reckless\r\nmisconduct by Wal-Mart. It maintains this was an error of law. Additionally, it\r\nasserts the trial court erred in its evaluation of the Gamble factors and the trial\r\ncourt's reasoning is insufficient to sustain an award of punitive damages under a\r\nclear and convincing standard. In response to the trial court's evaluation of the first\r\nGamble factor (defendant's degree of culpability), Wal-Mart contends the hand\r\nkeying of Mr. Solanki's credit card only speaks to simple negligence. Additionally,\r\nWal-Mart argues that even if its response to the Sheriff's Office's request for\r\ninformation amounted to negligence, it was only simple negligence, and no\r\nevidence was presented Wal-Mart was aware of a dangerous condition it then\r\nfailed to mitigate. Therefore, it contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain\r\nthe award of punitive damages.2 We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing a motion for JNOV, an appellate court must employ the same\r\nstandard as the trial court. Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629\r\nS.E.2d 642, 648 (2006). On appeal from an order denying a motion for JNOV, an\r\nappellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in a light most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party. RFT Mgmt. Co. v. Tinsley & Adams L.L.P.,\r\n399 S.C. 322, 331-32, 732 S.E.2d 166, 171 (2012).\r\n\r\nIn Gamble, 305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354, the supreme court of South\r\nCarolina specified an eight-factor post-verdict review for trial courts to conduct to\r\ndetermine if a punitive damages award comports with due process. The factors\r\nare:         (1) defendant's degree of culpability; (2) duration of the\r\n             conduct; (3) defendant’s awareness or concealment; (4)\r\n             the existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the\r\n             award will deter the defendant or others from like\r\n             conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to\r\n             the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7)\r\n\r\n\r\n Wal-Mart makes no argument regarding the Mitchell, Jr. v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. 570, 686 S.E.2d 176 (2009), factors.\r\n\n             defendant's ability to pay; and finally, (8) . . . other\r\n             factors deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nId. The trial court is not required to make findings of fact for each factor to uphold\r\na punitive damage award. McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 346, 468\r\nS.E.2d 633, 637 (1996).\r\n\r\n\"[W]e need dwell no longer upon the rationale, or upon the merits or demerits, of\r\nthe doctrine [of punitive damages]. Acquiescence in it for almost two centuries\r\njustifies the conclusion that it is now agreeable to, and part of, the public policy of\r\nthe state.\" Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 574-75, 106 S.E.2d 258,\r\n261-62 (1958).\r\n\r\nAs previously noted, the Solankis presented sufficient evidence to send the issue of\r\npunitive damages to the jury. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying\r\nWal-Mart's post-trial motion to reverse or reduce the amount of the punitive\r\ndamages. We also disagree with Wal-Mart's proposition it was an error of law for\r\nthe trial court to explicitly state its finding of willful, wanton, or reckless\r\nmisconduct for the first time in its order denying Wal-Mart's post-trial motions.\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court's analysis of the Gamble factors is sufficient to sustain the\r\npunitive damages award. The trial court made the required Gamble analysis after\r\nthe award of punitive damages. Regarding the defendant's degree of culpability, it\r\nfound Wal-Mart created and disseminated the evidence used to arrest Mr. Solanki.\r\nTherefore, Wal-Mart was in the best position to point out the hand-keying of the\r\ncredit card information to the Sheriff's Office. As to the duration of the conduct,\r\nthe trial court determined the transaction itself lasted a few minutes. However,\r\nWal-Mart had the opportunity to explain the odd nature of the transaction\r\nthroughout the criminal process. Concerning the defendant's awareness or\r\nconcealment, the trial court found Wal-Mart created the documents and had\r\nexclusive knowledge and possession of them when it turned the information over\r\nto the Sheriff's Office. Furthermore, Wal-Mart was in the best position to ensure\r\nthe transaction was handled properly. The trial court stated a punitive damages\r\naward may encourage greater oversight in Wal-Mart's and similarly situated\r\nvendor's credit card processing procedures. Regarding whether the award is\r\nreasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct, the trial court\r\nfound the award was reasonably related to the harm suffered by Mr. Solanki and\r\nothers who may be improperly accused of a crime due its negligence. It further\r\nfound Wal-Mart was able to pay the punitive damages award. The court\r\nconsidered the fact that the jury was able to view the transaction on video and then\r\n\nrender its verdict as a significant \"other factor.\" We find the evidence supports the\r\ntrial court's ruling.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial court's decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J: I respectfully dissent and believe the trial court improperly sent\r\nthe issue of punitive damages to the jury.\r\n\r\nThe Solankis failed to submit any evidence at trial that Wal-Mart's actions in\r\nprocessing Mr. Solanki's credit card or in complying with law enforcement's\r\nrequest were \"willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of [Mr. Solanki's] rights.\"\r\nSee Longshore v.

Servs., Inc., 365 S.C. 554, 564, 619 S.E.2d 5, 11 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005) (finding \"the plaintiff must prove the defendant's misconduct was\r\nwillful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of his rights\" to support an award of\r\npunitive damages). Although I believe the error in hand-keying Mr. Solanki's\r\ncredit card information would give rise to a negligence claim against Wal-Mart, no\r\nevidence was introduced at trial to show Wal-Mart's conduct was so gross or\r\nreckless of consequences that punitive damages were warranted. See Rogers v.\r\nFlorence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 577, 106 S.E.2d 258, 263 (1958) (\"The test\r\nby which a tort is to be characterized as reckless, wil[l]ful or wanton is whether it\r\nhas been committed in such a manner or under such circumstances that a person of\r\nordinary reason or prudence would then have been conscious of it as an invasion of\r\nthe plaintiff's rights.\"); Hicks v. McCandlish, 221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629,\r\n631 (1952) (\"Gross negligence is a relative term, and means the absence of care\r\nthat is necessary under the circumstances, but the absence of this care alone,\r\nwhether called 'gross' or 'ordinary' negligence, does not authorize the jury to give\r\nexemplary damages.\"); Bell v. Atl. Coast Line R. Co., 202 S.C. 160, 171, 24 S.E.2d\r\n177, 182 (1943) (\"While punitive damages are recoverable for negligence so gross\r\nor reckless of consequences as to imply or to assume the nature of wantonness,\r\nwillfulness or recklessness, yet they are not awarded in this state for mere gross\r\nnegligence.\").\r\n\r\nSpecifically, testimony from trial negates the Solankis' claim that Wal-Mart acted\r\nin a reckless manner. Ryan Smalls, the Wal-Mart employee who handled Mr.\r\n\nSolanki's transaction, testified at trial to Wal-Mart's internal procedures for\r\nhandling credit card transactions. Smalls testified that Wal-Mart's policy, when a\r\ncredit card would not swipe at a self-checkout station, was to first try to finalize the\r\ntransaction at the self check-out station. If this did not work, an employee would\r\nsuspend the transaction and attempt to process the transaction at the employee's\r\nwork station. If the credit card still would not work, the employee would hand key\r\nthe credit card number into the system twice to ensure accuracy, enter the\r\nexpiration date, and then ask a customer service manager to manually perform an\r\noverride. After the override was performed, the employee would then enter the\r\nthree-digit security code on the back of the credit card before finalizing the\r\ntransaction. According to Smalls, even a manager could not override the\r\ntransaction if each of these steps were not properly taken. Although Smalls did not\r\nindependently recollect this transaction with Mr. Solanki, after viewing the video\r\nsurveillance, he affirmed that each of the foregoing steps was taken during this\r\ntransaction. Further, although it is regrettable that Mr. Solanki spent six nights in\r\njail as a result of this incident, the Solankis presented no evidence that Wal-Mart's\r\nactions of complying with law enforcement's request were unreasonable or that\r\nWal-Mart intentionally and recklessly processed Mr. Solanki's credit card\r\ntransaction. See Mishoe v. QHG of Lake City, Inc., 366 S.C. 195, 201, 621 S.E.2d\r\n363, 366 (\"In order to receive an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff has the\r\nburden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the defendant's misconduct\r\nwas willful, wanton, or with reckless disregard for the plaintiff's rights. A\r\nconscious failure to exercise due care constitutes willfulness.\" (internal citations\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\nMoreover, I believe the trial court erred when it failed to adequately assess the\r\nculpability of Wal-Mart's conduct before charging the jury on punitive damages.\r\nSee S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love Chevrolet, Inc., 324 S.C. 149, 154,\r\n478 S.E.2d 57, 59 (1996) (\"First, the [trial] court must determine whether the\r\ndefendant's conduct rises to the level of culpability warranting a punitive damages\r\naward. If not, the issue of punitive damages may not be submitted to the jury.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); Longshore, 365 S.C. at 564, 619 S.E.2d at 11 (\"[T]rial judges\r\nin this state have long been required, as a threshold matter, to assess the\r\nculpability of a defendant's conduct to determine whether punitive damages are\r\navailable in a given case (i.e., whether the issue should be submitted to the jury).\"\r\n(emphasis added) (quoting South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Love\r\nChevrolet, Inc., 324 S.C. 149, 152, 478 S.E.2d 57, 58 (1996))). Rather, the extent\r\nof the trial court's observation on the issues of gross negligence and punitive\r\ndamages was as follows:\r\n\n            As a general rule, the issues of gross negligence are\r\n            properly for the jury to determine. There's evidence,\r\n            based upon the weirdness of the transaction, for lack of a\r\n            better word, . . . from which the jury could conclude that,\r\n            in some way, . . . the defendant Wal-Mart, was grossly\r\n            negligent in the way they handled the transaction. . . . I'll\r\n            charge gross negligence and punitives.\r\n\r\nI believe the \"weirdness of the transaction,\" standing alone, is insufficient as a\r\nmatter of law to substantiate a gross negligence claim or to support an award of\r\npunitive damages. Thus, I respectfully disagree with the majority and would hold\r\nthe trial court erred in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5265","title":"State v.

We reverse and remand.\r\n\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nMcCombs was indicted for committing a lewd act on a minor. The case was called\r\nfor trial on March 5, 2012. During a pretrial hearing to address the State's motion\r\nin limine to admit evidence of a prior bad act, the State presented testimony from a\r\nprior victim (\"Jessica\"), the detective who investigated the prior bad act, and the\r\nvictim whom McCombs was on trial for molesting (\"Victim\").\r\n\r\nJessica was the first witness called to testify at the pre-trial hearing. She testified\r\nthat in 2001, when she was eleven years old, she went with her friend Joshua,\r\nMcCombs' grandson, to McCombs' house for a pool party. Jessica stated she had\r\nnot met McCombs prior to the party. According to Jessica, she did not initially get\r\ninto the water, but McCombs told her if she did not get in the pool, she could not\r\nbe at his house. Jessica testified that in hindsight she was sure he was joking, but\r\nshe interpreted it differently on the day of the incident. According to Jessica, once\r\nshe was in the pool, McCombs guided her around in the water by her waist and\r\nstuck his finger under her two-piece bathing suit and felt her vagina. Jessica stated\r\nMcCombs talked to her while he was touching her but not about the touching.\r\nJessica recalled that McCombs had been drinking at the time of the incident.\r\nJessica left the pool, and McCombs followed her into the kitchen and sat her on his\r\nlap. Jessica subsequently went into the computer room, and McCombs followed\r\nher. Jessica testified McCombs stuck his hands down her pants from behind and\r\ntouched her vagina in the computer room. On cross-examination, Jessica testified\r\nMcCombs also stuck his fingers in her mouth. Jessica reported the incident, and\r\nMcCombs was charged with committing a lewd act on a minor and assault with\r\nintent to commit criminal sexual conduct (ACSC). McCombs pled guilty to assault\r\nand battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) in July 2002.\r\n\r\nDetective Miller, the investigator assigned to Jessica's case, was also called to\r\ntestify at the pretrial hearing. Detective Miller stated that after the incident, Jessica\r\nreported McCombs groped her in the pool, sucked on her fingers in the kitchen,\r\nand attempted to fondle her vagina in the computer room. According to Detective\r\nMiller, Jessica did not report that McCombs stuck his hands under her bathing suit\r\nin the pool. He testified that if she had reported that McCombs stuck his hand\r\nunder her bathing suit in the pool, he would have charged McCombs with an\r\nadditional count of ACSC.\r\n\r\nVictim also testified at the pretrial hearing. She testified that on August 1, 2009,\r\nwhen she was nine years old, she was at McCombs' house for her grandmother's\r\nbirthday party. Victim stated that she lived in the same neighborhood and knew\r\n\nMcCombs. Victim testified she was in the pool with McCombs when he put his\r\nhand under her two-piece bathing suit and touched her vagina. According to\r\nVictim, McCombs was talking to her about school during the incident. Victim\r\nstated she tried to reach a concrete area on the side of the pool as McCombs was\r\npushing harder on her vagina. She testified she did not know if the touching was\r\npurposeful, but she thought it was. Victim did not remember if McCombs was\r\ndrinking at the time of the incident.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the State moved to admit the prior bad act involving Jessica based\r\non the common scheme or plan exception to the exclusion of prior bad act\r\nevidence under Rule 404(b), SCRE. The circuit court found the evidence of the\r\nprior bad act was inadmissible, ruling:\r\n\r\n               [Because] I have found that the evidence, if admissible,\r\n               would be relevant, . . . I must make a determination of\r\n               whether it would be under 404(b), whether it would be\r\n               admissible as a common scheme or plan, in which the\r\n               State has indicated that is what it intends to proceed\r\n               under. The court must look at whether the admission of\r\n               the evidence of the 2001 incident is logically relevant to\r\n               the crime that we are here for today. The charges are\r\n               substantially the same. As the State pointed out several\r\n               times[,] the victims were both female. . . . [T]he alleged\r\n               incidents occurred at the defendant's home in the pool.\r\n               The similarities at that point become unclear and it\r\n               becomes confusing based upon the testimony that was\r\n               given by [Jessica] and then the detective that has testified\r\n               today. I agree with the State that the analysis and\r\n               purpose of the forensic interview is to fully articulate and\r\n               develop the story and the allegations, and so I can\r\n               understand why there may be some discrepancy between\r\n               what the victim testified to, or indicated to the detective\r\n               and what was disclosed. I am concerned that there, as the\r\n               analysis unfolds one of the factors from [Wallace1] is the\r\n               use of coercion or threats. [The victim] said there was no\r\n               threats given in the pool. [Jessica] said that he forced her\r\n               and threatened her to get into the pool. The relationship\r\n               between the victim and the perpetrator is the same. The\r\n\r\n1   State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 683 S.E.2d 275 (2009).\r\n\n             perpetrator, the victims in both cases were friends. They\r\n             were invited to swim over there at his pool. [Jessica] did\r\n             testify that the defendant was drinking. The victim . . .\r\n             testified that she was not sure, and did not know if he had\r\n             been drinking. I must weigh the similarities against the\r\n             dissimilarities and if the similarities outweigh the\r\n             dissimilarities the Bad Act evidence is admissible, if the\r\n             similarities outweigh the dissimilarities. Then I must do\r\n             a 403 balancing test if I find that the proof is clear and\r\n             convincing. Based upon my, as I stated previously, I do\r\n             feel that the dissimilarities outweigh the similarities as\r\n             testified to. I do find that even assuming that the\r\n             similarities would outweigh the dissimilarities the\r\n             remoteness in time under the 403 balancing test makes it\r\n             more prejudicial than probative. I am denying the\r\n             request for the 404(b) analysis . . . .\r\n\r\nThe State appeals pursuant to State v. Henry, 313 S.C. 106, 432 S.E.2d 489 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1993).2\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review only errors of law, and it is\r\nbound by the circuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\r\nState v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). \"The admission or\r\nexclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the [circuit court], whose\r\ndecision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\" State v.\r\nBlack, 400 S.C. 10, 16, 732 S.E.2d 880, 884 (2012). \"An abuse of discretion\r\noccurs when the [circuit] court's ruling is based on an error of law or, when\r\ngrounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.\" State v. Jennings,\r\n394 S.C. 473, 477-78, 716 S.E.2d 91, 93 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Pursuant to State v. Henry, a pretrial order suppressing evidence that significantly\r\nimpairs the prosecution of a criminal case is directly appealable. 313 S.C. at 107-\r\n08, 432 S.E.2d at 490.\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe State argues the circuit court erred in finding McCombs' prior bad act was\r\ninadmissible because the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities. We agree.\r\n\r\nTo admit evidence of prior bad acts, the circuit court must first determine whether\r\nthe proffered evidence is relevant. State v. Clasby, 385 S.C. 148, 154, 682 S.E.2d\r\n892, 895 (2009). If the circuit court finds the evidence is relevant, the court must\r\nthen determine whether the bad act evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Rules of Evidence. Id. Rule 404(b) precludes evidence of a\r\ndefendant's prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendant's guilt for the\r\ncrime charged, except to establish (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake\r\nor accident; (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or\r\nmore crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the other;\r\nor (5) the identity of the perpetrator. See Rule 404(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\n             To be admissible, the bad act must logically relate to the\r\n             crime with which the defendant has been charged. If the\r\n             defendant was not convicted of the prior crime, evidence\r\n             of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing. . . .\r\n             When considering whether there is clear and convincing\r\n             evidence of other bad acts, an appellate court is bound by\r\n             the [circuit] court's factual findings unless they are\r\n             clearly erroneous.\r\n\r\nClasby, 385 S.C. at 155, 682 S.E.2d at 895 (citations and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted). \"If the [circuit court] concludes there is clear and convincing evidence\r\nthat the defendant committed the uncharged acts, he or she must determine\r\nwhether the prior acts fall within the common scheme or plan exception.\" Id. at\r\n155, 682 S.E.2d at 896.\r\n\r\n\"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is admissible to show a common\r\nscheme or plan when a 'close degree of similarity [exists] between the crime\r\ncharged and the prior bad act.'\" State v. Taylor, 399 S.C. 51, 59, 731 S.E.2d 596,\r\n601 (Ct. App. 2012) (quoting State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 30, 667 S.E.2d 728, 731\r\n(2008)). \"When determining whether evidence is admissible as [a] common\r\nscheme or plan [under Rule 404(b)], the [circuit] court must analyze the\r\nsimilarities and dissimilarities between the crime charged and the bad act evidence\r\nto determine whether there is a close degree of similarity.\" Wallace, 384 S.C. at\r\n433, 683 S.E.2d at 277-78. \"A close degree of similarity exists when the\r\n\n'similarities outweigh the dissimilarities.'\" State v. Scott, 405 S.C. 489, 500, 748\r\nS.E.2d 236, 242 (Ct. App. 2013) (quoting Wallace, 384 S.C. at 433, 683 S.E.2d at\r\n278). When determining whether a close degree of similarity exists, the circuit\r\ncourt \"should consider all relevant factors.\" Taylor, 399 S.C. at 59, 731 S.E.2d at\r\n601.\r\n\r\nIn Wallace, our supreme court listed several factors for the circuit court to consider\r\nwhen determining whether there is a close degree of similarity between the prior\r\nbad act and the charged crime in cases involving the sexual abuse of a minor:\r\n\r\n             (1) the age of the victims when the abuse occurred; (2)\r\n             the relationship between the victims and the perpetrator;\r\n             (3) the location where the abuse occurred; (4) the use of\r\n             coercion or threats; and (5) the manner of the occurrence,\r\n             for example, the type of sexual battery.\r\n\r\n384 S.C. at 433-34, 683 S.E.2d at 278.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Hubner, 362 S.C. 572, 585, 608 S.E.2d 463, 469 (Ct. App. 2005), rev'd,\r\n384 S.C. 436, 683 S.E.2d 279 (2009), the court of appeals reversed the circuit\r\ncourt's decision to admit prior bad act evidence after determining the similarities\r\nwere insufficient to support the admission of the evidence. In Hubner, the court of\r\nappeals considered the following similarities: (1) the perpetrator inappropriately\r\ntouched both girls and (2) the girls were the same age when they were abused. Id.\r\nThe court of appeals also considered the following dissimilarities: (1) the location\r\nof the abuse; (2) the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator; (3) the use\r\nof coercion or threats; and (4) the type of sexual battery. Id. at 585-86, 608 S.E.2d\r\nat 469-70. Additionally, the acts in Hubner occurred fourteen years apart from\r\neach other. Id. at 584, 608 S.E.2d at 469. In reversing the circuit court, the court\r\nof appeals held the events occurred \"under different circumstances, at different\r\ntimes, in different places, and in different ways.\" Id. at 586, 608 S.E.2d at 470\r\n(quoting State v. Berry, 332 S.C. 214, 219, 503 S.E.2d 770, 773 (Ct. App. 1998)).\r\nHowever, our supreme court reversed the court of appeals. See State v. Hubner,\r\n384 S.C. 436, 683 S.E.2d 279 (2009). Citing to Wallace, our supreme court found\r\nthe court of appeals erred in reversing the circuit court's admission of the prior bad\r\nact evidence. Id. at 437, 683 S.E.2d 280.\r\n\r\nBased on Jessica's testimony, we find the following similarities exist between the\r\nprior bad act and the charged crime: (1) the female victims were approximately the\r\nsame age; (2) the abuse occurred in the pool at the same residence; (3) the abuse\r\n\noccurred during a party; (4) both victims were neighborhood children; (5) both\r\nvictims were touched underneath their bathing suits; (6) the touching occurred\r\nunderwater; and (7) McCombs continued to talk to the victims while the abuse\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nDetective Miller testified that Jessica reported McCombs groped her in the pool,\r\nsucked on her fingers in the kitchen, and attempted to fondle her vagina in the\r\ncomputer room. Although Detective Miller's testimony differs from Jessica's\r\ntestimony, we find his testimony still presents the following significant similarities:\r\n(1) both victims were young females; (2) both victims were neighborhood children;\r\n(3) both victims were abused at the same residence; (4) both victims were groped\r\nin the swimming pool; (5) both victims were attending a pool party at McCombs'\r\nhouse; and (6) both victims were inappropriately touched in the vaginal area.\r\nBased on Jessica's and Detective Miller's testimonies, we find the events occurred\r\nunder similar circumstances, in similar places, and in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the circuit court considered two dissimilarities: (1) McCombs' use of\r\nthreats or coercion and (2) McCombs' consumption of alcohol prior to\r\ninappropriately touching the girls. Jessica testified that she initially felt coerced\r\ninto getting into the pool, but she later testified that she was \"sure he was joking.\"\r\nVictim did not report the use of any threats or coercion. Regarding McCombs'\r\nconsumption of alcohol, Jessica testified McCombs was drinking during the\r\ncommission of the prior bad act, but Victim could not remember if McCombs had\r\nbeen drinking prior to inappropriately touching her. We find these dissimilarities\r\nto be insubstantial. Upon review of the factors and in light of our supreme court's\r\nholdings in Wallace and Hubner, we find the circuit court erred in finding the\r\ndissimilarities outweighed the similarities. We find a close degree of similarity\r\nexists between the prior bad act and the charged crime, and the evidence of the\r\nprior bad act should have been admitted under Rule 404(b).\r\n\r\nAfter ruling the evidence should not have been admitted under Rule 404(b), the\r\ncircuit court found the admission of the prior bad act evidence was more\r\nprejudicial than probative under Rule 403 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence\r\ndue to the dissimilarities and the \"remoteness in time\" between the acts. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\"Once bad act evidence is found admissible under Rule 404(b), the [circuit] court\r\nmust then conduct the prejudice analysis required by Rule 403, SCRE.\" Wallace,\r\n384 S.C. at 435, 683 S.E.2d at 278. Under Rule 403, \"relevant[] evidence may be\r\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\n\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of\r\nundue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"\r\n\"The probative value of evidence falling within one of the Rule 404(b) exceptions\r\nmust substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\"\r\nWallace, 384 S.C. at 435, 683 S.E.2d at 278-79. \"'Unfair prejudice means an\r\nundue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.'\" Scott, 405 S.C. at\r\n505-06, 748 S.E.2d at 245 (quoting State v.

In fact, evidence\r\nof prior bad acts that occurred many years before the charged crime is often\r\nadmissible to prove a common scheme or plan. Scott, 405 S.C. at 504, 748 S.E.2d\r\nat 244; see Blanton, 316 S.C. at 33, 446 S.E.2d at 440 (holding the circuit court\r\nproperly admitted testimony regarding a bad act that occurred seven to eight years\r\nbefore the charged crime).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the probative value of Jessica's testimony outweighs the danger\r\nof unfair prejudice. As previously discussed, the similarities between the charged\r\ncrime and the prior bad act outweigh the dissimilarities. Additionally, the temporal\r\nremoteness between the two acts does not bar the admission of the evidence of the\r\nprior bad. Although the incidents occurred eight years apart, we believe the\r\nprobative value of the prior bad act outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice.\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court erred in denying the admission of McCombs'\r\nprior bad act.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the circuit court erred in denying the admission of\r\nevidence of McCombs' prior bad act.

Appellant/Respondent,\r\nAnthony K. Blakney, seeks review of the sentence imposed by the circuit court for\r\n\nhis April 2011 CSP violations. The circuit court (hereinafter, \"the first CSP\r\njudge\") revoked Blakney's community supervision, gave him credit for prison time\r\nserved,1 and required him to begin a new two-year CSP. Blakney argues he was no\r\nlonger subject to community supervision because he had satisfied the terms of the\r\noriginal sentence for his first degree burglary conviction, which was fifteen years,\r\nsuspended on the service of thirty months. Blakney contends once he served an\r\naggregate amount of thirty months in prison for his burglary conviction and\r\nsubsequent CSP violations, he could no longer be imprisoned for successive CSP\r\nrevocations or be required to participate in a CSP.\r\n\r\nThe Department appeals an order issued by the circuit court (\"the second CSP\r\njudge\") after a revocation hearing relating to CSP violations allegedly committed\r\nby Blakney in April 2012. The second CSP judge did not consider the alleged\r\nviolations. Rather, he concluded Blakney had satisfied the terms of his burglary\r\nsentence when he completed thirty months of imprisonment and, thus, Blakney\r\nwas no longer subject to community supervision. We affirm the first CSP judge's\r\nruling, reverse the second CSP judge's order, and remand for a new hearing on the\r\nviolations allegedly committed by Blakney in April 2012.\r\n\r\n                      FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Blakney was convicted of first degree burglary, a \"no parole offense.\"2\r\nOn November 6, 2008, the sentencing judge imposed on Blakney the following\r\nsentence:\r\n\r\n1Blakney was arrested for his April 2011 CSP violations in May 2011, and the first\r\nCSP judge sentenced him in January 2012.\r\n2 S.C. Code Ann. § 24-13-100 (2007) (\"For purposes of definition under South\r\nCarolina law, a 'no parole offense' means a class A, B, or C felony or an offense\r\nexempt from classification as enumerated in Section 16-1-10(d), which is\r\npunishable by a maximum term of imprisonment for twenty years or more.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-1-10(D) (Supp. 2013) (listing first degree\r\nburglary as exempt from classification under subsections (A) and (B) of section\r\n16-1-10); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-11-311(B) (2003) (setting forth the maximum\r\nsentence for first degree burglary as life imprisonment). Section 24-21-560(A) of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (2007) requires an individual convicted of a \"no parole\r\noffense\" to complete a CSP operated by the Department after his release from\r\nprison.\r\n\n             [T]he Defendant is committed to the . . . State\r\n             Department of Corrections . . . for a determinate term\r\n             of 15 . . . years . . . and/or to pay a fine of $_______;\r\n             provided that upon the service of 30 . . . months . . .\r\n             and/or payment of $_______; plus costs and assessments\r\n             as applicable[]; the balance is suspended with probation\r\n             for ____ months/years and subject to South Carolina\r\n             Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services\r\n             standard conditions of probation, which are incorporated\r\n             by reference.\r\n\r\n(emphases in original).3 The Sentence Sheet indicates the sentencing judge gave\r\nBlakney credit for time served—Blakney had been in prison since March 23, 2008.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 2010, Blakney was released from prison and placed on two years of\r\ncommunity supervision.4 On November 3, 2010, Blakney was arrested for\r\nviolating the terms of his CSP. After a revocation hearing on February 25, 2011,\r\nthe first CSP judge revoked Blakney's community supervision but gave him credit\r\n\r\n\r\n3At oral argument in this appeal, counsel for the Department offered a possible\r\nexplanation for the sentencing judge's failure to impose a term of probation: In\r\nState v. Dawkins, 352 S.C. 162, 166-67, 573 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2002), our supreme\r\ncourt held that a term of probation runs concurrently with a mandatory CSP term\r\nfor a sentence deriving from a \"no parole offense.\" Section 24-21-560(E) of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code provides that a defendant who successfully completes a CSP\r\nhas satisfied his sentence and must be discharged from his sentence. Therefore, a\r\ndefendant's completion of his CSP term discharges any residual probation,\r\nDawkins, 352 S.C. at 167, 573 S.E.2d at 785, and, thus, circuit judges may have\r\nfound it futile to add a term of probation to sentences for no parole offenses.\r\n4 A CSP may last up to two continuous years. S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-560(B).\r\nFurther, section 24-13-150(A) (2007) requires the individual to serve \"at least\r\neighty-five percent of the actual term of imprisonment imposed\" in order to be\r\neligible for a CSP. The statute also states: \"This percentage . . . is to be applied to\r\nthe actual term of imprisonment imposed, not including any portion of the sentence\r\n[that] has been suspended.\" Here, the Department of Corrections apparently\r\ndetermined that Blakney had served eighty-five percent of the unsuspended portion\r\nof his sentence, i.e., eighty-five percent of thirty months.\r\n\nfor time served, which was three months and fifteen days, and released him. At\r\nthis point, Blakney began a new two-year CSP.5\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 2011, Blakney was arrested for additional CSP violations. On\r\nDecember 9, 2011, the first CSP judge conducted another revocation hearing. At\r\nthis hearing, counsel for Blakney argued that Blakney should not be sanctioned for\r\nCSP violations because he had already completed the unsuspended portion of his\r\nsentence, i.e., thirty months of imprisonment. In response, the Department argued\r\nthat, under State v. Picklesimer,6 the limit for the aggregate amount of service upon\r\nsuccessive CSP revocations is the term of the original sentence, i.e., in Blakney's\r\ncase, the full fifteen years. Counsel for Blakney asserted that this case is\r\ndistinguishable from Picklesimer because the sentencing judge had not imposed a\r\nterm of probation as part of Blakney's sentence.\r\n\r\nThe first CSP judge took the issue under advisement. After a hearing on January\r\n19, 2012, the first CSP judge revoked Blakney's community supervision, gave him\r\ncredit for time served, and released him to begin a new two-year CSP. Blakney's\r\nappeal followed.\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 2012, Blakney was arrested once again for CSP violations. After\r\nconducting a revocation hearing on August 17, 2012, the second CSP judge issued\r\nan order finding Blakney had satisfied the terms of the original sentence for his\r\nburglary conviction and was no longer subject to community supervision.7 The\r\nDepartment's appeal followed. Although the second CSP judge's order effectively\r\nnullified the first CSP judge's ruling requiring Blakney to begin a new CSP,\r\nBlakney did not withdraw his appeal of the first CSP judge's ruling. After the\r\nDepartment appealed the second CSP judge's order, its appeal was consolidated\r\nwith Blakney's appeal.\r\n\r\n5 Once an individual's community supervision is revoked, he must begin the\r\nrequired CSP term anew. See S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-560(D) (Supp. 2013) (\"If a\r\nprisoner's community supervision is revoked . . . and the court imposes a period of\r\nincarceration for the revocation, the prisoner also must complete a community\r\nsupervision program of up to two years as determined by the department pursuant\r\nto subsection (B) when he is released from incarceration.\").\r\n6   388 S.C. 264, 268-69, 695 S.E.2d 845, 848 (2010).\r\n7 During the revocation hearing, the second CSP judge indicated there was no need\r\nto place Blakney's CSP violations on the record because \"he shouldn't be here.\"\r\n\n                               ISSUE ON APPEAL \n\r\n\r\nHas Blakney satisfied the terms of his original sentence such that he is no longer\r\nsubject to community supervision?\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Thus, an appellate court is\r\nbound by the circuit court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Id.\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSection 24-21-560(D) of the South Carolina Code states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n             If a prisoner's community supervision is revoked by the\r\n             court and the court imposes a period of incarceration for\r\n             the revocation, the prisoner also must complete a\r\n             community supervision program of up to two years as\r\n             determined by the department pursuant to subsection (B)\r\n             when he is released from incarceration.\r\n\r\n             A prisoner who is sentenced for successive revocations\r\n             of the community supervision program may be required\r\n             to serve terms of incarceration for successive\r\n             revocations, as provided in Section 24-21-560(C), and\r\n             may be required to serve additional periods of\r\n             community supervision for successive revocations, as\r\n             provided in Section 24-21-560(D).         The maximum\r\n             aggregate amount of time a prisoner may be required to\r\n             serve when sentenced for successive [CSP] revocations\r\n             may not exceed an amount of time equal to the length of\r\n             incarceration imposed limited by the amount of time\r\n             remaining on the original \"no parole offense[.]\"[] The\r\n             prisoner must not be incarcerated for a period longer\r\n             than the original sentence. The original term of\r\n             incarceration does not include any portion of a suspended\r\n             sentence.\r\n\n(emphases added).\r\n\r\nIn State v. McGrier, 378 S.C. 320, 331, 663 S.E.2d 15, 21 (2008), our supreme\r\ncourt held that revocations for successive CSP violations \"should not extend or\r\nexceed the term of incarceration that was originally ordered for the underlying\r\noffense.\" The court explained that section 24-21-560(D) limits \"the total amount\r\nof time an inmate could be incarcerated after a CSP revocation to . . . the length of\r\nthe remaining balance of the sentence for the 'no parole offense.'\" Id. at 332, 663\r\nS.E.2d at 21.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in Picklesimer, our supreme court applied section 24-21-560(D) to a\r\nten-year sentence that had been suspended on the service of five years'\r\nimprisonment and five years' probation. 388 S.C. at 265, 695 S.E.2d at 846. The\r\ncourt held the \"original sentence,\" as referenced in section 24-21-560(D), included\r\n\"both the suspended and unsuspended portions of a circuit court's sentence.\" Id. at\r\n268, 695 S.E.2d at 848. The court explained \"it is, in fact, the total sentence\r\nhanded down by the court.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the thirty months served by Blakney was the unsuspended portion only. The\r\ntotal sentence for Blakney's burglary conviction was fifteen years. Therefore, the\r\naggregate amount of time Blakney is required to serve in prison or participate in a\r\nCSP may not exceed fifteen years. See id. at 270, 695 S.E.2d at 848-49 (\"[U]nder\r\nno circumstances shall a defendant be incarcerated, or forced to participate in\r\nmandatory CSP or residual probation, stemming from the same conviction, outside\r\nof the time given by the trial judge in the original sentence[.]\"). In other words, to\r\nsatisfy his burglary sentence, Blakney must either successfully complete a CSP or\r\ncontinue in a CSP due to violation revocations until the end of the fifteen-year\r\nsentence.8 See S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-560(E) (\"A prisoner who successfully\r\n\r\n In determining the date that the defendant's original sentence expired, the\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nPicklesimer court gave credit to the defendant for not only the time he served in\r\nprison but also the time he participated in a CSP. See Picklesimer, 388 S.C. at 268\r\nn.3, 695 S.E.2d at 848 n.3 (\"[O]ur holding sets only an outside time limit on a\r\ndefendant's aggregate amount of incarceration and/or CSP participation.\"); id. at\r\n265 n.1, 695 S.E.2d at 846 n.1 (noting the defendant's original ten-year sentence\r\nhad begun on June 1, 2000); id. at 269 n.4, 695 S.E.2d at 848 n.4 (recognizing that\r\nthe term of the defendant's original sentence had expired on June 1, 2010); id. at\r\n270, 695 S.E.2d at 849 (explaining that the defendant would be eligible for\r\nincarceration due to CSP revocations \"until the outside time limit of his original\r\nsentence, June 1, 2010, or until he successfully completed his CSP\").\r\n\ncompletes a community supervision program pursuant to this section has satisfied\r\nhis sentence and must be discharged from his sentence.\"); Picklesimer, 388 S.C. at\r\n270, 695 S.E.2d at 848 (\"'[S]uccessful completion' of CSP connotes the completion\r\nof a maximum of two continuous years of CSP, as mandated by section 24-21-\r\n560(B), without any violations or revocations, or a determination by the\r\nDepartment that a defendant has fulfilled his CSP responsibilities prior to two\r\nyears' service in the program.\"); id. at 271, 695 S.E.2d at 849 (\"[A] defendant will\r\neither successfully complete his CSP, or continue in CSP due to violation\r\nrevocations until the end of the original sentence, at which time the sentence will\r\nhave been fulfilled.\").\r\n\r\nThe second CSP judge found Blakney's circumstances were distinguishable from\r\nthe circumstances in Picklesimer. The second CSP judge reasoned that, unlike the\r\nsentence imposed in Picklesimer, Blakney's sentence for his burglary conviction\r\ndid not include a term of probation. However, the existence of a term of probation\r\nfor the prisoner in Picklesimer did not make its holding any less applicable to CSP\r\nrevocations that do not involve a term of probation. The identification of the\r\n\"original sentence\" employs the same uncomplicated analysis in both situations.\r\nWe read Picklesimer's interpretation of section 24-21-560(D) as applying to all\r\nCSP revocations, whether or not the individual subject to a CSP is also subject to a\r\nterm of regular probation.\r\n\r\nThe dissent expresses concern over the fact that Blakney's original fifteen-year\r\nsentence was erroneously suspended.9 However, this erroneous suspension does\r\n\r\n See S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-410 (2007) (\"After conviction or plea for any\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\noffense, except a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment, the judge of a\r\ncourt of record with criminal jurisdiction at the time of sentence may suspend the\r\nimposition or the execution of a sentence and place the defendant on probation or\r\nmay impose a fine and also place the defendant on probation.\" (emphasis added));\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 16-11-311(B) (\"Burglary in the first degree is a felony\r\npunishable by life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, \"life\" means until\r\ndeath. The court, in its discretion, may sentence the defendant to a term of not less\r\nthan fifteen years.\" (emphases added)); State v. Jacobs, 393 S.C. 584, 589, 713\r\nS.E.2d 621, 624 (2011) (\"We find that section 24-21-410 of the South Carolina\r\n[C]ode does not give courts the authority to suspend sentences for crimes\r\npunishable by death or life imprisonment, and this includes crimes that include\r\nlesser sentences than death or life imprisonment.\").\r\n\nnot affect our application of section 24-21-560(D), as interpreted in McGrier and\r\nPicklesimer, to the present case. See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d\r\n26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"[W]hatever doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.\").\r\nFirst, the suspension of Blakney's sentence is the law of the case, as the State has\r\nnever sought to correct this error. Cf. State v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 132-33, 564\r\nS.E.2d 372, 376 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding, in a probation revocation case, that any\r\nlack of authority on the part of the sentencing judge to impose a particular sentence\r\non the underlying conviction did not affect the circuit court's subject matter\r\njurisdiction to later proceed with the revocation because the defendant did not\r\nchallenge the underlying sentence in a motion to reconsider, on direct appeal, or as\r\na defense to the probation revocation proceedings, and, therefore, the underlying\r\nsentence was the law of the case). Accordingly, this court does not have the\r\nauthority to correct the error, and, notwithstanding the dissent's statement to the\r\ncontrary, it is necessary to reference Picklesimer's definition of \"original sentence\"\r\nin applying section 24-21-560(D) to the present case. See Commander Health\r\nCare Facilities, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 370 S.C. 296, 303,\r\n634 S.E.2d 664, 667 (Ct.

See Picklesimer, 388 S.C. at\r\n268, 695 S.E.2d at 848 (holding that the term \"original sentence,\" as referenced in\r\nsection 24-21-560(D), is the total sentence handed down by the court); id. at 268-\r\n69, 695 S.E.2d at 848 (stating that to interpret \"original sentence\" as only the\r\nunsuspended portion \"would be to virtually eliminate the suspended portion of any\r\nsentence\"); McGrier, 378 S.C. at 322, 663 S.E.2d at 16 (applying section 24-21-\r\n560(D) to a sentence that had not been suspended). Therefore, while the State,\r\ncurrently represented by the Department, is barred from arguing that Blakney's\r\nfifteen-year sentence was improperly suspended (see supra; infra dissent), it is not\r\n\nbarred from taking the position that, in any event, for purposes of section 24-21-\r\n560(D), as interpreted in McGrier and Picklesimer, the original sentence was\r\nfifteen years. In the Department's appellate brief, it took both of these positions.\r\n\r\nAs to the dissent's statement that the State should honor the representations the\r\nSolicitor made to Blakney in plea negotiations, it is not for this court in this case to\r\nspeculate on the actual representations made by the Solicitor to Blakney, who was\r\nrepresented by counsel when he signed the Sentence Sheet. Further, we disagree\r\nwith the dissent's suggestion that Blakney should receive special treatment because\r\nwhen he pled guilty he may not have been aware of the aggregate amount of time\r\nhe could be required to serve in prison or participate in a CSP after successive CSP\r\nrevocations. See McGrier, 378 S.C. at 331, 663 S.E.2d at 21 (stating that\r\ncommunity supervision is a collateral consequence of a conviction for a \"no-parole\r\noffense\" and citing Jackson v. State, 349 S.C. 62, 64, 562 S.E.2d 475, 475 (2002));\r\nJackson, 349 S.C. at 63-64, 562 S.E.2d at 475-76 (rejecting a post-conviction relief\r\napplicant's argument that his guilty plea was involuntary because his trial counsel\r\nfailed to inform him about mandatory participation in a CSP in advising him\r\nwhether to plead guilty); id. at 64, 562 S.E.2d at 476 (holding that counsel was not\r\nineffective for failing to inform his client about mandatory CSP participation in\r\nadvising him whether to plead guilty because participation in a CSP is a collateral\r\nconsequence of sentencing).\r\n\r\nFinally, the dissent suggests that if the court interprets Blakney's original sentence\r\nas being fifteen years, he will have to serve eighty-five percent of fifteen years in\r\nprison. This is not the case. Section 24-13-150(A) requires a \"no parole\" inmate\r\nto serve \"at least eighty-five percent of the actual term of imprisonment imposed\"\r\nin order to be eligible for community supervision. The statute further states: \"This\r\npercentage . . . is to be applied to the actual term of imprisonment imposed, not\r\nincluding any portion of the sentence [that] has been suspended.\" Here, Blakney's\r\nfifteen-year sentence was suspended upon the service of thirty months, which is the\r\nlaw of the case (see supra). Therefore, section 24-13-150(A) does not require\r\nBlakney to go back and serve eighty-five percent of the full fifteen years before he\r\nis eligible to participate in a CSP. In any event, the maximum time Blakney may\r\nbe required to serve in prison or participate in a CSP is the term of his original\r\nsentence, fifteen years. Of course, Blakney can make all of this go away by simply\r\ncomplying with the terms of his CSP for no more than two years. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 24-21-560(E) (\"A prisoner who successfully completes a community\r\nsupervision program pursuant to this section has satisfied his sentence and must be\r\ndischarged from his sentence.\").\r\n\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the first CSP judge's ruling, reverse the second\r\nCSP judge's order, and remand for a new hearing on the violations allegedly\r\ncommitted by Blakney in April 2012.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nFEW, C.J., dissenting: The State and Blakney requested, and the trial court\r\nimposed, a sentence we now know was impermissible under law. See State v.\r\nJacobs, 393 S.C. 584, 588-89, 713 S.E.2d 621, 623-24 (2011) (holding a\r\nsentencing court has no power to suspend the minimum fifteen year sentence for\r\nburglary in the first degree because it carries a maximum sentence of life in\r\nprison). The law does not provide this court a clear resolution for the dispute that\r\nhas arisen as to the execution of that sentence. The majority has thoroughly\r\nexplained its proposed resolution, and I agree with the majority's interpretation of\r\nthe sentencing statutes. However, I would not resolve this appeal by interpreting\r\nthe sentencing statutes. Instead, I would hold the State may not argue to a\r\nsentencing court that the court has the power to suspend a sentence, and after the\r\ncourt accepts the State's argument and suspends the sentence, turn around and\r\nargue, as it has done in this appeal, the sentence may not be suspended. I would\r\nhold the State is estopped from taking the position it takes on appeal because it\r\ntook precisely the opposite position when it asked the sentencing court to suspend\r\nthe minimum of fifteen years. See Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Rhodes, 405 S.C. 584,\r\n597, 748 S.E.2d 781, 788 (2013) (\"Judicial estoppel is an equitable concept that\r\nprevents a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with . . . one the litigant\r\nhas previously asserted in the same or related proceeding.\" (citation omitted)). I\r\nwould affirm the second CSP judge's order, and find it unnecessary to rule on the\r\nappeal from the first CSP judge's order. I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\nBlakney pled guilty on November 6, 2008. At the sentencing hearing, the State\r\nrecommended Blakney receive a sentence of no more than five years. In doing so,\r\nthe State asked the sentencing court to suspend the minimum sentence of fifteen\r\nyears.10 See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-11-311(B) (2003) (\"Burglary in the first degree\r\n\r\n\r\n10Interestingly, fourteen months later, the same Solicitor's office that\r\nprosecuted Blakney took the opposite position at the plea hearing in Jacobs.\r\nSee 393 S.C. at 586, 713 S.E.2d at 622 (\"In January 2010, . . . . [t]he circuit\r\njudge deferred sentencing . . . and requested the parties submit memoranda in\r\n\nis a felony punishable by . . . . a term of not less than fifteen years.\"). In its\r\nappellate brief, the State wrote:\r\n\r\n              The [State] argues that [Blakney] was not given a thirty\r\n              month sentence but a fifteen year sentence. For a person\r\n              to be sentenced to burglary 1st you cannot receive less\r\n              than fifteen years. The court is obligated to impose the\r\n              sentence established by the General Assembly. It is clear\r\n              by the statute the General Assembly did not wish a\r\n              criminal defendant to receive a sentence less than fifteen\r\n              years for the offense of burglary 1st.\r\n\r\nAt oral argument, the State clarified its position on four separate occasions:\r\n\r\n              I think the sentence is illegal, your honor.\r\n\r\n              With all due respect, the sentence is fifteen years.\r\n\r\n              He would have to serve the eighty-five percent of fifteen\r\n              years.\r\n\r\n              I'm taking the position the sentence is fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe State is represented on appeal by the general counsel for the Department of\r\nProbation, Parole, and Pardon Services, who attempts to escape the inconsistency\r\nin the State's positions by arguing the State was represented by a different\r\nlawyer—the Solicitor—at the plea hearing. The argument fails. The State's lawyer\r\ntold the sentencing court it had the power to suspend the minimum sentence, and\r\nnow the State's lawyer tells this court there is no such power. I would hold the\r\nState is bound to accept the sentence it asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport of their positions regarding the suspension issue.\"). The Solicitor in\r\nJacobs filed a memorandum arguing, \"The State respectfully submits that it is\r\nnot within the power of a judge to suspend a burglary first[-]degree sentence\r\nand that doing so is contrary to the laws of the State of South Carolina.\"\r\nSimilarly, the Attorney General argued in its brief on appeal in Jacobs, \"The\r\ntrial judge properly determined Appellant's sentence for burglary in the first\r\ndegree . . . cannot be suspended under the plain and unambiguous language\r\nof S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-410.\"\r\n\nApart from the State's inconsistent positions, I would concur in the result reached\r\nby the majority. However, I do not agree that State v. Picklesimer, 388 S.C. 264,\r\n695 S.E.2d 845 (2010), applies to this case. In Picklesimer, the plea court\r\nsentenced the defendant to ten years in prison for criminal sexual conduct with a\r\nminor in the second degree, and then suspended the sentence to five years. 388\r\nS.C. at 265, 695 S.E.2d at 846. Section 24-21-410 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2013) provides the sentencing court the power to suspend sentences when\r\nthe crime is not \"punishable by death or life imprisonment.\" See also State v.\r\nThomas, 372 S.C. 466, 468, 642 S.E.2d 724, 725 (2007) (explaining the power\r\nconferred upon the sentencing court under section 24-21-410 \"does not extend to\r\noffenses where the legislature has specifically mandated that no part of a sentence\r\nmay be suspended\"). Thus, the suspended sentence in Picklesimer was proper\r\nbecause the crime did not carry life in prison and the applicable statute did not\r\nprohibit a suspended sentence. See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-655(D)(3) (Supp. 2013)\r\n(\"A person convicted of [criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second\r\ndegree] . . . must be imprisoned for not more than twenty years in the discretion of\r\nthe court.\").\r\n\r\nIn Blakney's case, however, the suspended sentence was not proper because the\r\nplea court had no power to suspend the sentence. See Jacobs, 393 S.C. at 588-89,\r\n713 S.E.2d at 623-24. In my opinion, the suspension of a sentence is not effective\r\nwhen the law forbids the suspension. See generally Talley v. State, 371 S.C. 535,\r\n546 n.6, 640 S.E.2d 878, 883 n.6 (2007) (Pleicones, J., dissenting) (stating \"if in\r\nfact the original sentence were unlawful\" because a magistrate court had no power\r\nto impose probation, \"then the suspension would be a nullity and Respondent\r\nwould be required to serve the original . . . sentence.\").11 Therefore, despite the\r\nlanguage on the sentencing sheet purporting to suspend the sentence, the sentence\r\ngiven was fifteen years, no portion of which was suspended. Because there was no\r\n\r\n\r\n11 The Talley majority did not reach the point Justice Pleicones addressed in this\r\nstatement because it was able to resolve the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\r\nissue before it by interpreting a completely suspended sentence as leaving\r\n\"absolutely no possibility the defendant will ever be incarcerated for the underlying\r\nconviction.\" 371 S.C. at 545, 640 S.E.2d at 883. Moreover, the magistrate court in\r\nTalley had the power to suspend the sentence, but the sentence was unlawful\r\nbecause the magistrate court had no authority to impose probation. 371 S.C. at\r\n544, 640 S.E.2d at 882. Our supreme court has not held that a trial court's partial\r\nsuspension of a sentence is effective even when the court has no power to suspend\r\nthe sentence.\r\n\nsuspended sentence, it is unnecessary for this court to consider the effect of\r\nPicklesimer.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion that Blakney received a fifteen year sentence with no suspension\r\nraises a concern as to whether he entered a voluntary plea. The majority's holding\r\nthat he must serve all fifteen years before he is no longer subject to revocation of\r\nhis community supervision raises the same concern. The State recommended the\r\nplea court sentence Blakney to a maximum of five years in prison. Under Jacobs\r\nand section 24-21-410, Blakney faced a minimum of fifteen years. The plea court\r\ncould not have given Blakney correct information about the sentence he faced if\r\nthe court believed it could suspend his sentence to five years. However, this\r\nconcern must be addressed in a post-conviction relief (PCR) action. See Roscoe v.\r\nState, 345 S.C. 16, 21, 546 S.E.2d 417, 419 (2001) (requiring a PCR applicant to\r\ndemonstrate that but for the erroneous statement from the plea court about the\r\npenalty he faced, he would have gone to trial); Dover v. State, 304 S.C. 433, 435,\r\n405 S.E.2d 391, 392 (1991) (finding a guilty plea involuntary in part because the\r\ndefendant did not understand the sentence he faced).\r\n\r\nI do not intend to suggest the State did anything improper in arguing to the\r\nsentencing court it had the power to suspend a minimum sentence for burglary in\r\nthe first degree. In fairness to the Solicitor, the 2008 plea occurred when many\r\nlawyers and circuit judges interpreted section 16-11-311 to permit suspending the\r\nminimum sentence. It was not until 2011 when the supreme court decided Jacobs\r\nthat it became clear the minimum could not be suspended. In fairness to the\r\ngeneral counsel for the Department, he is correct under Jacobs—Blakney did\r\nreceive a fifteen year sentence. In fairness to Blakney, however, he should get\r\nwhat was promised—a sentence of no more than five years.\r\n\r\nThe fact the State did not seek to correct the trial court's error is of no consequence.\r\nThe State is not aggrieved by the error—Blakney is. In fact, the State now\r\nembraces the error and seeks to benefit from it by claiming Blakney's sentence is\r\nfifteen years. The issue before us, however, is not a matter of \"correcting\" the\r\nerror. This appeal requires us in the first instance to interpret the sentence. In\r\ndoing so, I would hold the State to the position it took at the sentencing hearing,\r\nand find that Blakney can no longer be incarcerated on community supervision for\r\nthis crime.\r\n\r\nAs the majority aptly points out, and as I acknowledge, my proposed resolution of\r\nthis appeal does not fit perfectly with the situation the parties and the sentencing\r\ncourt created. However, the resolution I propose honors a fundamental cornerstone\r\nof the administration of criminal justice: participants in the system—defendants in\r\n\nparticular—are entitled to expect that the State will stand behind its sentencing\r\nrecommendations. While the sentencing court is never required to follow a\r\nrecommendation, when it does so, the State should not be permitted to later claim\r\nwhat it and the court meant was the defendant must receive a minimum of three\r\ntimes what it recommended as the maximum. That is precisely what the State has\r\ndone in this case. The Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services and\r\nthe Department of Corrections should at least recognize the inconsistency of the\r\npositions the State has taken in this case, honor the representations the Solicitor\r\nmade to Blakney in plea negotiations, and interpret the sentence in such a way that\r\nhe faces only a one-year revocation if he violates community supervision—not\r\neighty-five percent of fifteen years. See S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-560(C) (2007)\r\n(providing \"the court may revoke the prisoner's community supervision and impose\r\na sentence of up to one year for violation of the community supervision program\").\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5267","title":"Bagwell v.

At trial, Jarrett Armstrong testified he and his roommate Chris Snoddy\r\n(collectively, the victims) were on their way home from work one night, when he\r\nreceived a call from a neighbor that caused them to hurry home. Armstrong\r\ntestified that when they arrived, a large crowd was gathered outside their\r\napartment. According to Armstrong, he entered the front door of the apartment\r\nand saw Bagwell, whom Armstrong had known since elementary school, exiting\r\nthrough the back glass patio door, which was shattered. Armstrong stated he did\r\nnot see Bagwell's roommate, Daryl1 Spain, inside the apartment and he did not\r\npunch Daryl.\r\n\r\nArmstrong, however, testified he confronted Bagwell outside Bagwell and Daryl's\r\napartment and punched Bagwell in the face. According to Armstrong, Bagwell's\r\nface was scarred with \"blood coming down\" before Armstrong punched him. The\r\nState admitted a photograph of Bagwell taken after the burglary, which shows\r\nblood streaming down the left side of his face. On cross-examination, Daryl's\r\ncounsel asked Armstrong, \"This gash that [Bagwell] had on his forehead . . . isn't it\r\ntrue that [Bagwell] received that gash when you hit him on the forehead with a\r\nhandgun?\" Armstrong replied, \"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSnoddy testified he saw Daryl exiting the apartment through the glass patio door;\r\nhowever, he stated he did not see Bagwell inside the apartment. Snoddy further\r\ntestified Armstrong and Bagwell began fighting in front of Bagwell and Daryl's\r\napartment. Snoddy also stated Bagwell had \"blood or a scratch\" down his face\r\nbefore Armstrong punched him.\r\n\r\nBagwell testified in his defense.2 According to Bagwell, he was asleep in his\r\napartment at the time of the burglary, and he awoke to find Armstrong \"beating on\r\n[him]\" and accusing Daryl of breaking into Armstrong and Snoddy's apartment.\r\n\r\n1 Spain's name is spelled \"Darryl\" throughout the appendix; however, it is spelled \n\r\n\"Daryl\" on the South Carolina Department of Corrections website. We refer to \n\r\nhim as Daryl in this opinion. \n\r\n2 Daryl did not testify at trial. \n\r\n\nAfter Armstrong left his apartment, Bagwell called the police and reported that\r\nArmstrong had broken into his apartment. Bagwell testified he then looked outside\r\nand saw Armstrong beating Daryl and holding a gun to his head. Bagwell further\r\nexplained that his face was bleeding after the incident because Armstrong attacked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDuring its closing argument, the State asserted,\r\n\r\n               Some other testimony that's important for you to\r\n               remember.      If you remember both [Snoddy] and\r\n               [Armstrong] said that when they went over to [Bagwell]'s\r\n               apartment and he was out front, when they went over\r\n               there they both saw a scratch on his top eye and blood. A\r\n               little blood trail coming down the side of [Bagwell's]\r\n               face. Now how did he get that? How did [Bagwell] get\r\n               that? How did he get this right here? How did he get\r\n               this cut? One way he could have gotten this cut, ladies\r\n               and gentlemen, one way is if when he ran out, ran\r\n               through the glass in a hurry, see the arc on this glass? He\r\n               could have cut his eye when he was running out. When\r\n               [Armstrong] startled them when they came back.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the jury convicted Bagwell and Daryl of first-degree burglary. The\r\ntrial court sentenced Bagwell to twenty years' imprisonment and Daryl to fifteen\r\nyears' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Bagwell's PCR counsel introduced DNA test results indicating\r\nblood found on three pieces of glass recovered from the victims' glass patio door\r\ndid not match Bagwell.3 Bagwell alleged his trial counsel was ineffective for\r\nfailing to request DNA testing for the glass prior to trial.\r\n\r\nBagwell testified trial counsel never informed him the State had the blood samples\r\nat the time of his trial. Trial counsel admitted she knew the State had the blood\r\nsamples prior to trial, but she did not request DNA testing. Trial counsel explained\r\nthe State originally planned to test the samples, but another solicitor took over the\r\ncase and decided not to follow through with testing. Trial counsel admitted the test\r\nresults \"may have affected\" the outcome at trial; however, she stated the test results\r\nwould not have excluded the possibility of Bagwell's guilt. Trial counsel further\r\n\r\n3   The test results do not indicate who the DNA belonged to.\r\n\nstated that during its closing argument, the State \"probably\" displayed a picture of\r\nthe broken glass door in front of the jury. Finally, trial counsel asserted Bagwell's\r\ntrial was essentially a \"swearing match\" between the victims and defendants.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to seek DNA\r\ntesting of the glass prior to trial. To support its finding, the PCR court noted trial\r\ncounsel believed the State would be performing a DNA test prior to trial, and she\r\ndid not learn until \"much later\" the State would not be doing so. Moreover, it\r\nfound trial counsel made a reasonable decision to proceed to trial without the DNA\r\ntest because the results of the test could have damaged Bagwell's defense.\r\nAdditionally, the PCR court found no prejudice from trial counsel's failure to test\r\nthe glass because \"the fact that DNA from the bloody glass did not match\r\n[Bagwell] did not mean[] [Bagwell] could not have been in the victims' apartment\r\non the night in question.\" After the denial of PCR relief, Bagwell filed a petition\r\nfor writ of certiorari, which this court granted on July 8, 2013.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The petitioner in a PCR hearing bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to\r\nrelief.\" Walker v. State, 407 S.C. 400, 405, 756 S.E.2d 144, 146 (2014). \"This\r\nCourt will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is any evidence of\r\nprobative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR court\r\nwhen it is controlled by an error of law.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant\r\nmust prove trial counsel's performance was deficient, and the deficient\r\nperformance prejudiced the applicant's case. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\r\n668, 687 (1984). To show counsel was deficient, the applicant must establish\r\ncounsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing\r\nprofessional norms. Id. at 688. To show prejudice, the applicant must show that\r\nbut for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of the trial\r\nwould have been different. Id. at 694. A reasonable probability is a probability\r\nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial. Id. However, \"[a]\r\n'reasonable probability' is less than a preponderance of the evidence . . . .\" Weik v.\r\nState, Op. No. 27421 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 23, 2014) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No.\r\n29 at 42). \"This does not require a showing that counsel's actions 'more likely than\r\nnot altered the outcome,' but the difference between Strickland's prejudice standard\r\nand a more-probable-than-not standard is slight and matters 'only in the rarest\r\ncase.'\" Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 792 (2011).\r\n\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Failure to Investigate\r\n\r\nBagwell contends trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request DNA testing\r\nfor the pieces of glass prior to trial. He further argues he was prejudiced by trial\r\ncounsel's deficiency because the State implied to the jury throughout the trial\r\nBagwell cut his face running through the glass patio door and \"touted this as the\r\nlinchpin evidence to place [him] at the crime scene.\" We agree.\r\n\r\nCounsel has a duty to undertake reasonable investigations or to make a decision\r\nthat renders a particular investigation unnecessary. Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\nU.S. 668, 691 (1984). Thus, \"[a] criminal defense attorney has the duty to conduct\r\na reasonable investigation to discover all reasonably available mitigation evidence\r\nand all reasonably available evidence tending to rebut any aggravating evidence\r\nintroduced by the State.\" McKnight v. State, 378 S.C. 33, 46, 661 S.E.2d 354, 360\r\n(2008). Moreover, counsel's decision not to investigate should be assessed for\r\nreasonableness under all the circumstances with heavy deference to counsel's\r\njudgment. Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 597, 627 S.E.2d 701, 706 (2006).\r\n\"[A]t a minimum, counsel has the duty to interview potential witnesses and to\r\nmake an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.\" Ard\r\nv. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331-32, 642 S.E.2d 590, 597 (2007) (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted) (emphasis omitted). \"[C]ounsel's conversations with the defendant\r\nmay be critical to a proper assessment of counsel's investigation decisions . . . .\"\r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691. \"[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim\r\nmust judge the reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the\r\nparticular case, viewed as of the time of counsel's conduct.\" Id. at 690.\r\n\r\nWe hold trial counsel's failure to conduct DNA testing on the glass prior to trial\r\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel. First, trial counsel's decision not to\r\nseek DNA testing prior to trial was unreasonable because the State used the glass\r\nas circumstantial evidence of Bagwell's guilt. See Walker v. State, 407 S.C. 400,\r\n405, 756 S.E.2d 144, 147 (2014) (stating trial counsel has a duty to conduct a\r\nreasonable investigation or to make a reasonable decision that makes investigation\r\nunnecessary). Specifically, the State asserted in its closing argument Bagwell\r\n\"could have cut his eye when he was running out [the victims' glass patio door;]\"\r\ntherefore, the State used the glass as evidence that placed Bagwell at the crime\r\nscene. Moreover, the evidence was reasonably available to trial counsel because\r\nshe knew the State had the evidence prior to trial. See McKnight, 378 S.C. at 46,\r\n\n661 S.E.2d at 360 (\"A criminal defense attorney has the duty to conduct a\r\nreasonable investigation to discover all reasonably available mitigation evidence\r\nand all reasonably available evidence tending to rebut any aggravating evidence\r\nintroduced by the State.\"). Trial counsel's explanation that she did not request\r\nDNA testing because she believed the State planned to do so was unreasonable\r\nbecause criminal defense attorneys have a duty \"to make an independent\r\ninvestigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.\" Ard, 372 S.C. at 331-32,\r\n642 S.E.2d at 597 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Her duty\r\nto test the blood from the glass was especially important here because the test\r\nresults could have supported Bagwell's claim that he was asleep in his apartment at\r\nthe time of the burglary. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691 (stating counsel's\r\nconversations with the defendant may be critical when assessing counsel's\r\ninvestigation decisions). Although this court must give heavy deference to trial\r\ncounsel's decision not to investigate, we find trial counsel's decision to not seek\r\nDNA testing prior to trial was objectively unreasonable. Cf. Simpson, 367 S.C. at\r\n597, 627 S.E.2d at 706 (stating counsel's decision not to investigate should be\r\nassessed for reasonableness under all the circumstances with heavy deference to\r\ncounsel's judgment).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we hold trial counsel's failure to test the blood samples prior to trial\r\nwas prejudicial to Bagwell. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687 (stating a PCR\r\napplicant must prove trial counsel's performance was deficient and the deficient\r\nperformance prejudiced the applicant's case to establish a claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel). Initially, we note prejudice may be found because trial\r\ncounsel admitted the results of the DNA test \"may have affected\" the outcome of\r\nBagwell's trial. See Pauling v. State, 331 S.C. 606, 610, 503 S.E.2d 468, 471\r\n(1998) (noting a court may find ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel\r\nadmitted the testimony of a witness might have made the difference in obtaining an\r\nacquittal). Furthermore, the State's case against Bagwell was not strong. As trial\r\ncounsel explained, Bagwell's trial was essentially a \"swearing match\" between the\r\nvictims and defendants. The only direct evidence linking Bagwell to the burglary\r\nwas Armstrong's testimony that he saw Bagwell exiting the apartment through the\r\nglass door. However, the State referenced the broken glass door several times at\r\ntrial to corroborate Armstrong's testimony and infer Bagwell was inside the\r\nvictims' apartment. During its opening argument, the State asserted, \"The evidence\r\nwill show that after [Armstrong] entered[, Bagwell] became upset and ran out the\r\npatio glass door. The patio glass door which had been shattered moments before.\"\r\nAdditionally, the State admitted a photograph that shows Bagwell's face scarred\r\nwith blood streaming down the left side of his face, and Armstrong and Snoddy\r\ntestified Bagwell appeared that way before Armstrong punched him. The State\r\n\nalso introduced a picture of the broken glass door that the perpetrator ran through\r\nand a picture of the broken glass from the shattered patio door. Importantly, the\r\nState asserted to the jury in its closing argument,\r\n\r\n             Some other testimony that's important for you to\r\n             remember.      If you remember both [Snoddy] and\r\n             [Armstrong] said that when they went over to [Bagwell]'s\r\n             apartment and he was out front, when they went over\r\n             there they both saw a scratch on his top eye and blood. A\r\n             little blood trail coming down the side of [Bagwell's]\r\n             face. Now how did he get that? How did [Bagwell] get\r\n             that? How did he get this right here? How did he get\r\n             this cut? One way he could have gotten this cut, ladies\r\n             and gentlemen, one way is if when he ran out, ran\r\n             through the glass in a hurry, see the arc on this glass? He\r\n             could have cut his eye when he was running out. When\r\n             [Armstrong] startled them when they came back.\r\n\r\nAlthough the DNA test results indicating Bagwell's blood was not found on the\r\npieces of glass do not exonerate Bagwell or preclude the possibility of his guilt, we\r\nbelieve the jury more likely than not would have reached a different verdict had\r\nthis evidence been presented at trial. See Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770,\r\n792 (2011) (recognizing Strickland prejudice \"does not require a showing that\r\ncounsel's actions 'more likely than not altered the outcome,' but the difference\r\nbetween Strickland's prejudice standard and a more-probable-than-not standard is\r\nslight and matters 'only in the rarest case'\"). The evidence would have rebutted the\r\nState's theory that Bagwell cut his eye while exiting the victim's apartment through\r\nthe glass patio door. Furthermore, it would have cast doubt on Armstrong's and\r\nSnoddy's testimonies that Bagwell's face was bleeding before Armstrong punched\r\nBagwell. Likewise, the evidence would have supported Bagwell's testimony that\r\nhe was in his apartment at the time of the burglary and his face was bleeding\r\nbecause Armstrong attacked him.\r\n\r\nConsidering the lack of evidence other than Armstrong's testimony, the repeated\r\nreferences to the glass by the State, and the importance of witness credibility at\r\ntrial, we find that but for trial counsel's failure to test the blood samples, there is a\r\nreasonable probability the result of Bagwell's trial would have been different.4 See\r\n\r\n4Bagwell also claims he is entitled to a new trial because the DNA test results\r\nconstitute after-discovered evidence. Because we reverse the PCR court's finding\r\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694 (stating that to show prejudice, the applicant must show\r\nthat but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of the trial\r\nwould have been different). Accordingly, we hold trial counsel was ineffective for\r\nfailing to request DNA testing on the glass prior to trial.\r\n\r\nII.   Failure to Argue Rule 608(c), SCRE\r\n\r\nBagwell argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present the proper legal\r\nargument to the trial court, so that Daryl's brother, Jerry Spain, could testify\r\nArmstrong was angry with Daryl because Daryl revealed to a mutual neighbor that\r\nArmstrong was selling marijuana from his apartment. Specifically, Bagwell argues\r\nJerry's testimony was admissible under Rule 608(c), SCRE, to show Armstrong's\r\nbias and motive to fabricate the allegations against Bagwell and Daryl. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Daryl's counsel called Jerry to testify about statements Armstrong made to\r\nJerry two days after the burglary. The State objected, arguing Jerry's testimony\r\nwas inadmissible under Rule 613, SCRE, because Daryl's counsel failed to lay a\r\nproper foundation and did not ask Armstrong whether he made these prior\r\nstatements to Jerry. The trial court sustained the objection, ordered the jury out of\r\nthe courtroom, and allowed Daryl's counsel to proffer Jerry's testimony.\r\n\r\nDuring the proffer, Jerry testified he went to Bagwell and Daryl's apartment two\r\ndays after the burglary and found Armstrong standing outside his apartment. Jerry\r\nstated he was unaware Bagwell and Daryl had been arrested for burglary, and he\r\nasked Armstrong \"what went on.\" Armstrong told him Daryl broke into\r\nArmstrong's apartment. According to Jerry, Armstrong became angry when he\r\nfound Daryl in his apartment and he went over to Bagwell and Daryl's apartment\r\nwith a gun, \"[a]nd [Bagwell] was in the recliner and [Armstrong] said he hit\r\n[Bagwell] against the head with the butt of his gun.\" Jerry further stated\r\nArmstrong told him he then went outside the apartment, beat Daryl, and dragged\r\nhim around the apartment complex parking lot. Finally, Jerry testified Armstrong\r\ntold him he wanted to kill Daryl and was angry with him because he previously\r\ntold a resident at their apartment complex that Armstrong was selling marijuana.\r\n\r\n\r\nthat trial counsel was not ineffective and grant Bagwell a new trial, we decline to\r\naddress this argument. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\nS.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not\r\naddress remaining issues when a decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nThereafter, the trial court ruled Jerry's testimony was inadmissible under Rule\r\n613(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Bagwell asserted Jerry's testimony that Armstrong was angry\r\nwith Daryl for telling a neighbor that Armstrong sold marijuana would have\r\nprovided a motive for Armstrong to fabricate the burglary allegations against\r\nBagwell and Daryl. Trial counsel testified she interviewed Jerry, but she never\r\nintended to call him as a witness because there was \"some deviation\" between his\r\ntestimony and Bagwell's testimony. Trial counsel further testified she did not\r\nargue Jerry's testimony was admissible under Rule 608, SCRE; however, Daryl's\r\ncounsel argued the testimony was admissible under Rule 613, SCRE.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue Jerry's\r\ntestimony was admissible to show Armstrong's bias and motive to fabricate the\r\nallegations against Bagwell and Daryl. Specifically, it found Bagwell failed to\r\nprove prejudice because Jerry did not testify at the PCR hearing.\r\n\r\nWe find the PCR court did not err in finding trial counsel was not ineffective for\r\nfailing to introduce Jerry's testimony at trial. On direct appeal, this court held that\r\nany error in excluding Jerry's testimony was harmless because physical evidence\r\ncorroborated Armstrong's and Snoddy's testimony,5 and counsel for Bagwell and\r\nDaryl were allowed to cross-examine Armstrong and Snoddy. See State v.\r\nBagwell, Op. No. 2007-UP-377 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. 18, 2007). Because this\r\ncourt previously found that any error in excluding Jerry's testimony would be\r\nharmless, we find Bagwell has not shown that but for trial counsel's failure to\r\nproperly argue for the admission of this testimony, there is a reasonable probability\r\nthe result at trial would have been different. Accordingly, we hold the PCR court\r\nproperly determined trial counsel was not ineffective as to this issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we hold the PCR court erred in determining trial counsel was not\r\nineffective for failing to request DNA testing on blood found on glass recovered at\r\nthe crime scene. We further hold the PCR court properly determined trial counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n5We note with interest that the only physical evidence linking Bagwell to the\r\ncrime was the blood on Bagwell's face, which the State argued was from a cut\r\nBagwell received when he exited the apartment. However, the DNA evidence\r\nBagwell presented to the PCR court tends to refute that argument.\r\n\nwas not ineffective for failing to introduce Jerry's testimony at trial. Accordingly,\r\nwe reverse the denial of PCR and find Bagwell is entitled to a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: I concur with the majority's opinion that Bagwell was not\r\nprejudiced by his counsel's failure to properly argue for the admission of Jerry\r\nSpain's testimony. I also agree with the majority's finding that Bagwell's trial\r\ncounsel was deficient in failing to request DNA testing on the blood from the\r\nbroken glass found at the crime scene. However, I disagree with the conclusion\r\nthat Bagwell was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to request DNA testing on the\r\nblood from the broken glass found at the crime scene.\r\n\r\n\"In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant\r\nmust prove: (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under\r\nprevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced\r\nthe applicant's case.\" Porter v. State, 368 S.C. 378, 383, 629 S.E.2d 353, 356\r\n(2006); see also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). To show\r\nprejudice, the applicant must show that \"but for counsel's errors, there is a\r\nreasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different.\" Johnson v.\r\nState, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997). \"A reasonable probability is\r\na probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.\" Id. at\r\n186, 480 S.E.2d at 735; see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\r\n\r\nI do not believe Bagwell has shown his counsel's failure to request DNA testing\r\nprejudiced his case. At trial, the State produced witness testimony and\r\nphotographic evidence that Daryl Spain sustained multiple lacerations on the\r\nbottom of his feet on the night of the robbery. Snoddy also testified that Daryl\r\nSpain was barefoot when he exited the apartment through the shattered glass door.\r\nThe cuts on Daryl Spain's feet provide a reasonable alternative explanation for the\r\npresence of blood on the glass pieces collected from the scene. In fact, Daryl\r\nSpain's lacerations, which were likely inflicted when he attempted to exit the\r\napartment barefooted, are a more plausible explanation for the presence of blood at\r\nthe scene of the crime than the \"scratch on [Bagwell's] top eye.\" However, the\r\nblood on the glass collected from the scene was only tested for a match with\r\nBagwell's DNA; it was never tested for a match with Daryl Spain's DNA. Without\r\nalso proving the blood does not match with Daryl Spain's DNA, this evidence\r\nwould not necessarily exonerate Bagwell. Moreover, at his PCR hearing, Bagwell\r\n\nfailed to establish the bloody glass pieces later tested for his DNA were collected\r\nfrom the arch of glass remaining in the doorway, which was allegedly depicted in\r\nthe photograph entered into evidence by the State.6 The tested glass pieces could\r\nhave easily been collected from the shattered glass covering the apartment floor,\r\nwhich would have supported the State's version of events presented at trial.\r\nWithout further information to accompany the DNA testing results, the State's\r\ntheory of the case is unaffected by the DNA evidence because the bloody glass\r\ncould still be attributed to Daryl Spain's injuries. Accordingly, I find there is not \"a\r\nreasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different\" if this DNA\r\nevidence had been introduced at trial. Johnson, 325 S.C. at 187, 480 S.E.2d at 735.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this case was presented to the jury as a \"swearing match\" between the\r\nvictims, Armstrong and Snoddy, and the alleged burglars, Bagwell and Daryl\r\nSpain. This case turned on credibility, and the jury found the former to be more\r\ncredible than the latter. As noted in the majority's opinion, the DNA testing results\r\ndo not exonerate Bagwell or preclude the possibility that he participated in the\r\nburglary. Further, as explained above, the State's version of events is unaffected\r\nby the presence of blood that did not belong to Bagwell at the scene of the crime.\r\nThus, I would find Bagwell failed to establish that if his counsel had introduced the\r\nDNA results at trial, there is \"a reasonable probability the result of the trial would\r\nhave been different.\" Johnson, 325 S.C. at 187, 480 S.E.2d at 735.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, I would hold that Bagwell's case was not prejudiced by his\r\ntrial counsel's errors, and the PCR court properly dismissed his PCR application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6The photograph depicting the shattered glass doorway allegedly showing blood\r\non the remaining glass was not included in the record.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5268","title":"Tuten v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nJoel is an attorney licensed in Georgia. Starting at least in 1993, he maintained a\r\npersonal injury law practice in Atlanta. In 1996, he opened an office in Columbia,\r\nSouth Carolina. He advertised extensively in the yellow pages of phonebooks all\r\nover South Carolina under the name Joel & Associates. The ads purported to offer\r\nprospective clients \"All the Help the Law Allows.\" Joel was never licensed in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nOn October 18, 2003, Tuten sustained severe injuries in a motor vehicle accident in\r\nAiken County while riding as a passenger in a car driven by Clifton Still. After she\r\nrecovered, she saw Joel's ad in the Aiken phone book. Joel was the only attorney\r\nnamed and pictured in the ad. Tuten called the telephone number listed in the ad,\r\nand a non-lawyer investigator came to Tuten's home. The investigator interviewed\r\nher and provided her a contingency fee agreement, which she signed. The\r\nagreement provided, \"Client . . . hires Joel & Associates, P.A. . . . to represent us as\r\nlegal counsel for all purposes in connection with claims for damage arising out of\"\r\nher accident, and stated, \"Client will pay [Joel & Associates] an attorney fee of 33\r\n1/3 % of the total money recovered . . . .\" When asked at trial whom she\r\n\"ultimately decide[d] to hire as a lawyer,\" Tuten testified, \"Joel. Mr. Joel.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 2003, Joel's firm sent Tuten two letters on Joel & Associates\r\nletterhead, one of which thanked her \"for retaining Joel and Associates to pursue a\r\nrecovery in your claim for personal injury.\" That letter was signed by Heather\r\nGlover, an attorney then licensed in South Carolina whom Joel employed in his\r\nColumbia office.1 There is no evidence Tuten was aware of Glover's involvement\r\nin her case until she received this letter.\r\n\r\nIn May 2006, Joel decided to close his Columbia office. Joel tried to get another\r\nattorney to take all his South Carolina cases, but no attorneys were interested.\r\n\r\n1 Glover is no longer licensed to practice law. The supreme court placed her on\r\ninterim suspension on October 1, 2008, In re Glover, 380 S.C. 22, 667 S.E.2d 728\r\n(2008), and disbarred her on January 7, 2011. In re Glover, 390 S.C. 643, 704\r\nS.E.2d 347 (2011).\r\n\nGlover sent Joel an email dated May 14, 2006 stating, \"I talked to two other\r\nattorneys . . . about taking the cases and neither one of them is willing to take all\r\nthe cases.\" She wrote:\r\n\r\n             The only way I see this office closing on the 24th like\r\n             you want is if I keep the cases and work on them on my\r\n             own. It is not my first choice and I would not be\r\n             permanently opening an office on my own. But what I\r\n             am willing to do is take all the current cases and work\r\n             them to conclusion, giving you 1/3 of the generated fees.\r\n\r\nShe wrote that unlike the attorneys who declined to take the cases, she could\r\n\"handle them without having to get permission from the clients.\" This approach\r\ngave them, she explained, \"the better chance we won't loose [sic] them all together\r\n[sic].\" (emphasis added). Finally, she offered that if Joel could not \"get out of\r\npaying the phone bill\" for the \"1-800\" number, \"I would take any new cases\r\ngenerated on the same arrangement of giving you 1/3 of any fees generated.\"\r\n\r\nGlover sent Tuten a letter dated May 24, 2006 on Joel & Associates letterhead\r\nstating:     I am sending this letter to let you know that David Joel is\r\n             retiring from his South Carolina office. Since I have\r\n             been the attorney handling your case and will continue to\r\n             handle your case to conclusion, this change should not\r\n             affect you in any way. The Stat [sic] Bar does require\r\n             that I send you this letter advising you of the situation\r\n             and also advising you that Mr. Joel will receive 1/3 of all\r\n             attorney's fees generated on your case even though he\r\n             will no longer be open in South Carolina. The split in\r\n             attorney's fees does not in any way affect the amount of\r\n             money you will receive.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 2006—the final day for filing a claim before the statute of\r\nlimitations expired2—Glover filed a summons and complaint on Tuten's behalf\r\n\r\n2 See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-535 (2005) (providing a three-year statute of\r\nlimitations).\r\n\nagainst Still in the Aiken County Court of Common Pleas. There is no evidence\r\nJoel or Glover served the summons and complaint or took any other action to\r\npursue Tuten's lawsuit. In November 2007, the circuit court dismissed Tuten's case\r\nfor failure to prosecute.\r\n\r\nIn October 2009, Tuten sued Joel, his law firm, and Glover for malpractice.\r\nGlover, who by that time had left South Carolina, defaulted. Joel's law firm\r\ndeclared bankruptcy before trial and did not participate. At trial, both Tuten and\r\nJoel made directed verdict motions. The trial court granted a partial directed\r\nverdict in favor of Tuten, and denied Joel's motion. The jury returned a verdict for\r\nTuten in the amount of $275,000. Joel filed post-trial motions for judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict, new trial nisi remittitur, and new trial absolute, all of\r\nwhich the trial court denied.\r\n\r\n      II.    Tuten's Partial Directed Verdict Motion\r\n\r\nTo succeed on her legal malpractice claim against Joel, Tuten was required to\r\nprove: (1) she and Joel had an attorney-client relationship; (2) Joel breached his\r\nduty to her; (3) Joel's breach of duty proximately caused her some damages; and\r\n(4) the amount of her damages. RFT Mgmt. Co. v. Tinsley & Adams LLP, 399 S.C.\r\n322, 331, 732 S.E.2d 166, 170 (2012). The trial court granted a directed verdict for\r\nTuten on the first three elements. We review the trial court's decision—separately\r\nas to each element—by applying the same standard as the trial court. 399 S.C. at\r\n331-32, 732 S.E.2d at 171. We view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in\r\nthe light most favorable to Joel. Id. As to each element, we \"must determine\r\nwhether a verdict for [Joel] would be reasonably possible under the facts as\r\nliberally construed in his favor.\" Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C.\r\n444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006). \"[I]f the evidence yields more than one\r\nreasonable inference or its inference is in doubt\" as to any one of the first three\r\nelements, then the trial court should have submitted the issue to the jury and we\r\nmust reverse. RFT, 399 S.C. at 332, 732 S.E.2d at 171; see also Erickson, 368\r\nS.C. at 463, 629 S.E.2d at 663.\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial court correctly granted a partial directed verdict for Tuten.\r\nSpecifically, we find the evidence yields only one reasonable inference as to each\r\nof the first three elements—(1) Joel and Tuten had an attorney-client relationship\r\nat the time her lawsuit against Still was filed and when it was dismissed; (2) Joel\r\nbreached his duty to Tuten; and (3) Joel proximately caused at least some of her\r\ndamages—and it was not reasonably possible the jury would return a verdict for\r\nJoel.\r\n\n             A.    Attorney-Client Relationship\r\n\r\nThe first element Tuten was required to prove was the existence of an attorney-\r\nclient relationship. RFT, 399 S.C. at 331, 732 S.E.2d at 170; Rydde v. Morris, 381\r\nS.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009). We readily conclude the trial court\r\ncorrectly directed a verdict for Tuten on this element.\r\n\r\nJoel conceded at oral argument that once Tuten signed the fee agreement with\r\nJoel's firm, she entered into an attorney-client relationship with Joel, and therefore\r\nhe was Tuten's attorney at that time. Joel argues, however, he ended the\r\nrelationship when he closed the Columbia office and allowed Glover to take\r\nTuten's case. We disagree. An attorney may not end an attorney-client\r\nrelationship, and thus relieve himself of the duties arising under it, by unilaterally\r\ndeciding to allow another attorney to take responsibility for fulfilling those duties.\r\nRather, at a minimum, an attorney must communicate to his client his desire to\r\nwithdraw from their attorney-client relationship in such a manner that the client\r\nunderstands her attorney will no longer represent her.3 If the attorney does not take\r\nsuch action, the attorney-client relationship continues.\r\n\r\nWe find no evidence Joel took any action to end his attorney-client relationship\r\nwith Tuten. To the contrary, the only communication Tuten received came from\r\nGlover. Glover's letter informed Tuten \"this change should not affect you in any\r\nway.\" Significantly, Glover's letter stated, \"Mr. Joel will receive 1/3 of all\r\nattorney's fees generated on your case.\" Glover's letter contains no explanation of\r\nhow Joel could receive an attorney's fee for not being Tuten's lawyer.4\r\n\r\n3 The criteria for withdrawal are stricter after an attorney becomes counsel of\r\nrecord in a lawsuit. See, e.g., Rule 11(b), SCRCP (\"An attorney may be changed\r\nby consent, or upon cause shown, and upon such terms as shall be just, upon\r\napplication, by order of the Court, and not otherwise.\").\r\n4 We address below the legal significance of fee-sharing agreements between\r\nattorneys. Here, the significance is practical—the effect Glover's letter had on\r\nTuten. Joel argues Tuten necessarily understood from the letter that Joel would no\r\nlonger be her attorney. However, lay clients like Tuten correctly believe lawyers\r\nget paid for fulfilling—not withdrawing from—their responsibilities to their\r\nclients. Therefore, apart from the legal significance of a fee-sharing agreement, the\r\npractical significance of Glover's statement that Tuten must pay Joel is the opposite\r\n\nJoel argues Glover's letter informed Tuten that Joel was no longer representing her\r\nbecause it stated, \"David Joel is retiring from his South Carolina office.\" This\r\nstatement did nothing more than inform Tuten that her attorney—Joel—would be\r\nworking only out of his Atlanta office. Joel also argues Glover's sentence, \"I have\r\nbeen the attorney handling your case and will continue to handle your case to\r\nconclusion,\" indicated Joel was no longer her attorney. We disagree because the\r\nsentence relates only to Glover. At most, the sentence indicated Glover was also\r\nTuten's attorney. Viewing Glover's entire letter in the light most favorable to Joel,\r\nwe find the letter did not convey to Tuten that Joel would no longer be her lawyer.\r\n\r\nTuten called retired law professor John P. Freeman as an expert witness. Joel\r\nstipulated Professor Freeman was qualified as an expert in numerous specific\r\nsubjects, including \"professional duties in handling litigation for clients\" and\r\n\"duties owed by lawyers when withdrawing from representation.\" Professor\r\nFreeman explained that under basic concepts of professional responsibility, Joel\r\nremained Tuten's lawyer. First, he explained that because Joel had an agreement\r\nwith Glover to receive a portion of the fee generated on Tuten's case, he retained a\r\nduty to represent her. He testified:\r\n\r\n             My opinion is that he is accountable and I'll explain it\r\n             this way. . . . You don't get that fee in exchange for\r\n             nothing. At a minimum you have to assume\r\n             responsibility for what happens in that case. You want\r\n             the money? Fine. If something goes bad or there is\r\n             malpractice, guess what. You've got a problem because\r\n             you become accountable under our rules and that is—that\r\n             is absolutely key.\r\n\r\nSecond, Professor Freeman explained Joel never withdrew from his attorney-client\r\nrelationship with Tuten. He testified an attorney \"can't just walk away\" when he\r\nwants to cease representation, and Joel \"never disavowed that he was her lawyer.\"\r\n\r\nJoel counters Professor Freeman's expert testimony with two arguments, both of\r\nwhich we find disingenuous. First, Joel attempts to deny he had an agreement with\r\nGlover to share fees on Tuten's and other cases. Joel testified Glover \"mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\nof what Joel argues—it is that Tuten necessarily understood Joel would remain her\r\nlawyer.\r\n\nshe would pay a third of the fees that she received to us.\" Following up on this\r\nstatement, Joel testified on direct:\r\n\r\n             Q:    Now, you mentioned that [Glover] offered to share\r\n                   her fees with you on the cases that she took over\r\n                   and continued to handle. Would you require her to\r\n                   pay some portion of the fees to you as a condition\r\n                   of her taking those files?\r\n\r\n             A:    No.\r\n\r\n             Q:    Did you, in fact, receive any fees as a result of any\r\n                   of the files that [Glover] took with her?\r\n\r\n             A:    No.\r\n\r\n             Q:    So when a reference is made to a fee-sharing\r\n                   arrangement on the files that transferred out, there\r\n                   wasn't one, was there?\r\n\r\n             A:    No. She suggested that in an e-mail to me. There\r\n                   was never a written agreement about it.\r\n\r\n             Q:    So did you or did you not have a fee-sharing\r\n                   arrangement with Heather Glover - -\r\n\r\n             A:    Nothing - -\r\n\r\n             Q:    On the files that left?\r\n\r\n             A:    Nothing that was enforceable in any way.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the record reveals Joel's testimony—that he had no\r\nagreement to share fees with Glover—is not correct. The truth is his law firm,\r\nDavid C. Joel, Attorney at Law, P.C., filed a lawsuit against Wachovia Bank for\r\nmoney Joel claimed Glover misappropriated. The lawsuit was premised on the\r\nexistence of the very agreement that Joel attempted to deny at trial and continues to\r\ndeny on appeal. In the \"Verified Complaint\" Joel filed to initiate the lawsuit, he\r\nalleged:\r\n\n             In . . . May 2006 Joel & Associates . . . entered into an\r\n             agreement with Glover under which she would continue\r\n             handling representation of Joel & Associates' remaining\r\n             South Carolina cases with an agreement to split fees with\r\n             Joel & Associates.\r\n\r\nThe verification attached to and filed with the complaint states:\r\n\r\n             Personally appeared, David C. Joel, an authorized affiant\r\n             of David C. Joel, Attorney at Law, P.C., who after being\r\n             duly sworn, states that the facts alleged in the foregoing\r\n             Plaintiff's Verified Complaint are true and correct based\r\n             on my personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Joel was asked, \"And your statement on this lawsuit against\r\nWachovia is that you had a fee sharing agreement with Heather Glover; is that\r\ncorrect?\" He answered, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nJoel's testimony that he did not \"receive any fees as a result of any of the files that\r\n[Glover] took with her\" is likewise false. The truth is Joel received over $100,000\r\nof those fees from the proceeds of his lawsuit against Wachovia. While Joel did\r\nnot technically receive those funds directly from Glover, he received the funds\r\nonly because they represented fees Glover owed him pursuant to their fee sharing\r\nagreement.5\r\n\r\n5 Joel testified his Columbia office did not try cases, and referred cases they could\r\nnot settle on their own to one particular trial attorney, Pat McWhirter. Six of the\r\nchecks Joel alleged Glover misappropriated were written on McWhirter's firm\r\naccount. One of those six checks was written only three weeks after Joel closed\r\nthe office. This check conceivably could represent a settlement reached before\r\nMay 2006, and thus represent fees not covered by the alleged fee-sharing\r\nagreement. However, five of the six checks were dated at least two months after\r\nJoel closed his Columbia office, and two of the checks were dated in February and\r\nMarch of 2007. Moreover, Joel alleged in his complaint against Wachovia that\r\ntwenty-four additional checks Glover misappropriated did not come from\r\nMcWhirter's firm. Those checks were necessarily issued by firms Glover\r\nassociated, which under Joel's testimony could have occurred only after Joel closed\r\nthe Columbia office, or were issued directly to the firm by defendants or insurance\r\ncompanies, in which case Joel would have known of the settlement if it occurred\r\n\nWe find that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence in this\r\ncase—viewed in the light most favorable to Joel—is he had an agreement with\r\nGlover to share fees on Tuten's and other South Carolina cases.\r\n\r\nThe second argument Joel makes to counter Professor Freeman's testimony is that\r\nJoel did not lead Tuten to believe he was still her attorney after he closed his South\r\nCarolina office, and if Tuten had such a belief, there was an issue of fact as to\r\nwhether her belief was reasonable. This argument incorrectly frames the issue.6\r\nThe correctly framed issue is whether Joel took action to end the attorney-client\r\nrelationship that he concedes existed when Tuten signed the Joel & Associates fee\r\nagreement in 2003. On review of the directed verdict ruling that Joel did not end\r\nthe relationship, the issue is whether there is any evidence in the record upon\r\nwhich a jury could reasonably conclude Joel withdrew from his representation. As\r\nwe explained, there is no such evidence in this record.\r\n\r\nThe principle that an attorney may not unilaterally withdraw from an attorney-\r\nclient relationship without notice to the client is fundamental to the fiduciary\r\nnature of legal representation. See generally Ex parte Strom, 343 S.C. 257, 263,\r\n539 S.E.2d 699, 702 (2000) (\"Strong policy considerations dictate that a client . . .\r\nmust be unequivocally informed when an attorney intends to withdraw from\r\nrepresenting a party, for whatever reason.\"); Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C.\r\n442, 452, 248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978) (\"An attorney who undertakes the conduct of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore May 2006. It is indisputable, therefore, that almost all the checks Joel sued\r\nto recover came from settlements that occurred after he left South Carolina, and\r\nJoel's entitlement to the fees represented by those checks depended upon a valid\r\nfee-sharing agreement with Glover. We find nothing to the contrary in the May\r\n14, 2006 email.\r\n6 Even if this were the correct way to frame the issue, Professor Freeman explained\r\nthat Joel reasonably indicated to Tuten that he was still representing her by\r\nparticipating in an arrangement with Glover through which Tuten received \"false\r\nand misleading communications that tricked [Tuten] into believing that David Joel\r\nwas still her lawyer.\"\r\n\nan action impliedly stipulates to carry it to its termination and is not at liberty to\r\nabandon it without . . . reasonable notice.\").7\r\n\r\nThe contrary position—taken by Joel—that an attorney's uncommunicated choice\r\nto withdraw from representation is effective unless the attorney \"leads the client to\r\nbelieve he is still the lawyer\" is indefensible and fails as a matter of law. The\r\nposition is so rarely taken that courts have hardly ever been called upon to write\r\nabout it. In each instance we have been able to find where courts addressed Joel's\r\nposition, the court held an attorney may not unilaterally withdraw from\r\nrepresentation, but at a minimum, must take some action to communicate to the\r\nclient his intent to withdraw. See, e.g., Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle Bank,\r\n272 P.3d 635, 642 (Mont. 2012) (stating an attorney may not unilaterally withdraw\r\nfrom representation, but \"remain[s] in an attorney-client relationship\"—even after\r\njoining another law firm—in the \"absence of any affirmative steps\" by the attorney\r\nto withdraw); Garrett (formerly Matisa) v. Matisa, 927 A.2d 177, 178-79, 182\r\n(N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 2007) (holding \"[i]t is well settled that an attorney who\r\nwants to withdraw from representing a client must notify the client in advance\" and\r\n\"notify the client of the grounds for withdrawal,\" even in a situation where a client\r\n\"effectively disappeared\" and her attorney was unable to contact her); Mobberly v.\r\nHendricks, 649 N.E.2d 1247, 1249 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994) (stating \"an attorney is\r\nnot free to withdraw from the relationship absent notice to his client\" and \"[i]n\r\ndetermining when the attorney-client relationship is terminated, the court must\r\npoint to an affirmative act by either the attorney or the client that signals the end of\r\nthe relationship\"); Cardot v. Luff, 262 S.E.2d 889, 892 (W. Va. 1980) (recognizing\r\n\"[m]ost courts require that before an attorney can unilaterally sever the attorney-\r\nclient relationship, he must give reasonable notice to his client of his intention to\r\nwithdraw,\" and noting \"further requirement[s]\" are necessary \"[i]f the withdrawal\r\ninvolves a matter pending in court\"). Joel cites no cases to support his position.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is no evidence Joel took any action to end his attorney-client\r\nrelationship with Tuten, and thus no jury could reasonably conclude Joel withdrew\r\nfrom the representation. Rather, the evidence yields only one reasonable\r\ninference—Joel remained Tuten's attorney at the time the circuit court dismissed\r\n\r\n7 In Strom and Graham, the attorney in question was counsel of record in a pending\r\nlawsuit. Strom, 343 S.C. at 260, 539 S.E.2d at 700; Graham, 272 S.C. at 450, 248\r\nS.E.2d at 598. For purposes of the attorney's duty to communicate his intent to\r\nwithdraw to his client, that difference from these facts makes no difference.\r\n\nher lawsuit, and as her attorney, he owed her the duties attendant to that\r\nrelationship. The trial court correctly granted a directed verdict for Tuten on this\r\nelement.     B.     Breach of Duty\r\n\r\nAn attorney owes his client fiduciary duties, Spence v. Wingate, 395 S.C. 148, 160,\r\n716 S.E.2d 920, 927 (2011), and he must \"render services with the degree of skill,\r\ncare, knowledge, and judgment usually possessed and exercised by members of the\r\nprofession.\" Harris Teeter, Inc. v. Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C. 275, 282,\r\n701 S.E.2d 742, 745 (2010) (citation omitted). When an attorney agrees to\r\nrepresent a client for the purpose of filing a lawsuit on the client's behalf, the\r\nattorney's fiduciary duty requires him to take action to prosecute the lawsuit.8 The\r\nfailure to take any action under the circumstances of this case is a breach of the\r\nattorney's duty to the client. There is no evidence Joel took any action to prosecute\r\nTuten's lawsuit. Therefore, the trial court correctly granted a directed verdict in\r\nfavor of Tuten on this element.\r\n\r\nJoel contends it was unnecessary for him to personally take action to prosecute\r\nTuten's case because Glover was handling the case. In his brief, Joel states,\r\n\"Glover was the attorney who operated the South Carolina office,\" and while that\r\noffice was open, \"Tuten understood that Ms. Glover worked for Mr. Joel.\" The\r\nlegal consequence of Joel's argument is Glover was his agent. See 1 Ronald E.\r\nMallen & Jeffrey M. Smith, Legal Malpractice § 5:8, at 528 (2014 ed.) (\"A\r\nprincipal attorney, typically an owner or managing attorney, is responsible for the\r\n. . . conduct of employed attorneys . . . .\"). As we explained, Joel remained Tuten's\r\nattorney even after he closed his South Carolina office. To the extent Joel claims\r\nhe continued to rely on Glover to handle Tuten's case, Glover necessarily remained\r\nhis agent, and Joel remained responsible for her conduct. Joel asserted at trial\r\nGlover was negligent as a matter of law, and argues the same position on appeal.\r\nUnder Joel's agency theory, therefore, he is liable for Glover's breach of duty.\r\n\r\n8 There are circumstances—not present in this case—under which an attorney may\r\nchoose not to pursue a lawsuit without breaching his duty to his client, including:\r\n(1) the attorney determines there is not good legal and factual ground to support\r\nthe claim; see Rule 11(a), SCRCP (requiring a certificate by an attorney that any\r\npleading has \"good ground to support it\"); (2) the attorney effectively withdraws in\r\na timely manner; and (3) the client makes an informed decision not to pursue the\r\nlawsuit.\r\n\n             C.    Proximate Cause\r\n\r\nAlthough proximate cause is ordinarily a jury question, the court may decide\r\nproximate cause as a matter of law \"when the evidence is susceptible to only one\r\ninference.\" Pope v. Heritage Cmtys., Inc., 395 S.C. 404, 416, 717 S.E.2d 765, 771\r\n(Ct. App. 2011). Here, Joel's failure to take any action to prosecute Tuten's lawsuit\r\nagainst Still indisputably resulted in the dismissal of the lawsuit. Because Joel's\r\nfailure to fulfill his fiduciary duty to prosecute Tuten's lawsuit was as a matter of\r\nlaw the proximate cause for the lawsuit being dismissed, the trial court correctly\r\ngranted a directed verdict in favor of Tuten on this element.\r\n\r\nJoel argues, however, Tuten was not entitled to a directed verdict on proximate\r\ncause because there was disputed evidence regarding whether she could collect a\r\njudgment against Still. We find this argument unpersuasive for two reasons. First,\r\nour courts have never required a legal malpractice plaintiff to prove collectibility\r\nwhen the malpractice caused the dismissal of an underlying lawsuit. Joel has not\r\ncited a single case applying such a requirement.9\r\n\r\nSecond, Tuten conclusively proved she could collect at least some portion of a\r\njudgment against Still. Joel conceded at oral argument that Tuten had an\r\nautomobile insurance policy with uninsured and underinsured coverage. He\r\nfurther conceded the insurance policy would have been available to Tuten had she\r\nwon a judgment against Still. Thus, had Joel taken some action to prosecute\r\nTuten's claims against Still, Tuten could have recovered some money through her\r\ninsurance policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n9 Joel cites only a comment from the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing\r\nLawyers, which provides that in a legal malpractice action, \"the lawyer's\r\nmisconduct will not be the legal cause of loss to the extent that the defendant\r\nlawyer can show that the judgment or settlement would have been\r\nuncollectible . . . .\" Restatement (Third) of The Law Governing Lawyers § 53\r\ncmt. b (2010). The comment continues, \"The defendant lawyer bears the burden of\r\ncoming forward with evidence that this was so.\" Id. (emphasis added). Even if\r\nSouth Carolina courts were to recognize a collectibility requirement—which we\r\nfind is not necessary to decide in this case—the only authority Joel cites to support\r\nhis position required him to prove a judgment against Still was uncollectible,\r\nwhich he did not do.\r\n\nJoel also argues Glover was negligent as a matter of law, and her negligence was a\r\n\"superseding and intervening\" event that \"interrupted any causation link between\r\nany negligence that might have existed on\" his part. While it is true Glover was\r\nnegligent because she failed to take any action to prosecute Tuten's lawsuit against\r\nStill, Joel was negligent for the same reason. Thus, Joel's arguments addressing\r\nGlover's liability prove Joel is liable to Tuten as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nThe trial court correctly granted a directed verdict in favor of Tuten on the element\r\nof proximate cause because the evidence was susceptible to only one inference—\r\nthat Joel's negligence proximately caused at least some of Tuten's damages.\r\n\r\n      III.   Joel's Directed Verdict Motion\r\n\r\nJoel also made a directed verdict motion on Tuten's legal malpractice claim. For\r\nthe reasons explained above, we find the trial court correctly denied Joel's directed\r\nverdict motion.\r\n\r\n      IV.    New Trial Nisi Remittitur\r\n\r\nFinally, Joel argues he was entitled to a new trial nisi remittitur because the\r\nevidence presented at trial did not support the jury's award of $275,000 in\r\ndamages. We disagree and affirm the trial court's denial of remittitur. See James\r\nv. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C. 187, 193, 638 S.E.2d 667, 670 (2006) (stating\r\nthe trial court has discretionary power to deny a motion for a new trial nisi, and an\r\nappellate court will not reverse the trial court's decision absent an abuse of that\r\ndiscretion).\r\n\r\nTuten testified that as a result of the wreck, she suffered a broken vertebra, a\r\ncollapsed lung, three broken ribs, and a concussion; stayed in the hospital trauma\r\nunit for a week; and had to wear a back brace for more than a year. Her medical\r\nbills totaled at least $24,571.82, and she was on social security disability due to her\r\ninjuries. This evidence provided a factual basis for the jury's verdict, and\r\ntherefore, the trial court acted within its discretion in denying remittitur. See V.E.\r\nAmick & Assocs. v. Palmetto Envtl. Grp., 394 S.C. 538, 551, 716 S.E.2d 295, 302\r\n(Ct. App. 2011) (stating the trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a\r\nmotion for new trial nisi remittitur when \"the record contains adequate evidence to\r\nsupport the jury's verdict\"); Burke v. AnMed Health, 393 S.C. 48, 57, 710 S.E.2d\r\n84, 89 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating \"we employ a highly deferential standard of review\r\nwhen considering the trial judge's [denial of] a new trial [nisi remittitur]\" and \"as\r\n\nan appellate court, we sit neither to determine whether we agree with the verdict\r\nnor to decide whether we agree with the trial judge's decision not to disturb it\").\r\n\r\n      V.     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court correctly granted Tuten's motion for a partial directed\r\nverdict, correctly denied Joel's motion for a directed verdict, and acted within its\r\ndiscretion in denying Joel's motion for a new trial nisi remittitur. We AFFIRM.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurring in a separate opinion: I concur in the majority's\r\nconclusion that Joel failed to take the necessary action to withdraw from his\r\nrepresentation of Tuten. I further concur in the majority's observation that Joel\r\nadmitted he had an agreement with Glover to share fees generated from those cases\r\nconsidered \"open matters\" when Joel closed his Columbia office in May 2006. But\r\nI would end the analysis of this matter there and refrain from drawing the\r\nconclusion the majority draws regarding Joel's lawsuit against Wachovia, i.e., the\r\nlawsuit was premised on the existence of Joel's May 2006 fee agreement with\r\nGlover.\r\n\r\nJoel's Complaint asserted that Wachovia converted certain checks made payable to\r\nJoel & Associates by making payment on them to Heather Glover, who was \"not\r\nentitled to enforce the instruments or receive payment.\" While the Complaint\r\nundoubtedly references the May 2006 fee-sharing agreement, the record does not\r\nsubstantiate the conclusion that this agreement served as the basis for Joel's\r\nasserted right to recover converted funds. It is conceivable that, as Joel indicated\r\nin his testimony and Reply Brief: (1) the converted funds were fees generated\r\nfrom cases referred to other firms for litigation before Joel closed his Columbia\r\noffice; and (2) the Complaint's reference to the disputed fee-sharing agreement\r\nserved merely as background material explaining how Glover obtained possession\r\nof the disputed funds. For this same reason, I also depart from the conclusion that\r\nthe proceeds of Joel's lawsuit against Wachovia represented fees Glover owed him\r\npursuant to the May 2006 fee-sharing agreement.\r\n\r\nJoel testified on redirect examination that the alleged converted funds, which\r\nincluded funds sent by the McWhirter firm, had nothing to do with the\r\napproximately seventy-seven open matters Glover took with her when the\r\nColumbia office closed. The dates on the McWhirter checks are not, by\r\nthemselves, inconsistent with this testimony. Further, no other evidence in the\r\nrecord contradicts Joel's testimony. In fact, Glover's May 14, 2006 e-mail to Joel\r\n\ncorroborates Joel's testimony as it indicates that neither McWhirter nor the other\r\ntwo attorneys that Joel and Glover had previously worked with were willing to take\r\nany of the seventy-seven open matters without obtaining advance written\r\npermission from the clients.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
