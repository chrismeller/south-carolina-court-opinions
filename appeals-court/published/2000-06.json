Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHUFF, J.: A jury \r\n  convicted Cecil \"Tray\" Dempsey of first degree criminal sexual conduct with \r\n  a minor and the trial court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment. Dempsey \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial court erred in denying his mistrial motion. We affirm. \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nIn June 1997 Victim, then 10 years \r\n  old, informed his aunt that his mother's boyfriend had been sexually assaulting \r\n  him for the past year.(1) The boy's aunt, Patsy \r\n  Yocum, immediately took Victim to a physician to be examined for sexual abuse. \r\n  At the time, Victim lived with his mother and her boyfriend, Tray Dempsey. When \r\n  Yocum told her sister (Victim's mother) about the abuse, she moved out of Dempsey's \r\n  house for a short time but returned within days. Victim now lives with his father \r\n  in North Charleston.  \r\n   \r\nYocum filed a police report and Victim \r\n  described the assaults to an investigator and a DSS social worker. Victim also \r\n  told his father and his father's fiancee about the assaults.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn Orangeburg County grand jury subsequently \r\n  indicted Dempsey for first degree criminal sexual assault with a minor. The \r\n  case was tried before a jury on April 20-21, 1998. At trial, Victim testified \r\n  the abuse occurred in his room, Dempsey's room, the kitchen, and in a camper \r\n  at Dempsey's house. Victim testified he put toilet paper in his underwear to \r\n  ease the pain from the rapes. Victim further testified appellant \"jacked me \r\n  up against the wall and said if I told anybody that he would hurt me.\" Victim's \r\n  aunt also testified and stated she once overheard Dempsey yell at Victim to \r\n  \"shut his d--- sucking lips.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDr. Donald Elsey, a child sexual \r\n  abuse counselor, testified for the State as an expert in child sexual abuse. \r\n  Before trial, the defense moved to exclude Elsey's testimony, arguing it was \r\n  more prejudicial than probative and lacked a proper foundation. The trial judge \r\n  reserved ruling on the motion. Elsey testified he conducted approximately thirteen \r\n  counseling sessions with Victim and concluded Victim had been repeatedly sexually \r\n  abused. The solicitor then asked Elsey about the methods used to determine a \r\n  victim's credibility:  \r\n   \r\nQ: What do you do . . . to determine \r\n  that the child is telling the truth? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA: . . . We assess if a child is \r\n  believable, we assess if they've been coached, we assess to see if somebody \r\n  has told them- \r\n   \r\nDefense counsel: I've got an objection, \r\n  your honor. \r\n   \r\nThe Court: I'll allow him to answer \r\n  those questions, but I won't let him go any further than that.\r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ: Did you find any abnormal answers \r\n  or responses from Michael that would lead you to believe that he wasn't telling \r\n  the truth? \r\n   \r\nA: No, I did not.  \r\n   \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ: And what did you base that conclusion \r\n  (occurrence of sexual abuse) on? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA: Well, we look for certain things \r\n  when we're assessing the child to assess their credibility, to assess their \r\n  reliability . . . . One of the most obvious things is if a child tells you that \r\n  they've been sexually abused. Unfortunately, when a child says that, ninety-five \r\n  to ninety-nine percent of the time, that's the truth. And that's based not only \r\n  on my opinion, but it's based on the research. . . . \r\n   \r\nDefense Counsel: Your honor, I have \r\n  another objection. \r\n   \r\nThe Court: I'll let you cross-examine \r\n  him on the research. Overruled. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ: Just continue.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA: Okay, basically, as I've been \r\n  with Michael I've concluded that he was being reliable . . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring cross examination, Elsey reiterated: \r\n  \"As I mentioned, very, very rarely does a child say that they've been sexually \r\n  abused when they haven't been . . . .\" The trial court, sua sponte, then sustained \r\n  Dempsey's previous objection: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI'm going to sustain at this time \r\n  the defense's objection to this witness's previous testimony as to ninety-five \r\n  percent, I believe, a rate you gave as being truthful, as being unfair corroboration \r\n  and prejudicial to this defendant. Ladies and gentlemen, you are to disregard \r\n  the witness's testimony as to the percentage of truthfulness in these kinds \r\n  of cases.  \r\n   \r\nAt the conclusion of Elsey's testimony, \r\n  defense counsel moved for a mistrial, claiming Elsey's testimony usurped the \r\n  province of the jury and that the resulting prejudice could not be overcome. \r\n  The court denied the motion but gave a curative instruction to the jury. The \r\n  judge then explained that Elsey improperly commented on whether or not he believed \r\n  Victim:  \r\n   \r\nThe last question put to Dr. Elsey \r\n  solicited a response from him which . . . was not permissible. And . . . it \r\n  lent itself to whether or not the victim in this case was being truthful. To \r\n  paraphrase the question from the solicitor . . . did you perform certain tests \r\n  of the victim. Was there anything to indicate that he was not being truthful? \r\n  That type of questioning, we call it corroboration, is not allowed in a case \r\n  such as this. . . . The witness who testified as an expert is also allowed to \r\n  testify to what we call trauma or rape syndrome, if you will. Now, his testimony \r\n  should have been limited to that. However, in the last questioning to this particular \r\n  witness, he was allowed to comment on whether or not he believed the victim, \r\n  and that's not allowed.  \r\n   \r\nThe judge struck Elsey's last answer \r\n  from the record and informed the jury that \"his last answer to the State's question \r\n  that lent itself to whether or not there was any indication that the victim \r\n  was being untruthful, I want you to disregard that.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFollowing a short break, Dr. Elizabeth \r\n  Baker testified that she examined Victim for signs of physical trauma and found \r\n  none. She further testified this was not unusual, however, stating that \"[w]hen \r\n  you're talking about anal penetration, it is unusual to find any evidence of \r\n  trauma, especially if it's been more than three days from the . . . time that \r\n  the incident happened . . . . Most of the time you're not going to find any \r\n  kind of physical evidence like tearing or scarring, or anything like that.\" \r\n  \r\nVictim's mother, on the other hand, \r\n  testified for the defense. She stated she loved Dempsey, was still living with \r\n  him at the time of trial, and intended to stay with him. She also claimed Victim \r\n  had told her \"that he loves Tray and he wants to come home to me and Tray both.\" \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe jury convicted Dempsey and the \r\n  trial court imposed a 30-year sentence. This appeal followed.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDempsey argues the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to grant a mistrial following Elsey's testimony. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial \r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, \r\n  502 S.E.2d 63 (1998). Accordingly, a mistrial should not be ordered in every \r\n  case where incompetent evidence is received and later stricken from the record. \r\n  State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996). An instruction to \r\n  disregard incompetent evidence usually is deemed to have cured any error in \r\n  its admission unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable that, \r\n  notwithstanding such instruction, the accused was prejudiced. State v. Johnson, \r\n  334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d 795 (1999). Furthermore, the granting of a mistrial \r\n  motion is an extreme measure to be taken only where an incident is so grievous \r\n  that its prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way. Kelsey, 331 \r\n  S.C. at 70, 502 S.E.2d at 73.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDempsey correctly asserts Elsey's \r\n  testimony improperly vouched for Victim's credibility.(2) \r\n  See State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989) (testimony \r\n  of psychiatrist who treated child victim of sexual assault was improper where \r\n  psychiatrist answered \"yes\" to solicitor's question of whether, based on his \r\n  examination and observations of the victim, he was \"of the impression that [the \r\n  victim's] symptoms [were] genuine\"); State v. Morgan, 326 S.C. 503, 515, \r\n  485 S.E.2d 112, 119 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting State v. Milbradt, 756 P.2d \r\n  620, 624 (1988) (\"We have said before, and we will say it again, this time with \r\n  emphasis - no psychotherapist may render an opinion on whether a witness is \r\n  credible in any trial in this state. The assessment of credibility is for the \r\n  trier of fact and not for psychotherapists.\")). We conclude, however, that the \r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dempsey's mistrial motion. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn our view the trial court's curative \r\n  instructions during and immediately following Elsey's testimony sufficiently \r\n  cured any prejudice to Dempsey flowing from the improper vouching. In State \r\n  v. Dawkins, supra, our supreme court addressed the denial of a mistrial \r\n  motion under very similar factual circumstances. There, as here, a professional \r\n  treating therapist in a child sex abuse case improperly vouched for the victim's \r\n  credibility by answering affirmatively when asked his opinion as to whether \r\n  the child's symptoms of sexual abuse were \"genuine.\" Although the trial court \r\n  sustained his objection, Dawkins immediately moved for a mistrial. The court \r\n  denied the motion but instructed the jury as follows:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury \r\n  panel, people can't come in and give their opinions as to what they feel took \r\n  place. That's not appropriate. The only thing that witnesses can do is to come \r\n  in and tell you what they've seen and what they've observed. It's solely left \r\n  up to you, ladies and gentlemen, to make a determination as to the facts in \r\n  this case. So, you would please disregard the last statement made by this witness. \r\n  That's an encroachment on your province to decide this case based on what you've \r\n  seen and heard, free from anyone else's opinions.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDawkins, 297 S.C. at 393, \r\n  377 S.E.2d at 302.  \r\n   \r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, \r\n  the curative instruction given by the trial court, substantially similar to \r\n  that approved by the supreme court in Dawkins, cured any error in the \r\n  admission of Elsey's testimony because it \"was not of such magnitude to effect \r\n  the outcome of the trial.\" Id. at 394, 377 S.E.2d at 302. Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Dempsey's mistrial motion. \r\n  See id.; State v. Merriman, 287 S.C. 74, 82, 337 S.E.2d \r\n  218, 223 (Ct. App. 1985) (any prejudice resulting from SLED agent's testimony \r\n  concerning the very issue to be decided by the jury was corrected by the trial \r\n  court's \"very thorough\" curative instruction); see also State v. Craig, \r\n  267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d 306 (1976).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  Victim was \r\n  eleven years old at the time of trial. \r\n2.  To the extent \r\n  Dempsey argues Dr. Elsey's testimony was inadmissible rape trauma evidence subject \r\n  to analysis under State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993), \r\n  the issue is not preserved. See State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, \r\n  481 S.E.2d 118 (1997) (issues may not be raised for the first time on appeal \r\n  but must have been raised to the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); \r\n  State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (where an argument \r\n  was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial judge it is not preserved \r\n  for review). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3180","title":"Weatherford v.

(Client).(1) The action \r\n  was tried non-jury, and the circuit court determined a fee of $32,000 was earned \r\n  by Attorney, granting judgment for that amount on the theory of quantum meruit. \r\n  Client appeals. We reverse and remand. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY  \r\nAttorney and Client were neighbors, \r\n  but had no prior professional relationship. Client invented a generator-driven \r\n  \"hydro cooler\" to provide refrigeration for crops as they were harvested in \r\n  the field. Client leased this equipment to Vickery Farms (\"Vickery\") \r\n  for use in a Jamaican farming operation. Vickery did not make the lease payments, \r\n  so Client contacted Attorney to recover the equipment and the amount owed by \r\n  Vickery. Attorney brought an action in federal court to recover the equipment \r\n  and amounts due under the lease. Attorney claimed he needed assistance because \r\n  of the work load in federal court proceedings. For this reason, Client agreed \r\n  to retain associate counsel from another firm to assist Attorney. Client paid \r\n  associate counsel an hourly fee which is not involved in this dispute.\r\nAccording to Attorney, the parties \r\n  initially agreed to a flat fee of $10,000 for Attorney's work. Client disputed \r\n  this, claiming a contingency fee arrangement of 25% of the overdue lease payments, \r\n  which would approximate $10,000 only if Attorney successfully recovered the \r\n  $40,000 in unpaid lease revenue. \r\n   \r\nVickery contended the equipment was \r\n  illegally imported into Jamaica, precluding exportation to the United States. \r\n  Attorney believed this defense dramatically expanded the scope of the legal \r\n  work. According to Attorney, he discussed this with Client on numerous occasions, \r\n  and Client repeatedly assured him that he would be reasonably compensated for \r\n  the extra work. Under Attorney's view, no definite compensation arrangement \r\n  was discussed, and no additional fee was agreed upon between the parties. Unfortunately, \r\n  there was no written fee agreement.(2)  \r\n   \r\nEventually Attorney, Attorney's wife, \r\n  and Client spent a week in Jamaica. The expenses for the trip were paid by Client. \r\n  At the conclusion of the trip, the leased equipment was returned to Client. \r\n  Attorney estimated the value of the equipment to be $125,000. Client disputes \r\n  this, claiming the equipment was severely damaged in Jamaica. Attorney prepared \r\n  a bill which was introduced into evidence in the federal suit reflecting a fee \r\n  for the Jamaica trip of $5,000, based upon 40 hours billed at $125 per hour. \r\n    \r\nAttorney and associated counsel tried \r\n  the federal case for one week, resulting in a jury verdict of $40,000. The verdict \r\n  was set aside by the trial judge. During appeal, the case was settled for $12,000.(3) \r\n    \r\nAbout one year later Attorney sent \r\n  a letter to Client asking to be paid. He requested payment of a \"reasonable \r\n  fee\" which he calculated on the basis of 1/3 of his valuation of the recovered \r\n  equipment. When Client refused to pay, Attorney brought this action for breach \r\n  of contract. \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Attorney sought compensation \r\n  on the basis of contract and, by amendment at the conclusion of the testimony, \r\n  on the theory of quantum meruit. Attorney testified he did not maintain time \r\n  records for his work because he had never worked on an hourly basis, and did \r\n  not do so in this case. The only testimony as to the amount of time expended \r\n  on the case, other than the description of the work and the length of the federal \r\n  trial, was Attorney's estimate of 500 hours. He explained that if he had kept \r\n  track of his time, the fee would far surpass 1/3 of the value of the equipment \r\n  ($41,666).  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court held there was no \r\n  express contract between the parties. The court awarded a fee in the amount \r\n  of $32,000 based on the theory of quantum meruit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES PRESENTED \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDOES THIS COURT HAVE SUBJECT \r\n  MATTER JURISDICTION? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDID THE TRIAL COURT ABUSE \r\n  ITS DISCRETION BY FAILING TO DIRECT A VERDICT? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT \r\n  AN ERROR OF LAW BY FAILING TO CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN \r\n  THE PARTIES? \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. SUBJECT \r\n  MATTER JURISDICTION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe first address the question of \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction. Attorney argues Client failed to appeal the final \r\n  order because the Notice of Appeal referred to the order denying the motion \r\n  for reconsideration. \r\n   \r\nThis Court has previously held that \r\n  a mere clerical error in a Notice of Appeal does not warrant dismissal of the \r\n  appeal. See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 \r\n  S.C. 471, 458 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1995). In Charleston Lumber Co., the \r\n  court rejected the respondent's attempt to have the appeal dismissed on jurisdictional \r\n  grounds when the appellant neglected to appeal one of a series of cases tried \r\n  together. As in that case, Attorney demonstrates no prejudice as a result of \r\n  the omission. Though Client did not \"technically\" appeal from the trial court's \r\n  original order by referring to it in the Notice of Appeal, the Client did attach \r\n  a copy of the order to the Notice. Under these circumstances, we believe Client's \r\n  omission is of a clerical nature only and this Court has jurisdiction to hear \r\n  the appeal.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. SCOPE \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nAn ordinary suit to recover attorney's \r\n  fees, even one based on an implied contract asserting a quantum meruit measure \r\n  of recovery, is an action at law. Lester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 268, \r\n  491 S.E.2d 240, 242 (1997) (\"An action by an attorney for compensation, whether \r\n  on a written contingency agreement or on a quasi-contractual obligation to \r\n  pay the reasonable value of services prior to its breach, sounds in contract. \r\n  The proper form of action by which to enforce payment, generally, is by an action \r\n  at law on the contract. . . .\") (emphasis added) (citation omitted); see \r\n  also Singleton v. Collins, 251 S.C. 208, 161 S.E.2d 246 (1968) (wherein \r\n  action to recover attorney's fees on theory of implied contract was at law). \r\n  This appeal, therefore, is governed by the \"any evidence\" standard of review. \r\n  See American Fed. Bank, FSB v. Number One Main Joint Venture, \r\n  321 S.C. 169, 173, 467 S.E.2d 439, 441 (1996) (in an appeal of a non-jury action \r\n  at law, the trial court's factual findings will not be disturbed \"unless found \r\n  to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings\") (citation \r\n  omitted); Singleton, 251 S.C. at 211, 161 S.E.2d at 247 (in attorney's \r\n  claim against client for professional services rendered, \"no appeal lies therefrom \r\n  if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence\").  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDID THE TRIAL \r\n  COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY FAILING TO DIRECT A VERDICT? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nClient asserts the trial court should \r\n  have directed a verdict. We first note the trial court found that there was \r\n  no express contract between the parties. There is no appeal from this \r\n  finding, and it is, therefore, the law of this case. See Brading v. \r\n  County of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107, 490 S.E.2d 4 (1997). Having found no \r\n  express contract, the court concluded attorney was entitled to recover the reasonable \r\n  value of the services rendered, a proposition which finds ample support in our \r\n  case law. See Singleton v. Collins, 251 S.C. 208, 161 S.E.2d 246 \r\n  (1968). \r\n   \r\nIn ruling on motions for directed \r\n  verdict, \"the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences \r\n  that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party \r\n  opposing the motions.\" Creech v. S.C. Wildlife and Marine Resources Dep't, \r\n  328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997). The trial court must deny the motions \r\n  when \"the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.\" \r\n  Id. This Court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence \r\n  to support the ruling below. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe conclude Client would only have \r\n  been entitled to a directed verdict if the evidence, and all of the inferences \r\n  which could be drawn from it, point to the singular position advanced by the \r\n  Client; that is, that the parties entered into a 25% contingency fee based solely \r\n  on the successful recovery of lost revenues. However, the unappealed ruling \r\n  that there was no contract is the law of this case. Therefore, this argument \r\n  is without merit. \r\n   \r\nDID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT \r\n  AN ERROR OF LAW BY FAILING TO CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN \r\n  THE PARTIES? \r\n   \r\nClient next argues the trial judge \r\n  declined to consider the ethical and public policy considerations implicated \r\n  by the attorney-client relationship. Client urges this court to hold that Rule \r\n  1.5, Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR, proclaims the public \r\n  policy of this State with regard to attorney fees in an attorney-client relationship, \r\n  and a failure to consider the criteria set forth in RPC Rule 1.5 in determining \r\n  a reasonable fee constituted an error of law.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nIn determining the fee, the trial \r\n  court specifically enumerated the six factors set forth in Blumberg v. Nealco, \r\n  Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 427 S.E.2d 659 (1993). In that case, our supreme court \r\n  ruled that a trial court should consider the following factors when determining \r\n  an award of attorney fees:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1) nature, extent, and difficulty \r\n  of the legal services rendered; 2) time and labor devoted to the case; 3) professional \r\n  standing of counsel; 4) contingency of compensation; 5) fee customarily charged \r\n  in the locality for similar services; and 6) beneficial results obtained.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 494, 427 S.E.2d at \r\n  660. Attorney maintains that once the court determined there was no express \r\n  contract, the court correctly based its determination of the fee on the factors \r\n  set out in Blumberg.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe question of what factors should \r\n  be considered when determining a reasonable attorney fee in an attorney/client \r\n  relationship has not been definitively addressed in South Carolina. The interrelationship \r\n  between the ethical rules governing the conduct of attorneys and the substantive \r\n  law is a subject which has historically created difficulty for courts. Client \r\n  argues that this court should enforce the Rules of Professional Conduct as the \r\n  public policy of this State, ruling that a fee agreement which violates the \r\n  Rules is unenforceable. There are states which have reached this conclusion. \r\n  See, e.g., Swafford v. Harris, 967 S.W.2d 319 (Tenn. 1998); Alexander \r\n  v. Inman, 903 S.W.2d 686 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHowever, in the recent case of Smith \r\n  v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612 \r\n  (1996), our supreme court chose not to adopt our Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  as substantive law in the setting of an action for legal malpractice. The court \r\n  determined the RPC may be relevant and admissible evidence in assessing the \r\n  legal duty of an attorney in a malpractice action, provided the specific rule \r\n  was intended to protect a person in the plaintiff's position or is addressed \r\n  to the particular harm. However, the Court did not say that a violation of the \r\n  Rules is negligence per se, or evidence of recklessness. We, therefore, conclude \r\n  that our supreme court has not ruled that a fee agreement which violates Rule \r\n  1.5, RPC, is unenforceable in all circumstances as against public policy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis does not mean, however, that \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct have no bearing on the issue. The Blumberg \r\n  factors were established by our supreme court to determine the fee to be awarded \r\n  against an adverse party when authorized by contract or by statute. Blumberg, \r\n  at 493, 427 S.E.2d at 660 (citing Collins v. Collins, 239 S.C. 170, 122 \r\n  S.E.2d 1 (1961) (involved an award of attorney fees to the wife against the \r\n  husband in a divorce case)). Not all Blumberg factors are relevant in \r\n  determining a reasonable fee to be paid by a client. As our supreme court stated \r\n  in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991), \r\n  the factor \"contingency of compensation\" does not refer to the nature of the \r\n  fee agreement. Rather, \"the contingency to be considered is whether the party \r\n  on whose behalf the services were rendered will be able to pay the attorney's \r\n  fee if an award is not made.\" Id. This consideration obviously contemplates \r\n  an award against another party, and is not pertinent to the assessment of a \r\n  reasonable fee in an attorney-client setting.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMore importantly, there are factors \r\n  which we conclude must be considered in assessing a reasonable fee in an attorney/client \r\n  setting which are not included in a Blumberg analysis. Specifically, \r\n  as Client asserts, the Blumberg factors do not take into account the \r\n  special nature of the attorney-client relationship. We conclude all of the circumstances \r\n  surrounding the attorney-client relationship must be considered when determining \r\n  a reasonable fee to be paid by a client. See Royal Crown Bottling \r\n  Co. v. Chandler, 226 S.C. 94, 83 S.E.2d 745 (1954). The failure to consider \r\n  these circumstances is error. \r\nAn attorney/client relationship is \r\n  by nature a fiduciary one. Royal Crown Bottling Co., at 105-106, 83 S.E.2d \r\n  at 751; Hotz v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 403 S.E.2d 634 (1991); In re: \r\n  Green, 291 S.C. 523, 354 S.E.2d 557 (1987). The relationship of an attorney \r\n  with his or her client is \"highly fiduciary in its nature and of a very delicate, \r\n  exacting and confidential character, requiring a high degree of fidelity and \r\n  good faith.\" 7 AmJur 2d Attorneys at Law Â§137 (1997). Historically, fee arrangements \r\n  between an attorney and client are \"examined with utmost care by the courts \r\n  in order to avoid any improper advantage to the attorney.\" Royal Crown Bottling \r\n  Co., 226 S.C. at 105, 83 S.E.2d at 750; Alexander v. Inman, 903 S.W.2d \r\n  686 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995). As the Florida Supreme Court stated:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLawyers are officers of the court. \r\n  The court is an instrument of society for the administration of justice. Justice \r\n  should be administered economically, efficiently, and expeditiously. The attorney's \r\n  fee is, therefore, a very important factor in the administration of justice, \r\n  and if it is not determined with proper relation to that fact it results in \r\n  a species of social malpractice that undermines the confidence of the public \r\n  in the bench and bar. It does more than that; it brings the court into disrepute \r\n  and destroys its power to perform adequately the function of its creation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBaruch v. Giblin, 164 So. \r\n  831, 833 (Fla. 1935).  \r\n\r\nRule 1.5, RPC, provides guidance \r\n  to the bar in determining a reasonable fee, and provides a starting point in \r\n  this analysis. See Singleton v. Collins, 251 S.C. 208, 161 S.E.2d \r\n  246 (1968) (noting with approval that the lower court, in arriving at the amount \r\n  of the fee, considered the evidence as to the time actually consumed, the services \r\n  performed and the nature thereof in the light of Canon 12, Supreme Court Rule \r\n  33); Glasscock, 304 S.C. at 160, 403 S.E.2d at 315 (holding a contingent \r\n  fee in a domestic case based on the amount of alimony, support or property settlement \r\n  awarded was unenforceable because it violated Rule 407 (1.5)(d)(1), SCACR); \r\n  Cf. Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. \r\n  433, 472 S.E.2d 612 (1996) (holding the RPC may be relevant and admissible in \r\n  a legal malpractice action in assessing the legal duty of an attorney, provided \r\n  the Bar Rule involved was intended to protect a person in the plaintiff's position \r\n  or be addressed to the particular harm). The criteria listed in Rule 1.5 are \r\n  in accord with the factors overwhelmingly accepted as appropriate considerations \r\n  in the vast majority of states. See 7A C.J.S. Attorney and Client, Â§ \r\n  325 (1980).  \r\n   \r\nSignificantly, Rule 1.5(a)(6) lists \r\n  \"the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client\" as \r\n  a factor to be considered. Rule 1.5(a)(6), Rule 407, SCACR. In an analysis similar \r\n  to that involved in this case, the Florida Supreme Court observed: \"Unlike an \r\n  award of attorney's fees to a prevailing party, a quantum meruit award must \r\n  take into account the actual value of the services to the client.\" Searcy, \r\n  Denney, Scarola, Barnhart &amp; Shipley, P.A. v. Poletz, 652 So.2d 366, \r\n  369 (Fla. 1995). Cf. Stringer Oil Co., Inc. v. Bobo, 320 S.C. \r\n  369, 465 S.E.2d 366 (Ct. App. 1995); Galanis v. Lyons &amp; Truitt, 715 \r\n  N.E.2d 858 (Ind. 1999). \"Thus, while the time reasonably devoted to the representation \r\n  and a reasonable hourly rate are factors to be considered in determining a proper \r\n  quantum meruit award, the court must consider all relevant factors surrounding \r\n  the professional relationship to ensure that the award is fair to both the attorney \r\n  and client.\" Searcy, at 369.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude \r\n  that the award of a fee based solely upon the Blumberg factors, without \r\n  regard to the circumstances surrounding the professional relationship, was error \r\n  requiring reversal. \r\n   \r\nClient raises one further argument \r\n  which we address because it may arise again upon remand. Attorney requested \r\n  a fee based on his success in securing the return of the equipment. Attorney \r\n  claims that calculating the reasonable fee on the basis of 1/3 of the value \r\n  of the returned equipment provides a proper method for weighing the amount in \r\n  controversy and the results obtained, and is not a contingency fee because it \r\n  does not depend upon the outcome. Client asserts that is improper because it \r\n  is a contingent fee.(5)\r\n \r\nIt is unnecessary to resolve this \r\n  issue. Attorney undertook representation to recover the equipment. He obtained \r\n  that result. There is no basis for enhancing the fee merely because the outcome \r\n  was successful. See 7A C.J.S. Attorney &amp; Client, Â§ 324 (1980) (\"The \r\n  measure of compensation is the reasonable value of the services rendered in \r\n  themselves, and not the benefits to the client. . . although. . . the benefits \r\n  or results secured may be considered as bearing on the efficiency of the services \r\n  and thus on their reasonable value.\"). Consequently, a fee based upon the formula \r\n  proposed by Attorney is improper under these facts.(6)\r\n  \r\n \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur. \r\n1.  \r\nAttorney sought judgment against William \r\nPrice as well as against William Price, Inc. However, the trial court concluded \r\nWilliam Price was not individually liable, and that finding is not appealed. For \r\nease of understanding, we refer to William Price and William Price, Inc. interchangeably \r\nas \"Client\" throughout this opinion. \r\n2.  \r\nThe burden is upon the attorney to make \r\nsure the client understands the fee arrangement. See Royal Crown Bottling \r\nCo. v. Chandler, 226 S.C. 94, 83 S.E.2d 745 (1954); see also Coley \r\nv. Coley, 94 S.C. 383, 77 S.E. 49 (1913); Rule 1.5 (b), Rules of Professional \r\nConduct, Rule 407, SCACR (\"When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, \r\nthe basis or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in \r\nwriting, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.\"). \r\n\r\n3.  \r\nThe amount of the settlement is not \r\nclear from this record. In the brief, Client stated that the amount of the settlement \r\nwas $12,000, which would provide a 25% contingency fee of $3,000. However, Client \r\nargued in the brief that Attorney should be limited to a contingency fee of $1,000. \r\nAscertaining the correct amount is not necessary in view of our resolution of \r\nthe issues. \r\n4.  Rule 1.5, \r\n  RPC, reads in applicable part as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(a) A lawyer's fee shall be reasonable. \r\n  The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include \r\n  the following: \r\n   \r\n(1) The time and labor required, \r\n  the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite \r\n  to perform the legal service properly; \r\n   \r\n(2) The likelihood that the acceptance \r\n  of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(3) The fee customarily charged in \r\n  the locality for similar legal services; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(4) The amount involved and the results \r\n  obtained; \r\n   \r\n(5) The time limitations imposed \r\n  by the client or by the circumstances; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(6) The nature and length of the \r\n  professional relationship with the client; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(7) The experience, reputation, and \r\n  ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 1.5(a), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n5.  Courts are \r\n  divided on this point. In Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  313 (1991) our supreme court rejected the argument made by Attorney, although \r\n  the ruling is based on the specific wording of Rule 1.5, which precludes a fee \r\n  contingent upon amount or outcome in a domestic case. See also \r\n  Matter of Estate of Jones, 329 S.C. 97, 103, 495 S.E.2d 450, 453 (1998) \r\n  (\"A contingent fee is one which is made to depend upon the success or failure \r\n  in the effort to enforce a supposed right, whether doubtful or not.\") (citation \r\n  omitted); cf. Eckell v. Wilson, 597 A.2d 696, 700-701 (Pa. Super. \r\n  Ct. 1991) appeal denied, 607 A.2d 253 (Pa. 1992) (\"In this situation, \r\n  the fee is not truly contingent on the outcome of the case because the attorneys \r\n  are paid regardless of the outcome of the litigation. In essence, they are exacting \r\n  a fee based on their performance during the course of the litigation. A contingency \r\n  fee arrangement carries a risk that an attorney will not be paid if the outcome \r\n  of the litigation is unsuccessful. No such risk is found here.\"); Muldoon \r\n  v. West End Chevrolet, Inc., 153 N.E.2d 887 (Mass. 1958); In re Marriage \r\n  of Malec, 562 N.E.2d 1010 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990) appeal denied, 567 \r\n  N.E.2d 333 (Ill. 1991); Head v.

Our ruling \r\n  is based on the facts of this case, and is not intended to encompass situations \r\n  in which courts have historically employed a multiplier, often referred to as \r\n  the \"Lodestar\" approach. Typically, these situations involve an attorney working \r\n  on a contingency fee arrangement who is terminated without fault prior to recovery, \r\n  or in a setting in which fees are assessed against the adversary.

Plaintiffs \r\n  Cornelius Joubert and The Pines of McCormick, Inc. appeal. We affirm.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDSS issued a group foster care license to Cornelius \r\n  Joubert, the Director of The Pines, a residential treatment facility for emotionally \r\n  disturbed teenaged girls in McCormick. Legal custody of the teenagers remained \r\n  with DSS, but Joubert, his wife Genevieve, and The Pines staff supervised them \r\n  twenty-four hours a day. On December 28, 1993, DSS transferred Edwina Daniels, \r\n  a deeply-troubled seventeen-year-old, from a \"maximum security\" foster care \r\n  facility to the less-restrictive facility run by Joubert. In addition to anti-social \r\n  behavior and \"attitude\" problems, Daniels had a long history of running away \r\n  from various placements.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1994, slightly more than a month \r\n  after her arrival, Daniels ran away from The Pines for an eight-day period. \r\n  Joubert permitted her conditional return with the understanding she would not \r\n  be readmitted if she fled the facility again. A few days later, Daniels threatened \r\n  a fellow resident with a pair of scissors and proclaimed her intent to burn \r\n  The Pines down. On February 14, one week after returning to the facility, Daniels \r\n  again left The Pines without permission. She surfaced two days later in the \r\n  custody of the local sheriff's department.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoubert informed DSS on February 16 that Daniels \r\n  had returned from this unauthorized absence, but she would not be readmitted \r\n  to The Pines out of concern for the other girls' safety. Because her foster-care \r\n  worker was in the midst of changing jobs, DSS pleaded with Joubert to keep Edwina \r\n  until the following morning. Although the substance of the parties' eventual \r\n  agreement remains in controversy, it is undisputed Joubert's son drove Daniels \r\n  and another seventeen-year-old runaway to a local motel, where they remained \r\n  overnight without adult supervision. The following day, they were returned to \r\n  The Pines to collect their belongings and turned over to a DSS caseworker.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDSS received a report on March 18, which alleged \r\n  neglect and lack of supervision against Joubert stemming from this incident. \r\n  During the subsequent DSS investigation, Joubert admitted leaving the juveniles \r\n  at the motel and stated he saw nothing wrong in doing so. On April 29, DSS found \r\n  the case \"indicated\" for neglect and lack of supervision. DSS advised Joubert \r\n  of its decision on May 18, and on May 24, Joubert requested a \"fair hearing.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy letter dated June 15, a DSS appeals examiner \r\n  notified Joubert that a fair hearing had been scheduled for July 20, 1994 at \r\n  10:00 am. Joubert appeared on the appointed day, but he was advised the hearing \r\n  had been continued. Thereafter, on August 10, Joubert received a subpoena to \r\n  appear for the re-scheduled hearing at 10:00 am on August 31. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interim, on June 21, 1994, DSS informed \r\n  Joubert by letter it was denying his application for renewal of his license \r\n  to operate a residential group care facility. This decision, issued without \r\n  notice or an opportunity to be heard, violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-2260 (1985 \r\n  &amp; Supp. 1999) (\"The Department [of Social Services] may revoke the license \r\n  of any child welfare agency which fails to maintain the proper standards of \r\n  care and service to children in its charge or which violates any provision of \r\n  this subarticle. No license shall be revoked or its renewal refused except upon \r\n  thirty days' written notice thereof. Upon appeal from such revocation or refusal \r\n  to renew a license, the Department shall, after thirty days' written notice \r\n  thereof, hold a hearing, at which time the agency shall be given an opportunity \r\n  to present testimony and confront witnesses.\"). \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DSS appeals examiner held an institutional abuse \r\n  hearing as scheduled on August 31, concerning the indicated report and subsequent \r\n  entry of Joubert's name in the DSS Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect. \r\n  At the hearing, Joubert appeared with his attorney and, in addition to objecting \r\n  to the \"indicated\" finding of abuse by DSS, objected to \"the refusal of this \r\n  [Department] to renew the license as of April the 1st, 1994.\" DSS \r\n  counsel responded: \"The issues or anything about the revocation of a license, \r\n  is not before this hearing examiner today. The only, this is pursuant to the \r\n  Joubert's appeal of their indicated case of, excuse me, Mr. Joubert's appeal, \r\n  of this indicated case of neglect and lack of supervision.\"\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 1994, Joubert's attorney wrote \r\n  the Director of DSS, Samuel Griswold, outlining the procedural problems experienced \r\n  by Joubert in obtaining a hearing and reiterating Joubert's intent to appeal \r\n  the non-renewal of his operating license. Leo Richardson, DSS Director of Individual \r\n  and Provider Rights, answered by letter dated September 23, which stated: \"I \r\n  have noted that all of the objections and concerns you raised were also part \r\n  of the [hearing] record. Therefore, all of your concerns will be directly addressed \r\n  in the fair hearing decision.\" The same day, however, the appeals examiner from \r\n  the August 31 hearing replied with a separate letter: \"Your letter dated September \r\n  6, 1994 has been considered as the written request for a fair hearing involving \r\n  the denial of relicensure for the Pines of McCormick. As you have thirty (30) \r\n  days from June 21, 1994 (the date you were informed that the Pines of McCormick \r\n  was denied relicensure) to file an appeal request, I must deny this request.\" \r\n  Joubert's attorney, responded to Richardson and the hearing examiner with another \r\n  letter to Griswold stating that he had advised Joubert to \"seek legal redress \r\n  in another appropriate forum.\" \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 1994, a DSS Child Protective Services \r\n  Committee issued a final administrative decision upholding both the \"indicated\" \r\n  report of abuse and Joubert's inclusion on the Central Registry for neglect \r\n  and lack of supervision of Edwina on February 16. The decision made no mention \r\n  of the relicensing issue. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-655(F) &amp; \r\n  (G) (Supp. 1999), on January 17, 1995, Joubert petitioned the family court for \r\n  judicial review of the administrative decision and the denial of The Pines' \r\n  relicensing application. On September 22, 1995, the family court reversed all \r\n  prior DSS decisions and ordered the agency to expunge Joubert's name and all \r\n  identifying information from the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect. \r\n  DSS did not appeal the court's decision, but responded with a letter, dated \r\n  October 12, 1995, stating it had removed Joubert's name and identifying information \r\n  from the Central Registry and was endeavoring to comply with the family court's \r\n  order regarding reinstatement of The Pines' license to operate.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 14, 1997, Joubert and The Pines filed \r\n  separate tort actions against DSS alleging gross negligence and intentional \r\n  failure to renew The Pines' operational license or afford a \"fair hearing\" on \r\n  the matter. Joubert's complaint also asserted a claim for damages arising from \r\n  the period of time his name appeared on the Central Registry of Child Abuse \r\n  and Neglect. DSS filed identical motions for summary judgment on February 11, \r\n  1998. On January 20, 1999, the circuit court held a hearing on the motions. \r\n  By orders dated February 10, 1999, the court granted summary judgment on both \r\n  motions based upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) render inapplicable \r\n  the statute of limitations found in Â§ 15-78-110?\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Did the trial court err in granting summary \r\n  judgment because the action was brought within two years of the Family Court's \r\n  order?\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

In determining whether any triable issue\r\n\r\nof fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom must be\r\n\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

Application of Â§ 15-78-70(b)\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoubert and The Pines argue the trial court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment to DSS because S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. \r\n  1999) renders the statutory limitations period set by the Tort Claims Act inapplicable. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis contention, neither raised to nor ruled upon \r\n  by the trial court, is not preserved for our review. See Wilder Corp. v. \r\n  Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998)(\"It is axiomatic that \r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\"); \r\n  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Dep't, 328 S.C. \r\n  24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997) (an issue not raised to the trial court is not properly \r\n  before the appellate court); Pike v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., \r\n  332 S.C. 605, 506 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1998) (to preserve an issue for appeal \r\n  a party must raise it to the trial court and obtain a ruling). \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if preserved, however, the argument lacks \r\n  merit. Section 15-78-70(b) states: \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing in this chapter may be construed to give \r\n  an employee of a governmental entity immunity from suit and liability if it \r\n  is proved that the employee's conduct was not within the scope of his official \r\n  duties or that it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or \r\n  a crime involving moral turpitude. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) (Supp. 1999). By its \r\n  own terms, the subsection applies only to employees of a government \r\n  agency. Because neither action in the case at bar names any individual defendants, \r\n  Â§ 15-78-70(b) simply cannot apply. Furthermore, this statutory provision lifts \r\n  the immunity normally enjoyed by governmental employees if they act outside \r\n  the scope of their employment or their actions constitute fraud, malice, an \r\n  intent to harm, or a crime of moral turpitude. Absolutely nothing in subsection \r\n  (b) references a limitations period and, as part of the general Tort Claims \r\n  Act statutory scheme, it is subject to the Act's statute of limitations as prescribed \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. 1999) (\"Except as provided for in Section \r\n  15-3-40, any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless \r\n  an action is commenced within [the applicable limitations period]\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Application of Â§ 15-78-110\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoubert and The Pines assert, even if S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 applies, summary judgment was inappropriate because 1) they \r\n  filed a verified claim, which operated to extend the statutory limitations period \r\n  to three years, and 2)the limitations period did not begin to run until September \r\n  20, 1995, when the family court filed its order reversing the DSS Child Protective \r\n  Services Committee. We disagree. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout question, DSS is a \"governmental entity\" \r\n  as defined by the Tort Claims Act in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(d) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  The Act, which governs all tort claims against governmental entities, see, \r\n  e.g., Pollard v. County of Florence, 314 S.C. 397, 444 S.E.2d 534 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994); Searcy v. Dep't of Educ. Transp. Div., 303 S.C. 544, 402 \r\n  S.E.2d 486 (Ct.App.1991), provides a strict statute of limitations period: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept as provided for in Section 15-3-40, \r\n  (1) any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred \r\n  unless an action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or \r\n  should have been discovered; provided, that if the claimant first filed a claim \r\n  pursuant to this chapter then the action for damages based upon the same occurrence \r\n  is forever barred unless the action is commenced within three years of the date \r\n  the loss was or should have been discovered.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  15-78-110 (Supp. 1999). The Tort Claims Act contains a general two-year statute \r\n  of limitations; however, if a plaintiff files a statutorily-defined claim within \r\n  one year of the loss or injury, the statute of limitations is extended to three \r\n  years. See id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-80 (Supp. 1999); see \r\n  also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(a) (Supp. 1999) (\"Except as provided for \r\n  in Section 15-3-40, an action for damages under this chapter may be instituted \r\n  at any time within two years after the loss was or should have been discovered. \r\n  Provided, that if a claim for damages was filed and disallowed or rejected an \r\n  action for damages filed under this chapter, based upon the same occurrence \r\n  as the claim, may be instituted within three years after the loss was or should \r\n  have been discovered.\").\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. \r\n  Verified Claim\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoubert and The Pines maintain, pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110, they had three years from March 24, 1994, in which to \r\n  file the underlying complaints because they submitted a \"verified claim\" on \r\n  January 17, 1995. We disagree.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to assert damages against a \r\n  state agency under our Tort Claims Act: 1) the filing of a \"verified claim\" \r\n  pursuant to Â§ 15-78-80(a); or 2) the institution of an action against the appropriate \r\n  agency as happened here. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-80(a) &amp; 15-78-90(b) \r\n  (Supp. 1999). The Act defines a claim as \"any written demand against the State \r\n  of South Carolina or a political subdivision for money only, on account of loss, \r\n  caused by the tort of any employee of the State or a political subdivision while \r\n  acting within the scope of his official duty.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(b) \r\n  (Supp. 1999).\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Court of Appeals noted in Searcy, \r\n  Â§ 15-78-80 expressly requires the person to file a verified claim in order to \r\n  benefit from the three-year limitations period:\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA twofold purpose is served by a requirement of \r\n  this kind. First, the governmental entity is put on notice so that it can both \r\n  conduct an investigation while the facts are fresh and preserve the evidence. \r\n  Cochran v. City of Sumter, 242 S.C. 382, 131 S.E.2d 153 (1963), overruled \r\n  on other grounds, McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985). \r\n  Second, a verification serves to discourage the filing of false claims because \r\n  a verification permits a prosecution for perjury if the claim is fraudulent.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSearcy, 303 S.C. at 546, 402 S.E.2d at \r\n  487.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollard v. County of Florence, 314 S.C. \r\n  397, 400, 444 S.E.2d 534, 536 (Ct. App. 1994). In particular, the verified claim \r\n  procedure outlined in the statute adds a year on to the regular limitations \r\n  period to encourage claimants to file with the offending agency before bringing \r\n  a lawsuit. Id. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to trigger the three-year statute of limitations \r\n  under Â§ 15-78-110, a party must follow the procedure outlined in S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-80:\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) A verified claim for damages under this chapter, \r\n  setting forth the circumstances which brought about the loss, the extent of \r\n  the loss, the time and place the loss occurred, the names of all persons involved \r\n  if known, and the amount of the loss sustained may be filed:\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (1) in cases against the State, with the State \r\n  Budget and Control Board, or with the agency employing an employee whose alleged \r\n  act or omission gave rise to the claim;|\r\n  . . . .\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) Each agency and political subdivision must \r\n  designate an employee or office to accept the filing of the claims.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) Filing may be accomplished by receipt of certified \r\n  mailing of the claims or by compliance with the provisions of law relating to \r\n  service of process.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) The verified claim may be received by the Budget \r\n  and Control Board or the appropriate agency or political subdivision. If filed, \r\n  the claim must be received within one year after the loss was or should have \r\n  been discovered.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) In all cases in which a claim is filed, the \r\n  Budget and Control Board or political subdivision has one hundred eighty days \r\n  from the date of filing of the claim in which to determine whether the claim \r\n  should be allowed or disallowed. Failure to notify the claimant of action upon \r\n  the claim within one hundred eighty days from the date of filing of the claim \r\n  is considered a disallowance of the claim.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) The handling and disposition of claims filed \r\n  under this chapter are not subject to the provisions of Article 3, Chapter 23 \r\n  of Title 1.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(g) In all cases, where insurance is provided by \r\n  the Budget and Control Board, the agency or political subdivision involved must \r\n  cooperate with the Budget and Control Board in the investigation and handling \r\n  of any claim. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-80 (Supp. 1999); see \r\n  Searcy, 303 S.C. at 547, 402 S.E.2d at 488 (the \"claim\" mentioned throughout \r\n  the Tort Claims Act can only refer to the \"verified claim\" described in Â§ 15-78-80).\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoubert and The Pines aver these statutory requirements were met by: 1) Joubert's testimony before the DSS appeals\r\n\r\nexaminer; 2) the oral \"reservation of rights\" made by their attorney at the hearing; 3) their answers to interrogatories from\r\n\r\nDSS; 4) Joubert's deposition testimony; and 5) the filing of the petition for review in the family court.  None of the above\r\n\r\nactions by the plaintiffs constitute a claim as defined by the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oral testimony and \"reservation of rights\" \r\n  are not verified claims brought under the Tort Claims Act. They are also not \r\n  written claims which are capable of being filed with the appropriate agencies. \r\n  In the \"reservation of rights,\" counsel for Joubert and The Pines stated:\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe object to the revocation of the license, and \r\n  we object to the refusal of this agency to renew the license as of April 1, \r\n  1994. As such, we reserve our rights specifically to pursue this matter in another \r\n  court, in another jurisdiction at another time, as well as our rights to proceed \r\n  against the individuals involved in the decision making process of this institution. \r\n  With that, we're here for the protection of our rights pursuant to this subpoena, \r\n  which has been issued.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reservation makes no statement regarding \"the \r\n  extent of the loss, the time and place the loss occurred, the names of all persons \r\n  involved if known, and the amount of the loss sustained\" as required by S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-80. It therefore fails to qualify as a verified claim. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interrogatory answers and family court petition are not demands for money damages.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-30(b) &amp; 15-78-80 (Supp. 1999); Vines v. Self Mem'l Hosp., 314 S.C. 305, 443 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1994) (the verified claim\r\n\r\nmust set forth the extent and amount of the loss sustained); Rink v. Richland Mem'l Hosp., 310 S.C. 193, 422 S.E.2d 747\r\n\r\n(1992) (plaintiff's letter to hospital did not comply with statutory requirements, including the amount of the loss sustained). \r\n\r\nThey do not satisfy the requirement of being a claim brought under the Tort Claims Act.  The petition to family court was an\r\n\r\nappeal brought under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-655(F) &amp; (G) (Supp. 1999), and not a claim brought under Chapter 78 of Title\r\n\r\n15 as necessary to be a verified claim under Â§15-78-80.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal in family court did not involve the \r\n  claims by The Pines arising from DSS denying the license renewal. There is a \r\n  required bifurcation of the claim by Joubert to have his name removed from the \r\n  registry and the claims by The Pines for the denial of their license renewal. \r\n  The Pines' claim is brought under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-2660 and 1-23-380, \r\n  which require the appeal to be before the Administrative Law Judge Division \r\n  and not the family court. Therefore, the claims by The Pines could not be protected \r\n  from the statute of limitations by the filing of a claim in family court.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost importantly, our courts have repeatedly held \r\n  strict compliance with the verified claim statute is mandatory. See, e.g., \r\n  Vines, 314 S.C. at 307, 443 S.E.2d at 910 (\"A claim against a state entity \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act must be verified to entitle a plaintiff to the three-year \r\n  statute of limitations. Substantial compliance is not sufficient.\"); Rink, \r\n  310 S.C. 196-197, 422 S.E.2d at 748-749 (\"[W]hen a plaintiff seeks to sue a \r\n  political subdivision he 'must fully comply with the prescribed terms and conditions \r\n  of the statute, and the filing of a claim as required is an essential prerequisite \r\n  to a right of action.\") (quoting Cochran v. City of Sumter, 242 S.C. \r\n  382, 386, 131 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1963), overruled on other grounds by \r\n  McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985)); Pollard, \r\n  314 S.C. at 400, 444 S.E.2d at 536 (substantial compliance with the statute \r\n  is not enough; the \"verified claim\" procedure must be strictly complied with \r\n  in order to trigger the three-year limitations period). Accordingly, because \r\n  Joubert and The Pines did not comply fully with the statutory mandate, no verified \r\n  claim was filed, and the statute of limitations on the underlying actions was \r\n  two years, not three.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. \r\n  Date the Cause of Action Arose\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed the underlying complaints in this \r\n  case were filed on February 14, 1997. Therefore, pursuant to Â§ 15-78-110, the \r\n  \"loss\" to Joubert and The Pines must have occurred or been discovered no earlier \r\n  than February 14, 1995. See id.; Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999); Tanyel v. Osborne, 312 \r\n  S.C. 473, 441 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App. 1994). The trial court found Joubert's loss \r\n  was sustained, if at all, on March 24, 1994 when the children were removed from \r\n  The Pines, on May 18, 1994 when his name was entered on the DSS Central Registry \r\n  for Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, or, at the latest, on June 21, 1994 when he received \r\n  the letter from DSS informing him that his operation license would not be renewed. \r\n  As to The Pines, the trial court found that any loss would have occurred on \r\n  March 24 when the facility was closed or on June 21 when Joubert received the \r\n  non-renewal letter. According to the trial court then, June 21, 1994 is the \r\n  latest date either plaintiff could reasonably claim as the date of loss.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs, on the other hand, assert their loss \r\n  occurred on September 20, 1995, when the family court reversed the DSS administrative \r\n  decision. They contend since there was no final ruling until that date, the \r\n  statute of limitations could not have begun to run. Under the Tort Claims Act, \r\n  however, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff should \r\n  know that he might have a potential claim against another, not when he develops \r\n  a full-blown theory of recovery.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery rule is applicable to actions brought \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act. Barr v. City of Rock Hill, 330 S.C. 640, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 157 (Ct.App.1998). In Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 645 (1996), the Supreme Court explicated:\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the discovery rule, the statute of \r\n  limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been \r\n  discovered. The statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or \r\n  should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action \r\n  arises from the wrongful conduct. We have interpreted the \"exercise of reasonable \r\n  diligence\" to mean that the injured party must act with some promptness where \r\n  the facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common \r\n  knowledge and experience on notice that a claim against another party might \r\n  exist. Moreover, the fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full \r\n  extent of the damage is immaterial.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDean, 321 S.C. at 364, 468 S.E.2d at 647 \r\n  (citations omitted).

If \r\n  the contention is that DSS was on notice of a claim for damages since March \r\n  24, 1994, then surely Joubert was aware of the possible cause of action. Indeed, \r\n  Joubert's attorney, in a letter to the DSS director dated November 22, 1994, \r\n  stated that he had advised Joubert to \"seek legal redress in another appropriate \r\n  forum.\" Even if we considered this date as the time Joubert was obviously aware \r\n  of his loss, it would have been necessary to file the instant actions by November \r\n  22, 1996. See Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 414 S.E.2d 115 \r\n  (1992) (section 15-78-110 of Tort Claims Act is triggered by the date a cause \r\n  of action accrues); Searcy v.

Under these circumstances \r\n  we find a reasonable person would have been on notice that a claim against DSS \r\n  existed as early as March 24, 1994, but no later than November 22, 1994. Even \r\n  accepting the latest date, the case sub judice was filed after the \r\n  appropriate two-year statute of limitations had run.\r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  Due Process \r\n  and Claim for Failure to Comply\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the issues on appeal concerning an alleged \r\n  due process violation and additional claims for damages not barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations are not preserved. See Solomon v. City Realty Co., 262 \r\n  S.C. 198, 203 S.E.2d 435 (1974) (conclusory arguments are deemed abandoned); \r\n  Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 439 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993) (an issue is deemed abandoned and thus not presented for appellate \r\n  review if argued in a short, conclusory statement without supporting authority).\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rule S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b) is efficacious \r\n  only to employees of a government agency and is inapposite to an action filed \r\n  against a governmental entity under the Tort Claims Act. We hold Joubert and \r\n  The Pines did not file a verified claim entitling them to the three-year statute \r\n  of limitations. Accordingly, each had only two years from the date of loss to \r\n  bring the instant actions. Because the losses should have been discovered, at \r\n  the latest, by November of 1994, and these suits were not commenced until 1997, \r\n  we find the two-year statute of limitations operated as a complete bar. Therefore, \r\n  as no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding when the causes of action \r\n  accrued and when they were filed, the trial court did not err in granting summary \r\n  judgment to DSS.\r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and \r\n  SHULER, J., concur. \r\n1.\r\n   This section authorizes an exception to the statute of limitations if the person entitled to bring the action is under legal disability at the time the\r\n\r\ncause of action accrued.

The tax sale was later set aside and H &amp; K brought this action against \r\n  the taxpayers and several Beaufort County defendants(1) \r\n  to recover the purchase price plus interest. The Beaufort County Master-in-Equity \r\n  granted the Beaufort County Respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings, \r\n  holding H &amp; K could recover only against the taxpayers. H &amp; K appeals. \r\n  We reverse and remand. \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWilliam D. and Lavada A. Brannen \r\n  failed to pay their 1991 taxes on property they owned in Beaufort County. H \r\n  &amp; K subsequently bought the property at a tax sale on October 5, 1992. After \r\n  the Brannens failed to redeem the property within the statutory redemption period, \r\n  title passed to H &amp; K. In 1995, the Brannens brought an action to set aside \r\n  the tax sale. The Beaufort County Master-in-Equity set the tax sale aside, holding \r\n  the county treasurer failed to provide proper notice to the Brannens. The Brannens \r\n  were issued a new deed, but H &amp; K did not receive a refund of their purchase \r\n  price or any interest. When H &amp; K demanded $4,000 plus statutory interest \r\n  from the county treasurer, the treasurer informed H &amp; K that the Brannens \r\n  received the $4,000, less the taxes and penalties due. H &amp; K then brought \r\n  this action. \r\n   \r\nThe master granted the Beaufort County \r\n  Respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings on two grounds. First, the \r\n  court concluded that because the Brannens were in possession of the property \r\n  and because they received the money H &amp; K paid for the property, they, rather \r\n  than the Beaufort County Respondents, owed H &amp; K the money. Second, the \r\n  court held the Beaufort County Respondents were immune from liability pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code Section 15-78-60(11), which provides in pertinent part \r\n  that governmental entities are \"not liable for a loss resulting from . . . assessment \r\n  or collection of taxes or special assessments or enforcement of tax laws . . \r\n  . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(11) (Supp. 1999). H &amp; K appeals. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nH &amp; K first argues the Beaufort \r\n  County Respondents should not be entitled to immunity under South Carolina Code \r\n  Section 15-78-60(11) (Supp. 1999). We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn order for the Beaufort County \r\n  Respondents to be immune under Section 15-78-60(11), H &amp; K's loss would \r\n  have to be the result of the county's \"assessment or collection of taxes or \r\n  . . . enforcement of tax laws.\" Â§ 15-78-60(11). In this case, H &amp; K's loss \r\n  is a direct result of the Beaufort County Respondents' failure to refund H &amp; \r\n  K the purchase price when a tax sale was set aside, a ministerial act separate \r\n  and distinct from assessing, collecting or enforcing tax laws against a taxpayer. \r\n  Morever, the discernible purpose behind the immunity provision contained in \r\n  subsection (11) is to afford a governing entity protection from suit by persons \r\n  like the Brannens who lose property because of a faulty tax sale, not to shield \r\n  the entity from liability for refunding money to the wrong party. Therefore, \r\n  we hold that section 15-78-60(11) is inapplicable here. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nH &amp; K next asserts that South \r\n  Carolina Code Section 12-51-100 requires the Beaufort County Respondents to \r\n  refund H &amp; K the money it paid for the property plus eight percent interest, \r\n  and therefore, judgment on the pleadings was improper. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Section \r\n  12-15-100 (Supp. 1997) provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUpon the real estate being redeemed, \r\n  the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall \r\n  cancel the sale in the tax sale book and note thereon the amount paid, by whom \r\n  and when. The successful purchaser, at the delinquent tax sale, shall promptly \r\n  be notified by mail to return the tax sale receipt to the person officially \r\n  charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in order to be expeditiously \r\n  refunded the purchase price plus the eight percent interest provided in Â§ 12-51-90.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBeaufort County Respondents argue \r\n  that the situation presented here does not constitute a redemption because the \r\n  statutory redemption period had expired. We view the return of the property \r\n  to the Brannens as the ultimate redemption and hold that section 12-51-100 applies. \r\n  It is inconceivable to this court that the General Assembly would require the \r\n  taxing entity to \"expeditiously refund[ ] the purchase price\" to the tax sale \r\n  purchaser when the property is redeemed during the redemption period, but not \r\n  require the entity to do so when a tax sale is set aside. In our view, this \r\n  would constitute an absurd result and one that could not have been intended \r\n  by the General Assembly.(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Beaufort County Respondents cite \r\n  Red Oak Lands, Inc. v. Lane, 268 S.C. 631, 235 S.E.2d 718 (1977), for \r\n  the proposition that absent a statute to the contrary, the doctrine of caveat \r\n  emptor applies to tax sales and the purchaser cannot recover from a taxing authority \r\n  in the event the tax sale is set aside. However, as noted above, we find section \r\n  12-51-100 is broad enough to cover the present factual situation and afford \r\n  H &amp; K a statutory remedy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, we are mindful of the fact \r\n  that the master based his decision, in part, on the fact that the Brannens received \r\n  both the property and the money and thus H &amp; K's sole remedy was against \r\n  the Brannens. However, it was the Beaufort County Respondents which created \r\n  this inequitable situation by failing to provide the Brannens with the proper \r\n  notice that resulted in the tax sale being set aside and erred in refunding \r\n  the purchase price, less the tax delinquency, to the Brannens rather than to \r\n  H &amp; K. Therefore, we do not believe H &amp; K is limited to pursuing a legal \r\n  remedy solely against he Brannens.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the order \r\n  on appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n1.  \r\nSpecifically, H &amp; K named \r\nthe Beaufort County treasurer, the Beaufort County tax collector, and the county \r\nitself as defendants.  \r\n2. \r\n In a 1998 amendment, effective \r\nJuly 6, 1998, the General Assembly amended section 12-51-100 and substituted \"interest \r\nprovided in Section 12-51-90\" for \"eight percent interest provided in Â§ 12-51-90.\" \r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-100 (Supp. 1999).  \r\n3.  \r\n  At oral argument, counsel for the Beaufort County Respondents argued that the \r\n  county acted appropriately in refunding the overage, the purchase price less \r\n  the delinquent tax amount, according to statutory direction. Although counsel \r\n  could not cite the pertinent statute, we presume he based his argument on South \r\n  Carolina Code Section 12-51-130 (Supp. 1999). Section 12-51-130 applies when \r\n  the defaulting taxpayer fails to redeem the realty and the tax sale purchaser \r\n  has received tax title. In the present case, however, the tax sale was set aside, \r\n  which is tantamount to a redemption, and the defaulting taxpayer, not the purchaser, \r\n  received title to the realty. Furthermore, the Beaufort County Respondents did \r\n  not refund the overage to the Brannens when the redemption period lapsed, as \r\n  required under the statute, but waited until after the tax sale was set aside. \r\n  Therefore, we find section 12-51-130 inapplicable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3183","title":"Norton v.

We affirm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile working as a carman(2)\r\nfor Norfolk, Lester Norton fell when his foot became caught in a welding box,\r\ninjuring his left knee. Coworker James Wilson, who witnessed Norton's fall in\r\nthe tool shed, testified the box was empty and should have been placed in the\r\ntrash instead of wedged under a shelf ledge. Wilson further stated the box was\r\nnot visible until Norton's foot became caught in it, although the shed has\r\nsufficient lighting. In the days after the fall, Norton did not complain of pain\r\nand continued to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately two weeks after the fall, Norton was going\r\ndown the stairs at his home when he suddenly experienced severe pain in the same\r\nknee. Norton consulted a doctor who aspirated the knee and injected it with\r\ncortisone. This procedure was repeated a short time later but Norton's knee\r\nremained swollen. Norton subsequently had arthroscopic surgery on his knee. Dr.\r\nJames McCarthy testified Norton had a torn meniscus and early chondromalacia\r\nresulting from his fall on the job. According to McCarthy, Norton is no longer\r\nable to perform his duties as a carman due to his knee problems. McCarthy\r\nfurther stated Norton's condition is not only permanent but will get\r\nprogressively worse. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial testimony indicated the Norfolk company handbook\r\nprovides employees must keep the premises under their control neat and clean.\r\nAdditionally, the railroad had placed various signs around the coach shop which\r\nstate &quot;Downtime is clean-up time.&quot; Although the shed is left unlocked\r\nduring the day, only carmen have access to it. Tom Reid, a Norfolk supervisor,\r\ntestified if he had seen the box under the shelf, he would not have required\r\nanyone to pick it up because empty boxes were frequently used for transporting\r\ntools from the shed to the jobsite. He stated empty boxes were stored in the\r\nshed for that purpose. Norton himself corroborated the use of empty boxes for\r\ncarrying nuts and bolts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury found Norfolk was not negligent. Norton moved for\r\na new trial &quot;according to the doctrine of the thirteenth juror&quot;\r\nacknowledging there was evidence indicating boxes were typically stored in the\r\nshed but arguing the jury &quot;ignored the evidence presented on behalf of the\r\nplaintiff and the court's instruction on the issue of negligence.&quot; Norton\r\nfurther contended the &quot;verdict returned is contrary to the preponderance of\r\nthe evidence presented at trial and is not supported by the factual testimony\r\nelicited by the parties at trial.&quot; The trial judge agreed and granted\r\nNorton's motion for a new trial. Norfolk appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorfolk argues the trial judge incorrectly applied the\r\nSouth Carolina &quot;thirteenth juror&quot; standard in granting the motion for\r\na new trial as opposed to the federal rules governing the grant of a new trial,\r\nand, regardless which standard is applied, the trial judge erred in granting the\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FELA action brought in state court is controlled by\r\nfederal substantive law and state procedural law.\r\n\r\nSee Jennings v. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co., 993 S.W.2d 66, 70\r\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 1999); Pryor v. National R.R.\r\n\r\nPassenger Corp., 703 N.E.2d 997, 1000 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998); Hassell v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Co.,\r\n880 S.W.2d 39, 44 (Tex. App. 1994). However, a form of local practice may not\r\ndefeat a federal right. Brown v.\r\n\r\nWestern Ry. of Ala., 338 U.S. 294, 296, 70 S.Ct. 105, 106 (1949). This is\r\nespecially true when a state procedural rule infringes upon the 7th Amendment\r\nright to a jury trial.  See Dice v. Akron, Canton &amp;\r\n\r\nYoungstown R.R. Co., 342 U.S. 359, 363, 72 S.Ct. 312, 315 (1952).(3) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA motion for a new trial is a procedural rule. Rule 59(a),\r\nSCRCP, provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrounds. A new trial may be granted to\r\nall or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues (1) in an action in\r\nwhich there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new\r\ntrials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the\r\nState; . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has endorsed the continuing viability of the \"thirteenth juror\" doctrine in this state\r\n\r\non several occasions.

In Folkens, the court\r\n\r\nexplained the thirteenth juror doctrine is a \"vehicle by which the trial court may grant a new trial\r\n\r\nabsolute when [the court] finds that the evidence does not justify the verdict. This ruling has also been\r\n\r\ntermed granting a new trial upon the facts.\" Id. (citing S.C. Highway Dept. v. Townsend, 265 S.C. 253,\r\n\r\n217 S.E.2d 778 (1975)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, because the motion in this case forced the trial judge to weigh the evidence, the question is\r\n\r\none governed by federal law.(4)  \"It is firmly established that questions of sufficiency of evidence for\r\n\r\nthe jury in cases arising under [FELA] in state courts are to be determined by federal rules.\"  C.C.\r\n\r\nMarvel, Annotation, Applicability of State Practice and Procedure in Federal Employer's Liability Act\r\n\r\nActions Brought in State Courts, 79 A.L.R.2d 553 (1961).  Thus, there is no question that South Carolina's\r\n\r\n\"thirteenth juror\" doctrine would not be applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout question, Norton requested a new trial pursuant to the \"thirteenth juror\" doctrine.  However,\r\n\r\nthe trial judge's order granting a new trial does not mention that doctrine.   Specifically, the order\r\n\r\nstates: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finds as a matter of fact that the verdict returned herein is contrary to the fair\r\n\r\npreponderance of the evidence presented at trial and is not supported by the factual testimony at\r\n\r\ntrial.  The verdict indicates the jury failed to properly consider and follow the instructions of the court in\r\n\r\nits deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the order does not indicate whether the trial judge invoked the thirteenth juror doctrine or\r\n\r\nthe applicable federal standard for a new trial, we note that Norfolk argued the applicability of the\r\n\r\nfederal standard in its memorandum in opposition to Norton's motion for a new trial and Norton\r\n\r\nadmitted the issue was controlled by federal law in his memorandum.  Thus, since the trial judge did\r\n\r\nnot mention the thirteenth juror doctrine in his order, we may fairly assume that he relied on the\r\n\r\napplicable federal standard in granting a new trial.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the trial judge did rely on the thirteenth juror doctrine in granting a new trial, reversal\r\n\r\nis not warranted.  Because we are permitted to affirm on any ground appearing in the record and\r\n\r\nbecause we fail to discern any significant difference between the analysis employed by a trial judge\r\n\r\nunder the thirteenth juror doctrine and under the applicable federal doctrine, as discussed infra, we\r\n\r\ndecline to reverse the trial judge on the ground that he employed the wrong standard in granting\r\n\r\nNorton a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder federal law, the test to be applied in determining whether to grant a new trial is whether the\r\n\r\nverdict is against the weight of the evidence, that the damages are excessive, or that the trial was for\r\n\r\nother reasons unfair to the moving party.  Walden v. Illinois Cent. Gulf R.R., 975 F.2d 361, 365 (7th Cir.\r\n\r\n1992) (quotations and citations omitted).  \"A trial judge can grant a motion for a new trial if he\r\n\r\nbelieves the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence.\"  Robin v. Wilson Bros. Drilling, 719 F.2d\r\n\r\n96, 98 (5th Cir. 1983).  In fact, the trial judge has discretion to order a new trial when he or she believes\r\n\r\nthe verdict to be against the clear weight of the evidence, even if the verdict is supported by\r\n\r\nsubstantial evidence.  Gill v. Rollins Protective Servs. Co., 836 F.2d 194, 197-98 (4th Cir. 1987). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, we do not find the federal standard substantively different from our state \"thirteenth juror\"\r\n\r\nstandard as far as the trial judge's discretion whether to grant a new trial is concerned.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nboth the federal appellate courts and our appellate courts apply highly deferential standards of\r\n\r\nreview on appeals from such decisions.  It is here, however, on appellate review, that the federal law\r\n\r\nand our state law diverge somewhat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the appellate court reviews the grant or denial of a new trial motion for an abuse of\r\n\r\ndiscretion and will not reverse the trial court's decision unless it is controlled by an error of law or is not\r\n\r\nsupported by the evidence.  Duncan v. Hampton County Sch. Dist. No. 2, 335 S.C. 535, 547, 517 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n449, 455 (Ct. App. 1999).  Our supreme court has also noted that when reviewing the grant or denial of\r\n\r\na new trial, the appellate court will not weigh the conflicting evidence, but if there were no conflicts\r\n\r\nin the evidence, then the court could reverse an order granting a new trial as an error of law\r\n\r\namounting to an abuse of discretion.  South Carolina State Highway Dep't v. Clarkson, 267 S.C. 121,\r\n\r\n127, 226 S.E.2d 696, 697-98 (1976).  Thus, when there is a conflict in the evidence, the trial judge's\r\n\r\ndecision is sacrosanct.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacially, federal law appears to employ a similar standard.  In federal court, the trial judge \"is free to\r\n\r\nweigh the evidence in considering th[e] motion,\" and \"appellate review of the trial court's action is\r\n\r\nlimited to consideration of whether the lower court abused its broad discretion.\"  Gill, 836 F.2d at 197-98; see also Walden, 975 F.2d at 365 (noting that grant or denial of a new trial motion is not subject to\r\n\r\nreview by appellate court except upon exceptional circumstances showing a clear abuse of\r\n\r\ndiscretion).  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals described appellate review of the trial judge's\r\n\r\ndecision as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a new trial rests with the sound discretion of the district court, and we\r\n\r\nreview this decision for a clear abuse of discretion.  Absent a clear abuse of discretion, we shall not\r\n\r\ndisturb this decision; indeed, we have opined that this decision \"' is not reviewable upon appeal, save\r\n\r\nin the most exceptional circumstances, . . .' \".  We commit this discretion to the district court \"because\r\n\r\nthe district judge is in a position to see and hear the witnesses and is able to view the case from a\r\n\r\nperspective that an appellate court can never match.\"  Given the district court's intimate familiarity\r\n\r\nwith the trial, the district court \"may weigh the evidence and assess credibility in ruling on a motion for\r\n\r\na new trial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBristol Steel &amp; Iron Works, Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 41 F.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir. 1994) (internal\r\n\r\ncitations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the broad language used by the foregoing federal authority, most federal courts do not\r\n\r\napply this same discretionary review evenly to grants and denials of new trial motions.  It appears to\r\n\r\nbe generally accepted that federal appeals courts grant less deference to the trial judge when a\r\n\r\nnew trial has been ordered than when one has been denied.  See Brady v. Fort Bend County, 145 F.3d\r\n\r\n691, 713 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1105, 119 S.Ct. 873, 142 L.Ed.2d 774 (1999); Wilburn v.\r\n\r\nMaritrans GP Inc., 139 F.3d 350, 363 (3d Cir. 1998); Hutchinson v. Stuckey, 952 F.2d 1418, 1420-21 (D.C.\r\n\r\nCir. 1992).  The rationale behind this double standard is that when the trial judge grants the motion for\r\n\r\na new trial \"the jury verdict is set aside\" and the \"usual deference to the trial judge conflicts with the\r\n\r\ndeference to the jury on questions of fact.\"  Rixey v. West Paces Ferry Hosp., Inc., 916 F.2d 608, 612\r\n\r\n(11th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted).  In such a case, the trial judge should have found the verdict to be\r\n\r\n\"against the great - not merely the greater - weight of the evidence.\"  Id. at 611.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\ndifference federal law makes in the instant case is not in the discretion used by the trial judge, but in\r\n\r\nthe view this court must take of the trial judge's use of that discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven under the federal standard, it is clear that the trial judge in the instant case could have granted\r\n\r\nNorton a new trial, as he did, upon finding the jury's verdict was contrary to the great weight of the\r\n\r\nevidence.  We find the language employed by the trial judge in his order broad enough to withstand\r\n\r\nthe applicable federal standard of review.(5)   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious courts addressing the issue of negligence under FELA have held a \"relaxed standard of proof\"\r\n\r\napplies under the Act requiring only that plaintiffs demonstrate a railroad's negligence played  a part,\r\n\r\neven the slightest part in producing injury or death.  Hall v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 829 F.Supp. 1571, 1577-78\r\n\r\n(N.D. Ga. 1993); Nelsen v. Research Corp. of Univ. of Haw., 805 F.Supp. 837, 848 (D. Haw. 1992);\r\n\r\nKnowles v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., 856 P.2d 1352, 1355 (Kan. App. 1993); Mitchell v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas\r\n\r\nR.R. Co., 786 S.W.2d 659, 660-61 (Tex. 1990).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ulfik v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 77 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 1996), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals\r\n\r\nnoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has not expressly held that a relaxed standard for negligence, as distinguished\r\n\r\nfrom causation, applies under FELA. Yet numerous appellate courts, including ours, have construed\r\n\r\nthe statute, in light of its broad remedial nature, as creating a relaxed standard for negligence as well\r\n\r\nas causation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the issue of negligence is still governed by the common law requirement of foreseeability in\r\n\r\norder to determine whether or not a defendant is required to guard against a particular risk, the\r\n\r\nconcept of foreseeability has been construed somewhat more liberally in FELA cases than it might\r\n\r\notherwise be under common law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUlfik, at 58 n.1 (citations omitted).  It has indeed been noted that FELA's history has been one of\r\n\r\n\"persistent liberalization\" of the standard of liability under the act.  W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp;\r\n\r\nKeeton on Torts Â§ 80, at 578 (5th ed. 1984).  Additionally:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis [history] has been said to reduce the extent of the negligence required, as well as the quantum of\r\n\r\nproof necessary to establish it, to the \"vanishing point.\"  While it is still undoubtedly true that there must\r\n\r\nbe some shreds of proof both of negligence and of causation, and that \"speculation, conjecture and\r\n\r\npossibilities\" will not be enough, there appears to be little doubt that under [FELA] jury verdicts for the\r\n\r\nplaintiff can be sustained upon evidence which would not be sufficient in the ordinary negligence\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 579 (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the jury returned its verdict on a special verdict form.  The first question was simply\r\n\r\nwhether or not Norfolk was negligent, to which the jury responded in the negative.  In view of the\r\n\r\nrelaxed standard discussed above, we find the lower court's determination there was evidence of\r\n\r\nnegligence on the part of Norfolk and that the jury verdict was contrary to the weight of evidence is\r\n\r\nsupported by the record.  Although there was testimony that boxes like the one Norton stepped in\r\n\r\nwere often used by carmen for carrying parts, additional testimony  indicated that this particular box\r\n\r\nshould not have been where it was, and that empty boxes not properly stored on or under a shelf\r\n\r\nwere generally thrown away.  In fact, after Norton's fall someone threw the box that caused his fall in\r\n\r\nthe trash.  Moreover, storing boxes under shelves on the floor, as was apparently done at times in the\r\n\r\nshop, could certainly foreseeably lead to the type of accident which occurred here.  The unrebutted\r\n\r\ntestimony at trial was that the box at issue was not properly stored on or under the shelves.  Because\r\n\r\nof the special verdict form, the jury's determination in this case ceased upon a finding of no\r\n\r\nnegligence.  Although the next question on the form dealt with proximate cause, the trial judge did\r\n\r\nnot have the clerk read the answer, if there was one, into the record.  Apparently agreeing the inquiry\r\n\r\nended upon the jury's negligence determination, neither party objected or asked that the rest of the\r\n\r\nform be entered into the record.  Thus, Norton's new trial motion dealt solely with the question of\r\n\r\nnegligence.  The trial judge could have found the evidence clearly established negligence on the\r\n\r\npart of Norfolk.  Therefore, the  trial judge's grant of a new trial did not amount to an abuse of\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the lower court is hereby\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J. and MOREHEAD, A.J., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  45 U.S.C.A.

Gammons, of Greenville, \r\n          for appellant.\r\n        \r\n        Susan B. Covington, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The City of Greenville Board \r\n  of Zoning Adjustments and the City of Greenville appeal the circuit court's \r\n  grant of Millicent Massey's applications for uses permitted upon review. We \r\nreverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMassey owns four contiguous lots on Augusta Street, across \r\n  from the intersection with Grove Road. One of the lots Massey owns is vacant. \r\n  The other three have houses on them. The lots are in an area zoned RM-2, for \r\n  multi-family residential use. The City's zoning ordinance permits the Board \r\n  to authorize professional offices in a RM-2 area after public notice and hearing, \r\n  and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards. This exception is termed \r\n  a \"use permitted upon review\" or \"use on review.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1998, Massey applied for a use on review of \r\n  her property at 1401 Augusta Street. In the application, she stated the proposed \r\n  use was a law office. A public hearing was held on the application on July 23, \r\n  1998. The Board tabled the matter until August 27, 1998. Massey subsequently \r\n  filed an application for a use on review for 1311 Augusta Street, which adjoins \r\n  1401 Augusta Street. She stated the proposed use for the adjoining lot was a \r\n  professional office. The Board considered the two applications at the August \r\n  hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the August hearing, the Board voted to deny \r\n  Massey's applications. On September 2, 1998, Bryan Wood, the zoning administrator, \r\n  sent Massey a letter notifying her of the Board's denial of her applications. \r\n  Massey appealed the Board's decision to the circuit court. In its return to \r\n  the circuit court, the Board included a document entitled \"Findings of Fact \r\n  and Conclusions by the Greenville Board of Zoning Adjustments.\" The document \r\n  was dated October 9, 1998 and signed by the Board's chairperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the trial court allowed Massey, over the \r\n  City's objection, to present the additional testimony of several witnesses who \r\n  had not testified before the Board. In response, the City called its zoning \r\n  administrator as a witness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the circuit court considered the October document, \r\n  it relied on the conclusions set forth in the September 2, 1998 letter, finding \r\n  the October document did not constitute the decision of the Board. The circuit \r\n  court held the Board acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in denying Massey's \r\n  applications. Accordingly, it reversed the Board's denial of the applications. \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA reviewing court should not disturb the findings of a zoning \r\n  board of adjustment unless the board has acted arbitrarily or in an obvious \r\n  abuse of discretion, or unless the board has acted illegally or in excess of \r\n  its lawfully delegated authority. Bannum v. City of Columbia, 335 S.C. \r\n  202, 516 S.E.2d 439 (1999); Hartman v. City of Columbia, 268 S.C. 44, \r\n  232 S.E.2d 15 (1977).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmission of Additional Testimony Before Circuit \r\n  Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City argues the circuit court erred in allowing Massey \r\n  to present testimony on appeal that was not presented at the Board's hearings. \r\n  We agree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transcript of the Board hearing is clearly inadequate \r\n  for review. The transcriber noted many portions of the hearing were inaudible. \r\n  In many places, the transcript does not identify who is speaking, using \"Man\" \r\n  and \"Woman\" to designate the speakers. However, the City argues, \"The correct \r\n  response under Section 6-29-840 is a remand to the Board for a rehearing.\" Instead \r\n  of reversing and remanding, the circuit court allowed Massey to supplement the \r\n  record with additional testimony pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-23-160 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe propriety of the court's allowing additional testimony \r\n  hinges upon whether Title 5 or Title 6 is applicable to this case. Section 5-23-160 \r\n  provides, \"If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the [reviewing] court that \r\n  testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take \r\n  evidence . . . which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the \r\n  determination of the court shall be made.\" In 1994, the General Assembly greatly \r\n  revised the zoning statutes for local governments with the South Carolina Local \r\n  Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act. 1994 Act No. 355, as amended \r\n  by 1999 Act No. 15, effective April 1, 1999. \"Municipal governments could follow \r\n  either set of the former provisions until their repeal . . . and they could \r\n  implement the 1994 Act at any time.\" I'on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  ___ S.C. ___, 526 S.E.2d 716 at n.3 (2000). The replacement statute, section \r\n  6-29-840 (Supp. 1999), states, \"The findings of fact by the board of appeals \r\n  shall be treated in the same manner as a finding of fact by a jury, and the \r\n  court may not take additional evidence.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Massey contends the circuit court properly heard \r\n  additional testimony pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-23-160, Massey elected to \r\n  proceed under Title 6. In Massey's petition on appeal to the circuit court, \r\n  she stated that the applicable standard of review was found in S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§Â§ 6-7-780 &amp; 6-29-840 (Supp. 1999). The City stated in its return that Title \r\n  6 governed the appeal. In Massey's Memorandum in Opposition to the City's Return \r\n  of Appeal, she \"agree[d] . . . that the statute governing this appeal \r\n  and the standard of review to be applied is set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Section \r\n  6-29-840 . . . .\" (emphasis added). In the circuit court's \r\n  order, it found \"the parties agree that this appeal is governed by S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 6-29-840 . . . .\" Because Massey elected to proceed under section 6-29-840, \r\n  the circuit court's consideration of additional testimony under section 5-23-160 \r\n  was error.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if Massey had elected to proceed under \r\n  Title 5, the evidence before the circuit court exceeded the scope allowed by \r\n  the statute. Section 5-23-160 \"does not authorize a trial de novo; rather, it \r\n  gives the reviewing court the authority to supplement the record to make an \r\n  intelligent review of the actions of the board.\" Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 \r\n  S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565,566 (1987).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court allowed Massey to present testimony by \r\n  a licensed real estate broker and real estate appraiser, a police officer, and \r\n  Massey's estate planning attorney. None of these witnesses testified at the \r\n  Board hearings. Although the police officer submitted a written memorandum, \r\n  which was considered by the Board and contained the substance of his testimony \r\n  before the circuit court, the other two witnesses presented evidence which was \r\n  not before the Board when it reached its decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Frank Dietz, the licensed real estate broker \r\n  and appraiser who did not testify at the Board's hearing, is especially troublesome. \r\n  Dietz's testimony included his extensive educational and experiential background. \r\n   He opined that there was no reason to distinguish Massey's property \r\n  from other properties which had been granted uses on review. He also testified \r\n  that neither residential property values nor traffic would be affected if the \r\n  requested use on review was granted. Furthermore, Dietz testified that Massey's \r\n  property would be better used and more desirable as a business than a residence. \r\n   None of this information was presented by anyone with Dietz's \r\n  qualifications at the Board hearings. Dietz's testimony did not provide the \r\n  circuit court with the information necessary for an intelligent review of the \r\n  Board's actions. The testimony offered new information which was not considered \r\n  by the Board, but was used as the basis for reversing the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the circuit court impermissibly supplemented the \r\n  record and the transcript of the Board hearing is insufficient for review, we \r\n  reverse and remand the matter to the Board for rehearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard's Final Order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City also argues the circuit court erred in rejecting \r\n  the October document's \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions.\" As an initial matter, \r\n  we note the \r\n  circuit court did not reject the Findings of Fact and Conclusions. The circuit \r\n  court considered the October document, but held it did not constitute the Board's \r\n  final decision. We agree with the circuit court's determination that the October \r\n  document was not the Board's final decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Board denied Massey's application for a use permitted \r\n  upon review at its August 27, 1998 Board Hearing. Bryan Wood, the zoning administrator, \r\n  mailed Massey a letter explaining the Board's decision. Relying upon this letter, \r\n  Massey filed her notice of appeal on September 25, 1998. After Wood mailed Massey \r\n  the letter, Wood listened to the audio tapes of the hearing and prepared a document \r\n  entitled, \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions.\" This document was signed by the \r\n  Board's chairperson after being reviewed by the chairperson and another Board \r\n  member. The remaining Board members never reviewed the document. The \"Findings \r\n  of Fact and Conclusions\" document is dated October 9, 1998. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to use the \"Findings of Fact and \r\n  Conclusions\" as the Boards's decision because (1) \"there [was] no evidence or \r\n  other indication that the members of the Board who voted against Massey's application \r\n  considered or assented to the October document,\" and (2) the document, \"drafted \r\n  one and a half months after the August hearing, is materially different from \r\n  the decision set forth in the July and August transcripts.\" Instead, it considered \r\n  the letter Wood mailed Massey as the Board's final decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All final decisions . . . of the board [of zoning appeals] \r\n  shall be in writing and be permanently filed in the office of the board as a \r\n  proper record.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-7-740 (Supp. 1999). The final decision must \r\n  contain separately stated \"findings of fact and conclusions of law . . . .\" \r\n  Id. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the conclusions set forth in the letter which was \r\n  mailed to Massey are similar to the conclusions in the October document, the \r\n  letter to Massey did not contain separately stated findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law. Because the letter to Massey did not satisfy the statutory requirements, \r\n  the trial court erred in holding the letter constituted the Board's final decision. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§6-7-740.(2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the letter to Massey did not meet the \r\n  statute's requirement for a final decision, the October \"Findings of Facts and \r\n  Conclusions\" also cannot constitute the Board's final action, having been shown \r\n  to only two of the five Board members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, an administrative agency, board, or \r\n  commission should act as a body, and, in the absence of a statutory exception, \r\n  can act officially only in or at a lawfully convened session, if the act is \r\n  one requiring deliberation or the exercise of discretion or judgment. Except \r\n  where authorized by statute, the powers and duties of an administrative body \r\n  may not be exercised by the individual members separately.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73 C.J.S. Public Administrative Law and Practice \r\n  Â§16 at 384-385 (1983). \"In order to be the action of the board, the action must \r\n  be that of the board as such and not merely the action of the individual members \r\n  thereof . . . .\" 101A C.J.S. Zoning &amp; Land Planning Â§ 189 at 560 \r\n  (1979). See also 73A C.J.S. Public Administrative Law and Practice \r\n  Â§138 at 83 (1983) (\"Where the legislature gives quasi-judicial powers to an \r\n  administrative agency or officer, only the agency or person granted the authority \r\n  may exercise it, and it has been held that a . . . decision by a person not \r\n  authorized, notwithstanding approval by an administrative agency or officer, \r\n  is without legal force and effect.\"); 56 Am. Jur. 2d Â§155 Municipal Corporations \r\n  Â§ 155 (1971) (\"[T]he powers of a municipal council or body must be exercised \r\n  at a meeting which is legally called. Action of all the members of the council \r\n  separately is not the action of the council, and an agreement entered into separately \r\n  by the members of the council outside a regular meeting is not binding.\").\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be fundamentally unfair \r\n  to allow a document promulgated by the Board after Massey appealed to serve \r\n  as the final decision. Because the \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions\" document \r\n  was not the Board's action and was promulgated after Massey filed her notice \r\n  of appeal, the circuit court correctly held the document did not constitute \r\n  the Board's final decision.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only record of the Board's action is the transcript \r\n  of the July and August hearings. The City argues that the vote on the record \r\n  was the Board's final decision. However, the Board's decision recorded in the \r\n  transcript cannot satisfy the legal requirements for a final decision. Section \r\n  6-7-740 requires that the Board's final decision be \"in writing\" with separate \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law. Even if the transcript is considered \r\n  a \"writing,\" it is virtually indecipherable and does not contain separate findings \r\n  of fact and legal conclusions. Therefore, the transcript does not meet the statutory \r\n  requirements of a final decision.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause there has been no final Board decision \r\n  in accordance with section 6-29-840, as is mandated for further judicial review, \r\n  we remand the case to the Board. Written findings of fact and conclusions of \r\n  law should be promulgated and either signed by the Board or ratified on the \r\n  record by the Board before written notice of the Board's decision is given to \r\n  the applicant. Such a procedure will avoid confusion as to when the thirty days \r\n  to file an appeal commence, and provide an adequate record of the Board's action \r\n  for judicial review.\r\n  \r\nReview on Remand\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6-29-840 provides, \"In the event the judge \r\n  determines that the certified record is insufficient for review, the matter \r\n  may be remanded to the zoning board of appeals for rehearing.\" (Emphasis \r\n  added). Because of the lapse of time between this opinion and the Board hearing, \r\n  the continual commercialization of the affected area,(3) \r\n  and the illegibility of the Board hearing transcript, a de novo hearing before \r\n  the Board is necessary on remand.

Inasmuch as Â§ 6-29-840 and Â§ 5-23-160 conflict, Massey cannot elect to proceed in a hybrid fashion under both titles.\r\n\r\n2.

The property at issue in Rushing is located diagonally across the street from Massey's.  In deciding Rushing, over\r\n\r\ntwo decades before Massey's petition, the court stated, \"The area is heavily developed for commercial uses. . . .

Mazzone (the mother) appeals from a decision of the family court imputing \r\n  minimum wage income to Anthony P. Miles (the father) for purposes of awarding \r\n  child support and changing the surname of the parties' minor child from Mazzone \r\n  to Miles. The mother also appeals from the court's failure to award her attorney's \r\n  fees. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nThe parties are the natural parents \r\n  of Lacey, born May 29, 1992. They have never been married. The mother has had \r\n  custody of the child since her birth. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe mother commenced this action \r\n  against the father in November 1997 seeking, among other things, an order establishing \r\n  the father's child support obligation and awarding her attorney's fees. The \r\n  father answered, admitting his child support obligation should be judicially \r\n  established in accordance with the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines, \r\n  and counterclaimed seeking, among other things, visitation and an order changing \r\n  the child's surname from Mazzone, the mother's maiden name, to Miles.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPrior to the commencement of this \r\n  action, the father voluntarily, though sporadically, provided financial support \r\n  for the child, including day care expenses. He had been employed at Crowley's \r\n  American Transport for over five years and was earning $12.50 per hour when \r\n  he was terminated in October 1997. After he was terminated, the father started \r\n  his own tractor trailer repair business. The business was operating at a loss \r\n  at the time of trial. \r\n   \r\nRegarding his request that the child's \r\n  surname be changed to Miles, the father testified he told the mother during \r\n  her pregnancy he wanted the child to have his last name. He also noted he has \r\n  had a close relationship with the child since her birth and, in fact, lived \r\n  with the mother and child for up to two years.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn support of her contention the \r\n  child's surname should not be changed from Mazzone to Miles, the mother testified \r\n  the child was comfortable with her last name. She further stated she did not \r\n  want to confuse the child or cause confusion at the child's school. She explained \r\n  that she refused to put the father's name on the child's birth certificate because \r\n  \"he sort of dogged me through my whole pregnancy and he wasn't supportive.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court judge found the \r\n  father was capable of continuing to pay child support. He imputed minimum wage \r\n  to the father. Applying the Guidelines, the court ordered the father to pay \r\n  $172.63 per month. Further, the court found the child's best interest would \r\n  be served by ordering her surname changed from Mazzone to Miles. Additionally, \r\n  the court ordered each party to pay his or her own attorney's fees and costs. \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nIn appeals from the family court, \r\n  this Court has the authority to find facts in accordance with our own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence. Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 466 \r\n  S.E.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1996). This broad scope of review does not, however, require \r\n  this Court to disregard the findings of the family court. Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 279 S.E.2d 616 (1981). Neither are we required to ignore the fact \r\n  that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. \r\n  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe mother asserts the family court \r\n  erred in imputing only minimum wage to the father. She contends the father's \r\n  employment potential is considerably greater.\r\n \r\nUnder the South Carolina Child Support \r\n  Guidelines, \"income\" is defined as \"the actual gross income of the parent, if \r\n  employed to full capacity, or potential income if unemployed or under employed.\" \r\n  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720 (1) (Supp. 1998). Regarding the imputation \r\n  of income, the Guidelines provide in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPotential Income. If the court \r\n  finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed or under employed, it should calculate \r\n  child support based on a determination of potential income which would otherwise \r\n  ordinarily be available to the parent . . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\n (b) In order to impute income to \r\n  a parent who is unemployed or under employed, the court should determine the \r\n  employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent based on that \r\n  parent's recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job \r\n  opportunities and earning levels in the community. \r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(b) \r\n  (Supp. 1998).(1)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe father testified he was fired \r\n  from his job at Crowley's for refusing to participate in fraudulent activity. \r\n  He explained there were few jobs available similar to his job at Crowley's. \r\n  He admitted, however, that he declined an offer of employment as a repairman \r\n  which would have paid $10.50 per hour.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the time of trial, the father's \r\n  tractor trailer repair business was less than a year old and had suffered a \r\n  net loss. In partial explanation of the business's failure to produce a profit, \r\n  the father testified his business expenses were greater than he had anticipated. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThere is no evidence indicating the \r\n  father's loss of his prior job was because of any wrongdoing. Moreover, there \r\n  is no evidence his decision to start his own business was motivated by a desire \r\n  to avoid his support obligation. Rather, the evidence indicates the father made \r\n  a good-faith decision to pursue self-employment. The fact that the newly-formed \r\n  business has not yet shown a profit does not constitute a showing the father's \r\n  efforts at making the business a success have been less than sincere. See \r\n  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 488, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (\"[T]he failure to reach earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically \r\n  equate to voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.\"); Kelley, \r\n  324 S.C. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at 731 (Where actual income versus earning capacity \r\n  is at issue, courts are to closely examine the payor's good-faith and reasonable \r\n  explanation for the decreased income.). Furthermore, the father is required \r\n  to submit financial reports of his business every six months to the mother so \r\n  that she can be aware of any increased profit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the facts and circumstances \r\n  of this case, we find no error in the family court's decision to impute only \r\n  minimum wage to the father for purposes of computing his child support obligation. \r\n  See Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. 624, 216 S.E.2d 541 (1975) (The amount \r\n  of child support ordered is within the discretion of the trial court.). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNext, the mother asserts the family \r\n  court erred in ordering the child's surname changed to Miles.(2) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nInitially, we note the mother raised \r\n  for the first time on appeal the family court's failure to appoint a guardian \r\n  ad litem to represent the child's interest pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-49-10(B) \r\n  (Supp. 1999).(3) Because the failure to appoint \r\n  a guardian ad litem does not affect the jurisdiction of the family court, it \r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Nicholson v. Mull, 266 \r\n  S.C. 559, 562, 225 S.E.2d 186, 188 (1976) (\"The issue concerning the failure \r\n  to appoint a guardian ad litem in this action for the minor was not raised below \r\n  and, not being jurisdictional, cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\"). \r\n  As such, we need not address this issue, but instead, proceed to analyze the \r\n  merits of the surname change.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n In deciding whether to allow a change \r\n  in the child's surname, the family court should grant the request only if the \r\n  change promotes the child's best interests and welfare. Ex Parte Stull, \r\n  276 S.C. 512, 280 S.E.2d 209 (1981). The parent seeking to change the child's \r\n  surname has the burden of proving that the change will further the child's best \r\n  interests. Girten v. Andreu, 698 So. 2d 886 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997); \r\n  Barabas v. Rogers, 868 S.W.2d 283 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur appellate courts have not set \r\n  out guidelines for when the change of a surname is in a child's best interests. \r\n  However, other jurisdictions which have addressed this issue have considered \r\n  a number of factors. Although this is not an exhaustive list, the following \r\n  factors provide guidance for our decision: (1) the length of time that the child \r\n  has used the present surname; (2) the effect of the change on the preservation \r\n  and development of the child's relationship with each parent; (3) the identification \r\n  of the child as part of a family unit; (4) the wishes of the parents; (5) the \r\n  stated reason for the proposed change; (6) the motive of the parents and the \r\n  possibility that the use of a different name will cause insecurity or a lack \r\n  of identity; (7) the difficulty, harassment, or embarrassment that the child \r\n  may experience when the child bears a surname different from the custodial parent; \r\n  (8) the preference of the child if the child is of an age and maturity to express \r\n  a meaningful preference; and (9) the degree of community respect associated \r\n  with the present and proposed surname. Pizziconi v. Yarbrough, 868 P.2d \r\n  1005 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993); Bobo v. Jewell, 528 N.E.2d 180 (Ohio 1988); \r\n  Barabas v. Rogers, 868 S.W.2d 283 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993); see Jay \r\n  M. Zitter, Annotation, Rights and Remedies of Parents Inter Se with Respect \r\n  to the Names of Their Children, 40 A.L.R.5th 697 (1996 &amp; Supp. 1999) \r\n  (analyzing cases involving questions as to the right of one parent, against \r\n  the objection or without consent of the other, to have the name of their child \r\n  changed); 57 Am. Jur. 2d Name Â§Â§ 46-54 (1988 &amp; Supp. 1999) (discussing \r\n  factors court should consider in determining a minor child's best interest with \r\n  respect to a change of name).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nApplying the above factors which \r\n  are applicable in this case, we find there is insufficient evidence to support \r\n  the family court's conclusion that the change in name is in the best interests \r\n  of the child. The only testimony offered by the father regarding the name change \r\n  was his desire for the child to bear his name \"[b]ecause she is [his] daughter.\" \r\n  He also expressed concern that the mother had taught the child to refer to him \r\n  as \"Daddy Tony\" and the mother's boyfriend as \"Daddy Bruce.\" The father, however, \r\n  did not institute any formal proceeding to change the child's name before the \r\n  mother filed the present action. Although the father lived briefly with the \r\n  mother and child, has visited the child, and has sporadically paid support, \r\n  these actions alone are not sufficient to satisfy the father's burden of proving \r\n  the name change is in the child's best interests. The mother has been the custodial \r\n  parent since the child's birth, and the child has been known by her surname. \r\n  The mother testified the child is \"comfortable with her last name.\" The mother \r\n  further testified because the child knows her name as \"Lacy Mazzone,\" a change \r\n  to the father's name would create confusion for the child and the administration \r\n  at the school she attends.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Although we recognize the father \r\n  has a protectible interest in having the child bear his surname, his interest \r\n  is not greater than the mother's interest. Instead, both parents have an equal \r\n  interest in the child bearing their respective surname. See Ex Parte \r\n  Stull, 276 S.C. at 513, 280 S.E.2d at 210 (\"[B]ecause the father has a protectible \r\n  interest in having his child bear the paternal surname, even though the mother \r\n  has been awarded custody of the child, he should be notified of any proceedings \r\n  for a change in his minor child's surname and be allowed to participate in the \r\n  hearing if he so desires.\") (citation omitted); Bobo, 528 N.E.2d at 185 \r\n  (\"While it may be a custom to name a child after the father, giving greater \r\n  weight to the father's interest fails to consider that, where the parents have \r\n  never been married, the mother has at least an equal interest in having the \r\n  child bear the maternal surname. In these times of parental equality, arguing \r\n  that the child of unmarried parents should bear the paternal surname based on \r\n  custom is another way of arguing that it is permissible to discriminate because \r\n  the discrimination has been endured for many years.\").  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the facts of this particular \r\n  case, we do not find the record affirmatively shows the name change is in the \r\n  child's best interest. See Girten v. Andreu, 698 So. 2d 886, 888 \r\n  (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) (\"'To change the name of a [child] . . . is a serious \r\n  matter, and such action may be taken only where the record affirmatively shows \r\n  that such change is required for the welfare of the [child].'\") (quoting Lazow \r\n  v. Lazow, 147 So. 2d 12, 14 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1962)); see, e.g., \r\n  Girten, 698 So. 2d at 888 (where child was born to unmarried parents, \r\n  trial judge erred in changing the child's maternal surname to that of the father, \r\n  finding the father failed to meet his burden of proving the name change was \r\n  in the child's best interest when the only evidence presented was the father's \r\n  desire that the child bear his surname and his concern that the use of the mother's \r\n  surname would allow the mother greater influence over the child); Sullivan \r\n  v. McGaw, 480 N.E.2d 1283 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) (holding trial court erred \r\n  in ordering name of child, who was born to unmarried parents, changed to the \r\n  father's surname where there was no evidence in the record the court considered \r\n  any of the suggested factors but merely articulated that the child's name should \r\n  be changed); Lufft v. Lufft, 424 S.E.2d 266 (W. Va. 1992) (concluding \r\n  trial court erred in changing minor child's surname from the mother's maiden \r\n  name to the father's surname, reasoning the name change was not in the child's \r\n  best interest given: (1) the child had never held the father's surname, (2) \r\n  the father made no effort to change the child's surname before the divorce proceeding, \r\n  and (3) the father's primary reason for the name change was his fear that the \r\n  child would be considered illegitimate).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTherefore, we reverse the decision \r\n  of the family court ordering the name change and remand for an order to reinstate \r\n  the child's surname to Mazzone. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, the mother asserts the family \r\n  court erred in failing to award her attorney's fees.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn denying the mother's request for \r\n  attorney's fees, the court reasoned that the mother failed to prevail on a majority \r\n  of the issues raised in her Complaint, whereas the father had prevailed on the \r\n  issues raised in his Counterclaim. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe award of attorney's fees is within \r\n  the discretion of the court. Hardwick v. Hardwick, 303 S.C. 256, 399 \r\n  S.E.2d 791 (Ct. App. 1990). In determining whether to award attorney's fees, \r\n  the court should consider each party's ability to pay his or her own fee; the \r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the parties' respective financial \r\n  conditions; and the effect of the fee on each party's standard of living. E.D.M. \r\n  v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992). In determining \r\n  the amount of attorney's fees to award, the court should consider the nature, \r\n  extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted \r\n  to the case, counsel's professional standing, the contingency of compensation, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. \r\n  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nEven though the court based its decision \r\n  solely on whether each party prevailed on his or her respective issues, we find \r\n  there is sufficient support in the record to affirm the decision. See \r\n  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 440 S.E.2d 884 (1994) (In family court \r\n  actions, this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.); cf. Townsend v. Townsend, \r\n  323 S.C. 309, 318, 474 S.E.2d 424, 430 (1996) (where order awarding attorney's \r\n  fees does not contain specific findings of fact, \"reversal is not warranted \r\n  as long as each factor is supported by evidence in the Record.\"); Robinson \r\n  v. Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 461 S.E.2d 397 (Ct. App. 1995) (no abuse of discretion \r\n  in ordering payment of attorney's fees where record contains sufficient evidentiary \r\n  support for the award). \r\n   \r\nAlthough the mother's attorney achieved \r\n  a beneficial result in terms of the family court's award of child support and \r\n  related relief, this alone is not dispositive of whether mother was entitled \r\n  to an award of attorney's fees. A review of the parties' child support obligation \r\n  worksheet and financial declarations reveals the mother has the ability to pay \r\n  for her attorney's fees. In fact, her income is slightly greater than the father's. \r\n  In light of the financial situations of each party, we find neither party is \r\n  in a superior financial position to pay for the other's attorney fees. Accordingly, \r\n  we cannot conclude the family court abused its discretion in denying the mother's \r\n  request. \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  We refer to \r\n  this version of the regulation because it was in effect at the time of the hearing. \r\n  We note, however, the regulation has been rewritten. The amended regulation \r\n  became effective March 26, 1999. See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720 \r\n  (Supp. 1999). \r\n2.  This issue \r\n  is limited to an analysis of the surname change. At trial, the mother did not \r\n  object to having the father's name added to the child's birth certificate. \r\n3.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-49-10(B) (Supp. 1999) provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA parent who desires to change the \r\n  name of his minor child may petition, in writing, a family court judge in the \r\n  appropriate circuit. The other parent, if there is not one then the child, must \r\n  be named as a party in the action unless waived by the court. The court shall \r\n  appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child. The court shall grant the \r\n  petition if it finds that it is in the best interest of the child. \r\n4.  Taking our \r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we agree with the mother that \r\n  the family court erred in changing the child's surname. Based on the specific \r\n  facts of this case, we do not believe the appointment of a guardian ad litem \r\n  would have affected our decision. Therefore, we express no opinion whether section \r\n  15-49-10(B) mandates that a guardian ad litem be appointed in future cases. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3186","title":"State v.

Green appeals, arguing \r\n  the trial court erred in (1) finding the arresting officer made a lawful stop \r\n  based only on an uncorroborated anonymous tip; (2) finding a frisk for weapons \r\n  was justified; and (3) finding the arresting officer acquired knowledge of drug \r\n  possession while conducting a frisk for weapons. We reverse. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY  \r\nWhile on duty at the corner \r\n  of Morrison Drive and Romney Streets, Sgt. James Mackey (the officer) received \r\n  a cellular telephone call from the Police Dispatcher. The officer was notified \r\n  that a \"black male by the name of Alonzo Green * * * was leaving the area of \r\n  Bayside Manor.\" The anonymous caller also reported Green was driving a gray \r\n  four-door Maxima and had just left a residence in Bayside Manor with a large \r\n  sum of money and narcotics. While still on the telephone, the officer saw Green, \r\n  whom he knew by sight, driving a gray Maxima traveling away from Bayside Manor. \r\n  Based solely on the anonymous tip, the officer pulled Green over. \r\n   \r\nAs the officer approached \r\n  the vehicle, he noticed Green fumbling under the front seat. The officer testified \r\n  that this fumbling led him to believe Green may have been in possession of a \r\n  weapon. After asking Green to step out of the vehicle, the officer frisked him \r\n  for weapons. Subsequent to this frisk, Green was found to be in possession of \r\n  narcotics and a large some of money. The handgun was found later under the front \r\n  seat of the vehicle.  \r\n   \r\nGreen's attorney moved to \r\n  suppress the evidence, alleging the stop and the frisk were both violations \r\n  of the Fourth Amendment. The trial judge denied the Motion to Suppress. Green \r\n  was then convicted in a bench trial on May 4, 1999. This appeal follows. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n   \r\nGreen argues the trial judge \r\n  erred in finding the officer made a lawful stop and had reasonable suspicion \r\n  based only on an uncorroborated anonymous tip. We agree. \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge concluded \r\n  the stop was proper and based his finding of probable cause(1) \r\n  for the stop on Alabama v. White. 496 U.S. 325 (1990). In White, \r\n  police received an anonymous telephone tip that White would leave a particular \r\n  apartment at a specific time with cocaine in her possession. The caller also \r\n  informed police, in detail, what vehicle White would drive and her final destination. \r\n  The police proceeded to the named location and witnessed a woman with an attache \r\n  case enter a vehicle that matched the caller's description. They followed the \r\n  vehicle for several miles and stopped the vehicle just short of the motel the \r\n  caller described as White's final destination. A consensual search revealed \r\n  marijuana and, after White was arrested, cocaine in her purse. The Court held \r\n  that the anonymous tip exhibited a sufficient indication of reliability to provide \r\n  reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop. This finding was based \r\n  on the fact that the caller's story was sufficiently corroborated by the police \r\n  and the caller was able to predict future behavior, which demonstrated a familiarity \r\n  with White's affairs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn contrast, the Court recently \r\n  held that reasonable suspicion based solely on a call made from an unknown location \r\n  by an unknown caller lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to make an investigatory \r\n  stop. Florida v. J.L., ___ U.S. ___, 120 S.Ct. 1375 (March 28, 2000) \r\n  (Kennedy, J., and Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).(2) \r\n  In J.L., the police received an anonymous tip that a young black male, \r\n  standing at a particular bus stop, wearing a plaid shirt, was carrying a gun. \r\n  Officers went to the bus stop and observed three black males, one of whom was \r\n  wearing a plaid shirt. They frisked all three males, based only on the anonymous \r\n  tip, and found a gun in J.L.'s pocket. The Court found that the tip provided \r\n  no predictive information and therefore left the police no way to test the knowledge \r\n  or credibility of the anonymous caller. The Court stated:\r\nAn accurate description \r\n  of a subject's readily observable location and appearance is of course reliable \r\n  in this limited sense: It will help the police correctly identify the person \r\n  whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that the \r\n  tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity. [R]easonable suspicion \r\n  . . . requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just \r\n  in its tendency to identify a determinate person. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nJ.L., ___ U.S. at \r\n  ___, 120 S.Ct. at 1379.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn reaching its decision \r\n  in J.L., the Court noted that \"[i]f White was a close case on \r\n  the reliability of anonymous tips, this one surely falls on the other side of \r\n  the line.\" Id. We believe that the facts in this case are similar to \r\n  those in J.L. and therefore, this case also falls on the other side of \r\n  the line because the anonymous tip is not reliable enough to justify a Terry \r\n  stop.  \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, the \r\n  anonymous caller provided police with Green's name, a description of the car \r\n  he was driving, and the location he would be departing. These items are readily \r\n  observable and do not supply sufficient indicia of reliability to establish \r\n  reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop. The officer made no personal \r\n  observations and had no reason, aside from the anonymous tip, to suspect Green \r\n  of illegal conduct.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, the anonymous \r\n  caller provided no predictive information, leaving the police without any means \r\n  to test the his knowledge or credibility. Simply stating Green would leave Bayside \r\n  Manor on a certain road does not rise to the level of predictive information \r\n  when there are only two possible exits. The fact the allegation about the money \r\n  and narcotics turned out to be correct does not suggest the officer, prior to \r\n  the stop and frisk, had a reasonable basis for suspecting Green of engaging \r\n  in unlawful conduct. The only information available to the officer was the statement \r\n  of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about \r\n  the money and narcotics, nor supplied any basis for the officer to believe he \r\n  had inside information about Green. See J.L., ___ U.S. at ___, \r\n  120 S.Ct. at 1379. Since the telephone call was anonymous, the caller did not \r\n  place his credibility at risk and could lie with impunity. Therefore, we cannot \r\n  judge the credibility of the caller, and the risk of fabrication becomes unacceptable. \r\n  See J.L., ___ U.S. at ___, 120 S.Ct. at 1381 (Kennedy, J., concurring) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe note \"the requirement \r\n  that an anonymous tip bear standard indicia of reliability in order to justify \r\n  a stop in no way diminishes a police officer's prerogative, in accord with Terry, \r\n  to conduct a protective search of a person who has already been legitimately \r\n  stopped.\" J.L., ___ U.S. at ___, 120 S.Ct. at 1380. Applying the more \r\n  deferential standard established in State v. Brockman, Op. No. 25069, \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 22, 2000) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 1)(3), \r\n  we find no evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the anonymous \r\n  tip in the present case provided sufficient indicia of reliability to make an \r\n  investigatory stop. Therefore, it was clear error for the trial court to allow \r\n  the introduction of the evidence recovered during this investigatory stop. Since \r\n  we find that all the evidence from this investigatory stop should have been \r\n  suppressed, we need not address Green's other arguments.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased on the foregoing reasons, \r\n  all evidence resulting from this stop should have been suppressed. Since the \r\n  charges against Green can not be sustained without this evidence, Green's convictions \r\n  in the present case are \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nCONNOR, and STILWELL, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n1. \r\n Although the trial judge found \r\nthere was probable cause, we note both sides argued the correct standard of reasonable \r\nsuspicion to the trial judge. We find that this misstatement by the trial judge \r\nis immaterial to our review and does not affect our decision.  \r\n2.  The \r\n  trial judge did not have the benefit of this decision at the time he made his \r\n  ruling. \r\n3.  In \r\n  State v. Brockman, our supreme court determined the appellate standard \r\n  of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining \r\n  whether any evidence supports the trial court's finding and the appellate court \r\n  may only reverse where there is clear error. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3187","title":"State v.

The State appeals. We \r\n  affirm.  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn the morning of March 4, 1994, \r\n  a fire destroyed the Pageland trailer-home of Evans and killed her three small \r\n  children. Evans survived as she was visiting her sister's nearby home at the \r\n  time of the fire. Later that day, arson investigator Terry Alexander of the \r\n  South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) obtained Evans's permission to \r\n  search the burned-out trailer, but she refused to give Alexander a written statement. \r\n  An initial test of the site revealed the presence of a flammable substance in \r\n  the debris. Samples were collected for later analysis at SLED's laboratory to \r\n  determine the type of accelerant present at the commencement of the fire. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAgent Alexander did not return to \r\n  Pageland until after the children's funerals. Around lunchtime on March 14, \r\n  1994, he attempted to contact Evans at the home of her cousin where she had \r\n  been staying since the fire, but Evans was not there. He left word with an occupant \r\n  of the house to ask Evans to \"come to the Pageland Police Department for the \r\n  purposes [sic] of talking to me about the fire.\" Between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m, \r\n  Evans's cousin, Inez Robinson, drove Evans to Pageland's police station.(2) \r\n  Alexander and his supervisor, SLED Lieutenant Doug Ross, escorted Evans back \r\n  to a detective's office in the station which they had borrowed to conduct the \r\n  interview. Robinson and several other family members who had accompanied Evans \r\n  to the station were left in the station's waiting room. Robinson asked if she \r\n  could accompany Evans because \"she's quiet,\" and Robinson wanted to be with \r\n  her, but the officers refused. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOnce inside the small detective's \r\n  office, Evans agreed to talk with Agent Alexander and Lt. Ross. She told them \r\n  that on the morning of the fire, she arose just before 9:00 a.m., lit a kerosene \r\n  heater, then left her children asleep in the trailer while she went next door \r\n  to visit her sister. Minutes after her arrival, Evans's sister said she smelled \r\n  smoke, so Evans looked out the window and saw her trailer in flames. Evans testified \r\n  that she rushed back to the trailer and attempted to gain entry, but was barred \r\n  by the flames. When asked what caused the fire, Evans opined that it could have \r\n  been caused by either dogs under the trailer, her sister's son playing with \r\n  matches, or a faulty electrical outlet. During the interview, Alexander took \r\n  notes on a \"Voluntary Statement\" form, but he neither asked Evans to read the \r\n  form nor advised her of the Miranda(3) \r\n  rights contained thereon. \r\n   \r\nAgent Alexander testified that although \r\n  Evans was \"very cooperative\" during the interview, she was also upset and sobbing. \r\n  At times, Evans would speak so softly that Alexander could barely understand \r\n  her. She would also clutch the agent's hands and ask him for help. Although \r\n  Alexander repeatedly asked her what type of help she required, Evans never responded \r\n  with a specific request. Alexander testified that he felt the interview was \r\n  very unproductive and tried to end it on several occasions, but claimed that \r\n  Evans would respond with tears and repeat her request for help. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLieutenant Ross confirmed Alexander's \r\n  account of the interview. He testified that \"the interview seemed to be -- you \r\n  know -- basically no help at all\" and \"was a very long drawn out event\" which \r\n  lasted two or three hours. Ross also claims to have been unsuccessful in ending \r\n  the interview. \r\n   \r\nAfter more than an hour of questioning, \r\n  the two agents stepped into the hall outside the interview room to confer about \r\n  Evans's statement. Ross testified that he suggested to agent Jennifer Edwards \r\n  of SLED's child fatality unit to \"go in and talk to [Evans], see if [Edwards] \r\n  could - you know - get anything different than we already had.\" Edwards testified \r\n  she spent \"approximately 45 minutes to an hour\" alone with Evans trying to comfort \r\n  her. Edwards maintains she was just \"having a conversation\" with Evans the whole \r\n  time and \"was not on a fact-finding mission.\" On at least one occasion, Edwards \r\n  escorted Evans to the bathroom and \"stood outside the door\" because, according \r\n  to her, she thought Evans may try to harm herself. When they returned to the \r\n  interview room, Evans continued to plead for help. Edwards responded: \"Florence, \r\n  I don't know what kind of help you need until you tell me.\" Evans then whispered, \r\n  \"I dropped a lit piece of paper on the floor. . . .I walked next door and waited \r\n  until somebody saw the fire.\" Edwards immediately summoned Ross and asked Evans \r\n  to repeat what she had said. Evans complied. Ross called in Alexander and Evans \r\n  again repeated the statement. As a result, Alexander added another paragraph \r\n  to his notes on the Voluntary Statement form: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI dropped a lit piece of paper on \r\n  the floor. I rolled it up and lit it. It was writing paper. I dropped the paper \r\n  on a rug. The rug caught on fire and I went out the front door. I went next \r\n  door to my sisters [sic] house and just waited. I waited about two hours until \r\n  someone saw the fire. I got some kerosene in a cup and poured it on the rug. \r\n  The fire got bigger and as I left it was burning a lot [sic]. I was hurting \r\n  inside about seeing people do people wrong. Please get me some help. Please \r\n  get me some help. I lit the fire with a match. I don't remember who found the \r\n  fire. I got the kerosene out of the blue jug and put it back on the porch. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe interview ended at 6:01 p.m. \r\n  Alexander read his notes back to Evans and she subsequently signed and initialed \r\n  the \"Voluntary Statement.\" As a result, the officers immediately placed her \r\n  under arrest.  \r\n   \r\nEvans testified that during the interview, \r\n  she repeatedly asked to speak with her cousin, Inez Robinson. She also admitted \r\n  to asking the agents for help. Evans does not deny signing the voluntary statement, \r\n  but claims she thought she \"was signing some [sic] papers to get me some [sic] \r\n  help.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRobinson also attempted to speak \r\n  with Evans during the interview, but was restricted to the station's waiting \r\n  room until after Evans's arrest. Robinson testified that \"[w]hen [Evans] saw \r\n  me, she just run [sic] to me and held me. She said she told them she wanted \r\n  to get to me. . . . She kept crying out to see me. They would not let her see \r\n  me.\" According to Robinson, Evans was \"real shaky\" and \"upset, like if someone \r\n  had scolded her.\" She said Evans told her \"[t]here was some kind of paper they \r\n  wanted her to sign,\" and Evans then declared, \"Inez, I did not kill my babies.\" \r\n  Robinson stated she had \"never seen [Florence] look like that\" and reported \r\n  that Evans told her the officers \"pushed her to sign some papers.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA Chesterfield County grand jury \r\n  indicted Evans on three counts of murder on April 13, 1994. On May 1-4, 1998 \r\n  the trial court held a Jackson v. Denno(4) \r\n  hearing to discuss the admissibility of Evans's oral and written statements \r\n  of March 14, 1994. The trial court suppressed her oral and written statements \r\n  to the police pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). This \r\n  appeal followed.  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur review of a trial court's ruling \r\n  that a person was \"in custody\" for Miranda purposes \"is limited to a \r\n  determination of whether the ruling by the trial court is supported by the testimony.\" \r\n  State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 342, 471 S.E.2d 745, 751 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (citing State v. Primus, 312 S.C. 256, 440 S.E.2d 128 (1994)), modified \r\n  on other grounds, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997). In the instant action, \r\n  the State invites us to adopt a new standard and conduct a de novo review \r\n  of the \"mixed question of law and fact\" pursuant to Thompson v. Keohane, \r\n  516 U.S. 99 (1995). As our Supreme Court has recently rejected a similar de \r\n  novo standard promulgated by the United States Supreme Court in Ornelas \r\n  v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996), we must reject the State's invitation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Keohane, the Supreme Court \r\n  resolved a dispute among the Federal Courts of Appeals concerning the proper \r\n  standard of review in federal habeas corpus proceedings. The Court held that \r\n  \"state-court 'in custody' determinations\" are not entitled to \"a presumption \r\n  of correctness under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2254(d),\" and that the determination of \"whether \r\n  a suspect is 'in custody,' and therefore entitled to Miranda warnings, \r\n  presents a mixed question of law and fact qualifying for independent review.\" \r\n  Id. at 102, 106. In reaching its holding, the Court traced the evolution \r\n  of federal habeas corpus review and differentiated between \"basic, primary, \r\n  or historical facts\" and \"subsidiary factual questions.\" Id. at 110. \r\n  After acknowledging that it has \"'not charted an entirely clear course in this \r\n  area[,]'\" the Court espoused its new theory concerning the \"ultimate 'in custody' \r\n  determination for Miranda purposes . . . .\" Id. at 110, 112 (quoting \r\n  Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 113 (1985)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nShortly after deciding Keohane, \r\n  the Supreme Court resolved a similar conflict among the Federal Courts of Appeals \r\n  concerning the proper standard of review for warrantless searches in federal \r\n  criminal proceedings. In Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 691 \r\n  (1996), the Court held that \"the ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion \r\n  and probable cause to make a warrantless search should be reviewed de novo.\" \r\n  This Court applied the Ornelas de novo standard of review in State \r\n  v. Brockman, 329 S.C. 115, 494 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 1997), but was reversed \r\n  by our supreme court which held that it was not bound by Ornelas even \r\n  though many other states had adopted it. State v. Brockman, Op. No. 25069 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 22, 2000) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 1) (reversing \r\n  State v. Brockman, 329 S.C. 115, 494 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 1997)). \"Ornelas \r\n  was merely a supervisory opinion crafted out of [the United States Supreme] \r\n  Court's policy concerns, and it in no way clarifies our standard of review in \r\n  the instant case.\" Brockman, Op. No. 25069 at 7. Our supreme court also \r\n  noted that at least one other state had also concluded that Ornelas was \r\n  merely a supervisory opinion and not binding upon state courts. Id. at \r\n  6.  \r\n   \r\nKeohane articulates a standard \r\n  of review for the specific context of a federal habeas corpus proceeding and \r\n  in no way suggests that the Court is articulating a new standard of review for \r\n  all Fifth Amendment issues.(5) Keohane's \r\n  holding is much more limited in scope than that which our supreme court rejected \r\n  in Ornelas because Keohane focused upon the unique forum of federal \r\n  habeas corpus, whereas Ornelas reviewed a federal criminal proceeding, \r\n  one of the supreme court's traditional forums for promulgating new rules of \r\n  criminal law. Given that our supreme court has rejected the relatively broader \r\n  Ornelas opinion, it is doubtful it would adopt the much narrower Keohane \r\n  standard. Accordingly, the deferential standard of Easler is still the \r\n  appropriate standard of review. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Miranda, the Supreme Court \r\n  examined various interrogation techniques utilized by police during station-house \r\n  interrogations and concluded many of those techniques amounted to psychological \r\n  ploys aimed at eliciting involuntary confessions from suspects. To protect an \r\n  accused's Fifth Amendment right against such involuntary self-incrimination, \r\n  the Court fashioned the now familiar Miranda warnings which are triggered \r\n  whenever a person is \"subjected to interrogation\" while in \"custody.\" Id. \r\n  at 467-468. The Miranda Court first described a \"custodial interrogation\" \r\n  as \"questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been \r\n  taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant \r\n  way.\" Id. at 444.  \r\n   \r\nIn Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 \r\n  U.S. 492 (1977), the Court applied Miranda to the station-house interview \r\n  of a suspect who had voluntarily agreed to the interview and met the \r\n  police at the station for that purpose. The Court held such an interview did \r\n  not amount to \"custody\" for purposes of Miranda because \"there is no \r\n  indication that the questioning took place in a context where respondent's \r\n  freedom to depart was restricted in any way. . . . At the close of a Â½-hour \r\n  interview respondent did in fact leave the police station . . . .\" Id. \r\n  at 495.  \r\n   \r\nIn California v. Beheler, \r\n  463 U.S. 1121 (1983), the Court reaffirmed Mathiason and rejected the \r\n  California Court of Appeal's \"totality of circumstances\" analysis of custody \r\n  determinations. \"Although the circumstances of each case must certainly influence \r\n  a determination of whether a suspect is 'in custody' for purposes of receiving \r\n  Miranda protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a 'formal \r\n  arrest or restraint on freedom of movement' of the degree associated with \r\n  a formal arrest.\" Id. at 1125 (quoting Mathiason, 429 U.S. \r\n  at 495) (emphasis added).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the intervening years since Beheler, \r\n  several state courts have promulgated criteria for determining whether what \r\n  was initially a voluntary station-house interview becomes a custodial interrogation \r\n  for Miranda purposes. In Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318 \r\n  (1994), the Supreme Court reviewed California's criteria in a case where a suspect \r\n  in a child homicide voluntarily accompanied police to their station for an interview. \r\n  The Court neither endorsed nor rejected California's approach, but held that \r\n  while \"a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, \r\n  . . . 'the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there [was] a \"formal \r\n  arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\" of the degree associated with a \r\n  formal arrest.'\" 511 U.S. at 322 (quoting Beheler, 463 U.S. at 1125) \r\n  (second alteration in original) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTherefore, the ultimate inquiry in \r\n  the instant action is whether the interview of Evans so restrained her freedom \r\n  of movement as to be the functional equivalent of a formal arrest.(6) \r\n    \r\nApplying an objective standard, the \r\n  trial judge concluded Evans's interview rose above the level of a \"routine inquiry\" \r\n  to that of Miranda's custodial interrogation. The record supports a conclusion \r\n  that during the interview, Evans experienced restrictions on her freedom of \r\n  movement which are consistent with a formal arrest. First, she was separated \r\n  from family members and not allowed any contact with them during the interview. \r\n  Secondly, she was not allowed to leave the interview room alone to care for \r\n  any of her personal needs during this long and emotional interview. If she needed \r\n  water or a tissue, it was brought to her in the interview room. When she had \r\n  to use the bathroom, she was escorted by an agent even though the bathroom was \r\n  only across the hall from the interview room. Thirdly, Evans's pleas for help \r\n  were ignored and the interview continued despite the ready availability of Evans's \r\n  family members who were the logical source of solace for a grieving victim of \r\n  a crime where law enforcement, by its own admission, did not know what type \r\n  of help she required. Lastly, the fulfillment of the ostensible purpose of the \r\n  informational interview - a statement concerning the fire - did not terminate \r\n  Evans's encounter with law enforcement. The interview continued for three hours, \r\n  during which time the officers continually questioned Evans's speculations concerning \r\n  the origin of the fire. When viewed in its totality, Evans's treatment was consistent \r\n  with a formal arrest. \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHUFF, J., concurs and HOWARD, \r\n  J., dissents in separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWARD, J., (dissenting): \r\n   I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that the evidence \r\n  supports the trial judge's ruling. I conclude the evidence clearly demonstrates, \r\n  from an objective viewpoint, that the defendant's freedom of movement was not \r\n  so restrained as to be the functional equivalent of a formal arrest. See \r\n  State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997); Stansbury v. \r\n  California, 511 U.S. 318 (1994).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe defendant voluntarily came to \r\n  the police station. The length of the ensuing interview is of no significance \r\n  in determining custodial status, because the officers continually attempted \r\n  to terminate it and send her home. It was the defendant's conduct which prolonged \r\n  the interview. Nothing was communicated to the defendant which would indicate \r\n  she was not free to leave. In fact, even after confessing to the crime, the \r\n  defendant undeniably demonstrated that she did not believe she was under arrest. \r\n  She picked up her belongings, said goodbye, and attempted to leave, claiming \r\n  she needed to go to church. She clearly did not believe she was in custody. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough the trial court articulated \r\n  the appropriate objective standard, I believe the circumstances were weighed \r\n  under a subjective standard, viewing them from the perspective of the defendant's \r\n  mental handicap. This was legal error. See Stansbury, 511 U.S. \r\n  at 323 (\"Our decisions make clear that the initial determination of custody \r\n  depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective \r\n  views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\"). \r\n  In my opinion, the evidence is susceptible to only one reasonable conclusion, \r\n  and that is that the oral confession was the product of a non-custodial interview. \r\n  At least as to the initial confession, I would rule that the trial court erred \r\n  in excluding it, and would reverse and remand for further consideration of the \r\n  second, oral confession and the written confession. \r\n1.  Throughout \r\n  the record, the defendant is referred to as both Florence Evans and Florence \r\n  Robinson. For the sake of clarity, Evans is used exclusively in this opinion. \r\n  \r\n2.  Inez Robinson \r\n  is married to Evans's first cousin; she raised Evans and her siblings after \r\n  their mother died. At the hearing, Robinson testified she took Evans to the \r\n  police station after Evans told her \"the law\" was looking for her. \r\n3.  Miranda \r\n  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). \r\n4.

The restraints \r\n  on Evans's freedom of movement must be measured by an objective standard. State \r\n  v.

Kathy Padgett, an \r\n  animal control officer, responded to the call and enticed the dog to the fence \r\n  in an effort to place the noose of a control stick, five feet in length, around \r\n  its neck. \r\n   \r\nPadgett testified, \"[o]nce I knew \r\n  I had control of him, I was able to open the fence to bring him out around to \r\n  the backside of my truck.\" Padgett then climbed onto the tailgate of her truck \r\n  and lifted the dog into the back of the truck. When she did so, she \"heard and \r\n  felt something in [her] shoulder pop.\" At all times during this maneuver, Padgett \r\n  had control of the dog's neck so that it could not turn its head towards her \r\n  and bite.  \r\n   \r\nPadgett subsequently filed this action \r\n  against the Mercados to recover for the injury to her shoulder. Padgett alleged \r\n  a violation of South Carolina Code section 47-3-110. This section provides in \r\n  pertinent part: \r\n   \r\nWhenever any person is bitten or \r\n  otherwise attacked by a dog while the person is in a public place or is lawfully \r\n  in a private place, including the property of the owner of the dog or other \r\n  person having the dog in his care or keeping, the owner of the dog or other \r\n  person having the dog in his care or keeping is liable for the damages suffered \r\n  by the person bitten or otherwise attacked.(2)\r\nPadgett moved for summary judgment, \r\n  arguing there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the Mercados' liability. \r\n  The Mercados countered with their own motion for summary judgment, asserting \r\n  there was no evidence from which liability could be inferred because Padgett \r\n  testified she was not \"bitten or otherwise attacked\" as the statute requires. \r\n  The circuit court agreed with the Mercados and granted summary judgment in their \r\n  favor.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nIn ruling on a summary judgment motion, \r\n  the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.(3) \r\n  Generally, if the pleadings and evidentiary matter in support of summary judgment \r\n  do not establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment \r\n  must be denied, even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.(4) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFirst, Padgett argues the statute \r\n  is a strict liability statute. Although we agree, she must still prove that \r\n  there was an attack.  \r\n   \r\nThe word \"attack\" implies the taking \r\n  of initiative in a struggle.(5) Similarly, \"to \r\n  attack\" has been defined as any hostile offensive action.(6) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPadgett's injury arose not from an \r\n  attack but from her lifting a large, struggling dog onto her truck. Her injury \r\n  does not, therefore, come within the purview of the statute.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Bailey v. Bly,(7) \r\n  a woman who stumbled over a sleeping dog argued a similar statute imposed absolute \r\n  liability on dog owners for injuries resulting from contact with their dog.(8) \r\n  The Illinois Court of Appeals found the woman was not attacked or injured by \r\n  the dog. Similarly, we find the Mercados' dog did not \"otherwise attack\" Padgett \r\n  as is required by the statute.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn contrast to the facts of this \r\n  case, every case Padgett relies on involves a dog that initiated an attack.(9) \r\n  These cases are, therefore, inapplicable to the facts of the case at bar. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Padgett secondly argues the facts \r\n  of this case are in dispute. Padgett, however, conceded the dog never bit or \r\n  touched her. She testified her shoulder injury resulted from her own efforts \r\n  in attempting to lift a heavy dog by its neck from the end of the pole. Viewing \r\n  the evidence and inferences which can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable \r\n  to Padgett, we find no evidence of factual dispute in this case.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Padgett argues the circuit \r\n  court order incorrectly summarized and characterized the facts. Any argument \r\n  alleging an inaccuracy or inconsistency in an order must be raised by a post-trial \r\n  motion.(10) Padgett did not raise this issue \r\n  in a post-trial motion; therefore, it is not preserved for review on appeal. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur. \r\n   \r\n1.

Waste Management appeals. We affirm.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn July 1, 1994, the City of Columbia \r\n  Metro Waste Water Treatment Plant (MWWTP) contracted with Chambers Waste Systems \r\n  of South Carolina, Inc. (Chambers) to haul away grit from waste water and non-degradable \r\n  solid waste for disposal. The grit and other waste was removed at the plant \r\n  and deposited into twenty-cubic-yard waste containers supplied by Chambers. \r\n  When it rained, water would seep into these containers. Because the \r\n  water was known to leak out after the containers were loaded for hauling, causing \r\n  potential highway safety problems, Chambers instructed its haulers not to accept \r\n  containers in which rainwater had accumulated. Instead, MWWTP would dispatch \r\n  a plant employee to dig a trench in the grit waste and drain the water before \r\n  hauling.  \r\n   \r\nOn the morning of August 14, 1996, \r\n  Anthony Adams, a driver employed by Chambers, arrived at the plant to pick up \r\n  and haul a container of grit to the landfill. Adams noticed excess water in \r\n  the container and walked to the maintenance shop to find someone who could drain \r\n  it. When he returned to the site where the container was, Adams discovered that \r\n  the water was still there. He lifted one end of the container about one and \r\n  a half feet onto his truck to facilitate drainage. Because MWWTP plant employees \r\n  were responsible for draining such water, Terrence Bryant, a lead operator who \r\n  had worked at MWWTP for several years, was called to the scene. \r\nBryant arrived with a shovel and \r\n  began digging a trench in the grit. As he spoke with Adams, the eleven-ton container \r\n  slipped off the truck and partially crushed Bryant's left foot. Despite emergency \r\n  efforts, the front half of his foot was later amputated. As a result, Bryant \r\n  was hospitalized for several days and missed over eighteen weeks of work. He \r\n  now has impairment ratings of sixteen per cent to the person, forty per cent \r\n  to the lower extremity, and fifty-seven per cent to the left foot.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn February 14, 1997, Bryant commenced \r\n  this action for negligence against Chambers and Adams, among others.(1) \r\n  On September 28, 1998, Bryant filed a motion to amend and designate Waste Management \r\n  as the real party in interest. The trial court heard and granted the motion \r\n  on the first day of trial, October 12. As a result, the court dismissed Chambers \r\n  and substituted Waste Management as the party defendant. Adams was dismissed \r\n  later during trial. On October 16, the jury returned a verdict for Bryant in \r\n  the amount of $750,000 actual and $1 million punitive damages. The trial court \r\n  subsequently reduced the actual damages by twenty per cent for Bryant's comparative \r\n  negligence and denied all post-trial motions. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management first argues the \r\n  trial court erred in granting Bryant's motion to add it to the suit as the real \r\n  party in interest. Although the motion was styled as a \"Motion to Amend and \r\n  to Join the Real Party in Interest,\" in actuality, it was a motion to substitute \r\n  a party pursuant to Rule 25(c), SCRCP, because the litigation had commenced \r\n  at the time of the transfer in interest.(2)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 25(c) provides: \"In case of \r\n  any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original \r\n  party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest \r\n  is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original \r\n  party.\"(3) Rule 25(c) applies to the transfer \r\n  of interest from one corporation to another with which the first merged.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the trial court found Waste \r\n  Management was the proper party defendant because Chambers, the original defendant, \r\n  had been subsumed by USA Waste Services, which in turn merged with Waste Management. \r\n  One of the distinguishing characteristics of a merger is that \"the surviving \r\n  corporation has all liabilities and obligations of each corporation party to \r\n  the merger.\"(5) When a corporate defendant is \r\n  absorbed by merger during the pendency of an action against it, the plaintiff \r\n  is entitled to have the absorbing corporation substituted as a party defendant.(6)\r\nA trial court has the sound discretion \r\n  to substitute parties when some act has affected the capacity of a named party \r\n  to be sued,(7) and its decision will not be reversed \r\n  on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.(8) \r\n  Here, ample evidence supports the trial court's ruling that a merger had occurred \r\n  between USA Waste Services and Waste Management: (1) the deposition and trial \r\n  testimony of Wally Briscoe, a district manager of Waste Management(9) \r\n  \r\n; (2) the trial \r\n  testimony of Anthony Adams, operator of the container truck(10); \r\n  (3) the trial testimony of John O'Neil, an operations manager for Waste Management(11); \r\n  (4) documentary evidence(12); and (5) the fact \r\n  that Waste Management did not contest statements of merger or request a continuance \r\n  following the substitution and was represented by the same lawyers. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in substituting Waste Management for USA Waste Services in the \r\n  case.(13) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management next argues the \r\n  trial court erred in instructing the jury that a violation of federal Occupational \r\n  Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) regulations constituted negligence \r\n  per se. We agree.   \r\n\r\nAt trial, Waste Management objected \r\n  to a jury charge that read: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[T]he federal Occupational Safety \r\n  and Health Administration has adopted regulations that require employers to \r\n  warn employees and others of potential hazards by posting signs. If you believe \r\n  from the evidence that this regulation was violated by Waste Management, you \r\n  may consider this violation as evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management contends the jury \r\n  charge was inappropriate because it was not Bryant's employer. In other words, \r\n  Waste Management maintains OSHA only establishes a standard of care between \r\n  an employer and its employees and not any standard of care between an employer \r\n  and third parties.  \r\n   \r\nRecently, in Duncan v. CRS Sirrine \r\n  Engineers, Inc.,(14) this court held OSHA \r\n  standards may not be used to impose liability on a third-party contractor. \"OSHA \r\n  standards protect employees working for any business qualifying as an employer \r\n  under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\"(15) \r\n  To determine whether a party is an employer under the act, we must ascertain \r\n  whether the party has a right to control the employee's work.(16) \r\n  Here, Waste Management had no right to control Bryant's work and was thus not \r\n  his employer. It was error, then, to charge the jury that Waste Management's \r\n  failure to comply with the OSHA regulation was negligence per se. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management, however, has not \r\n  shown it was prejudiced by this error because there existed other bases upon \r\n  which the jury could find it liable.(17) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The \"two issue rule\" states that \r\n  when a case is submitted to the jury on two or more theories and, as here, a \r\n  general verdict is returned, the verdict will be upheld if it is supported by \r\n  at least one theory.(18)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, Bryant asserted six theories \r\n  of negligence in its complaint: (1) providing a waste container that was missing \r\n  a front wheel roller; (2) not maintaining garbage trucks in good mechanical \r\n  condition when it knew or should have known a part was malfunctioning; (3) providing \r\n  a waste container in a defective condition without reasonable and necessary \r\n  warnings; (4) failing to properly train its employee on safe and proper methods \r\n  for hoisting a waste container; (5) failing to warn Bryant that its equipment \r\n  was defective and not working as it was designed and manufactured; and (6) failing \r\n  to use the degree of care and caution a reasonable corporation would have used \r\n  under like circumstances.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Anthony Adams, Waste Management's \r\n  employee, testified that a wheel roller from the container that fell on Bryant's \r\n  foot had been missing since April 1996. Dennis Fincher, an operations supervisor \r\n  at MWWTP, testified he noticed that the wheel roller was still missing from \r\n  the container three or four days before Bryant was injured. Also, Dr. Bradberry \r\n  testified the container fell because it was misaligned and the absence of the \r\n  wheel roller exacerbated the misalignment.\r\n \r\n Because the jury rendered a general \r\n  verdict and could have relied upon any of these allegations of negligence to \r\n  find Waste Management liable and because there is ample evidence supporting \r\n  at least one of these allegations, particularly the allegation regarding the \r\n  missing wheel roller, we cannot say Waste Management was prejudiced by the jury \r\n  charge in issue.  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management asserts further \r\n  error in the court's failure to charge there existed no duty to warn of an open \r\n  and obvious condition.  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Dr. Douglas Bradberry testified \r\n  Waste Management failed to warn Bryant of the hazards associated with hoisted \r\n  containers. He opined two warnings should have been given: first, a warning \r\n  \"[to] stay clear at all times when the container is off the ground,\" and second, \r\n  a warning \"[to] stand clear when the container is off the ground.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management presented testimony, \r\n  however, that Bryant was aware of the harm without this warning because he cautioned \r\n  a co-worker, Ronald Caulder, just prior to the accident to be careful around \r\n  containers that had been hoisted onto the truck. From Caulder's testimony, Waste \r\n  Management concluded the danger was open and obvious to Bryant and it was, therefore, \r\n  entitled to an open and obvious danger charge. Waste Management maintains this \r\n  failure deprived it of the opportunity to defend itself and warrants reversal. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAgain, we find Waste Management suffered \r\n  no prejudice in the court's failure to issue the requested jury charge.(19) \r\n  The jury could have relied upon any number of theories of negligence in finding \r\n  Waste Management liable. Furthermore, not all of the theories of negligence \r\n  Bryant asserted related to the alleged open and obvious condition of the hoisted \r\n  container. To the contrary, the theory regarding the missing roller wheel was \r\n  wholly unrelated to it.  \r\n   \r\nPursuant to the \"two issue rule,\" \r\n  we uphold the trial court's decision not to give the charge.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management next contends the \r\n  trial court erred in admitting evidence of financial data in excess of its stated \r\n  net worth, i.e., assets minus liabilities, for consideration by \r\n  the jury in determining punitive damages. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBryant's expert, Dr. Oliver Wood, \r\n  initially testified that U.S.A. Waste Services had $6.6 billion worth of assets.(20) \r\n  Wood subtracted from that figure U.S.A. Waste Service's liabilities of $ 4 billion \r\n  to arrive at a net worth of $2.628 billion. Wood then testified about changes \r\n  in shareholders' equity, the annual operating revenue and annual operating revenue \r\n  per day of U.S.A. Waste Services, and the net income and net income per day \r\n  of U.S.A. Waste Services. In summarizing his testimony, Wood stated U.S.A. Waste \r\n  Services' net income per day totaled $731,589. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management argues the trial \r\n  court's admitting any testimony beyond that of net worth was error. Although \r\n  a defendant's net worth has been the standard used to prove a corporation's \r\n  ability to pay punitive damages,(21) net worth \r\n  is merely one indicia of a corporation's financial condition.(22) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nOur courts have never limited proof \r\n  of a corporation's ability to pay to evidence of net worth as Waste Management \r\n  would have us do. Thus, we decline to prescribe such a rigid standard because \r\n  net worth alone may not always be illustrative of a corporation's financial \r\n  situation. As other courts addressing the issue have noted, factors regarding \r\n  a party's financial situation beyond that of net worth may be relevant to the \r\n  amount of punitive damages necessary to punish and deter a defendant.(23) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nWe hold the trial court did not err \r\n  in admitting evidence of Waste Management's financial condition beyond that \r\n  of net worth.  \r\n   \r\nV. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaste Management further claims the \r\n  trial court erred in denying its new trial motion because the jury's $1 million \r\n  verdict violated the \"fundamental principles\" underlying punitive damages. We \r\n  disagree. \r\n   \r\n In Gamble, our supreme court \r\n  outlined the factors for courts to consider in assessing the appropriateness \r\n  and due process considerations of a punitive damages award: (1) defendant's \r\n  degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness \r\n  or concealment; (4) existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award \r\n  will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award \r\n  is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from this conduct; (7) defendant's \r\n  ability to pay; and (8) \"other factors\" deemed appropriate.(24) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nHere, the trial judge conducted a \r\n  thorough review pursuant to Gamble and found the jury's award \"fair and \r\n  appropriate if not a little bit low.\" As the court stated regarding punitive \r\n  damages:  \r\n   \r\nThe amount of damages, actual or \r\n  punitive, remains largely within the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by \r\n  the trial judge. We adhere to the precedent that this Court's review is limited. \r\n  The rationale for vesting discretion in the trial court was aptly expressed \r\n  in Lucht v. Youngblood: 'The reasonableness of the verdict was challenged \r\n  before the trial judge and he reduced it. The fact he heard the evidence and \r\n  was more familiar than we with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial gives him, \r\n  we think, a better informed view than we have. This is particularly true when \r\n  the elements of damage are intangibles and the appraisal depends somewhat on \r\n  an observation of the [witnesses] and evaluation of their testimony.' Only when \r\n  the trial court's discretion is abused, amounting to an error of law, does it \r\n  become the duty of this Court to set aside the award.(25) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe trial court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion in refusing to grant a new trial on this basis.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Waste Management contends \r\n  the trial court, in violation of BMW v. Gore,(26) \r\n  erred in permitting Bryant to argue its nationwide business practices. Waste \r\n  Management, however, did not object on this ground during Bryant's argument. \r\n  The issue, therefore, is not preserved for our review.(27) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur. \r\n   \r\n1.  These other \r\n  defendants were dismissed prior to trial. \r\n2.  Rule 25(c) \r\n  is applicable where there is a transfer of interest during the pendency \r\n  of an action, whereas Rule 17 is applicable where there is a transfer of interest \r\n  prior to the commencement of an action. 7C Charles Alan Wright &amp; \r\n  Arthur R.

Pursuant to statutory authority, the court \r\n  awarded Norma Drew a total of nine hundred seven thousand, nine hundred sixty \r\n  two dollars(1). Waffle House appeals. We affirm \r\n  in part and reverse in part. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nNorma Drew began working for Waffle \r\n  House, Inc. (WHI) on June 28, 1978. On March 13, 1993, Drew, a unit manager \r\n  at a Waffle House in Hardeeville, suffered significant injuries to her shoulder \r\n  and arms from a fall she took while trying to restrain a Waffle House sign blowing \r\n  around the restaurant's parking lot during a severe windstorm. Drew immediately \r\n  informed her supervisor, District Manager Jerry Spry, about the accident, and \r\n  traveled to the emergency room of the local hospital for treatment. Eventually, \r\n  Drew was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in her hands and a torn rotator \r\n  cuff in her right shoulder.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDespite her injuries, Drew continued \r\n  to work as the unit manager of the Hardeeville Waffle House for several months, \r\n  often in pain and unable to move her right arm above her head. At the beginning \r\n  of the new year, Drew's doctor recommended she have surgery to repair the torn \r\n  rotator cuff in her shoulder. Accordingly, Drew orally requested a leave of \r\n  absence from WHI on January 3, 1994. Drew made the request through her immediate \r\n  supervisor, Tom Palmer, who had replaced Jerry Spry as district manager. Palmer \r\n  orally approved the request. In addition, a few days later Drew discussed her \r\n  situation with Division Manager Tony Langdale, Palmer's boss, and Regional Manager \r\n  Steve Clausen, both of whom encouraged her to have the surgery.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDrew's last day of work before taking \r\n  leave was January 15. On January 16, she underwent the surgery on her shoulder. \r\n  Around the first of February, Drew received a letter from Steve Clausen mentioning \r\n  the \"Federal Leave Act\" and allegedly informing Drew that her FMLA leave would \r\n  be \"effective for a maximum of twelve weeks.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThroughout the next few weeks, Drew \r\n  occasionally dropped by her store to check on her employees. On April 1, while \r\n  visiting the unit, Drew told Tom Palmer she was ready to come back to work but \r\n  had not received a release from her physician. She further informed Palmer she \r\n  had a doctor's appointment on April 19 and felt she would get the release at \r\n  that time. Palmer, in turn, assured Drew everything was fine. \r\nOn April 19, Drew saw her doctor \r\n  and obtained a release for the following week. When Drew attempted to return \r\n  to work on April 25, however, Palmer informed her she no longer had a job. WHI's \r\n  stated reason for the dismissal was excessive absenteeism.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDrew filed a complaint against Waffle \r\n  House on February 24, 1995, alleging retaliatory discharge and breach of an \r\n  implied contract for employment. Drew amended the complaint, adding a cause \r\n  of action for wrongful termination in violation of the Family and Medical Leave \r\n  Act of 1993 (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2601 et. seq. (1994) At a pre-trial \r\n  conference, Drew voluntarily withdrew her claim for retaliatory discharge.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, the court submitted to \r\n  the jury the implied breach of contract claim and a special interrogatory to \r\n  determine if WHI interfered with Drew's rights under the FMLA, but denied WHI's \r\n  motion for a pre-verdict election of remedies. The jury returned a verdict in \r\n  favor of Drew, awarding $600,000.00 in actual damages. In answering the special \r\n  interrogatory, the jury also found Waffle House liable for interfering with \r\n  Drew's rights under the FMLA.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWHI filed timely motions for J.N.O.V. \r\n  and, alternatively, new trial absolute. WHI also renewed its motion for an election \r\n  of remedies. As required, Drew elected to pursue her remedy under the FMLA, \r\n  and filed a motion asking the court to assess and award actual damages, liquidated \r\n  damages, attorney's fees, costs, and prejudgment interest accordingly. On February \r\n  18, 1998, the trial court issued an order denying WHI's motions and awarding \r\n  Drew the following: as to the FMLA cause of action, the court awarded $103,273.00 \r\n  in actual damages, prejudgment interest in the amount of $32,756.90, future \r\n  damages or front pay of $304,845.69, and $440,875.59 in liquidated damages. \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Violation of FMLA \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWHI first argues the trial court \r\n  erred in denying its motion for J.N.O.V., because its termination of Drew for \r\n  failure to return to work was lawful. We disagree. \r\nThe FMLA guarantees an eligible employee \r\n  up to twelve weeks of leave for a \"serious health condition\" rendering the employee \r\n  unable to perform his normal job duties. 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2612(a)(1)(D). In the employer's \r\n  discretion, such leave may be paid or unpaid. Id. at Â§ 2612(d)(1). With \r\n  certain limited exceptions not applicable to the case before us, an employee \r\n  who takes leave pursuant to the Act and returns to work is entitled to restoration \r\n  in the same position held before the leave commenced, or alternatively, must \r\n  be given an equivalent position with equal benefits, pay, and other terms and \r\n  conditions of employment. Id. at Â§ 2614(a)(1). Specifically, the FMLA \r\n  prohibits an employer's interference with an employee's exercise of any right \r\n  prescribed therein. Id. at Â§ 2615(a)(1). An employer who violates an \r\n  employee's rights under the FMLA is liable to the employee for damages, both \r\n  actual and liquidated, attorney's fees, and costs. Id. at Â§ 2617(a)(1) \r\n  &amp; (3).  \r\n   \r\nWHI admits it orally granted Drew \r\n  a leave of absence beginning January 16, 1994. On January 27, however, WHI Regional \r\n  Manager Steve Clausen wrote the following letter to Drew, in relevant part: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs per our conversation of 1-27-94, \r\n  you have requested a medical leave of absence with your effective date 1-13-94. \r\n  Waffle House, Inc. will compensate you for a maximum of six weeks based on your \r\n  last year's income. Your weekly gross compensation will be $642.00.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the Federal Leave Act, your \r\n  leave will be effective for a maximum of twelve weeks.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDrew testified she received this \r\n  letter on or about February 1, and the trial court determined receipt was no \r\n  earlier than January 31. WHI claimed at trial that the letter represented a \r\n  permissible designation of FMLA leave retroactive to January 16. \r\nBy statute, an employer may require \r\n  an employee to substitute accrued paid leave for any FMLA leave provided pursuant \r\n  to an employee's serious medical needs, see 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2612(d)(2)(B), \r\n  and it is undisputed Drew's leave was compensated by WHI for the first six weeks. \r\n  Drew, therefore, was entitled to an additional six weeks of leave under the \r\n  statutory provisions of the FMLA. Id. However, because the statute itself \r\n  does not define the parameters of an employer's \"designation\" of FMLA leave, \r\n  the regulations authorized by the Act and promulgated by the Secretary of Labor \r\n  are controlling. See id. at Â§ 2654; Manuel v. Westlake Polymers \r\n  Corp., 66 F.3d 758 (5th Cir. 1995) (stating regulations of the \r\n  Labor Secretary carry the force of law unless plainly contrary to statutory \r\n  provisions). Thus, any violation of the regulations is actionable as a violation \r\n  of the Act. See Bryant v. Delbar Products, 18 F. Supp. 2d 799 \r\n  (M.D. Tenn. 1998). The Labor Secretary's \"interim final rule\" governing the \r\n  FMLA took effect on August 5, 1993, along with the Act itself. Both parties \r\n  agree that at the time the events underlying this action occurred, the \"interim \r\n  final rule\" governed.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe provisions of the Secretary's \r\n  regulations at issue are as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(c) If the employer requires paid \r\n  leave to be substituted for unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under an \r\n  existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, this decision must be made by \r\n  the employer at the time the employee requests or gives notice of the leave, \r\n  or when the employer determines that the leave qualifies as FMLA leave if this \r\n  happens later. The employer's designation must be made before the leave starts, \r\n  or before an extension of the leave is granted, unless the employer does not \r\n  have sufficient information as to the employee's reason for taking the leave \r\n  until after the leave commenced. In no event may an employer designate leave \r\n  as FMLA leave after the leave has ended.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(d) If either the employer or the \r\n  employee designates leave as FMLA leave after leave has begun, such as when \r\n  an employee requests an extension of the paid leave with unpaid FMLA leave, \r\n  the entire or some portion of the paid leave period may be retroactively counted \r\n  as FMLA leave, to the extent that the leave period qualified as FMLA leave. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n58 Fed. Reg. 31,821 (1993) (later \r\n  codified at 29 C.F.R. Â§ 825.208(c) &amp; (d) (1995)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDespite the language of the cited \r\n  regulations, the parties agreed at trial that the test outlined in Viereck \r\n  v. City of Gloucester City, 961 F. Supp. 703 (D. N.J. 1997), would govern \r\n  the notice issue. In Viereck, the district court held that \"[t]he different \r\n  wording [of interim and final regulations] merely offers two different ways \r\n  of setting the same basic requirement: that employers designate leave as FMLA \r\n  leave within a reasonable time of receiving employee notice.\" Id. at \r\n  708. The Viereck court also found five weeks from the employee's request \r\n  for leave to the date the employer designated it as FMLA leave unreasonable \r\n  as a matter of law. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWHI designated Drew's leave as FMLA \r\n  leave on January 31, some twenty-eight days after her request for time off. \r\n  In answering the court's special interrogatory in the affirmative, the jury \r\n  found WHI's delay unreasonable. We see no reason to disturb this finding of \r\n  fact by the jury, particularly in light of WHI's failure to designate Drew's \r\n  leave as FMLA leave before she left the job. WHI had sufficient information \r\n  concerning the reason for Drew's request at the time it was made, and WHI should \r\n  have made its designation accordingly.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWHI further argues that even if its \r\n  FMLA designation was prospective only, it was effective on January 27, the date \r\n  it claims the FMLA letter was mailed. However, without objection, the trial \r\n  court charged the jury on the law found in Viereck, supra, wherein \r\n  the court stated a mailed notice designating FMLA leave was effective when received. \r\n  Viereck, 961 F.Supp. at 707 n.7. Because WHI did not object to the court's \r\n  charge, it has waived its right to allege any error on appeal. See Creech \r\n  v. S. C. Wildlife &amp; Marine Resources Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d \r\n  571 (1997).  \r\n   \r\nBecause the jury found WHI's delay \r\n  in designating Drew's time off as FMLA leave unreasonable, and because the earliest \r\n  Drew's FMLA leave could have commenced was January 31, Drew was within her statutorily-protected \r\n  right to return to her job as unit manager at Waffle House on April 25, the \r\n  eighty-fourth day of her guaranteed twelve-week leave. See Cline v. \r\n  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 294,300 (4th Cir. 1998) (\"[A]lthough \r\n  an employer has the option of requiring an employee to designate vacation or \r\n  other leave as FMLA leave, that option is waived if the employer fails to give \r\n  proper notice of its intentions.\"). The jury did not err in finding WHI violated \r\n  the FMLA in refusing to permit Drew to return to work and subsequently firing \r\n  her for excessive absenteeism.(2)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Bad Faith Determination \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWHI next asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in finding it violated the FMLA in \"bad faith,\" thereby entitling Drew \r\n  to liquidated damages. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn employer who violates the FMLA \r\n  provisions safeguarding an employee's job pursuant to a serious medical condition \r\n  is liable to the employee for actual damages plus interest, and liquidated damages \r\n  as follows: \r\n   \r\n(iii) an additional amount as liquidated \r\n  damages equal to the sum of the amount described in clause (i) [actual damages] \r\n  and the interest described in clause (ii), except that if an employer who has \r\n  violated section 2615 of this title proves to the satisfaction of the court \r\n  that the act or omission which violated section 2615 of this title was in good \r\n  faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act \r\n  or omission was not a violation of section 2615 of this title, such court may, \r\n  in the discretion of the court, reduce the amount of the liability to the amount \r\n  and interest determined under clauses (i) and (ii), respectively . . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n29 U.S.C. Â§ 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii). To \r\n  avoid a trial court's imposition of liquidated damages, therefore, an employer \r\n  must prove either good faith or reasonable grounds for believing the employee's \r\n  termination did not violate the Act. Even then, by the very terms of the Act \r\n  itself, such reduction remains discretionary with the trial court.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur standard of review on this issue, \r\n  liquidated damages, is at law. Where a law case is decided by a judge alone, \r\n  we will review findings of fact only for any evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the trial court's determination. See Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is evidence in the record to \r\n  reasonably support the trial court's conclusion that WHI failed to demonstrate \r\n  good faith or a reasonable belief that it was not violating the FMLA when it \r\n  dismissed Drew for failing to return to work before April 25. By all accounts, \r\n  Drew was a model employee. More specifically, Drew testified she refused to \r\n  agree to the shoulder surgery before securing approval for a leave of absence \r\n  from her WHI superiors, and the evidence is uncontroverted that Drew obtained \r\n  oral approval for her leave of absence from Tom Palmer; Palmer, the district \r\n  manager at the time and Drew's immediate supervisor, clearly possessed the authority \r\n  to grant Drew time off for an illness or injury. In addition, it is undisputed \r\n  WHI's upper management knew why Drew would be out of work.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurther, Palmer verbally assured \r\n  Drew on April 1, and again on the 19th, that she could return to \r\n  work on April 25. In his deposition testimony, Palmer acknowledged his superiors \r\n  knew about Drew's request for an extension of her medical leave and voiced no \r\n  objections. Tony Langdale, a division manager and Palmer's boss at the time, \r\n  also testified at trial that it was reasonable for Drew to rely on what her \r\n  supervisor (Palmer) said about extending the leave. No one on the WHI management \r\n  team ever told Drew her job was at risk. On this record, WHI's refusal to grant \r\n  Drew a discretionary leave pursuant to its own policies and procedures manual \r\n  or, alternatively, her own accrued vacation time, warrants the trial court's \r\n  findings. In our view, therefore, the trial court did not err in imposing liquidated \r\n  damages on WHI under the FMLA. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Front Pay Award \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWHI claims Drew's front pay award \r\n  was improper(3). We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"Front pay, as an alternative or \r\n  complement to reinstatement, is an equitable remedy\" available under the FMLA. \r\n  Cline v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 294, 307 (4th Cir. \r\n  1998). \"The infinite variety of factual circumstances that can be anticipated \r\n  do not render any remedy of front pay susceptible to legal standards for awarding \r\n  damages.\" Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., 928 F.2d 1413, 1424 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1991). Because of the potential for windfall, the use of front pay as a \r\n  remedy must be tempered. Id. at 1423. See Cline, supra \r\n  (in FMLA case, referring district court to Duke discussion of front pay). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nWe find the award of nineteen years \r\n  of front pay is highly speculative and unsupported by the record. Drew testified \r\n  that she \"would probably still be\" working for WHI as of trial, and that she \r\n  \"guess[ed]\" she would work until age 65. Using our standard of review in equity, \r\n  which allows us to find facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence, we find a more appropriate award is four years of front pay. \r\n  The order of the trial court is therefore modified to award Drew $84,251.80 \r\n  in future damages.  \r\n   \r\nIV. Liquidated Damages \r\n  - Front Pay \r\n   \r\nWHI also claims the trial court erred \r\n  in including Drew's front pay award in its liquidated damages calculation.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe FMLA provides that an employer \r\n  who wrongfully terminates an FMLA-eligible employee is liable to the employee \r\n  for liquidated damages in an amount equal to the sum of actual damages plus \r\n  interest. See 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2617 (a)(1)(A)(iii). The relevant subsections \r\n  describing damages and interest proclaim, respectively: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) Liability\r\nAny employer who violates section \r\n  2615 of this title shall be liable to any eligible employee affected - \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(A) for damages equal to- \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(i)(I) any wages, salary, employment \r\n  benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of \r\n  the violation . . . ; \r\n   \r\n(ii) the interest on the amount described \r\n  in clause (i) calculated at the prevailing rate; and \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(iii) an additional amount as liquidated \r\n  damages equal to the sum of the amount described in clause (i) and the interest \r\n  described in clause (ii) . . . ; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(B) for such equitable relief as \r\n  may be appropriate, including employment, reinstatement and promotion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n29 USC Â§ 2617(a)(1)(A)-(B). Citing \r\n  Cline, WHI contends front pay under the FMLA is an equitable remedy not \r\n  subject to doubling under the Act's liquidated damages provision. We agree. \r\n  As stated above, we find front pay is awarded by the court sitting in equity. \r\n  See Bryant, supra (court will decide the equitable issue \r\n  of front pay); Souders v. Fleming Companies, 960 F. Supp. 218 (D. Neb. \r\n  1997) (front pay is an equitable issue). Therefore, it is not included under \r\n  the Act's liquidated damages provision. The lower court's order is modified \r\n  to award Drew liquidated damages of $136,029.90.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, the order of the lower \r\n  court is  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED \r\n  IN PART. \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n   \r\n1.  A portion \r\n  of this award was vacated and dismissed by agreement of the parties. \r\n2.  Moreover, \r\n  since WHI did not notify Drew that her accrued vacation time was included in \r\n  the twelve weeks, she should have been entitled to that time as additional leave. \r\n  See Cline, 144 F.3d at 301 (where employer failed to designate \r\n  employee's vacation time as FMLA leave, employer's termination of employee within \r\n  the period of time including employee's accumulated vacation time violated the \r\n  FMLA). \r\n3.  WHI asserts \r\n  the trial court should have considered reinstatement of Drew in her previous \r\n  WHI management position as an alternative to its front pay award. The evidence \r\n  shows, however, that such relief was neither sought by Drew nor argued by WHI \r\n  to the court below. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3191","title":"Wells v.

Barbara Wells appeals, \r\n  arguing the trial court erred in charging the jury. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn May 12, 1992, Barbara Wells was \r\n  found at home unable to walk or speak. She was transported immediately to Conway \r\n  Hospital Emergency Room where Dr. Debra Lister performed a full examination \r\n  and evaluation. Hospital records indicate Wells stated that she had slurred \r\n  speech and that \"she knew what she wanted to say but could not say it.\" After \r\n  Wells reported to a nurse that she was experiencing a severe frontal headache, \r\n  Lister diagnosed Wells's symptoms as a probable \"hyperglycemic episode\" and \r\n  Wells returned home.(1) Lister further claims \r\n  she ordered a CT scan but Wells said she did not want to be admitted to the \r\n  hospital and would follow up with her family physician. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe next day, still experiencing \r\n  difficulty talking and ambulating, Wells went to see Dr. Jeanne Halyard, her \r\n  family doctor at Healthcare Partners of South Carolina. Halyard allegedly stated \r\n  that she could not find anything wrong with Wells and that Wells's problems \r\n  were \"in her head.\" In any event, Halyard ordered a refill of Wells's prescription \r\n  for Ativan, an anti-anxiety drug. On May 14, Wells returned to Halyard because \r\n  her symptoms remained unabated. Halyard admits her office records indicate Wells \r\n  reported difficulties speaking and collecting her thoughts and occasionally \r\n  missed words in her speech pattern. Halyard, however, asserts Wells left the \r\n  office before Halyard examined her. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe following day Wells's sister-in-law, \r\n  Rhonda Moore, telephoned Halyard's office to report Wells's continued problems \r\n  with speech, inability to control her right arm, and difficulty swallowing. \r\n  Halyard asserts that, when Moore called, she was instructed to transport Wells \r\n  to Halyard's office as soon as possible. Concerned about Wells's deteriorating \r\n  condition, however, Moore immediately took her to Conway Hospital. The emergency \r\n  room staff suspected a stroke and ordered a neurological evaluation. The tests \r\n  revealed Wells had suffered an \"acute cerebrovascular accident\" or stroke. On \r\n  May 28, the hospital discharged Wells with a permanent disability resulting \r\n  from the stroke. \r\n   \r\nWells filed this medical malpractice \r\n  action against Halyard, Lister, and Conway Hospital on May 11, 1995, alleging \r\n  the doctors failed to diagnose her impending stroke. On April 15, 1996, the \r\n  trial court, with consent of the parties, dismissed Conway Hospital from the \r\n  suit. Two years later, on February 24, 1998, Wells procured an order permitting \r\n  amendment of her complaint to include Healthcare Partners of South Carolina, \r\n  a charitable corporation employing Halyard at the time of the alleged incidents. \r\n  Wells filed her amended complaint on March 11, 1998. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe case went to trial on November \r\n  30, 1998. On December 4, the jury returned a verdict for defendants. Wells immediately \r\n  moved for a new trial asserting several particular errors in the jury charges. \r\n  The court denied the motion and this appeal followed. \r\n   \r\nA trial court must charge the current \r\n  and correct law. McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. \r\n  301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995). When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, \r\n  an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence \r\n  and issues presented at trial. Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. \r\n  Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999). If the charge is reasonably free \r\n  from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible \r\n  error. Id. at 498, 514 S.E.2d at 575. An alleged error is harmless if \r\n  the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged error \r\n  did not contribute to the verdict. State v. Kerr, 330 S.C. 132, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  212 (Ct. App. 1998); see Waldrup v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \r\n  274 S.C. 344, 263 S.E.2d 652 (1980) (the appellate court must view the jury \r\n  charge as a whole before assigning prejudicial error to a discrete portion of \r\n  the charge). \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWells first argues the trial court \r\n  erred in overemphasizing the various legal immunities of health care providers, \r\n  leading the jury to reach a verdict for respondents. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe mere repetition of a correct \r\n  statement of the law does not constitute per se reversible error. Young v. \r\n  Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 201, 165 S.E.2d 797, 808 (1969) (\"a judgment will not \r\n  be reversed because of repetition in a charge to the jury unless such [repetition] \r\n  is prejudicial and it reasonably appears that the jury was mislead thereby\"); \r\n  Keys v. Winnsboro Granite Co., 72 S.C. 97, 102, 51 S.E. 549, 551 (1905) \r\n  (Where there is no doubt that the charge as a whole correctly states the law, \r\n  the court's \"failure to analyze and connect the numerous requests of the opposing \r\n  counsel on the same subject, and indicate in logical sequence how they modify \r\n  each other, does not afford ground for reversal.\"); see, e.g., Lewis \r\n  v. Emory Univ., 509 S.E.2d 635 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998) (the appellate court \r\n  found charge, repeated on five separate occasions, that jury could not guess \r\n  or speculate to reach a conclusion in the medical malpractice case, was not \r\n  reversible error in the context of the entire charge). But see, e.g., \r\n  Hunnicutt v. Griffin, 332 S.E.2d 525 (N.C. Ct. App. 1985) (the appellate \r\n  court found charge was erroneously repeated where the trial court instructed \r\n  the jury six times that negligence cannot be presumed from the mere fact of \r\n  injury). \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the trial court's repetitions \r\n  were generally correct statements of the current state law. See McCourt, \r\n  318 S.C. at 308, 457 S.E.2d at 607 (the appellate court found no error where \r\n  \"the instructions as a whole clearly intimate that a mere mistake in diagnosis \r\n  or error in judgment alone is insufficient to support a finding of malpractice\"); \r\n  Delk v. Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co., 180 S.C. 436, 443, 186 S.E. \r\n  383, 386 (1936) (\"A plaintiff must prove negligence affirmatively.\"); Wall \r\n  v. Suits, 318 S.C. 377, 382-83, 458 S.E.2d 43, 46 (Ct. App. 1995) (where \r\n  the trial court instructed the jury that \"[w]hen a physician undertakes to treat \r\n  a patient, the law does not require absolute accuracy either in his practice \r\n  or his judgment nor does the law hold a physician to the standard of infallibility,\" \r\n  the appellate court found no error and concluded \"the charge in its entirety \r\n  indicates a mistaken diagnosis alone is insufficient to support a finding of \r\n  malpractice\"). While the trial court may have repeated certain charges, the \r\n  trial court never misstated the law. Furthermore, any repetition was harmless \r\n  because the jury charge as a whole was not misleading. We, therefore, conclude \r\n  Wells was not prejudiced such that the jury's verdict should be reversed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWells also argues the trial court \r\n  erred in charging the jury, \"There is absolutely no restriction on lawsuits. \r\n  Anybody can sue anyone, at any time, for anything,\" thereby implying Wells's \r\n  suit was frivolous. We find no merit to this argument. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile we agree that this discussion \r\n  potentially could mislead the jury if taken out of context, the trial court \r\n  was merely introducing the concept of burden of proof and the elements of negligence \r\n  Wells was required to prove. Moreover, immediately prior to this discussion, \r\n  the trial court stated: \r\n   \r\nSo, Madame Forelady, if I should \r\n  intimate in any way where I believe the truth to lie as between the Plaintiff \r\n  and the Defendant, then you disregard it, for it's unintentional on my part. \r\n  That's your providence [sic] and yours alone, and I wouldn't intentionally invade \r\n  your providence [sic]. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court, therefore, avoided \r\n  any potential prejudice. Considering the charge as a whole, we find no reversible \r\n  error. \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWells argues the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to charge the standard of care applicable to her. Our review of the \r\n  record, however, reveals no evidence that Wells ever asked the trial court to \r\n  give this particular charge. Although Wells objected to the failure to give \r\n  such a charge after the trial court concluded its charge to the jury, she points \r\n  to nothing showing she ever asked for it prior to the jury charge. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the record does not \r\n  contain any proposed jury charges regarding a plaintiff's standard of care. \r\n  In her reply brief, Wells claims her \"Request to Charge Number 32,\" which the \r\n  trial court refused to give and to which she objected, encompasses this issue. \r\n  This charge is a comparative negligence charge taken from Davenport v. Cotton \r\n  Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 325 S.C. 507, 482 S.E.2d 569 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997), aff'd as modified, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998). \r\n  The charge deals with assumption of the risk rather than a plaintiff's standard \r\n  of care. \r\n   \r\nSince Wells failed to request this \r\n  particular charge prior to the charges being given and since she failed to include \r\n  the proposed charge in the record, this issue is not preserved. See Greenville \r\n  Mem'l Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 391 S.E.2d 546 (1990) (the appellate \r\n  court will not review the failure to give a requested jury charge where the \r\n  request to charge does not appear on the record); Kline Iron &amp; Steel \r\n  Co. v. Superior Trucking Co., 261 S.C. 542, 201 S.E.2d 388 (1973) (the appellate \r\n  court cannot review trial court's refusal to give requested charge where appellant \r\n  fails to include requested charge in the record); Wren v. Kirkland Distrib. \r\n  Co., 250 S.C. 178, 156 S.E.2d 865 (1967) (the appellate court will not review \r\n  trial court's failure to give requested charge where the contents of the charge \r\n  do not appear in the record). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIV. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWells finally argues the trial court \r\n  erred in charging the jury because the jury charges, as a whole, \"were so slanted \r\n  that any reasonable person would be swayed towards the defense.\" Wells specifically \r\n  asserts that the cumulative effect of the errors in the jury charges justifies \r\n  a new trial in this case. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe initially address whether this \r\n  issue is preserved. Wells made a motion for a new trial asserting several errors \r\n  regarding the jury charges: (1) the trial court failed to charge particular \r\n  instructions requested; (2) the trial court failed to charge Wells's standard \r\n  of care; (3) the trial court overemphasized the standard that the occurrence \r\n  of an injury is not enough to find medical malpractice; (4) the trial court \r\n  repeated the \"infallible standard\" charge; and (5) the trial court erred in \r\n  charging \"anyone can file a lawsuit.\" Wells objected to each of these errors \r\n  separately during the charge and recharge, and she objected to the errors as \r\n  a whole during the motion for a new trial. We, therefore, conclude this issue \r\n  is preserved for our review. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWells cites State v. Freeman, \r\n  319 S.C. 110, 459 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1995), for the proposition that while \r\n  each error raised alone may be insufficient to warrant a new trial, the cumulative \r\n  effect of those errors is enough to require a new trial. We can find no civil \r\n  cases, however, where the appellate courts of our state have reversed a jury \r\n  verdict and ordered a new trial based on the cumulative effect of errors. Although \r\n  our state supreme court briefly addressed a similar argument in Cock-N-Bull \r\n  Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Insurance Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 \r\n  (1996), the court concluded no new trial was warranted because the trial court \r\n  did not commit any of the underlying alleged errors. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, we have found no reversible \r\n  error with respect to each of the errors asserted on appeal. Considering the \r\n  charge as a whole, we conclude the trial court fairly instructed the jury regarding \r\n  the law in medical malpractice cases. See Roberts v. Hunter, 310 \r\n  S.C. 364, 426 S.E.2d 797 (1993) (where appellant contends the trial court's \r\n  jury charge erroneously overemphasized the limitations on the defendant's liabilities \r\n  and was unduly exculpatory and favorable to the defendants, the appellate court \r\n  determined the charge as a whole correctly stated the applicable law of medical \r\n  malpractice and concluded there was no error). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.

Buckner appeals, arguing the trial court \r\n  erroneously charged the law on the crime of unlawful use of the telephone. We \r\n  reverse and remand.  \r\n   \r\nThe charges in this case arose from \r\n  a dispute between Deidre Carter, a deputy sheriff with the Greenville County \r\n  Sheriff's Department, and Buckner. Buckner and Carter had known each other when \r\n  both played on the same basketball team at the YWCA. Buckner's and Carter's \r\n  dislike for each other arose when Carter started dating Nancy Johnson, a woman \r\n  Buckner had previously dated for five years. Johnson and Buckner remained friends, \r\n  however, while Carter and Johnson dated. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn March 27, 1997, two sheriff's \r\n  deputies pulled over Buckner's car in an effort to arrest her for driving while \r\n  under suspension (DUS). Buckner was still on probation for an earlier DUS conviction. \r\n  The driver of the car, however, was not Buckner but rather her roommate, Sharia \r\n  Clinkscales. Clinkscales informed Buckner of the incident.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBetween eleven o'clock and twelve \r\n  noon on that same day, the following telephone call was left on Carter's answering \r\n  machine:  \r\n   \r\nYou know what you little insecure \r\n  son-of-a-bitch. You are so fucking worried about me that you can't fucking sleep \r\n  at (inaudible) night. But you know what, it's on now. You are trying to cause \r\n  more problems for me, okay. You told my probation officer that shit that I'm \r\n  still driving. If I'm still driving, to stop me, have somebody stop me if you \r\n  see me. Because you know what, I hope when you and that little bastard motherfucking \r\n  child of yours eat tonight, I hope you motherfuckers is poisoned, I hope you \r\n  fucking die, bitch. \r\n   \r\nCarter turned the tape over to the \r\n  police, who arrested Buckner for unlawful use of the telephone, a felony punishable \r\n  by up to ten years imprisonment. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Buckner contended a friend \r\n  of hers named Regina actually placed the call. Several witnesses testified, \r\n  however, that it was Buckner's voice on the answering machine tape. The jury \r\n  found Buckner guilty and she was sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended \r\n  on service of 90 days and two years probation. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLEGAL ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn June 1999 Buckner's appellate \r\n  counsel filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 \r\n  (1967), asking to be relieved as counsel. The only issue briefed was whether \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to grant Buckner's motion for a directed verdict \r\n  at the close of the State's case. On December 8, 1999, this court ordered the \r\n  parties to brief the following issue: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhether the trial court's instructions \r\n  to the jury, which included definitions of \"lewd,\" \"lascivious,\" \"indecent,\" \r\n  \"vulgar,\" and \"immoral\" were proper in light of State v. Brown, 274 S.C. \r\n  506, 266 S.E.2d 64 (1980). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Brown, our supreme court \r\n  addressed the constitutionality of South Carolina Code section 16-17-430(A)(1). \r\n  In ruling the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, the court \r\n  narrowly construed the statute to prohibit \"only calls initiated by one with \r\n  the intent and sole purpose of conveying an unsolicited obscene, imminently \r\n  threatening and/or harassing message to an unwilling recipient.\" Brown, \r\n  274 S.C. at 508, 266 S.E.2d at 65.(1)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen instructing the jury, the trial \r\n  court charged the following: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . The defendant is charged in \r\n  the bill of indictment with unlawful use of telephone . . . . [The statute] \r\n  reads in pertinent part as follows: It is unlawful for a person to use in a \r\n  telephonic communication any words or language of a profane, vulgar, lewd, lascivious, \r\n  or an indecent nature, or to threaten in a telephonic communication any unlawful \r\n  act with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass another person, or to communicate \r\n  or convey by telephone an obscene, vulgar, indecent, profane, suggestive, or \r\n  immoral message to another person. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn order to find the defendant guilty \r\n  of unlawful use of the telephone you must find that the State . . . proved . \r\n  . . that the defendant herself made a phone call with the intent and sole purpose \r\n  of conveying an unsolicited, obscene, imminently threatening and/or harassing \r\n  message to an unwilling [recipient]. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe judge then proceeded to define \r\n  the terms within the statute as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI charge you, the word lascivious \r\n  means tending to excite lust, lewd, indecent, obscene, sexual impurity, tending \r\n  to deprave morals in respect to sexual relations . . . [and] that the word lewd \r\n  means obscene, lustful, indecent, lecherous. The term imports a lascivious intent. \r\n  It signifies that form of immorality which has relation to moral impurity . \r\n  . . .  \r\n   \r\nI charge you profanity is defined \r\n  as irreverence towards sacred things, particular[ly] an irreverent or blasphemous \r\n  use of the name of God, vulgar, irreverent or course language.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI charge you that the term indecent \r\n  means offensive to common propriety, offending against modesty or delicacy, \r\n  grossly vulgar, obscene, lewd, unseemingly becoming or unfit to be heard. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI charge you indecent means such \r\n  as are - indecent publications means such as are offensive to modesty and delicacy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI charge you the term vulgar means \r\n  lack of cultivation or refinement. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI charge you immoral means contrary \r\n  to good morals or inconsistent with the rules and principles of morality. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter excusing the jury, the trial \r\n  court asked if there were any objections to the jury charge. Counsel for Buckner \r\n  stated that she believed the South Carolina Supreme Court had limited the language \r\n  of the statute and that the charge as given to the jury was erroneous. The State \r\n  responded that it thought the judge had charged the correct and current law. \r\n  The trial court agreed, stating, \"I think it was an appropriate charge. I deny \r\n  the motion.\" \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge is required to charge \r\n  the current and correct law of South Carolina. State v. Foust, 325 S.C. \r\n  12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996). Jury instructions should be considered as a whole, \r\n  and if as a whole they are free from error, any isolated portions which may \r\n  be misleading do not constitute reversible error. State v. Sims, 304 \r\n  S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991). The substance of the law is what must be instructed \r\n  to the jury, not any particular verbiage. State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, \r\n  272 S.E.2d 634 (1980).  \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, the trial judge \r\n  not only charged the statute but defined all of the statutory terms. In light \r\n  of the supreme court's opinion in State v. Brown, the trial court erroneously \r\n  charged the law on the offense of unlawful use of the telephone. \r\nWhile we note that the charge contained \r\n  both the correct and incorrect law as it relates to the crime of unlawful use \r\n  of a telephone, we do not find the error to be harmless.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhere the charge contains both the \r\n  correct and incorrect law, an appellate court must assume the jury followed \r\n  the incorrect charge. State v. Taylor, 323 S.C. 162, 473 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (citing People v. Hess, 543 N.W.2d 332 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995)). \r\n  Moreover, in determining whether the error was harmless, we must determine beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict. \r\n  State v. Andrews, 324 S.C. 516, 479 S.E.2d 808 (Ct. App. 1996). We must \r\n  review the facts the jury heard and weigh those facts against the erroneous \r\n  jury charge to determine what effect, if any, it had on the verdict. State \r\n  v. Jefferies, 316 S.C. 13, 446 S.E.2d 427 (1994). In making a harmless error \r\n  analysis, our inquiry is not what the verdict would have been had the jury been \r\n  given the correct charge, but whether the erroneous charge contributed to the \r\n  verdict rendered. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen examining the facts of this \r\n  case, we find the erroneous charge contributed to the verdict. In reviewing \r\n  the telephone call, it is clear that the telephone call contained vulgar, profane, \r\n  indecent, and immoral language as defined by the trial judge. In order to be \r\n  convicted under the statute, however, the telephone call must be made with the \r\n  intent and sole purpose of conveying an unsolicited obscene or imminently threatening \r\n  message or made to harass the recipient. When reviewing the jury charge, it \r\n  is clear that the trial judge lowered the burden necessary for the jury to find \r\n  Buckner guilty, as under his charge, the phone call only had to contain one \r\n  \"indecent\" or \"immoral\" word for the jury to convict Buckner. Accordingly, we \r\n  reverse Buckner's conviction and remand for a new trial.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  Without the \r\n  limiting instruction the statute is vague and overbroad, as the words vulgar, \r\n  profane, immoral, and indecent are all substantially overbroad. See Walker \r\n  v. Dillard, 523 F.2d 3 (4th Cir. 1975) (holding that absent limiting construction \r\n  of statute proscribing vulgar or profane language, statute was unconstitutional \r\n  because it was facially and substantially overbroad); Radford v. Webb, \r\n  446 F.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nOn August 19, 1992, at about 1:30 \r\n  p.m., Waring and Johnson were involved in an automobile accident on Highway \r\n  17, at that time a two lane highway, near an area called Pocataligo. Waring, \r\n  who was sixty-four years old at the time, was a passenger in a motor home which \r\n  Johnson struck from behind in his truck.\r\nWaring testified she and her then-husband \r\n  (the couple is now divorced) were in the second day of a one month trip when \r\n  they were forced to slow down because a car ahead of them was driving with a \r\n  flat tire. They were waiting for oncoming traffic to clear so they could pass \r\n  when they were suddenly, and without warning, struck from behind. The front \r\n  left side of the truck crashed into the right rear portion of the motor home \r\n  with such an impact that a stove or refrigerator which was installed inside \r\n  the motor home flew over the top of the truck. The highway patrolman who responded \r\n  to the scene stated that when he arrived, debris from the motor home was scattered \r\n  two hundred feet up and down the highway. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe highway on which Waring and Johnson \r\n  were traveling was straight and had no visual obstructions. According to Johnson, \r\n  it was raining hard at the time of the accident and, although he had slowed \r\n  to 45 miles per hour, the rain on the road made it impossible for him to avoid \r\n  striking the motor home. Waring, however, did not recall it raining very hard. \r\n  Waring declared she had no difficulty seeing the slowed vehicles ahead and her \r\n  husband had no difficulty in slowing down while waiting for an opportunity to \r\n  pass. \r\n   \r\nThe next morning, Waring felt stiff \r\n  and took Ibuprofen. She and her husband canceled their plans to drive to Maine. \r\n  Instead, they returned to their home in Florida on Saturday, four days after \r\n  the accident. By that date, Waring was in agony, in pain throughout her body. \r\n  She could not bear to ride in the vehicle without Ibuprofen. Waring found and \r\n  took some Darvocet she had in a first aid kit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn Monday morning, Waring called \r\n  to make an appointment with her doctor, Dr. Robert Diaz, an orthopedic surgeon. \r\n  She could not get an appointment until August 28, 1992. In the interim period, \r\n  Waring suffered from neck and back pain so severe she could not bend over and \r\n  could only \"lay around and groan.\" Dr. Diaz recalled Waring suffered from muscle \r\n  spasms in her neck and lumbar spine. He opined the spasms were caused by the \r\n  accident. Dr. Diaz prescribed muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory medicine \r\n  and sent Waring to physical therapy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen Dr. Diaz saw Waring less than \r\n  two weeks later, on September 9, he noticed mild muscle spasm in her upper shoulder. \r\n  Her lumbar spine spasm had become moderate to marked with a loss in her range \r\n  of motion. At her next visit on September 18, Waring had improved with physical \r\n  therapy but was still suffering pain in her shoulder. She experienced even more \r\n  improvement by her next visit on September 30, although she still had spasms \r\n  in her lumbar spine and upper shoulders. By early November, Waring had improved \r\n  to the point that she was able to swim and fish. Yet, she still experienced \r\n  tightness in her neck while sitting and reading. At a visit approximately three \r\n  weeks later, she reported she was no longer improving with physical therapy \r\n  and medicine. Additionally, she complained of neck pain and occasional arm pain \r\n  while reaching. An examination revealed her range of motion in her neck and \r\n  lumbar spine was restricted. As of her December 4, 1992 visit, Waring's main \r\n  symptoms involved her neck, but she had less spasms and her range of motion \r\n  was good. Dr. Diaz advised Waring to increase her activities and perform exercises \r\n  at home. \r\n   \r\nOn January 6, 1993, Dr. Diaz examined \r\n  Waring when she experienced a recurrence of lower back discomfort brought on \r\n  by lifting a holiday turkey on December 22, 1992. She noticed the pain immediately \r\n  and it remained until her visit to the doctor. Dr. Diaz checked Waring's lumbar \r\n  spine and reported the highest spasm and pain ratings to date. Her range of \r\n  motion was minimal. Dr. Diaz ordered an MRI and a bone scan. Waring's bone scan \r\n  was normal, but her MRI showed extensive degenerative disc disease and spinal \r\n  stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal. According to Dr. Diaz, the \r\n  cause of Waring's back complaints on that date \"was a continuing problem from \r\n  her motor vehicle accident that had probably aggravated an already present spinal \r\n  stenosis.\" In addition, she suffered neck complaints which the doctor attributed \r\n  to cervical strain caused by the accident. Dr. Diaz stated he did not believe \r\n  Waring was malingering or faking her symptoms. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn January, Waring began experiencing \r\n  more severe back problems, which affected her control over her legs, bowel, \r\n  and bladder. Because of her increasing difficulties and Dr. Diaz's reluctance \r\n  to engage in any different course of treatment, Waring decided to see a neurosurgeon. \r\n  She spoke to one of her neighbors, who recommended she seek the assistance of \r\n  Dr. Glenn Kindt, a neurosurgeon in Denver, Colorado, who had performed back \r\n  surgery on Waring's neighbor. Dr. Kindt saw Waring four times: (1) on September \r\n  14, 1993, for her initial evaluation in which he reviewed her MRIs and recommended \r\n  surgery; (2) on September 20, 1993, when he performed a laminectomy(1) \r\n  for stenosis and discectomy(2) for a herniated \r\n  disc on Waring; (3) at the follow-up visit on September 28, 1993; and (4) approximately \r\n  two years later on August 21, 1995, when Waring continued to experience burning \r\n  sensations down her right leg after standing for longer than two hours. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen asked the role Waring's accident \r\n  played in her symptoms, Dr. Kindt was hesitant to give an opinion of the role \r\n  of any accident in Waring's condition. However, he stated that if she had been \r\n  in an accident and if her symptoms began at that time, he was quite certain \r\n  the symptoms were related to the accident. Dr. Kindt explained that, while an \r\n  accident could not have created the stenosis which required surgery, it could \r\n  have aggravated it. When presented with hypothetical questions matching Waring's \r\n  history, Dr. Kindt opined her stenosis was in fact aggravated by the accident \r\n  and that her herniated disc could have been caused by the accident. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSometime in 1994, after her surgery \r\n  and return to Florida, Waring began experiencing muscle spasms which would sometimes \r\n  last several days. In May of 1994, she visited the Carolina Spine Institute \r\n  in Charleston, South Carolina, where she saw Dr. Steven Poletti for an independent \r\n  medical evaluation of lower back pain. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1995, Waring moved to Seattle, \r\n  Washington. On April 16, 1996, she began seeing Dr. Andrew Friedman, a doctor \r\n  of physical medicine and rehabilitation. At that point, she could not engage \r\n  in her prior hobbies such as fishing or swimming. Her main complaint was back \r\n  pain. Dr. Friedman prescribed Darvocet and arranged for Waring to receive physical \r\n  therapy to reduce her muscular contractures. In August of 1996, Waring returned \r\n  to Dr. Friedman for a check-up because she had \"new symptoms radiating down \r\n  her leg.\" Her foot was becoming increasingly numb. One month later, Dr. Friedman \r\n  gave her a steroid injection to reduce inflammation. He opined Waring's 1992 \r\n  accident most probably caused or contributed to her back and leg pain. Dr. Friedman \r\n  explained that Waring had a pre-existing degenerative arthritic condition which \r\n  the accident probably accelerated or aggravated. He stated Waring's pain would \r\n  be permanent and would require a variety of treatments over the remainder of \r\n  her life, including medication, physical therapy, epidural steroid injections \r\n  and, possibly, surgery. \r\n   \r\nIn October of 1997, Waring returned \r\n  to the Carolina Spine Institute where she was treated by several doctors. Her \r\n  primary complaints were back pain, leg pain, numbness on the top of her foot, \r\n  pain in her right foot, and an inability to move her toes. Waring received epidural \r\n  steroid injections and selective nerve root injections to ease the pain. Dr. \r\n  John Johnson, who treated her at the institute, testified Waring's 1992 accident \r\n  was the initial cause of her back pain and, although she had pre-existing conditions, \r\n  the accident clearly aggravated them, causing her cascading pain requiring surgery \r\n  and years of treatment. Dr. Johnson asserted that, based on the treatment Waring \r\n  received in the past, he would be \"very surprised if there's anything that can \r\n  be done for her\" to make her better. He did, however, refer Waring to a chronic \r\n  pain specialist. \r\n   \r\nIn addition to the pain and surgery \r\n  she endured, Waring's lifestyle was changed by the accident. Prior to this wreck, \r\n  Waring enjoyed traveling long distances, camping, competitive salt water sport \r\n  fishing, golfing, boating, swimming, and gardening. Since the accident, Waring \r\n  has been unable to return to most of these activities. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWaring filed this action against \r\n  Johnson and his father in 1995 seeking recovery for personal injuries suffered \r\n  as a result of the accident. Johnson's father was subsequently dismissed as \r\n  a party. At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury with \r\n  regard to the law of aggravation of a pre-existing injury and the law of damages, \r\n  including past and future medical expenses, as well as physical and mental pain \r\n  and suffering. The jury returned a verdict of $23,237.28, the exact amount of \r\n  Waring's medical bills. Waring moved for a new trial nisi additur \r\n  or, in the alternative, a new trial absolute. The court denied the motion for \r\n  a new trial absolute, but granted the motion for a new trial nisi additur, \r\n  finding: \r\n   \r\n[T]he verdict is not so grossly inadequate \r\n  so as to shock the conscience of the Court nor to indicate that the jury was \r\n  motivated by passion, caprice or prejudice. Rather the verdict is merely inadequate \r\n  because it fails to compensate [Waring] for all of her damages. Since the verdict \r\n  was for the exact amount of the medical bills it is clear that the jury believed \r\n  the medical treatment to be reasonable and necessary. The jury failed to make \r\n  any award for other damages such as pain and suffering. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe court determined: \"[T]his is \r\n  a case appropriate for a new trial nisi additur in the amount \r\n  of $40,000 in addition to the verdict rendered by the jury.\" The court ruled \r\n  that if Johnson did not accept the additur within fifteen days, Waring \r\n  would receive a new trial absolute. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDid the trial court err in granting \r\n  Waring's motion for new trial nisi additur? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nJohnson argues the trial court abused \r\n  its discretion in granting Waring a new trial nisi additur. Specifically, \r\n  he maintains the court (1) failed to consider that the jury's verdict might \r\n  have represented an award of pain and suffering and a portion of Waring's claimed \r\n  medical expenses; (2) failed to consider that the jury might have concluded \r\n  Waring's medical expenses were proximately caused by the accident, but her pain \r\n  and suffering arose solely from her pre-existing condition; and (3) granted \r\n  an excessive additur, if in fact one was warranted. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNew Trial Nisi Additur \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen the jury's verdict is inadequate \r\n  or excessive, the trial judge has the discretionary power to grant a new trial \r\n  nisi. Bailey v. Peacock, 318 S.C. 13, 455 S.E.2d 690 (1995). See \r\n  also McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 \r\n  S.E.2d 603 (1995)(trial judge alone has power to grant new trial nisi \r\n  when he finds amount of verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive). Compelling \r\n  reasons, however, must be given to justify invading the jury's province in this \r\n  manner. Bailey, supra. The grant or denial of a motion for a new \r\n  trial nisi rests within the discretion of the trial judge and his decision \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly unsupported by \r\n  the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law. See \r\n  Krepps by Krepps v. Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 479 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  See also Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996)(grant of motion for new trial nisi is within trial judge's \r\n  discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent abuse of discretion). Yet, \r\n  such discretion is not absolute. Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, \r\n  Inc. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 427 S.E.2d 673 (1993). This Court has the duty \r\n  to review the record and determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion \r\n  amounting to an error of law. Vinson, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA new trial nisi is one in \r\n  which a new trial will be granted unless the party opposing it complies with \r\n  a condition set by the court. Elliott v. Black River Elec. Coop., 233 \r\n  S.C. 233, 104 S.E.2d 357 (1958). When a party moves for a new trial based on \r\n  a challenge that the verdict is either excessive or inadequate, the trial judge \r\n  must distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative \r\n  and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice or prejudice. Allstate Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 431 S.E.2d 557 (1993). If the amount of the \r\n  verdict is so grossly inadequate or excessive that it shocks the conscience \r\n  of the court and clearly indicates the amount was the result of passion, caprice, \r\n  prejudice, partiality, corruption or some other improper motives, the trial \r\n  judge is required to grant a new trial absolute. See Cock-N-Bull Steak \r\n  House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996); Krepps, \r\n  supra. \r\n   \r\nWhile the trial court may not impose \r\n  its will on a party by substituting its judgment for that of the jury, the court \r\n  may give the party an option in the way of additur or, in the alternative, \r\n  a new trial. Vinson, supra. The consideration of a motion for \r\n  a new trial nisi additur requires the court to consider the adequacy \r\n  of the verdict in light of the evidence presented. Krepps, supra. \r\n  A new trial nisi additur may be ordered when the verdict is merely \r\n  insufficient based on the evidence. Pelican, supra. The trial \r\n  judge who heard the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere \r\n  at trial possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this Court. Vinson, \r\n  supra. Accordingly, great deference is given to the trial judge. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe import of a new trial nisi \r\n  additur is a suggestion on the part of the judge of a settlement figure. \r\n  Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984); Estes v. Grav, \r\n  319 S.C. 551, 462 S.E.2d 561 (Ct. App. 1995). If the party opposing the motion \r\n  for a new trial nisi additur later agrees to pay the amount suggested \r\n  by the trial court, the opposing party cannot thereafter complain. Graham, \r\n  supra. The prevailing party having asked for the relief must likewise \r\n  be content with the determination. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe practice of using additur \r\n  is said to be in the interest of sound administration of justice, since it avoids \r\n  the necessity of a new trial with its accompanying expense and delay. 58 Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d New Trial Â§ 584 (1989). The granting of new trials upon the ground \r\n  of inadequacy of damages occurs less frequently than the granting of new trials \r\n  upon the ground of excessive damages, probably because detection of inadequacy \r\n  of damages is not as easy as is detection of excessiveness. 58 Am. Jur. 2d New \r\n  Trial Â§ 403 (1989). Although the motion for a new trial nisi additur \r\n  has not been frequently used, it is true that the trial judge has the authority \r\n  to grant a new trial to the plaintiff unless the defendant agrees to the payment \r\n  of an additional amount. Graham, supra.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAbsent an abuse of discretion, the \r\n  trial court's grant of a motion for new trial nisi additur will \r\n  not be reversed on appeal. See e.g., Graham v. Whitaker, \r\n  282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984)(court did not abuse its discretion in granting \r\n  patient, who had been awarded $10,000 in actual damages and $10,000 in punitive \r\n  damages against ophthalmologist for injuries she sustained in a fall in ophthalmologist's \r\n  office, a new trial nisi on damages unless ophthalmologist agreed to \r\n  an additur of $67,500 in actual damages, where judge stated appropriate \r\n  reasons in his order and it could not be argued that patient was adequately \r\n  compensated by jury verdict); Estes v. Grav, 319 S.C. 551, 462 S.E.2d \r\n  561 (Ct. App. 1995)(affirming trial court's grant of plaintiff's motion for \r\n  new trial nisi additur even where plaintiff claimed on appeal \r\n  that $500 in additional damages was inadequate); Patterson v. Reid, 318 \r\n  S.C. 183, 456 S.E.2d 436 (Ct. App. 1995)(trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in granting motion for new trial nisi additur and increasing damages \r\n  award to motorist injured in automobile accident from $500.54 to $7,639.40 where \r\n  treating physician testified that motorist had fibrosis which was most probably \r\n  result of accident, that she did not believe motorist had psychosomatic problems, \r\n  and that, due to accident, motorist's daily pain increased to eight on scale \r\n  of ten from five, even though conflicting evidence was presented regarding effects \r\n  of, and daily pain level of five prior to accident was caused by, earlier accident \r\n  in which motorist was involved); Kalchthaler v. Workman, 316 S.C. 499, \r\n  503, 450 S.E.2d 621, 623 (Ct. App. 1994)(trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in granting new trial nisi additur in the amount of $2,553.76 \r\n  where the plaintiff's motion specified \"an amount 'up to $15,000'\" and in denying \r\n  motion for new trial absolute where verdict was not so shockingly disproportionate \r\n  to injuries sustained as to indicate some influence outside evidence motivated \r\n  jury's decision); Stroud v. Stroud, 299 S.C. 394, 385 S.E.2d 205 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989)(granting new trial nisi additur of $4000, for a total \r\n  of $8765.17, in personal injury action arising when plaintiff was injured while \r\n  visiting his brother's repair shop was not abuse of discretion, although plaintiff \r\n  did not receive amount he had requested); Thomas v. Seay, 295 S.C. 455, \r\n  369 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 1988)(evidence in record, that plaintiff suffered 10 \r\n  to 15% permanent partial impairment to her cervical spine and incurred medical \r\n  bills totaling almost $2,000 as result of automobile accident, supported grant \r\n  of new trial nisi additur raising jury verdict of $371 in actual \r\n  damages to $7,500); Jones v. Ingles Supermarkets, Inc., 293 S.C. 490, \r\n  361 S.E.2d 775 (Ct. App. 1987), overruled on other grounds by O'Neal \r\n  v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555 (1993) (jury award of $150 in malicious \r\n  prosecution action to compensate plaintiff for attorney fees incurred in defending \r\n  charge of issuing check on closed account was grossly inadequate to compensate \r\n  plaintiff for mental pain and suffering, fright, nervousness, indignity, humiliation, \r\n  embarrassment and insults she was subjected to when arrested in presence of \r\n  her two children and forced to travel to county jail where she was subjected \r\n  to lengthy booking process, including being photographed and then imprisoned \r\n  in cell for four hours or more, and thus court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in granting new trial nisi additur in amount of $7500); Chiappetta v. Orr, \r\n  293 S.C. 250, 359 S.E.2d 530 (Ct. App. 1987)(trial court's grant of vendors' \r\n  motion for new trial nisi unless purchaser agreed to additur of \r\n  $12,500 in damages was not abuse of discretion following jury's award of $2,500 \r\n  damages to vendors against purchaser for breach of contract for sale of home, \r\n  based on purchaser's stopping payment on earnest money check; it was evident \r\n  from record vendors' damages were in range of damages awarded by jury verdict \r\n  and trial judge's additur). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the instant case, the trial court \r\n  did not err in granting a new trial nisi additur. The jury failed \r\n  to consider Waring's pain and suffering in reaching its verdict. Waring visited \r\n  numerous doctors for years after the accident, seeking relief from varying degrees \r\n  of pain and discomfort. She underwent surgery for a condition which numerous \r\n  doctors testified was aggravated by the wreck. Waring took advantage of every \r\n  recommendation of her physicians and, unfortunately, will most likely suffer \r\n  pain for the remainder of her life. In addition to the pain she has and will \r\n  continue to suffer, Waring found herself unable to continue her previous active \r\n  lifestyle. Indubitably, Waring is entitled to an award for pain and suffering. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs to Johnson's claim the jury's \r\n  verdict may have been intended to represent a portion of Waring's medical expenses, \r\n  plus pain and suffering, we find this argument patently untenable. The jury's \r\n  award of exactly the amount of Waring's medical expenses, to the penny, is an \r\n  attempt to reimburse her for those very expenses. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurther, we reject Johnson's argument \r\n  that the jury may have concluded Waring's medical expenses were caused by the \r\n  accident, but that her pain and suffering arose solely from her pre-existing \r\n  condition. Each doctor who testified expressed his opinion that Waring's various \r\n  pains were associated, at least in part, with the accident. Even if the greatest \r\n  portion of Waring's pain was caused by her pre-existing conditions, there is \r\n  no question that the accident aggravated or accelerated those conditions, resulting \r\n  in pain where there previously had been none. See Raino v. Goodyear \r\n  Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 259, 422 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1992)(\"The \r\n  defendant takes the plaintiff as he is found and the plaintiff is entitled to \r\n  recover damages resulting from the aggravation of a pre-existing condition.\"). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nFinally, Johnson claims that even \r\n  if the trial court properly granted additur, the amount awarded for pain \r\n  and suffering was excessive. We disagree. Given the pain Waring has and will \r\n  suffer, and the lifestyle she has lost, the court's additur of $40,000 \r\n  was not excessive. \r\n   \r\nThe Circuit judge articulated compelling \r\n  reasons in his order justifying the grant of the nisi additur. \r\n  The order encapsulates a review of the evidentiary record and the applicable \r\n  law. \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion by granting a new trial nisi additur. Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the Circuit Court granting a new trial nisi additur \r\n  is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n1.

We affirm the trial judge's \r\n  denial of Dr. Paul Carlson's motion to amend his answer to assert the statute \r\n  of repose, and reverse his grant of Carlson's motion to amend to assert the \r\n  statute of limitations and his grant of a directed verdict on that basis. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nFrances Dunbar began seeing Carlson \r\n  in 1983 or 1984. He was her only dentist until 1994. Dunbar saw Carlson many \r\n  times during this period, and on one of her visits he advised her to have all \r\n  of her lower teeth crowned. However, Carlson only cleaned her teeth a couple \r\n  of times during the ten years she was his patient, and he never informed Dunbar \r\n  she was suffering from periodontal disease. During one two-year period, Carlson \r\n  placed Dunbar on twenty regimens of antibiotics due to the infections she was \r\n  having, and her face became badly swollen and painful. Nevertheless, Dunbar \r\n  liked Carlson and never questioned his treatment. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter noticing Dunbar was constantly \r\n  on antibiotics, her daughter, Rose Taylor, accompanied her on her last visit \r\n  to Carlson on June 24, 1994. At that visit, Carlson announced that he had called \r\n  the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston and arranged for Dunbar \r\n  to have all of her teeth extracted. He did not tell her she had periodontal \r\n  disease. Taylor requested her mother's records and Dunbar was subsequently treated \r\n  by Dr. Harold Jablon. Jablon found she had severe periodontal abscesses (infections \r\n  of the teeth) and diagnosed her with \"severe advanced periodontal disease.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDunbar filed this medical malpractice \r\n  action against Carlson on September 26, 1995, alleging he failed to diagnose \r\n  and/or treat her periodontal disease, which ultimately resulted in severe bone \r\n  loss and the extraction of all her teeth. Dunbar averred that in June 1994 she \r\n  first became aware and was informed that she had severe bone loss and periodontal \r\n  disease caused by Carlson's failure to diagnose and/or treat the condition during \r\n  the time she was his regular patient. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Jablon was qualified as \r\n  an expert in dentistry. He testified Dunbar's periodontal disease was the type \r\n  of disease a general dentist would be expected to identify, and that it would \r\n  be the obligation of the general dentist to inform the patient of the condition \r\n  and provide treatment or to refer the patient to a specialist, such as a periodontist. \r\n  He further testified that due to Carlson's failure to treat Dunbar, he ultimately \r\n  had to extract all of her teeth due to severe advanced periodontal disease. \r\n  Jablon found no indication in Carlson's notes that he had recognized this problem. \r\n  He stated Dunbar should have been informed that she had a condition that needed \r\n  treatment. Jablon estimated that when Dunbar came to him in 1994, her condition \r\n  had been progressing for \"six, seven years.\" When Jablon reviewed x-rays Carlson \r\n  had taken of Dunbar, he could see some bone loss in one from September 1987 \r\n  that would indicate the beginning stages of periodontal disease. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRose Taylor, Dunbar's daughter, testified \r\n  that she accompanied her mother on her last visit to Carlson, at which he announced \r\n  he had made arrangements for Dunbar to have all of her teeth extracted at the \r\n  Medical University in Charleston. She stated Carlson still did not inform her \r\n  mother that she had periodontal disease, even at this last visit. On cross-examination, \r\n  defense counsel asked Taylor whether when she first started going with her mother \r\n  to see Carlson she thought anything was wrong. Taylor stated she supported her \r\n  mother's decision, and that her mother had liked Carlson. Taylor then testified \r\n  she had encouraged her mother to leave Carlson's care between 1992 and 1994. \r\n  Upon further questioning from defense counsel, Taylor stated she could not be \r\n  specific but thought she first advised her mother to leave Carlson in early \r\n  1992. Defense counsel stated, \"Like February, March, April?\" and Taylor stated \r\n  that she became \"very concerned\" about her mother around that time. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDunbar rested her case after this \r\n  testimony. Carlson then moved to amend his answer to allege the defenses of \r\n  the statute of repose and statute of limitations and for a directed verdict \r\n  on those grounds. The trial judge denied the motion to amend as to the statute \r\n  of repose. However, the trial judge granted Carlson's motion as to the statute \r\n  of limitations and granted a directed verdict to Carlson on that ground. Both \r\n  parties appeal. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  Dunbar's Appeal \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Statute \r\n  of Limitations  \r\n   \r\nDunbar contends the trial judge erred \r\n  in allowing Carlson to amend his pleadings to assert the affirmative defense \r\n  of the statute of limitations. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter Dunbar rested her case at trial, \r\n  defense counsel argued Carlson should be allowed to amend his pleadings to assert \r\n  the three-year statute of limitations based on Taylor's testimony on cross-examination \r\n  that she first advised her mother to leave Carlson in February, March, or April \r\n  of 1992. Since this action was not filed until September 1995, defense counsel \r\n  contended the three-year statute of limitations had run on Dunbar's claim and \r\n  Carlson was entitled to a directed verdict on this basis. The trial judge agreed \r\n  and allowed Carlson to amend his pleadings to conform to the evidence under \r\n  Rule 15(b), SCRCP, and then granted his motion for a directed verdict based \r\n  on the three-year statute of limitations. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 15-3-545(A) contains the \r\n  statute of limitations governing medical malpractice actions. It provides a \r\n  three-year limitations period for such claims, employing the discovery rule \r\n  for determining the accrual date. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-545(A) (Supp. 1999). \r\n  The three-year statute of limitations begins to run when the facts and circumstances \r\n  of the injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice \r\n  that some right of hers has been invaded or that some claim against a party \r\n  might exist. Johnston v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, 64, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1993). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCarlson did not plead the affirmative \r\n  defense of the statute of limitations in his answer. See Rule 8(c), \r\n  SCRCP. However, Rule 15(b), SCRCP, allows for amendments of pleadings to conform \r\n  to the evidence presented at trial. It provides in pertinent part: \"When issues \r\n  not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, \r\n  they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\" \r\n  Rule 15(b), SCRCP. The decision whether to allow the amendment of pleadings \r\n  to conform to the evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. \r\n  Kelly v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 319, 323, \r\n  450 S.E.2d 59, 61 (Ct. App. 1994). Amendments should be allowed if no prejudice \r\n  occurs to the opposing party. Rule 15(b), SCRCP; Soil &amp; Material Eng'rs, \r\n  Inc. v. Folly Assoc., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nRule 15(b) covers two situations \r\n  involving amendments to conform to the evidence. \"First, if an issue not raised \r\n  by the pleadings is tried by express or implied consent of the parties the court \r\n  may permit amendment of the pleadings to reflect the issue. Second, if a party \r\n  objects to the introduction of evidence as not being within the pleadings the \r\n  court may permit amendment of the pleadings subject to a right to grant a continuance \r\n  if necessary.\" Sunvillas Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. Square D Co., 301 \r\n  S.C. 330, 334, 391 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1990). \"Express consent may be \r\n  demonstrated by a stipulation but implied consent depends on whether the parties \r\n  recognized an issue not raised by the pleadings entered the case during the \r\n  trial.\" Id. at 335, 391 S.E.2d at 871. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, no objection was made \r\n  to the evidence; therefore, the second part of the rule is not applicable. Further, \r\n  there was no express consent. Thus, the question before us is whether the parties \r\n  tried the issue by implied consent. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCarlson asserts Dunbar impliedly \r\n  consented to the amendment based on her failure to object to her daughter's \r\n  testimony. To the contrary, we find the failure to object in this case is evidence \r\n  that Dunbar did not recognize the purpose for which Carlson sought to elicit \r\n  this testimony. Carlson further argues Dunbar cannot claim the amendment prejudiced \r\n  her since she did not object to the testimony. See Woods v. Rabon, \r\n  295 S.C. 343, 348, 368 S.E.2d 471, 474 (Ct. App. 1988). We disagree. The prejudice \r\n  to Dunbar is patent in that the trial judge granted a directed verdict against \r\n  Dunbar immediately after permitting Carlson's amendment. Unaware this was an \r\n  issue in the case, Dunbar had not offered any evidence regarding the statute \r\n  of limitations.  \r\n   \r\nJust prior to eliciting the testimony \r\n  at issue, defense counsel repeatedly asked Taylor about her mother's health \r\n  during the time she was being treated by Carlson. Counsel asked Taylor whether \r\n  her mother's health \"was bad\" from 1992 to 1994, which Taylor confirmed. In \r\n  a series of questions, defense counsel thereafter asked Taylor about her mother's \r\n  hypertension, back surgery, knee problems, and neurological problems. He also \r\n  asked about the fact that in 1993 to 1994, her mother's glucose levels \"skyrocketed.\" \r\n  He then asked her about taking toxic levels of medication. Counsel then stated, \r\n  \"When you first started going with your mother to Carlson, you never thought \r\n  anything was wrong, did you? You were happy with his care; correct?\" Dunbar \r\n  responded, \"I personally, between 1992 and 1994, encouraged my mother to leave \r\n  Carlson's care. When you speak of her blood sugar as going up as you did just, \r\n  you know, infectious states can drive the blood sugar up as well, and I felt \r\n  that was a primary factor in the diabetes . . . .\" Upon further questioning \r\n  about when she became concerned, Taylor stated she couldn't be specific about \r\n  the time frame, but thought it was in early 1992. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Williams v. Addison, 314 \r\n  S.C. 35, 443 S.E.2d 582 (Ct. App. 1994), we observed that implied consent will \r\n  not be found if all of the parties did not recognize it as an issue at trial: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhere issues are not raised by the \r\n  pleadings but are tried by consent, amendments to the pleadings are desirable \r\n  because they bring the pleadings in line with the issues actually developed \r\n  at the trial. Amendments to conform to the proof should be liberally allowed \r\n  when no prejudice to the opposing party will result. The decision to permit \r\n  an amendment is within the trial court's discretion. Nevertheless, this \r\n  Court will not find implied consent to try an issue if all of the parties did \r\n  not recognize it as an issue during trial, even though there is evidence in \r\n  the record -- introduced as relevant to some other issue -- which would support \r\n  the amendment. This is so because the opposing party may not be conscious \r\n  of the relevance of the evidence to issues not raised by the pleadings if the \r\n  relevance is not otherwise made clear. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n314 S.C. at 38, 443 S.E.2d at 584 \r\n  (citations omitted) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, defense counsel questioned \r\n  Taylor extensively about her mother's health and the time frame for her various \r\n  illnesses, the obvious implication being that her mother's infections and poor \r\n  condition were attributable, at least in some part, to her overall medical condition, \r\n  especially her diabetes. Questions about the timing of these illnesses were \r\n  pertinent to establishing proximate cause. Since the evidence was admissible \r\n  for another purpose and it appears Dunbar did not recognize counsel intended \r\n  to assert the statute of limitations, we conclude she did not impliedly consent \r\n  to try that issue. See Id. Moreover, the prejudice to Dunbar \r\n  is obvious. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's decision to grant the \r\n  amendment. \r\n   \r\nB. Directed \r\n  Verdict \r\n   \r\nBecause we find the trial judge improvidently \r\n  granted the motion to amend, we necessarily reverse his decision to grant a \r\n  directed verdict on the very ground asserted by that amendment. Dunbar argued \r\n  in her brief and at oral argument that if this court affirmed the trial judge's \r\n  decision to grant the amendment, the decision to grant a directed verdict was \r\n  nonetheless error. While our decision on the propriety of the amendment resolves \r\n  this appeal, we note for purposes of remand that generally, statute of limitations \r\n  issues are for the jury, rather than the court, to resolve. See Arant \r\n  v. Kressler, 327 S.C. 225, 229, 489 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1997) (stating when \r\n  there is conflicting testimony regarding time of discovery of facts giving notice \r\n  of a medical malpractice claim, the date on which discovery should have been \r\n  made becomes an issue for the jury to decide); Brown v. Finger, 240 S.C. \r\n  102, 113, 124 S.E.2d 781, 786 (1962) (same). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. Lack of Court Reporter \r\n  for Rule 59 Hearing \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDunbar asserts the trial judge erred \r\n  in holding a hearing without a court reporter on her motion to alter or amend \r\n  the judgment. In light of our disposition of Dunbar's other issues on appeal, \r\n  we need not reach this issue. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Carlson's Appeal \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStatute of Repose \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCarlson contends the trial judge \r\n  erred in denying his motions to amend his answer to assert the statute of repose \r\n  and for a directed verdict on this ground. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter the plaintiff had rested her \r\n  case at trial, Carlson moved to amend his answer to assert the six-year statute \r\n  of repose. The statute of repose is contained in Â§ 15-3-545(A)'s provision that \r\n  the action must be commenced not more than \"six years from date of occurrence.\" \r\n  Thus, the statute of repose imposes an outer limit for filing a medical malpractice \r\n  action, regardless of when it is discovered. O'Tuel v. Villani, 318 S.C. \r\n  324, 327, 455 S.E.2d 698, 700 (Ct. App. 1995), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, ___ S.C. ___, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  716 (2000). \r\n   \r\nAt trial, defense counsel argued \r\n  there was testimony from Jablon based on his review of Dunbar's x-rays that \r\n  Carlson deviated from the standard of care in 1987. As noted above, Jablon testified \r\n  he thought there was some bone loss visible in an x-ray Carlson took of Dunbar \r\n  in late 1987 which would indicate the beginning stages of periodontal disease. \r\n  Dunbar brought this action in 1995. Defense counsel asserted the six-year statute \r\n  of repose would bar Dunbar's action because it was brought more than six years \r\n  after the condition could have been diagnosed, and South Carolina does not recognize \r\n  the continuous treatment rule.(1) \r\n   \r\nDunbar first argued that defense \r\n  counsel took Jablon's deposition and \"[t]hey had all the information that they \r\n  have here [at trial] at the time of the deposition[.]\" Dunbar noted Carlson \r\n  had the opportunity to move for an amendment of his answer after the deposition \r\n  but failed to do so. Second, Dunbar argued that, while Jablon's testimony could \r\n  fairly be interpreted to state there might have been some negligence in 1987, \r\n  \"there certainly was negligence in '92 and continuing on until '94 when [Dunbar] \r\n  found out about it.\" The trial judge denied the motion to amend the pleadings \r\n  to assert the statute of repose. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAmendments to pleadings may properly \r\n  be denied where \"there are circumstances such as inexcusable delay, or the taking \r\n  of the adverse party by surprise, or the like, which might justify a refusal \r\n  to amend.\" Braudie v. Richland County, 217 S.C. 57, 59-60, 59 S.E.2d \r\n  548, 549 (1950); see also Crowley v. Spivey, 285 S.C. 397, 414, \r\n  329 S.E.2d 774, 784 (Ct. App. 1985) (stating the decision to amend the pleadings \r\n  is within the trial court's discretion, and circumstances such as inexcusable \r\n  delay and surprise to the adverse party justify a refusal to amend). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge did not abuse his \r\n  discretion in denying the amendment under the circumstances present here. Although \r\n  Carlson already had deposition testimony from Jablon establishing that he believed \r\n  Carlson should have diagnosed Dunbar's condition as early as 1987, he did not \r\n  move to amend his answer until after the plaintiff rested her case at trial. \r\n  Jablon testified during his deposition that Carlson deviated from the standard \r\n  of care many times during the period that Dunbar was his patient by not documenting \r\n  her periodontal disease and by giving her inappropriate treatment. He also stated \r\n  that he could tell periodontal disease was present in 1987 based on Carlson's \r\n  file indicating Dunbar had swollen tissue and painful abscesses, and that Carlson \r\n  should have treated her then for periodontal disease. Thus, the defense was \r\n  well aware of this potential ground prior to trial. See Alamance \r\n  Indus.v. Chesterfield Hosiery Mill, 239 S.C. 287, 290-91, 122 S.E.2d 648, \r\n  649 (1961) (finding no abuse of discretion to deny request to amend answer five \r\n  days before trial where defendant was aware of the factual matter that was the \r\n  subject of the proposed amendment from the time the suit was commenced eight \r\n  months earlier). Accordingly, we conclude the trial judge did not abuse his \r\n  discretion in denying Carlson's motions to amend his answer and for a directed \r\n  verdict based on the six-year statute of repose. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1.  Under the \r\n  continuous treatment rule, \"if the treatment by the doctor is a continuing course \r\n  and the patient's illness, injury or condition is of such a nature as to impose \r\n  on the doctor a duty of continuing treatment and care, the statute does not \r\n  commence running until treatment by the doctor for the particular disease or \r\n  condition involved has terminated.\" Anderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, \r\n  524, 476 S.E.2d 475, 476 (1996) (quoting Davis W. Louisell &amp; Harold Williams, \r\n  Medical Malpractice, Â¶ 13.02[3] (1995)). Our supreme court noted in Short \r\n  that \"most courts will not apply the rule to toll the running of a statute of \r\n  limitations if before treatment ends the patient discovers or should have discovered \r\n  the injury giving rise to the cause of action.\" Id. at 525, 476 S.E.2d \r\n  at 476. The court expressly declined to decide whether South Carolina would \r\n  adopt the continuous treatment rule, finding the claim in that case would be \r\n  time-barred even if the rule were applied.

The jury returned a verdict for the school district and Elledge appeals, \r\n  arguing the trial judge erred in excluding evidence of playground industry standards \r\n  and in charging the jury. We reverse and remand.  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY  \r\nOn December 9, 1994, Ginger Sierra, \r\n  a nine-year-old fourth grader at Irmo Elementary School, slipped and fell while \r\n  playing on the school playground's modified monkey bars. The bars were originally \r\n  designed to stand approximately four and one-half feet off the ground with a \r\n  bench running underneath. Children were encouraged to sit or lie on the bench \r\n  and pull themselves along the length of the bars. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1991, after the school principal \r\n  noticed some children climbing on top of the bars rather than lying on the bench, \r\n  he contracted with a playground equipment sales representative to make safety \r\n  recommendations. The representative, who was not trained or licensed as an engineer, \r\n  eventually modified the monkey bars by removing the bench and lowering the bars. \r\n  The resulting apparatus formed an inclined \"ladder,\" with parallel bars from \r\n  twenty to thirty inches off the ground. Tires were also installed at each end \r\n  of the bars for mounting and dismounting, and the children were encouraged to \r\n  walk across from one end to the other. Despite the fact that the thin side bars \r\n  were not intended as a walking surface, neither handrails nor a non-slip surface \r\n  was added to the \"new\" monkey bars. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn the day of her accident, Ginger \r\n  was walking across the bars after a light rain. Her foot slipped on a narrow \r\n  bar, causing her to fall, and her right leg became trapped between the bars. \r\n  As a result, Ginger suffered a severe \"spiral-type\" fracture in her right femur, \r\n  resulting in damage to the thighbone's growth plate. Following a lengthy convalescence, \r\n  doctors removed the growth plates in both her legs to prevent uneven growth. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn August 27, 1997, Elledge sued \r\n  Richland/Lexington School District 5 (District) for negligence and gross negligence \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-40 and 15-78-60(25), respectively, of the \r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act.(1) A jury trial \r\n  was held June 15-17, 1998. Prior to trial, the District filed a motion in limine, \r\n  which the trial court granted, to exclude \"any testimony and/or documentary \r\n  evidence\" relating to the Consumer Products Safety Commission's (CPSC) guidelines \r\n  for playground safety or the American Society for Testing and Materials' (ASTM) \r\n  standards for playground equipment. The court adhered to its ruling during trial, \r\n  and Elledge proffered excerpts from written and video depositions to support \r\n  her claim that such evidence was relevant to the applicable standard of care. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 17, 1998, the jury returned \r\n  a verdict for the District. The trial court denied all post-trial motions and \r\n  this appeal followed.  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA trial court's decision to exclude \r\n  evidence will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law. See, Recco Tape &amp; Label Co. v. Barfield, \r\n  312 S.C. 214, 217, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1994); Krepps by Krepps v. Ausen, \r\n  324 S.C. 597, 608, 479 S.E.2d 290, 297 (Ct. App. 1996). To warrant reversal \r\n  on appeal, a party must show both the error of the court's ruling and resulting \r\n  prejudice. Barfield, 312 S.C. at 216, 439 S.E.2d at 840; Doe v. Doe, \r\n  324 S.C. 492, 499, 478 S.E.2d 854, 858 (Ct. App. 1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nElledge first asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in excluding evidence of the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards, arguing \r\n  such evidence was relevant to establish the appropriate standard of care. We \r\n  agree.  \r\n   \r\nEvidence of industry standards, customs, \r\n  and practices is \"often highly probative when defining a standard of care.\" \r\n  57A Am. Jur. 2d Negligence Â§ 185 (1999). Safety standards promulgated \r\n  by government or industry organizations in particular are relevant to the standard \r\n  of care for negligence. See, Frazier v. Continental Oil Co., \r\n  568 F.2d 378, 382 n.11 (5th Cir. 1978) (\"[E]vidence of custom within a particular \r\n  industry, group, or organization is admissible as bearing on the standard of \r\n  care in determining negligence.\" (quoting Muncie Aviation Corp. v. Party \r\n  Doll Fleet, Inc., 519 F.2d 1178, 1180 (5th Cir. 1975))); Brown v. Clark \r\n  Equip. Co., 618 P.2d 267, 276 (Haw. 1980) (finding safety data, codes or \r\n  standards promulgated by voluntary industry organizations \"admissible as evidence \r\n  on the issue of negligence\" and \"as an alternative to or utilized to buttress \r\n  expert testimony\"); Phelps v. Duke Power Co., 332 S.E.2d 715, 717 (N.C. \r\n  Ct. App. 1985) (lower court erred in excluding evidence of National Electrical \r\n  Safety Code because such evidence \"is instructive as to whether an electrical \r\n  company used reasonable care\" and thereby \"admissible as an aid to the prudent \r\n  or reasonable man rule\"); Stone v. United Eng'g, 475 S.E.2d 439, 454 \r\n  (W. Va. 1996) (\"Courts have become increasingly appreciative of the value of \r\n  national safety codes and other guidelines issued by governmental and voluntary \r\n  associations to assist the trier of fact in applying the standard of due care \r\n  in negligence cases.\"); see also, 57A Am. Jur. 2d at Â§ 186 (1999) (\"A \r\n  safety code ordinarily represents a consensus of opinion carrying the approval \r\n  of a significant segment of an industry, and is not introduced as substantive \r\n  law but most often as illustrative evidence of safety practices or rules generally \r\n  prevailing in the industry that provides support for expert testimony concerning \r\n  the proper standard of care.\" (internal citation omitted)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, the trial court \r\n  precluded Elledge's evidence of the CPSC guidelines and ASTM standards for playground \r\n  safety based on the mistaken belief that the District must have adopted these \r\n  national protocols before such evidence was admissible. This was error. The \r\n  District cites no cases, and we are aware of none, mandating promulgation or \r\n  implementation of national industry standards prior to their admission in a \r\n  negligence case. To the contrary, while such proof might be necessary in attempting \r\n  to establish negligence per se, it is not required when the evidence is offered \r\n  to demonstrate an applicable standard of care. See, Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, \r\n  Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 546-47, 462 S.E.2d 321, 330 (Ct. App. 1995) (approving \r\n  admission of industry standards evidence, including evidence of manufacturer's \r\n  safety organization, to establish standard of care in products liability action); \r\n  Taylor, Thon, Thompson &amp; Peterson v. Cannaday, 749 P.2d 63, 66 (Mont. \r\n  1988) (Architects' Handbook of Professional Practice describing the standard \r\n  of practice for architects in the United States was admissible as evidence of \r\n  negligence despite fact that such was not conclusive proof thereof); Ruffiner \r\n  v. Material Serv. Corp., 506 N.E.2d 581, 584 (Ill. 1987) (evidence of standards \r\n  promulgated by industry, trade, or regulatory groups or agencies may be relevant \r\n  and admissible to aid the trier of fact in determining the standard of care \r\n  in a negligence action \"even though the standards have not been imposed by statute \r\n  or promulgated by a regulatory body and therefore do not have the force of law\"); \r\n  Sawyer v. Dreis &amp; Krump Mfg. Co., 493 N.E.2d 920, 925 (N.Y. 1986) \r\n  (national standards were properly admitted and could be considered by the jury \r\n  as some evidence of negligence but they were not conclusive on the subject of \r\n  negligence and the jury should have been so instructed); Jorgensen v. Horton, \r\n  206 N.W.2d 100, 103 (Iowa 1973) (\"Violation of standards in such [private safety] \r\n  codes is evidence on the issue of negligence but not negligence per se.\").  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the District's reliance \r\n  on Kiehner v. School Dist. of Pennsylvania, 712 A.2d 830 (Pa. Commw. \r\n  Ct. 1998) is misplaced. In Kiehner, the appeals court affirmed the exclusion \r\n  of the Building Officials and Code Administrators National Building Code in \r\n  a negligence suit against a Philadelphia school, because it had been adopted \r\n  by the city under express terms that existing structures would not be required \r\n  to retrofit or remodel to achieve compliance. As the school in question was \r\n  built before the code was adopted, its admission into evidence was held to be \r\n  unfairly prejudicial. Kiehner, 712 A.2d at 832. In addition, the court's \r\n  opinion did not express the view that national standards and guidelines were \r\n  inadmissible when they were not adopted by a particular defendant. \r\n  Accordingly, we adhere to the view as expressed in the above cases, and as articulated \r\n  by the New Jersey Supreme Court:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[A] [safety] code is not introduced \r\n  as substantive law, as proof of regulations or absolute standards having the \r\n  force of law or scientific truth. It is offered in connection with expert testimony \r\n  which identifies it as illustrative evidence of safety practices or rules generally \r\n  prevailing in the industry, and as such it provides support for the opinion \r\n  of the expert concerning the proper standard of care.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMcComish v. DeSoi, 200 A.2d \r\n  116, 121 (N.J. 1964).  \r\n   \r\nThe District further asserts even \r\n  if it was error to exclude evidence of the applicable industry standards, Elledge \r\n  suffered no prejudice as a result. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nElledge proffered substantial video \r\n  deposition testimony from Steven Bernheim, an expert in playground safety and \r\n  equipment, concerning industry standards as outlined in the CPSC and ASTM. Specifically, \r\n  Bernheim would have testified to the District's deviation from the accepted \r\n  standard of care in the field. Moreover, Elledge intended to offer evidence \r\n  that the District had notice of these standards, and that they were fully enforced \r\n  regarding District purchases of new playground equipment. The exclusion \r\n  of this testimony was clearly prejudicial since such evidence would tend to \r\n  show the District's compliance with industry standards, which directly conflicts \r\n  with the District's assertion that such standards were never recognized. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nElledge lastly argues the trial court \r\n  erred in charging the jury that the District could not be held liable for negligence \r\n  in the absence of actual notice as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-60(16) \r\n  (Supp. 1999) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.(2) \r\n  While we need not address this issue in light of our disposition above, for \r\n  remand purposes, we find the case of Strother v. Lexington County Recreation \r\n  Comm'n., 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117, 123 (1998) instructive on the issue \r\n  of actual notice. \r\n   \r\nBecause we find the trial court committed \r\n  reversible error in refusing to admit relevant evidence of industry standards, \r\n  the judgment of the court below is \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON, and HUFF, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.

Myers, of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J.: Stacy \r\n  A. Brannon appeals his convictions for burglary, criminal sexual assault and \r\n  possession of a weapon during a violent crime. He contends the trial court erred \r\n  in denying his right to counsel, in failing to suppress the victim's identifications, \r\n  in denying his motion for a continuance because his expert witness was absent \r\n  and in sentencing him to consecutive life sentences. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe victim was home with her two \r\n  sleeping children when a man entered her home and raped her at knife point. \r\n  As he left he took six rings valued at $50 and a piggy bank containing approximately \r\n  $20 in change. On the same day, the victim was treated at the hospital and gave \r\n  a written statement to law enforcement. The next day the victim identified Brannon \r\n  as her assailant from a photo lineup. DNA analysis identified Brannon as the \r\n  source of the semen collected from the victim during the rape kit examination. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nI.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrannon first argues the trial court \r\n  erred in denying his motion to recess for the day because his expert witness \r\n  on the subject of the reliability of eyewitness identifications could not testify \r\n  until the following day. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter the State rested, Brannon requested \r\n  a recess until the next day because his expert had a prior engagement and was \r\n  not then available. The trial court denied Brannon's request because Brannon \r\n  failed to subpoena the expert even though the court informed Brannon a day earlier \r\n  that if the expert was under subpoena, the court would make certain the expert \r\n  was there.  \r\n   \r\n\"As with requests for a trial continuance, \r\n  requests for a recess during trial are within the trial judge's discretion, \r\n  and will be reversed on appeal only upon a showing of an abuse of that discretion.\" \r\n  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 192, 498 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1998); State \r\n  v. Holland, 261 S.C. 488, 498, 201 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1973) (\"[T]he granting \r\n  or the refusal of an adjournment or suspension of a trial of a criminal case \r\n  rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\"). Defense counsel did not \r\n  subpoena the witness even after the trial court assured Brannon that it would \r\n  obtain the expert's presence at trial, as long as the expert was under subpoena. \r\n  A party cannot complain of an error induced by the party's own conduct. State \r\n  v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the appellant must show \r\n  prejudice stemming from the trial court's denial of the motion to recess in \r\n  order for the denial to be reversible error. Mitchell, 330 S.C. at 194, \r\n  498 S.E.2d at 644-45. Here, Brannon rejected the solicitor's offer to stipulate \r\n  to the substance of the expert's proposed testimony. Nor does the record contain \r\n  any other offer of proof for us to review to determine if the testimony's omission \r\n  from the trial is prejudicial. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, the trial court charged \r\n  the jury regarding the difficulty of eyewitness identification. The court charged \r\n  that the identification of Brannon was made by a person of a different race \r\n  and that it may be \"more difficult to identify members of a different race than \r\n  members of one's own race.\" Without any more information in the record, we are \r\n  unable to conclude that the trial court's decision to deny Brannon's motion \r\n  for a recess was prejudicial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrannon argues the court erred in \r\n  failing to suppress the victim's identification because it was unreliable. We \r\n  disagree.  \r\n   \r\n\"The threshold inquiry in determining \r\n  the admissibility of testimony regarding a pretrial identification is whether \r\n  or not the testimonial evidence is sufficiently reliable to satisfy due process \r\n  safeguards against misidentification.\" State v. Brown, 333 S.C. 185, \r\n  189, 508 S.E.2d 38, 40 (Ct. App. 1998). Reliability depends upon several factors \r\n  that must be considered in light of the totality of the circumstances. They \r\n  are: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of \r\n  the crime; (2) the degree of the witness's attention to the events; (3) the \r\n  accuracy of the witness's prior description of the criminal; (4) the level of \r\n  certainty demonstrated by the witness at the time the identification was made; \r\n  and (5) the time elapsed between the crime and the identification. Id. \r\n  (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the victim testified in camera \r\n  that the room where the assault took place was brightly lit and that it was \r\n  approximately eight o'clock in the morning. She testified that she first saw \r\n  her attacker in the hallway as he rushed towards her. The victim stated the \r\n  face of her attacker was about eight to ten inches away for almost the entire \r\n  assault. Although the man had cut two eye holes in some pants and placed them \r\n  on his head, the victim related that the pants were loose and moved around on \r\n  the attacker's head so that she could see portions of his face at different \r\n  times. While unable to see her attacker's entire face at any one time, the victim \r\n  saw parts of his face repeatedly. The attack lasted approximately five minutes \r\n  and the victim testified that she paid her attacker \"great attention\" throughout \r\n  the assault.  \r\n   \r\nIn her statement to law enforcement, \r\n  the victim described her attacker as a black male, approximately 5'8\", weighing \r\n  135 pounds and between the ages of twenty and thirty. During the photographic \r\n  lineup the next day, the victim carefully considered each photograph before \r\n  ultimately selecting Brannon's photo without hesitation. The victim stated she \r\n  was \"very certain\" of the photo identification and had no doubt that the photo \r\n  chosen depicted her attacker.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe admission or exclusion of testimonial \r\n  evidence falls within the sound discretion of the trial court, whose decision \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse resulting in prejudice. See \r\n  State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941). We find the trial \r\n  court's in camera evaluation and subsequent admission of the victim's testimony \r\n  proper.  \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrannon next contends the trial court \r\n  denied his right to counsel of his choice. Brannon was represented by a public \r\n  defender. During roll call, Brannon maintained that he hired a private attorney \r\n  to represent him. After speaking to the attorney Brannon purportedly hired, \r\n  the trial court stated that the attorney wanted \"to convey to you and upon the \r\n  record and to your lawyer that she has not been retained by you, never has been \r\n  retained by you, has nothing to do with your case. Do you understand that?\" \r\n  Brannon then replied \"[y]es, sir.\" Brannon did not object and only raised the \r\n  issue again after sentencing, when he complained the court had forced him to \r\n  use a lawyer he did not want. Brannon, therefore, failed to preserve this issue \r\n  for review. See State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 499 S.E.2d 209 (failure \r\n  to object at trial preserves nothing for appeal), cert. denied, 525 U.S. \r\n  1022 (1998).\r\nIV. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLastly, Brannon argues the trial \r\n  court erred in refusing to vacate his consecutive life sentences without parole \r\n  because they are unconstitutional. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court found that Brannon \r\n  had a prior conviction for a most serious offense and sentenced him to consecutive \r\n  terms of life without parole for first degree burglary and criminal sexual assault. \r\n  The applicable statute provides, in relevant part: \"[U]pon a conviction for \r\n  a most serious offense as defined by this section, a person must be sentenced \r\n  to a term of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole if that \r\n  person has one or more prior convictions for . . . a most serious offense . \r\n  . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (A)(1) (Supp. 1999) (emphasis added). Under \r\n  this statutory scheme, armed robbery, burglary first, and first degree criminal \r\n  sexual assault are each classified as a most serious offense. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1).  \r\n   \r\nBrannon does not challenge the validity \r\n  of his prior conviction and sentence for armed robbery, its classification as \r\n  a most serious offense, or its use to invoke application of the enhanced punishment \r\n  statute. The issue before us, therefore, is whether Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1) is inherently \r\n  unconstitutional as a per se violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on \r\n  cruel and unusual punishment.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Under most circumstances, the severity \r\n  of a sentence prescribed for a particular offense remains a matter of legislative \r\n  prerogative. See State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34,\r\n515 S.E.2d 525 (1999). Thus, a reviewing \r\n  court \"should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures \r\n  necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes \r\n  . . . .\" Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983). On the other hand, \r\n  even when a particular sentence is authorized by statute, \"it may nonetheless \r\n  run afoul of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\" \r\n  Id. at 290 (emphasizing that \"no penalty is per se constitutional\"). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nHistorically, the Eighth Amendment \r\n  has precluded sentencing a criminal defendant to a term of imprisonment that \r\n  is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime it purports to punish. \r\n  See id. In Solem, the Supreme Court invalidated the discretionary \r\n  imposition of life without parole under a state sentencing enhancement statute, \r\n  where Solem's recidivist crime of uttering a no account check was predicated \r\n  on seven equally non-violent, relatively minor felonies. In so doing, the Court \r\n  articulated three factors a reviewing court should consider when undertaking \r\n  a proportionality analysis: 1) the gravity of the offense and harshness of the \r\n  penalty imposed; 2) the sentences imposed on other criminals within the same \r\n  jurisdiction; and 3) the sentences imposed for committing the same crime in \r\n  other jurisdictions. Id. at 290-92. These considerations were cited with \r\n  approval by our supreme court in State&nbsp;v. Kiser, 288 S.C. 441, 443, \r\n  343 S.E.2d 292, 293 (1986).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHowever, in the plurality opinion \r\n  of Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), a deeply divided Supreme \r\n  Court revisited the issue. Although Harmelin questioned the continued \r\n  viability of any proportionality doctrine in the Eighth Amendment context, a \r\n  majority of plurality members ultimately affirmed \"the narrow proportionality \r\n  principle that has existed in our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence for 80 years.\" \r\n  Id. at 996 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). \r\n  Nonetheless, the plurality nature of Harmelin left the status of Eighth \r\n  Amendment proportionality review somewhat unsettled.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn discussing this uncertainty, one \r\n  federal circuit has stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy applying a head-count analysis, \r\n  we find that seven members of the Court supported a continued Eighth Amendment \r\n  guarantee against disproportional sentences. Only four justices, however, supported \r\n  the continued application of all three factors [outlined] in Solem, and \r\n  five justices rejected it. Thus, this much is clear: disproportionality survives; \r\n  Solem does not. Only Justice Kennedy's opinion reflects [this] view. \r\n  It is to his opinion, therefore, that we turn for direction. Accordingly, we \r\n  will initially make a threshold comparison of the gravity of McGruder's offenses \r\n  against the severity of his sentence. Only if we infer that the sentence is \r\n  grossly disproportionate to the offense will we then consider the remaining \r\n  factors of the Solem test and compare the sentence received to (1) sentences \r\n  for similar crimes in the same jurisdiction and (2) sentences for the same crime \r\n  in other jurisdictions.  \r\n   \r\nMcGruder v. Puckett, 954 F.2d \r\n  313, 316 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 849 (1992). At least one \r\n  state court also has adopted this view. See Puga v. State, 916 \r\n  S.W.2d 547, 549 (Tex. App. 1996, no pet.) (\"We agree with the Fifth Circuit \r\n  that disproportionality survives after Harmelin, and we will review a \r\n  sentence to determine whether it is grossly disproportionate to the crime.\"). \r\n  We agree with the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of Harmelin, and likewise \r\n  approve the concurring opinion's approach to disproportionality analysis. As \r\n  a result, we first compare the gravity of the crimes covered in Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) \r\n  with the harshness of the sentence required under Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1) of our statutory \r\n  scheme.  \r\n   \r\nThe statute in question provides \r\n  for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole \r\n  upon a defendant's conviction for a second most serious offense. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1) (Supp. 1999). With two exceptions not raised \r\n  here, the applicable most serious offenses specifically delineated under the \r\n  statute's terms are limited to crimes of violence (including related attempts \r\n  or conspiracy to commit them). Id. Given these limitations, the crimes \r\n  encompassed in Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) are almost by definition more grave than the \r\n  offense meriting life without parole in Harmelin, where the Court upheld \r\n  Harmelin's conviction for first-time possession of a large quantity of cocaine. \r\n  In his opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Kennedy explained that \"the \r\n  Michigan Legislature could with reason conclude that the threat posed to the \r\n  individual and society by possession of this large an amount of cocaine-in terms \r\n  of violence, crime, and social displacement-[was] momentous enough to warrant \r\n  the deterrence and retribution of a life sentence without parole.\" Harmelin, \r\n  501 U.S. at 1003.  \r\n   \r\nIn our view, the severity of the \r\n  crimes enumerated in Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) similarly brings a life sentence without \r\n  possibility of parole within the constitutional bounds of the Eighth Amendment. \r\n  Because our comparative analysis of the most serious offense subsections found \r\n  in Â§ 17-25-45 does not raise an \"inference of gross disproportionality,\" we \r\n  need not review the two remaining factors outlined in Solem. See \r\n  Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1004 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring \r\n  in the judgment) (stating that Solem \"did not announce a rigid three-part \r\n  test\" for proportionality review). Accordingly, we find the enhanced penalty \r\n  scheme mandated by S.C. Code Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1) &amp; (C)(1) (Supp. 1999) is not \r\n  unconstitutional per se.  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Brannon's \r\n  convictions are \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3197","title":"State v.

The State appeals. \r\n  We affirm in part and vacate in part. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn August 4, 1997, Martin was involved \r\n  in a single-car accident. Officer Lloyd Sells of the South Carolina Highway \r\n  Patrol issued Martin a uniform traffic ticket for\r\nDUI, first offense, and told Martin \r\n  to appear in Lexington County Traffic Court(1) \r\n  on August 26, 1997. A few days later and upon further investigation, Sells discovered \r\n  Martin's passenger had been rendered a quadriplegic as a result of the accident. \r\n  In a meeting with Martin, her attorney, and her parents, Sells informed Martin \r\n  of his decision to upgrade the charge. Sells retrieved Martin's copy of the \r\n  DUI ticket, wrote Martin a new ticket for felony DUI, told her not to appear \r\n  in traffic court on August 26, and informed her that the solicitor's office \r\n  would contact her for a new trial date in general sessions court. Thereafter, \r\n  Sells retrieved the copy of the original ticket which had been sent to the traffic \r\n  court. At this point, Sells had in his possession all five copies of the original \r\n  DUI ticket.  \r\n   \r\nOn the scheduled trial date of August \r\n  26, Lexington County Magistrate Shirley&nbsp;M. Sons was absent on leave. Christine \r\n  Tindall, a court assistant, processed tickets that day. Tindall filled out the \r\n  paperwork for Martin's original DUI ticket which remained in Sells's ticket \r\n  book, indicating (1) Martin was found guilty after a bench trial in her absence, \r\n  (2) a $425 fine was imposed, and (3) a bench warrant was issued for Martin's \r\n  arrest. However, neither Magistrate Sons nor any other judge ever held a trial \r\n  regarding this ticket. Sells, who happened to be in court on other matters, \r\n  realized the error and stopped Tindall from signing the magistrate's name to \r\n  the ticket, informing her the original ticket had been withdrawn. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSells thereafter forwarded all five \r\n  copies of the ticket along with a voided summons form to the Department of Public \r\n  Safety (DPS) where an officer wrote \"void\" on the back of the agency copy. An \r\n  administrative assistant filling in for the employee who customarily processed \r\n  voided tickets processed the DUI ticket, but failed to stamp \"void\" on the copies \r\n  forwarded to Driver Records. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn employee of Driver Records, noting \r\n  the ticket contained dispositional information but no signature from the presiding \r\n  judge, returned the ticket to the traffic court. Tindall then signed the ticket \r\n  and returned it to DPS. Magistrate Sons was not present when the ticket was \r\n  signed, nor was it signed under her personal supervision. Thereafter, Martin's \r\n  DUI conviction was entered, and her license was suspended effective December \r\n  22, 1997. Driver Records sent a notice of the suspension to Martin in December \r\n  1997, showing a conviction date of August 26, 1997. When Martin's attorney appeared \r\n  on December 16, 1997 to pay the $425 fine, a court employee issued a receipt \r\n  for payment even though she could not locate the ticket in the computer system. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 2, 1998, Sells's supervisor, \r\n  Officer Scott Hicks, obtained an Ishmell(2) \r\n  order, ostensibly signed by Magistrate Sons, to reopen the case against Martin. \r\n  Tammy Metts, a court employee handling the Ishmell orders, signed Magistrate \r\n  Sons's name to the order; however, Magistrate Sons was not present nor did she \r\n  have direct supervisory control over Metts when the order was signed. Furthermore, \r\n  the order was issued without notice to Martin. The order explained: \"[T]his \r\n  ticket was signed off on in error. It should be a felony DUI. Please remove \r\n  from Ms. Martin's license until the trial is disposed of in General Sessions.\" \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn response to the June 2, 1998 order, \r\n  DPS removed the purported DUI conviction from its records. Martin then received \r\n  a letter from the Division of Motor Vehicles telling her to disregard the prior \r\n  suspension notice as the summons was signed off in error. Martin appealed the \r\n  magistrate's June 2nd order and asked that the conviction of August 26, 1997 \r\n  be confirmed. The circuit court ruled that the June 2nd order reopening the \r\n  conviction should be vacated because the State's motion was untimely and made \r\n  without notice to Martin. The court then purported to reinstate the alleged \r\n  DUI conviction. The State appeals.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The State argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding Martin was ever convicted of DUI by Magistrate Sons(3) \r\n  on August 26, 1997. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn her return in the circuit court \r\n  appeal, Magistrate Sons described the circumstances surrounding the alleged \r\n  DUI conviction of August 26, 1997. Magistrate Sons stated, \"We [the magistrate's \r\n  office] never had this ticket in this office.\" She explained that when Hicks \r\n  sought to reopen the case, her employee, Metts, signed her (Magistrate Sons's) \r\n  name to the order of June 2, 1998 because \"[t]his is the procedure that has \r\n  been done in this office for many years. This is what she has been taught.\" \r\n  Magistrate Sons conceded in her return that Metts filled out the form stating \r\n  a motion was made on September 5, 1997 because \"Metts was told when she started \r\n  doing this particular job, that the date on that form had to be within 10 days \r\n  of the trial date. That is why she put that date on the order.\" Finally, Magistrate \r\n  Sons conceded: \r\n   \r\n[Martin] did not receive any notice \r\n  of the re-opening because it was not handled properly. This office does not \r\n  have any reason to re-open because we never had the ticket. The Ishmell \r\n  order should not have been sent in to the Highway Dept. It was a clerical error. \r\n  She [Metts] took the word of Officer Hicks. She did not ask me.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(Emphasis added.) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSells, with Martin's parents and \r\n  attorney present, retrieved Martin's original DUI ticket and issued her a new \r\n  ticket for felony DUI. The officer instructed Martin that she need not appear \r\n  in traffic court on the scheduled trial date of August&nbsp;26, 1997 because \r\n  the original DUI ticket was void. Magistrate Sons admitted her office never \r\n  held a valid ticket charging Martin with DUI. Moreover, it is undisputed that \r\n  no magistrate heard Martin's case and no trial was ever held in her absence. \r\n  As noted by our supreme court, the ticket signed by the court employee \"contained \r\n  numerous inaccuracies, including a statement that the case was brought before \r\n  a magistrate.\" In re Sons, 335 S.C. 343, 345, 517 S.E.2d 214, 215 \r\n  (emphasis added). The supreme court further found \"[t]he Ishmell order \r\n  contained factual inaccuracies, including that Martin's ticket had been disposed \r\n  of on August 26, 1997 and that the request to reopen had been made on September \r\n  5, 1997.\" Id. (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe thus conclude Martin could not \r\n  have been convicted of DUI as no magistrate held a duly-constituted trial on \r\n  August 26, 1997 or at any other time concerning her traffic violation. Rather, \r\n  a series of administrative errors occurred that resulted in a court employee \r\n  incorrectly noting that Martin, in her absence, had been convicted of DUI at \r\n  a bench trial. We affirm the circuit court's decision to vacate the June 2, \r\n  1998 Ishmell order, but vacate the portion of the order which required \r\n  the reinstatement of Martin's DUI conviction. \r\nBecause we have determined that no \r\n  valid conviction occurred, we need not consider the State's remaining arguments. \r\n  See, e.g., Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 \r\n  S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (noting that an appellate court need not address \r\n  appellant's remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive); \r\n  Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d \r\n  886 (1993) (noting appellate court need not address remaining issues when determination \r\n  of prior issue is dispositive). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED \r\n  IN PART. \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n1.

Hill's statutory beneficiaries and $1,000,000.00 \r\n  to her estate. S. Perry Davis, M.D., the sole remaining defendant at trial, \r\n  appeals. We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHill had been a patient of Davis's \r\n  family practice since August 5, 1974. On October 25, 1991, Hill consulted Davis \r\n  complaining of soreness in her left breast. After examining Hill, Davis referred \r\n  her to Tuomey Regional Medical Center in Sumter for a bilateral mammogram, which \r\n  was done November 5, 1991. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe entry on Hill's chart for October \r\n  25, 1991, contained the handwritten notation \"two weeks.\" It is unclear whether \r\n  or not that notation meant Hill was given a follow-up appointment for that time; \r\n  however, it is undisputed Hill did not see Davis in the weeks following the \r\n  mammogram and Davis's office made no attempt to contact her about this matter. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMartin Rosefield, M.D., the radiologist \r\n  who read Hill's mammogram, found it revealed a \"cluster of microcalcifications \r\n  in the right breast . . . .\" In his report, Rosefield noted, \"[T]hese calcifications \r\n  must be considered suspicious for possible neoplastic change.\" Rosefield also \r\n  recommended an excisional biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis received the suspicious mammogram \r\n  report, but did not read it until 1993. He neither advised Hill of the results \r\n  of the test nor sent her for an excisional biopsy in 1991 as recommended. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 22, 1993, Hill consulted \r\n  Davis about a lump in her right breast. At this visit, Davis's nurse noticed \r\n  the 1991 mammogram, which had been incorrectly placed at the back of Hill's \r\n  chart. Davis read the 1991 mammogram during this visit. He also referred Hill \r\n  to a surgeon, who ordered another mammogram. This 1993 mammogram revealed a \r\n  large six-centimeter carcinoma in the right breast, and the report stated the \r\n  cancer had metastasized to Hill's lymph nodes. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHill underwent a mastectomy, which \r\n  was followed by a biopsy of a cervical lymph node, chemotherapy, and radiation \r\n  treatments. Hill was in pain after the mastectomy and suffered from fatigue \r\n  as a result of the chemotherapy. As the disease progressed, Hill became bedridden, \r\n  and her fourteen-year old daughter Emily became primarily responsible for providing \r\n  her daily care and for maintaining their household. Eventually, both Hill and \r\n  Emily went to live with Hill's son, Jody Haselden, and his wife in their small \r\n  apartment in Newport News, Virginia. There, the Haseldens' dining room became \r\n  Hill's hospital room. Hill died on August 22, 1994, at age 47. Her death certificate \r\n  indicated the cause of death was breast carcinoma. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHaselden, as the personal representative \r\n  of Hill's estate, filed survival and wrongful death actions on November 1, 1994, \r\n  against Davis, Rosefield, and Tuomey Regional Medical Center. Before trial, \r\n  Rosefield and Tuomey Regional Medical Center were dismissed as defendants. The \r\n  actions were consolidated and proceeded to trial against Davis.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial commenced on March 24, \r\n  1997, and ended in jury awards of $1,082,103.71 in the wrongful death action \r\n  and $1,000,000.00 in the survival action. In arriving at the verdicts, however, \r\n  the jury determined that Davis and Hill had each been negligent in proximately \r\n  causing Hill's injuries. Because the jury attributed ten per cent of the combined \r\n  negligence to Hill and ninety per cent to Davis, the trial court combined the \r\n  verdicts and reduced the aggregate amount to $1,873,893.30, which was then enrolled \r\n  as a judgment against Davis. The trial court denied Davis's motions for judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, new trial, and new trial nisi remittitur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n   \r\n   \r\nA. Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis first argues the trial court \r\n  should have granted his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because \r\n  Haselden failed to prove the necessary causal link between his alleged misconduct \r\n  and Hill's death. To support his argument, Davis contends the evidence at trial \r\n  demonstrated, at most, the \"loss of chance,\" a doctrine that has been rejected \r\n  in this state. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Jones v. Owings,(1) \r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court declined to adopt the \"loss of chance\" doctrine, \r\n  which, in the context of medical malpractice, \"permits a recovery when the delay \r\n  in proper diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition results in the patient \r\n  being deprived of a less [than an] even chance of surviving or recovering.\"(2) \r\n  In rejecting the doctrine, the supreme court, quoting from Cooper v. Sisters \r\n  of Charity,(3) stated, \"'We consider the \r\n  better rule to be that in order to comport with the standard of proof of proximate \r\n  cause, plaintiff in a malpractice case must prove that defendant's negligence, \r\n  in probability, proximately caused the death.'\"(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNotwithstanding the holding in Jones, \r\n  however, there was ample evidence in this case that Hill's death most probably \r\n  resulted from Davis's delay in reading and acting on the 1991 mammogram report. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBilly Clowney, M.D., whom Hill consulted \r\n  after receiving a verbal referral from Davis, testified the 1993 growth was \r\n  in the same area where microcalcifications detected in 1991 appeared. He stated \r\n  that Hill would have had a greater than seventy-per-cent chance of recovery \r\n  if she had been treated in 1991. Peter Klacksman, M.D., testified that Hill \r\n  had about an eighty-per-cent chance of surviving twenty years had she been treated \r\n  in 1991. Klacksman further believed that, when Hill learned of the tumor in \r\n  July 1993, she had only a fifteen-per-cent chance of surviving five years.\r\n \r\nBarry Singer, M.D., testified the \r\n  1991 mammogram indicated either a stage one tumor with no axillary node involvement \r\n  or at most a very early stage two tumor with microscopic axillary node involvement. \r\n  Singer further stated the probability of cure for stage one cancer was at least \r\n  ninety per cent and that for early stage two cancer was better than seventy \r\n  or eighty per cent. In addition, he noted that Hill's tumor had progressed to \r\n  either an advanced stage three or a stage four cancer by July 1993. The probability \r\n  of cure at that time, according to Singer, was \"extremely small,\" i.e., \r\n  at best less than twenty per cent. Finally, Singer opined that, to a reasonable \r\n  degree of medical certainty, the delay in Hill's treatment caused her tumor \r\n  to be \"upstaged\" and, therefore, was the cause of her death in that, by the \r\n  time the diagnosis was established, the tumor was not curable.(5) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn contrast to the decedent's chance \r\n  of survival in Jones, then, the record here has testimony that Hill would \r\n  have had more than an even chance of recovering if she had been advised of her \r\n  condition in 1991 and was deprived of this chance because of the delay in her \r\n  treatment. We therefore hold the evidence satisfied the \"most probably\" requirement \r\n  for expert medical testimony on causation(6) \r\n  and uphold the trial court's refusal to set aside the verdict. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. New Trial Absolute and New Trial \r\n  Nisi Remittitur \r\n   \r\nIn addition to Hill's medical expenses,(7) \r\n  the jury returned verdicts of $1,000,000.00 in each of the actions. Davis argues \r\n  the trial court should have either set these verdicts aside or reduced them \r\n  because they were grossly excessive, or, in the alternative, unduly generous. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"A new trial absolute should be granted \r\n  only if the verdict is so grossly excessive that it shocks the conscience of \r\n  the court and clearly indicates the amount of the verdict was the result of \r\n  caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or other improper motive.\"(8) \r\n  Furthermore, \"[t]he denial of the motion for a new trial nisi is within the \r\n  trial judge's discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.\"(9) Similarly, the trial court \r\n  alone has the discretionary power to grant a new trial nisi upon finding the \r\n  jury verdict is merely inadequate or excessive.(10) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAs Davis notes, Hill's children were \r\n  emancipated at the time of her death and did not produce evidence of pecuniary \r\n  loss. Furthermore, Haselden, Hill's son and the personal representative of her \r\n  estate, was living a considerable distance from his mother until shortly before \r\n  she died. Nonetheless, there was ample testimony about the shock, grief, and \r\n  personal loss they experienced as a result of their mother's death.(11) \r\n  Hill's twin sister Catherine Olsen testified Emily had a very close relationship \r\n  with Hill. Olsen also stated that both Haselden and Emily were greatly affected \r\n  by their mother's death and that Haselden suffered from insomnia and migraines \r\n  after Hill died. Haselden testified he never knew his father and Hill was \"pretty \r\n  much all [he] had\" while he was growing up. Similarly, Emily, who was only fifteen \r\n  when Hill died, testified she was raised by Hill. Emily testified that both \r\n  she and Haselden were hurt to see the pain and suffering their mother endured. \r\n  Emily was present when Hill died and testified that Hill's death was a \"major \r\n  loss\" to Haselden and that it was hard for her to go through each day knowing \r\n  she could not pick up the telephone and speak to her mother. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSimilarly, we hold the evidence supports \r\n  the trial court's refusal to set aside or modify the verdict in the survival \r\n  action. The record has exhaustive testimony about the conscious pain and suffering \r\n  Hill experienced before her death. Davis himself testified Hill felt the lump \r\n  in her breast several months before she consulted him on June 22, 1993. Hill \r\n  underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments. The effects \r\n  of Hill's illness and the side effects of the treatments she received included \r\n  hair loss, nausea, dizziness, headaches, incontinence, loss of mobility, and \r\n  the inability to speak clearly. Eventually, Hill became bedridden, and it became \r\n  painful for her to be moved from her bed to her wheelchair. She also became \r\n  severely depressed knowing she would die soon and leave her children. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe therefore agree with the trial \r\n  court that neither verdict was grossly excessive or shocking so as to warrant \r\n  a new trial absolute. We further hold the trial court acted within its discretion \r\n  in denying a new trial nisi remittitur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. Evidentiary Rulings \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis alleges error in several evidentiary \r\n  rulings by the trial court: (1) the admission of a videotape as demonstrative \r\n  evidence; (2) the admission of testimony that, on several occasions when Emily \r\n  went to Davis for medical treatment on her own behalf, Hill accompanied her; \r\n  (3) the admission of testimony that Emily gave birth to a child in 1995; (4) \r\n  the admission of certain testimony about the applicable standard of care; and \r\n  (5) the qualification of an expert witness. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1. Videotape \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court denied a motion in \r\n  limine by Davis to exclude a \"Day in the Life\" videotape of Hill that was made \r\n  eleven days before her death. Davis unsuccessfully raised the issue again in \r\n  his post-trial motions. In support of his argument, Davis alleges the probative \r\n  value of the videotape was substantially outweighed by the danger of: (1) unfair \r\n  prejudice, (2) confusion of the issues, and (3) misleading of the jury.(12) \r\n  We disagree. \r\n   \r\nThe admissibility of evidence is \r\n  within the trial court's discretion.(13) Absent \r\n  a showing of a clear abuse of that discretion, the trial court's admission or \r\n  rejection of evidence is not subject to reversal on appeal.(14) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nVideotapes are extensively used in \r\n  civil litigation and are routinely admitted into evidence by courts throughout \r\n  the country.(15) Specifically, \"day in the life\" \r\n  videotapes have been allowed into evidence and used in personal injury cases.(16) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn Hawkins v. Pathology Associates,(17) \r\n  this court affirmed the demonstrative use of a videotape showing a terminally \r\n  ill woman and her family. As in the present case, the sound was turned down \r\n  and a family member narrated and explained the events portrayed on the tape. \r\n  We held the videotape was not unduly prejudicial and the trial court did not \r\n  abuse its discretion in permitting the jury to view it.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSimilarly, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the trial court's decision to allow the jury to view the videotape of Hill's \r\n  daily activities near the end of her life. We have viewed the videotape and \r\n  find it to be a realistic depiction of Hill's condition and quality of life \r\n  just shortly before her demise. Despite the emotional impact, the tape was neither \r\n  graphic, gruesome, nor grotesque.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs in Hawkins, the audio portion \r\n  was turned off while the jury viewed videotape, with Haselden responding to \r\n  his attorney's questions while the videotape was played. Haselden stated the \r\n  videotape showed the hydraulic lift required to move Hill from her bed into \r\n  her wheelchair. The videotape also showed Hill's pain medications, sleeping \r\n  medications, and medications for swelling.(18) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDavis argues the videotape was confusing \r\n  because it gave the jury the mistaken impression that Hill's large size resulted \r\n  from her disease. Davis suggests the problem was exacerbated by remarks from \r\n  various witnesses that Hill was \"swollen.\" We find no reversible error.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFirst, contrary to Davis's arguments \r\n  that the videotape gave the jurors a false impression that Hill's swollen condition \r\n  resulted from her cancer, Haselden testified that Hill took medication for swelling. \r\n  Furthermore, even if the videotape and the accompanying remarks were misleading, \r\n  there was ample evidence that Davis could have used to correct the misapprehension. \r\n  As Davis's own brief recounts, his records, which were admitted into evidence, \r\n  documented Hill's weight gain before her cancer was diagnosed.(19) \r\n  No expert testified that Hill's weight gain was related to the developing cancer. \r\n  Davis himself also testified Hill's medications did not cause swelling. Whether \r\n  or not Hill's condition resulted from either the disease or her medications \r\n  was a question of fact for the jury.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe further find no merit to Davis's \r\n  argument that the videotape incorrectly suggested that he was responsible for \r\n  Hill's disfigurement from her having to undergo a mastectomy. In support of \r\n  this argument, Davis maintains that, even if the cancer had been diagnosed and \r\n  treatment promptly begun in 1991, Hill would still have needed a mastectomy. \r\n  To the contrary, both Clowney and Singer testified that, if Hill's cancer had \r\n  been diagnosed in 1991, she would most likely have been offered less radical \r\n  alternatives to a mastectomy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n2. Testimony that Hill was Present \r\n  During Emily's Appointments with Davis \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis additionally asserts the trial \r\n  court erred in admitting testimony that Emily had obtained medical treatment \r\n  from Davis between 1991 and 1993 and that Hill accompanied Emily to Davis's \r\n  office for these visits. We find this evidence was introduced to rebut Davis's \r\n  assertion he did not inform Hill of her mammogram results because he had no \r\n  contact with her as she failed to keep her follow-up appointment. There was \r\n  no error in its admission.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n3. Testimony About Emily's Daughter \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis also contends Emily's testimony \r\n  regarding her daughter was inadmissible because the child was not a beneficiary \r\n  of Hill's estate. In no way, however, did Emily discuss any damages incurred \r\n  by her child. To the contrary, Emily discussed only her own grief from losing \r\n  the guidance, support, and love of her mother in raising her child and her anguish \r\n  about the fact that her daughter would never know Hill, i.e., \r\n  the child's maternal grandmother. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in \r\n  the admission of this testimony. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n4. Testimony Regarding the Applicable \r\n  Standard of Care \r\n   \r\nDavis avers the trial court erred \r\n  in permitting testimony from two physicians that his negligence was not excused \r\n  by Hill's negligence in failing to keep her follow-up appointment in 1991. We \r\n  disagree.  \r\n   \r\nDavis opened the door to this testimony \r\n  by asserting Hill's failure to return for a follow-up appointment as a defense. \r\n  The testimony was a proper response to Davis's assertion that the applicable \r\n  standard of care changed because Hill failed to return for her appointment. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, contrary to Davis's \r\n  argument in his brief, neither physician stated a legal conclusion. The testimony \r\n  elicited from both witnesses established only: (1) that the standard of care \r\n  required of a family practice physician remains the same even if a patient fails \r\n  to do certain things that could have enabled the physician to correct a breach \r\n  of that standard; and (2) that Davis's responsibility to read and follow up \r\n  on all tests reports was not contingent on anything Hill should have done and \r\n  neglected to do.  \r\n   \r\nDavis also contends the trial court \r\n  erred in denying his motion to strike the testimony of one of Haselden's expert \r\n  witnesses because the witness allegedly testified incorrectly that the standard \r\n  of care was perfection.(20) The testimony, however, \r\n  was elicited by Davis's own attorney on cross-examination; therefore, this argument \r\n  is without merit.(21) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n5. Qualification of Expert Witness \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis alleges the trial court erred \r\n  in qualifying Simone Sommer, M.D., as an expert in family practice because Sommer \r\n  no longer practiced in that area. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe qualification of an expert witness \r\n  is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.(22) \r\n  The South Carolina Rules of Evidence allow a witness to be qualified as an expert \r\n  based on knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.(23) \r\n  There is no requirement that the expert must work in the same field or area \r\n  of practice in order to be properly qualified in that area.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSommer testified she was a family \r\n  physician. She graduated from George Washington Medical Center and trained at \r\n  Duke University in the Department of Family Medicine. Sommer also served as \r\n  a faculty member in the University of North Carolina's Department of Family \r\n  Medicine. Sommer was therefore qualified to testify as an expert in the field \r\n  of family practice based on her education, experience, and training.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nD. Limitation of Medical Expenses \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDavis further argues the trial court \r\n  erred in declining to limit evidence of Hill's medical expenses to the amount \r\n  paid by Medicaid. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOver Davis's objection, Haselden \r\n  was permitted to introduce evidence that Hill incurred medical expenses in the \r\n  amount of $77,905.21. This total included $75,729.63 covering services for which \r\n  Medicaid paid $24,109.04.(24) The difference, \r\n  then, between the \"billed\" amounts and the amounts actually \"paid\" by Medicaid, \r\n  totaled $51,620.59.  \r\n   \r\nDavis argues on appeal that the trial \r\n  court should have limited Haselden's recovery for medical expenses to the amounts \r\n  that Medicaid actually paid for them.(25) In \r\n  support of his argument, he notes the medical care providers who accepted Medicaid \r\n  payments on Hill's behalf are prohibited from attempting to collect the difference \r\n  between the \"billed\" amounts and the \"paid\" amounts from her estate, and allowing \r\n  Haselden to claim the face amount of the bills would therefore result in a windfall \r\n  to the beneficiaries of Hill's estate.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn overruling Davis's objection, \r\n  the trial court cited the collateral source rule. When announcing its ruling, \r\n  however, the trial court also stated, \"And remember[,] that evidence is nothing \r\n  more than evidence of what is reasonable and appropriate charges for the services \r\n  rendered. It's not - and it's only evidence.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina has long followed \r\n  the collateral source rule.(26) Under this rule, \r\n  \"compensation received by an injured party from a source wholly independent \r\n  of the wrongdoer will not reduce the amount of damages owed by the wrongdoer.\"(27) \r\n  The policy behind the rule is that a benefit directed to an injured party should \r\n  not be shifted so as to result in a windfall for the tortfeasor.(28) \r\n  At times, then, \"while a plaintiff's recovery under the ordinary negligence \r\n  rule is limited to damages which will make him whole, the collateral source \r\n  rule allows a plaintiff further recovery under certain circumstances even though \r\n  he has suffered no loss.\"(29) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis argues the amount Medicaid \r\n  paid to discharge the various medical expenses Hill incurred is conclusive evidence \r\n  of the reasonable value of medical services that she received. He contends this \r\n  amount is conclusive because a Medicaid provider may not seek reimbursement \r\n  from the patient for any amount over and above the Medicaid payment.(30) \r\n  We disagree with this argument.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe are aware that cases from other \r\n  jurisdictions have considered whether write-offs of unsatisfied charges for \r\n  medical services covered by Medicaid constitute a collateral source.(31) \r\n  It is our view, however, that the issue here, as presented to the trial court, \r\n  does not involve the collateral source rule so much as it does the question \r\n  of whether evidence of the total amounts billed for services for which Medicaid \r\n  made a partial payment was properly admitted to prove damages. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"It is a fundamental principle of \r\n  the law of damages that a person who suffers personal injuries because of the \r\n  negligence of another is entitled to recover the reasonable value of medical \r\n  care and expenses incurred for the treatment of the injuries to the time of \r\n  trial . . . .\"(32) Furthermore, \"recovery for \r\n  medical expenses is, as a rule, controlled by what the services rendered were \r\n  reasonably worth and not by what was actually paid or contracted to be paid.\"(33) \r\n  We hold the amount Medicaid paid toward Hill's medical treatment is only one \r\n  measure of the reasonable value of the corresponding services that she received.(34) \r\n  We therefore affirm the trial court's decision to allow Haselden to introduce \r\n  evidence of the costs that Hill would have had to pay for her treatment if she \r\n  had not been a Medicaid patient.(35) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nE. Jury Instructions \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis next asserts the trial court \r\n  erred in declining his request for a jury instruction limiting the claim for \r\n  Hill's claim for conscious pain and suffering from the time she discovered she \r\n  had cancer to the time of her death.(36) We \r\n  disagree. Davis's testimony indicated Hill suffered pain and problems with her \r\n  breast in 1991 and felt a lump in her breast off and on for several months before \r\n  her June 1993 visit. Based on this testimony, the jury could conclude Hill had \r\n  suffered even before she became aware of the serious nature of her illness. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nF. Mortality Tables \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis additionally argues the court \r\n  erred in permitting the jury to use the South Carolina mortality tables in the \r\n  absence of any evidence that Hill could have lived to her full life expectancy. \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nThe trial court charged the jury \r\n  as follows:  \r\n   \r\nIn determining how long the decedent \r\n  would have lived, had the decedent lived a normal life, you may consider \r\n  her life expectancy at the time of her death. The mortality table received in \r\n  evidence may be considered in your determining how long the plaintiff may be \r\n  expected to live. Such tables are not binding on you but may be considered \r\n  together with other evidence in the case bearing on the plaintiff's health, \r\n  age and physical condition before the injury and death in determining the probable \r\n  length of the plaintiff's life. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIf you find that this defendant was \r\n  not negligent towards this plaintiff or rather the plaintiff decedent or that \r\n  the actions were not the proximate cause in the case of the plaintiff's injuries, \r\n  then you should disregard this table and the plaintiff's life expectancy. (emphases \r\n  added). \r\n   \r\nA jury charge that is substantially \r\n  correct when read as a whole and adequately covers the law does not require \r\n  reversal.(37) Regarding the use of mortality \r\n  tables in litigation, the legislature has provided: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen it is necessary, in any civil \r\n  action or other mode of litigation, to establish the life expectancy of any \r\n  person from any period in his life, whether he be living at the time or not, \r\n  the table below shall be received in all courts and by all persons having power \r\n  to determine litigation as evidence (along with other evidence as to his \r\n  health, constitution and habits) of the life expectancy of such person.(38) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn addition, the supreme court has \r\n  held, \"It is proper to charge the mortality tables in a personal injury action \r\n  when there is evidence of permanent injury.\"(39) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the jurors were advised they \r\n  were not bound by the mortality table in determining Hill's life expectancy. \r\n  In addition, there was evidence as to Hill's chance of survival if her cancer \r\n  had been treated in 1991. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the \r\n  trial court's instruction regarding the jury's use of the mortality table. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nG. Thirteenth Juror \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDavis contends the trial court erred \r\n  in declining his motion for a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine. \r\n  We find no error. \r\n   \r\n\"Under the 'thirteenth juror doctrine,' \r\n  a trial judge may grant a new trial absolute when he finds the evidence does \r\n  not justify the verdict. This ruling has also been termed a granting of a new \r\n  trial upon the facts.\"(40)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion \r\n  for a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, we consider only whether \r\n  there is any evidence to support the trial court's decision.(41) \r\n  To reverse such a denial, we must find the moving party was entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict at trial.(42) As discussed above, there \r\n  was expert testimony to support a finding that the proximate cause of Hill's \r\n  premature death was Davis's failure to timely read and act on her 1991 mammogram. \r\n  We therefore uphold the trial court's refusal to grant a new trial under the \r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n1.  318 S.C. 72, \r\n  456 S.E.2d 371 (1995). \r\n2.

On appeal, \r\n  Davis argues Singer's testimony falls short of satisfying the \"most probably\" \r\n  rule because it was \"premised on statistics\" and because \"Singer admitted the \r\n  only way to prognosticate specifically in Mrs. Hill's case was if a biopsy had \r\n  been done.\" We find no merit to this argument. In our view, the fact that an \r\n  expert opinion may be premised on statistics affects the weight rather than \r\n  the competency of this evidence. Cf. Clark v. Ross, 284 S.C. 543, \r\n  328 S.E.2d 91 (Ct.

The \r\n  question of whether or not the jury should have been given access to the information \r\n  in this letter is not before us.

Â§ \r\n  1396a(a)(13)(A) (1992) (emphasis added). Subparagraph (A) was substantially \r\n  rewritten in 1997. The South Carolina Supreme Court has recognized that providers \r\n  do not always recover their out-of-pocket costs when they provide services under \r\n  the Medicaid program. See Anco, Inc. v. State Health and Human Servs. \r\n  Fin. Comm'n, 300 S.C. 432, 438, 388 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1989) (\"Under the efficient \r\n  cost standard, states are not required to reimburse individual providers for \r\n  costs actually or reasonably incurred.\"). The possibility that a provider may \r\n  actually incur losses for services paid by Medicaid would make it unfair to \r\n  hold that the amount of the Medicaid payments is the deciding factor in determining \r\n  the reasonable value of those services. \r\n35.  In his brief, \r\n  Davis cites Bates v. Hogg, 921 P.2d 249 (Kan. Ct. App.), review denied, \r\n  260 Kan. 991 (1996), in which the Kansas Court of Appeals, in a divided opinion, \r\n  held that the appropriate measure of damages was the amount actually paid by \r\n  Medicaid on the injured plaintiff's behalf. Although there are striking factual \r\n  parallels to the present case, we hold Bates is distinguishable. Kansas \r\n  administrative regulations provide that \"the amount allowed by Medicaid becomes \r\n  the amount due and is the 'customary charge' under the circumstances we have \r\n  before us.\" Bates, 921 P.2d at 253; see also Kan. Admin.

When she stepped \r\n  onto the escalator, Gazes had the slacks in a plastic grocery bag looped around \r\n  her left wrist, a pocketbook on her left shoulder, and a cane in her right hand. \r\n  Gazes placed her left hand or wrist onto the escalator's handrail. As Gazes \r\n  rode the escalator to approximately the fourth or fifth step, she was jerked \r\n  to the left and pulled off her feet. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nImmediately after her fall, Gazes \r\n  told Mark Vermillion, a Dillard's employee and eyewitness, that her bag got \r\n  caught, causing her to fall. The next day, Vermillion gave a statement that \r\n  \"[Gazes] was having trouble with her left hand, that there was something, either \r\n  a bag or something, catching.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGazes subsequently filed this suit \r\n  against Dillard's. Dillard's denied liability and filed a third party complaint \r\n  against Schindler Elevator Corporation, which allegedly designed, manufactured, \r\n  installed, inspected, and maintained the escalator.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPrior to trial, but over three years \r\n  after the incident, Vermillion testified in his deposition that Gazes's plastic \r\n  bag was catching on the inside of the escalator's handrail. However, Vermillion \r\n  also testified he did not see Gazes start to fall and that when he first observed \r\n  her, she was already spinning to the left. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Gazes attempted to introduce \r\n  the expert testimony of Del L. Krause, an accident reconstructionist, to offer \r\n  his opinion that Gazes's plastic bag was traveling outside, rather than inside, \r\n  the escalator's handrail which caused her to fall when the bag became trapped \r\n  between the handrail and a closely situated column. Krause based his opinion \r\n  on an interview with Gazes, an inspection of the accident scene, and black marks \r\n  on the plastic bag consistent with rubber on the escalator's handrail. Krause \r\n  would have opined that the proximity of the columns and the escalator's handrail, \r\n  without some means of preventing a bag from becoming entangled, created a dangerous \r\n  hazard and Dillard's should have recognized this situation as a risk to its \r\n  customers' safety. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court refused to admit \r\n  Krause's testimony under Rules 702 and 703 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, \r\n  concluding that Krause's opinion lacked the proper factual basis because there \r\n  had been no evidence presented that the plastic bag was on the outside of the \r\n  escalator's handrail. The court reasoned that if the bag were on the outside \r\n  of the escalator's handrail, Gazes would have noticed, and since she did not \r\n  recall the bag being on the outside of the handrail, it must have been on the \r\n  inside.  \r\n   \r\nGazes also offered the testimony \r\n  of Leonard Greene, a forensic engineer, to establish the cause of her fall. \r\n  Greene examined the escalator and reviewed Gazes's deposition testimony that \r\n  she fell when she reached the fourth for fifth step on the escalator. He noted \r\n  that the escalator and column were only five inches apart at the location of \r\n  Gazes's initial fall, creating a \"pinch point.\" Greene testified that pinch \r\n  points are expected with escalators and are usually guarded against through \r\n  the installation of devices designed to prevent objects from being caught in \r\n  them. However, no such protections were installed at this pinch point.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough the court permitted Greene's \r\n  testimony concerning the pinch point and the use of guards to protect against \r\n  such hazards, it refused to admit his opinion, that to a reasonable degree of \r\n  engineering certainty, the most probable cause of Gazes's fall was the bag becoming \r\n  trapped between the escalator's handrail and the column. The court excluded \r\n  the evidence under Rule 403 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. The court \r\n  also excluded Greene's answer to a hypothetical question regarding the accident's \r\n  cause. The court reasoned Greene's answer, that the fall was precipitated by \r\n  the bag becoming caught between the escalator's handrail and the column, was \r\n  not supported by the evidence and therefore the answer amounted to improper \r\n  speculation. \r\n   \r\nAfter Gazes rested her case, the \r\n  trial court directed a verdict in favor of Dillard's and Schindler. This appeal \r\n  follows.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Expert \r\n  Testimony  \r\n   \r\nGazes contends the trial court erred \r\n  in excluding Krause's and Greene's testimony regarding the cause of Gazes's \r\n  accident. Specifically, Gazes contends a sufficient factual basis existed to \r\n  support the experts' opinions. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decision to admit or exclude \r\n  expert testimony rests within the trial court's sound discretion and will not \r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. Payton v. Kearse, 329 \r\n  S.C. 51, 60-61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211 (1998); Hundley v. Rite Aid, Op. \r\n  No. 3126 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 28, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. 8 at 28). Rules \r\n  702 and 703 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence provide guidelines for the \r\n  admissibility of expert testimony. Rule 702 provides that a qualified expert \r\n  may testify when \"scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge will assist \r\n  the trier of fact . . . to determine a fact in issue.\" Rule 702, SCRE. Rule \r\n  703 states: \r\n   \r\nThe facts or data in the particular \r\n  case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived \r\n  by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably \r\n  relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences \r\n  upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 703, SCRE. Furthermore, even \r\n  if an expert's testimony is admissible under Rule 703, SCRE, the trial judge \r\n  may exclude the testimony based on Rule 403, SCRE. State v. Slocumb, \r\n  336 S.C. 619, 627-28, 521 S.E.2d 507, 511-12 (Ct. App. 1999); see also Rule \r\n  403, SCRE (\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value \r\n  is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of \r\n  the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste \r\n  of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Krause's \r\n  Testimony \r\n   \r\nIn excluding Krause's testimony, \r\n  the court did not question the reliability of accident reconstruction science \r\n  or Krause's expertise in the field. Instead, the court based its ruling on an \r\n  alleged lack of factual support for Krause's opinion that the plastic bag traveled \r\n  on the outside of the escalator's handrail. We find the trial court abused its \r\n  discretion in excluding Krause's testimony. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder Rule 703, SCRE, an expert may \r\n  base his or her opinion on inadmissible evidence if the evidence is \"of a type \r\n  reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions \r\n  or inferences upon the subject.\" Rule 703, SCRE. Krause based his opinion on \r\n  an interview with Gazes, an investigation of the accident scene, and an inspection \r\n  of the black marks on the plastic bag Gazes was carrying. Interviewing the victim \r\n  of an accident, investigating the accident scene, and inspecting physical evidence \r\n  from the accident is exactly the type of evidence commonly relied upon by accident \r\n  reconstructionists.  \r\n   \r\nMoreover, the evidence presented \r\n  at trial also provided a sufficient factual basis for Krause's opinion. Gazes \r\n  testified to her location at the time she fell and the proximity of the escalator \r\n  and the column. There was also testimony that Gazes's plastic bag had black \r\n  marks on it after the incident. Furthermore, one witness testified that he stuck \r\n  a piece of paper into the handrail and when he removed the paper, it was marked \r\n  with what appeared to be the same black substance as found on the bag. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTherefore, we find there was evidence \r\n  to provide a sufficient factual basis for Krause's opinion. In fact, it is exactly \r\n  this type of situation, where direct evidence of an accident's cause is scant \r\n  and in dispute, that testimony from an accident reconstructionist can assist \r\n  the trier of fact in \"determin[ing] a fact in issue.\" Rule 702, SCRE. The existence \r\n  of evidence that the plastic bag was on the inside of the escalator's handrail \r\n  and the limited amount of evidence for Krause to form an opinion may affect \r\n  the weight to be accorded Krause's testimony but not its admissibility.(1) \r\n  See Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 470, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  835, 846 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"Where the expert's testimony is based upon facts \r\n  sufficient to form the basis for an opinion, the trier of fact determines its \r\n  probative value.\"). \r\n   \r\nB. Greene's \r\n  Testimony \r\n   \r\nAlthough the court permitted Greene's \r\n  testimony concerning the \"pinch point\" created by the escalator's handrail and \r\n  the column, the court refused to admit his opinion as to the most probable cause \r\n  of Gazes's fall. The trial court excluded the evidence under Rule 403, SCRE.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Dillard's and Schindler \r\n  argued against the admission of Greene's opinion on the ground that Greene's \r\n  testimony concerning the most probable cause for Gazes's fall exceeded a forensic \r\n  engineer's expertise. However, the court found a forensic engineer \"could probably\" \r\n  testify to the cause of an accident. Furthermore, the trial court earlier found \r\n  Greene qualified to testify as a forensic engineer. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, we agree with the trial \r\n  court that under the circumstances present in this case, Greene would be qualified \r\n  to testify to causation because a forensic engineer's expertise would assist \r\n  the trier of fact in determining causation, a fact in issue. See Rule \r\n  702, SCRE. Furthermore, under the same analysis employed regarding Krause's \r\n  testimony, we find Greene's review of Vermillion's testimony and Krause's deposition, \r\n  together with Greene's inspection of the accident scene and the plastic bag, \r\n  provide a sufficient factual basis for Greene to express an opinion on the cause \r\n  of Gazes's fall. \r\n   \r\nFinally, we find the trial court \r\n  erred in excluding Greene's answer to the hypothetical question concerning the \r\n  cause of Gazes's fall. An expert's opinion testimony may be based upon a hypothetical \r\n  question. Gathers v. South Carolina Elec. and Gas Co., 311 S.C. 81, 82, \r\n  427 S.E.2d 687, 688 (Ct. App. 1993). Even though the hypothetical question must \r\n  be based on facts supported by the evidence, counsel may pose the hypothetical \r\n  \"on any theory which can reasonably be deduced from the evidence and select \r\n  as a predicate for it such facts as the evidence proves or reasonably tends \r\n  to prove.\" Id. at 82-83, 427 S.E.2d at 688. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGazes's counsel posed the following \r\n  hypothetical question to Greene: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI want you to assume that Mrs. Gazes \r\n  entered that escalator that you took a picture of, that her fall took place \r\n  four to six [steps] up the escalator, that her bag or that bag, that Piggly \r\n  Wiggly bag, was caught on something, that she came to rest four to six [steps] \r\n  up on the escalator, that Mr. Vermillion, the man who turned the escalator off \r\n  and who did come to her assistance, states in his deposition and in his statement \r\n  that he gave a day or two after the accident, that something was caught, referring \r\n  to Mrs. Gazes' stopping on the escalator. Assuming those facts and that there's \r\n  no reflection that she had no complete balance up to the stopping when she stopped, \r\n  would you have an opinion as to what precipitated that stop and that fall of \r\n  Mrs. Gazes? \r\n   \r\nIn response, Greene would have opined \r\n  that Gazes fell because her bag caught between the escalator's handrail and \r\n  the column. The trial court found this dialogue would be inconsistent with the \r\n  evidence presented at trial. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, there was testimony that \r\n  Gazes fell at approximately the fourth or fifth step on the escalator, \r\n  the escalator's handrail was located close to a column, and after her fall the \r\n  plastic bag had black marks on it. Greene testified that the escalator handrail \r\n  and the column were only approximately five inches apart at the pinch point. \r\n  Greene also testified that the handrail could cause a bag hanging on a person's \r\n  wrist to rise to the top of the handrail and then fall to either side. We find \r\n  this evidence sufficient to support the hypothetical question and Greene's response. \r\n  Therefore, we find the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the hypothetical \r\n  question and Greene's response. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Directed \r\n  Verdict \r\n   \r\nGazes argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting the respondents' motion for directed verdict. In light of our rulings \r\n  on the expert testimony, we hold a directed verdict was inappropriate. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict \r\n  motion, the trial court must consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Swinton Creek Nursery \r\n  v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999). \r\n  Where only one inference can be drawn from the evidence, the motion must be \r\n  granted. Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, \r\n  333 S.C. 71, 88, 508 S.E.2d 565, 574 (1998). However, where more than one reasonable \r\n  inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the \r\n  jury. Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 \r\n  (1998). \r\n   \r\nBased on our holding that both Krause's \r\n  and Greene's testimony should have been admitted, and viewing the evidence in \r\n  the light most favorable to Gazes, there is more than one reasonable inference \r\n  from the evidence as to the cause of Gazes's fall. Therefore, the trial court \r\n  erred in granting Dillard's and Schindler a directed verdict. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the reasons discussed above, \r\n  the trial court's order granting the respondents a directed verdict is reversed \r\n  and the case is remanded for a new trial. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n1. \r\n It should be noted that Gazes \r\noffered Krause's testimony a second time after Greene testified and Vermillion's \r\ndeposition was admitted as a court exhibit, thus providing additional facts to \r\nsupport Krause's opinion. Specifically, Greene testified that the design and operation \r\nof the handrail created the potential for a bag being carried underneath one's \r\nwrist to move onto the top of the handrail and then fall down either side. Nevertheless, \r\nthe trial court again excluded Krause's testimony. \r\n2.  \r\n  The trial judge explicitly stated he was excluding this portion of Greene's \r\n  testimony based on Rule 403, SCRE, rather than on the ground he excluded Krause's \r\n  testimony-an opinion without evidentiary support. However, the trial court never \r\n  stated how Greene's testimony violated Rule 403, SCRE. Instead, the court stated, \r\n  \"there's nothing in the record to support\" Greene's opinion. Therefore, although \r\n  not explicit, it appears the trial court found Greene's testimony would \"mislead[] \r\n  the jury\" to such an extent that the probative value of Greene's testimony would \r\n  be substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3200","title":"F &amp; D Electrical Contractors, Inc. v.

Wade Mullins, III, of \r\n          Bruner, Powell, Robbins, Wall &amp; Mullins, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J.: In \r\n  this action to foreclose a mechanic's lien, BG Holding Company (Owner) appeals \r\n  the denial of its motion for a directed verdict and the trial court's award \r\n  of attorney fees and costs to F&amp;D Contractors, Inc. (F&amp;D). We reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPowder Coaters, Inc. (Renter) leased \r\n  a portion of Owner's warehouse to operate a business that electrostatically \r\n  coats metal parts with dry powder paint. In order to operate its business, Renter \r\n  contracted with F&amp;D to perform an electrical upfit on the leased portion \r\n  of the warehouse. Although F&amp;D performed the upfit, valued at $8,264.00, \r\n  Renter never paid for the work.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nF&amp;D then filed and sought to \r\n  foreclose on a mechanic's lien against the warehouse. At a jury trial on the \r\n  foreclosure action, Bruce Houston, Renter's president and owner, testified that \r\n  before entering into the lease he discussed the warehouse's existing lighting \r\n  conditions with Mark Taylor, Owner's leasing agent and property manager. Although \r\n  Houston testified Renter would not have entered into the lease had it not been \r\n  able to perform an electrical upfit to improve the warehouse's lighting, he \r\n  also admitted that even Renter did not know the extent of the necessary modifications \r\n  when the parties signed the lease.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHouston also testified he thought \r\n  an addendum to the lease specifically authorized Renter to have the electrical \r\n  upfit performed. However, Houston conceded Renter had no authorization to bind \r\n  Owner to pay for the improvements.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the conclusion of F&amp;D's case, \r\n  Owner moved for a directed verdict, arguing the evidence failed to establish \r\n  the requisite element of consent under the mechanic's lien statute. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (1991). The trial court denied the motion. At the \r\n  close of evidence, Owner renewed its motion for a directed verdict. The trial \r\n  court again denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned \r\n  a verdict for F&amp;D in the amount of $8,264.00. The trial court awarded F&amp;D \r\n  costs and attorney fees in the amount of $8,264.00. Owner appeals. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\n When ruling on a motion for directed \r\n  verdict, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the \r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party. Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto \r\n  Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999). However, \r\n  when the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict for the moving \r\n  party is proper. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn action to foreclose a mechanic's \r\n  lien is an action at law. Adams v. B&amp;D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, 420, \r\n  377 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1989). In an action at law tried by a jury, our jurisdiction \r\n  is limited to correcting errors of law, and a jury's factual findings will not \r\n  be disturbed on appeal unless a review of the record discloses that there is \r\n  no evidence reasonably supporting those findings. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. \r\n  City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Owner contends F&amp;D \r\n  is not entitled to a mechanic's lien on the warehouse because F&amp;D failed \r\n  to establish Owner furnished the consent required by South Carolina Code Section \r\n  29-5-10(a) (1991). We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 29-5-10 permits a laborer \r\n  to obtain a lien upon a building when the laborer performs the work \"by virtue \r\n  of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of the building.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (1991). There is no dispute that F&amp;D and Owner never entered \r\n  into an express agreement. Therefore, this appeal centers on the meaning of \r\n  the term \"consent\" as used in section 29-5-10. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNeither party presented any South \r\n  Carolina case construing section 29-5-10 in the landlord-tenant context, and \r\n  our research revealed none. Nevertheless, the supreme court has consistently \r\n  construed the consent required by section 29-5-10 as \"something more than a \r\n  mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence. It implies an agreement \r\n  to that which, but for the consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting \r\n  has a right to forbid.\" Geddes v. Bowden, 19 S.C. 1, 7 (1883) (quoting \r\n  Gray v. Walker, 16 S.C. 143, 147 (1881)); see also Trico \r\n  Surveying, Inc. v. Godley Auction Co., 314 S.C. 542, 545, 431 S.E.2d 565, \r\n  566 (1993); C&amp;B Co. v. Collins, 269 S.C. 688, 690, 239 S.E.2d 725, \r\n  726 (1977); Guignard Brick Works v. Gantt, 251 S.C. 29, 32, 159 S.E.2d \r\n  850, 851 (1968); Metz v. Critcher, 86 S.C. 348, 350, 68 S.E. 627, 628 \r\n  (1910).  \r\n   \r\nIn Collins, an owner executed \r\n  a contract with a builder. 269 S.C. at 690, 239 S.E.2d at 725. The builder selected \r\n  a supplier and allowed the owner to choose particular items from the supplier's \r\n  stock. Id. In an affidavit, the owner stated her latitude of choice extended \r\n  only to selecting particular items and not to selecting who supplied the items. \r\n  Id. at 690, 239 S.E.2d at 726. Although the supreme court reversed an \r\n  order granting the owner summary judgment, the court noted the statements in \r\n  the owner's affidavit, if established at trial, only constituted mere acquiescence \r\n  and would be insufficient to satisfy the consent requirement of section 29-5-10. \r\n  Id. \r\n   \r\nThe Collins case illustrates \r\n  that merely recognizing a builder will utilize sub-contractors or acknowledging \r\n  the builder's selection of a sub-contractor is insufficient to establish the \r\n  consent required under section 29-5-10. Therefore, under our reading of section \r\n  29-5-10 and the relevant supreme court precedent, to subject an owner's property \r\n  to a lien in the construction context, the sub-contractor seeking the lien must \r\n  establish the owner did more than merely acknowledge, after the fact, who the \r\n  builder selected as the sub-contractor. See Metz, 86 S.C. 348, \r\n  68 S.E. 627 (1910) (upholding a directed verdict and holding the owner merely \r\n  acquiesced because the owner never had the opportunity to object or consent \r\n  to the builder's selection of a supplier). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe same reasoning compels us to \r\n  conclude that consent in the landlord-tenant context requires more than the \r\n  lessor's mere recognition that the lessee will improve the leased property or \r\n  acknowledgment of the lessee's selection of the laborer to perform the improvement. \r\n  To subject the owner's property to a mechanic's lien when the owner merely acknowledges \r\n  the lessee's selection of a contractor effectively subjects the owner's \r\n  property to a lien for \"acquiesc[ing] in a state of things already in existence,\" \r\n  which the supreme court has repeatedly deemed insufficient to constitute the \r\n  consent required under section 29-5-10. See Collins, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis construction accords with the \r\n  statutory language. Neither F&amp;D nor Owner argues an \"agreement\" under section \r\n  29-5-10 can be between anyone other than the owner and the entity seeking the \r\n  mechanic's lien. It is only logical then that consent under section 29-5-10 \r\n  must also be between the owner and the entity seeking the lien, and this consent \r\n  requires more than the owner's acknowledgment of a tenant's selection of the \r\n  laborer who now seeks the mechanic's lien. To hold otherwise renders the owner \r\n  of a rental property the guarantor for a tenant's obligations without conforming \r\n  to the requirements generally needed for a valid guaranty. See TranSouth \r\n  Fin. Corp. v. Cochran, 324 S.C. 290, 295, 478 S.E.2d 63, 65-6 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996) (noting that a guarantor's liability is an independent contractual obligation \r\n  where the debtor is not a party to the guaranty, the guarantor is not a party \r\n  to the principal obligation, and the responsibilities imposed by the contract \r\n  of guaranty differ from those created by the contract to which the guaranty \r\n  is collateral (internal citation omitted)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA jurisdiction with a similar mechanic's \r\n  lien statute(2) has utilized the same analysis. \r\n  See Hall v. Peacock Fixture and Electric Co., 475 A.2d 1100, \r\n  1102 (Conn. 1984) (holding the \"mere granting of permission for work to be conducted \r\n  on one's property has never been deemed sufficient to support a mechanic's lien \r\n  against the property\"); see also St. Catherine's Church Corp of \r\n  Riverside v. Technical Planning Assocs., Inc., 520 A.2d 1298, 1299 (Conn. \r\n  App. Ct. 1987) (finding the consent required under the mechanic's lien statute \r\n  \"must be a consent that indicates an agreement that the owner of at least the \r\n  land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.\" (internal citation \r\n  omitted)). \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, viewing the \r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to F&amp;D, there is no evidence in the \r\n  record that Owner consented to the contract between Renter and F&amp;D as required \r\n  by the mechanic's lien statute and South Carolina case law. First, F&amp;D's \r\n  complaint never expressly alleged Owner consented to F&amp;D's contract with \r\n  Renter. Second, F&amp;D acknowledged that it was looking to Renter, not Owner, \r\n  to pay the bill and that F&amp;D never had any conversation with Owner prior \r\n  to performing the work. Third, while Renter's president asserted that the lease \r\n  and its addendum evidenced Owner's consent for Renter to perform the modifications, \r\n  Renter also acknowledged that it was not authorized to bind Owner to pay for \r\n  the modifications and presented no evidence that Owner did anything more than \r\n  acknowledge Renter's selection of F&amp;D to perform the upfit. Furthermore, \r\n  the lease states that \"[i]f the Lessee should make any [alterations, modifications, \r\n  additions, or installations], the Lessee hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, \r\n  and save harmless the Lessor from any liability which may devolve upon the Lessor \r\n  as a consequence thereof.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, although F&amp;D contends \r\n  the addendum to the lease between Owner and Renter evidenced Owner's consent \r\n  to the electrical upfit, there is nothing in the addendum indicating Owner did \r\n  anything other than acknowledge Renter's selection of F&amp;D as the contractor \r\n  to perform the upfit or that Owner had the authority to forbid Renter from selecting \r\n  a particular contractor. See Collins, 269 S.C. at 690. Acknowledging \r\n  Renter's selection of a contractor amounts to, at most, \"acquiesc[ing] in a \r\n  state of things already in existence.\" See Collins, 269 S.C. \r\n  at 690, 239 S.E.2d at 726; see also Geddes, 19 S.C. at 7; Metz, \r\n  86 S.C. at 350, 68 S.E. at 628. Therefore, F&amp;D failed to present evidence \r\n  Owner consented as required under section 29-5-10 and the court erred in denying \r\n  Owner's motion for directed verdict. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nF&amp;D also asserts Owner's leasing \r\n  agent witnessed the electrical work in progress and thereby consented, as Owner's \r\n  agent, by failing to object to it after the fact. We disagree. The mere presence \r\n  of Owner's agent at the construction site during construction at most amounts \r\n  to acquiescence and is insufficient to constitute consent because mere acquiescence \r\n  to an event which has already happened or begun cannot constitute consent. See \r\n  Collins, 269 S.C. at 690, 239 S.E.2d at 726 (noting that consent means \r\n  \"something more than a mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence.\"); \r\n  see also Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. \r\n  137, 142-3, 399 S.E.2d 430, 433 (Ct. App. 1990) (noting an agency relationship \r\n  may not be established solely by the declarations and conduct of an alleged \r\n  agent absent any indication of an agency relationship from the principal), rev'd \r\n  on other grounds, 313 S.C. 412, 438 S.E.2d 248 (1993); Hall, 475 \r\n  A.2d at 1102 (noting a lessee is not an agent for the owner merely by virtue \r\n  of the landlord-tenant relationship). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEven if the consent required under \r\n  section 29-5-10 is satisfied by Owner merely authorizing Renter to modify the \r\n  warehouse, as argued by F&amp;D, we still find the record insufficient to withstand \r\n  Owner's motion for directed verdict. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nF&amp;D asserts an addendum to the \r\n  lease between Owner and Renter evidenced Owner's consent to the upfit. The addendum \r\n  states \"Lessor shall allow Lessee to put Office Trailer in Building. All Utilities \r\n  necessary to handle Lessee's equipment shall be paid for by Lessee including, \r\n  but not limited to electricity, water, sewer, gas.\" Contrary to F&amp;D's argument, \r\n  there is no reasonable construction of this language that establishes Owner \r\n  agreed to allow Renter to electrically upfit the warehouse. The plain language \r\n  of the addendum indicates Renter is required to pay for the utilities associated \r\n  with the trailer, which accords with paragraph four of lessee's obligations \r\n  under the lease. See Cullum Mechanical Constr., Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Baptist Hosp., 336 S.C. 423, 520 S.E.2d 809 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting that \r\n  when contractual language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines \r\n  the contract's effect).  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, in light of the specificity \r\n  of other addendum provisions, which, for example, provided for a partition and \r\n  a rollup door, it strains credulity to suggest that this general provision, \r\n  which merely required Renter to pay for electricity, water, sewer, and gas, \r\n  authorized Renter to perform an electrical upfit. In fact, Renter's president \r\n  admitted even he did not know the extent of the necessary modifications when \r\n  entering the lease. Therefore, it is inconceivable that Owner both knew the \r\n  extent of the modifications and consented to the electrical upfit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Finally, the mere fact that Owner \r\n  may be realizing some continued benefit from the modifications, although this \r\n  is far from certain, is insufficient to entitle F&amp;D to a mechanic's lien. \r\n  See Guignard Brick Works, 251 S.C. at 32, 159 S.E.2d at 851-2 \r\n  (holding the supplier could not obtain a mechanic's lien on owner's property \r\n  even when owner used the materials provided by supplier with the knowledge that \r\n  the builder had not paid supplier for the materials). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe therefore find the record in the \r\n  instant case devoid of evidence of consent as required by section 29-5-10. Accordingly, \r\n  we hold the trial court erred in denying Owner's motion for directed verdict. \r\n  Because we reverse on this issue, F&amp;D is not entitled to the award of attorney \r\n  fees and costs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor all the above reasons, the judgment \r\n  below is  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMOREHEAD, A.J., concurs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J., dissents in \r\n  a separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTILWELL, J. (dissenting): \r\n  I respectfully and reluctantly dissent. Attempting to apply the mechanic's lien \r\n  statute in a landlord-tenant context presents vexing problems not normally encountered \r\n  in the typical mechanic's lien case. The primary reason for this, in my view, \r\n  is that while the mechanic's lien statute necessarily contemplates agreements \r\n  between parties, or consents by a party, the entire scheme is more in rem \r\n  than it is in personam. The primary focus of the action is against the \r\n  property that has been improved. Even when no agreement or consent is found, \r\n  courts have historically allowed the unpaid mechanic or materialman to tap an \r\n  existing fund for payment. See Metz v. Critcher, 83 S.C. 396, \r\n  65 S.E. 394 (1909). In this case, and I suppose in all landlord-tenant cases, \r\n  there is no fund available for either a general contractor or subcontractor \r\n  to access for payment. \r\n   \r\nI think this case is a matter for \r\n  the jury because of key language in the statute that gives the laborer a lien \r\n  upon the building if his work is done \"by consent of the owner . . . \r\n  or a person having authority from . . . the owner.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  29-5-10(a) (1991) (emphasis added). The phrase \"consent of\" must contemplate \r\n  something different and less formal than \"an agreement,\" otherwise the legislature \r\n  would not have included it in the statute. The majority opinion reasons that \r\n  the consent necessary to satisfy the statute must come directly from the owner \r\n  to the entity seeking the lien, a position which overlooks the express language \r\n  of the statute. It is respectfully submitted that if the consent was given directly \r\n  by the owner, that would amount to an express agreement for the work to be performed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is abundant evidence in the \r\n  record from which the jury could conclude that the landlord consented to the \r\n  work being done. The renter testified that but for the upgrade in the electrical, \r\n  they would not have rented the facility because of the inadequacy of the existing \r\n  electrical components. Even if the lease does not specifically authorize the \r\n  performance of the work, it at least contemplates that modifications would be \r\n  made, otherwise there would be no reason for the lease to contain an indemnification \r\n  and hold harmless agreement. Clearly, the landlord had the authority to forbid \r\n  any upfit, but did not do so. This is not a case where there was mere acquiescence \r\n  in a state of things already in existence. It is a case where the consent was \r\n  given prior to the work being done. The emphasis of the statute, in my judgment, \r\n  is directed toward consenting to the work, not to the specific workman. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI do not believe the case of C \r\n  &amp; B Co. v. Collins,(3) which the majority \r\n  relies upon for the proposition that to subject the owner's property to a lien \r\n  the owner must play a role in actually selecting the specific laborer seeking \r\n  the lien is particularly helpful here. The case was in an entirely different \r\n  posture on appeal than the current case. In Collins, the trial court \r\n  had granted summary judgment to the materialman. The supreme court, in reversing, \r\n  found that the question of consent was a factual issue to be decided by the \r\n  jury.  \r\n   \r\nI believe that there was a jury issue \r\n  involved in the instant case as well, and the jury has decided the issue. There \r\n  was sufficient evidence to submit the question of consent to the jury, and for \r\n  that reason I would affirm.\r\n1.  \r\nOwner ultimately evicted Renter \r\nfor nonpayment of rent. \r\n2.  The \r\n  Connecticut mechanic's lien statute provides: \"If any person has a claim for \r\n  more than ten dollars for . . . services rendered . . . in the improvement of \r\n  any lot . . . and the claim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent \r\n  of the owner of the land. . . or of some person having authority form or rightfully \r\n  acting for the owner . . . then the plot of land is subject to the payment of \r\n  the claim.\" Conn.

Dale (Husband) appeals from a family court order finding him in contempt \r\n  of a 1990 equitable apportionment settlement and from the court's award of post-judgment \r\n  interest to Mozell S. Dale (Wife). We affirm in part and reverse and remand \r\n  in part. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nThis is the third time this case \r\n  has been before this court. Husband and Wife divorced in 1990 on the basis of \r\n  Husband's post-separation adultery. The family court awarded Wife $47,745.95 \r\n  in equitable division. The court order regarding the apportionment required \r\n  Husband to transfer to Wife, among other things, a $30,000 certificate of deposit \r\n  (CD) and its accrued interest.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWife appealed the court's initial \r\n  award of alimony and equitable division. This court affirmed the equitable apportionment \r\n  but remanded the alimony issue to the family court. See Dale v. \r\n  Dale, 93-UP-023 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 28, 1993) (Dale I). \r\n  The family court ultimately increased Wife's alimony and Husband then appealed \r\n  the retroactive application of this award. This court then reversed the family \r\n  court's finding of retroactivity. See Dale v. Dale, 95-UP-016 \r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 31, 1995) (Dale II). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1997, Wife moved the family court \r\n  to issue a rule to show cause as to why Husband was not in contempt for failing \r\n  to provide her with the $30,000 CD pursuant to the court's 1990 order. After \r\n  a hearing, the court found Husband in willful contempt based on his cashing \r\n  in the CD and converting the funds, plus accrued interest, to his own use. However, \r\n  the court allowed Husband a credit of $15,680.63 against the amount due to Wife \r\n  under the settlement.(1) This credit resulted \r\n  from Husband's monthly payments of $259.38 on Wife's mobile home mortgage from \r\n  June 1990 to July 1994, in addition to payments for taxes and insurance on the \r\n  home during this time period. Husband additionally made a lump-sum cash payment \r\n  of $18,455.41 in July 1994. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe court further required Husband \r\n  to pay Wife post-judgment interest on $34, 612.95 of the $47,745.95 equitable \r\n  apportionment.(2) The post-judgment interest \r\n  was to be calculated from July 1990 to August 1994 on $34,612.95 and from August \r\n  1994 to the time of payment on the remaining balance of $476.91 due under the \r\n  settlement. The court stated that Husband could purge himself of the contempt \r\n  finding \"by complying with other provisions of this Order,\" including payment \r\n  of the remaining $476.91 balance on the original equitable apportionment and \r\n  the award of post-judgment interest which as of the date of the hearing totaled \r\n  $22,190.88. \r\n   \r\nHusband appeals the finding of contempt \r\n  and the award of post-judgment interest to Wife. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n   \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Husband argues the family \r\n  court erred in 1) finding him in willful contempt; 2) awarding wife post-judgment \r\n  interest; 3) awarding Wife relief not requested in her complaint; and 4) failing \r\n  to credit him for his payments when calculating the post-judgment interest award. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStandard of \r\n  Review  \r\n   \r\nIn reviewing family court rulings, \r\n  this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999). However, this broad scope of review does not compel a reviewing \r\n  court to disregard the family court's findings. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Contempt \r\n  Finding \r\n   \r\nHusband first argues the family court \r\n  erred in finding him in contempt for cashing in the CD and retaining the money. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n   \r\n\"Contempt results from the willful \r\n  disobedience of a court order.\" Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, \r\n  197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989). The record before the court must \"clearly and \r\n  specifically\" exhibit the contemptuous conduct to sustain a finding of contempt. \r\n  Id. This court will reverse a trial judge's decision regarding contempt \r\n  only if it is without evidentiary support or is an abuse of discretion. Milgroom \r\n  v. McDaniel, 308 S.C. 5, 9, 416 S.E.2d 626, 628 (1992) (quoting Stone \r\n  v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840 (1988)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe 1990 equitable apportionment \r\n  decree provided that \"[t]he Wife shall receive . . . the Thirty Thousand \r\n  ($30, 000.00) Dollar certificate of deposit which is the severance pay.\" (emphasis \r\n  added) This court upheld that ruling. Dale I. Husband acknowledged at \r\n  the hearing Wife was to receive the CD per the terms of the June 1990 decree. \r\n  Nevertheless, Husband cashed in the CD and converted the funds to his own use. \r\n  Husband was unable to provide the court with the date he cashed in the CD. By \r\n  his action, Husband clearly violated the decree affirmed by this court in 1993. \r\n  Dale I. Husband contends his payment of Wife's mobile home loan payments, \r\n  taxes and insurance from June 1990 through July 1994 benefitted Wife and excused \r\n  his failure to follow the exact terms of the decree. Husband paid mortgage payments \r\n  totaling $12,969.00 for Wife, plus taxes and insurance. Thus, Husband avers \r\n  his behavior cannot be deemed to be in willful violation of the 1990 decree. \r\n  We disagree.  \r\n   \r\nPer the 1990 decree, Wife was entitled \r\n  to have the total amount of the CD, plus any accrued interest, in a lump sum. \r\n  Husband's actions deprived the Wife of the present value of that lump sum. Husband \r\n  was not free to substitute his own judgment for that of the court and to parcel \r\n  out the amount he owed Wife in small monthly payments occurring over a period \r\n  of years. Further, Husband's retention of the money over a period of years deprived \r\n  Wife of the opportunity to earn interest or an investment return on the money. \r\n  In contrast, Husband willfully retained this opportunity for himself despite \r\n  the court's order to turn over the CD. We therefore reject Husband's argument \r\n  that payment of Wife's mortgage for several years excused his failure to obey \r\n  the 1990 decree and find a preponderance of the evidence supports the family \r\n  court ruling Husband acted in willful contempt of the decree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Award \r\n  of Post-Judgment Interest \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHusband secondly argues the family \r\n  court erred in awarding Wife post-judgment interest during the pendency of her \r\n  appeal. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nIn Casey v. Casey, 311 S.C. \r\n  243, 245, 428 S.E.2d 714, 716 (1993), the supreme court determined fixed awards \r\n  of money for equitable distribution are treated the same as money judgments \r\n  awarded in legal actions. In support of his argument, Husband points to Barth \r\n  v. Barth, 293 S.C. 305, 360 S.E.2d 309 (1987) and Sears v. Fowler, \r\n  293 S.C. 43, 358 S.E.2d 574 (1987) for the proposition that \"[a] judgment creditor \r\n  who appeals based on the insufficiency of the verdict is not entitled to interest \r\n  during the pendency of the appeal when the verdict is later upheld.\" However, \r\n  our supreme court recently overruled Barth and Sears in Calhoun \r\n  v. Calhoun, Op. No. 25079 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 6, 2000) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 9, at 25-26). After noting its prior holdings in Barth and \r\n  Sears, the court stated:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[W]hen a money judgment is finalized, \r\n  whether in a lower court or an appellate court, the interest on that amount, \r\n  whether it has been modified upward or downward or remains \r\n  the same, runs from the date of the original judgment. To the extent this \r\n  new rule is inconsistent with prior case law, that case law is overruled. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCalhoun at 26 (emphasis ours). \r\n  In our view, this language clearly mandates a finding that Wife is entitled \r\n  to post-judgment interest on amounts owed her under the original decree regardless \r\n  of the fact her appeal of that amount was unsuccessful. The amount merely \"remained \r\n  the same\" as contemplated in the language of Calhoun. We therefore find \r\n  no error in the family court's decision to award post-judgment interest. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Award \r\n  of Relief Outside the Pleadings \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHusband also argues the family court \r\n  erred by awarding Wife relief which exceeded that requested in her complaint. \r\n  This argument is without merit. Wife's complaint contained the following prayer: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThat Plaintiff Mozell S. Dale is \r\n  further informed and believes that she is entitled to post-judgment interest \r\n  at the statutory rate of 14% per annum on the $18,445.41 payment from June of \r\n  1990 through March of 1995 when this payment was tendered and further entitled \r\n  to post-judgment interest at the statutory rate of 14% per annum on the remaining \r\n  amounts owed to her from June of 1990 through the date such payment(s) are made. \r\n  \r\nHusband argues that the request for \r\n  interest is limited to the $18,445.41 payment because the trial judge found \r\n  the majority of \"remaining amounts owed\" had already been paid. This is not \r\n  entirely accurate, as the family court found Husband still owed $476.91 at the \r\n  date of the hearing. Regardless, Calhoun dispensed with the requirement \r\n  of pleading interest in order to be entitled to it. See Calhoun \r\n  at 23-26 (finding Court of Appeals erred in denying petitioner post-judgment \r\n  interest because it was not pled and because request for interest in Rule 59 \r\n  motion was untimely). To the extent the trial judge awarded interest on the \r\n  $15,680.63 in payments Husband made, the error was in awarding interest on the \r\n  entire amount as will be discussed in the next issue, not in awarding interest \r\n  generally.  \r\n   \r\nIV. Credit \r\n  for Payments Against Post-Judgment Interest Award \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHusband lastly contends the family \r\n  court erred in not crediting payments he made towards the interest he owes Wife. \r\n  To the extent the court awarded post-judgment interest on the entire $15,680.63 \r\n  in payments from June 1990 to August 1994, we agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHusband made monthly payments on \r\n  Wife's mortgage during this time period, for which the family court allowed \r\n  him a $15,680.63 credit. The court then calculated post-judgment interest against \r\n  this entire amount coupled with remaining amounts owed to wife. Instead of calculating \r\n  the post-judgment interest award against this entire amount, the court should \r\n  have amortized the interest calculation over this period of time taking into \r\n  consideration Husband's monthly payments. This would result in the proper credit \r\n  to Husband for his payments toward the satisfaction of the equitable apportionment. \r\n  Because the record before this court is not completely clear as to the timing \r\n  and total amount of the monthly payments, we remand the case to the family court \r\n  for the proper calculation.(3)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThus, we affirm the portions of the \r\n  family court's order finding the husband in contempt and awarding post-judgment \r\n  interest, but we reverse and remand the family court's calculation of post-judgment \r\n  interest. On remand, the family court shall consider Husband's payments totaling \r\n  $15,680.63 during the June 1990 to August 1994 period and credit them against \r\n  the award of post-judgment interest. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART and REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n1.  Wife has not \r\n  appealed this credit which is now law of the case. See ML-Lee Acquisition \r\n  Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, \r\n  472 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling is law of the case and should not have \r\n  been reconsidered by Court of Appeals). \r\n2.  Included in \r\n  the $34,612.95 is the $15,680.63 credit the family court allowed due to the \r\n  mortgage payments, plus the $18,455.41 lump sum payment by husband in July 1994, \r\n  plus the remaining $476.91 balance as of August 1994. \r\n3.  Although the \r\n  amount of the monthly mortgage payment appears in the record, other payments \r\n  reflected by the total credit, and the dates on which they were made, are not \r\n  contained in our record. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3202","title":"Falk v.

Falk alleged Sadler acted negligently, breached \r\n  fiduciary duties, and maliciously used or abused the legal process during the \r\n  time Sadler served as guardian ad litem for Falk's children. The trial court \r\n  granted Sadler's motion for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), SCRCP, \r\n  finding Sadler was entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity. Falk appeals. \r\n  We reverse and remand for further proceedings. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFalk married Yoshihisa Murasawa in \r\n  Los Gatos, California on May 19, 1987. The couple adopted a son, Andrew Yoshi \r\n  Murasawa,(1) in New Jersey on December 9, 1994. \r\n  Falk then moved to Arkansas with Andrew for the purpose of adopting Murasawa's \r\n  biological daughter, Cara Cydney Jennings Murasawa, who was born to a surrogate \r\n  mother on March 6, 1995. Falk adopted Cara, with Murasawa's consent, at a final \r\n  adoption hearing on March 28, 1995. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn March 29, 1995, Falk and Murasawa \r\n  separated. Murasawa left Arkansas to return to Tokyo, Japan. Falk moved with \r\n  both children to Beaufort, South Carolina. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 10, 1995, Falk filed an \r\n  action in the Beaufort County family court for separate support and maintenance. \r\n  Falk sought temporary and permanent custody of both children and an equitable \r\n  division of the marital property. In her pleadings, she asked the family court \r\n  to appoint Sadler as the guardian ad litem for the children. \r\nMurasawa answered and joined in the \r\n  request that the family court appoint Sadler as the guardian ad litem. Murasawa \r\n  alleged that at the time he consented to Falk's adoption of Cara, Falk represented \r\n  to him that she and the children would return to Tokyo on or about April 12, \r\n  1995. Murasawa alleged Falk \"hid her secret plan and intention of separating \r\n  from [him] in order to induce [him] into consenting to [Falk's] adoption of \r\n  Cara Murasawa.\" Murasawa subsequently filed an action in Arkansas seeking to \r\n  nullify Falk's adoption of Cara. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 6, 1995, the Beaufort \r\n  County family court filed a pendente lite order of custody awarding Murasawa \r\n  temporary custody of Cara and awarding Falk temporary custody of Andrew. The \r\n  order required Murasawa to pay $5,000 per month in temporary support for Falk \r\n  and Andrew. The order allowed Murasawa to return to Tokyo with Cara if Murasawa \r\n  posted a $1,000,000 letter of credit with the court. The order also noted that \r\n  the guardian ad litem, Sadler, had recommended that the court place pendente \r\n  lite custody of Cara with Murasawa and allow him to return to Tokyo with Cara \r\n  upon posting the letter of credit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe family court filed a decree of \r\n  separate maintenance and support on October 10, 1996, which approved and incorporated \r\n  a property and separation agreement signed by Falk and Murasawa on August 16, \r\n  1996. The property and separation agreement stated Murasawa would have permanent \r\n  custody of Cara and Falk would have permanent custody of Andrew. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFalk filed this action against Sadler \r\n  \"in her capacity as Guardian ad Litem\" on August 25, 1997, asserting causes \r\n  of action for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and malicious use or abuse \r\n  of the legal process. Falk claimed Sadler served as a privately paid guardian \r\n  ad litem and was not appointed by the family court. In her complaint, Falk initially \r\n  stated \"[a]ll allegations of misconduct attributed to Sadler occurred while \r\n  she was acting within the scope of her contract of employment as Guardian ad \r\n  Litem for the two (2) minor children . . . .\" However, Falk further alleged \r\n  Sadler exceeded the scope of her guardian ad litem duties by advocating Murasawa's \r\n  interests during the separation proceedings and by attempting to negotiate spousal \r\n  support for Falk. Falk also alleged Sadler provided legal advice to Murasawa \r\n  with regard to the Arkansas action to nullify Falk's adoption of Cara. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSadler moved for a judgment on the \r\n  pleadings under Rule 12(c), SCRCP, asserting, among other things, she was entitled \r\n  to immunity for her alleged acts. The trial court granted Sadler's motion, ruling \r\n  Sadler was entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity on all causes of action \r\n  under Fleming v. Asbill, 326 S.C. 49, 483 S.E.2d 751 (1997). The court \r\n  then dismissed the action with prejudice. This appeal follows.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES ON \r\n  APPEAL \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in granting \r\n    blanket immunity to the guardian ad litem and dismissing the action against \r\n    her? \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err by extending \r\n    immunity to a privately paid, non-court-appointed guardian ad litem?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n3. Did the trial court err in applying \r\n  the defense of immunity as described in the Fleming opinion retrospectively? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nAny party may move for a judgment \r\n  on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), SCRCP. When considering such motion, the \r\n  court must regard all properly pleaded factual allegations as admitted. Russell \r\n  v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 406 S.E.2d 338 (1991). On review of the \r\n  motion, the court may not consider matters outside the pleadings. Firemen's \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 302 S.C. 234, 394 S.E.2d 855 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990). \r\n   \r\nA judgment on the pleadings against \r\n  the plaintiff is not proper if there is an issue of fact raised by the complaint \r\n  which, if resolved in favor of the plaintiff, would entitle him to judgment. \r\n  . . . When a fact is well pleaded, any inference of law or conclusions of fact \r\n  that may properly arise therefrom are to be regarded as embraced in the averment. \r\n  Moreover, a complaint is sufficient if it states any cause of action or it appears \r\n  that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief whatsoever. Our courts have held \r\n  that pleadings in a case should be construed liberally so that substantial justice \r\n  is done between the parties.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRussell, 305 S.C. \r\n  at 89, 406 S.E.2d at 339 (citations omitted). Furthermore, \"a judgment on the \r\n  pleadings is considered to be a drastic procedure by our courts.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFalk argues the trial court should \r\n  not have granted Sadler blanket immunity under Fleming on the basis of \r\n  her mere status as a guardian ad litem. Falk contends some of Sadler's alleged \r\n  actions exceeded the scope of her duties as guardian ad litem and thus are not \r\n  protected by immunity under Fleming.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Fleming, our supreme court \r\n  held individuals appointed as guardians ad litem in private custody proceedings \r\n  are entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity for acts performed within the \r\n  scope of their appointment. Fleming, 326 S.C. at 57, 483 S.E.2d at 755-56. \r\n  The court noted the role of a guardian ad litem is to serve as a representative \r\n  of the court and to assist it in protecting the best interests of the child. \r\n  Id. at 54-55, 483 S.E.2d at 754. The court recognized that immunity for \r\n  acts performed within the scope of a guardian ad litem's appointment is necessary \r\n  to protect the guardian from the threat of lawsuits by disgruntled parents. \r\n  Id. at 57, 483 S.E.2d at 755.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Fleming court noted that, \r\n  under a grant of absolute quasi-judicial immunity, a guardian ad litem in a \r\n  private custody dispute could not be found liable for acts of gross negligence \r\n  or even recklessness in the performance of her duties. Id. at 56, 483 \r\n  S.E.2d at 755. However, the court explained certain safeguards exist along with \r\n  the grant of immunity: \r\n   \r\nFirst, the immunity would not \r\n  protect guardians ad litem for actions beyond the scope of their duties. \r\n  Thus, for example, if a guardian abuses a child, she would be liable because \r\n  her actions would fall outside her duties as guardian. Second, the accountability \r\n  of the guardian ad litem is preserved in various ways. For example, the opposing \r\n  party may cross-examine the guardian ad litem and any witnesses whose testimony \r\n  form the basis of the guardian's recommendation. This accountability is further \r\n  ensured through: 1) the appointing court's oversight of the guardian ad litem's \r\n  discharge of duties; 2) the parents' ability to move the court for termination \r\n  of the guardian; 3) the court's prerogative to reject the recommendations of \r\n  the guardian; and 4) judicial review of family court decisions relying on a \r\n  guardian's recommendations.\r\n \r\nId. at 56-57, 483 S.E.2d at \r\n  755 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThus, the immunity available to guardians \r\n  ad litem under Fleming is not a blanket immunity for any and all actions \r\n  taken by the guardian. Rather, the guardian remains liable for actions beyond \r\n  the scope of her duties. It is the nature of the acts, not simply the status \r\n  of the defendant as a guardian ad litem, that determines the availability of \r\n  immunity for the challenged acts and the extent of protection afforded by that \r\n  immunity. See Collins v. Tabet, 806 P.2d 40, 52 (N.M. 1991) (\"[A] \r\n  limited factual inquiry is necessary to determine the nature of [the guardian's] \r\n  appointment and the extent to which he functioned within the scope of that appointment.\") \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, it may well be that \r\n  Falk is simply unhappy with Sadler's recommendation that the court allow Murasawa \r\n  to obtain temporary custody of Cara and return with her to Tokyo. A recommendation \r\n  by the guardian ad litem, no matter how disagreeable to one of the parties, \r\n  will not sustain an action against the guardian of this sort. See Myers \r\n  v. Morris, 810 F.2d 1437, 1466 (8th Cir. 1987) (guardians ad \r\n  litem are absolutely immune from liability in actions based on their function \r\n  of testifying before or making recommendations to the family court), cited \r\n  with approval in Fleming, 326 S.C. at 55-56 n.2, 483 S.E.2d at 755 \r\n  n.2. \r\n   \r\nHowever, Falk alleges in her complaint \r\n  that Sadler exceeded the scope of her guardian ad litem duties in several ways. \r\n  In particular, Falk alleges that Sadler: (1) \"exceed[ed] the scope of her Guardian \r\n  ad Litem duties and responsibilities by advocating, representing or attempting \r\n  to represent the interests of Falk and Murasawa in issues involving the legal \r\n  separation of Falk and Murasawa;\" (2) \"exceed[ed] the scope of her duties and \r\n  responsibilities by interfering with issues between Falk and Murasawa regarding \r\n  spousal support;\" (3) committed misconduct \"[i]n attempting to negotiate spousal \r\n  support for Falk without authorization in exchange for physical separation of \r\n  her minor clients from one another;\" (4) committed misconduct \"[i]n advocating \r\n  and acting under an inherent conflict of interest in the performance of legal \r\n  representation of the best interest of her clients, the minor children;\" and \r\n  (5) committed misconduct \"[i]n undertaking the dual role of Guardian ad Litem \r\n  and providing legal advice to or representation of Murasawa as to legal matters \r\n  between Falk and Murasawa.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurther, Falk alleges Sadler \"counselled \r\n  with, encouraged, advised, aided and/or abetted the malicious use or abuse of \r\n  legal process\" because she: (1) \"interfered with the service of federal process \r\n  in an action to stay the departure of [Cara] from United States jurisdiction\"; \r\n  (2) \"withheld information as to the whereabouts of Murasawa to hinder service \r\n  and aid in his departure from the United States with her minor client, Cara\"; \r\n  and (3) \"gave or participated in the giving of legal advise [sic] to Murasawa \r\n  on avoiding service of process of the federal court action that was designed \r\n  to preserve jurisdiction over the husband as well as Sadler's client, the minor \r\n  child, Cara.\" \r\n   \r\nDespite these allegations that Sadler \r\n  exceeded the scope of her guardian ad litem duties, Falk's complaint begins \r\n  by stating that \"[a]ll allegations of misconduct attributed to Sadler occurred \r\n  while she was acting within the scope of her contract of employment as Guardian \r\n  ad Litem for the two (2) minor children and such misconduct was neither authorized \r\n  nor ratified by Falk.\" We find this allegation to be an ambiguous statement \r\n  subject to different interpretations. One interpretation of this statement is \r\n  that all acts complained of in the pleadings were within the scope of Sadler's \r\n  duties as guardian ad litem. Under this interpretation, the statement clearly \r\n  conflicts with some of the other allegations which assert Sadler committed wrongful \r\n  acts exceeding the scope of her duties as guardian. However, a second interpretation \r\n  of this statement is that Sadler was under contract to act as a guardian ad \r\n  litem at the time she committed her alleged misconduct. This interpretation \r\n  does not conflict with the remaining allegations in the complaint. Thus, on \r\n  its face, the complaint contains ambiguities and raises issues of fact. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt this point in the proceedings, \r\n  we find the grant of a judgment on the pleadings, before discovery has been \r\n  fully completed, is premature. Falk's complaint contains several allegations \r\n  which, if true, show Sadler acted outside the scope of her duties as guardian \r\n  ad litem and is thus not entitled to immunity under Fleming. See \r\n  Fleming, 326 S.C. at 55, 483 S.E.2d at 754 (\"[A] present-day guardian \r\n  ad litem in a private custody dispute functions as a representative of the court \r\n  appointed to assist it in protecting the best interests of the ward. The guardian \r\n  accomplishes this responsibility by ascertaining the best interests of the ward \r\n  and advocating to the court the ward's best interest.\") (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nWe make no determination on the merits \r\n  of this action and merely remand for further proceedings. This result does not \r\n  preclude a later determination that summary judgment or a directed verdict may \r\n  be appropriate, as it does not establish the law of the case or have the effect \r\n  of striking any applicable defense. Cf. Ballenger v. Bowen, \r\n  313 S.C. 476, 477, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994) (\"The denial of summary judgment \r\n  does not establish the law of the case, and the issues raised in the motion \r\n  may be raised again later in the proceedings by a motion to reconsider the summary \r\n  judgment motion or by a motion for a directed verdict.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFalk also argues absolute quasi-judicial \r\n  immunity should not extend to Sadler for any of her acts because Sadler was \r\n  a privately hired, non-court-appointed guardian ad litem. However, we find the \r\n  lack of a court order specifically appointing Sadler as guardian ad litem in \r\n  this case to be immaterial. Falk and Murasawa asked the family court to appoint \r\n  Sadler as guardian ad litem in their pleadings. The family court specifically \r\n  recognized Sadler as the guardian ad litem and noted her custody recommendation \r\n  in its pendente lite order of custody. The family court also issued an order \r\n  for payment of the guardian ad litem's fees. In its order, the court stated \r\n  \"the Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction to appoint Guardians ad Litems \r\n  [sic] and determine their compensation and to assess responsibility for payment \r\n  of said compensation. South Carolina Code Annotated Section 20-7-420 (37). Wherefore, \r\n  it is ordered, adjudged and decreed: 1. That Defendant [Murasawa] shall pay \r\n  the Guardian ad Litem's bill . . . .\" All of these documents were incorporated \r\n  into Sadler's pleadings in the present action. Under these circumstances, we \r\n  believe the lack of a court order of appointment should not preclude Sadler \r\n  from claiming absolute quasi-judicial immunity for any actions which were taken \r\n  within the scope of her duties as guardian ad litem. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo the extent Falk argues the Fleming \r\n  decision's recognition of immunity is inapplicable to the current action, we \r\n  find this assertion to be without merit. Fleming was published on March \r\n  31, 1997, and concerns services of a guardian ad litem rendered from 1986 to \r\n  1989. The current action was filed on August 25, 1997, and concerns events which \r\n  occurred in 1995.  \r\n   \r\nJudicial decisions which create new \r\n  substantive rights must be given prospective effect only, while decisions which \r\n  create new remedies vindicating existing rights may be given retrospective application. \r\n  Toth v. Square D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 377 S.E.2d 584 (1989). Decisions which \r\n  create liability where none previously existed must be given prospective application. \r\n  Id. at 8, 377 S.E.2d at 585. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAbrogation of immunity has the effect \r\n  of creating liability where none previously existed, and thus its application \r\n  would be prospective.

Her father worked for E. I. Du Pont de Nemours at \r\n  several locations. He spent three years at the Du Pont plant in Camden, South \r\n  Carolina during the 1960's. The trial court granted the respondents' Rule 12(b)(1), \r\n  SCRCP, motions to dismiss based upon the Door Closing Statute.(2) \r\n  Murphy and her husband appeal.(3) We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nJanet Baker Murphy was born in Virginia \r\n  in 1960. She lived with her parents, the Bakers, until 1978 when she entered \r\n  college. After attending college, she returned to Virginia where she has resided \r\n  since 1982. In July of 1995, Murphy was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\r\n  \r\n   \r\nJanet Murphy's father, Dr. Charles \r\n  Baker, is a chemical engineer who was employed by E. I. Du Pont de Nemours from \r\n  1951 until his retirement in 1984. He worked at the Du Pont facility in Waynesboro, \r\n  Virginia from 1951 until 1966. From 1966 until 1969, Dr. Baker was employed \r\n  at the Du Pont plant in Camden, South Carolina. He returned to the Waynesboro \r\n  facility in mid-1969 and remained there until 1974. Dr. Baker spent the years \r\n  from 1974 until the summer of 1978 at a Du Pont facility in the Netherlands. \r\n  He returned to the Waynesboro plant in 1978 where he remained until his retirement \r\n  in 1984.\r\nAccording to Dr. Baker, his work \r\n  over the years at various Du Pont facilities caused him to be exposed to asbestos \r\n  dust and fibers. Dr. Baker testified by deposition that one of his major projects \r\n  at the Camden plant was the development of a larger, higher capacity spinning \r\n  cell for spinning Orlon acrylic fiber. The equipment involved in the spinning \r\n  process was continually reconfigured. Dr. Baker stated he was exposed to insulation \r\n  material while observing the removal and re-installation of the equipment. He \r\n  was also exposed to asbestos in other areas of the Camden plant where various \r\n  equipment changes were taking place. He stated there was always evidence of \r\n  some dust in the area and he specifically recalled times when his clothes were \r\n  dusty. \r\n   \r\nAfter his daughter was diagnosed \r\n  with mesothelioma, Dr. Baker came to believe he had exposed his daughter to \r\n  asbestos through his clothing. He held her as an infant and maintained a close \r\n  relationship with her as she grew. Janet Murphy testified in her deposition \r\n  that as a child she was \"daddy's little girl.\" She would crawl into his lap \r\n  and they would read stories or watch television on a daily basis. When her father \r\n  came home from work, she would go through his coat pockets looking for mints. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nIn their motions to dismiss, the \r\n  respondents asserted the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over \r\n  the Murphys' complaint based upon application of the Door Closing Statute. After \r\n  the receipt of memoranda of law and a hearing, the circuit court granted the \r\n  motions. \r\n   \r\nThe court stated that since the Murphys \r\n  were not residents of South Carolina, jurisdiction rested on where the cause \r\n  of action arose. The court held that a cause of action \"arises, accrues, and \r\n  springs into action only when all of the elements exist and one has a \r\n  right to seek relief (i.e. a cause of action) based on such elements. Mere threat \r\n  of future injury is too speculative to support present adjudication.\" The trial \r\n  court concluded Janet Murphy's cause of action did not arise until she was diagnosed \r\n  with mesothelioma in Virginia in 1995. At that point, the final element (i.e. \r\n  injury) needed for a valid cause of action occurred.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nThis is an appeal from the grant \r\n  of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The question \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court. Woodard \r\n  v. Westvaco Corp., 315 S.C. 329, 433 S.E.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1993), vacated \r\n  on other grounds by, 319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995). The court may \r\n  consider affidavits on a question of law in a jurisdictional motion without \r\n  converting the motion into one for summary judgment. Baird v. Charleston \r\n  County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs a preliminary matter, the respondents \r\n  contend the order of the circuit court is not immediately appealable because \r\n  the Murphys' claims against one defendant still remain. The trial court did \r\n  not grant the Rule 12(b)(1),SCRCP, motion with respect to Covil Corporation \r\n  because it is a South Carolina corporation.\r\n \r\nThe respondents rely upon State \r\n  ex rel. McLeod v. C&amp;L Corp. Inc, 280 S.C. 519, 313 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. \r\n  1984) in support of their argument. In that case, the trial court granted summary \r\n  judgment to two defendants during the course of the proceedings. The Attorney \r\n  General did not take an immediate appeal from the order. However, after the \r\n  entry of a final order, the Attorney General filed a cross appeal raising the \r\n  issue of the summary judgment order. The two defendants argued the cross appeal \r\n  should be dismissed because the summary judgment order was a final order from \r\n  which an appeal had not been timely perfected. The supreme court denied the \r\n  motion to dismiss and transferred the case to this court for disposition. Our \r\n  opinion notes the supreme court's ruling on the motion to dismiss was binding \r\n  on this court. Judge Bell, writing for this court, stated that the Attorney \r\n  General's appeal from the final order was sufficient to bring the intermediate \r\n  order granting summary judgment before the court for review. The opinion states \r\n  that \"[w]hen multiple defendants are joined in the same action, an order dismissing \r\n  some but not all of them is ordinarily not final or appealable.\" Id. \r\n  at 529, 313 S.E.2d at 340.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis particular point regarding dismissal \r\n  of some, but not all, multiple defendants has not been cited subsequently by \r\n  our courts. The McLeod case was cited as a general related authority \r\n  in Plaza Development Services v. Joe Harden Builder, 296 S.C. 115, 370 \r\n  S.E.2d 893 (Ct. App. 1988). In that case, this court held that an order granting \r\n  a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion as to some but not all claims against a single \r\n  defendant was not immediately appealable. However, the Plaza Development \r\n  case was overruled on that point by Link v. School District of Pickens County, \r\n  302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176,nt.2 (1990). In Link, the supreme court noted \r\n  it had previously held in Lebovitz v. Mudd, 289 S.C. 476, 347 S.E.2d \r\n  94 (1986) that an order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion as to one of multiple \r\n  claims is directly appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Section 14-3-330(2) because \r\n  it affects a substantial right and strikes out part of a pleading. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is correct that the grant of the \r\n  Rule 12(b)(1) motion in this case is not a final order as there is a remaining \r\n  defendant. However, the practical effect of the grant of the motion is that \r\n  it strikes out the Murphys' complaint with respect to the respondents. Viewing \r\n  McLeod in light of Lebovitz and Link, we conclude an order \r\n  granting a Rule 12 motion as to some, but not all of the defendants in a case, \r\n  is directly appealable under Section 14-3-330(2) because it affects a substantial \r\n  right and strikes out part of a pleading.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Murphys argue the trial court \r\n  erred in its application of the Door Closing Statute. They assert that, with \r\n  respect to an asbestos disease case, the cause of action arises in the state \r\n  of exposure as opposed to the state of diagnosis. The Murphys argue the statute's \r\n  requirement that the \"cause of action shall have arisen . . .within this state\" \r\n  requires a geographical connection to South Carolina. Since some of Janet Murphy's \r\n  exposure occurred in this state from 1966 through 1969, the appellants contend \r\n  they meet the jurisdictional requirements of the Door Closing Statute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn support of their geographical \r\n  nexus argument, the Murphys rely heavily upon three Door Closing Statute cases. \r\n  In Bumgardner v. Keene Corp, 593 F.2d 572 (4th Cir. 1979), \r\n  the federal appeals court held no countervailing federal considerations required \r\n  it to ignore application of the South Carolina Door Closing Statute. Accordingly, \r\n  the circuit court affirmed the district court decision to dismiss the asbestos \r\n  disease case. The case states Bumgardner could have maintained his suit in North \r\n  Carolina, \"the state where he lived, worked and was allegedly exposed to asbestos.\" \r\n  Id. at 573. In Collins v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 901 F. Supp. \r\n  1038 (D.S.C. 1995), the federal district court held the Door Closing Statute \r\n  jurisdictionally barred a wrongful death suit by a Georgia resident against \r\n  several foreign corporations. The cause of action allegedly arose from Collins's \r\n  development of emphysema as a result of smoking cigarettes manufactured by the \r\n  various corporate defendants. The district court concluded Collins's claims \r\n  arose in Georgia \"[b]ecause any cigarette purchases by Collins in South Carolina \r\n  were incidental to his job as a truck driver and were minimal in nature, and \r\n  because all of the remaining connections to plaintiff's claims are with Georgia. \r\n  . . .\" Id. at 1044. In that regard, the court noted Collins lived in \r\n  Georgia; worked for a Georgia trucking company; and was diagnosed, treated, \r\n  and died in Georgia. Finally, in Rosenthal v. Unarco Industries, Inc., \r\n  278 S.C. 420, 297 S.E.2d 638 (1982), the South Carolina Supreme Court held the \r\n  Door Closing Statute was constitutional as it did not violate equal protection. \r\n  In the opinion, the court noted the Door Closing Statute barred the plaintiff's \r\n  claims as he was a New York State resident and it was undisputed \"the plaintiff \r\n  has sustained no exposure and has not been employed within the state of South \r\n  Carolina.\" Id. at 425, 297 S.E.2d at 642. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe do not believe these three cases \r\n  offer definitive support for the appellants' position. The Bumgardner \r\n  case is a two paragraph opinion which provides no specific analysis of the facts \r\n  as they relate to application of the Door Closing Statute. The Collins \r\n  case notes the facts of geographical nexus with South Carolina, but it also \r\n  makes a conclusion that \"one test for determining where a cause of action arises \r\n  is to ascertain where the delict or wrong has its effect.\" Collins, 901 \r\n  F. Supp. at 1044. Such an argument cuts against the appellants' position since \r\n  undoubtedly the delict in this case has its effect in Virginia. Finally, the \r\n  Rosenthal case is not dispositive because the focus of that opinion was \r\n  the constitutional law question.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Door Closing Statute relates \r\n  to the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Nix v. Mercury \r\n  Motors Express Inc., 270 S.C. 477, 242 S.E.2d 683 (1978). Our supreme court \r\n  has stated the Door Closing Statute accomplishes several legislative objectives \r\n  rationally related to the state's interest. These objectives are (1) favoritism \r\n  to resident plaintiffs over nonresident plaintiffs, (2) provision of a forum \r\n  for wrongs connected with the state while avoiding the resolution of wrongs \r\n  in which the state has little interest, and (3) encouragement of activity and \r\n  investment in the state by foreign corporations without subjecting them to actions \r\n  unrelated to their activity within the state. Rosenthal v. Unarco Industries \r\n  Inc., 278 S.C. 420, 297 S.E.2d 638 (1982). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe crucial language in the statute \r\n  is \"when the cause of action shall have arisen . . . within this [s]tate.\" In \r\n  Ophuls &amp; Hill v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 160 S.C. 441, 158 S.E. \r\n  824 (1931), the supreme court defined the term \"cause of action\" in the context \r\n  of the Door Closing Statute. The court stated \"the cause of action \r\n  has been described as being a legal wrong threatened or committed against the \r\n  complaining party.\" Id. at 450, 158 S.E. at 827. See also Knight \r\n  v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 184 S.C. 362, 192 S.E. 558 (1937). \r\n  With respect to the term \"arise\" in the Door Closing Statute, the supreme court \r\n  in Cornelius v. Atlantic GreyHound Lines, 177 S.C. 93, 180 S.E. 791 (1935), \r\n  equated \"arise\" with \"accrue\" and stated that a \"cause of action accrues when \r\n  facts exist which authorize one party to maintain an action against another.\" \r\n  Id. at 96, 180 S.E. at 792. (quoting 1 C.J. 1146). Beyond the context \r\n  of the Door Closing statute, the supreme court has stated that our cases have \r\n  used the verbs \"arise\" and \"accrue\" interchangeably and a cause of action in \r\n  tort accrues at the moment when the plaintiff has a legal right to sue on it. \r\n  Stephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 488 S.E.2d 307 (1997).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe elements of a cause of action \r\n  in tort are (1) duty, (2) breach of that duty, (3) proximate causation, and \r\n  (4) injury. Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, 269 S.C. 479, 238 S.E.2d \r\n  167 (1977). In the factual context of this case, all of those elements were \r\n  met when Janet Murphy was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Prior to that point, \r\n  the element of injury had not been established. Once injury was established, \r\n  the cause of action or \"legal wrong\" had \"arisen\" and Murphy could maintain \r\n  an action in tort against the respondents. Accordingly, the cause of action \r\n  arose in Virginia, not South Carolina. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decision of the circuit court \r\n  is  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, J., and MOREHEAD, \r\n  A.J., concur. \r\n1.  As relevant \r\n  to this case, S.C.Code Ann. Â§15-5-150 (1977) provides \"[a]n action against a \r\n  corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, government, or \r\n  country may be brought in the circuit court: (2) [b]y a plaintiff not a resident \r\n  of this State when the cause of action shall have arisen . . . within this State.\" \r\n  \r\n2.  Application \r\n  of the Door Closing Statute is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. Nix \r\n  v. Mercury Motor Express Inc., 270 S.C. 477, 242 S.E.2d 683 (1978). \r\n3.

We reverse and remand. \r\n   \r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY   \r\nOn October 29, 1976, Purchaser entered \r\n  into an installment sales contract to buy land in Horry County from Seller. \r\n  The contract contained a default provision which stated: \"In the event the Purchaser \r\n  should fail to make any due installment, and such default shall continue for \r\n  a period of thirty (30) days, the Seller shall have the right to declare this \r\n  contract terminate[d] and all amounts previously paid by the Purchaser will \r\n  be retained by the Seller as rent.\" Thereafter, Purchaser moved a mobile home \r\n  onto the property and established a residence. \r\n   \r\nPurchaser made the required monthly \r\n  payments under the installment contract until July 1988. On October 10, 1989, \r\n  Seller mailed a certified letter to Purchaser advising that the contract would \r\n  be canceled on October 30, 1989 for nonpayment and requesting that Purchaser \r\n  remove his personal property from the land. The letter was returned to Seller \r\n  marked unclaimed. Purchaser asserted he never received this letter although \r\n  he conceded the notice was sent to the correct address. \r\n   \r\nIn 1992, Purchaser contacted Seller \r\n  in an attempt to resume making payments. A representative of Seller agreed to \r\n  take the matter under advisement, but Seller ultimately did not respond to Purchaser's \r\n  inquiry. In 1996, Purchaser tendered a check in an attempt to settle the debt, \r\n  which Seller promptly refused. The check was written in an amount which approximately \r\n  covered the balance due at the time of default, without accumulated interest. \r\n  Purchaser maintained the residence on the subject property throughout this entire \r\n  period, and Seller never attempted to eject Purchaser from the property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPurchaser then brought an action \r\n  requesting specific performance. Seller counterclaimed, alleging Purchaser was \r\n  in default and the contract had been terminated. Seller alternatively sought \r\n  foreclosure of any equitable interest the Purchaser obtained as a result of \r\n  the transaction. After a final hearing, the master concluded the contract was \r\n  terminated after Purchaser's default. The master determined Purchaser held no \r\n  equitable interest in the land which required foreclosure and ordered Purchaser \r\n  to remove any personal property . \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis action was commenced as an equitable \r\n  action for specific performance of the contract for the sale of land. Moreover, \r\n  an action for foreclosure or the cancellation of an instrument is in equity. \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 324 S.C. 570, 479 S.E.2d 510 (Ct.

In an action in equity referred to a master-in-equity \r\n  or a special referee for final judgment, this court may take its own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence although it is not required to disregard the \r\n  findings of the master. See Friarsgate, Inc. v. First Federal Sav. \r\n  &amp; Loan Assoc. of S.C., 317 S.C. 452, 454 S.E.2d 901 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nPurchaser maintains that he holds \r\n  an equitable interest in the property which is not subject to strict forfeiture. \r\n  Purchaser further argues that he was entitled to tender the balance due with \r\n  interest and enforce the contract prior to a judicial determination.  \r\n   \r\nIn Dempsey v. Huskey, 224 \r\n  S.C. 536, 80 S.E.2d 119 (1954), our supreme court recognized the general principle \r\n  that an equitable interest arises in a vendee under a contract for the sale \r\n  of land, although legal title to the property is retained by the vendor. In \r\n  Dempsey, the court stated:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt would appear beyond dispute in \r\n  this State in a case of an agreement to buy and sell real estate, where the \r\n  vendee defaults the vendor has a right to foreclose as in the case of a mortgage. \r\n  The equitable title is in the vendee. The legal title is in the vendor. When \r\n  such an action is brought to adjudicate the rights of the vendor and vendee[,] \r\n  the vendor corresponds to the mortgagee and the vendee corresponds to the mortgagor. \r\n  The court may sell the property and pay to the vendor the remaining amount of \r\n  the purchase price, together with costs of the action, and interest in a proper \r\n  case. \r\n   \r\nId. at 541-42, 80 S.E.2d at \r\n  121. \r\n   \r\nThe Supreme Court again addressed \r\n  the accrual of an equitable interest in Davis v. Monteith, 289 S.C. 176, \r\n  345 S.E.2d 724 (1986). In that case, Davis contracted to purchase three acres \r\n  of land from the Monteith School District for three thousand dollars in 1949. \r\n  Davis paid $100.00 earnest money when the contract was signed. Under the contract's \r\n  terms, the balance of $2900.00 was due within thirty days. However, Davis never \r\n  made any additional payment for the land. Nonetheless, Davis used the property \r\n  for thirty or more years without paying rent or taxes. The School District retained \r\n  the deed to the land.  \r\n   \r\nIn 1976, Davis attempted to pay the \r\n  $2900.00 balance but the School district returned the check. The trial court \r\n  found Davis had an equitable interest in the property. However, Davis appealed \r\n  this finding arguing he had a legal interest in the property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Supreme Court found Davis's free \r\n  use of the property for thirty or more years did not give rise to an equitable \r\n  interest. The facts of Davis are distinguishable from those of the case \r\n  at bar for the following reasons: 1)Davis did not enter into a long-term installment \r\n  sales contract for the land; and 2) Davis did not pay a substantial portion \r\n  of the price of the land over a number of years. \r\nIn Southern Pole Bldgs, Inc. v. \r\n  Williams, 289 S.C. 521, 347 S.E.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1986), this court held \r\n  that purchasers of property under an installment contract acquire an equitable \r\n  interest. In Southern Pole, the seller under an installment contract \r\n  attempted to avoid foreclosure of several mechanic's liens that the purchaser \r\n  allowed to be filed against the subject property. The seller argued that the \r\n  purchaser ceased making payments under the contract, thereby forfeiting all \r\n  ownership rights under the contract's default provisions and negating the contract. \r\n  This court recognized that the purchaser held an equitable interest in the property \r\n  under the contract and that the mechanic's liens attached prior to any default. \r\n  However, this court did not specifically address what measures are necessary \r\n  to divest a purchaser of an equitable interest.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough we find no reported South \r\n  Carolina case with identical facts to those of the instant case, our sister \r\n  state, North Carolina, addressed similar facts and issues recently in Lamberth \r\n  v. McDaniel, 506 S.E.2d 295 (N.C. App. 1998). In Lamberth, the vendors \r\n  of land under an installment sales contract brought an action asserting the \r\n  vendees' failure to make payments was a forfeiture under the sales contract. \r\n  The contract contained a default provision similar to that applicable in the \r\n  instant case. \r\n   \r\nThe Lamberth Court recognized \r\n  an equitable interest in a vendee under an executory agreement for the sale \r\n  of land, stating:  \r\n   \r\nIt has been held repeatedly that \r\n  \"the relation between vendor and vendee in an executory agreement for the sale \r\n  and purchase of land is substantially that subsisting between mortgagee and \r\n  mortgagor, and governed by the same general rules.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLamberth, 506 S.E.2d at 296. \r\n  In expanding on this view, the court found in the event of default, a vendor-mortgagee \r\n  may choose a variety of remedies, including forfeiture if the contract allows, \r\n  while a vendee-mortgagor has the right to redeem his interest under the contract \r\n  to prevent forfeiture. See also Boyd v. Watts, 342 S.E.2d 840 \r\n  (N.C.1986) (recognizing among a vendor's options in the case of a default the \r\n  right to initiate a quiet title action, accept noncompliance as a forfeiture, \r\n  or initiate an action to declare the contract at an end). The court further \r\n  held a vendee's right to redeem cannot be waived by contract at the time of \r\n  the agreement. We find this reasoning persuasive and applicable to the instant \r\n  case.(2)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe master determined the contract \r\n  was properly canceled under the assumption that Purchaser never possessed an \r\n  equitable interest. We hold Purchaser possessed an equitable interest in the \r\n  property as well as an ancillary redemption right which could have prevented \r\n  forfeiture or foreclosure. We further hold that Purchaser has not been afforded \r\n  the opportunity to exercise his right of redemption in the instant case. Seller \r\n  mailed a notice of default which was admittedly returned marked unclaimed. Seller \r\n  took no further actions to assert any forfeiture right. The only contact between \r\n  Seller and Purchaser after 1988 resulted from Purchaser's attempt in 1992 to \r\n  resume payments and subsequent attempt to pay the balance in 1996. Seller correctly \r\n  asserts that it was not required to accept an insufficient amount as payment. \r\n  However, since the time Seller asserted his rights by way of counterclaim, Purchaser \r\n  has asserted that he stands ready and willing to pay the balance due with accumulated \r\n  interest thereon.(3)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the lower \r\n  court's order and remand for the master to enforce Seller's right to seek forfeiture \r\n  or foreclosure subject to Purchaser's right of redemption. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe judgment of the lower court is \r\n  hereby \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, CONNOR and HOWARD, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1. Our courts \r\n  have expressed a general willingness to avoid forfeitures upon the slightest \r\n  of evidence. However, forfeiture has been recognized as a remedy available to \r\n  a vendor under a contract . See Elliott v. Snyder, 246 S.C. 186, \r\n  143 S.E.2d 374 (1965). In Elliott, the seller under an installment land \r\n  sale contract brought an action for rescission and cancellation thereof. The \r\n  buyer tendered an installment check which was returned marked \"Drawn against \r\n  uncollected funds.\" The court held the seller was on notice that the check was \r\n  not worthless but that the funds drawn upon had not been collected at that time. \r\n  The court found there was substantial compliance with the terms of the contract \r\n  sufficient to prevent a forfeiture, and that seller was not entitled to rescind. \r\n  See also First Trust &amp; Sav. Bank of Rock Hill v. Pruitt, 121 \r\n  S.C. 484, 113 S.E. 469 (1922). In First Trust, the purchaser under an \r\n  installment contract sought to avoid specific performance by arguing that default \r\n  in payment resulted in forfeiture of any rights, leaving the seller with any \r\n  sums previously paid as liquidated damages. The court denied purchaser's argument, \r\n  recognizing that there can be no forfeiture without some affirmative action \r\n  on the part of the person who is to take by forfeiture. The court further recognized \r\n  that such clauses \"are intended to insure a prompt and faithful performance \r\n  by the purchaser, and may be enforced or not, at the election of the vendor.\" \r\n  Id. at 491, 113 S.E. at 471. (citations omitted) The court noted that \r\n  in some cases \"the vendor may elect to insist on forfeiture or enforce specific \r\n  performance under such provisions for forfeiture and liquidated damages, even \r\n  though the contract contain [sic] the further provision that default on the \r\n  part of the vendee is to render the contract null and void.\" Id. (citations \r\n  omitted). \r\n2.  \r\nThis view accords with Elliott v. \r\nSnyder, 246 S.C. 186, 143 S.E.2d 374 (1965) in which the court wrote: \"Forfeitures \r\nare not favored in law and Courts will seize upon even slight evidence to prevent \r\none[.]\" Id. at 191, 143 S.E.2d at 375 (citations omitted). \r\n3. The parties \r\n  disputed the proper interest calculation under the contract. This issue was \r\n  not before the court on appeal. The master is allowed to take additional evidence \r\n  and make additional findings as necessary upon remand to determine the amount \r\n  owed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3205","title":"State v.

They argue the trial court erred in \r\n  excluding certain impeachment evidence against the State's primary witness. \r\n  We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn September 24, 1996, Howard Woods \r\n  arrived home to find his backdoor open. Woods concluded from the broken lock \r\n  and dark scuff mark on the door that someone had opened the door by kicking \r\n  it. Inside he discovered more than thirty of the firearms he collected were \r\n  missing. Officers investigating the crime discovered Thomas Harley had nine \r\n  of the stolen guns. These nine guns were conservatively valued at more than \r\n  $2,000. Harley initially did not want to cooperate with authorities but eventually \r\n  returned the guns to law enforcement. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased on the police investigation, \r\n  the Colleton County Grand Jury indicted the Mizzells on one count each of grand \r\n  larceny, first degree burglary, and possession of a weapon during the commission \r\n  of a crime. The State thereafter tried the Mizzells on one count each of grand \r\n  larceny, second degree burglary, and possession of a weapon during the commission \r\n  of a crime. \r\n   \r\nAt trial, Harley testified that he \r\n  purchased the guns for $700 from the Mizzells. The Mizzells arrived at his home \r\n  in a truck and offered to sell him some guns. He picked seven guns from a selection \r\n  of guns inside the truck. The Mizzells then \"threw in two for free.\" He recalled \r\n  seeing another man and a woman in the truck. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter police investigation revealed \r\n  Donald Steele was the man Harley saw in the truck, the State charged Steele \r\n  with the same crimes as the Mizzells but planned to try Steele for those crimes \r\n  after the Mizzells' trial. Steele testified at the Mizzells' trial. Although \r\n  Steele admitted participating in the burglary and larceny, he portrayed himself \r\n  in the best possible light. He testified that he drove himself, his estranged \r\n  wife, and the Mizzells to Woods's home in his truck. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccording to Steele, after Tootie \r\n  kicked the door open, the Mizzells went inside the home. When the Mizzells returned, \r\n  they were carrying guns which they threw into the back of the truck. After the \r\n  Mizzells got back into the truck, Steele drove away from the scene. The Mizzells \r\n  instructed him to drive down a particular road to a house where the Mizzells \r\n  sold some of the guns. Steele again drove down some more roads as instructed. \r\n  Steele testified that when they neared the outskirts of Summerville, he stopped \r\n  and told the Mizzells to take the guns out of his truck. The Mizzells hid the \r\n  guns in a ditch on the side of the road. The Mizzells and Steele then purchased \r\n  marijuana and crack cocaine, drove to a motel, and smoked the drugs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring Steele's cross-examination, \r\n  Jamie Mizzell's counsel attempted to ask Steele how much prison time he could \r\n  receive for the crimes with which he was charged. After suggesting the State \r\n  should object, the trial court held a hearing on the matter. The trial court \r\n  ruled the precise potential sentences Steele faced were inadmissible, reasoning \r\n  the Mizzells were attempting to improperly bring their own potential penal liability \r\n  before the jury through \"the back door.\" The State suggested the Mizzells could \r\n  ask Steele whether he could go to jail for a long time if convicted. Jamie Mizzell's \r\n  counsel agreed to conform the question as requested. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring the same hearing, the trial \r\n  court also considered the Mizzells' request to admit evidence of Steele's seventeen-year-old \r\n  convictions for housebreaking and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. \r\n  The Mizzells allegedly wanted to introduce this evidence in order to \"let the \r\n  jury know about the credibility and the believability of [Steele].\" Additionally, \r\n  in a prior discussion, the Mizzells suggested this evidence would show Steele \r\n  engaged in a pattern of using or influencing people younger than himself to \r\n  engage in criminal activity. The trial court ruled the evidence inadmissible, \r\n  dismissing any potential probative value. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, \r\n  the trial court directed verdicts in favor of the Mizzells on the charges of \r\n  possession of weapons during the commission of a crime. The trial court then \r\n  submitted the remaining charges to the jury, and the jury returned guilty verdicts \r\n  on all charges. The trial court sentenced Jamie Mizzell to fifteen years for \r\n  second degree burglary and five concurrent years for grand larceny. The trial \r\n  court sentenced Tootie Mizzell to fifteen years for second degree burglary, \r\n  suspended upon service of five years and five years probation, and five concurrent \r\n  years for grand larceny. In addition, the trial court ordered each of the Mizzells \r\n  to pay restitution in the sum of $8,010, with joint and several liability. This \r\n  appeal follows. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Rule 609, \r\n  SCRE \r\n   \r\nThe Mizzells argue the trial court \r\n  erred in refusing to permit evidence of Steele's 1981 convictions for housebreaking \r\n  and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. They first argue the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to exercise its discretion under Rule 609, SCRE. They also \r\n  maintain that if the trial court had exercised its discretion, the evidence \r\n  would have been admissible. We find no reversible error. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRulings on the admissibility of evidence \r\n  are within the trial court's discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion. Baber v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. \r\n  31, 488 S.E.2d 314 (1997). Further, \"[t]he scope of cross-examination is within \r\n  the discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal \r\n  absent a showing of prejudice.\" State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 625, 525 \r\n  S.E.2d 246, 247-48 (2000), aff'g as modified, 332 S.C. 313, 504 S.E.2d \r\n  360 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n   \r\nRule 609 (b), SCRE, governs the use \r\n  of stale convictions to impeach witnesses. This subsection provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEvidence of a conviction under this \r\n  rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since \r\n  the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement \r\n  imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court \r\n  determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction \r\n  supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial \r\n  effect. \r\n   \r\nRule 609(b), SCRE (emphasis added). \r\n  According to this rule, a conviction more than ten years old is presumptively \r\n  inadmissible. Colf, 337 S.C. at 626, 525 S.E.2d at 248. The trial court \r\n  may allow the conviction into evidence only after deciding the probative value \r\n  of the evidence substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect and \"articulating \r\n  for the record the specific facts and circumstances supporting its decision.\" \r\n  Id. at 629, 525 S.E.2d at 249. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased on our reading of the rule, \r\n  the trial court must make specific findings on the record only when admitting \r\n  evidence of remote convictions. See United States v. Cavender, \r\n  578 F.2d 528, 532 (4th Cir. 1978) (\"We conclude that 609(b) requires \r\n  the District Court, if it concludes to admit thereunder a conviction more than \r\n  ten years old, to find that the probative value of such conviction 'substantially \r\n  outweighs' its prejudicial impact and to support that finding with an identification \r\n  of the 'specific facts and circumstances' which support its decision.\"); Colf, \r\n  337 S.C. at 626, 525 S.E.2d at 248 (appellate court held that since Rule 609(b), \r\n  SCRE, is identical to Rule 609(b), FRE, federal cases may be persuasive). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the trial court refused \r\n  to admit Steele's remote convictions into evidence. The trial court, therefore, \r\n  was not required to articulate on the record its weighing of the probative value \r\n  and prejudicial effect. The record, however, does reflect the following discussion \r\n  concerning the trial court's decision: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS [counsel for Tootie Mizzell]: \r\n  Your Honor, this gentleman, Mr. Steele, has a prior record for house breaking. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHas a prior record for contributing \r\n  to the delinquency of a minor. I believe that those are crimes that we should \r\n  be able to enter in and cross examine him on. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: That was 1981. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS: Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: What does it have to do \r\n  with this case? He said he did it [participated in the burglary and larceny \r\n  involving Woods's home]. What does it have to do with this case? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS: I think it has a lot - \r\n  - same crime. It's the same situation, Your Honor. I mean, he's charged with \r\n  the same crime. \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: That's what the statute \r\n  is all about. \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS: Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: You can't impeach somebody. \r\n  Rather you can't ask them about a crime of moral turpitude except by the statute. \r\n  Now you say that I have the discretion to do it, to allow it, but what would \r\n  it add or subtract from this case if he says, I did it? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS: Well, I think - - \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: What's the purpose of \r\n  using it? \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS: To let the jury know about \r\n  the credibility and the believability of this gentleman right here. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: All right. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMR. BONDS: That's exactly what - \r\n  - \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMR. BRYAN [counsel for Jamie Mizzell]: \r\n  Your Honor, I join in Mr. Bonds [sic] motion. I would also point out that this \r\n  witness here is evading responsibility on his own part. He's admitting being \r\n  there and being in the truck, not knowing what the crime was about. He didn't \r\n  - - \r\n   \r\nTHE COURT: He already said his attorney \r\n  told him it was serious. And I assume the good lawyer that his lawyer is he \r\n  told him to [sic] hand of one is the hand of the other whether he's inside or \r\n  outside. So I'm not going to let that in. Anything further? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is apparent from this discussion \r\n  that, while the trial court did not expressly compare the probative value and \r\n  prejudicial effect of the evidence before ruling it was inadmissible, the trial \r\n  court did analyze these factors. Based on the trial court's analysis, it excluded \r\n  the presumptively inadmissible evidence. We, therefore, find no abuse of the \r\n  trial court's discretion. \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, we agree with the trial \r\n  court that the probative value of the evidence did not warrant its admission. \r\n  The Mizzells argue on appeal that the admission of this evidence was necessary \r\n  to support their theory of the defense that: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nthey acted under the domination and \r\n  influence of Donald Steele. Likewise, the fact that Mr. Steele had previously \r\n  been convicted of a crime in which his co-defendants were substantially younger \r\n  than he would have greatly bolstered the defense theory of the case. Without \r\n  this evidence before the jury, the defense had absolutely nothing by way of \r\n  proof to support its version of events.  \r\n   \r\nIntroduction of Steele's prior convictions \r\n  potentially would have cast doubt upon his claim that he was unaware of the \r\n  Mizzells' plan to break into Woods's home before arriving on the scene. This \r\n  evidence, however, would not have diminished the State's assertion that the \r\n  Mizzells participated as principals in the burglary. The evidence likely would \r\n  have enhanced, rather than reduced, the possibility that the jury would have \r\n  believed the Mizzells entered the home and took the guns. We conclude the trial \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence under Rule 609(b), \r\n  SCRE. \r\n   \r\nII. Confrontation \r\n  Clause \r\n   \r\nThe Mizzells next argue the trial \r\n  court violated their Confrontation Clause rights by preventing their cross-examination \r\n  of Steele on his remote convictions and pending penal liability. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe general rule that a trial court's \r\n  ruling on the scope of cross-examination will not be disturbed absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion is subject to the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a defendant's \r\n  right to meaningful cross-examination. State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 642 (1998). \r\n   \r\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees \r\n  an accused the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. \r\n  Const. amend. VI. The right to cross-examine adverse witnesses is the primary \r\n  purpose of the defendant's right to confrontation. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, \r\n  475 U.S. 673 (1986). Trial courts, however, \"retain wide latitude insofar as \r\n  the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination \r\n  based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion \r\n  of the issues, the witness's safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or \r\n  only marginally relevant.\" Id. at 679. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[A] criminal defendant states a violation \r\n  of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging \r\n  in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form \r\n  of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \"to expose to the jury the facts \r\n  from which the jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to \r\n  the reliability of the witness.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 680 (quoting Davis \r\n  v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308 (1974)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Remote \r\n  Convictions \r\n   \r\nWe are not convinced by the Mizzells' \r\n  argument that their Confrontation Clause rights were violated when they were \r\n  prevented from questioning Steele concerning his 1981 convictions. As previously \r\n  discussed, the trial court properly refused to permit the cross-examination \r\n  under Rule 609, SCRE. Thus, the Mizzells were not prohibited from engaging in \r\n  otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to impeach Steele. Furthermore, \r\n  this evidence was irrelevant to the question of their guilt. The trial court, \r\n  therefore, properly exercised its discretion in preventing this cross-examination. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Pending \r\n  Penal Liability \r\n   \r\nWe are also unpersuaded by the Mizzells' \r\n  argument that their Confrontation Clause rights were violated when the trial \r\n  court prevented them from asking Steele about his potential penal liability. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the time of trial, Steele was \r\n  under indictment for the same offenses as the Mizzells. The trial court refused \r\n  to allow the Mizzells to cross-examine Steele regarding the potential sentences \r\n  he could receive if convicted. Because the Mizzells were being tried for the \r\n  same crimes as Steele, the trial court ruled the sentences he faced if convicted \r\n  were irrelevant and inadmissible. The trial court perceived this line of questioning \r\n  as an attempt to tell the jury the sentences the Mizzells could receive if convicted \r\n  but permitted the Mizzells to ask Steele whether he faced a lengthy prison term. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find the Mizzells' right to confront \r\n  Steele on his potential bias or motive for testifying was protected. Steele \r\n  admitted he faced a long sentence for his participation in the burglary and \r\n  larceny. Furthermore, the Mizzells questioned Steele about his reason for providing \r\n  a self-incriminating written statement and whether he hoped to receive a \"deal\" \r\n  for his testimony. We find no constitutional violation here. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the reasons discussed above the \r\n  Mizzells' appealed convictions are \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3206","title":"State v.

Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________\r\n  \r\nHEARN, C.J.: Paul \r\n  Coleman appeals his conviction for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), \r\n  alleging the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury on the lesser \r\n  included offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN). \r\n  We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn January 10, 1997, at or about \r\n  11:23 p.m., Victim and his co-employee were working at a Subway restaurant preparing \r\n  to close for the evening. Victim had stepped in the back to take out the trash \r\n  when he heard the front doorbell ring. Victim testified he returned to the front \r\n  of the store but found no one there.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe assailant, Paul Coleman, wearing \r\n  a black ski mask and a jacket with the hood pulled over his head, jumped out \r\n  at Victim, pointed a gun at him, and said, \"Give me all your money. Give me \r\n  all your f------ money, mother f-----.\" Victim attempted to open the cash register \r\n  but before he had the opportunity, the assailant shot him in the eye and fled. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPolice arrived shortly thereafter \r\n  and retrieved a videotape of the incident recorded by a surveillance camera. \r\n  The video, which operated with a four-second time lapse, first depicted Victim \r\n  walking from the back of the store. The camera then revealed Coleman pointing \r\n  a gun at Victim. The following picture showed Victim stepping towards the cash \r\n  register in an attempt to comply with Coleman's orders, while Coleman raised \r\n  the gun to aim at Victim's head. The camera next disclosed smoke from the gunfire; \r\n  however, Victim, who had fallen to the floor, was not visible in this scene. \r\n  The last image showed Victim's co-employee fleeing to the back of the store. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, the State presented Erick \r\n  Rodgers, who testified he was the \"look out\" person for Coleman in the attempted \r\n  robbery. Rodgers testified Coleman picked him up on the day of the robbery because \r\n  Coleman wanted to \"rob somebody.\" Rodgers stated he saw Coleman enter the Subway \r\n  that night and then heard a gunshot in the restaurant. Coleman exited the restaurant \r\n  and they both fled in a pickup truck. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe State also called Travon McCoy \r\n  who testified Coleman told him he was the assailant in the attempted robbery. \r\n  McCoy stated:  \r\n   \r\nAnd when he [Coleman] told me about \r\n  it, he said that he went in the store and the man, he kept demanding money from \r\n  the man. Apparently the man didn't believe him. So he said he just panicked \r\n  and shot him, you know. . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\nColeman's statement, which he gave \r\n  the police shortly before his arrest and after he learned Rodgers and McCoy \r\n  had implicated him, was also introduced at trial. Coleman stated: \"I went in. \r\n  I went by a little hallway part. I had a gun when I went in. I came back out \r\n  from the hallway. All I know, I got scared and started to run and heard a shot. \r\n  . . .\" \r\n   \r\nAt the close of the evidence, Coleman \r\n  requested the judge charge the jury on the lesser included offense of ABHAN. \r\n  The judge denied this request. The jury convicted Coleman on both counts and \r\n  the judge sentenced him to twenty years for ABIK and ten years for attempted \r\n  armed robbery. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is well settled that a jury instruction \r\n  on a lesser included offense is required only when the evidence warrants such \r\n  an instruction. Hopper v. Evans, 456 U.S. 605, 611 (1982). It is not \r\n  error to refuse to charge the lesser included offense unless there is evidence \r\n  tending to show the defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense. \r\n  State v. Atkins, 293 S.C. 294, 299, 360 S.E.2d 302, 305 (1987) (emphasis \r\n  added), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 \r\n  S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). We do not believe that evidence is present here. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nABIK is an unlawful act of a violent \r\n  nature to the person of another with malice aforethought, either express or \r\n  implied. State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 14, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1996); State \r\n  v. Hinson, 253 S.C. 607, 611, 172 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1970). ABIK also requires \r\n  the intent to kill. Foust, 325 S.C. at 15, 479 S.E.2d at 51. However, \r\n  this intent need only be a general intent, demonstrated by acts and conduct \r\n  from which a jury may naturally and reasonably infer intent. Foust, 325 \r\n  S.C. at 15, 479 S.E.2d at 51. Intent may be proved with evidence of the character \r\n  of the means or instrument used. Foust at 16, n.4, 479 S.E.2d at 52, \r\n  n.4; 41 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 195 (1991); see also 41 C.J.S. Homicide \r\n  Â§ 179 (1991) (intent to kill may be inferred from \"the character of the assault, \r\n  the use of a deadly weapon with an opportunity to deliberate, or the use of \r\n  a dangerous or deadly weapon in a manner reasonably calculated to cause death \r\n  or great bodily harm\"). Likewise, the manner in which the instrument was used, \r\n  the purpose to be accomplished, and the resulting injuries may also prove intent. \r\n  See 41 C.J.S. Homicide Â§195 (1991). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nABHAN, on the other hand, requires \r\n  an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation. \r\n  State v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 286 n.2, 478 S.E.2d 871, 877 n.2 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996). Such aggravating circumstances include the use of a deadly weapon, \r\n  the infliction of serious bodily injury, the intent to commit a felony, great \r\n  disparity between the ages and physical conditions of the parties involved, \r\n  and the difference in the sexes. State v. Murphy, 322 S.C. 321, 324-25, \r\n  471 S.E.2d 739, 740-41 (Ct. App. 1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nColeman argues he should have been \r\n  given the charge of the lesser included offense of ABHAN. We disagree.\r\nAn ABHAN charge is appropriate when \r\n  the evidence demonstrates the defendant lacked the requisite intent to kill. \r\n  State v. Hilton, 284 S.C. 245, 249, 325 S.E.2d 575, 577 (Ct. App. 1985). \r\n  However, State v. Foust, holds that only a general intent to kill is \r\n  necessary to support an ABIK charge. Foust, 325 S.C. at 15, 479 S.E.2d \r\n  at 51. We find the facts of this case analogous to those in Foust. In \r\n  Foust, the appellant was convicted of first degree burglary, ABIK, and \r\n  possession of a knife during the commission of a violent crime. The victim was \r\n  stabbed in the chest by Foust when she returned home from work and discovered \r\n  him burglarizing her home. At trial, the State introduced a letter written by \r\n  Foust in which he claimed he never intended to hurt the victim. Foust, \r\n  325 S.C. at 13, 479 S.E.2d at 50. The supreme court found that despite Foust's \r\n  denial of an intent to kill the victim, a general intent to kill was sufficient \r\n  to support an ABIK charge. His use of a deadly weapon while burglarizing victim's \r\n  home, and the fact that the victim sustained serious injuries, were held to \r\n  be adequate evidence of such general intent. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the present case, the trial judge \r\n  stated he could not charge the jury on ABHAN because Coleman shot Victim in \r\n  the head: \r\n   \r\n \"I just can't see, . . . somebody \r\n  standing there with both hands on a pistol, directly in front of somebody pulling \r\n  the trigger and shooting him in the head, how that could possibl[y] be assault \r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature. I mean, it's either assault and \r\n  battery with intent to kill, or nothing, to me.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe agree with the trial judge's reasoning. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nColeman's manner in using the weapon \r\n  - pointing the gun at Victim and then deliberately raising the gun to aim at \r\n  Victim's head just before he fired(2) - could \r\n  have only been reasonably calculated to kill or cause great bodily harm to Victim. \r\n  Moreover, the resulting wound was near-fatal. The bullet narrowly missed Victim's \r\n  brain, grazing the skull just above Victim's left eye and leaving him almost \r\n  blind in that eye. \r\n   \r\nColeman offers no excuse or justification \r\n  for his act, except that he \"panicked.\" This assertion alone cannot mitigate \r\n  his general intent to kill, as evidenced by his voluntary act of shooting Victim \r\n  in the head. See Foust, 325 S.C. at 13, 479 S.E.2d at 50; 41 \r\n  C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 179 (intent may be inferred when it is demonstrated \r\n  that the accused voluntarily and willfully commits an act, the natural tendency \r\n  of which is to destroy another's life). Coleman never asserted the gun fired \r\n  accidentally or that it fired without him pulling the trigger; nor is there \r\n  any apparent reason for Coleman's \"panic\" other than his own act of shooting \r\n  victim in the head. Coleman stated that after he entered the Subway with the \r\n  gun he \"got scared, and started to run and heard a shot.\" However, the physical \r\n  evidence in this case, the security videotape, directly contradicts Coleman's \r\n  statement that he first ran and then the gun fired. The smoke from the fired \r\n  gun is evident on the tape before Coleman runs out of the store. The \r\n  evidence establishes Coleman fired the gun because Victim did not give him the \r\n  money fast enough, not because of \"a sudden, overpowering terror.\"(3) \r\n  The only inference that can reasonably be drawn from the evidence is that Coleman \r\n  may well have panicked after shooting Victim, not before. Coleman's \r\n  assertion that he \"panicked,\" without more, and especially in light of the actual \r\n  chain of events as captured on the videotape, is palpably insufficient evidence \r\n  to justify a charge on ABHAN.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs no competent evidence exists that \r\n  Coleman committed only ABHAN rather than ABIK, it was not reversible error for \r\n  the trial judge to refuse to charge ABHAN. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the conviction. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWARD, J., concurs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in \r\n  a separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissenting: \r\n  I respectfully dissent.  \r\n   \r\nThe law to be charged is determined \r\n  by the evidence presented at trial.(4) The trial \r\n  judge must charge the jury on a lesser included offense if evidence is present \r\n  to sustain a conviction for a crime of a lesser degree.(5) \r\n  The judge should refuse to charge a lesser included offense only if no evidence \r\n  exists showing the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.(6) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nColeman was indicted for ABIK. ABIK \r\n  is an unlawful act of a violent nature to the person of another with malice \r\n  aforethought, either express or implied.(7) ABIK \r\n  also requires the intent to kill.(8) This intent \r\n  need only be a general intent demonstrated by acts and conduct from which a \r\n  jury may naturally and reasonably infer intent.(9) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nBy contrast, ABHAN requires an unlawful \r\n  act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.(10) \r\n  Such aggravating circumstances include the use of a deadly weapon, the infliction \r\n  of serious bodily injury, the intent to commit a felony, great disparity between \r\n  the ages and physical conditions of the parties involved, and the difference \r\n  in the sexes.(11)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn determining whether the evidence \r\n  required the judge to charge the jury on ABHAN, an appellate court must view \r\n  the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant.(12) \r\n  The issue in this case, then, is whether a jury could reasonably infer Coleman \r\n  lacked the requisite intent to kill Victim, thereby justifying a jury charge \r\n  on ABHAN.(13) \r\n   \r\nUpon examining the evidence of intent \r\n  in the light most favorable to Coleman, I would conclude a reasonable juror \r\n  could infer Coleman intended to commit assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature while lacking any intent to kill. First, ample evidence of aggravating \r\n  circumstances necessary for a conviction of ABHAN were present in this case, \r\n  including the use of a deadly weapon, the infliction of serious bodily injury, \r\n  and the intent to commit a felony.(14)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSecond, the State's own witness, \r\n  Erick Rodgers, testified Coleman intended to rob someone that day. Another \r\n  State witness, Travon McCoy, testified Coleman told him when he robbed Subway, \r\n  he panicked and shot Victim when Victim failed to turn over the money. Likewise, \r\n  the statement Coleman gave police prior to his arrest for this incident indicates \r\n  no intent to kill Victim. He told police that he got scared, started to run, \r\n  and heard a shot. Hence, all testimony indicated Coleman intended to rob Subway \r\n  and only shot Victim when he panicked. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"Panic\" is defined as \"a sudden, \r\n  overpowering terror.\"(15) The Pennsylvania Supreme \r\n  Court held in Commonwealth v. Stewart(16) \r\n  that terror-stricken panic may negate the mens rea element of murder in the \r\n  first degree. I, too, would hold that a person who panics could lack the capacity \r\n  to form an intent to kill.(17) Whether a jury \r\n  would believe Coleman's statement that he panicked and shot Victim is not for \r\n  us to say. By denying Coleman the charge of ABHAN where the State presented \r\n  evidence that he panicked, the majority deprives him of a fundamental right.(18) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nI believe the facts of this case \r\n  are more analogous to those in State v. Hilton.(19) \r\n  In Hilton, this court held appellant was entitled to a jury charge of \r\n  aggravated assault and battery where, like this case, the nature of appellant's \r\n  intent was very much in dispute. Appellant and victim were standing on a sidewalk \r\n  beside a railroad crossing. Two witnesses testified appellant pushed victim \r\n  in front of an oncoming train, but appellant maintained victim fell onto the \r\n  tracks. The trial judge refused to charge aggravated assault, stating that the \r\n  evidence either showed that appellant pushed victim onto the tracks with the \r\n  intent to kill him or that it was an accident. This court disagreed: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSince the same physical assault and \r\n  battery could legally constitute either the offense of [ABIK] or [ABHAN], it \r\n  became a jury question as to whether [appellant] entertained the specific intent \r\n  to kill [victim] at the time of the assault. Here, the jury was given only two \r\n  choices, a verdict of guilty of [ABIK] or acquittal. Where, as here, the jury \r\n  obviously finds that the physical act charged . . . was committed, they had \r\n  no alternative but to convict of the only crime placed before them. What their \r\n  decision might have been if confronted with the choice of two crimes, both of \r\n  which involved guilt of the act itself, but differed as to the intent with which \r\n  the act was committed, cannot be known.(20) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nBecause the jury in Coleman's case \r\n  faced the same dilemma as the jury in Hilton, i.e., convicting \r\n  him of ABIK or acquitting him, I would hold the trial judge erred in refusing \r\n  to charge the lesser included offense of ABHAN as there exists evidence a reasonable \r\n  jury could have determined Coleman lacked the intent to kill.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI would reverse and remand.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1.  We decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  The security \r\n  videotape of the incident shows that Coleman raised the gun level with Victim's \r\n  head just before he fired the shot. \r\n3.

ABIK requires \r\n  a showing of malice. Foust, 325 S.C. at 15, 479 S.E.2d at 51 (1996). \r\n  The absence of malice is not an element of ABHAN. State v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn September 1997, the Greenville \r\n  County Grand Jury indicted Thomason on one count of possession with intent to \r\n  distribute marijuana for an incident that occurred in Greenville County on October \r\n  9, 1996. \r\n   \r\nOn October 16, 1997, the State Grand \r\n  Jury indicted Thomason on one count of \"trafficking in marijuana (conspiracy)\" \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(1)(b). The indictment charged Thomason \r\n  with conspiring to transport at least one hundred pounds but less than two thousand \r\n  pounds of marijuana into the state, from 1989 until the date of the indictment. \r\n  The indictment alleged the conspiracy took place in Spartanburg, Greenville, \r\n  Anderson, and Pickens counties. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThomason pled guilty in the Greenville \r\n  County Circuit Court on January 20, 1998 to the indictment charging him with \r\n  possession with intent to distribute marijuana. The circuit court sentenced \r\n  him to five years in prison, suspended upon three years probation with the condition \r\n  that he pass all drug tests. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn August 18, 1998, Thomason and \r\n  his attorney signed a plea agreement regarding the State Grand Jury charge of \r\n  trafficking in marijuana. The agreement allowed Thomason to plead guilty to \r\n  trafficking at least ten pounds but less than one hundred pounds of marijuana, \r\n  rather than the amount charged in the indictment of at least one hundred pounds \r\n  but less than two thousand pounds of marijuana. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThomason formally entered a guilty \r\n  plea in Spartanburg County Circuit Court pursuant to the plea agreement, after \r\n  unsuccessfully moving to dismiss the indictment based on his claim of double \r\n  jeopardy. The circuit court accepted Thomason's plea. At a subsequent hearing, \r\n  the circuit court sentenced Thomason to ten years in prison and fined him $10,000 \r\n  on this charge. \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThomason appeals, arguing the circuit \r\n  court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge of trafficking in marijuana \r\n  based on double jeopardy. We conclude Thomason waived any double jeopardy claim \r\n  by pleading guilty. \r\n   \r\nA guilty plea generally acts as a \r\n  waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses. State v. Munsch, \r\n  287 S.C. 313, 338 S.E.2d 329 (1985). The plea admits all elements of the offense \r\n  charged, \"leaves open for review only the sufficiency of the indictment and \r\n  waives all other defenses.\" Id. at 314, 338 S.E.2d at 330; cf. \r\n  United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569 (1989) (\"A plea of guilty and \r\n  the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary \r\n  to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilty and a lawful sentence. Accordingly, \r\n  when the judgment of conviction upon a guilty plea has become final and the \r\n  offender seeks to reopen the proceeding, the inquiry is ordinarily confined \r\n  to whether the underlying plea was both counseled and voluntary. If the answer \r\n  is in the affirmative then the conviction and the plea, as a general rule, foreclose \r\n  the collateral attack.\"). \r\n   \r\nThe State Grand Jury indictment alleged \r\n  Thomason conspired to traffic in marijuana from 1989 until October 16, 1997, \r\n  the date of the indictment. The Greenville County Grand Jury indictment alleged \r\n  that Thomason possessed marijuana with intent to distribute on October 9, 1996. \r\n  During the plea hearing, Thomason essentially asserted that the trafficking \r\n  charge and the possession charge arose from the same quantity of marijuana, \r\n  fourteen pounds. The State, however, argued the trafficking charge alleged an \r\n  unlawful agreement to commit an unlawful act in four counties, which is separate \r\n  and distinct from the substantive offense of possession with intent to distribute \r\n  in Greenville County alone. The State further argued it could establish at trial \r\n  that Thomason was involved with more than the fourteen pounds purportedly involved \r\n  in the possession charge. \r\n   \r\nThe circuit court denied Thomason's \r\n  motion to dismiss the indictment based on the allegation of double jeopardy, \r\n  noting the indictment charged Thomason with trafficking at least one hundred \r\n  pounds but less than two thousand pounds of marijuana, and the charge was \"legal \r\n  on its face.\" Thomason thereafter pled guilty to the trafficking charge based \r\n  on at least ten pounds but less than one hundred pounds of marijuana as provided \r\n  in the plea agreement. When the circuit court advised Thomason that by pleading \r\n  guilty he was waiving his right to the double jeopardy claim and a trial by \r\n  jury, Thomason stated he understood. The circuit court accepted the plea, finding \r\n  the \"plea to be freely, voluntarily, and certainly thoughtfully and intelligently \r\n  entered.\" \r\n   \r\nBy entering a guilty plea, Thomason \r\n  admitted the circumstances described in the trafficking indictment. The State \r\n  allowed Thomason to plead to a reduced quantity in accordance with the terms \r\n  of the plea agreement. Thomason's waiver of the double jeopardy claim resulted \r\n  in a favorable plea bargain, and he does not contend his plea was unknowing \r\n  and involuntary. See State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 292 S.E.2d \r\n  598 (1982) (absent a timely objection at the plea proceeding, the unknowing \r\n  and involuntary nature of a guilty plea may properly be attacked only through \r\n  the more appropriate means of post-conviction relief). Accordingly, by pleading \r\n  guilty instead of proceeding to trial and attempting to show the existence of \r\n  only one offense, Thomason waived his double jeopardy claim. See Kelly \r\n  v. State, 274 S.C. 613, 615, 266 S.E.2d 417, 418 (1980) (holding a \"counselled \r\n  plea of guilty, knowingly and intelligently entered pursuant to a favorable \r\n  plea bargain, waives a plea of former jeopardy\"); see also State v. \r\n  Truesdale, 278 S.C. 368, 296 S.E.2d 528 (1982) (holding it is improper for \r\n  a defendant to seek to preserve constitutional issues while entering a plea \r\n  of guilty because the plea waives all prior claims of constitutional rights \r\n  or deprivations thereof). \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThomason, however, argues a guilty \r\n  plea does not waive a double jeopardy claim. Thomason specifically cites Menna \r\n  v. New York, 423 U.S. 61 (1975), wherein the Court held, \"[w]here the State \r\n  is precluded by the United States Constitution from haling a defendant into \r\n  court on a charge, federal law requires that a conviction on that charge be \r\n  set aside even if the conviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of \r\n  guilty.\" Id. at 62. We find the Menna holding does not apply to \r\n  the facts of this case. \r\n   \r\nWhile the Menna Court held \r\n  that, under certain circumstances, a defendant does not waive a double jeopardy \r\n  claim, the Court refused to hold that a defendant never can waive a double jeopardy \r\n  claim. The Court instead limited its holding and stated \"that a plea of guilty \r\n  to a charge does not waive a claim that - judged on its face - the charge is \r\n  one which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\" Id. at 63 n.2. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn United States v. Broce, \r\n  488 U.S. 563 (1989), the Court stated the trial judge in Menna should \r\n  have made a determination that the second charge could not go forward at the \r\n  time the plea was entered based on the record because the defendant's plea amounted \r\n  to a redundant confession of the earlier offense. The Court held where the indictments \r\n  on their face describe separate offenses and the defendant cannot prove his \r\n  claim of double jeopardy by only relying on the indictments and the existing \r\n  record, the plea admits the factual allegations and the defendant waives any \r\n  double jeopardy claim. Broce, 488 U.S. at 575-76. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased on the analysis in Broce, \r\n  the holding in Menna only applies in the very limited circumstances where \r\n  it is clear from the face of the indictment and the record before the circuit \r\n  court that the second charge is the same as a previous charge. In such circumstances, \r\n  admitting guilt to the second charge is, in effect, a redundant confession. \r\n  In all other circumstances, i.e., where the factual allegations in the indictments \r\n  charge two distinct offenses on their face and it is necessary to go beyond \r\n  the indictments and the immediate record to determine the validity of the claim, \r\n  the defendant waives the double jeopardy claim by pleading guilty. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, there is no way to \r\n  determine, without going outside the indictments and the record before the circuit \r\n  court, whether the same marijuana was involved in both the trafficking and possession \r\n  offenses. We, therefore, conclude Thomason waived his double jeopardy claim \r\n  by pleading guilty and thereby admitting the factual allegations in the indictments. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
