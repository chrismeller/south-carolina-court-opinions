David Scott, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nTeresa A. Knox, Deputy Director of Legal Services, Tommy Evans, \r\n  Jr., Legal Counsel and Legal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, all of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  John Cannon appeals from an \r\n  order requiring him to submit a DNA sample as a condition of his parole.Â  Cannon \r\n  argues the statute was amended to exclude him from the DNA requirement and forcing \r\n  him to provide a sample violates the ex post facto clauses \r\n  of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCannon was convicted of murder in April \r\n  1972 and was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  He subsequently pled guilty to \r\n  two additional counts of murder and received concurrent life sentences for those \r\n  two counts.Â  All three murder counts arose out of the same occurrence.Â  \r\nOn October 12, 1983, the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services (the â€œDepartmentâ€) released Cannon \r\n  from prison.Â  He was to remain under the Departmentâ€™s supervision for the remainder \r\n  of his life and was required to â€œcarry out all instructions [his parole agent] \r\n  gives,â€ but was not required to submit a blood sample as a condition of his \r\n  release.Â  Twelve years later, South Carolina enacted the State Deoxyribonucleic \r\n  Acid Identification Record Database Act (the â€œDNA Actâ€), found in sections 23-3-600 \r\n  to 700 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003), which require a person â€œcurrently \r\n  paroled and remaining under supervision of the Stateâ€ to provide a DNA sample \r\n  as a condition of his or her parole.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620(C) (Supp. 1995); \r\n  Act No. 497, 1994 S.C. Acts 5816-5817.Â  In July 2000, the DNA Act was amended \r\n  to require a DNA sample from a person â€œconvicted or adjudicated delinquent before \r\n  July 1, 2000, who is serving a probated sentence or is paroled on or after July \r\n  1, 2000.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620(E) (Supp. 2003).Â  In February 2001, the \r\n  Department notified Cannon that he was required by law to provide a DNA sample \r\n  as a condition of his parole and failure to do so would be considered a violation \r\n  of his parole.\r\nIn March 2002, Cannon instituted a declaratory \r\n  judgment action, seeking a determination whether the DNA Act requires, as a \r\n  condition of his parole, that he submit a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA \r\n  database.Â  Cannon also sought and was granted a temporary restraining order \r\n  precluding the Department from requiring him to submit a DNA sample while the \r\n  case was pending in court.\r\nA non-jury trial was convened on May 27, 2003.Â  \r\n  On August 1, 2003, Judge Barber signed an order finding the DNA Act applied \r\n  to Cannon and required him to submit a DNA sample as a condition of his parole.Â  \r\n  Judge Barber also determined the DNA Act did not violate the ex post \r\n  facto clause of the United States Constitution.Â  On August 19, 2003, \r\n  Cannon filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 52 and \r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which was denied on September 10, 2003.Â  Cannon appeals.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWe have held that where a law case is tried by \r\n  a judge without a jury, his findings of fact have the force and effect of a \r\n  jury verdict upon the issues, and are conclusive upon appeal when supported \r\n  by competent evidence.â€Â  Chapman v. Allstate Ins. Co., 263 S.C. 565, \r\n  567, 211 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1975).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Statutory Construction&nbsp; \r\nCannon claims the DNA Act does not require him \r\n  to submit a DNA sample as a condition of his parole because he was released \r\n  on parole prior to July 1, 2000.Â  We disagree.\r\nCannon argues the trial court erred by determining \r\n  the word â€œparoledâ€ is synonymous with the phrase â€œremaining on parole on or \r\n  after July 1, 2000â€ because the legislature excluded the phrase â€œremaining under \r\n  supervisionâ€ from the amended statute.Â  Cannon asserts the 2000 amendments to \r\n  the statute materially changed the DNA Act by substituting language that requires \r\n  DNA samples from only those persons convicted of the specified offenses who \r\n  are â€œparoled on or after July 1, 2000.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-620(E) (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  Cannon concludes the legislature intended a departure from the original \r\n  law by excluding those offenders paroled prior to the effective date of the \r\n  amendment, and therefore he is not required to provide a DNA sample under the \r\n  amended act because he was paroled prior to July 1, 2000.\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.â€Â  Strother \r\n  v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, \r\n  121 (1998).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one \r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the \r\n  intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, \r\n  Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).Â  While the â€œwords used \r\n  [in a statute] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort \r\n  to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its operation[, t]he language \r\n  must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords \r\n  with its general purpose.â€Â  Hitachi Data Systems Corp. v. Leatherman, \r\n  309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  â€œHowever plain the ordinary \r\n  meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning \r\n  when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not \r\n  possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative \r\n  intention.â€Â  Kiriakides, 312 S.C. at 275, 440 S.E.2d at 366.Â  Â Â \r\nThe stated purpose of the DNA Act is to â€œdevelop \r\n  DNA profiles on samples for law enforcement purposes and for humanitarian and \r\n  non-law enforcement purposes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-610 (Supp. 2003).Â  Section \r\n  23-3-620 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) lists the classes of offenders \r\n  who are required by the act to provide a DNA sample for the DNA database and \r\n  states when the samples are to be taken.Â  In particular, the revised statuteâ€™s \r\n  section (C) pertains to an individual who is in prison and has not been released \r\n  on parole, and section (E) pertains to an individual who has already been released \r\n  on parole.\r\nWhile the revised statuteâ€™s meaning is not clear \r\n  on its face, when section 23-3-620(C)(1) and (E)(1) of the South Carolina Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003) are read in tandem, it becomes apparent that the legislature intended \r\n  to require individuals who were placed on parole prior to July 1, 2000 and who \r\n  are still on parole after July 1, 2000 to provide a DNA sample as a condition \r\n  of their parole.Â  \r\nSection 23-3-620(C)(1) requires an individual who \r\n  is serving a term of confinement on or after July 1, 2000 to submit a DNA sample \r\n  as a prerequisite of his or her parole, should they be released on parole in \r\n  the future.Â  Section 23-3-620(E)(1) requires that an individual who is paroled \r\n  on July 1, 2000 or later also submit a DNA sample as a condition of their parole.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Cannonâ€™s interpretation of the statute, which would only require \r\n  a sample from individuals granted parole after July 1, 2000, renders section \r\n  23-3-620(E)(1) duplicative of section (C) because under section (C) those same \r\n  individuals would have already given a sample before being released.\r\nThus, when read as a whole, section 23-3-620 appears \r\n  to have been intended to cover all individuals who commit the enumerated crimes, \r\n  including those already in prison or out on parole.Â  Construing the statute \r\n  in light of its intended purpose, there is no logical reason why Cannon and \r\n  other similarly situated individuals should be excluded from the statuteâ€™s requirements.Â  \r\n  To do so would result in the exclusion of a large number of individuals and \r\n  would frustrate the purpose of the legislation, which is to create an extensive \r\n  DNA database.Â  \r\nBecause such an exception does not appear to have \r\n  been intended by the legislature and there is evidence to support the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s findings of fact, the trial court was correct in concluding that individuals \r\n  who were placed on parole prior to July 1, 2000, and who are still on parole \r\n  after July 1, 2000, are required by section 23-3-620 of the South Carolina Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003) to provide a DNA sample for the State DNA Database.Â  \r\nII.Â  Ex Post Facto  Clause&nbsp; \r\nCannon also claims extending his term of incarceration \r\n  solely because of his failure to provide a DNA sample violates the ex \r\n  post facto clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWhile both the United States \r\n  and South Carolina Constitutions specifically prohibit ex post \r\n  facto laws, two critical elements must be present for a law to fall within \r\n  the prohibition: (1) the law must apply to events that occurred before its enactment, \r\n  and (2) the offender of the law must be disadvantaged by the law.Â  State \r\n  v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 30, 558 S.E.2d 524, 525 (2002).Â  Additionally, â€œ[f]or \r\n  the ex post facto clause to be applicable, the statute \r\n  or the provision in question must be criminal or penal in purpose and nature.â€Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nThe DNA Act meets the two elements of the ex \r\n  post facto prohibition because the act applies to individuals \r\n  who were placed on parole prior to the July 1, 2000 amendment, and Cannon has \r\n  been disadvantaged because his parole will be revoked if he fails to provide \r\n  a DNA sample; however, the ex post facto clause is not \r\n  applicable because the actâ€™s purpose and nature is not criminal or penal.\r\nâ€œ[T]he determination whether a statute is civil \r\n  or criminal is primarily a question of statutory construction, which must begin \r\n  by reference to the actâ€™s text and legislative history.â€Â  In re Matthews, \r\n  345 S.C. 638, 648, 550 S.E.2d 311, 316 (2001).Â  â€œWhere the legislature has manifested \r\n  its intent that the legislation is civil in nature, the party challenging that \r\n  classification must provide â€˜the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is \r\n  so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the [legislatureâ€™s] intention.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Id. (quoting Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001)).Â  \r\nSection 23-3-610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. \r\n  2003) states the DNA Actâ€™s purpose is to â€œdevelop DNA profiles on samples for \r\n  law enforcement purposes and for humanitarian and non-law enforcement purposes, \r\n  as provided for in Section 23-3-640(B).â€Â  Section 23-3-640(B) lists seven uses \r\n  for a DNA sample collected under the DNA Act:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;to develop a convicted offender database \r\n  to identify suspects in otherwise nonsuspect cases;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (2)&nbsp;\r\n         to develop a population database when personal \r\n  identifying information is removed;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         to support identification research and protocol \r\n  development of forensic DNA analysis methods;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (4)&nbsp;\r\n         to generate investigative leads in criminal \r\n  investigations;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (5)\r\n         for quality control or quality assurance \r\n  purposes, or both;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (6)&nbsp;\r\n         to assist in the recovery and identification \r\n  of human remains from mass disasters;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         (7)&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;for other humanitarian purposes including \r\n  identification of missing persons.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-640 (Supp. 2003).Â  Thus, the legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent was to create a statute that is civil in nature, and Cannon must prove \r\n  the DNA Act is so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intention.Â \r\nWhile this is an issue of first impression in South Carolina, \r\n  it is not unique in terms of litigation concerning DNA acts across the nation. \r\n  [1] Â  Inmates who were required to provide a DNA sample under Virginiaâ€™s \r\n  DNA act attacked the constitutionality of the state statute on ex post \r\n  facto grounds.Â  Jones v. Murray, 962 F.2d 302, 308 (4th Cir. 1992).Â  \r\n  The court held that Virginiaâ€™s requirement that inmates provide a DNA sample \r\n  is not punitive in nature and the testing itself did not violate the ex \r\n  post facto clause.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the court held that \r\n  the statuteâ€™s possible effect of â€œauthorizing prison punishment, the denial \r\n  of good-time credits, or consideration by the parole board in granting discretionary \r\n  parole to compel the inmate to provide a sample, [does not violate the ex \r\n  post facto clause] because it does not thereby alter any prisonerâ€™s \r\n  sentence for past conduct.â€Â  Id. at 310.\r\nBecause the South Carolina legislatureâ€™s intent \r\n  appears to have been to protect the public, and not to punish those individuals \r\n  who commit or have committed the specified crimes, South Carolinaâ€™s DNA Act \r\n  is non-punitive and does not constitute a criminal penalty.Â  Cf. Walls, \r\n  348 S.C. at 31, 558 S.E.2d at 526 (holding the sex offender registry was intended \r\n  to protect the public from sex offenders who may re-offend and to aid law enforcement, \r\n  not to punish offenders).Â  Also, Cannon has failed to provide any evidence that \r\n  the DNA Act is so punitive in effect as to negate the legislatureâ€™s intent to \r\n  create a civil statute.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial judge was correct in determining \r\n  the DNA Act does not violate the ex post facto clauses \r\n  of the United States or South Carolina Constitutions.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The courts in the following cases determined DNA database statutes \r\n    are not penal in nature and do not violate the ex post facto \r\n    clauses: Gilbert v.

Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Don Reno Walton pled guilty \r\n  to charges of distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of crack cocaine \r\n  within proximity of a school.Â  He appeals, arguing the circuit court did not \r\n  have subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea to distribution within \r\n  proximity of a school.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nAt the plea proceeding, Walton waived presentment \r\n  in writing and pled guilty to both of the above charges.Â  The charges stemmed \r\n  from his alleged sale of crack cocaine to a confidential informant on or about \r\n  April 3, 2001 in York County.Â  Walton was sentenced to time served and ordered \r\n  to pay a $10,000 fine for the distribution charge.Â  On the proximity charge, \r\n  Walton was sentenced to ten years in prison, suspended upon time served and \r\n  three years probation, and fined $10,000.Â  The court ordered the sentences to \r\n  run consecutively.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Walton contends for the first time that \r\n  the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea \r\n  to distribution of crack cocaine within proximity of a school because the indictment \r\n  described the nearby school as the â€œYork Adult Education Center.â€ Walton asserts \r\n  the center is not a type of school specifically included in the applicable statute.\r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict a defendant of a criminal offense if (1) there has been an indictment \r\n  that sufficiently states the offense, (2) there has been a written waiver of \r\n  presentment, or (3) the charge is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged \r\n  in the indictment.Â  Cutner v. State, 354 S.C. 151, 580 S.E.2d 120 (2003).Â  \r\n  The lack of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time and can be \r\n  raised sua sponte by the court.Â  State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 572 \r\n  S.E.2d 309 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nSection 44-53-445 provides that it shall \r\n  be unlawful to distribute a controlled substance â€œwithin a one-half mile radius \r\n  of the grounds of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school; \r\n  a public playground or park; a public vocational or trade school or technical \r\n  educational center; or a public or private college or university.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(A) (2002).\r\nIn this case, the indictment for the proximity \r\n  charge alleged Walton distributed â€œa controlled substance, to wit:Â  crack cocaine, \r\n  within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of York Adult Education Center, \r\n  a public school located in the city of York, South Carolina, . . . in \r\n  violation of Section 44-53-445, Code of Laws of South Carolina (1976), as \r\n  amended.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\nWalton argues the indictment is fatally \r\n  flawed because the York Adult Education Center is not specifically included \r\n  among the types of qualifying schools listed in the statute, citing Brown \r\n  v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001).Â  In Brown, the indictment \r\n  alleged that the distribution occurred within proximity of a day-care center.Â  \r\n  Our supreme court found the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to accept the defendantâ€™s guilty plea because day-care centers were not specifically \r\n  included among the types of schools listed in the statute.Â  \r\nIn the current appeal, the indictment alleges the \r\n  distribution of crack cocaine occurred within a half-mile radius of a public \r\n  school in violation of section 44-53-445, and names the institution, â€œYork Adult \r\n  Education Center.â€Â  \r\nAlthough the indictment alleges the institution \r\n  is a â€œpublic school,â€ it does not otherwise specify whether it is a secondary \r\n  school or a vocational, trade, or technical school, all of which are qualifying \r\n  institutions under the statute.Â  See Brown, 343 S.C. at 349, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d at 850 (stating â€œsection 44-53-445 does not simply criminalize distribution \r\n  within proximity of a â€˜school,â€™ but instead very specifically lists the \r\n  types of schools coveredâ€).Â  In State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d \r\n  745 (2001), however, our supreme court held that â€œ[w]hile the better practice \r\n  is to set forth the elements of the crime in the indictment rather than referring \r\n  to the statutory section alleged to have been violated,â€ an indictment was sufficient \r\n  to provide the defendant with notice of the elements of the offense where it \r\n  referenced the appropriate statute.Â  Id. at 649, 552 S.E.2d at 751.Â  \r\n  The indictment against Walton clearly alleges the distribution occurred within \r\n  a half-mile radius of a public school in violation of section 44-53-445; thus, \r\n  we find the indictment sufficiently gave Watkins notice that the distribution \r\n  allegedly occurred at a public school that was within the terms of the statute.Â  \r\n\r\nWe also hold Watkins waived any argument about \r\n  whether the indictment sufficiently stated the offense to confer jurisdiction \r\n  on the court since he signed a written waiver of presentment.Â  In Hooks v. \r\n  State, 353 S.C. 48, 577 S.E.2d 211 (2003), our supreme court noted as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nTwo exceptions apply to the general rule that an indictment \r\n  must sufficiently state the offense to confer jurisdiction on a court.Â  The \r\n  first applies if the defendant waives presentment.Â  The second applies where \r\n  the charge to which the defendant pleads guilty is a lesser-included offense \r\n  of the crime charged in the indictment.\r\n\r\nId. at 51 n.2, 577 S.E.2d at 213 n.2 (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\nAFFIRMED. [2] \r\nANDERSON and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Because oral argument would not aid the Court in resolving the issue \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Although our supreme court has had several cases raising the issue \r\n    of subject-matter jurisdiction in this context, we note that, in a case involving \r\n    the issue of a directed verdict, this court inferred that the question whether \r\n    or not the York Adult Education Center fell within the scope of the statute \r\n    was a question of fact for a jury to determine.

\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Michael Truitt and \r\n  Sandra Ivester appeal the termination of their parental rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSandra Ivester and Michael Truitt are the parents \r\n  of three childrenâ€”Gabriel, Elijah, and Alexis.Â  Although the two have been romantically \r\n  involved for eight years, they never married.Â  When this action commenced, Gabriel \r\n  and Elijah were eighteen months old and Alexis was six months old.Â  \r\nOn June 10, 2001, Sandra took the children to have \r\n  Sunday dinner at Michaelâ€™s parentsâ€™ house.Â  After dinner, while Sandra and her \r\n  children were napping, Michael borrowed Sandraâ€™s car and went to visit friends.Â  \r\n  Later, he returned to the house and asked Sandra to accompany him as he dropped \r\n  off his friends.Â  Sandra agreed to go, left her children with their grandparents, \r\n  and told them she would be back in approximately fifteen minutes. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nSandra and Michael did not return home in fifteen \r\n  minutes.Â  In fact, they had not returned by the next morning.Â  Because Michaelâ€™s \r\n  mother had to work and his father suffered from medical difficulties, neither \r\n  was able to care for the children. \r\n  [2] Â  Having tried to contact Sandra and Michael numerous times, the grandparents \r\n  were left with no option but to call the Department of Social Services (â€œDSSâ€).Â Â  \r\n  Corporal Miller, of the Mauldin Police Department, testified that when he arrived \r\n  at the Truittâ€™s home on Monday he made further attempts to locate the childrenâ€™s \r\n  parents, but was unsuccessful.Â  Lacking proper supervision, the children were \r\n  taken into emergency protective custody.Â  \r\nAfter Sandra and Michael left his parentâ€™s house \r\n  on Sunday, Michael allowed a couple of â€œfriendsâ€ to borrow Sandraâ€™s car in exchange \r\n  for $100.00 of crack cocaine.Â  While the car was gone, both parents smoked the \r\n  crack at another friendâ€™s apartment.Â  Neither parent attempted to contact the \r\n  grandparents until after DSS took custody of the children.Â  When they finally \r\n  did call Monday afternoon, they were informed that DSS removed the children.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSandra testified she did not return on Sunday to \r\n  pick up the children because Michaelâ€™s friends never brought back the car.Â  \r\n  She also testified she did not call the grandparents because there was no telephone \r\n  in the apartment where they were staying.Â  Sandra explained that a number of \r\n  Mauldin police officers lived in the area, and she was afraid if she left the \r\n  apartment to find a telephone then she would be picked up on outstanding warrants.Â  \r\n\r\nEven though both were fully aware DSS had their \r\n  children, for the next two months Sandra and Michael spent their time living \r\n  in motel rooms and smoking crack every other day.Â  They called Michaelâ€™s parents \r\n  from time to time to ask for money and talk about the children, but otherwise \r\n  did not attempt to contact their children or DSS despite testimony that they \r\n  knew the name of their caseworker.Â Â  The authorities did not locate Sandra and \r\n  Michael until they were arrested, living in a hotel, on August 14, 2001.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing their arrest, Sandra did not request \r\n  visitation with her children until the first week of October 2001.Â  She cancelled \r\n  the first scheduled visitation and did not actually meet with the children until \r\n  October 25, 2001, more than four months after the children were left with their \r\n  grandparents.Â  Michael never contacted DSS to seek visitation or to check on \r\n  the childrenâ€™s welfare.Â  Thus, DSS initiated this termination of parental rights \r\n  (â€œTPRâ€) action on July 26, 2001.Â  \r\nAt the time of the hearing, Sandra was released \r\n  from jail and working in a family catering business.Â  Although Michael was still \r\n  incarcerated, he expected to be released from custody at the end of 2003.Â  The \r\n  children were placed with a foster family who expressed interest in adopting \r\n  all three children.Â  \r\nSignificantly, this was not the first time DSS \r\n  became involved in the childrenâ€™s lives.Â  In October 2000, Michael left Gabriel \r\n  and Elijahâ€”then eleven months oldâ€”home alone while he went to purchase illegal \r\n  drugs.Â  Sandra was incarcerated at the time and unable to watch the children.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Gabriel and Elijah were taken into emergency protective custody.Â  \r\n  DSS filed an action concerning this incident and an Order was issued on February \r\n  21, 2001, which made a â€œfinding of threat of harm of physical neglectâ€ against \r\n  Michael and ordered treatment plans for both parents.Â  The order granted custody \r\n  to Sandra, but only granted Michael supervised visitation.Â  Although Sandra \r\n  completed the treatment plans outlined in the order, Michael did not.Â  The third \r\n  child, Alexis, was born in December 2000; therefore, the previous court order \r\n  did not address custody or visitation rights as they pertained to her.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn a termination of parental rights \r\n  (TPR) case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€Â  \r\n  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (citing South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. \r\n  129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  Before a parentâ€™s rights may \r\n  be terminated, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and \r\n  convincing evidence.Â  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Mrs. H, 346 S.C. 329, 333, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court may review the record \r\n  and make its own determination of whether the grounds for termination are supported \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.; see also South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d \r\n  506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, despite this broad scope of review, this \r\n  court is not required to disregard the findings of the family court nor ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to evaluate the credibility \r\n  of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  This is especially true in cases involving the welfare of children.Â  \r\n  Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s termination of parental \r\n  rights statute, â€œ[t]he family court may order the termination of parental rights \r\n  upon a finding of one or more of the [listed] grounds and a finding that termination \r\n  is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003). \r\n  [3] Â  If the family court finds a statutory ground for termination has been \r\n  proven, it must then find the best interests of the children would be served \r\n  by termination.Â  Id.Â Â  Significantly, as our supreme court has noted \r\n  and the TPR statute provides: â€œTPR statutes â€˜must be liberally construed in \r\n  order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the \r\n  custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent[-]child relationship.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 108, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 \r\n  (2000) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 1999)).\r\nIn the current case, the family court determined \r\n  that Michael and Sandra abandoned their three children.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(7) (Supp. 2003).Â  As an alternative ground, the court ruled \r\n  that Michaelâ€™s rights should also be terminated because of harm inflicted on \r\n  the children pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(1) (Supp. 2003). [4] Â  After finding statutory grounds for termination, \r\n  the family court determined it would be in the childrenâ€™s best interest for \r\n  Sandra and Michaelâ€™s parental rights to be terminated.Â  \r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abandonment  \r\nThe family court found that Michael and Sandra \r\n  abandoned their three children.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572(7) of the South Carolina Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003) provides in pertinent part, that a family court may order the termination \r\n  of parental rights upon a finding of abandonment.Â  Section 20-7-490(19) defines \r\n  abandonment as occurring when â€œa parent or guardian wilfully deserts a child \r\n  or wilfully surrenders physical possession of a child without making adequate \r\n  arrangements for the childâ€™s needs or the continuing care of the child.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490 (Supp. 2003).Â  The willful standard for termination has \r\n  been explained as â€œa question of intent to be determined from the facts and \r\n  circumstances of each individual case.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 610, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423&nbsp;(2003).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  parental conduct â€œwhich evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties \r\n  may fairly be characterized as â€˜willfulâ€™ because it manifests a conscious indifference \r\n  to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€Â  \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d \r\n  835, 839&nbsp;(1992). \r\nWe do not think the family court erred in deciding \r\n  that Michael and Sandraâ€™s actions constituted a willful intent to abandon.Â  \r\n  As noted previously, both Michael and Sandra were aware the grandparents were \r\n  unable to care for the children for extended periods of time.Â Â Â  Michaelâ€™s mother \r\n  specifically told them she was leaving Sunday evening for an engagement, both \r\n  knew she had to work the next day, and both knew that Mr. Truitt was unable \r\n  to care for the children.Â  Despite this knowledge, neither made an effort to \r\n  return to the Truittsâ€™ and resume care of their children.Â  Although the parents \r\n  assert they did not have access to a car, both must admit it was their decision \r\n  to trade the use of the car for drugs.Â  The fact that the carâ€™s borrowers did \r\n  not promptly return the car does not serve to mitigate the parentsâ€™ failure \r\n  to find a way home to their children.Â  \r\nThe parents also argue that they did not call to \r\n  check on their children or ask the grandparents for a ride home because the \r\n  apartment they were staying in did not have a telephone and they feared being \r\n  arrested if they left the apartment.Â  The mother appears to be saying that by \r\n  not taking the risk of being arrested on outstanding warrants she was watching \r\n  out for her childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  This argument, however, is incomprehensible.Â  \r\n  She knew the grandparents could not provide for her children for an extended \r\n  period of time and she promised to be back in fifteen minutes for this reason.Â  \r\n  Clearly, Sandra broke this promise by embarking on a course of illegal behavior \r\n  that would necessarily take longer than fifteen minutes.Â  \r\nWhen the parents finally did call and were told the \r\n  children had been taken into emergency protective custody, neither made an effort \r\n  to contact DSS in an attempt to regain custody or at the very least to check \r\n  on their childrenâ€™s welfare.Â  Instead, the parents proceeded to spend the next \r\n  two months living in hotel rooms and using crack cocaine every other day.Â  In \r\n  fact, the only thing that prevented the parents from continuing this course \r\n  of behavior was their arrest on August 14, 2001.Â  Prior to the arrest, the parentsâ€™ \r\n  concern with their children was limited to an occasional call to the grandparents.\r\nMichael argues that because a previous court order \r\n  granted legal custody of two of their children to Sandra, it was not possible \r\n  for him to abandon them.Â  We are unconvinced by this argument.Â  Michael did \r\n  have access to the children and he testified that he saw them everyday.Â  While \r\n  Michael did not have legal custody of the children, he did have the right to \r\n  supervised visitation even though he did not pursue this right.Â  In fact, he \r\n  did not make any effort whatsoever to contact his children from the time they \r\n  were abandoned on June 10, 2001, until his rights were terminated on November \r\n  28, 2001.Â  Furthermore, this absence was the result of his decisions, which \r\n  placed his desires and needs above those of his children.Â  See Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Henry, 296 S.C. 507, 509, 374 S.E.2d 298, 299-300 (1988) \r\n  (finding â€œvoluntary pursuit of a course of lawlessness resulting in imprisonment, \r\n  coupled with [the parentâ€™s] flagrant indifference towards the children during \r\n  intervening periods of freedom, manifest[ed] . . . abandonmentâ€).Â  In addition \r\n  to removing himself from his childrenâ€™s lives, he encouraged Sandra to abandon \r\n  them as well.Â  Michaelâ€™s actions do not show concern and attention for his childrenâ€™s \r\n  welfare; rather, they reflect a conscious indifference to the same.\r\nAlthough the family court also \r\n  found Michaelâ€™s parental rights should be terminated pursuant to section 20-7-1572(1) \r\n  of the South Carolina Code, (Supp. 2003), because we find the trial court was \r\n  correct in concluding the children were abandoned, we need not address this \r\n  aspect of the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Rule 220 (c), SCACR; Futch v. McAllister \r\n  Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) \r\n  (appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior \r\n  issue is dispositive).\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Interests of the Children  \r\nIn addition to finding Michael and Sandra abandoned \r\n  their children, the family court concluded that termination of their parental \r\n  rights would be in the childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  We agree.\r\nGovernmental intervention in a parent-child relationship \r\n  is of great moment and concern.Â  The United States Supreme Court has held that \r\n  â€œa parentâ€™s desire for and right to â€˜the companionship, care, custody and management \r\n  of his or her childrenâ€™ is an important interest that â€˜undeniably warrants deference \r\n  and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.â€™â€Â  Lassiter v. \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. of Durham County, N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 27 (1981) (quoting \r\n  Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972)).Â  Societyâ€™s fundamental \r\n  relational basis is the family, and a government is wise that respects its importance.Â  \r\n  See M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996) (â€œChoices about \r\n  marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children are among associational \r\n  rights this Court has ranked as â€˜of basic importance in our society,â€™ rights \r\n  sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the Stateâ€™s unwarranted usurpation, \r\n  disregard, or disrespect.â€) (citation omitted).Â  However, the primary goal must \r\n  be to protect the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 \r\n  S.C. 281, 295, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999).Â  \r\nIn this case, reversing the family court would \r\n  return the children to a father who repeatedly deserted his children to fulfill \r\n  his drug addiction, failed to fulfill his obligations under a previous court \r\n  order, and encouraged the mother to desert her children.Â  It would also return \r\n  the children to a mother who deserted her children for more than four months, \r\n  and has a drug addiction, a criminal history, and remained in a relationship \r\n  with a father who previously neglected their children.Â  To affirm the decision \r\n  is to free the children from the bonds of foster care and allow them the opportunity \r\n  to be adopted into a stable and nurturing home.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough the preference of the law is to return \r\n  children to their parents, the presumption that a natural parent is a fit parent \r\n  must be balanced against reality.Â  See Troxel v. Granville, 530 \r\n  U.S. 57, 69 (2000) (noting the traditional presumption that a fit \r\n  parent will act in the best interests of a child) (emphasis added).Â  The United \r\n  States Supreme Court has stated that â€œso long as a parent adequately cares for \r\n  his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason \r\n  for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family . . . .â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 68 (citation omitted).Â  In this case, Sandra and Michael failed \r\n  to care for their children.Â  The reality we confront today is of a mother and \r\n  father who have demonstrated a gross indifference to the welfare of their children.Â  \r\n  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Ledford, 357 S.C. 371, \r\n  377, 593 S.E.2d 175, 177 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œa parentâ€™s responsibility extends \r\n  beyond making initial arrangements for his or her child while the parent is \r\n  away; the statute requires that the parent make adequate arrangements for the \r\n  childâ€™s continuing care.â€).Â  As such, we find it is in the childrenâ€™s \r\n  best interest to terminate Michael and Sandraâ€™s parental rights. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we find the family \r\n  court did not err in ruling Michael and Sandra abandoned the children.Â  We also \r\n  agree with the family court that termination of their parental rights is in \r\n  the childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  [5] \r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Michaelâ€™s mother, Sally Truitt, testified that she told the childrenâ€™s \r\n    parents she had an engagement later that night, and both said they â€œwould \r\n    be back.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Sandra testified that she was aware of the circumstances and knew \r\n    Michaelâ€™s parents were unable to care for the children for an extended period \r\n    of time.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Section 20-7-1572 was recently amended to include an additional ground \r\n    for termination; however, this amendment has no applicability in the current \r\n    case.Â  See Act No. 181, 2004 S.C. Acts 1829.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Section 20-7-1572(1) of the South Carolina Code provides that a family \r\n    court may terminate parental rights when:\r\n  \r\n  The child or another child in the home has been harmed as \r\n    defined in Section 20-7-490, and because of the severity or repetition of \r\n    the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made \r\n    safe within twelve months.Â  In determining the likelihood that the home can \r\n    be made safe, the parentâ€™s previous abuse or neglect of the child or another \r\n    child in the home may be considered[.]â€Â  \r\n  \r\n  Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  This court would also like to acknowledge and commend defense counsel \r\n    for the thorough and zealous representation of their court appointed clients.Â  \r\n    As the late Judge Bell once noted, such representation is â€œin the best tradition \r\n    of the legal profession.â€Â  Leone v.

We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 4, 1998, James and Roxana \r\n  Loftis (â€œAppellantsâ€) purchased a parcel of land located on Bryan Road in Hollywood, \r\n  South Carolina.Â  On two occasions prior to purchasing the property, Mr. Loftis \r\n  conducted a walking inspection of the land.Â  Two power lines extended across \r\n  the property, one dedicated to the previous ownerâ€™s residence and a second line \r\n  that provided electrical service to all the residents of Bryan road.Â Â Â  \r\nWhile inspecting the property at the request of \r\n  Mr. Loftis for the purpose of initiating basic electrical service, SCE&amp;G \r\n  determined that safety concerns mandated routine trimming around all the power \r\n  lines on the property.Â  Thus, on three occasions, SCE&amp;Gâ€™s independent contractors \r\n  entered the property to clear vegetation.Â  On two occasions, Appellantsâ€™ father, \r\n  who was staying on the property, halted the trimming.Â  \r\nBelieving SCE&amp;Gâ€™s trimming activities damaged \r\n  their property, Appellants brought suit, asserting claims of conversion, negligence, \r\n  and trespass.Â  Appellants asked the court for money damages, an order requiring \r\n  SCE&amp;G to remove the existing power lines, and an injunction preventing SCE&amp;G \r\n  from entering the property in the future.Â  \r\nOn October 4, 2002, SCE&amp;G filed and served \r\n  a motion for summary judgment on all causes of action.Â  On the day scheduled \r\n  for trial, the master agreed to hear arguments on SCE&amp;Gâ€™s summary judgment \r\n  motion prior to the start of trial.Â  Indicating he felt â€œhamstrung,â€ Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  trial attorney explained he was surprised a hearing was being held on the motion.Â  \r\n  The master postponed the trial, allowing Appellants â€œten days to submit a Brief \r\n  with any supporting affidavits, or evidence that you want.â€Â  After reviewing \r\n  supplemental material from both parties, the master granted summary judgment \r\n  on the trespass and conversion causes of action based on multiple grounds.Â  \r\n  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to \r\n  expedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact \r\n  finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003); \r\n  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  When \r\n  reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same \r\n  standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Fleming v. \r\n  Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is \r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Laurens Emergency Med. \r\n  Specialists v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, 108, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  375, 377 (2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the \r\n  evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. Auth., \r\n  354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., \r\n  353 S.C. 449, 455-56, 578 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2003).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants first argue the trial court \r\n  erred in hearing SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the day trial was \r\n  scheduled to begin.Â  In support of their position they cite Rule 6(d), SCRCP, \r\n  which reads, â€œa written motion . . . and notice of the hearing thereof, shall \r\n  be served not later than ten days before the time specified for the hearing.â€Â  \r\n\r\nWe conclude there was no reversible error \r\n  in the procedure followed by the trial court.Â  SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion was filed \r\n  and served twenty-seven days before the hearing.Â  In response to objections \r\n  to the timing of the motion hearing, the trial court granted Appellants ten \r\n  additional days to submit a brief and opposing affidavits and did not rule on \r\n  the motion until full consideration of these materials was given.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find Appellants have not been prejudiced.Â  See Dedes v. Strickland, \r\n  307 S.C. 152, 155, 414 S.E.2d 132, 134 (1992) (holding that failure to give \r\n  written notice of a motion hearing is reversible error when it â€œwrongfully denie[s] \r\n  the opportunity to submit affidavits, documents or testimony opposing . . . \r\n  the motionâ€ and thereby causes prejudice to the opposing party).Â  Having addressed \r\n  Appellantsâ€™ procedural exception, we move now to the merits of the masterâ€™s \r\n  findings.Â  \r\nThe master concluded, as one of several \r\n  grounds for finding a valid easement on Appellantsâ€™ property, that SCE&amp;G \r\n  successfully established an easement by prescription.Â  We affirm the masterâ€™s \r\n  decision on this ground. [1]   \r\nIn order to establish an easement by prescription \r\n  a party must show: (1) the continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of a \r\n  right for a full period of twenty years; (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed; \r\n  and (3) that the use or enjoyment was adverse or under claim of right.Â  Horry \r\n  County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 367, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993); Babb \r\n  v. Harrison, 220 S.C. 20, 24-25, 66 S.E.2d 457, 458 (1951); Hartley v. \r\n  John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island, 355 S.C. 145, 150, \r\n  584 S.E.2d 386, 388 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Having reviewed the elements which define \r\n  a prescriptive easement, we now review the evidence on the matter, being mindful \r\n  to give Appellants â€œthe benefit of all favorable inferences that might reasonably \r\n  be drawn therefrom.â€ Estes v. Roper Temporary Services, 304 S.C. 120, \r\n  121, 403 S.E.2d 157, 158 (Ct. App. 1991). \r\nWe find ample undisputed evidence in the \r\n  record to support the masterâ€™s finding of a prescriptive easement.Â  An agent \r\n  of SCE&amp;G testified that he inspected several telephone poles supporting \r\n  the electrical lines crossing Appellantsâ€™ property and found a â€œbirthmarkâ€ on \r\n  one pole reading 1972 and another reading 1954. [2] Â  The son of Appellantsâ€™ propertyâ€™s \r\n  prior owner, who is also a current neighbor of Appellants, testified that the \r\n  property in question has received electrical service through the power lines \r\n  since at least 1949.Â  A life-time neighbor and family friend to the propertyâ€™s \r\n  prior owners testified that the power lines at issue have been on the property \r\n  since the 1930â€™s, and electrical service provided every decade since.Â  Because \r\n  one of the two power lines in question is a â€œprimary distribution lineâ€ that \r\n  supplies power to the rest of Bryan Road, the few intermittent periods where \r\n  Appellantsâ€™ property did not receive electrical service do not cause the prescriptive \r\n  easement to fail for lack of â€œcontinualâ€ or â€œuninterruptedâ€ use.Â  Even when \r\n  Appellantsâ€™ property was without electrical service, the power lines were still \r\n  being maintained and used by SCE&amp;G.Â  The evidence clearly supports the masterâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that SCE&amp;G used the property to supply power to the residents \r\n  of Bryan Road for the required twenty-year period. \r\nThe brunt of Appellantsâ€™ argument, however, \r\n  lies in the third requirement for establishing an easement by prescription.Â  \r\n  Appellants incorrectly assert that a prescriptive easement cannot be established \r\n  in this case because â€œ[o]bviously, use is not adverse where the [d]efendant \r\n  had a mistaken belief it had the right to be on the property.â€Â  Appellants ignore \r\n  that a prescriptive easement can also be established under a â€œclaim of right,â€ \r\n  or, in other words, under the very mistaken belief Appellants admit drove SCE&amp;Gâ€™s \r\n  actions.Â  Our courts have held that a party may earn a prescriptive easement \r\n  under a claim of right if â€œhe demonstrate[s] a substantial belief that he had \r\n  the right to useâ€ the property in a manner consistent with the alleged easement.Â  \r\n  Hartley, 355 S.C. at 151, 584 S.E.2d at 389; see also Revis, \r\n  321 S.C. at 209, 467 S.E.2d at 462 (holding a partyâ€™s belief about her right \r\n  to use a road flowed from a claim of right); Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. \r\n  522, 528, 492 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1997) (noting a partyâ€™s belief that \r\n  he had a right-of-way may be sufficient for a prescriptive easement pursuant \r\n  to a claim of right).Â  \r\nIn the case before us, SCE&amp;G has used \r\n  and maintained the power lines in question since the 1930â€™s pursuant to their \r\n  belief they had a valid right-of-way to use the property in this manner.Â Â  Evidence \r\n  supporting this belief, or claim of right, was presented to the master in the \r\n  form of testimony regarding SCE&amp;Gâ€™s search for documents, believed to exist \r\n  but missing, proving a filed right-of-way on the property.Â  Furthermore, SCE&amp;G \r\n  presented as evidence several versions of their general service terms and conditions, \r\n  which have stated the following since 1962:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Customer, in requesting or accepting service, thereby \r\n  grants the Company without charge necessary rights-of-way and trimming and clearing \r\n  privileges for its facilities along, across, and under property controlled by \r\n  the Customer . . . to the extent that such rights-of-way and trimmings are required \r\n  or necessary to enable Company to supply service to the CustomerÂ  . . . [and] \r\n  to serve other Customers.â€\r\n\r\nSince the prior owners of Appellantsâ€™ property requested \r\n  and received decades of electrical service, this evidence clearly supports the \r\n  masterâ€™s finding that SCE&amp;G had a substantial belief it had a right to use \r\n  the property in the manner it did based upon the totality of the circumstances.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to this Courtâ€™s standard of review, we therefore uphold the masterâ€™s \r\n  establishment of an easement by prescription in favor of SCE&amp;G.\r\nFinally, we address Appellantsâ€™ contention \r\n  that since they never requested electrical service from SCE&amp;G, [3]  they are not bound by SCE&amp;Gâ€™s easement \r\n  on the property, no matter what theory supports the easementâ€™s establishment.Â  \r\n  A purchaser of land with actual, constructive, or implied notice that the property \r\n  is burdened with an easement ordinarily takes the estate subject to the easement.Â  \r\n  25 Am Jur 2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 106 at 677 (1996).Â  In order to \r\n  charge the purchaser of a servient estate with notice of an unrecorded easement, \r\n  the marks of the servitude must be open and visible.Â  25 Am Jur 2d Easements \r\n  and Licenses Â§ 107 at 678 (1996).Â  Here, the marks of the easement (the \r\n  poles and power lines) were open and visible.Â  Furthermore, Appellants admit \r\n  to making inspections of the property and to actual knowledge of the power lines \r\n  prior to the propertyâ€™s purchase.Â  We therefore conclude that Appellants purchased \r\n  the property subject to SCE&amp;Gâ€™s prescriptive easement.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the master-in-equityâ€™s \r\n  decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  In light of our disposition of the case on the issue of prescriptive \r\n    easement, it is not necessary to address Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues.Â  See \r\n    Rule 220 (c), SCACR; Futch v.

Rodman, Jr. \r\n  (â€œHusbandâ€) appeals a family court denial of his motion to vacate a previous \r\n  order, which, by the adoption of an agreement between Husband and Janet F. Rodman \r\n  (â€œWifeâ€), awarded Wife â€œreimbursement alimony.â€Â  Husband argues that, because \r\n  the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the judgment is void; therefore \r\n  the family court erred in denying the motion as time barred under Rule 60(b), \r\n  SCRCP. We disagree.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHusband and Wife participated in a marriage \r\n  ceremony on August 19, 1999.Â  Husband, however, was not legally divorced from \r\n  his prior spouse (his fifth wife) until August 31, 1999.Â  In September 2001, \r\n  Wife discovered Husband was still married to another woman on the date of their \r\n  marriage. [1] Â  Since this discovery, \r\n  the parties have lived separate and apart from one another.\r\nIn November 2001, the parties, voluntarily \r\n  and with ample opportunity to seek the advice of counsel, entered into a written \r\n  settlement agreement.Â  Although not officially represented by counsel until \r\n  later, Husband was aided during the agreement negotiations by an attorney and \r\n  family friend, who helped him draft some documents.Â  The parties agreed in writing, \r\n  inter alia, to the following:\r\n\r\n1.Â  Husband was not legally divorced from his previous wife \r\n  at the time of their marriage; thus, an annulment was appropriate. \r\n2. The written agreement constituted â€œa final permanent settlement \r\n  between them with respect to the division of all their property, both real and \r\n  personal, and with respect to any and all rights of support and all other rights \r\n  and obligations.â€Â  \r\n3. The agreement â€œis not conditioned upon the obtaining of \r\n  divorce, but instead is intended to be a complete and full settlement between \r\n  the parties independent of the obtaining of a divorce.â€Â  \r\n\r\nUnder the heading â€œALIMONY/INSURANCE,â€ \r\n  Wife agreed to accept $150,460 payable in 120 monthly increments of $2,158, \r\n  as â€œreimbursement alimonyâ€ for debt Husband allegedly accrued in her name during \r\n  their marriage.Â  These payments are addressed again in the agreement, under \r\n  the heading â€œDIVISION OF PERSONAL DEBT,â€ as follows:\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that Wife shall pay debt in her name, \r\n  however she is depending on the Spousal support payment from Husband to make \r\n  all the payments.Â  Husband must pay Wife her alimony in a timely fashion so \r\n  that she can pay the debt he incurred during the marriage.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 2002, the family court granted Wife \r\n  a decree of separate support and maintenance, \r\n  [2]  which fully incorporated the written agreement. Although properly served \r\n  with the summons, complaint, and notice of the final hearing, Husband did not \r\n  attend the hearing which led to this family court order.Â  \r\nOn March 28, 2003, more than one year following \r\n  the order, Husband filed a motion to vacate the family courtâ€™s decree of separate \r\n  support and maintenance on the ground that the marriage was void ab initio \r\n  and, as a result, any agreement entered into regarding alimony is null and void.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, the family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate \r\n  on the ground that it was filed more than one year after the date of the initial \r\n  order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court \r\n  has jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, \r\n  244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This court, however, is not required to disregard the \r\n  family courtâ€™s findings; nor should we ignore the fact that the family court \r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their testimony.Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, \r\n  838 (Ct. App. 1999); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 453, 486 S.E.2d 516, \r\n  519 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by denying \r\n  his motion as time barred under Rule 60(b), SCRCP. Husband bases this argument \r\n  on the proposition that the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to adopt the property agreement; thus, the judgment was void.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, reads:\r\n\r\nOn motion . . . the court may relieve a party . . . from \r\n  a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:Â  (1) mistake, \r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence \r\n  . . . ; (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct . . . ; (4) the judgment \r\n  is void;Â  (5) the judgment has been satisfied . . . . \r\n\r\nThe rule continues, â€œ[t]he motion shall be made within a \r\n  reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after \r\n  the judgment or proceeding was entered or taken.â€Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\nIt is undisputed that Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate \r\n  was filed more than one year following the entry of the family courtâ€™s order; \r\n  thus, to be considered timely under the rule, the motion must be based on either \r\n  subsection (4) or (5).Â  Because Husband makes no claim that the judgment has \r\n  been satisfied, the sole issue before this court is whether the family court \r\n  order is â€œvoidâ€ under the rule. See Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.\r\nThe definition of â€œvoidâ€ under Rule 60(b) â€œonly \r\n  encompasses judgments from courts which failed to provide proper due process, \r\n  or judgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or personal \r\n  jurisdiction.â€Â  McDaniel v. U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, \r\n  478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Husband argues the family court erred \r\n  in applying the one-year deadline to his motion because the family court lacks \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to adopt a property agreement incident a marriage \r\n  that was void ab initio. \r\n  [3] Â  He contends that, because of this alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n  the family court order is void, thus the family court should have applied the \r\n  â€œreasonable timeâ€ standard of Rule 60(b)(4), and not the one-year limit of subsection \r\n  (1), (2), and (3).Â  \r\nBecause the property agreement was adopted by \r\n  the family court in response to Wifeâ€™s petition for annulment and decree of \r\n  separate support and maintenance, we find Husbandâ€™s argument to be without merit.Â  \r\n  It has long been established that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(6) (1976 &amp; Supp. \r\n  2003) grants the family court exclusive jurisdiction over annulment proceedings.Â  \r\n  White v. White, 283 S.C. 348, 349, 323 S.E.2d 521, 522 (1984).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  this jurisdiction extends, not just to the issue of the actual annulment, but \r\n  to â€œall matters in an annulment action, as in a divorce proceeding,â€ including \r\n  the equitable distribution of property.Â  Id., 283 S.C. at 350, 323 S.E.2d \r\n  at 522; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(30) (1976 &amp; Supp. \r\n  2003) (granting the family court exclusive jurisdiction â€œto hear and determine \r\n  any questions of support, custody, separation, or any other matter over which \r\n  the court has jurisdiction.â€).\r\nThere is no legal distinction between a marriage \r\n  which is annulled and one terminated by reason of bigamy, as they are both void \r\n  ab intio, or â€œfrom the inception.â€Â  Splawn v. Splawn, 311 \r\n  S.C. 423, 425, 429 S.E.2d 805, 806 (1993).Â  In fact, the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court has specifically held the family court has subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to equitably distribute property in a bigamous marriage.Â  Id., 311 S.C. \r\n  at 424, 429 S.E.2d at 806.Â  Following the analysis of White and Splawn, \r\n  we find the family court had subject matter jurisdiction to adopt the agreement \r\n  of the parties.Â  Because the family court had subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n  decide the matter, Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate the order was untimely under Rule \r\n  60(b), SCRCP.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate was \r\n  untimely, the family court properly denied the motion.Â  The decision of the \r\n  family court is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Husband claims he told Wife about this inadvertent mistake immediately \r\n    upon realizing it himself.Â  Wife claims she discovered a record of the final \r\n    divorce date in a stack of Husbandâ€™s papers and Husband became verbally and \r\n    physically abusive when confronted with the evidence. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  \r\n   In what appears to be nothing more than a simple mistake, the decree of \r\n    separate support and maintenance is referenced once in the order as a â€œfinal \r\n    order of divorce.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Husband makes no allegation that the family court lacked personal \r\n    jurisdiction or failed to provide proper due process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3876","title":"Hamilton v.

Murry Kinard, both of Lexington, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Melissa D. Hamilton brought \r\n  this action against R&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;L Transfer, Inc., alleging the negligence \r\n  of an R &amp; L Transfer employee caused a collision resulting in her injuries.Â  \r\n  The trial judge directed a verdict for Hamilton on liability, and the jury awarded \r\n  damages to her.Â  R &amp; L appeals.&nbsp; We affirm in part, reverse in part, and \r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action arises out of an automobile \r\n  accident that occurred in Lexington County on the morning of February 24, 1999. \r\n  Â Hamilton was driving to work on Interstate 20, traveling towards Columbia.Â  \r\n  It was snowing and the snow was beginning to accumulate on the road.Â  Hamilton \r\n  crossed over an icy bridge, causing her to lose control of her vehicle and slide \r\n  into the median.Â  After her car stopped in the median, Hamilton got out of her \r\n  car and walked over to another disabled motorist in the median who had also \r\n  lost control of his vehicle.Â  As Hamilton walked over to the other vehicle in \r\n  the median, a car driven by Kim Wright also lost control while crossing the \r\n  icy bridge.Â  Wrightâ€™s vehicle made a 360-degree spin in the left-hand lane but \r\n  remained on the highway.Â  \r\nDaniel G. Bishop, an employee with R &amp; L Transfer, \r\n  was driving an eighteen-wheeler and traveling behind Wright.Â  Bishop crossed \r\n  over the ice-covered bridge without losing control.Â  However, as he crossed \r\n  over the bridge, Bishop saw Wright lose control of her vehicle.Â  Bishop testified \r\n  he had approximately one second to react when he first noticed Wrightâ€™s car \r\n  out of control.Â  Attempting to avoid a collision with Wrightâ€™s vehicle, Bishop \r\n  slowed and hugged the yellow line closest to the median.Â  However, Bishop and \r\n  Wright collided, forcing Bishop to veer the eighteen-wheeler into the median \r\n  where Hamilton stood outside her stranded vehicle.Â  Although Bishop was not \r\n  aware of a collision between his truck and Hamiltonâ€™s vehicle, his truck hit \r\n  Hamiltonâ€™s car, causing her car to leave the ground and land on her left leg, \r\n  pinning her underneath the car for several minutes.Â  Hamilton did not suffer \r\n  any broken bones, but did sustain muscle injury and missed a week and a half \r\n  of work.Â  \r\nHamilton brought this action against R &amp; L \r\n  Transfer alleging Bishop negligently collided with her car.Â  R &amp; L Transfer \r\n  answered and filed a third-party complaint for equitable indemnification and \r\n  negligence against Wright.Â  The circuit court granted Wrightâ€™s motion to dismiss \r\n  the third-party complaint.Â  R &amp; L Transfer made a motion for summary judgment \r\n  which was denied.Â  At the conclusion of Hamiltonâ€™s case, R &amp; L Transfer \r\n  sought a directed verdict, which was denied.Â  At the close of R &amp; L Transferâ€™s \r\n  case, Hamilton moved for a directed verdict on the issue of liability.Â  The \r\n  trial judge granted the motion and submitted the issue of damages to the jury.Â  \r\n  The jury awarded Hamilton $30,000 in actual damages and $20,000 in punitive \r\n  damages.Â  Hamilton was also awarded court costs.Â  \r\nR &amp; L Transfer filed motions for judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict, a new trial based on the thirteenth juror doctrine, new trial absolute, \r\n  new trial nisi remittitur, and new trial based on prejudicial remarks by the \r\n  trial court.Â  The trial court denied each motion.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nR &amp; L Transfer argues the trial court erred \r\n  in granting a directed verdict in Hamiltonâ€™s favor on the issue of liability.Â  \r\n  We agree. \r\nWe find the trial court erred in granting Hamiltonâ€™s \r\n  motion for a directed verdict because the issue of R &amp; L Transferâ€™s negligence \r\n  was an issue for the jury.Â  When ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the \r\n  court is required to view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the \r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing \r\n  of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 611, 518 S.E.2d 591, 597 (1999).Â  â€œIf \r\n  more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the case \r\n  must be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Mullinax v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., \r\n  333 S.C. 89, 92, 508 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1998).Â  \r\nIn order to prove R &amp; L Transferâ€™s negligence, \r\n  it was essential for Hamilton to establish the following: (1) a duty of care \r\n  owed by R &amp; L Transfer to Hamilton, (2) breach of that duty, and (3) damages \r\n  to Hamilton proximately resulting from the breach.Â  Thomasko v. Poole, \r\n  349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002).Â  A partyâ€™s negligence is the proximate \r\n  cause only when, without the negligence, the injury could have been avoided \r\n  or would not have happened.Â  Alston v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co., 308 S.C. \r\n  292, 296, 417 S.E.2d 631, 633 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œIt is generally for the jury \r\n  to determine whether the defendantâ€™s negligence was a concurring proximate cause \r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s injuries.Â  Only when the evidence is susceptible of only \r\n  one inference does proximate cause become a matter of law for the court.â€Â  Bishop \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 89, 502 S.E.2d 78, \r\n  83 (1998) (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nAlthough the evidence here indicates Bishopâ€™s vehicle \r\n  hit Hamiltonâ€™s, the evidence does not establish he breached his duty of due \r\n  care to Hamilton.Â  Because Hamilton was conversing with the other stranded motorist \r\n  in the median at the time Bishop crossed the bridge, Hamilton was unable to \r\n  offer any testimony regarding Bishopâ€™s speed or other characteristics of his \r\n  driving at the time of the accident.Â  Similarly, although Wright testified she \r\n  observed Bishop traveling at a higher rate of speed than the other vehicles \r\n  on the road, she further explained she only witnessed his driving before he \r\n  reached the overpass.Â  She did not see the R &amp; L Transfer truck immediately \r\n  before the accident or as it occurred.Â  This evidence does not establish Bishop \r\n  was driving negligently at the time of the accident.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the evidence does not produce only the \r\n  inference Bishopâ€™s negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of Hamiltonâ€™s \r\n  damages.Â  Bishop testified he only had a second to react to the blocked roadway.Â  \r\n  A neutral witness testified similarly. Â A jury could conclude either \r\n  the icy conditions or the sudden emergency of disabled and out-of-control vehicles \r\n  Bishop faced as he traversed the bridge caused the accident rather than negligent \r\n  driving by Bishop.Â  See Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 391-92, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 528, 540 (2000) (discussing the sudden emergency doctrine); Elrod \r\n  v. All, 243 S.C. 425, 438, 134 S.E.2d 410, 417 (1964) (noting the question \r\n  of sudden emergency is ordinarily for the jury).Â  Because the evidence here \r\n  is susceptible to more than one inference, the grant of Hamiltonâ€™s directed \r\n  verdict motion was error.Â  However, because we find R&nbsp;&amp; L Transferâ€™s \r\n  liability was a jury issue, we affirm the denial of its directed verdict motion.Â  \r\n  As a result of our reversal of Hamiltonâ€™s directed verdict, we further reverse \r\n  the award of court costs to Hamilton.\r\nHaving determined this\r\ncase should be remanded for a new trial, we do not address the remaining issues\r\non appeal. See Futch, 335 S.C. at 613, 518 S.E.2d at 598 (ruling appellate court need\r\nnot review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3877","title":"B&amp;A Development v.

Connell, Jr., of Surfside \r\n  Beach, for Appellants\r\nDavid J. Mills and Thomas J. \r\n  Rubillo, both of Georgetown and David T. Duff, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.: Â In this case, a group of \r\n  Georgetown County taxpayers brought action in circuit court alleging the County \r\n  had imposed excessive, unlawful taxes on their real and personal property.Â  \r\n  These taxpayers sought relief in the form of a refund or tax credit.Â  The circuit \r\n  court dismissed the taxpayersâ€™ case on the grounds they had failed to exhaust \r\n  the administrative remedies prescribed under the South Carolina Revenue Procedures \r\n  Act (RPA or â€œthe Actâ€) (S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-60-10 to -3390 (2000 &amp; Supp. \r\n  2003)).Â  The taxpayers now appeal, arguing the RPA does not apply to their claims.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe taxpayers who brought this case are twelve \r\n  corporate and individual Georgetown County residents (hereinafter the â€œTaxpayersâ€).Â  \r\n  Styling the suit a class action on behalf of themselves and others similarly \r\n  situated, Taxpayers brought this suit against several governing bodies and officers \r\n  of the Countyâ€”naming as defendants Georgetown County, members of the County \r\n  Council, the County Auditor, the County Treasurer, as well as the Georgetown \r\n  County School District.Â  In their complaint, Taxpayers claimed the County had \r\n  imposed an illegal levy of millage rates, resulting in unlawfully excessive \r\n  taxation of their real and personal property.Â  The specific allegations center \r\n  around the assessment of public money to fund the School District. \r\nIn Georgetown County, the amount \r\n  of the annual property tax assessment depends to a large degree on the amount \r\n  of money the School District determines it needs for operations in the coming \r\n  the year.Â  The process is straightforward: After the School District prepares \r\n  its budget, the County auditor sets the tax rate, expressed in mills, to provide \r\n  the necessary revenue to fund School District operations.Â  \r\nTaxpayers contend the County has levied upon property owners \r\n  a higher millage rate than was needed to supply the revenue requested by the \r\n  School District.Â  Taxpayers allege this excess tax has created an illegal surplus \r\n  each year from approximately 1991 until the time this lawsuit was filed in 2001.Â  \r\n  They claim the cumulative amount of the surplus collections exceeds $28 million. \r\n\r\nTaxpayers brought their suit for the wrongful collection \r\n  of taxes in the circuit court. The circuit court granted motions to dismiss \r\n  filed by the County and School District, concluding the RPA requires Taxpayers \r\n  to exhaust their administrative remedies under the Act.Â  Therefore, as prescribed \r\n  by the RPA, the circuit court dismissed the case without prejudice. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-3390 (Supp. 2003).Â  A subsequent motion to reconsider \r\n  filed by the Taxpayers was denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Applicability \r\n  of the RPA\r\nTaxpayers first argue the RPA does not apply to \r\n  their cause of action for illegal taxation against the County.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe RPA prescribes the procedures for resolving \r\n  claims for the wrongful collection of taxes in our state. [1] Â  The language of its operative provisions signals the Actâ€™s \r\n  broad and comprehensive application.Â  Specifically, section 12-60-80 of the \r\n  RPA provides â€œthere is no remedy other than those provided in this chapter in \r\n  any case involving the illegal or wrongful collection of taxes, \r\n  or attempt to collect taxes.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-80(A) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis \r\n  added). [2] Â  The only exception to this mandate is for â€œaction[s] for a \r\n  declaratory judgment where the sole issue is whether a statute is constitutional.â€ \r\n  Â§ 12-60-80(B) ; see also Evans v. State, 344 S.C. 60, 66, \r\n  543 S.E.2d 547, 550 (2001) (â€œRecognizing the separation of powers doctrine prohibits \r\n  an agency and ALJ from ruling on the constitutionality of a statute, [the court] \r\n  concluded Â§ 12-60-3390 was inapplicable â€˜where the sole issue [was] whether \r\n  a statute or other legislative action is constitutional.â€™â€ (quoting Ward \r\n  v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 20, 538 S.E.2d 245, 248 (2000)). [3] Â  \r\nTaxpayers, however, contend their cause of action \r\n  for illegal taxation arises under a statute that is not subject to the administrative \r\n  and adjudicatory processes prescribed under the RPA.Â  They claim their substantive \r\n  right and remedy arise exclusively under South Carolina Code section 12-43-285.Â  \r\n  This statute was enacted as part of the South Carolina County Equalization and \r\n  Reassessment Act (S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-43-210 to -360 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2003)), \r\n  a law designed to ensure all property is taxed uniformly and equitably by assessing \r\n  officials in the state. See Â§ 12-43-210.Â  Under the heading â€œCertification \r\n  of millage rates; excessive rates,â€ section 12-43-285 provides, in pertinent \r\n  part: \r\n\r\nIf a millage rate is in excess \r\n  of that authorized by law, the county treasurer shall either issue refunds or \r\n  transfer the total amount in excess of that authorized by law, upon collection, \r\n  to a separate, segregated fund, which must be credited to taxpayers in the following \r\n  year as instructed by the governing body of the political subdivision on whose \r\n  behalf the millage was levied.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-43-285(B) (Supp. 2003).\r\nTaxpayers argue section 12-43-285 entitles them to bring \r\n  action directly in circuit court. We disagree.Â  This statute was enacted by \r\n  the Legislature in 2001â€”six years after the enactment of the RPA. See \r\n  Act No. 89, 2001 S.C. Acts 2070 (enactment of Â§ 12-43-285); Act No. 60, 1995 \r\n  S.C. Acts 362 (enactment of RPA).Â  It is a well-established principle of statutory \r\n  interpretation that subsequent legislation should be construed in harmony with \r\n  existing laws. See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 88, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  578, 583 (2000) (holding that â€œ[s]tatutes dealing with the same subject matter \r\n  must be reconciled, if possible, so as to render both operativeâ€); Justice \r\n  v. Pantry, 330 S.C. 37, 43-44, 496 S.E.2d 871, 874 (Ct. App. 1998) (opining \r\n  that â€œ[i]t is presumed that the Legislature [is] familiar with prior legislation \r\n  . . . hence, if by any fair or liberal construction two acts may be made to \r\n  harmonize, no [c]ourt is justified in deciding that the last repealed the firstâ€) \r\n  (quoting State v. Hood, 181 S.C. 488, 491, 188 S.E. 134, 136 (1936)). \r\n  Neither section 12-43-285 nor any other provision of the County Equalization \r\n  and Reassessment Act indicates a legislative intent to override or supplant \r\n  the exclusive remedy provisions of the RPA.Â  \r\nIndeed, section 12-43-285 is silent regarding the forum \r\n  in which an action may be pursued under its provisions.Â  The RPA, on the other \r\n  hand, provides explicit remedial procedures for taxpayers pursuing claims for \r\n  allegedly wrongful real and personal property taxes assessed by county governments.Â  \r\n  The Act provides that a taxpayer may contest real property taxes assessed by \r\n  the county assessor by filing a claim for refund with the assessor and provides \r\n  a right of appeal to the Administrative Law Judge Division. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  12-60-2560 (2000).Â  The same basic procedures for taxpayers contesting a countyâ€™s \r\n  personal property tax assessment are also provided for under the RPA. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-2940 (2000).\r\nOur supreme court further clarified the scope of the administrative \r\n  remedies available to taxpayers under the RPA in Brackenbrook North Charleston, \r\n  LP v. County of Charleston, __ S.C. __, 602 S.E.2d 39 (2004).Â  In that case, \r\n  the plaintiff taxpayers brought an action in circuit court alleging Charleston \r\n  County levied an excessive millage rate on real property.Â  The circuit court \r\n  allowed the taxpayersâ€™ judicial action, finding the taxpayers had no administrative \r\n  remedies under the RPA because the Act did not cover taxpayer challenges to \r\n  the countyâ€™s millage rate determination.Â  The circuit court concluded the RPAâ€™s \r\n  mandated administrative remedies only applied to taxpayer challenges to a countyâ€™s \r\n  â€œproperty tax assessmentâ€ (PTA). [4] Â Â  Because the taxpayers in Brackenbrook \r\n  did not dispute any component of their PTA, the circuit court held the taxpayers \r\n  had an immediate right of judicial action.Â  The supreme court reversed, holding \r\n  that: \r\n\r\nWhile the Act contains many specific \r\n  procedures for taxpayers challenging their PTAs, reliefÂ  under the Act is not \r\n  limited to these types of protests. Section 12-60-2530(A) specifically provides \r\n  the board of assessment appeals may rule on any PTA dispute â€œand also other \r\n  relevant claims of a legal or factual nature except claims relating to property \r\n  tax exemptions.â€Â  \r\n. . . .\r\nLooking first to the Act, as \r\n  we must, we hold that Taxpayersâ€™ remedy is not this direct circuit court refund \r\n  suit, but rather an administrative refund pursuant to Â§ 12-60-2560.\r\n\r\nId. at 44 (footnote omitted).Â  As interpreted by \r\n  our supreme court, therefore, the RPAâ€™s administrative procedures and remedies \r\n  are not limited to a narrow class of taxpayer suits.Â  Rather, the Actâ€™s provisions \r\n  are sufficiently expansive to include any â€œrelevant claims of a legal or factual \r\n  nature.â€Â  The RPA therefore vests county administrative bodies with jurisdiction \r\n  to hear and decide in the first instance a broad range of taxpayer suits. \r\nAccordingly, section 12-43-285 does not supplant the remedial \r\n  scheme of the RPA.Â  Had the Legislature intended to allow for direct action \r\n  in circuit courtâ€”in contravention of the broadly defined scope of the RPAâ€”it \r\n  could have expressly provided for such immediate judicial review.\r\nII.Â  Constitutionality \r\n  of the RPAâ€™s Remedies\r\nTaxpayers alternatively claim they should be excused \r\n  from the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies under the RPA because \r\n  the Act as applied does not provide them a constitutionally adequate remedy \r\n  under the facts of this case.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic \r\n  Beverages and Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18 (1990), the United States Supreme Court \r\n  held due process requires that all taxpayers must have a â€œclear and certainâ€ \r\n  remedy for taxes collected in violation of law. Id. at 39.Â  The Supreme \r\n  Court has noted, however, that McKesson affords great flexibility to \r\n  the states in satisfying these due process requirements, allowing states to \r\n  â€œdetermine whether to provide a predeprivation process (e.g., an injunction) \r\n  or instead to afford postdeprivation relief (e.g., a refund).â€ National \r\n  Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Commâ€™n, 515 U.S. 582, 587 (1995); \r\n  see also Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 110-11 (1994) \r\n  (holding that â€œ[d]ue process . . . allows the State to maintain an exclusively \r\n  postdeprivation regime . . . or a hybrid regime. A State is free as well to \r\n  reconfigure its remedial scheme over time, to fit its changing needs. Such choices \r\n  are generally a matter only of state law.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nAs discussed above, sections 12-60-2560 (real \r\n  property) and 12-60-2940 (personal property) of the RPA provide Taxpayers with \r\n  a comprehensive postdeprivation procedure (claim for refund) to contest the \r\n  taxes assessed by the County.Â  Taxpayers offer no valid reason why they could \r\n  not initiate a claim for a refund of the taxes paid by following the procedures \r\n  prescribed under these statutes.\r\nTaxpayers argue the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  a constitutionally sufficient â€œclear and certainâ€ remedy is available under \r\n  the RPA.Â  This contention is premised on Taxpayersâ€™ claim that they could not \r\n  bring an action against the School District under the Act in the Administrative \r\n  Law Judge (ALJ) Division.Â  After the circuit court dismissed this suit without \r\n  prejudice in January 2003, Taxpayers brought their action before the ALJ Division \r\n  and did not name the School District as a party.Â  Taxpayers then filed a motion \r\n  to reconsider with the circuit court, claiming they had been â€œadvisedâ€ that \r\n  the School District could not be made a party â€œunder the current statutory scheme \r\n  for refunds of property taxes.â€Â  Therefore, Taxpayers argue, the RPA fails to \r\n  provide them a clear and certain remedy because they are prevented from pursuing \r\n  their claims against the School Districtâ€”the party they allege â€œhas all of the \r\n  taxes which [Taxpayers] assert are illegal.â€ \r\nWe reject this argument as meritless.Â  As revealed in the \r\n  transcript of the circuit court hearing on the motion to reconsider, Taxpayers \r\n  apparently received this â€œadviceâ€ from an unidentified employee in the office \r\n  of the clerk of court in the ALJ Division.Â  It hardly bears noting that the \r\n  purported opinion of the ALJ clerkâ€™s office does not determine who may or may \r\n  not be sued in our stateâ€™s adjudicatory forums.Â  Determining proper parties \r\n  is a judicial function, not a clerkâ€™s function.Â  There is nothing in the statutes \r\n  that precluded Taxpayers from naming the School District or any other governmental \r\n  subdivision with taxing authority.Â  Taxpayersâ€™ purposeful decision not to include \r\n  the School District in their complaint before the ALJ Division is a transparent \r\n  attempt to create the illusion that the RPA and ALJ procedures do not provide \r\n  a clear and certain remedy.Â  Moreover, the record before us shows that the School \r\n  District has successfully intervened and joined the ALJ action as a necessary \r\n  party and that the School District is bound by that litigation. \r\nWe conclude the RPA provides a clear and certain \r\n  remedy in the form of a post-deprivation process for Taxpayers to bring their \r\n  action against the County and School District, therefore passing constitutional \r\n  muster under McKesson and National Private Truck Council.\r\nIII.Â  Novel Issue \r\n  Rule\r\nTaxpayers also argue the circuit court erred by \r\n  deciding a novel issue on a Rule 12(b), SCRCP, motion to dismiss.Â  They contend \r\n  the nature of the issues presented in this case warranted further factual development \r\n  before a dispositive ruling.Â  We disagree. \r\nAs a general rule, our courts are reluctant to \r\n  decide important questions of novel impression on a motion to dismiss before \r\n  the parties have had an opportunity to fully develop the factual record. Evans \r\n  v. State, 344 S.C. 60, 68, 543 S.E.2d 547, 551 (2001).Â  Instead, â€œ[a] novel \r\n  issue . . . is best decided in light of the testimony to be adduced at trial.â€ \r\n  Tyler v. Macks Stores of South Carolina, Inc., 275 S.C. 456, 459, 272 \r\n  S.E.2d 633, 634 (1980).Â  â€œHowever, where the dispute is not as to the underlying \r\n  facts but as to interpretation of the law, and development ofÂ  the record will \r\n  not aid in the resolution of the issues, it is proper to decide even novel issues \r\n  on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.â€ Evans, 344 S.C. \r\n  at 68, 543 S.E.2d at 551. \r\nThe overarching issue in this case is whether \r\n  the exclusive remedy provisions of the RPA govern the dispute resolution process \r\n  in adjudicating Taxpayersâ€™ claims.Â  This issue is purely a question of law.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find further development of the factual record would not aid in \r\n  determining the statutory and constitutional questions raised.Â  The circuit \r\n  court therefore acted appropriately in deciding this issue on a motion to dismiss.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Taxpayers must exhaust their administrative \r\n  remedies provided under the RPA before their suit for illegal taxation can receive \r\n  judicial review.Â  Taxpayersâ€™ arguments that the RPA does not apply to their \r\n  action and that the RPA is unconstitutional as applied in this case are unpersuasive.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, we find the circuit court disposition of this matter on a motion \r\n  to dismiss was proper.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court dismissing \r\n  Taxpayersâ€™ case without prejudice is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n HEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [1] In 1995, the Legislature adopted the RPA with the express legislative \r\n    intent â€œto provide the people of this State with a straightforward procedure \r\n    to determine any disputed revenue liability.â€ \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-20 (2000) (emphasis added).Â  In 2000, the Legislature \r\n    substituted the phrase â€œdispute with the Department of Revenueâ€ for â€œany disputed \r\n    revenue liabilityâ€ in Â§ 12-60-20. See Â§ 12-60-20 (Supp. 2003).Â  Our \r\n    supreme court has noted that this alteration did not affect the applicability \r\n    of the RPA to county tax protest procedures: \r\n  \r\n  Although \r\n    this amendment could be read as indicative of an intent to limit the Act to \r\n    tax issues involving the DOR, when amending Â§ 12-60-20 the legislature did \r\n    not amend or repeal those parts of the Act which deal solely with county tax \r\n    disputes. In light of this, we hold that a court must look first to the Act \r\n    when faced with a question of county tax protest procedures. \r\n  \r\n  Brackenbrook \r\n    North Charleston, LP v. County of Charleston, __ S.C. __, 602 S.E.2d 39, \r\n    42 (2004).\r\n\r\n \r\n  [2] We also note that recent amendments to Â§ 12-60-80 provide that â€œa claim \r\n    or action for the refund of taxes may not be brought as a class action in \r\n    the Administrative Law Judge Division or any court of law in this State . \r\n    . . .â€ Â§ 12-60-80(C) (Act No. 69, 2003 S.C. Acts 744). \r\n\r\n \r\n  [3] Taxpayers do not challenge the facial constitutionality of the RPA.Â  Consequently, \r\n    the declaratory judgment exception pursuant to Evans v. State \r\n    does not apply, and Taxpayers so concede, for they only dispute the constitutionality \r\n    of the RPA as applied to them. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] The PTA for each parcel of taxable real estate in a county is determined \r\n    by multiplying the propertyâ€™s fair market value or special use value by the \r\n    appropriate assessment ratio. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-30(19) (Supp. 2003). \r\n    This PTA figure is then multiplied by the taxing districtâ€™s millage rate, \r\n    resulting in the tax assessment, that is, the dollar amount owed by the taxpayer \r\n    for that year.

(collectively, \r\n  Respondents) were two of the defendants in the action.Â  Respondents were dismissed \r\n  from the action after filing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  \r\n  After the denial of Appellantsâ€™ motion for reconsideration, this appeal follows.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJames Doe, while under the care of Dr. \r\n  Robert Marion, was allegedly â€œrepeatedly sexually molested by Defendant Marion \r\n  for a period of several years.â€Â  James Doe allegedly suffered â€œpermanent physical \r\n  pain and suffering and extreme emotional distress.â€Â  John Doe, James Doeâ€™s father, \r\n  asserted he lost the companionship of his child, suffered extreme emotional \r\n  distress, and has lost earnings as a result of his sonâ€™s molestation.\r\nAppellants filed an Amended Complaint, \r\n  which alleged the following facts that are deemed true and admitted for purposes \r\n  of this appeal. [1] Â  Dr. Carol \r\n  Graf is a psychiatrist who began treating a victim of Dr. Marionâ€™s molestation.Â  \r\n  The victim told Dr. Graf of the molestation beginning in at least 1984.Â  Dr. \r\n  Graf never notified law enforcement or social services authorities of the child \r\n  abuse.Â  Dr. Graf failed to notify the medical licensing board or ethics review \r\n  panel.Â  The Amended Complaint alleges that under S.C. Code Ann. section 20-7-510 \r\n  (Supp. 2002), Dr. Graf had a duty to report the suspected child abuse and sexual \r\n  abuse to the appropriate authorities.Â  The complaint contends the failure to \r\n  notify was negligence per se and â€œenabled Defendant Marion to continue contact \r\n  with and molestation of his then current and future minor patients.â€\r\nDr. Graf attempted to treat Dr. Marion \r\n  â€œfor his predilection for child molestation simultaneously with her treatment \r\n  of other existing victim(s).â€Â  The Amended Complaint alleges Dr. Graf \r\n  â€œfailed to warn the foreseeable victims of Defendant Marion of the danger that \r\n  he posed.â€Â  It contends Dr. Graf â€œbreached her common law duty to warn Plaintiff \r\n  James Doe.â€Â  The complaint asserts Carol Graf, M.D. &amp; Associates, P.A. is \r\n  vicariously liable as a result of Dr. Grafâ€™s negligence. \r\nRespondents filed a motion to dismiss \r\n  for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The trial \r\n  court granted the motion.Â  In its order, the trial court found: (1) no common \r\n  law duty to warn existed because there was no specific threat to a specific \r\n  individual; (2) even assuming section 20-7-510 created a private cause of action, \r\n  it is only for failure to notify regarding threats to a specific child, not \r\n  any possible future victims; and (3) section 20-7-510 does not create a private \r\n  cause of action for failing to notify the appropriate authorities.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion for reconsideration.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move \r\n  to dismiss based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \r\n  of action.Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 201, 584 S.E.2d 413, \r\n  415 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (citing Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999)).Â  A trial judge in the civil setting may \r\n  dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed to \r\n  state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in the pleadings filed \r\n  with the court.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d \r\n  496 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Generally, in considering a 12(b)(6) motion, the trial \r\n  court must base its ruling solely upon allegations set forth on the face of \r\n  the complaint. Â Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 \r\n  (1995); see also Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 353 S.E.2d \r\n  697 (1987) (noting trial court must dispose of motion for failure to state cause \r\n  of action based solely upon allegations set forth on face of complaint); Williams, \r\n  347 S.C. at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 499 (finding that trial courtâ€™s ruling on 12(b)(6) \r\n  motion must be bottomed and premised solely upon allegations set forth by plaintiff).\r\nâ€œA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should \r\n  not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom \r\n  would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.â€Â  Flateau, \r\n  355 S.C. at 202, 584 S.E.2d at 415; see Gentry v. Yonce, \r\n  337 S.C. 1, 522 S.E.2d 137 (1999); see also Baird, 333 \r\n  S.C. at 527, 511 S.E.2d at 73 (declaring that if the facts and inferences drawn \r\n  from the facts alleged on the complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief \r\n  on any theory, then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a \r\n  claim is improper); McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  431 (Ct. App. 1997) (concluding that motion to dismiss cannot be sustained if \r\n  facts alleged in complaint and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would \r\n  entitle plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case).Â  In deciding whether \r\n  the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, this Court must consider \r\n  whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \r\n  states any valid claim for relief.Â  See Gentry, \r\n  337 S.C. at 5, 522 S.E.2d at 139; see also Cowart v. Poore, \r\n  337 S.C. 359, 523 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1999) (explaining that looking at facts \r\n  in light most favorable to plaintiff, and with all doubts resolved in his behalf, \r\n  the court must consider whether the pleadings articulate any valid claim for \r\n  relief).\r\nThe complaint should not be dismissed merely because \r\n  the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  Toussaint v. \r\n  Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987).Â  The trial courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of a motion to dismiss will be sustained if the facts alleged in the complaint \r\n  do not support relief under any theory of law.Â  Tatum v. Medical Univ. of \r\n  South Carolina, 346 S.C. 194, 552 S.E.2d 18 (2001); see also \r\n  Gray v. State Farm Auto Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 646, 491 S.E.2d 272 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997) (stating motion must be granted if facts and inferences reasonably \r\n  deducible from them show that plaintiff could not prevail on any theory of the \r\n  case).\r\nâ€œDismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n  is appealable.â€Â  Williams, 347 at 233, 553 S.E.2d at 500.Â  Upon \r\n  review of a dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the appellate \r\n  court applies the same standard of review implemented by the trial court.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend the trial court erred \r\n  in dismissing the claims for negligence against Dr. Graf.Â  They assert the complaint \r\n  properly alleges causes of action for common law negligence and negligence per \r\n  se for violation of S.C Code Ann. section 20-7-510 (Supp. 2002).Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to prove negligence, the plaintiff \r\n  must show: (1) defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant \r\n  breached the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) defendantâ€™s breach was \r\n  the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) plaintiff \r\n  suffered an injury or damages.Â  Andrade v. Johnson, 356 S.C. 238, 245, \r\n  588 S.E.2d 588, 592 (2003); Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 668, \r\n  582 S.E.2d 432, 443 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  To sustain an action for negligence, it \r\n  is essential the plaintiff demonstrate the defendant breached a duty of care \r\n  owed to the plaintiff.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. \r\n  416, 429, 567 S.E.2d 231, 237 (2002); Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental \r\n  Health, 331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998).Â  The existence of a duty owed \r\n  is a question of law for the courts.Â  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 323, \r\n  548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001).Â  In a negligence action, if no duty exists, the \r\n  defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Simmons v. Tuomey \r\n  Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 39, 533 S.E.2d 312, 316 (2000).\r\nUnder South Carolina law, there is no \r\n  general duty to control the conduct of another or to warn a third person or \r\n  potential victim of danger.Â Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, \r\n  350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 546 (2002); Rogers v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Parole &amp; Cmty Corr., 320 S.C. 253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995); Rayfield \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. \r\n  1988); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 314 (1965).Â  The Faile court inculcated:\r\n\r\nWe recognize five exceptions to this rule: 1) where the defendant \r\n  has a special relationship to the victim; 2) where the defendant has a special \r\n  relationship to the injurer; 3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a \r\n  duty; 4) where the defendant negligently or intentionally creates the risk; \r\n  and 5) where a statute imposes a duty on the defendant.Â  See generally, \r\n  Hubbard &amp; Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 57-72 (1990).\r\n\r\nFaile, 350 S.C. at 334, 566 S.E.2d at 546 \r\n  (footnotes omitted).\r\nI.Â  Common Law Negligence\r\nAppellants argue a duty to warn all future \r\n  foreseeable victims arose out of the â€œspecial relationshipâ€ created in the psychiatristâ€“patient \r\n  relationship.Â  We find that no duty to warn was created.\r\nSouth Carolina law does not recognize a general \r\n  duty to warn of the dangerous propensities of others.Â  Bishop v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998).Â  â€œHowever, \r\n  when a defendant has the ability to monitor, supervise, and control an individualâ€™s \r\n  conduct, a special relationship exists between the defendant and the individual, \r\n  and the defendant may have a common law duty to warn potential victims of the \r\n  individualâ€™s dangerous conduct.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThis duty to warn arises when \r\n  the individual has made a specific threat of harm directed at a specific \r\n  individual.â€Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court relied upon Tarasoff \r\n  v. Regents of Univ. of California, 551 P.2d 334 (1976), in reaching its \r\n  conclusions in Bishop.Â  Specifically, the court quoted the following \r\n  language explicating the duty:\r\n\r\nWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards \r\n  of his profession should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger \r\n  of violence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect \r\n  the intended victim against such danger.Â  The discharge of this duty may require \r\n  the therapist to take one or more of various steps, depending upon the nature \r\n  of the case.Â  Thus it may call for him to warn the intended victim or others \r\n  likely to apprise the victim of the danger, to notify the police, or to take \r\n  whatever other steps are reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nTarasoff, 551 P.2d at 340.Â  Citing several \r\n  cases relying on Tarasoff, the court in Bishop enounced: â€œthis \r\n  duty [to warn] is only owed when a patient specifically threatens a readily \r\n  identifiable third partyâ€ and reiterated that the duty requires â€œthe defendant \r\n  be aware or should have been aware of the specific threat made by the patient \r\n  to harm a specific person.â€Â  Bishop, 331 S.C. at 87-88, 502 S.E.2d at \r\n  82.Â Â  \r\nNowhere in the complaint have Appellants \r\n  alleged a specific threat made by Dr. Marion directed against James Doe.Â  The \r\n  Amended Complaint alleges a duty to warn â€œforeseeable victimsâ€ which are defined \r\n  in the complaint as the â€œfuture minor patients with whom [Dr. Marion] came into \r\n  contact.â€Â  This Court addressed a similar situation in Gilmer v. Martin, \r\n  323 S.C. 154, 473 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In Gilmer, this Court \r\n  was specifically asked whether â€œthere should be a duty to warn all â€˜foreseeableâ€™ \r\n  victims, such as in this case, where an identifiable threat exists to a specific, \r\n  small group of individuals.â€Â  Id. at 157-58, 473 S.E.2d at 814.Â  The \r\n  Court refused to extend the duty to warn to all foreseeable victims.Â  Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nBecause Appellants have failed to allege a specific \r\n  threat necessary to compel a duty to warn, the trial court correctly determined \r\n  no legal duty existed under the common law.\r\nII.Â  Negligence Per Se Under Section \r\n  20-7-510\r\nâ€œAn affirmative legal duty, however, \r\n  may be created by statute, contract relationship, status, property interest, \r\n  or some other special circumstance.â€Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 388, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 \r\n  (1999).\r\n&nbsp;  \r\nSection 20-7-510 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\n(A)Â  A physician . . . shall report in accordance with this \r\n  section when in the personâ€™s professional capacity the person has received information \r\n  which gives the person reason to believe that a childâ€™s physical or mental health \r\n  or welfare has been or may be adversely affected by abuse or neglect. \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\n\r\n(D)Â  Reports of child abuse or neglect may be made orally \r\n  by telephone or otherwise to the county department of social services or to \r\n  a law enforcement agency in the county where the child resides or is found. [2] \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-510 (Supp. 2002).\r\nA rule of statutory construction is that any legislation \r\n  which is in derogation of common law must be strictly construed and not extended \r\n  in application beyond clear legislative intent.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Soc. Servs. v. Wheaton, 323 S.C. 299, 302, 474 S.E.2d 156, 158 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996).Â  Therefore, a statute is not to be construed in derogation of common \r\n  law rights if another interpretation is reasonable.Â  Hoogenboom v. City of \r\n  Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 318 n.5, 433 S.E.2d 875, 884 n.5 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nThe main factor in determining whether \r\n  a statute creates a private cause of action is legislative intent.Â  Dorman \r\n  v. Aiken Communications, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 398 S.E.2d 687 (1990). Â In Dorman, \r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court enunciated:\r\n\r\nThe legislative intent to grant or withhold a private right \r\n  of action for violation of a statute or the failure to perform a statutory duty, \r\n  is determined primarily from the language of the statute. . . . In this respect, \r\n  the general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish a civil \r\n  liability, but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the \r\n  public as an entity is not subject to a construction establishing a civil liability. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 67, 398 S.E.2d at 689 (quoting Whitworth \r\n  v. Fast Fare Markets of South Carolina, Inc., 289 S.C. 418, 420, 338 S.E.2d \r\n  155, 156 (1985)).Â  When a statute does not specifically create a private cause \r\n  of action, one can be implied only if the legislation was enacted for the special \r\n  benefit of a private party.Â  Citizens for Lee County v. Lee County, 308 \r\n  S.C. 23, 416 S.E.2d 641 (1992). \r\nThe reporting statute of section 20-7-510 \r\n  does not purport to establish civil liability for the failure to report.Â  The \r\n  statute is silent in that regard.Â  However, a subsequent, related statute imposes \r\n  liability for making a false report.Â  As such, it can reasonably be determined \r\n  the legislative intent was for the reporting statute NOT to create civil \r\n  liability. Â See Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 433-34, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 861, 865 (1996) (finding when one provision does not include a right \r\n  that is included in a related provision, legislative intent is that a right \r\n  will not be implied where it does not exist).\r\nAdditionally, in Rayfield v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (1988), this Court \r\n  announced: \r\n\r\n[W]e are able to derive a test for determining when a duty \r\n  created by statute will support an action for negligence.Â  In order to show \r\n  that the defendant owes him a duty of care arising from a statute, the plaintiff \r\n  must show two things:Â  (1) that the essential purpose of the statute is to protect \r\n  from the kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and (2) that he is a member \r\n  of the class of persons the statute is intended to protect.\r\n\r\nId. at 103, 374 S.E.2d at 914.\r\nThe statute in the instant case is in the portion \r\n  of the Childrenâ€™s Code establishing the policies and procedures of the stateâ€™s \r\n  child welfare services.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-480 (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\n  The statute is concerned with the protection of the public and not with the \r\n  protection of an individualâ€™s private right.Â  This is consistent with other \r\n  jurisdictionsâ€™ interpretations of similar statutes.Â  In C.B. v. Bobo, \r\n  659 So. 2d 98 (Ala. 1995), the Supreme Court of Alabama construed a similar \r\n  statute requiring mandatory reporting and found:\r\n\r\nThe Child Abuse Reporting Act creates a duty owed to the general \r\n  public, not to specific individuals, and, consequently, it does not create a \r\n  private cause of action in favor of individuals. Therefore, to the extent that \r\n  the plaintiffs rely on that statute, they fail to state a cause of action, and \r\n  the trial court properly dismissed the claims insofar as they were based on \r\n  the statute.\r\n\r\nId. at 102; see, e.g., Arbaugh \r\n  v. Board of Educ., County of Pendleton, 591 S.E.2d 235, 241 (W. Va. 2003) \r\n  (finding â€œsame conclusion has been reached by a decided majority of statesâ€); \r\n  Fischer v. Metcalf, 543 So. 2d 785 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989); Borne \r\n  v. Northwest Allen County Sch. Corp., 532 N.E.2d 1196 (Ind. Ct. App. 1989).\r\nAccordingly, we rule that section 20-7-510 \r\n  does NOT give rise to a private cause of action.Â  We further conclude \r\n  section 20-7-510 does NOT support a claim for negligence per se.Â  Apodictically, \r\n  the trial court properly dismissed Appellantsâ€™ claim for negligence per se under \r\n  the statute.\r\nAdditionally, the trial court found the \r\n  statute refers to a report once the psychiatrist has â€œreceived information which \r\n  gives the person reason to believe that a childâ€™s physical or mental health \r\n  or welfare has been or may be adversely affected by abuse or neglect.â€Â  The \r\n  court concluded this meant that specific information about a specific child \r\n  had to be received before a duty to report was created by the statute.Â  The \r\n  complaint failed to allege any specific threat to James Doe.Â  As this finding \r\n  was not appealed, it is the law of the case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. \r\n  v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) \r\n  (holding that an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly determined \r\n  the Amended Complaint failed to allege Dr. Graf owed a duty which would support \r\n  a claim for damages resulting from her failure to warn Appellants of Dr. Marionâ€™s \r\n  propensities.Â  We hold section 20-7-510 of the South Carolina Code does not \r\n  support a private cause of action for failing to report alleged abuse.Â  The \r\n  decision of the trial court to dismiss the action against Dr. Graf pursuant \r\n  to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] \r\n     See Russell v.

Johnson, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nG. Dana Sinkler, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  \r\n  Two truck drivers, Herman Lingard and Randell Williams, were terminated after \r\n  they were discovered at home rather than on their routes.Â  Lingard and Williams \r\n  brought suit against their employer on the basis of the progressive disciplinary \r\n  policy found in their employee handbook.Â  The circuit court determined the handbook \r\n  did not constitute a contract, and even if it did, the employer fulfilled its \r\n  obligations to the employees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHerman Lingard and Randell Williams \r\n  worked as truck drivers at the Branchville facility of Carolina By-Products, \r\n  which is a division of Valley Proteins Company.\r\nDuring their employment, Lingard \r\n  and Williams received an employee handbook.Â  They signed a written â€œReceipt \r\n  of â€˜Employee Handbook,â€™â€ which stated:\r\n\r\nI . . . understand that \r\n  I may terminate my employment at any time, with or without cause, and that the \r\n  Company may terminate me at any time, with or without cause and without liability.Â  \r\n  I know my employment here does not constitute a contract of employment between \r\n  the Company and myself and that this manual is not a contract of employment.\r\n\r\nThe handbook addressed company rules and created \r\n  a progressive disciplinary procedure.Â  Different classes of behavior would result \r\n  in different responses from management.Â  The most serious, Group I, could result \r\n  in immediate discharge.\r\nLingard and Williams drove \r\n  grease trap trucks that went to various restaurant locations in the lowcountry \r\n  and off-loaded the used grease.Â  This was a difficult and dirty position that \r\n  frequently required fifteen-hour workdays.Â  At the start of the day, the drivers \r\n  were required to go to the Branchville facility where their trucks were located.Â  \r\n  Once there, they clocked in.Â  Next, if the grease on their truck had not been \r\n  off-loaded the night before, they had to off-load the grease.Â  Then, the drivers \r\n  performed a pre-trip procedure.Â  This involved checking the truck to see if \r\n  it was in good mechanical condition and inspecting the hoses on the truck.Â  \r\n  Finally, they scaled out, or weighed their truck, and left to begin their route.Â  \r\n  When the drivers scaled out, a ticket with a scale out time was generated.Â  \r\n  When the drivers returned after a day of work, they weighed their truck, which \r\n  again generated a ticket with a time of weighing.\r\nDuring the course of the day, Lingard and Williams \r\n  were allowed a total of one hour in breaks â€” designed to be taken as a thirty \r\n  minute lunch break and two fifteen minute breaks.Â  However, the drivers were \r\n  not required to clock-out during these breaks or otherwise keep a record of \r\n  the breaks taken. \r\nCarolina By-Products was purchased by \r\n  Valley Proteins.Â  Subsequent to this sale, Richard Frank Miller became the general \r\n  plant manager of the facility where Lingard and Williams worked.Â  Melvin Mitchell \r\n  served under Miller as Lingard and Williamsâ€™ route supervisor.Â  Because of a \r\n  lack of productivity, a series of changes was made.Â  These changes, including \r\n  some impacting the drivers, did not lead to the desired increase in productivity.\r\nActing on a workplace rumor, Mitchell \r\n  drove to the houses of Lingard and Williams during the morning on July 6, 2000.Â  \r\n  At approximately 6:45 a.m., the work trucks of both Lingard and Williams were \r\n  parked in front of their houses.Â  On this day, Lingard and Williams had weighed \r\n  their trucks and left the Branchville location at 4:04 a.m. and 3:57 a.m., respectively.Â  \r\n  Mitchell did not immediately take action as he determined â€œ[a]nything can happen \r\n  once,â€Â  and he wanted to give Lingard and Williams the benefit of the doubt.\r\nOn July 12, 2000, Mitchell and Miller \r\n  drove to the houses of Lingard and Williams and again witnessed the work trucks \r\n  parked at the employeesâ€™ homes.Â  Lingard and Williams had both clocked into \r\n  work at 3:42 a.m. and weighed their trucks before leaving at 3:53 a.m. and 3:52 \r\n  a.m., respectively.Â  Mitchell and Miller photographed the trucks located in \r\n  front of the houses of Lingard and Williams at 6:57 a.m. and 6:51 a.m., respectively.Â  \r\n  Mitchell testified he felt the power steering fluid reservoir on Williamsâ€™ truck \r\n  to determine how long it had been sitting there and, based on his experience \r\n  with diesel trucks, determined because the reservoir was cool to the touch the \r\n  truck had not been driven in an hour and forty minutes.Â  He did not perform \r\n  the same test on Lingardâ€™s truck because it was parked on Lingardâ€™s property \r\n  and inaccessible.\r\nOn the afternoon of July 12, 2000, Lingard \r\n  and Williams completed their routes and returned their trucks to the facility.Â  \r\n  Miller met with each separately and presented them with a notice of discharge.Â  \r\n  The notices were virtually identical, stating: â€œYou are hereby discharged from \r\n  Carolina By Products due to not following company rules Group I.â€Â  The notices \r\n  further explain, â€œ[o]ur investigation showed the following: on two occassion \r\n  [sic] Carolinas By Product Truck . . . was sitting at your home.Â  Not being \r\n  at prescribe[d] location at time of incident.Â  Giving false information.â€Â  Neither \r\n  Lingard nor Williams attempted to explain why they were at their houses rather \r\n  than on their routes.\r\nAfter their termination, both Lingard \r\n  and Williams brought suit against Carolina By-Products and Valley Proteins Company \r\n  for wrongful termination.Â  The theory of the action was that the employee handbook \r\n  created an employment contract, the employment contract included a progressive \r\n  disciplinary policy, and their terminations violated that progressive disciplinary \r\n  policy.Â  The case went to trial.Â  At the close of evidence, the circuit court \r\n  granted a directed verdict.Â  The directed verdict was based on the courtâ€™s determination \r\n  there was no employment contract, and even if a contract existed, the employer \r\n  made a good faith decision it had grounds for termination.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict \r\n  and JNOV, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences \r\n  that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party \r\n  opposing the motions and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields \r\n  more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Jinks v. Richland \r\n  County,&nbsp;355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œThe trial \r\n  court can only be reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to support \r\n  the ruling below.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLingard and Williams \r\n  present two arguments on appeal.Â  First, the circuit court erred in concluding \r\n  the employee handbook did not represent an employment contract.Â  Second, the \r\n  circuit court erred in concluding their termination did not violate the promises \r\n  of a progressive disciplinary policy.Â  We agree enough evidence was presented \r\n  to normally require the existence of a contract to be a jury question.Â  However, \r\n  in this case, the circuit court correctly determined there was a reasonable \r\n  good faith belief that sufficient cause existed for termination.\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the doctrine \r\n  of at-will employment.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, \r\n  573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This doctrine provides that a contract for \r\n  permanent employment is terminable at the pleasure of either party when unsupported \r\n  by consideration other than the employerâ€™s duty to provide compensation in exchange \r\n  for the employeeâ€™s duty to perform a service or obligation.Â  Id.Â  However, \r\n  in Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987), \r\n  our supreme court recognized that statements in employee handbooks could be \r\n  strictly enforced against employers as contractual obligations.Â  Id. \r\n  at 485, 357 S.E.2d at 454-55.Â  A contract of employment created by an employee \r\n  handbook is a unilateral contract.Â  See generally Miller v. \r\n  Schmid Lab., Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 414 S.E.2d 126 (1992).\r\nThe Small decision seemed to suggest \r\n  that a conspicuous disclaimer would prevent an alteration of the at-will employment \r\n  status.Â  Small, 292 S.C. at 485, 357 S.E.2d at 455.Â  Yet, Fleming \r\n  v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d 589 (1994), involved a handbook \r\n  that contained a disclaimer and a claim that it was inconspicuous.Â  Id. \r\n  at 460, 450 S.E.2d at 594.Â  In Fleming, the supreme court did not simply \r\n  determine the conspicuousness of the disclaimer, but stated:\r\n\r\nâ€œ[T]he disclaimer is merely one factor to consider in ascertaining \r\n  whether the handbook as a whole conveys credible promises that should be enforced. \r\n  . . . [T]he entire handbook, including any disclaimer, should be considered \r\n  in determining whether the handbook gives rise to a promise, an expectation \r\n  and a benefit.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 463-64, 450 S.E.2d at 596 (quoting \r\n  Stephen F. Befort, Employee Handbooks and the Legal Effect of Disclaimers, \r\n  13 Industrial Relations L. J. 326, 375-76 (1991-92)).\r\nWhen looking at the handbook to determine \r\n  to what degree it gives rise to a promise, an expectation, and a benefit, the \r\n  court must focus on the actual language of the employee handbook.Â  The court \r\n  should consider whether the promises are couched in permissive or mandatory \r\n  language.Â  See Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 606 (2002); see also Jones v. General Elec. Co., 331 S.C. \r\n  351, 503 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1998) (concerning a handbook containing both mandatory \r\n  and permissive language, thus creating a jury issue); see generally \r\n  Note, Conner v. City of Forest Acres: The End of the At-will Employment Era?, \r\n  54 S.C. L. Rev. 1113, 1128 (2003).\r\nExamples of mandatory language from Conner \r\n  include: â€œ(1) violations of the Code of Conduct â€˜will be disciplined,â€™ \r\n  (2) â€˜discipline shall be of an increasingly progressive nature,â€™ and \r\n  (3) â€˜all employees shall be treated fairly and consistently in all matters \r\n  related to their employment.â€™â€Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 464 n.4, 560 S.E.2d \r\n  at 611 n.4 (emphasis in original).Â  Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., 360 S.C. \r\n  58, 599 S.E.2d 456 (2004), is the most recent supreme court case to treat an \r\n  employee handbook.Â  Examples of permissive language in Horton are:\r\n\r\n(1) the disciplinary procedure â€œis to be viewed \r\n  as the guiding policy insofar as taking disciplinary action . . . ;â€ \r\n  (2) â€œsupervisors are not required to go through the entire three steps \r\n  involved in this disciplinary procedure;â€ (3) â€œ[d]iscipline may begin \r\n  at any step in the procedure depending on the seriousness of the offense committed;â€ \r\n  and (4) â€œsupervisor may repeat any of the first two steps of this procedure \r\n  when he feels it is necessary, so long as the discipline is commensurate with \r\n  the offense committed.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 67 n.7, 599 S.E.2d at 461 n.7 (emphasis \r\n  in original).\r\nThis evolution involving the effectiveness \r\n  of disclaimers and the balancing of them against the actual language contained \r\n  in the handbook was recently addressed by the General Assembly.Â  On March 15, \r\n  2004, section 41-1-110 of the South Carolina Code was signed into law.Â  This \r\n  section states that a handbook shall not create an employment contract if it \r\n  is conspicuously disclaimed. [1] Â  \r\n  However, this statute is inapplicable to the case at hand as it only applies \r\n  to handbooks issued after June 30, 2004, and this employee handbook was issued \r\n  to Lingard and Williams on January 21, 1999.\r\nWhile Lingard and Williams signed papers \r\n  acknowledging receipt of the handbooks, and that the handbooks do not constitute \r\n  an employment contract, the handbook creates a progressive disciplinary policy \r\n  that is couched in mandatory terms.Â  The â€œCompany Rulesâ€ section discusses four \r\n  groups of behavior that can lead to varying degrees of punishment.Â  The handbook \r\n  states a violation of each group rule â€œwill subjectâ€ the employee to certain \r\n  levels of disciplinary action.Â  For instance, a Group I violation â€œwill subject \r\n  an employee to disciplinary action ranging from a written reprimand to immediate \r\n  discharge without any previous warning.â€Â  â€œA violation of Group II rules will \r\n  subject an employee to:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Written Warning&nbsp; \r\n        Failure to Earn Attendance/Performance \r\n  Bonus\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Second Offense \r\n        Up to and including Termination.â€\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nâ€œA violation of Group III rules will subject an \r\n  employee to:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Written Warning \r\n        Failure to earn Attendance/Performance \r\n  Bonus\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Second Offense &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Suspension (2 working days)\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Third Offense &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Up to and including Termination.â€\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nâ€œA violation of Group IV rules will subject an employee \r\n  to:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        First Three Offenses\r\n         Written warning and failure \r\n  to earn attendance/performance bonus\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Fourth Offense \r\n         Final written warning and \r\n  suspension (2 working days)\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Fifth Offense &nbsp;\r\n         Up to and including Termination.â€\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe instant case is \r\n  factually similar to this courtâ€™s decision in Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., \r\n  352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In Baril, a handbook purported \r\n  not to change the at-will employment status while simultaneously containing \r\n  a progressive disciplinary policy couched in mandatory terms.Â  Id. at \r\n  282, 573 S.E.2d at 837.Â  Under those facts, this court determined the existence \r\n  of an employment contract is a jury decision.Â  While South Carolina jurisprudence \r\n  has continued to grapple with the existence of employment contracts, this essential \r\n  holding from Baril remains extant.Â  When our courts have found progressive \r\n  disciplinary policies did not create a contract, those policies were couched \r\n  in permissive rather than mandatory terms.Â  For example, the Horton court \r\n  articulated:\r\nThe disciplinary policy in the \r\n  manual provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nThe following is to be viewed \r\n  as the guiding policy insofar as taking disciplinary action for infractions \r\n  of company rules and misconduct is concerned.\r\n  \r\n1.Â  At first offense, if not in \r\n  itself serious enough to warrant suspension or discharge, give warning and advise \r\n  that another offense will result in suspension for 3 days without pay as a disciplinary \r\n  measure. \r\n2.Â  At second offense, if not \r\n  in itself serious enough to warrant discharge, give 3 daysâ€™ suspension without \r\n  pay and warn that another offense may result in discharge.\r\n3.Â  At third offense, discharge, \r\n  and point out to employee that he brought the action on himself and left the \r\n  supervisor without any alternative.\r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nIt should be emphasized again \r\n  that supervisors are not required to go through the entire three steps involved \r\n  in this disciplinary procedure.Â  Discipline may begin at any step in the procedure \r\n  depending on the seriousness of the offense committed.\r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n  \r\nRespondentâ€™s manual exemplifies \r\n  the appropriate manner in which to give employees a guide regarding their employment \r\n  without altering the at-will employment relationship.Â  The manual contained \r\n  conspicuous disclaimers and appellant understood those disclaimers.Â  Further, \r\n  the disciplinary procedure contained permissive language and did not provide \r\n  for mandatory progressive discipline.Â  Appellant, who himself had the responsibility \r\n  of interpreting the manual, stated he interpreted the manual as not limiting \r\n  his ability to terminate employees. Accordingly, the policy manual did not alter \r\n  the employment at-will relationship between appellant and respondent.\r\n\r\nHorton, 360 S.C at 61-68, \r\n  599 S.E.2d at 457-61 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn the present case, the circuit court \r\n  ruled that even if there was an employment contract, the employer did not violate \r\n  the progressive disciplinary policy when it terminated Lingard and Williams.Â  \r\n  Lingard and Williams were terminated after an investigation revealed they had, \r\n  on at least two occasions, spent time for which they were being compensated \r\n  by the company at their homes rather than working their routes.Â  Lingard and \r\n  Williams attempt to argue the final incident was short in duration.Â  However, \r\n  the facts suggest otherwise.Â  Their weigh-out tickets, which signify when they \r\n  left the facility, were at 3:52 a.m. and 3:53 a.m.Â  Both men testified they \r\n  were at the facility longer because they had to prepare their trucks for the \r\n  routes.Â  Yet, this assertion is in direct contrast to the weigh-out tickets.Â  \r\n  Both men testified it took approximately thirty minutes to travel from the facility \r\n  to their houses and they had traveled home to perform quick tasks before beginning \r\n  their dayâ€™s route.Â  Lingard declared he stopped to make sandwiches to eat on \r\n  the road.Â  Williams averred he stopped to shower after performing the long and \r\n  dirty task of cleaning his truck, an assertion that is debased by the fact that \r\n  the time between which he clocked in and weighed out was thirty minutes.Â  The \r\n  testimony regarding a short stop is undercut by testimony and pictures of their \r\n  trucks in front of their houses at 6:51 a.m. and 6:57 a.m.Â  This leaves nearly \r\n  three unaccounted hours.\r\nWhile the mere testimony of the men regarding \r\n  their departure times and quick stops, which could be accounted for by their \r\n  permissible one hour breaks, would typically raise a jury issue, South Carolina \r\n  law does not allow judges and juries to peer unchecked into employment decisions.Â  \r\n  In Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002), \r\n  the supreme court focused on whether there was a reasonable good faith belief \r\n  that sufficient cause existed for terminating Conner.Â  The city terminated Conner, \r\n  a grievance committee reinstated her, and the city council overturned the reinstatement.Â  \r\n  The court found reasonable minds could differ as to whether just cause existed \r\n  to support Connerâ€™s termination and the circuit court should not have granted \r\n  summary judgment.\r\nRecently, in Horton v. Darby Electric Co., \r\n  360 S.C. 58, 599 S.E.2d 456 (2004), the supreme court found, unlike Conner, \r\n  reasonable minds could not differ as to whether just cause existed in support \r\n  of Hortonâ€™s termination and, therefore, summary judgment was appropriate.Â  The \r\n  Horton court explained that even if the handbook was interpreted as altering \r\n  the at-will status, Hortonâ€™s behavior and the evidence demonstrated a reasonable \r\n  good faith belief that sufficient cause existed for termination.Â  Id. \r\n  at 68, 599 S.E.2d at 461.\r\nWhile Group I behavior does not specifically list \r\n  stealing from the employer by spending company time at home, it does enumerate \r\n  theft, falsifying time cards, and giving false information to management.Â  Time \r\n  spent at home performing personal tasks is not time spent working.Â  However, \r\n  Lingard and Williams expected to be paid for this time.Â  Lingard and Williams \r\n  did not affirmatively report time at home to supervisors, instead letting their \r\n  time cards stand uncorrected.Â  Knowing that they were paid based on the times \r\n  reported on their time cards, this was not only theft but also falsification \r\n  of time cards.Â  Furthermore, Lingard and Williams provided false information \r\n  to management by representing themselves as working when they were not.\r\nThe discovery by Mitchell and Miller that Lingard \r\n  and Williams were at home when they were supposed to be on their routes constitutes \r\n  a good faith belief that the behavior of Lingard and Williams justified termination.Â  \r\n  Although Lingard and Williams attempt to portray their time spent at home as \r\n  short and within their allowed breaks, the facts do not support this assertion.Â  \r\n  More importantly, the conclusions of Mitchell and Miller do not have to be uncontested \r\n  fact, but must instead simply be supported by enough evidence to support their \r\n  good faith belief in the cause for termination.Â  The facts support this good \r\n  faith belief that Lingard and Williams were staying at home when they should \r\n  have been working.Â  We conclude that classification of this behavior as Group \r\n  I was made in good faith.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the directed verdict \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Section 41-1-110 reads in full: â€œIt is the public policy of \r\n    this State that a handbook, personnel manual, policy, procedure, or other \r\n    document issued by an employer or its agent after June 30, 2004, shall not \r\n    create an express or implied contract of employment if it is conspicuously \r\n    disclaimed.Â  For purposes of this section, a disclaimer in a handbook or personnel \r\n    manual must be in underlined capital letters on the first page of the document \r\n    and signed by the employee.Â  For all other documents referenced in this section, \r\n    the disclaimer must be in underlined capital letters on the first page of \r\n    the document.Â  Whether or not a disclaimer is conspicuous is a question of \r\n    law.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3881","title":"Mowrer v.

Mowrer appeals a \r\n  directed verdict for the Charleston County Park and Recreation Commission and \r\n  Charleston County (collectively â€œDefendantsâ€) in his lawsuit arising from an \r\n  alleged inverse condemnation of his property.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMowrer and his family own two adjacent properties located at 525 and 529 Mill \r\n  Street in the town of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.Â  Mowrer and his wife purchased \r\n  525 Mill Street in 1987.Â  Their house is located at Shem Creek and overlooks \r\n  the marsh and water.Â  Mowrer owns 529 Mill Street with his brother.Â  \r\n\r\nBoth properties are located near the intersection \r\n  of Simmons and Mill Streets.Â  They are also close to Shem Creek Landing, \r\n  a boat ramp where boats on trailers are put into and pulled from Shem Creek.Â  \r\n  Shem Creek Landing and a nearby parking lot are owned by the County and \r\n  leased to the Commission.\r\nWhen the Mowrers purchased their home, Shem Creek \r\n  Landing was a small, simple boat ramp and unsuitable for large boats.Â  Both \r\n  Mill and Simmons were originally two-way streets.Â  Moreover, the Mowrers \r\n  could access Coleman Boulevard, a main thoroughfare, by driving from their driveway \r\n  directly onto Mill Street.\r\nIn 1992, the Commission approved a $34,000,000 \r\n  bond issue for public works projects.Â  One of the projects, for which \r\n  $3,000,000 from the bond issue had been allocated, failed to go forward.Â  \r\n  At the request of the Charleston County Council, the Commission took over \r\n  all the boat landings in the county, with the agreement that the previously \r\n  allocated $3,000,000 would be used on new boat ramps.Â  In addition, the \r\n  County provided an additional $200,000 to the Commission for this responsibility.\r\nPrior studies had recommended closing Shem Creek \r\n  Landing because of its small size and deplorable condition.Â  The South \r\n  Carolina Department of Natural Resources and the Town of Mount Pleasant, however, \r\n  had already begun redesigning the landing before the Commission became involved.Â  \r\n  The Commission eventually hired an engineer to design and reconfigure the \r\n  landing. \r\nThe engineer submitted a number of landing designs \r\n  to the Commission.Â  Some plans included closing off Mill Street while \r\n  others did not.Â  Similarly, the plans varied as to whether Simmons Street \r\n  would remain a two-way street. \r\nThe renovation plans chosen by the Commission initially \r\n  called for the condemnation of both Mowrer properties.Â  The Mowrers disagreed \r\n  with the Commissionâ€™s appraisal values and obtained second appraisals at the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s expense.Â  These appraisals assigned higher values to both properties.Â  \r\n  Defendants opted not to pay the higher amounts and proceeded with the renovation \r\n  of the boat ramp by working around the Mowrer properties.Â  The project \r\n  was approved by the Town of Mount Pleasant and was completed in the late \r\n  1990s.Â  The parties stipulated that the Commission designed and constructed \r\n  the improvements and made the changes to the boat landing at Shem Creek.\r\nAs a result of the expansion of the boat ramp, \r\n  Simmons Street is used to queue up boaters for the landing.Â  This has resulted \r\n  in vehicles sometimes being parked in front of the Mowrersâ€™ driveway curb cuts, \r\n  thus restricting the Mowrersâ€™ access to their properties.Â  In addition, the \r\n  Mowrers cannot access Simmons Street from the front of their house because the \r\n  road has raised curbs that make it one-directional in the opposite way.Â  \r\n  Also, a median built in connection with the project blocks the Mowrersâ€™ \r\n  direct access to Mill Street.Â  The Mowrersâ€™ driveways now terminate in \r\n  the boat landing itself, requiring them to go through the boat ramp parking \r\n  lot to access Mill Street. \r\nTo reach Coleman Boulevard, the Mowrers must now \r\n  exit their driveway into the parking lot and turn right onto Scott Street before \r\n  finally making a left turn onto Mill Street.Â  If any boaters are backing \r\n  out while the Mowrers attempt to go through the parking lot, the Mowrers have \r\n  to wait for an opportunity to drive forward.Â  Compounding the problem \r\n  is the fact that one of the Mowrer properties has access to the street only \r\n  because the Mowrer family owns the adjacent lot. \r\nThe enhanced landing now attracts more people with \r\n  larger boats.Â  In addition to traffic congestion, the increased use of \r\n  the boat ramp has resulted in more noise, fumes, and litter.Â  An appraiser \r\n  estimated that, because of the boat ramp expansion, the Mowrer properties lost \r\n  one third of their value.\r\nMowrer sued the Commission and the County, alleging \r\n  their actions constituted a taking, an inverse condemnation, and a nuisance. [1] Â  In their responsive pleadings, Defendants denied the allegations \r\n  of the complaint and raised additional defenses, including waiver, failure to \r\n  exhaust administrative remedies, and immunity from suit.\r\nMowrer later moved for partial summary judgment, \r\n  arguing the blocking of his access to Mill Street constituted a taking as a \r\n  matter of law.Â  On the day the trial was to begin, after a jury was drawn \r\n  but before presentation of the testimony, the trial court denied the motion.\r\nAt the conclusion of the testimony, the trial court \r\n  directed a verdict for Defendants.Â  The trial court also denied Mowrerâ€™s post-trial \r\n  motions.\r\n1.Â  Mowrer \r\n  argues the trial court erred in directing a verdict for Defendants on his inverse \r\n  condemnation claim.Â  We agree.\r\nArticle I, Section 13 of the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  prohibits the taking of private property for public use without the payment \r\n  of just compensation. [2] Â  This \r\n  provision â€œextends to all cases in which any of the essential elements of ownership \r\n  has been destroyed or impaired as the result of the construction or maintenance \r\n  of a public street.â€ [3] Â  In \r\n  South Carolina, â€œan obstruction that materially injures or deprives the abutting \r\n  property owner of ingress or egress to and from his property is a â€˜takingâ€™ of \r\n  the property, for which recovery may be had.â€ \r\n  [4] Â  Moreover, â€œ[t]he fact that other means of access to the property are \r\n  available affects merely the amount of damages, and not the right of recovery.â€ [5] \r\nâ€œThe elements of an inverse condemnation are (1) an affirmative, \r\n  positive, aggressive act on the part of the governmental agency, (2) a taking, \r\n  (3) the taking is for a public use, and (4) the taking has some degree of permanence.â€ \r\n  [6] Â  This court has recently held that the erection of a median barrier \r\n  could be an actionable interference with a constitutionally protected property \r\n  right of an abutting landowner. [7] \r\n  \r\nIn granting \r\n  the directed verdict, the trial court held Mowrer failed to prove that Defendants \r\n  had the authority to commit the acts on which his complaint was based. \r\n  [8] \r\nAlthough \r\n  there is authority that only a party with eminent domain power can be sued for \r\n  inverse condemnation, there is also authority to the contrary, i.e., that â€œ[a]s \r\n  long as the state acts through one of its arms in such a way as to deprive an \r\n  individual of his property for public use, it is irrelevant whether the state \r\n  arm doing the actual taking has eminent domain power.â€ [9] Â  \r\nCase law \r\n  from this jurisdiction would seem to indicate that South Carolina follows the \r\n  latter view. [10] Â  Moreover, \r\n  we find persuasive the reasoning in Fountain v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid \r\n  Transit Authority, wherein the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that \r\n  â€œ[a]s long as the state acts through one of its arms in such a way as to deprive \r\n  an individual of his property for public use, it is irrelevant whether the state \r\n  arm doing the actual taking has eminent domain power.â€ [11] Â  In so holding, the court \r\n  gave the following explanation:\r\n\r\n  If a private party were unable to seek redress under the just compensation \r\n    clause when an official agency acts outside its statutory powers and takes \r\n    property for public use, the state would be able to escape liability under \r\n    the just compensation clause by taking property through agencies without statutory \r\n    powers of eminent domain.Â  We think that the threat of this kind of shell \r\n    game ought to be avoided . . . . [12] \r\n\r\nBased on this reasoning, we hold that whether Defendants \r\n  had the authority to commit the acts about which Mowrer has complained is not \r\n  relevant to the question of whether these acts amounted to an unconstitutional \r\n  taking of his property for public use.Â  The fact that the Commission lacked \r\n  eminent domain power did not render its affirmative, positive, aggressive acts \r\n  concerning the Mowrer properties any less a taking within the meaning of Article \r\n  I, Section 13 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  It was therefore an error \r\n  of law to direct a verdict against Mowrer on the ground that he did not name \r\n  the Town as a defendant.\r\n2.Â  Defendants argue that a directed verdict in \r\n  their favor should be affirmed because Mowrer failed to prove the elements of \r\n  inverse condemnation.Â  We decline to address this argument [13]  and note that, since the present case was \r\n  tried, there has been at least one appellate decision in this State that appears \r\n  relevant to this issue. [14] \r\n3.Â  We decline to address Mowrerâ€™s arguments that \r\n  he was entitled to an order of summary judgment and a directed verdict.Â  The \r\n  denial of summary judgment is not appealable, even after final judgment, [15]  and the record does not include \r\n  Mowrerâ€™s directed verdict motion. \r\n  [16] \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Both Mowrerâ€™s wife and brother executed assignments to Mowrer for \r\n    the prosecution of this action.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  See S.C.

Nelson \r\n  (Nelson) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Charleston \r\n  County Parks and Recreation Commission (CCPRC) on Nelsonâ€™s action for breach \r\n  of employment contract.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCCPRC hired Nelson as a Maintenance Specialist \r\n  in May 1996, as an at-will employee, and terminated him on February 22, 2001, \r\n  following a nearly one-month probationary period for substandard performance.Â  \r\n  For the last two years of Nelsonâ€™s employment with CCPRC, he worked as the James \r\n  Island County Maintenance Crew Chief.Â  The position required him to maintain \r\n  James Island County Parkâ€™s buildings, water park, campground, utilities, and \r\n  miscellaneous other structures.Â  The position required, among other things, \r\n  moderately heavy manual work, technical skills, supervisory knowledge, and the \r\n  ability to act independently on the job site.Â Â  \r\nCCPRC terminated Nelsonâ€™s employment on or about \r\n  February 22, 2001, because his job performance progressively deteriorated for \r\n  at least the last eight months of his employment, despite CCPRCâ€™s continuing \r\n  efforts to encourage and prompt him to improve his poor and substandard performance.Â  \r\n  CCPRC, through Nelsonâ€™s direct supervisor and two of CCPRCâ€™s long-tenured managers, \r\n  repeatedly attempted to correct Nelsonâ€™s excessive and unacceptable performance \r\n  problems by giving him several oral and written reprimands, counselings, and \r\n  warnings beginning in July of 2000. \r\nNelson failed to show improvement in any of the \r\n  areas recommended for corrective action over the next six months. Â Effective \r\n  February 1, 2001 until July 31, 2001, CCPRC placed Nelson on six months probation, \r\n  expressly setting forth the improvements expected from him during that time \r\n  period, including providing his direct supervisor with a list of goals and objectives \r\n  by February 15, 2001.Â  Nelson interpreted the probationary status as creating \r\n  a six-month employment contract, though no particular document, oral statement, \r\n  or other evidence supported his position.Â Â  \r\nNelson failed to prepare the list of goals.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  his poor and inadequate planning resulted in his crew abandoning one work project \r\n  on February 8, 2001, and delaying two others.Â  On February 22, 2001, Nelsonâ€™s \r\n  direct supervisor and the two managers agreed to terminate Nelsonâ€™s employment \r\n  for â€œfailure to comply with requirements while on probationary status . . . \r\n  failure to perform work properly or follow work instruction.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nNelson filed a cause of action for wrongful termination \r\n  under an employment contract on October 31, 2001 against CCPRC, alleging CCPRC \r\n  altered his employment at-will status when it placed him on probation for his \r\n  progressively poor job performance.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment \r\n  to CCPRC and dismissed the case with prejudice. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment \r\n  motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial \r\n  court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: summary \r\n  judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \r\n  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. \r\n  Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002); Ferguson v. Charleston \r\n  Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2002).Â  In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which \r\n  can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, \r\n  350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 539 (2002); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 \r\n  S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues \r\n  must go to the jury.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. \r\n  714, 718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate where \r\n  further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application \r\n  of the law.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 \r\n  S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against \r\n  the moving party.Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. \r\n  115, 120, 542 S.E.2d 736, 738 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Even when there is no dispute \r\n  as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be \r\n  drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied.Â  See Hall v. Fedor, \r\n  349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Moreover, summary \r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â Â  Lanham \r\n  v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 336 (2002); \r\n  Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d \r\n  271 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  CCPRCâ€™s Actions in Putting Nelson \r\n  on Probation\r\nNelson maintains the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to \r\n  Nelson as the nonmoving party, material issues of genuine fact exist concerning \r\n  whether Nelsonâ€™s probationary period altered his at-will employment status by \r\n  creating an employment contract between the parties.Â  We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes the doctrine of employment \r\n  at-will.Â  See Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, \r\n  516 S.E.2d 923 (1999).Â  This doctrine provides that a contract for permanent \r\n  employment is terminable at the pleasure of either party when unsupported by \r\n  any consideration other than the employerâ€™s duty to provide compensation in \r\n  exchange for the employeeâ€™s duty to perform a service or obligation.Â  See \r\n  id. â€œAt-will employment is generally terminable by either party at any \r\n  time, for any reason or no reason at all.â€Â  Id. at 334, 516 S.E.2d at \r\n  925.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have carved out \r\n  exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine.Â  See Small v. Springs \r\n  Indus., Inc., 300 S.C. 481, 388 S.E.2d 808 (1990) (Small II); Davis \r\n  v. Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 240, 542 S.E.2d 755 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  First, an employee has recourse against an employer for termination \r\n  in violation of public policy.Â  Small II, 300 S.C. at 484, 388 S.E.2d \r\n  at 810; Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d \r\n  213 (1985).Â  Second, an at-will employee may not be terminated for exercising \r\n  constitutional rights.Â  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 335 n.3, 516 S.E.2d at \r\n  925 n.3; Moshtaghi v. The Citadel, 314 S.C. 316, 443 S.E.2d 915 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994).Â  Finally, an employee has a cause of action against an employer \r\n  who contractually alters the at-will relationship and terminates the employee \r\n  in violation of the contract.Â  Davis, 344 S.C. at 246-47, 542 S.E.2d \r\n  at 758.Â  An employer and employee may contractually alter an at-will employment \r\n  relationship, and as a result, limit the ability of either party to terminate \r\n  the employment relationship without incurring liability.Â  See Small \r\n  v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987) (Small I); \r\n  Baril, 352 S.C. at 281, 573 S.E.2d at 836; see also Culler \r\n  v. Blue Ridge Elec. Coop., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 422 S.E.2d 91 (1992) (emphasizing \r\n  that the doctrine of employment at-will in its pure form allows an employer \r\n  to discharge an employee for good reason, no reason, or bad reason without incurring \r\n  liability).Â  For example, an employee handbook \r\n  [1]  may create a contract altering an at-will arrangement.Â  See \r\n  Small II, 300 S.C. at 484, 388 S.E.2d at 810; Baril, 352 S.C. \r\n  at 281, 573 S.E.2d at 836; see also Davis, 344 S.C. at 247, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d at 758 (instructing that in certain situations, termination of at-will \r\n  employee may give rise to cause of action where at-will status of employee is \r\n  altered by terms of employee handbook).Â  Thus, an employerâ€™s written documents \r\n  can alter the at-will relationship and create an implied employment contract, \r\n  but only if the employer phrases the documentâ€™s language in mandatory terms \r\n  giving â€œrise to a promise, an expectation and a benefitâ€ to an employee.Â  Fleming \r\n  v. Borden, Inc., 316 S.C. 452, 463, 450 S.E.2d 589, 596 (1994).\r\nThe written reprimands, counselings, and warnings, \r\n  including the notification of probation letter, wholly lacked any mandatory \r\n  and promissory language guaranteeing Nelson continued or future employment.Â  \r\n  CCPRCâ€™s policies and practices accurately reflected its at-will status throughout \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s tenure.Â  Furthermore, the CCPRC never promised or guaranteed that it \r\n  would ever employ Nelson on any basis except as an at-will employee, as admitted \r\n  by Nelson.Â Â  \r\nFurther, Nelson claims the following passage, from \r\n  CCPRCâ€™s â€œprobationâ€ section of the â€œDisciplinary Actionâ€ policy in the Personnel \r\n  Policies and Procedures Manual, constituted an implied contract:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n Probation:Â Â  This is defined as a specific \r\n  period of time usually 3-6 months, which shall cause the affected employee to \r\n  lose his or her regular status.Â  This may be used as an alternative action if \r\n  deemed appropriate.Â  Any infraction of Commission policies during this period \r\n  may result in more severe disciplinary action, depending on the facts of the \r\n  case.Â  Periods of disciplinary action shall be set forth in writing to the employee \r\n  referencing the reason and/or disciplinary action which invoked the period of \r\n  probation, notifying the employee that a special performance appraisal will \r\n  be conducted at the close of the probationary period.Â  An interim counseling \r\n  session must be conducted.Â  The use of probation must be approved by the Executive \r\n  Director.\r\n\r\nThis Court has applied standard principles of contract \r\n  interpretation in determining whether an employee handbook constitutes an employment \r\n  contract.Â  â€œWhere an action presents a question as to the construction of a \r\n  written contract and the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous,â€ \r\n  the alleged contract shall determine the â€œrights and obligations of the parties.â€Â  \r\n  Holden v. Alice Mfg., Inc., 317 S.C. 215, 220, 452 S.E.2d 628, 631 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994).Â  \r\nThe foregoing policy did not create an implied \r\n  contract.Â  In fact, it gave the Commission discretion to impose â€œmore severe \r\n  disciplinary actionâ€ during the probationary period.Â  The only mandatory language \r\n  used in the paragraph is in relation to the procedures that should be followed \r\n  when initially administering the probation.Â  \r\nThis case differs from Conner v. City of Forest \r\n  Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002), because the employer in Conner \r\n  used mandatory terms such as â€œshallâ€ and â€œwillâ€ in its employee handbook to \r\n  the extent that the grievance committee voted to reinstate the employee, proving \r\n  to the supreme court that â€œreasonable minds could differ.â€Â  Id. at 464, \r\n  560 S.E.2d at 612.Â  Not only did CCPRCâ€™s managers and Nelsonâ€™s direct supervisor \r\n  unanimously agree to terminate his employment, CCPRCâ€™s Executive Director upheld \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s termination upon his appeal.Â  Furthermore, unlike the employee in Conner, \r\n  Nelson reiterates that he was always employed on an at-will basis with CCPRC.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nNelson could not identify any particular document \r\n  or oral statement that supported his position.Â  During Nelsonâ€™s deposition, \r\n  he testified:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n        Is there any other reason why you believe your status \r\n  as an at-will employee was altered?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.\r\n        No.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n        Is there any language, any written language, that you can show me in \r\n  any document that weâ€™ve traded back and forth in this case that would support \r\n  your position?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         Iâ€™m not sure.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Is there anything in the exhibit stack here today that you can go back \r\n  and show me that you think supports your position in that regard?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n        Iâ€™m not sure if it will or not.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nEven in his deposition, Nelson confirms \r\n  that there is no genuine issue as to a material fact concerning whether an employment \r\n  contract resulted from the probationary period.Â  For example, Nelson testified:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         Weâ€™ll read that sentence [from the policy manual] \r\n  that starts: â€˜There is no particular order in which the above-noted disciplinary \r\n  actions must be used. The Commission reserves in its sole discretion the option \r\n  to utilize any disciplinary action at any time.â€™Â  [. . .] Doesnâ€™t that one paragraph \r\n  indicate to you that the Commission again could terminate someone at its sole \r\n  discretion at any time without following any particular steps?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         I guess so.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n        . . . You would agree thatâ€™s what this \r\n  paragraph says?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n        Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         And you understood this to be the policy of the Commission \r\n  throughout your employment there?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n        . . . [Y]ou would agree that the Commission throughout \r\n  your employment maintained the right to terminate an employee at any time without \r\n  necessarily exhausting any particular steps or procedures?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         I donâ€™t think itâ€™s right.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         I understand that you donâ€™t think itâ€™s right, but \r\n  you understood that that was the policy of the Commission?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        . . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         And that was the policy throughout your employment \r\n  there?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.\r\n         As far as I know.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFinding that an employment contract resulted from \r\n  this probationary period would lead to the result of giving greater rights and \r\n  job security to employees whose performance had fallen below the employerâ€™s \r\n  expectations.Â  Even Nelson could see the absurdity in this result as apparent \r\n  by his testimony during his deposition:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.\r\n         \r\n  . . .

Co., 335 S.C. \r\n  222, 516 S.E.2d 449 (1999), the supreme court held that an employee subject \r\n  to a notice provision prior to termination is not an employee at-will, and, \r\n  therefore, discharge of that employee for refusing to violate a law was against \r\n  public policy.Â  Id. at 224, 516 S.E.2d at 450.Â  Stiles is easily \r\n  distinguishable from the case at hand.Â  In Stiles, the employer inserted \r\n  an employment end date in the policy, signifying a term by which the employment \r\n  would be guided, not simply the ending of a probationary period.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  In the instant case, Nelson never alleged any public policy violation or claimed \r\n  that the Commission promised him any specific notice prior to terminating him.Â  \r\n  In fact, Nelson confessed that his performance had not been up to par.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  CCPRCâ€™s Actions in Terminating \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s Employment\r\nNelson claims the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to \r\n  Nelson as the nonmoving party, material issues of fact exist regarding whether \r\n  CCPRCâ€™s actions in terminating his employment breached an employment contract \r\n  between CCPRC and Nelson.Â  We disagree.\r\nEven if the parties had entered into a contract, \r\n  we find CCPRCâ€™s actions would not constitute a breach.Â  When an employment contract \r\n  only permits termination for cause, the appropriate test on the issue of breach \r\n  focuses on whether the employer had a â€œreasonable good faith belief that sufficient \r\n  cause existed for termination.â€Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 \r\n  S.C. 454, 464, 560 S.E.2d 606, 611 (2002).Â  â€œ[T]he fact finder must not focus \r\n  on whether the employee actually committed misconduct; instead, the focus must \r\n  be on whether the employer reasonably determined it had cause to terminate.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 464-65, 560 S.E.2d at 611.\r\nCCPRC had a unanimous, reasonable good faith belief \r\n  that Nelson had failed or refused to improve his poor and substandard performance \r\n  in any respect, giving CCPRC substantial cause to terminate his employment.Â  \r\n  Nelsonâ€™s managers and direct supervisor notified him on several different occasions \r\n  of the deficiencies in his performance.Â  He was given set guidelines through \r\n  two performance memorandums in July 2000 and January 2001, attempting to coach \r\n  Nelson to succeed so he could continue his employment with CCPRC as a productive \r\n  and satisfactory employee.Â  As a last ditch effort, management agreed to place \r\n  Nelson on probation and executed a Disciplinary Action report, which stated \r\n  the areas that needed improvement.Â  The main areas included his ability to effectively \r\n  manage time and resources, his ability to understand the requirements necessary \r\n  to accomplish or complete a project, his knowledge of budgets and correctly \r\n  allocating those funds, and his ability to plan goals and objectives for the \r\n  crew, which the management asked be compiled and turned in to his immediate \r\n  supervisor by February 15, 2001. \r\nHe admittedly failed in all these tasks.Â  His crew \r\n  abandoned a work project at a fishing dock due to a lack of materials.Â  A shower \r\n  valve project was delayed because he failed to have the proper equipment available.Â  \r\n  A seam replacement project was delayed because he failed to make available the \r\n  proper safety equipment and gave unclear directions to his crew.Â  Lastly, he \r\n  never provided his supervisor with the requested list of goals and objectives.Â Â  \r\n\r\nNelson professed that, as an employee on probation, \r\n  he would be more closely scrutinized and at a greater risk for termination than \r\n  before he was placed on probation.Â  Nelsonâ€™s theory that the probationary status \r\n  created an employment contract goes against the very crux of being on probation.Â  \r\n  For Nelson to prevail, this Court would need to find that CCPRC granted greater \r\n  job security to probationary employees than to employees who were more successful, \r\n  better performing workers.Â  We refuse to reach that illogical result.\r\nWe hold the probationary status did not create \r\n  an employment contract, and, even if a contract had been formed, CCPRCâ€™s actions \r\n  did not constitute a breach.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the circuit court \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  This Court notes the recent amendment to the Code of Laws of South \r\n    Carolina regarding employee handbooks.Â  However, this amendment is not applicable \r\n    to the current action as it was enacted subsequent to the institution of this \r\n    action.Â  Section 41-1-110 of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n  \r\n  It is the public policy \r\n    of this State that a handbook, personnel manual, policy, procedure, or other \r\n    document issued by an employer or its agent after June 30, 2004, shall not \r\n    create an express or implied contract of employment if it is conspicuously \r\n    disclaimed.Â  For purposes of this section, a disclaimer in a handbook or personnel \r\n    manual must be in underlined capital letters on the first page of the document \r\n    and signed by the employee.Â  For all other documents referenced in this section, \r\n    the disclaimer must be in underlined capital letters on the first page of \r\n    the document.Â  Whether or not a disclaimer is conspicuous is a question of \r\n    law.\r\n  \r\n  Act No. 185, 2004 S.C.
