Burgdorf, Master In Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3703\r\nSubmitted November 3, 2003 â€“ Filed December \r\n  8, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRonald R. Hall, of West Columbia, Pro Se.\r\nJohn G. Felder, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:  Alice Sims, Jr., initiated \r\n  this legal malpractice action against Ronald R. Hall alleging he was negligent \r\n  in failing to provide competent advice regarding the administration of her deceased \r\n  motherâ€™s estate.Â  The trial court found Hall was negligent and awarded Sims \r\n  $191,543 in actual damages.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n Alice Sims, Jr.â€™s sister, Georgia Sims, \r\n  died intestate on January 14, 1997.Â  Their mother, Alice Sims, Sr., died later \r\n  that year on September 1, 1997.Â  As personal representative of both estates, \r\n  Alice Sims, Jr., retained Hall to advise her as she concluded her motherâ€™s and \r\n  sisterâ€™s affairs.\r\nGeorgia Sims died without a valid will.Â  \r\n  Her estate passed to Alice Sims, Sr., under South Carolinaâ€™s intestate succession \r\n  statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-103(2) (Supp. 2002) (providing if \r\n  there is no surviving spouse or surviving issue, the entire estate passes to \r\n  the intestateâ€™s parents).Â  As a result, when Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate was settled \r\n  in 1998, it was subject to substantially higher tax liability because Georgia \r\n  Simsâ€™ property had become part of Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate.Â  \r\nThe taxing of Georgia \r\n  Simsâ€™ property as part of her motherâ€™s estate could have been avoided if Alice \r\n  Sims, Sr. (during the last few months of her life) or Alice Sims, Jr. (as personal \r\n  representative of Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate after her death) had executed a â€œqualified \r\n  disclaimerâ€ under section 2518 of the Internal Revenue Code.Â  See 26 \r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 2518 (2003).Â  South Carolina adopted the Internal Revenue Codeâ€™s \r\n  disclaimer requirements for its estate tax laws.Â  Section 12-16-1910 (1976) \r\n  of the South Carolina Code provides that â€œif a person as defined in Section \r\n  62-2-801 makes a disclaimer as provided in Internal Revenue Code Section 2518 \r\n  with respect to any interest in property, this chapter applies as if the interest \r\n  had never been transferred to the person.â€ \r\nBy exercising the right of disclaimer, a person relinquishes \r\n  all rights to, or â€œdisclaims,â€ property received by gift, will, or intestate \r\n  succession.Â  This is done almost exclusively to garner favorable tax consequences.Â  \r\n  In this case, if a valid disclaimer of Georgia Simsâ€™ property had been made \r\n  by Alice Sims, Sr., or on behalf of her estate by Alice Sims, Jr., the property \r\n  of Georgia Sims would have been treated for tax purposes as though it had never \r\n  passed to Alice Sims, Sr.\r\nThe right of disclaimer cannot, however, \r\n  be exercised at any time.Â  A party wishing to disclaim her interest in property \r\n  received must do so within the statutorily prescribed time limit.Â  The time \r\n  period is enunciated in section 2518, which provides, in pertinent part, that \r\n  the written disclaimer must be â€œreceived by the transferor of the interest, \r\n  his legal representative, or the holder of the legal title to the property to \r\n  which the interest relates not later than the date which is 9 months after . \r\n  . . the day on which the transfer creating the interest in such person is made.â€Â  \r\n  26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2518(b)(2)(A).Â  For the purposes of the present appeal, the unappealed \r\n  rulings of the trial court establish as the law of this case that the date of \r\n  â€œtransferâ€ under section 2518 was the date of Georgia Simsâ€™ death. [2]  Â \r\nAlice Sims, Jr., served as the personal representative \r\n  of Georgia Simsâ€™ estate and Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate during this nine-month \r\n  time period for disclaimer following Georgia Simsâ€™ death.Â  It is undisputed \r\n  that Hall, as Alice Sims, Jr.â€™s attorney during this time, never advised her \r\n  of the benefits of disclaiming Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s interest in Georgia Simsâ€™ estate.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAlice Sims, Jr., instituted this action against \r\n  Hall, claiming he was professionally negligent in failing to advise her of the \r\n  right to disclaim Georgia Simsâ€™ estate.Â  The case was tried without a jury before \r\n  the Master-in-Equity of Orangeburg County.Â  The trial court found Hallâ€™s failure \r\n  to discuss the option of executing a disclaimer fell below the standard of care \r\n  owed to Sims. Â The court ruled that Alice Sims, Jr., was legally entitled \r\n  to exercise the right of disclaimer on behalf of her motherâ€™s estate and she \r\n  would have disclaimed had she been informed of the option by Hall.Â  As to damages, \r\n  the court found that the failure to execute a disclaimer resulted in additional \r\n  tax liability of $191,543.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law tried without a jury, \r\n  an appellate courtâ€™s scope of review extends only to the correction of errors \r\n  of law.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998) \r\n  (citing Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, \r\n  86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976)); Campbell v. Marion County Hosp. Dist., \r\n  354 S.C. 274, 280, 580 S.E.2d 163, 165-66 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, the factual \r\n  findings of the trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review \r\n  of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. \r\n  606, 621, 533 S.E.2d 886, 893 (2000); Townes, 266 S.C. at 86, \r\n  221 S.E.2d at 775; Scott v. Greenville Hous. Auth., 353 S.C. 639, \r\n  645, 579 S.E.2d 151, 154 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHall appeals the trial courtâ€™s judgment, \r\n  arguing: (A) Respondent did not properly establish that he owed a duty to inform \r\n  her of the disclaimer rights or that he breached this duty, and (B) Respondent \r\n  failed to present sufficient evidence supporting the trial courtâ€™s finding he \r\n  proximately caused the damages. [3] \r\n  Â  In an action for legal malpractice, the claimant must prove four elements: \r\n  (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) breach of a duty by \r\n  the attorney; (3) damage to the client; and (4) proximate causation of the client's \r\n  damages by the breach.Â  Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, \r\n  322 S.C. 433, 435 n.2, 472 S.E.2d 612, 613 n.2 (1996); McNair v. Rainsford, \r\n  330 S.C. 332, 342, 499 S.E.2d 488, 493 (Ct. App. 1998). Â \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Standard of Care and Breach\r\nGenerally, a plaintiff in a legal malpractice case \r\n  must establish the standard of care by expert testimony, unless the subject \r\n  matter is of common knowledge to laypersons.Â  Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, \r\n  McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 435, 472 S.E.2d 612, 613 (1996); Hall \r\n  v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 174, 561 S.E.2d 654, 657 (Ct. App. 2002); Henkel \r\n  v. Winn, 346 S.C. 14, 18, 550 S.E.2d 577, 579 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, \r\n  this court held in Mali v. Odom that expert testimony is not required \r\n  where the defendant admits the standard of care that was owed to the plaintiff.Â  \r\n  295 S.C. 78, 81, 367 S.E.2d 166, 168 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The same result is warranted \r\n  in the present case.\r\nIn Mali, the plaintiffs brought \r\n  a legal malpractice action against their attorney alleging negligent misrepresentation \r\n  at a real estate closing.Â  Id. at 79, 367 S.E.2d at 168.Â  The court found \r\n  the plaintiffs were not required to establish by expert testimony the applicable \r\n  standard of care because the defendant attorney conceded in written responses \r\n  to the plaintiffsâ€™ interrogatories that he had a duty to disclose restrictions \r\n  on the subject property and explain the legal impact of those restrictions to \r\n  his clients.Â  Id. at 81, 367 S.E.2d at 168.\r\nIn the present case, Hall admitted in his Memorandum \r\n  in Support of Summary Judgment filed with the circuit court that, during the \r\n  nine-month time period of the disclaimer right, Alice Sims, Jr.â€™s â€œcounsel of \r\n  recordâ€ had a duty to advise her regarding the option to execute a disclaimer.Â Â  \r\n  In his motion for summary judgment and supporting memorandum, however, the lynchpin \r\n  of Hallâ€™s argument was that he was not the â€œcounsel of recordâ€ during the nine-month \r\n  disclaimer period. [4] Â  Therefore, \r\n  in addressing the duty to advise Sims of her right to disclaim, Hall states \r\n  in the memorandum:\r\n\r\nAs Defendant was not Plaintiffâ€™s attorney at the time of \r\n  the transfer, nor had any knowledge or dealings with either Estate, the Defendant \r\n  could not have advised Plaintiff regarding her option to file a Disclaimer.Â  \r\n  It follows then that the Defendant owed no duty to Plaintiff to advise her regarding \r\n  her option to file a Disclaimer.Â  That duty lay with her then counsel of record.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Hall abandoned the argument that he was \r\n  not Simsâ€™ attorney after his motion for summary judgment was denied.Â  He now \r\n  concedes that he was Simsâ€™ attorney during the disclaimer period. \r\nHall argues that his statement in his summary judgment \r\n  memorandum does not constitute an admission of the standard of care because \r\n  he made the statement while arguing that someone else was Simsâ€™ \r\n  counsel of record during the disclaimer period.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission of the standard of care need not \r\n  be an admission of wrongdoing by the defendant.Â  To the contrary, the purpose \r\n  of establishing the appropriate standard of care is simply to arm the finder \r\n  of fact with the appropriate criteria by which to judge the defendantâ€™s conduct.Â  \r\n  Cianbro Corp. v. Jeffcoat &amp; Martin, 804 F. Supp. 784, 791 (D.S.C. \r\n  1992).Â  In Mali, the defendant admitted his duty to disclose the restrictions \r\n  on the subject property, but he did not admit he breached that duty.Â  See \r\n  also Stallings v. Ratliff, 292 S.C. 349, 356 S.E.2d 414 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987) (finding testimony of defendant physicianâ€™s own expert and defendant himself \r\n  established the applicable standard of care, even though defendant denied he \r\n  breached that standard).Â  Thus, Hallâ€™s argument that his statement in his summary \r\n  judgment memorandum does not constitute an admission establishing the standard \r\n  of care because it was not made in connection with an admission of wrongdoing \r\n  is in error.\r\nWe hold Hall established the appropriate standard \r\n  of care by his own admission and expert testimony was not required in this case.\r\nDespite his admission, Hall contends he did not \r\n  breach his duty to advise Alice Sims, Jr., of her rights to execute a disclaimer \r\n  because he did not have knowledge of the size of Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate during \r\n  the time he was the attorney for the estate.Â  Because he did not know the amount \r\n  of the estate, Hall claims he had no way to determine if there would be possible \r\n  tax consequences.\r\nThis argument is meritless.Â  Hall acknowledged that he was \r\n  familiar with the concept of disclaimer.Â  Moreover, he has admitted that he \r\n  had a duty to inform Sims of the right of disclaimer.Â  As an attorney familiar \r\n  with the concept, Hallâ€™s duty to advise his client whether disclaimer would \r\n  be to her advantage cannot be abrogated by mere ignorance of his clientâ€™s affairs.Â  \r\n  Hallâ€™s duty to inform Sims of the right of disclaimer compelled him to ascertain \r\n  if executing a disclaimer was in his clientâ€™s interest or, at a minimum, advise \r\n  her of the existence or significance of a disclaimer.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Proximate Cause\r\nHall next asserts that he did not proximately \r\n  cause Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate to be subject to additional tax liability because \r\n  Alice Sims, Sr. (1) took possession and, therefore, â€œacceptedâ€ Georgia Simsâ€™ \r\n  property, and (2) â€œdirectedâ€ its disposition to Alice Sims, Jr.â€”actions Hall \r\n  claims contravene the right of disclaimer under section 2518.Â  We address these \r\n  claims seriatim.\r\nProximate cause requires proof of causation in \r\n  fact and legal cause.Â  Oliver v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. \r\n  Transp., 309 S.C. 313, 316, 422 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992); Hurd v. Williamsburg \r\n  County, 353 S.C. 596, 611, 579 S.E.2d 136, 144 (Ct. App. 2003); Trivelas \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 135, 558 S.E.2d 271, 276 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Oliver, \r\n  309 S.C. at 316, 422 S.E.2d at 130; Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 \r\n  S.C. 448, 463, 494 S.E.2d 835, 842 (Ct. App. 1997); Vinson v. Hartley, \r\n  324 S.C. 389, 400, 477 S.E.2d 715, 721 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Legal cause is proved \r\n  by establishing foreseeability.Â  Bray v. Marathon Corp., Op. No. 25733 \r\n  (S.C. Sup.Ct. filed October 13, 2003) (Shearouse Search Term Begin Search \r\n  Term End Adv. Sh. No. 37 at 36). Â For an act to be a proximate cause of the \r\n  injury, the injury must be a foreseeable consequence of the act.Â  Young v. \r\n  Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 475, 242 S.E.2d 671, 681 (1978); Small, \r\n  329 S.C. at 463, 494 S.E.2d at 842-43.Â  Although foreseeability of some injury \r\n  from an act or omission is a prerequisite to establishing proximate cause, the \r\n  plaintiff need not prove that the actor should have contemplated the particular \r\n  event which occurred.Â  Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 54, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  251, 253 (1991); Bramlette v. Charter-Med.-Columbia, 302 S.C. 68, 74, \r\n  393 S.E.2d 914, 916 (1990).\r\nThe defendant may be held liable for anything which appears \r\n  to have been a natural and probable consequence of his negligence.Â  Greenville \r\n  Memâ€™l Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 245, 391 S.E.2d 546, 548 (1990); \r\n  Childers v. Gas Lines, Inc., 248 S.C. 316, 325, 149 S.E.2d 761, 765 (1966).Â  \r\n  Proximate cause does not mean the sole cause.Â  Bishop v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 89, 502 S.E.2d 78, 83 (1998); Hurd, \r\n  353 S.C. at 613, 579 S.E.2d at 145.Â  The defendantâ€™s conduct can be a proximate \r\n  cause if it was at least one of the direct, concurring causes of the injury.Â  \r\n  Hughes v. Childrenâ€™s Clinic, P.A., 269 S.C. 389, 398, 237 S.E.2d 753, \r\n  757 (1977); Small, 329 S.C. at 464, 494 S.E.2d at 843.\r\n 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlice Sims, Sr., did not â€œacceptâ€ Georgia Simsâ€™ estate. \r\n   \r\n Under section 2518, a person may validly \r\n  execute a disclaimer only if â€œsuch person has not accepted the interest or any \r\n  of its benefits.â€Â  Hall claims Alice Sims, Sr., took constructive possession \r\n  of Georgia Simsâ€™ property and thereby â€œacceptedâ€ it.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved \r\n  for appellate review.Â  Though Hall pled this defense in his answer to plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  complaint, the trial court did not rule upon the question of whether Alice Sims, \r\n  Sr., accepted Georgia Simsâ€™ property, and Hall did not raise the issue in his \r\n  post-trial Motion to Modify or Amend Judgment and Motion for a New Trial.Â  Post-trial \r\n  motions to amend or modify judgment are necessary to preserve issues that have \r\n  been raised to the trial court but not ruled upon.Â  Bailey v. Segars, \r\n  346 S.C. 359, 365, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001); see also \r\n  Creech v. South Carolina Marine Wildlife Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 34, \r\n  491 S.E.2d 571, 576 (1997) (holding that appellate court cannot address an issue \r\n  unless the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the issue is not properly before this court.Â  Even if we were to reach the merits \r\n  of Hallâ€™s argument, however, we would still affirm the trial courtâ€™s judgment.\r\nWe find no evidence in the record before us sufficient \r\n  to warrant finding Alice Sims, Sr., accepted Georgia Simsâ€™ property.Â  In defining \r\n  the parameters of â€œacceptanceâ€ under section 2518, the applicable treasury regulation \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nA qualified disclaimer cannot be made with respect to an \r\n  interest in property if the disclaimant has accepted the interest or any of \r\n  its benefits, expressly or impliedly, prior to making the disclaimer. Acceptance \r\n  is manifested by an affirmative act which is consistent with ownership of the \r\n  interest in property. Acts indicative of acceptance include using the property \r\n  or the interest in property; accepting dividends, interest, or rents from the \r\n  property; and directing others to act with respect to the property or interest \r\n  in property. However, merely taking delivery of an instrument of title, without \r\n  more, does not constitute acceptance.\r\n\r\n26 C.F.R. Â§ 25.2518-2(d)(1) (2003).Â  When determining whether \r\n  a disclaimant has accepted the property, we do not look to a single act or declaration, \r\n  but rather the court must examine the disclaimantâ€™s conduct in toto.Â  See \r\n  80 Am. Jur. 2d Wills Â§ 1364 (2002) (noting â€œacceptance of a devise or \r\n  bequest need not be express but may be shown by the acts or conduct of the beneficiaryâ€ \r\n  and â€œacceptance . . . occurs if the party with the expectancy interest exercises \r\n  dominion and control over the property in the capacity of a beneficiaryâ€).Â  \r\n  A beneficiary of property in an estate will not be deemed to have accepted the \r\n  property as long she â€œleaves the disputed property in the possession of the \r\n  estate and does not unreasonably disrupt the orderly and timely distribution \r\n  of the estate assets.â€Â  In re Estate of Watkins, 572 So. 2d 1014, 1015 \r\n  (Fla. App. 1991); see also Jordan v. Trower, 208 Ga. App. \r\n  552, 553, 431 S.E.2d 160, 162 (1993) (finding that a will beneficiaryâ€™s acceptance \r\n  of approximately $460 from an estate prior to filing of a will for probate, \r\n  for beneficiaryâ€™s use in purchasing clothing for funeral and other expenses, \r\n  did not constitute type of acceptance or possession of property of estate that \r\n  would preclude her from timely renouncing her interest; beneficiary did not \r\n  obtain, nor even seek, possession of property of estate as a whole and undertook \r\n  no actions that would indicate an intention to assert an ownership interest \r\n  in the property of the estate); Niklason v. Ramsey, 233 Va. 161, 164, \r\n  353 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1987) (holding that a beneficiaryâ€™s contract to divide \r\n  his motherâ€™s estate prior to execution of disclaimer operated as dominion and \r\n  control over the estate, thereby precluding disclaimer).\r\nIn this case, Hall points to his testimony that Alice Sims, \r\n  Sr., had â€œtaken possessionâ€ of Georgia Simsâ€™ house after her death because she \r\n  â€œhad the house cleaned upâ€ and she â€œsold the furniture out of the house.â€ Â Â Without \r\n  more, this conduct does not evidence such dominion and control as to have precluded \r\n  Alice Sims, Sr., or the personal representative of her estate from making a \r\n  valid disclaimer.\r\nImportant to this determination is the fact that \r\n  both Alice Sims, Sr., prior to her death, and Alice Sims, Jr., served as personal \r\n  representatives of Georgia Simsâ€™ estate, qualifying them as fiduciaries of the \r\n  estate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-703(a) (1987).Â  As fiduciaries, the \r\n  Treasury Regulation defining acceptance under section 2518 provides that their \r\n  actions â€œto preserve or maintain the disclaimed property shall not be treated \r\n  as an acceptance of such property or any of its benefits.Â  Under this rule, \r\n  for example, an executor who is also a beneficiary may direct the harvesting \r\n  of a crop or the general maintenance of a home.â€Â  \r\n  26 C.F.R. Â§ 25.2518-2(d)(2) (emphasis added).Â  Alice Sims, Sr., therefore, did \r\n  not prejudice her right to execute a qualified disclaimer by acting to preserve \r\n  her late daughterâ€™s estate.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alice Sims, Sr., did not direct the \r\n  disposition of Georgia Simsâ€™ estate.\r\nUnder 26 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2518(b)(4), a disclaimer \r\n  is valid only if the interest being refused â€œpasses without any direction on \r\n  the part of the person making the disclaimer.â€Â  Hall claims that prior to her \r\n  death, Alice Sims, Sr. â€œplanned and directedâ€ Georgia Simsâ€™ estate go directly \r\n  to Alice Sims, Jr., thereby precluding her from effecting a valid disclaimer.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAs a threshold matter, this question is \r\n  not preserved for appellate review because the trial court did not rule upon \r\n  this issue and Hall did not raise the issue in his post-trial Motion to Modify \r\n  or Amend Order.Â  For the same reasons cited regarding preservation of the prior \r\n  issue, this question is not properly before this court.Â  Again, however, even \r\n  if we reach the merits, we would affirm the trial courtâ€™s judgment. \r\nThe applicable Treasury Regulation has interpreted the requirement \r\n  that the interest pass without direction by the disclaimant as meaning: â€œIf \r\n  there is an express or implied agreement that the disclaimed interest in property \r\n  is to be given or bequeathed to a person specified by the disclaimant, the disclaimant \r\n  shall be treated as directing the transfer of the property interest.â€Â  26 C.F.R. \r\n  Â§ 25.2518-2(e)(1).\r\nAs evidence that Alice Sims, Sr., had such an agreement \r\n  prior to disclaimer to dispose of Georgia Simsâ€™ estate, Hall cites the trial \r\n  testimony of Alice Sims, Jr.: \r\n\r\n[W]e [Alice Sims, Sr., and Alice Sims, Jr.] both felt that \r\n  Georgiaâ€™s estate should come directly to me. At the time I had been told by \r\n  Mr. Hall that I was co-heir with my . . . mother.Â  And I said, well, then I \r\n  want, we want mamaâ€™s portion, mamaâ€™s half to come directly to me.\r\n\r\nThis statement does not evidence an agreement between \r\n  Alice Sims Jr., and her mother to â€œdirectâ€ the transfer of Georgia Simsâ€™ property \r\n  as contemplated under section 2518.Â  To the contrary, this testimony reveals \r\n  nothing more than Alice Sims, Jr., and Alice Sims, Sr., simply inquiring with \r\n  their attorney about the possibility of disclaimer.Â  Hall asks this court to \r\n  find that Alice Sims, Sr.â€”by saying that she wanted to disclaim her interestâ€”is \r\n  barred from making such a disclaimer because she directed the transfer of the \r\n  property.Â  This argument strains credulity.Â  If this procedure was followed, \r\n  lawyers advising clients on matters of estate administration would be unable \r\n  to engage their clients in meaningful conversations about their wishes for the \r\n  distribution of property for fear of foregoing disclaimer and other similar \r\n  options.Â  We decline to adopt this approach.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did not err in ruling \r\n  Respondent had established the proper standard of care in this case and Hall \r\n  breached that duty, proximately resulting in substantial, additional taxable \r\n  assets accruing to Alice Sims, Sr.â€™s estate.Â  Concomitantly, the judgment of \r\n  the Master is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2] Â Â  Prior to trial, there was a dispute among the parties concerning \r\n    the date on which a â€œtransferâ€ occurs under section 2518.Â  Hall contended \r\n    the â€œtransferâ€ of Georgia Simsâ€™ property to Alice Sims, Sr., did not occur \r\n    until the date the deed of distribution transferred title.Â  Alice Sims, Jr., \r\n    claimed the transfer occurred on the date Georgia Sims died.Â  In ruling on \r\n    Hallâ€™s motion for summary judgment, the circuit court found that the date \r\n    of transfer, for the purposes of transfer by intestacy, was the date of Georgia \r\n    Simsâ€™ death.Â  \r\n  Hall did not appeal the courtâ€™s summary judgment order and later conceded at \r\n    trial that, to be effective, disclaimer of Georgia Simsâ€™ property must have \r\n    occurred within nine months after her death.Â  Unappealed rulings become the \r\n    law of the case and should not be reconsidered by this court.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition \r\n    Fund, L.P. v.

Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 266, \r\n    442 S.E.2d 611, 616 (1994).Â  Accordingly, this Court will not rule on the \r\n    legal question as to the date on which the transfer occurred under section \r\n    2518.Â  In the present appeal, the date of transfer will be the date of Georgia \r\n    Simsâ€™ death.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    In the Appellantâ€™s â€œStatement of Issues on Appeal,â€ he lists as an \r\n    issue whether â€œthe trial court err[ed] in finding the Respondent had proven \r\n    damages in the amount of $191,453.00.â€Â  In the body of the brief, however, \r\n    this issue is not discussed.Â  Our stateâ€™s appellate courts have consistently \r\n    held that issues raised on appeal but not argued in the brief will not be \r\n    considered by the court.Â  See, e.g, Jinks v. Richland County, \r\n    355 S.C. 341, ___, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003) (holding the court will not \r\n    consider issues raised on appeal but not argued in the body of the brief); \r\n    Fields v.

Coker, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Edward D. Sloan, Jr., individually, \r\n  and as a citizen, resident, taxpayer and registered elector of Greenville County, \r\n  and on behalf of all others similarly situated, brought this action against \r\n  Greenville County alleging it failed to comply with county ordinances governing \r\n  the procurement of construction services when it awarded contracts for the completion \r\n  of three public works projects.Â  The trial court ruled the procurement processes \r\n  met the statutory standard with respect to two of these projects, while the \r\n  third project did not.Â  Both Sloan and the County appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Greenville County Code (â€œG.C.C.â€ or \r\n  â€œthe Codeâ€) prescribes the methods the County may use to award contracts for \r\n  construction services.Â  As a general rule, the code requires that all contracts \r\n  must be awarded by the â€œcompetitive sealed biddingâ€ method.Â  G.C.C. Â§ 7-212.Â  \r\n  This method of source selection proceeds in multiple stages.Â  The County must \r\n  first hire an architect or other design professional to prepare the initial \r\n  plans and specifications for the new construction project.Â  After the County \r\n  has approved these initial plans, the design professional will typically draft \r\n  a detailed set of construction drawings and specifications that will become \r\n  part of a â€œbid package.â€Â  The County will then use the bid package to publicly \r\n  solicit bids from contractors to perform the work.Â  The lowest responsible, \r\n  responsive bidder is awarded the project.\r\nUnder the Code, the County must use the \r\n  competitive sealed bidding method to procure construction services over $15,000 \r\n  unless one of several specific exceptions applies.Â  See G.C.C. Â§Â§ 7-212 \r\n  â€“ 7-242.5.Â  One of these exceptionsâ€”the focal point of this caseâ€”is known as \r\n  the â€œdesign-buildâ€ procurement method. \r\n  [1] Â  See Â§ 7-242.5. \r\nThe design-build method differs from traditional \r\n  competitive sealed bidding in two important ways.Â  First, under the design-build \r\n  method, the County enters into a single contract for design and construction \r\n  of the project.Â  This arrangement condenses the two-step process of competitive \r\n  sealed bidding in which the County procures design services and then contracts \r\n  separately for the actual construction.Â  Design-buildâ€™s single source procurement \r\n  also enables design and construction to proceed concurrently, thereby shortening \r\n  project duration.Â  Once a design â€œfootprintâ€ for a structure has been prepared, \r\n  a contractor may begin work such as grading and excavating a site, while a designer \r\n  continues to design the structure.\r\nSecond, the design-build method allows comparative \r\n  subjective evaluations to be made when determining acceptable proposals for \r\n  negotiation and award of the contract.Â  Price need not be the sole or primary \r\n  criterion for evaluating competing proposalsâ€”it may be only one of several factors \r\n  considered.Â  The County may select the design-build team based on other factors \r\n  such as experience, project team members, and expertise.\r\nIt is design-buildâ€™s lack of objective, bright-line \r\n  criteria that raises concerns about its use.Â  Critics espouse that design-build \r\n  vests too much discretion with the governing body regarding when and to whom \r\n  public contracts are awarded.Â  Because price is not a controlling factor in \r\n  design-build source selection, the public entity may not always receive the \r\n  lowest, most competitive price possible.Â  See e.g., Sloan v. \r\n  Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 342 S.C. 515, 521, 537 S.E.2d 299, 302 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (opining that â€œ[t]his court has long maintained that â€˜[m]unicipal \r\n  competitive bidding laws are enacted to guard against such evils as favoritism, \r\n  fraud or corruption in the award of contracts, to secure the best product at \r\n  the lowest priceâ€™â€).Â  Without proper guidelines and oversight, design-build \r\n  may foster the impression that the government is somehow less accountable for \r\n  its decisions as to how it spends taxpayer money.\r\nFor these reasons, the use of design-build is limited \r\n  under the Code to those situations in which it is properly justified.Â  Greenville \r\n  Countyâ€™s design-build ordinance sets out when it may be used:\r\n\r\nThe county administrator or his designee shall have the discretion to use construction \r\n  management services, design-build services, or turnkey management services as \r\n  alternatives for construction contracting administration.Â  In exercising such \r\n  discretion, the county administrator or his designee shall consider the method \r\n  which is the most advantageous to the county and will result in the most timely, \r\n  economical, and successful completion of the construction project.Â  The determination \r\n  for the method of source selection utilized shall be stated in writing and included \r\n  as part of the contract file.\r\n\r\nG.C.C. Â§ 7-242.5(a). Â The Countyâ€™s discretion \r\n  to use design-build instead of competitive sealed bidding source selection is \r\n  therefore limited to those occasions when it is in the best interests of the \r\n  Countyâ€”a determination that must be in writing and available for public consumption \r\n  in the contract file.\r\nAt issue before us is whether Greenville \r\n  County properly justified its decision to use the design-build method to award \r\n  three multi-million dollar construction contracts.Â  Specifically, we must decide \r\n  whether the written determinations were sufficient under section 7-242.5 of \r\n  the Code.\r\nThe Construction Projects\r\nThe contracts \r\n  for the three construction projects were awarded in 1999 and 2000.Â  Construction \r\n  services for all three were obtained using the design-build method. \r\nTwo of these contracts were for road-building projects \r\n  that were part of a special infrastructure improvement program called the â€œPrescription \r\n  for Progressâ€ plan.Â  This plan, approved by Greenville County Council in 1997, \r\n  called for the expenditure of eighteen million dollars for the repair and resurfacing \r\n  of approximately 148 lane miles on more than 400 county roads through the year \r\n  2010.Â  The two projects at issue are Prescription for Progress road improvement \r\n  programs for years 2000 and 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the â€œRoads 2000â€ \r\n  and â€œRoads 2001â€ projects).Â  For the Roads 2000 project, the County procured \r\n  $6,759,100 of road construction services. Â In the Roads 2001 project, \r\n  the County obtained $12 million in road construction services.\r\nThe third construction contract was for the renovation \r\n  of the criminal forensics lab at the Countyâ€™s law enforcement center in 1999.Â  \r\n  The County procured $290,000 in construction services to complete this project.\r\nThis Action\r\nAfter each of these contracts was awarded, \r\n  Sloan brought suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, contending the \r\n  procurements violated the Code.Â  The primary issueâ€”common to all three casesâ€”was \r\n  the validity of the Countyâ€™s determination to use design-build source selection \r\n  rather than competitive sealed bidding in awarding the contracts.Â  As additional \r\n  causes of action, Sloan asserted the County did not obtain sufficient performance \r\n  and payment bonds for the Roads 2000 project, and he claimed the Forensics Lab \r\n  contract did not properly define the responsibilities and rights of the parties, \r\n  both in violation of the Greenville County Code.Â  In answering Sloanâ€™s charges, \r\n  the County asserted the cases were not justiciable because Sloan did not have \r\n  standing to challenge the Countyâ€™s actions and the questions presented were \r\n  moot, preventing the court from awarding any effective relief. \r\nThe trial court consolidated the three cases for \r\n  trial. Â The court decided these actions were properly justiciableâ€”ruling that \r\n  Sloan had standing to bring suit and the case was not subject to dismissal for \r\n  mootness.Â  With respect to the validity of the written determinations to use \r\n  design-build source selection, the court deemed the determinations for the Roads \r\n  2000 and Roads 2001 projects were sufficient under the Code.Â  It pronounced, \r\n  however, the written determination for the Forensics Lab project did not satisfy \r\n  the Codeâ€™s requirements.Â  As to the other claims asserted: The court adjudged \r\n  the County had failed to obtain sufficient bonds for the Roads 2000 project.Â  \r\n  It found the Forensics Lab contract sufficiently defined the rights and duties \r\n  of the parties.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe County contends this court should apply an â€œany \r\n  evidenceâ€ standard of review rather than a â€œpreponderance of the evidenceâ€ standard.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn actions at law, on appeal of a case tried without \r\n  a jury, the lower court must be affirmed where there is any evidence which reasonably \r\n  supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Strickland v.

Young, 229 S.C. 519, 534-35, 93 S.E.2d 873, 881 (1956) (examining \r\n  the substance of the pleadings throughout the case and the evidence introduced \r\n  at trial in its determination whether the action sounded in law or equity).\r\nAlthough the County asserts the main purpose of \r\n  this action is to construe a written contract, it seems clear that Sloanâ€™s main \r\n  concern is to enjoin the County from awarding contracts in a manner he claims \r\n  is ultra vires under the Countyâ€™s procurement code.Â  Sloan brought \r\n  this action as a citizen and taxpayer of Greenville County, not as a private \r\n  individual seeking redress under the terms of a particular contract.Â  In his \r\n  complaint, Sloan only requested a declaration that the contracts were illegal \r\n  and should be set aside.Â  At trial, the testimony introduced concerned only \r\n  the sufficiency of the Countyâ€™s determination that design-build was the proper \r\n  method of source selection for the construction projects.Â  Sloan did not pray \r\n  for damages in his pleadings, and the court awarded none.Â  Indeed, by the time \r\n  the case reached trial, the projects at issue had already been completed.Â  The \r\n  gravamen of the action, therefore, is merely to prevent the County from awarding \r\n  future public works contracts in the manner employed in the present case.\r\nA case with legal and equitable issues presents \r\n  a divided scope of review.Â  Perry v.

School District of Greenville County, 342 \r\n  S.C. 515, 537 S.E.2d 299 (Ct. App. 2000), in which the court examined taxpayer \r\n  standing on largely similar facts.Â  In Sloan, the plaintiff brought an \r\n  action against the school district seeking a declaratory judgment that the district \r\n  violated its procurement regulations by entering into construction contracts \r\n  without following the prescribed competitive sealed bidding procedure.Â  Id. \r\n  at 517-18, 537 S.E.2d at 300.Â  The contracts at issue had been awarded under \r\n  an exception which allowed the district to award contracts without competitive \r\n  sealed bidding when there was an emergency need for the procurement of construction \r\n  and other services.Â  Id. at 517, 537 S.E.2d at 300.Â  The plaintiff challenged \r\n  the districtâ€™s determination that the procurement without competitive sealed \r\n  bidding was justified under this exception.Â  Id. at 518, 537 S.E.2d at \r\n  300.Â  As in the case sub judice, the plaintiff had no private interest \r\n  in the contracts and had not submitted a bid for the construction work.Â  Id.\r\nThe court first held the plaintiff had \r\n  standing to sue as an individual taxpayer, finding the plaintiff, as a taxpaying \r\n  citizen of Greenville County, had â€œa direct interest in the proper use and allocation \r\n  of tax receipts by the District.â€ Id. at 522, 537 S.E.2d at 303.Â  The \r\n  court grounded its reasoning on the rationale articulated by our supreme court \r\n  in Mauldin v. City Council of Greenville, 33 S.C. 1, 11 S.E. 434 (1890), \r\n  a case challenging the governmentâ€™s expenditure of public funds.Â  There, the \r\n  court held: \r\n\r\nThe injury charged as the result \r\n  of the acts complained of is a private injury, in which the tax-payers of the \r\n  county . . . are the individual sufferers, rather than the public.Â  The people \r\n  out of the county bear no part of the burden; nor do the people within the county, \r\n  except the tax-payers, bear any part of it.Â  It is therefore an injury peculiar \r\n  to one class of persons, namely the tax-payers of the county.\r\n\r\nId. at 20, 11 S.E. at 436 (quoted in Sloan, \r\n  342 S.C. at 519, 537 S.E.2d at 301).Â  \r\nThe court decreed the plaintiff had standing \r\n  because the question presented was of such substantial public importance as \r\n  to warrant a resolution for future guidance.Â  Sloan, 342 S.C. at 522-24, \r\n  537 S.E.2d at 303-304.Â  The court noted, â€œthe public interest involved is the \r\n  prevention of the unlawful expenditure of money raised by taxation.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 523, 537 S.E.2d at 303.Â  With specific regard to procurement of services \r\n  for public works projects, the court opined:\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of public funds \r\n  pursuant to a competitive bidding statute is of immense public importance.Â  \r\n  Requiring that contracts only be awarded through the process of competitive \r\n  sealed bidding demonstrates the lengths to which our government believes it \r\n  should go to maintain the publicâ€™s trust and confidence in governmental management \r\n  of public funds.Â  The integrity of the competitive sealed bidding process is \r\n  so important that in some states â€œonce a contract is proved to have been awarded \r\n  without the required competitive bidding, a waste of public funds [is] presumed \r\n  . . . without showing that the municipality suffered any alleged injury.â€\r\n\r\nId.  at 524, 537 S.E.2d at 303 (alteration \r\n  in original) (quoting 18 Eugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations \r\n  Â§ 52.26 (3d ed. 1993)).\r\nWe find the courtâ€™s reasoning in Sloan \r\n  compels the same result in the case at bar.Â  Here, Sloanâ€™s interest as a taxpayer \r\n  in how public funds were spent is virtually identical.Â  The projects were large \r\n  and altogether required the expenditure of millions of taxpayer dollars.Â  This \r\n  burden was borne exclusively by the taxpaying citizens of Greenville County.Â  \r\n  Sloan, therefore, had a real, material, and substantial interest in whether \r\n  the County followed the procurement procedures set out in the county codeâ€”procedures \r\n  specifically designed to ensure wise management of the public fisc.Â  \r\nThe issue in the present case is also of sufficient \r\n  public importance to confer standing.Â  Because the fundamental issue is the \r\n  same as in the School District caseâ€”whether a competitive bidding procurement \r\n  scheme was properly followedâ€”the reasons underlying the courtâ€™s finding of public \r\n  importance apply with equal force in the instant case.Â  Resolution of this issue \r\n  will likely have an impact on government practices beyond the confines of the \r\n  case itself.Â  Greenville County and other public entities must be accountable \r\n  under the laws and regulations which govern how they spend public money.Â Â  Allowing \r\n  interested citizens a right of action in our judicial system when issues are \r\n  of significant public importance ensures this accountability and the concomitant \r\n  integrity of government action.\r\nFor these reasons, we find the trial court \r\n  correctly ruled Sloan had standing to pursue this declaratory judgment action.\r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Mootness\r\n\r\nThe County argues this case is not justiciable because \r\n  the issues presented are moot.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn general, this court may only consider cases \r\n  where a justiciable controversy exists.Â  See Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., \r\n  321 S.C. 426, 430, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996).Â  â€œA justiciable controversy is \r\n  a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial \r\n  determination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract \r\n  dispute.â€Â  Pee Dee Elec.

Greater Greenville \r\n  Sewer District, 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88 (1947).Â  In Ashmore, the \r\n  plaintiff sought to enjoin a government body from issuing bonds to fund the \r\n  construction and maintenance of a new auditorium.Â  Id. at 85, 44 S.E.2d \r\n  at 91.Â  The trial court denied the request for injunction.Â  Id.Â  An election \r\n  was held in which the voters approved the sale of bonds, thereby rendering the \r\n  issue moot.Â  Id.Â  The court nevertheless decided the case was justiciable \r\n  because the issues raised were of substantial public importance, opining:\r\n\r\nIf this were an ordinary case, \r\n  our opinion might well stop here. . . . But the case is not an ordinary one; \r\n  it is not a private controversy between individuals, as such.Â  On the contrary, \r\n  it is defended by an intended governmental agency which the legislature undertook \r\n  to create by their enactments; and raised on the record are earnestly argued \r\n  public questions of importance.Â  The last stated factor brings into play the \r\n  principle, now generally established, that questions of public interest originally \r\n  encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance, however abstract \r\n  or moot they may have become in the immediate contest.\r\n\r\nId. at 96, 44 S.E.2d at 96-97; see also \r\n  Berry v.

Jur. 2d Actions Â§ 50 \r\n  (2003) (noting the general rule that â€œcourts will not decide moot questions \r\n  is subject to an exception where the question, though moot, is . . . likely \r\n  to recur and evade judicial resolution in the futureâ€).Â  The party bringing \r\n  the action need only show the issue raised is capable of repetition and \r\n  is not required to prove there is a â€œreasonable expectationâ€ the issue will \r\n  arise again.Â  Byrd, 321 S.C. at 431-32, 463 S.E.2d at 864 (finding South \r\n  Carolina has adopted the â€œlenientâ€ approach to evading review analysis).\r\nWe find the present case presents an issue that \r\n  is likely to recur but evade review.Â  By design, the procurement codeâ€™s exception \r\n  allowing use of design-build source selection accelerates the process of awarding \r\n  public works contracts and the ultimate completion of the projects themselves.Â  \r\n  Sloan initiated the actions in the present case within one week after the contracts \r\n  were executed or the Countyâ€™s written determination was filed.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  construction on all three projects was complete prior to the beginning of trial \r\n  in this case.Â  Because the fundamental inquiry in this case concerns the validity \r\n  of using an expedited procurement process, it is improbable similar challenges \r\n  can navigate the litigation process before the question becomes a purely academic \r\n  one.\r\nFor these reasons, we find a justiciable \r\n  controversy exists in the present case despite the mootness of the questions \r\n  presented.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Sufficiency of the Written Determinations\r\nHaving found Sloanâ€™s claims to be properly \r\n  reviewable by this court, we review whether the written determinations published \r\n  by the County are sufficient under the Greenville County Code.Â  The Countyâ€™s \r\n  decision to use design-build source selection rather than the traditional competitive \r\n  sealed bidding method is discretionary.Â  G.C.C. Â§ 7-242.5(a).Â  The Code provides \r\n  little guidance, however, as to what the County should consider when making \r\n  its decisionâ€”couching its directives in the most general terms: â€œIn exercising \r\n  such discretion, the county administrator or his designee shall consider the \r\n  method which is the most advantageous to the county and will result in the most \r\n  timely, economical, and successful completion of the construction project.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nIn reviewing the discretionary decision \r\n  of a legislative body, our courts have been loath to substitute their judgment \r\n  for that of elected representatives.Â  Such decisions â€œshould not be upset on \r\n  appeal unless [they are] arbitrary, unreasonable, in obvious abuse of discretion, \r\n  or in excess of lawfully delegated power.â€Â  Smith v. Georgetown County Council, \r\n  292 S.C. 235, 238-39, 355 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing Bob Jones \r\n  Univ. v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351, 133 S.E.2d 843 (1963)); see \r\n  also 62 C.J.S. Municipal Corporations Â§ 196(b) (1999) (commenting \r\n  that â€œdiscretionary action on the part of a municipality is subject to judicial \r\n  review where the action is manifestly arbitrary or discretion is clearly abusedâ€).\r\nOur review must be guided by the express legislative \r\n  intent underlying Greenville Countyâ€™s procurement code: \r\n\r\nIt is the intent of the county \r\n  council that the primary concern of county government be the effective provision \r\n  of services to the citizens of the county in the most efficient and economical \r\n  way possible, and that all purchases of goods and services needed to provide \r\n  these services be conducted with primary concern for the efficient and economical \r\n  use of revenues provided by those citizens. \r\n\r\nG.C.C. Â§ 7-192.Â  Included among the â€œunderlying \r\n  purposes and policiesâ€ of the procurement ordinances, is the direction to â€œpromote \r\n  increased public confidence in the procurement regulations, procedures, and \r\n  practices used by this county,â€ â€œmaximize the purchasing value of public funds,â€ \r\n  and â€œprovide safeguards for maintaining a procurement system of quality and \r\n  integrity.â€ Â§ 7-192(b)(2), (3) &amp; (6).\r\nIn light of the Codeâ€™s express mandate \r\n  and guiding policy, it is apparent the written determination required under \r\n  section 7-242.5 must serve a dual function: The determination must first effectively \r\n  inform county council of the reasons why design-build source selection works \r\n  to the Countyâ€™s best advantage for the project at issue.Â  Equally important, \r\n  the determination must provide the citizens of Greenville County a window into \r\n  the Countyâ€™s decision-making processâ€”safeguarding the quality and integrity \r\n  of the contract awards through public accountability.Â  If the written determination \r\n  provides sufficient factual grounds and reasoning for the County Council and \r\n  the public to make an informed, objective review of these decisions, then it \r\n  has accomplished its purpose.\r\nBearing these twin aims in mind, we examine \r\n  each of the written determinations for the Roads 2000, Roads 2001, and Forensics \r\n  Lab projects.\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Roads 2000 Determination\r\n\r\nThe written determination to use design-build \r\n  source selection for the Roads 2000 project was prepared by Gerald Seals, the \r\n  Greenville County Administrator from 1993 to 2000.Â  Sealâ€™s determination addresses \r\n  the County Councilâ€™s time, budget, and quality requirements and sets forth the \r\n  project-specific reasons why design-build rather than traditional competitive \r\n  sealed bidding procurement serves to better meet the Countyâ€™s goals.Â Â  \r\nThe determination first addressed the Roads 2000 \r\n  projectâ€™s particular time and budget requirements.Â  Seals described how the \r\n  special, expedited road paving needs outlined by the Prescription for Progress \r\n  plan significantly exceeded the Countyâ€™s timeline and budget capacity for road \r\n  improvements.Â  He also noted that, less than four months before the date of \r\n  this determination, the County Council reaffirmed its commitment to the Prescription \r\n  for Progress program and â€œits goal and commitment to improve County roads by \r\n  2010.â€\r\nÂ Given these requirements, Seals concluded the \r\n  design-build method of source selection would best address the County Councilâ€™s \r\n  mandate under the Prescription for Progress program that extensive road improvements \r\n  be completed rapidly while not affecting any other County services.Â  Seals cited \r\n  his particular experience using the design-build method in past projects: â€œThese \r\n  projects were fast-tracked and let using the [design-build] procurement method \r\n  to satisfy tight time schedules, quality and budget requirements.â€Â  Seals then \r\n  offered several reasons why traditional low-bid, competitive sealed bidding \r\n  procurement would hinder the Countyâ€™s ability to achieve its project objectives.Â  \r\n  He noted:\r\n\r\nLow bid is a slower process that \r\n  [will] require[] the County [to] subdivide the varied aspects of the 1999-2000 \r\n  Road Improvement Program into specific and disparate sections and individually \r\n  solicit a low bid for each service component and each individual road.Â  It should \r\n  be noted that the 1999-2000 Road Improvement Program encompasses more than one-hundred \r\n  (100) roads.Â  Broad service components include: general engineering, specific \r\n  individual engineering of each of the one-hundred roads included in the program, \r\n  quality control, drainage inspection and engineering, inspections, and paving.Â  \r\n  Individualized low bid solicitation for each road and/or service components \r\n  means that completing the 1999-2000 Road Improvement Program would likely take \r\n  more than one (1) year, not the twelve (12) months mandated by County Council.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Seals found that â€œ[s]trict low bid \r\n  procurement solicitation does not eliminate bid rigging or fraudâ€ and can result \r\n  in â€œlow ball biddingâ€ in which the vendor who submitted the lowest bid â€œknowingly \r\n  or as a result of inexperience, increases the actual contract using change orders \r\n  or refusing to proceed until the government corrects its program by increasing \r\n  the contract.â€Â  He stated: â€œThe factors for analysis under low bid procurement \r\n  [are] limitedâ€”specifically, the ability to analyze a vendorâ€™s history of change \r\n  orders due to the submission of unrealistically low bids, or vendorâ€™s actual \r\n  history of performance track record, is restrictedâ€ and that â€œ[l]ow bid procurement \r\n  will require excessive staff time and thus adversely affect other services, \r\n  such as pothole and drainage repair.â€\r\nWe find this determination provided ample \r\n  grounds to support the County Councilâ€™s decision to approve use of the design-build \r\n  method.Â  It addressed the specific needs of the project and weighed the alternative \r\n  methods for procuring construction services, providing the County Council and \r\n  interested members of the public clear insight into the rationale underlying \r\n  its decision to use design-build.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly ruled \r\n  this determination was sufficient under section 7-242.5.\r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Roads \r\n  2001 Determination\r\n\r\n The written \r\n  determination for the Roads 2001 project was prepared by John Hansley, who was \r\n  serving at the time as acting county administrator.Â  Hansley sets forth a detailed \r\n  basis for the decision to use design-build.\r\nAs with the Roads 2000 determination, \r\n  this determination addressed the special challenges presented by the extensive, \r\n  expedited roads improvement program called for under the Prescription for Progress \r\n  plan.Â  Hansley affirmed: â€œThe department is faced with budget limitations, increased \r\n  workloads, three major construction projects and seven designs of projects, \r\n  as well as a one-year timeframe for the program coupled with overlapping roadwork \r\n  and special projects from the previous fiscal year.â€\r\nTo meet the goals of the road improvement \r\n  program for 2001, Hansley made project-specific findings that additional staff \r\n  would need to be hired to ensure proper engineering, quality control, and inspection \r\n  for the various components of the project if the County used the traditional \r\n  procurement methods.Â  The determination contains specific projections of these \r\n  additional costs which Hansley estimated would total over a million dollars.Â  \r\n\r\nHansley discussed the Countyâ€™s past success \r\n  using design-build source selection for large, complex and expedited construction \r\n  projects.Â  The determination provided specific details about past projects in \r\n  the form of comprehensive empirical evidence showing six design-build construction \r\n  contracts where the project was completed on time and on budget.Â  Hansley concluded:\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the County has \r\n  utilized this process [design-build] since the inception of the Prescription \r\n  for Progress Road Program in 1997.Â  In my opinion, it can be firmly stated that \r\n  the competitive proposal method has proven to be valuable to the County.\r\n. . . Thus, the public/private \r\n  partnership will afford the County an opportunity to continue its commitment \r\n  to providing optimal public services.Â  At the same time, the aggressive road \r\n  improvement program will continue to meet Councilâ€™s expectations.\r\n\r\nThe determination addressed the project-specific \r\n  needs of the County, the Countyâ€™s previous experience with design-build, and \r\n  a comparison of the alternative methods.Â  An ample factual basis therefore exists, \r\n  supporting the conclusion that design-build source selection â€œshould benefit \r\n  the County by allowing it to accomplish its goals and deadlines in a timely \r\n  manner, while providing day-to-day services to citizens.â€Â  The County Council \r\n  and the public were well served by Hansleyâ€™s written determination, and the \r\n  trial court correctly ruled it satisfied the requirements of section 7-242.5.\r\n\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Forensics Lab Determination\r\n\r\nThe written determination for the Forensics Lab \r\n  project was prepared by Rick Brookey, the facilities project manager for Greenville \r\n  County.Â  The entire determination is limited to a single paragraph, and reads:Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this project \r\n  (no detailed defined scope of work), it is the opinion of Public Services that \r\n  this project will best be served using the turn key/design build methodology.Â  \r\n  Also, due to the budget (already established &amp; approved) and having both, \r\n  contractor and architect as a team, this approach will give the project the \r\n  best opportunity to get the most value for the needed renovation for our budget.Â  \r\n  Having a team consisting of a contractor, architect and user groups, will be \r\n  the most feasible way to get a defined scope of work and succeed in accomplishing \r\n  the userâ€™s needs within the budget and time frame for this project.\r\n\r\nThe County argues this determination is sufficient \r\n  because it addressed the critical â€œissues related to time, money and quality.â€Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nBrookeyâ€™s written determination stands in stark \r\n  contrast to the determinations prepared by Seals and Hansley for the Roads 2000 \r\n  and 2001 projects.Â  The Forensics Lab determination merely sets forth three \r\n  conclusory statements that are unsupported by any factual grounds related to \r\n  the renovation project.Â  The determination does not discuss the disadvantages \r\n  of using the traditional competitive sealed bidding method for this project, \r\n  nor does it discuss the advantages of the design-build with any degree of specificity.Â  \r\n\r\nWe conclude that the Forensics Lab determination \r\n  fails to provide any reasoned basis for the decision to use design-build source \r\n  selection.Â  It does not provide sufficient detail to allow the County Council \r\n  and the public to make an intelligent review of the decision.Â  The trial court \r\n  was therefore correct in finding this determination inadequate under section \r\n  7-242.5.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Admissibility of Evidence Regarding the \r\n  Written Determinations\r\nSloan argues the trial court erred by allowing the \r\n  County to present evidence regarding the written determinations for the use \r\n  of the design-build method of source selection.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, the court heard testimony from Gerald \r\n  Seals and John Hansley, both of whom served as county administrators during \r\n  the time the construction contracts were awarded and were responsible for preparing \r\n  the written determinations required by section 7-236.Â  The focus of their testimony \r\n  moved from matters specific to the projects at issue in this case to areas of \r\n  general background information, drawing on the sum of their experience working \r\n  with government procurement.Â  Seals and Hansley described the factors they considered \r\n  in making the determinations that design-build should be used for the construction \r\n  projects. Â Their testimony extended beyond the confines of the text of \r\n  the written determinations they submitted to the County Council:Â  Seals and \r\n  Hansley also described their decision-making processâ€”how they arrived at these \r\n  determinationsâ€”at times walking the court through the steps they followed in \r\n  deciding that design-build was the best fit for these projects.Â  They discussed \r\n  some of the problems encountered when using the competitive sealed bidding process \r\n  in earlier projects and some of their past successes using the design-build \r\n  method.\r\nSloan argues, by allowing testimony beyond a narrow \r\n  inquiry related to the specific content of the written determinations, the trial \r\n  court permitted the County to supplement and bolster those determinations.Â  \r\n  As proof that this evidence was improperly admitted and should not have been \r\n  considered, Sloan points to portions of the trial courtâ€™s order where the court \r\n  apparently relies on this testimony in reaching its conclusion that the Roads \r\n  projects were properly justified by the written determinations.Â  Sloan cites \r\n  several examples in the trial courtâ€™s Roads 2001 and Roads 2000 orders: In the \r\n  â€œFactsâ€ section of the Roads 2001 order, the trial court specifically discussed \r\n  Sealsâ€™ and Hansleyâ€™s testimony regarding the Countyâ€™s â€œgreat successâ€ in using \r\n  the design-build method in earlier construction projects.Â  The court stated \r\n  that Hansley â€œconduct[ed] a thorough review of the projectâ€ in making his determination \r\n  to use the design-build method.Â  In the Roads 2000 order, the trial court reviewed \r\n  in its â€œFactsâ€ section Sealsâ€™ testimony recounting his positive past experience \r\n  using the design-build method.\r\n In support of his argument that the testimony \r\n  was improperly admitted, Sloan relies exclusively on two cases: Piedmont \r\n  Natural Gas Co., Inc. v. Hamm, 301 S.C. 50, 389 S.E.2d 655 (1990) andÂ  Parker \r\n  v. South Carolina Public Service Commission, 288 S.C. 304, 342 S.E.2d 403 \r\n  (1986).Â  We find this authority inapposite.\r\nBoth Piedmont Natural Gas and Parker \r\n  stand for the rule that after a case has been remanded by an appellate court, \r\n  a party cannot submit additional evidence unless the appellate court has given \r\n  leave to do so.Â  See Piedmont Natural Gas, 301 S.C. at 54, 389 \r\n  S.E.2d at 657 (holding the supreme courtâ€™s remand to the Public Service Commission \r\n  to â€œsubstantiate the recordâ€ was a direction to the Commission merely to review \r\n  the evidence which was already contained in the record, not to hold a new hearing \r\n  for the admission of additional evidence); Parker, 288 S.C. at 307, 342 \r\n  S.E.2d at 405 (finding the supreme courtâ€™s remand of an issue to the Public \r\n  Service Commission for â€œfurther considerationâ€ did not permit the Commission \r\n  to entertain additional evidence not already contained in the record).Â  The \r\n  rationale for this rule is straightforward: â€œno party may afford itself two \r\n  bites at the apple.â€Â  Parker, 288 S.C. at 307, 342 S.E.2d at 405.\r\nThe present case does not concern the \r\n  admission of additional evidence upon remand from an appeal.Â  Quite the contrary, \r\n  the question before us is whether the trial court overstepped its authority \r\n  by entertaining evidence at trialâ€”the partiesâ€™ â€œfirst biteâ€ at the apple.Â  \r\nWe find the evidence admitted was material \r\n  and probative to the trial courtâ€™s inquiry into the sufficiency of the Countyâ€™s \r\n  written determination.Â  Part of the function of presenting evidence at trial \r\n  is to educate the finder of fact as to the surrounding circumstances giving \r\n  rise to the narrow issues raised.Â  There is no question that there was much \r\n  that was outside the expectable realm of knowledge of the trial court judge.Â  \r\n  Government procurement and its guiding policies are unfamiliar territory to \r\n  all but a few.Â  Collateral or background information presented by way of testimonial, \r\n  documentary, and demonstrative evidence would be necessary to fill in the gaps \r\n  of understanding.Â  This type of information is an important part of the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s process of educating itself: â€œIn addition to evidence that bears directly \r\n  on the issues, leeway is allowed even on direct examination for proof of facts \r\n  that merely fill in the background of the narrative and give it interest, color, \r\n  and lifelikeness.â€Â  1 McCormick on Evidence Â§ 185 (5th ed. 1999).\r\n We conclude the trial court did not err \r\n  in admitting the complete testimony of Seals and Hansley. \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Roads 2000 Bonding\r\nThe County argues the trial court erred \r\n  in ruling the County failed to obtain the appropriate payment and performance \r\n  bonds for the Roads 2000 project.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 7-238 of the County Code provides \r\n  â€œ[w]hen a construction contract is awarded in excess of twenty-five thousand \r\n  dollars ($25,000.00)â€ a â€œperformance bondâ€ and a â€œpayment bondâ€ â€œshall be delivered \r\n  to the county and shall become binding on the parties upon the execution of \r\n  the contract.â€Â  Each of these bonds â€œshall be in an amount equal to one hundred \r\n  (100) percent of the price specified in the contract.â€Â  G.C.C. Â§ 7-238.\r\nThe total amount of compensation agreed \r\n  upon under the contract for the Roads 2000 project was $6,759,100.Â  The County, \r\n  however, obtained a bond for only $4,666,000, the amount listed as the â€œtotal \r\n  construction budgetâ€ in an exhibit attached to the contract. Â The additional \r\n  $2,093,100 covered the costs for engineering ($816,900), â€œquality assuranceâ€ \r\n  ($201,200), and â€œprogram managementâ€ ($1,075,000).\r\nThe County asserts the â€œprice specified \r\n  in the contractâ€ under section 7-238 need not include items in the contract \r\n  other than the actual, direct costs of construction.Â  We find this argument \r\n  is in error.\r\nWe look first to the language of the Code \r\n  provision.Â  The words of a statute or regulation â€œmust be given their plain \r\n  and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit \r\n  or expand its operation.â€ Â Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 \r\n  S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992); accord Durham v. United \r\n  Cos. Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 604, 503 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1998); Adkins \r\n  v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 411, 475 S.E.2d 762, 763 (1996).Â  \r\n  â€œThe language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject \r\n  matter and accords with its general purpose.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys., 309 \r\n  S.C. at 178, 420 S.E.2d at 846 (citations omitted). Â A statute should be given \r\n  a reasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy \r\n  expressed in the statute.Â  Davis v. NationsCredit Fin. Servs. Corp., \r\n  326 S.C. 83, 484 S.E.2d 471 (1997); Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. \r\n  County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 22, 579 S.E.2d 334, 336 (Ct. App. 2003); Stephen \r\n  v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  If a \r\n  statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning â€œthe rules \r\n  of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose \r\n  another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, \r\n  581 (2000); Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d \r\n  890 (1995); Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, 354 S.C. at 24, 579 S.E.2d at \r\n  337.Â  \r\nBy its plain meaning, section 7-238 affords \r\n  the County no discretion to deliver payment and performance bonds for any amount \r\n  less than the amount specified in the contract.Â  There is no limiting language \r\n  which would indicate the provision was intended to apply only to the portion \r\n  of the contract price specifically related to the cost of construction.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Countyâ€™s procurement code is remedial in nature, \r\n  and its provisions should be construed liberally to carry out its purposes.Â  \r\n  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health v. Hanna, 270 S.C. 210, \r\n  213, 241 S.E.2d 563, 564 (1978) (â€œA remedial statute should be liberally construed \r\n  in order to effectuate its purpose.â€); Spencer v. Barnwell County Hosp., \r\n  314 S.C. 405, 408, 444 S.E.2d 538, 540 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œIn considering a remedial \r\n  act designed to protect a class of persons or the public at large, the courts \r\n  liberally construe the act to carry out its purposes.â€).Â  Because the express \r\n  purpose of the procurement code is to ensure the â€œefficient and economical use \r\n  of revenuesâ€ provided by the taxpayers (Â§ 7-192), the bonding requirements of \r\n  section 7-238 should be read to afford the greatest protection to the citizens \r\n  of Greenville County.\r\nWe are bolstered in our reading of section \r\n  7-238 by evidence presented at trial regarding the general industry practice \r\n  concerning the delivery of performance and payment bonds.Â  Included in the record \r\n  before the court is an industry publication, Design-Build RFQ/RFP Guide for \r\n  Public Sector Projects.Â  Under the heading â€œContract Bond Must Include Design,â€ \r\n  this guide instructs the government procurer to:\r\n\r\nIndicate to the proposers that \r\n  the contract bond (performance and payment bond) must cover the entire contract \r\n  between the owner and the design-builder, including any and all necessary professional \r\n  architectural and engineering services.Â  The bond must not be limited to construction \r\n  value and associated risks.\r\n\r\nExpert testimony was also presented which confirms \r\n  that the general practice in the field of public procurement is to obtain bonds \r\n  for the full amount of the contract price, inclusive of design and other non-construction \r\n  cost items.\r\nWe conclude the language of section \r\n  7-238, supported by evidence regarding industry practice, clearly requires the \r\n  delivery of performance and payment bonds for the full amount of the contract \r\n  price, not simply the contract costs for construction alone.Â  The trial court, \r\n  therefore, correctly ruled the Roads 2000 project was not properly bonded. \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Sufficiency of Forensics Lab Contract\r\nSloan argues the Forensics Lab contract fails to \r\n  comply with section 7-240(a) of the County Code because the County failed to \r\n  append the contract with a project scope, payment schedule, or project schedule.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nSection 7-240 provides: â€œAll contracts for . . \r\n  . construction shall include provisions necessary to define the responsibilities \r\n  and rights of the parties to the contract.â€Â  Based on our review of the contract, \r\n  we find this standard was met.Â  Although no additional documents were attached \r\n  to the original contract further defining the project scope, payment schedule, \r\n  or project schedule, the contract was sufficiently definite to â€œdefine the responsibilities \r\n  and rights of the parties to the contract.â€\r\nWith respect to the project scope, construction \r\n  drawings were developed for the project, reflecting in substantial detail the \r\n  project scope contemplated by the design-build team.Â  The contract also incorporated \r\n  by reference the Request for Proposal criteria used to solicit design-build \r\n  team proposals, providing a further indication of the planned project scope.\r\nThe contract also contains sufficient details regarding \r\n  compensation and terms of payment.Â  Article 3.1 provides that the price of the \r\n  contract shall not exceed $290,000.Â  Additionally, Article 4.1 addresses the \r\n  terms of paymentâ€”outlining in substantial detail when the contractor is required \r\n  to submit payments each month and the timeframe in which the County must make \r\n  payments.\r\nFinally, while the contract does not provide a \r\n  comprehensive project schedule, it does contain a 120-day completion schedule. \r\n  Â We conclude, therefore, that the contract is sufficiently definite to \r\n  â€œdefine the responsibilities and rights of the parties.â€ \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court \r\n  ruled correctly with respect to all of the issues presented:Â  The case was properly \r\n  justiciable.Â  The written determinations to use design-build source selection \r\n  for the Roads 2000 and Roads 2001 projects were sufficient under the Code, while \r\n  the determination prepared for the Forensics Lab project was not.Â  The trial \r\n  court did not err by admitting witness testimony regarding the written determinations.Â  \r\n  The County did not obtain sufficient performance and payment bonds for the Roads \r\n  2000 project.Â  Finally, the trial court correctly found the Forensics Lab contract \r\n  was sufficient under the Code.Â  Accordingly, the rulings of the trial court \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Professionals in the field of public procurement variously refer \r\n    to this method of source selection as â€œdesign-build,â€ â€œcompetitive sealed \r\n    proposal,â€ or â€œrequest for proposal.â€Â  Though these terms are generally interchangeable, \r\n    for ease of reference, we will refer exclusively to â€œdesign-buildâ€ when discussing \r\n    this alternative to traditional competitive sealed bidding procurement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t

Thompson brought this \r\n  action seeking compensation for property condemned by the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Transportation (SCDOT).Â  Thompson received a jury award of $38,000.Â  The \r\n  trial court awarded Thompson attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 28-2-510(B) (1991), finding she was the prevailing party as required \r\n  by the statute.Â  SCDOT appeals.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nSCDOT condemned a portion of Thompsonâ€™s \r\n  property in Horry County in order to construct the Conway Bypass.Â  Prior to \r\n  the condemnation, Thompson owned 10.04 acres.Â  As a result of the condemnation \r\n  of 3.35 acres, Thompsonâ€™s land was split into two tracts totaling 6.69 acres.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, SCDOT presented testimony that \r\n  the value of the condemned land was only $6,821.Â  That value was much less than \r\n  the value given by Thompsonâ€™s appraiser, who testified the property was worth \r\n  $33,500.Â  Thompson testified that she believed the property was worth $8,000 \r\n  per acre and that the remaining 6.69 acres were damaged by either 50 or 60 per \r\n  cent.Â  The highest resulting compensation would therefore be $58,912. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nDuring cross-examination, SCDOTâ€™s counsel \r\n  asked Thompson about a statement in her deposition regarding the value of the \r\n  property.Â  Thompson admitted that during her deposition testimony she had stated \r\n  the property was worth $15,000 to $20,000 per acre, instead of the $8,000 she \r\n  testified to at trial.Â  This would have produced a high valuation of $147,280, \r\n  using $20,000 per acre and additionally assuming the damage to the remainder \r\n  of the land was 60 per cent.\r\nAt trial, however, Thompson asserted that \r\n  the value was only $8,000 per acre.Â  She explained, â€œItâ€™s Eight Thousand, because \r\n  at that time I was really upset . . . about the taking of my land, and the way \r\n  it was left, and Iâ€™ve had time to think about it, and Iâ€™ve gone back down and \r\n  looked at it a lot more, and I think, to be fair and reasonable, Eight Thousand \r\n  is better.â€Â  \r\nAfter the jury returned a verdict for \r\n  Thompson for $38,000 in total compensation, the trial court found she was the \r\n  prevailing party and awarded her litigation expenses of $13,159.36.Â  The court \r\n  reasoned the verdict was closer to Thompsonâ€™s value attested to at trial of \r\n  $8,000 per acre (plus the damage to the remainder at 50 to 60 per cent) than \r\n  SCDOTâ€™s highest valuation of $6,821 in total compensation.Â  Moreover, the court \r\n  found Thompson had expressly disavowed the value she had placed on the property \r\n  in her deposition testimony; therefore, it was not the highest value attested \r\n  to at trial by Thompson.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Value in Deposition Testimony\r\nSCDOT contends the trial court erred in \r\n  finding Thompson was entitled to litigation expenses as the prevailing party.Â  \r\n  Specifically, SCDOT maintains the highest value attested to by Thompson was \r\n  the amount stated in her deposition, $15,000 to $20,000 per acre, which would \r\n  have given a high valuation of $147,280, thus making SCDOTâ€™s valuation of $6,821 \r\n  closer to the actual jury verdict of $38,000. [3] Â  We disagree.\r\n After a condemnation action is concluded, \r\n  the landowner may petition for litigation expenses pursuant to section 28-2-510(B)(1), \r\n  which provides:Â  â€œA landowner who prevails in the trial of a condemnation action, \r\n  in addition to his compensation for the property, may recover his reasonable \r\n  litigation expenses . . . .â€ [4] Â  \r\nThe statute defines â€œprevailsâ€ as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this section, â€œprevailsâ€ means that the \r\n  compensation awarded (other than by settlement) for the property, exclusive \r\n  of interest, is at least as close to the highest valuation of the property that \r\n  is attested to at trial on behalf of the landowner as it is to the highest \r\n  valuation of the property that is attested to at trial on behalf of the \r\n  condemnor. [5] \r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has further defined \r\n  the meaning of â€œprevailsâ€ in the case of City of Folly Beach v. Atlantic \r\n  House Properties, Ltd., stating â€œa landowner â€˜prevailsâ€™ if the difference \r\n  between the value he offers at trial and the compensation awarded him is less \r\n  than or equal to the difference between the value the condemnor offers at trial \r\n  and the compensation awarded landowner.â€ [6] \r\nThe central issue in this case turns on \r\n  whether the value placed on the property in Thompsonâ€™s deposition was ever â€œattested \r\n  to at trialâ€ by Thompson.Â  We conclude the higher value of $15,000 to $20,000 \r\n  per acre was not â€œattested to at trialâ€ on behalf of the landowner as required \r\n  by the statute.\r\nSCDOT offered the testimony regarding \r\n  the $15,000 to $20,000 per acre valuation in an attempt to discredit the testimony \r\n  of Thompson.Â  Thompson did not offer the deposition testimony as a reasonable \r\n  value for compensation for the condemned property.Â  Thompson unequivocally and \r\n  expressly testified that the value she was utilizing at trial was $8,000 per \r\n  acre and that the value she testified to in her deposition was not accurate \r\n  and was the result of her emotions.Â  Based upon the wording of the statute, \r\n  we hold Thompson only attested to the $8,000 per acre value at trial and that \r\n  is the amount to be used in determining whether she was the prevailing party \r\n  so as to entitle her to litigation expenses. \r\nII.Â  Reference to Value in Closing \r\n  Argument\r\nSCDOT further contends that Thompsonâ€™s attorney \r\n  used the higher valuation in his closing argument and therefore it should be \r\n  used in determining whether Thompson was the prevailing party. \r\n  [7] Â  We disagree.\r\nArguments made by counsel are not evidence. \r\n  [8] Â  Additionally, the statements clearly do not constitute an attestation \r\n  at trial as required by the statute.Â  Thus, this issue provides no basis for \r\n  reversing the award of litigation expenses to Thompson. \r\n  [9] \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  This sum is calculated as follows:Â  (3.35 condemned acres x $8,000 \r\n    per acre) + (6.69 remaining acres x 60 per cent damage x $8,000 per acre).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  In the order awarding Thompson litigation expenses as the prevailing \r\n    party, the trial court incorrectly stated the highest value attested to at \r\n    trial by Thompson was $48,192 instead of $58,912.Â  Even when the correct figure \r\n    is used, however, the juryâ€™s verdict was closer to the value testified to \r\n    by Thompson than the value asserted by SCDOT. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  S.C.

Dana Sinkler, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Trident Medical Center (Trident) appeals the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s finding that the agreement between Trident and James C. Thornton does \r\n  not involve interstate commerce and, therefore, is not subject to the Federal \r\n  Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 2 (1999).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1999, Trident was suffering from a shortage of qualified physicians in its \r\n  cardiovascular surgery group, South Carolina Cardiovascular Associates (â€œSCCAâ€).Â  \r\n  To alleviate this shortage, Trident began an effort to recruit physicians from \r\n  other parts of the country to join SCCA.Â  To entice physicians to move to Charleston, \r\n  Trident offered substantial financial incentives that would not only cover the \r\n  expenses of relocation but would provide bonuses and a guaranteed income stream \r\n  for a period of time after their arrival.\r\nDr. James Thornton (Thornton) was one of the physicians Trident was able to \r\n  attract to Charleston.Â  In May 1999, Thornton and Trident entered into a â€œrecruiting \r\n  agreementâ€ in which Thornton agreed to relocate his medical practice as a cardiovascular \r\n  surgeon from Grand Rapids, Michigan to Charleston.Â  In addition to the principal \r\n  agreement under which Thornton agreed to relocate to Charleston and maintain \r\n  his practice there for at least four years, the recruiting agreement contained \r\n  four addenda: (1) a net collectable revenue guarantee which provided Thornton \r\n  with a guaranteed income for twenty-four months; (2) a signing bonus; (3) a \r\n  relocation agreement for payment of moving expenses; and (4) an agreement providing \r\n  that Thornton was being recruited into the existing practice of SCCA.\r\nPayment of all the financial incentives to Thornton under this agreement was \r\n  contingent upon Thornton maintaining his practice in Charleston for at least \r\n  four years.Â  If he failed to do so, the payments made to Thornton under the \r\n  agreement had to be repaid to Trident.Â  Further, the agreement read: â€œIn the \r\n  event any dispute shall arise concerning any aspect of this Agreement, such \r\n  dispute shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with \r\n  rules established by the American Arbitration Association.â€\r\nThornton moved to Charleston and joined SCCA in August 1999.Â  However, he left \r\n  the practice and relocated to Pennsylvania before the end of his four-year commitment.Â  \r\n  Thornton claimed he was excused from his obligations under the recruiting agreement \r\n  and refused to repay any of the financial incentives he had received from Trident.\r\nThornton brought the present declaratory judgment action seeking a determination \r\n  that the arbitration provision contained in the recruiting agreement was unenforceable.Â  \r\n  The trial court found the provision (1) did not satisfy the requirements set \r\n  out in Â§ 15-48-10 of the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act, and (2) was \r\n  not enforceable under Â§ 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (â€œFAAâ€), because the \r\n  transaction between the parties did not involve interstate commerce.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeterminations of arbitrability are subject to de novo review.Â  Stokes v. \r\n  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 571 S.E.2d 711 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  Nevertheless, a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal \r\n  if there is any evidence reasonably supporting the findings.Â  McMillan v. \r\n  Gold Kist, Inc., 353 S.C. 353, 577 S.E.2d 482 (Ct. App. 2003); Evans \r\n  v. Accent Manufactured Homes, Inc., 352 S.C. 544, 575 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003); Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 521 S.E.2d 749 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for \r\n  judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.Â  Zabinski v. \r\n  Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 553 S.E.2d 110 (2001); Evans, \r\n  352 S.C. at 549, 575 S.E.2d at 76; see also Vestry and Church Wardens \r\n  v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Op. No. 3679 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September \r\n  22, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 35 at 53) (whether claim is subject to arbitration \r\n  is issue for judicial determination, unless parties have agreed otherwise).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe parties do not dispute the trial courtâ€™s finding that the arbitration clause \r\n  contained in the recruiting agreement is unenforceable under the South Carolina \r\n  Uniform Arbitration Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-48-10 to -240 (Supp. 2002).Â  If, \r\n  however, the agreement involves interstate commerce, the FAA applies and trumps \r\n  the state arbitration laws.Â  See Doctorâ€™s Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto, \r\n  517 U.S. 681 (1996); Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc., 323 \r\n  S.C. 454, 476 S.E.2d 149 (1996).\r\nThe FAA provides: â€œA written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract \r\n  evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy \r\n  thereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and \r\n  enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation \r\n  of any contract.â€Â  9 U.S.C. Â§ 2.Â  The words â€œinvolving commerceâ€ have been interpreted \r\n  by the United States Supreme Court as being the functional equivalent of â€œaffecting \r\n  commerceâ€â€”words signaling â€œan intent to exercise Congressâ€™ commerce power to \r\n  the full.â€Â  Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 277 (1995); \r\n  see also Citizens Bank v. Alafabco, Inc., 123 S. Ct. 2037, 2040 \r\n  (2003) (â€œWe have interpreted the term â€˜involving commerceâ€™ in the FAA as the \r\n  functional equivalent of the more familiar term â€˜affecting commerceâ€™â€”words of \r\n  art that ordinarily signal the broadest permissible exercise of Congressâ€™ Commerce \r\n  Clause power.â€); Blanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 540, 570 S.E.2d 565, \r\n  568 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œThe United States Supreme Court has held that the phrase \r\n  â€˜involving commerceâ€™ is the same as â€˜affecting commerce,â€™ which has been broadly \r\n  interpreted to mean Congress intended to utilize its powers to regulate interstate \r\n  commerce to its full extent.â€).Â  â€œBecause the statute provides for the enforcement \r\n  of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause, it is \r\n  perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider range of transactions than \r\n  those actually in commerceâ€”that is, within the flow of interstate commerce.â€Â  \r\n  Citizens Bank, 123 S. Ct. at 2040 (internal quotation marks and citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nThornton claims the recruiting agreement does not evidence interstate commerce \r\n  and, consequently, the FAA does not apply.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn all cases, determination of whether a transaction involves interstate commerce \r\n  depends on the facts of the case.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., \r\n  346 S.C. 580, 594, 553 S.E.2d 110, 117 (2001) (â€œTo ascertain whether a transaction \r\n  involves commerce within the meaning of the FAA, the court must examine the \r\n  agreement, the complaint, and the surrounding facts.â€).Â  Thornton argues the \r\n  recruiting agreement did not involve interstate commerce because it only concerned \r\n  the performance of his duties as a physician providing medical services within \r\n  South Carolina.\r\nThornton is correct in urging this Court to focus upon what the terms of the \r\n  contract specifically require for performance in determining whether interstate \r\n  commerce is involved.Â  Our courts consistently look to the essential character \r\n  of the contract when applying the FAA.\r\nIn Mathews v. Fluor Corp., our Supreme Court found interstate commerce \r\n  was not involved in a contract for the sale of land in South Carolina to out-of-state \r\n  partiesâ€”even though, incident to the sale, the parties obtained the services \r\n  of a North Carolina engineer and financing from a Pennsylvania lender.Â  Mathews \r\n  v. Fluor Corp., 312 S.C. 404, 440 S.E.2d 880 (1994), overruled by \r\n  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 542 S.E.2d 360 (2001) (overruling \r\n  Mathews â€œto the extent it considered whether the parties contemplated \r\n  interstate commerce as a factor in determining if the FAA applied.â€).Â  The Court \r\n  held the transaction was outside the scope of the FAA because it was â€œunable \r\n  to discern from the evidence presented whether the contract required \r\n  respondent to administer anything related to interstate commerce.â€Â  Mathews, \r\n  312 S.C. at 407, 440 S.E.2d at 882 (emphasis in original).Â  See also \r\n  Munoz v.

Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 541, 570 S.E.2d 565, 569 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002) (determining that a contract for design and architectural services \r\n  in the construction of a restaurant in South Carolina involved interstate commerce \r\n  because â€œâ€˜the contract not only contemplated the use of materials manufactured \r\n  outside the state of South Carolina, but realistically the project could not \r\n  be constructed without the use of materials in interstate commerce.â€™â€).\r\nIn the present case, performance of the recruiting agreement requires activity \r\n  involving interstate commerce.Â  Contrary to Thorntonâ€™s assertions, the subject \r\n  matter of the contract clearly extends beyond Thorntonâ€™s obligation to provide \r\n  medical services in South Carolina.Â  Thornton was recruited and agreed to move \r\n  from one state to another.Â  An essential requirement for performance under the \r\n  agreement was Thorntonâ€™s relocation from Michigan to South Carolina within a \r\n  fixed period of time.Â  Thornton was a resident of Michigan at the time the contract \r\n  was entered.Â  The contract recites that Thornton will be compensated for expenses \r\n  incurred in moving his personal effects and household furnishings to South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Thornton accepted money to defray the cost of the move and agreed to repay these \r\n  relocation expenses if he failed to maintain his practice in Charleston for \r\n  four years.Â  The contract terms provided for Tridentâ€™s payment of money to induce \r\n  the relocation and Thorntonâ€™s promise to repay the money should he fail to perform \r\n  fully under the contract.Â  By the terms of the recruiting agreement, Thornton \r\n  was obligated to relocate his practice from Michigan to South Carolina.Â  Trident, \r\n  in turn, was obligated to reimburse Thornton for expenses incurred in the transfer \r\n  of his practice across state lines.Â  After Thorntonâ€™s relocation to South Carolina, \r\n  he was then bound by the terms of the agreement to remain in the state as a \r\n  practicing physician for at least four years, effectively preventing him from \r\n  working in any other state during that time.Â  The contract was denominated as \r\n  and was intended as a recruiting agreement to induce Thorntonâ€™s move across \r\n  state lines.Â  The express purpose of the recruiting agreement was to provide \r\n  a monetary incentive, consisting of multiple related promises, to induce Thornton \r\n  to relocate his professional medical services practice from Michigan to South \r\n  Carolina.\r\nThornton contends the present case is analogous to and controlled by the United \r\n  States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., 350 \r\n  U.S. 198 (1956).Â  We disagree.Â  First, we note that Bernhardt was decided \r\n  over forty-five years ago.Â  The law of arbitrability was nascent in 1956 and \r\n  has evolved and maturated extant.Â  Moreover, Bernhardt differs factually \r\n  from the instant case.Â  In Bernhardt, plaintiff sought to invoke the \r\n  arbitration act with respect to an employment contract entered into in New York, \r\n  but which was to be performed in Vermont.Â  Id. at 199.Â  The Court held \r\n  that the FAA did not apply because the contract did not evidence â€œâ€˜a transaction \r\n  involving commerce.â€™â€Â  Id. at 200.Â  The Courtâ€™s finding was based upon \r\n  the absence of any proof demonstrating that plaintiff â€œwhile performing his \r\n  duties under the employment contract was working â€˜inâ€™ commerce, was producing \r\n  goods for commerce, or was engaging in activity that affected commerce.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 201.\r\nUnlike the recruiting agreement \r\n  in the case sub judice, the agreement in Bernhardt did \r\n  not contemplate any actions affecting commerce outside of Vermont.Â  Performance \r\n  under the contract in Bernhardt wasâ€”by its termsâ€”confined to a single \r\n  state.\r\nThe case of Selma \r\n  Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Fontenot, 824 So. 2d 668 (Ala. 2001), is instructive.Â  \r\n  The contract at issue in Selma (1) required two physicians to relocate \r\n  their medical practices from one state to another; (2) provided guaranteed gross \r\n  receipts or income for a certain period of time after relocation, with the stipulation \r\n  that if the net collectible revenue exceeded $500,000 during that period, the \r\n  physicians would repay the hospital the difference; (3) provided for payment \r\n  of certain sums to assist in relocation expenses and start-up costs; and (4) \r\n  contained a provision requiring arbitration in accordance with the rules of \r\n  the American Arbitration Association.Â  The similitude of the contract in Selma \r\n  and the contract in the present case is striking.\r\nA dispute arose when \r\n  the hospital claimed, but the physicians disputed, that the physicians owed \r\n  the hospital excess revenue collected during the guarantee period.Â  Concordant \r\n  with Thornton, the Alabama physicians challenged the arbitration agreement and \r\n  attempted to have the court disregard the clear interstate aspect of the agreement \r\n  and concentrate solely on medical services to be provided in-state.Â  South Carolina \r\n  and Alabama each have a statute that places certain requirements on arbitration \r\n  agreements if they are to be enforced.Â  Thus, like the case at bar, if the FAA \r\n  applied, Alabamaâ€™s statutory requirement for arbitration agreements would be \r\n  preempted.\r\nIn determining that the arbitration \r\n  provisions contained within the physician recruitment agreements were governed \r\n  by the FAA, the Selma court cited the three categories of activity that \r\n  Congress can regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause, namely: â€œ(1) the use \r\n  of the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate \r\n  commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) those activities \r\n  having a substantial effect on interstate commerce.â€Â  Id. at 674 (emphasis \r\n  in original).Â  The court concluded that, in the context of the physician recruitment \r\n  agreement at issue in Selma, interstate commerce was involved because \r\n  â€œthe actual persons and things involved are themselves within the flow of commerce.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 674 (internal quotations omitted).Â  The court explained:\r\n\r\nThe Physicians entered the flow of interstate commerce when they moved from \r\n  South Carolina to Alabama.Â  In fact, the sole purpose of the Agreements was \r\n  to place the Physicians within the current of commerce and to move them to Alabama \r\n  . . . . Accordingly, when the Physicians moved across state lines, they became \r\n  â€œpersons . . . in interstate commerce.â€Â  As part of the flow of commerce, then, \r\n  the Physicians were properly subject to congressional regulation.\r\nThe flow of commerce begins before, and ends after, the actual movement across \r\n  State lines, in order to fulfill the purpose of the overall transaction. . . \r\n  . .\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nThe Agreements required the Physicians to move themselves and their medical \r\n  practices from South Carolina to Selma, Alabama, to provide anesthesia services \r\n  to patients in the Selma community.Â  Thus, the agreements were themselves an \r\n  integral part of the Physiciansâ€™ movement in the flow of commerce, subjecting \r\n  their personal-service contracts to the jurisdiction of the FAA.\r\n\r\nId. at 675 (citations omitted).\r\nHaving determined the \r\n  physicians were part of the flow of interstate commerce, the Selma court \r\n  did not need to decide whether the physician recruitment agreements substantially \r\n  affected commerce.Â  â€œWhen a case involves allegations of the use of the instrumentalities \r\n  of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, a court \r\n  need not reach the question whether the underlying transaction â€˜substantially \r\n  affectsâ€™ interstate commerce, because such persons and things, by definition, \r\n  substantially affectâ€”because they are components ofâ€”interstate commerce.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 674 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nThe Selma courtâ€™s \r\n  logic and analysis apply equally here and are in full accord with South Carolina \r\n  case law.Â  Irrefutably, there is a substantial impact on interstate commerce: \r\n  (1) money was paid and is now owed as a result of recruiting across state lines; \r\n  (2) factually, the record is replete with movement across state lines; and (3) \r\n  negotiation, bargaining, and completion of an agreement was within the rubric \r\n  of interstate commerce.Â  The reach of the FAA, as explicated by the Commerce \r\n  Clause, encapsulates the Trident-Thornton contract.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the recruiting agreement entered into \r\n  between Thornton and Trident involved interstate commerce.Â  Concomitantly, the \r\n  FAA governs the agreement in this case and compels arbitration.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the trial court is\r\n REVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3707","title":"Williamsburg Rural Water v.

Reddeck, of Lake City; for Appellant.\r\nErnest J. Jarrett, W.E. Jenkinson, \r\n  III, and Jennifer R. Kellahan, all of Kingstree; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  The central issue \r\n  in this case is whether a countyâ€™s constructive approval of a water and sewer \r\n  service proposal submitted by a non-profit corporation under former S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 33-35-90 grants the non-profit corporation exclusive service rights such \r\n  that the county may not give franchise rights to competing providers within \r\n  the same service areas designated in the proposal.Â  Williamsburg Rural Water \r\n  and Sewer Company, Inc. (Williamsburg Water) commenced this action against Williamsburg \r\n  County, Williamsburg County Water and Sewer Authority, and the Town of Kingstree \r\n  (collectively, the County) [1]  \r\n  seeking: (1) a determination that Williamsburg Water possessed an exclusive \r\n  right to provide water and sewer service within designated unincorporated areas \r\n  in Williamsburg County, (2) damages in tort based on the Countyâ€™s interference \r\n  with that right, and (3) injunctive relief.Â  The circuit court granted summary \r\n  judgment to the County, finding that Williamsburg Water did not possess an exclusive \r\n  service right and that Williamsburg Waterâ€™s cause of action in tort was barred \r\n  by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the statute of limitations.Â  Williamsburg \r\n  Water appeals. We affirm.\r\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe relevant facts of this \r\n  case are largely undisputed and are gathered from a timeline of events to which \r\n  the parties stipulated.Â  On January 16, 1995, W.N. Kellahan, an organizer of \r\n  Williamsburg Water, sent a letter to Elwood Gerald, the Countyâ€™s director of \r\n  rural and community development, notifying the County of Williamsburg Waterâ€™s \r\n  intention to provide service to certain unincorporated areas of Williamsburg \r\n  County pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-35-90 (1990).  \r\n  [2]  Â Â Section 33-35-90 sets forth the statutory mechanism for a non-profit \r\n  corporation to provide water and sewer services within the geographical areas \r\n  designated in its articles of incorporation, provided the corporation notifies \r\n  the county of the nature of the services to be provided and receives the countyâ€™s \r\n  consent.\r\nIn March and again in April of 1995, Kellahan appeared \r\n  before the Williamsburg County Council on behalf of Williamsburg Water to reiterate \r\n  Williamsburg Waterâ€™s intent to provide services to the designated areas.Â  Kellahan \r\n  sent a copy of Williamsburg Waterâ€™s master plan to the council and to Gerald.Â  \r\n  In May of 1995, Williamsburg Water filed its articles of incorporation with \r\n  the Secretary of State.Â  Shortly thereafter, Williamsburg Water began applying \r\n  for loans and federal grants to fund its operation.\r\nDuring this same time period, the county council began \r\n  considering enacting an ordinance that would allow the County to expand its \r\n  own water and sewer services into the same unincorporated areas that Williamsburg \r\n  Water intended to service.Â  The proposed ordinance allowed the County to grant \r\n  franchises to organizations that submitted applications to the County seeking \r\n  permission to provide service within these same areas.\r\nThe first of three public readings of \r\n  the proposed franchise ordinance was held on March 6, 1995.Â  On August 7 of \r\n  that year, the ordinance was adopted.Â  In May of 1998, the County applied for \r\n  federal funding to construct its water system.Â  On November 3, 1998, the County \r\n  solicited bids for water and sewer services to the Industrial Park area, which \r\n  is located within the service area designated in Williamsburg Waterâ€™s proposal.Â  \r\n  The County awarded the bid to Tom Brigman Contractorâ€™s, Inc., of Newberry, on \r\n  November 9, 1998. \r\nIn response, Williamsburg Water commenced \r\n  this action against the County on December 4, 1998, claiming that Williamsburg \r\n  Water possessed an exclusive right to provide services to the unincorporated \r\n  areas specified in its proposal, including the area where the Industrial Park \r\n  was located. In essence, Williamsburg Water claimed that its proposal was approved \r\n  by the County by virtue of the Countyâ€™s failure to notify Williamsburg Water \r\n  to the contrary in accordance with section 33-35-90. Williamsburg Water further \r\n  claimed the County intentionally interfered with and/or threatened to interfere \r\n  with Williamsburg Waterâ€™s ability to obtain federal funding and to provide service \r\n  within the designated areas.Â  The complaint alleged that as a result of the \r\n  Countyâ€™s grossly negligent actions, Williamsburg Water suffered injury and damages.Â  \r\n  Finally, Williamsburg Water sought a declaration that it was exempt from the \r\n  Countyâ€™s franchise ordinance and that it possessed an exclusive right to service \r\n  the unincorporated areas designated in its proposal. \r\nÂ Williamsburg Water and the County filed cross \r\n  motions for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to \r\n  the County on Williamsburg Waterâ€™s first cause of action, ruling that Williamsburg \r\n  Water had the right, but not the exclusive right, to provide water and sewer \r\n  service to the designated areas.Â  The circuit court also granted summary judgment \r\n  to the County on Williamsburg Waterâ€™s action in tort, finding the County was \r\n  immune from liability under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and that the \r\n  statute of limitations had run.Â  However, the circuit court found there was \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Williamsburg Water was exempt \r\n  from the Countyâ€™s franchise ordinance.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate \r\n  court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567, S.E.2d 857, \r\n  860 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden \r\n  of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the non-moving \r\n  party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue \r\n  for trial.Â  Id.; SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 497, \r\n  392 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1990).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact \r\n  exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Worsley \r\n  Cos.Â  v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 339 S.C. 51, 55, 528 S.E.2d 657, 659 (2000).Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Exclusive Service \r\n  Rights\r\nThe circuit court found that the notices contained in Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s proposal dated January 16, 1995, were both proper and adequate to comply \r\n  with section 33-35-90.Â  Moreover, the circuit court held Williamsburg Water \r\n  possessed the right, but not the exclusive right, to provide service within \r\n  the disputed area.Â  The County did not appeal either of these findings; therefore, \r\n  it is the law of this case that Williamsburg Water possesses a right to provide \r\n  water and sewer services in Williamsburg County.Â  See Bakala v. Bakala, \r\n  352 S.C. 612, 576 S.E.2d 156 (2003); Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing \r\n  Corp., 338 S.E. 171, 525 S.E.2d 869 (2000) (stating an unappealed ruling \r\n  is the law of the case). The question before this court is whether that right \r\n  is an exclusive service right, such that the County is prohibited from awarding \r\n  franchises within the areas identified in Williamsburg Waterâ€™s proposal.Â  \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s order does not indicate the basis for \r\n  its finding that Williamsburg Water possesses a right to provide service in \r\n  the county.Â  We presume the circuit court found this right to be the product \r\n  of the Countyâ€™s failure to comply with the mandatory notice provisions of section \r\n  33-35-90, for there is no other explanation in the order for the creation of \r\n  this right.Â  It is the law of this case that Williamsburg Water possesses a \r\n  right of some degree; thus, determining the source of that right is not necessary \r\n  to its existence.Â  However, we believe it is necessary for a complete understanding \r\n  of the controversy in this case to briefly set forth our view regarding the \r\n  Countyâ€™s failure to comply with section 33-35-90, which must be the foundation \r\n  for the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nSection 33-35-90 (1990) stated in relevant part:\r\n\r\n[P]rior to providing any of the services authorized in this \r\n  section, nonprofit corporations or groups intending to organize such corporations \r\n  shall first notify the governing body, of the county or municipality in which \r\n  the services are to be provided, of their intentions and the nature of such \r\n  services.Â  The governing body shall, from the date of such notification, \r\n  have a period of ninety days in which to approve the request to provide such \r\n  services or inform the persons requesting permission to provide such services \r\n  that the governing body intends to provide for such matters as a public function \r\n  of government.Â  Any such notification of intent by the governing body shall \r\n  include a detailed description of the area to be served, the services to be \r\n  provided and the time schedule under which such services will be available from \r\n  the county or municipality.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n  and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.â€ Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  \r\n  â€œUnless there is something in a statute requiring a different interpretation, \r\n  the words used in the statute must be given their ordinary meaning.â€Â  Mullinax \r\n  v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 326 S.C. 453, 458, 485 S.E.2d 103, 106 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  â€œThe language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with \r\n  its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys. \r\n  Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  â€œStatutes, \r\n  as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant \r\n  with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â  \r\n\r\nSection 33-35-90 unambiguously required the County to respond \r\n  to Williamsburg Waterâ€™s proposal within ninety days of its receipt.Â  The statute \r\n  further required the County to inform Williamsburg Water of its intention to \r\n  provide such services and to give a detailed description of any area it wished \r\n  to serve, as well as a time schedule for the availability of such services.Â  \r\n  Although the first reading of the proposed ordinance occurred within ninety \r\n  days of Williamsburg Waterâ€™s application, there is no evidence the reading of \r\n  the ordinance notified Williamsburg Water that the County had rejected its proposal \r\n  or that it described with detail the area it wished to service, the nature of \r\n  services to be provided, and the time schedule for the availability of such \r\n  services.Â  Section 33-35-90 mandates that â€œanyâ€ such notification by the County \r\n  â€œshallâ€ include such information. It is irrelevant that representatives of Williamsburg \r\n  Water attended the reading of the proposed ordinance because the reading did \r\n  not satisfy the requirements of the statute.Â  The County, therefore, failed \r\n  to comply with section 33-35-90.Â  \r\nUnlike current section 33-36-270, \r\n  [3]  the former statute does not specifically state that a governing bodyâ€™s \r\n  failure to respond to a non-profit corporationâ€™s proposal serves as an acceptance \r\n  of the corporationâ€™s proposal.Â  However, we believe the use of affirmative language \r\n  stating that the County â€œshall . . . have a period of ninety daysâ€ in \r\n  which to respond imposes an obligation upon the County to take action in accordance \r\n  with the statute.Â  See Horry County v. City of Myrtle Beach, 288 \r\n  S.C. 412, 419, 343 S.E.2d 36, 39 (Ct. App. 1986) (stating the words â€œshallâ€ \r\n  and â€œmustâ€ are generally regarded as making a provision mandatory).Â  Considering \r\n  its overall purpose and the mandatory terms chosen by the legislature, we believe \r\n  the only logical construction of section 33-35-90 is that the Countyâ€™s failure \r\n  to respond within the ninety-day time limit constitutes approval of Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s proposal. [4] Â  \r\nWe turn now to address the extent of the service rights acquired \r\n  by Williamsburg Water as a result of the Countyâ€™s implicit approval of the proposal.Â  \r\n  Williamsburg Water argues its right to provide water and sewer services is exclusive; \r\n  therefore, the County was prohibited from awarding franchises within the proposed \r\n  service area.Â  The County disagrees, contending that Section 15 of Article VIII \r\n  of the South Carolina Constitution safeguards the Countyâ€™s right to choose whomever \r\n  it desires to provide such services to its citizens.Â  \r\nSection 15 of Article VIII states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n [N]or shall any law be passed by the \r\n  General Assembly granting the right to construct and operate in a public \r\n  street or on public property a street or other railway, or to erect waterworks \r\n  for public use, or to lay water or sewer mains for any purpose, or to use the \r\n  streets for any facility other than telephone, telegraph, gas, and electric, \r\n  without first obtaining the consent of the governing body of the county \r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nSection 15 of Article VIII of the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution prohibits the legislature from passing a law which grants the right \r\n  to lay water or sewer mains without first obtaining a countyâ€™s consent.Â  See \r\n  City of Aiken v. Aiken Elec. Co-op., Inc., 305 S.C. 466, 468, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  403, 404 (1991).Â  However, section 15 conveys only a veto power; it is not a \r\n  franchising mechanism.Â  See City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. Co-op., \r\n  Inc., 287 S.C. 361, 368, 338 S.E.2d 831, 835 (1985) (â€œThe consent provision \r\n  of Â§ 15 is not an affirmative grant of franchise power, but is a restriction \r\n  on legislative authority.â€) (Emphasis in original). Therefore, prior to receiving \r\n  the Countyâ€™s consent, Williamsburg Water was prohibited from entering into any \r\n  area of the county because Section 15 of Article VIII acted as a shield barring \r\n  any such intrusion without the Countyâ€™s approval.Â  In this case, the Countyâ€™s \r\n  constructive consent simply removed this constitutional shield; it did not, \r\n  however, convert a previously non-existent right into a right that is exclusive \r\n  against all others, including the County.Â  Nothing in section 33-35-90 or case \r\n  law of this state suggests such an extensive interpretation.Â  \r\nThe cases in South Carolina that have addressed conflicts \r\n  between rural service providers and governmental bodies give little guidance \r\n  under the facts of this case.Â  Both parties directed this courtâ€™s attention \r\n  to the line of cases involving annexation, including City of Aiken and \r\n  City of Abbeville, as well as City of Rock Hill v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n \r\n  of S.C., 308 S.C. 175, 417 S.E.2d 562 (1992), South Carolina Electric \r\n  &amp; Gas Co. v. Berkeley Elec. Co-op., Inc., 306 S.C. 228, 411 S.E.2d 218 \r\n  (1991), Berkeley Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 304 S.C. \r\n  15, 402 S.E.2d 674 (1991), and Blue Ridge Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. City of Seneca, \r\n  297 S.C. 283, 376 S.E.2d 514 (1989).\r\nIn this line of cases, the common facts involved a \r\n  municipalityâ€™s annexation of land which was within an area that the Public Service \r\n  Commission had assigned to a rural service provider. An irreconcilable conflict \r\n  developed between the alleged right of the rural service provider to expand \r\n  its services within its assigned area and the municipalityâ€™s right to determine \r\n  who would provide services within the newly incorporated area.Â  Cf., \r\n  City of Rock Hill, 308 S.C. at 178, 417 S.E.2d at 564.Â  If the rural \r\n  service provider possessed an exclusive right to service the area, the municipality \r\n  could not offer the services.Â  However, the municipality could prevent the rural \r\n  service provider from using the municipalityâ€™s streets to extend its services \r\n  by refusing to give consent as provided for in Section 15 of Article VIII.Â  \r\n  The result of this situation would be that the citizens within the disputed \r\n  area would effectively be denied service because the rights possessed by each \r\n  would prevent the other from servicing the area. Cf., id.; Blue \r\n  Ridge, 297 S.C. at 289, 376 S.E.2d at 517-18.Â  The supreme court refused \r\n  to compel the municipalities to give their consent to the assigned provider \r\n  because limiting a municipalityâ€™s right to choose fatally undermines the concept \r\n  of consent. Cf., City of Rock Hill, 308 S.C. at 178, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  at 564; Blue Ridge, 297 S.C. at 289, 376 S.E.2d at 517-18. Instead, the \r\n  supreme court found the service rights possessed by the provider were not exclusive \r\n  and that the right of consent embodied the right of the municipality to designate \r\n  a supplier of the municipalityâ€™s choosing.Â  Cf., Berkeley Elec. Coop., \r\n  304 S.C. at 19-20, 402 S.E.2d at 677.\r\nWe find the annexation cases inapposite because in \r\n  those cases, the source of the providerâ€™s service rights was an assignment by \r\n  the Public Service Commission whereas Williamsburg Water acquired its service \r\n  right as a result of the Countyâ€™s consent, which resulted from the Countyâ€™s \r\n  failure to comply with section 33-35-90.Â  Thus, unlike the annexation cases, \r\n  the governmental body invading Williamsburg Waterâ€™s proposed service area is \r\n  the same body from which consent was obtained for that service.Â  Moreover, in \r\n  the annexation cases, the service providers were allowed to continue servicing \r\n  areas where they maintained existing service.Â  In this case, Williamsburg Water \r\n  has no existing service facilities anywhere within the disputed region.Â  There \r\n  are two fundamental elements underlying the annexation cases which distinguish \r\n  them from this case: (1) the governing body never consented to the provider, \r\n  and (2) the provider had existing service in some portion of the disputed area.Â  \r\n  Because neither of these elements is present here, the annexation cases offer \r\n  little guidance in resolving a dispute of this posture.Â  \r\nBy failing to comply with section \r\n  33-35-90, the County consented to Williamsburg Waterâ€™s service proposal.Â  Therefore, \r\n  unlike in the annexation cases, this factor is decided in favor of Williamsburg \r\n  Water.Â  However, nothing in section 33-35-90 suggests that the receipt of constructive \r\n  consent is tantamount to obtaining a right so exclusive as to operate against \r\n  the very entity from which the consent was initially required.Â  Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s service rights are not superior to the Countyâ€™s own right to decide \r\n  who will provide water and sewer services to its citizens, especially considering \r\n  that Williamsburg Water has no existing service facilities in place as seen \r\n  in the annexation cases. [5] Â  \r\nThe difficulty of this case lies in giving \r\n  effect to the rights acquired by Williamsburg Water as a result of the Countyâ€™s \r\n  failure to comply with section 33-35-90.Â  If this statute is to have any meaning, \r\n  there must be some enforceable quality belonging to those rights; otherwise, \r\n  a party obtaining approval under this statute receives, in effect, nothing at \r\n  all.Â  Complicating the matter is the fact that during the pendency of this appeal, \r\n  the County awarded numerous franchises affecting the disputed area, and those \r\n  facilities are presently under development for the benefit of the people of \r\n  Williamsburg County.Â  Thus, in this case, valid but competing interests are \r\n  diametrically opposed.Â  An unfortunate result of our ruling today is that Williamsburg \r\n  Water likely possesses a right which has little commercial value in light of \r\n  the Countyâ€™s intrusion into the designated service area.Â Â  Nevertheless, in \r\n  the absence of case law on point, and without specific language in section 33-35-90 \r\n  compelling the grant of exclusive rights, we hold that Williamsburg Water does \r\n  not possess an exclusive service right within the described service area; rather, \r\n  as the circuit court found, it possesses a non-exclusive service right.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nApplicability \r\n  of the Franchise Ordinance to Williamsburg Water  \r\nWilliamsburg Water argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to find as a matter of law that it was exempt from the Countyâ€™s franchise ordinance \r\n  because it was a bona fide water/sewer system as defined by the ordinance.Â  \r\n  This issue is not directly appealable.\r\nThe supreme courtâ€™s recent decision in Olson v. Faculty \r\n  House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 580 S.E.2d 440 (2003), resolves the \r\n  issue of the appealability of the denial of a motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  While in the past this court has, in its discretion, heard an appeal from the \r\n  denial of summary judgment where there was another appealable issue before the \r\n  court, that is no longer the rule in South Carolina.Â  Olson expressly \r\n  holds â€œthe denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable, even after \r\n  final judgment.â€Â  In so holding, the supreme court expressly overruled cases \r\n  that are inconsistent with this rule.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, the trial court found there was a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact as to whether Williamsburg Water was a bona fide water/sewer \r\n  system thereby exempting it from the Countyâ€™s franchise ordinance.Â  On remand, \r\n  the trial court must first decide whether the ordinance is capable of being \r\n  applied to Williamsburg Water in consideration of the timing and manner of its \r\n  enactment. [6] Â  Should the trial \r\n  court determine the ordinance is capable of being applied to Williamsburg Water, \r\n  it must then determine whether Williamsburg Water is exempt from the ordinance \r\n  under either of the prescribed circumstances stated in the ordinance.Â  See \r\n  Section II, Williamsburg County Ordinance No. 1995-3 (â€œAll areas of the county \r\n  not now served by an existing bona fide water/sewer system or located \r\n  within a County Council approved water/sewer service area are hearby designated \r\n  as within the County water/sewer system service area.â€).Â  Pursuant to the express \r\n  terms of the ordinance, all areas that qualify under either of the exemptions \r\n  stated above are not within the Countyâ€™s water/sewer system service area.\r\nThe fact that this issue is not directly \r\n  appealable does not preclude the parties from again moving for summary judgment \r\n  on this issue on the same or other grounds not previously considered by the \r\n  trial court.Â  The denial of summary judgment does not finally determine the \r\n  merits of the case, and issues raised in a motion may be raised again in a motion \r\n  to reconsider summary judgment or in a motion for directed verdict.Â  Brown \r\n  v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 416-17, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n  The parties may make a later motion for summary judgment based on matters not \r\n  involved in the decision on the first motion.Â  Croswell Enters., Inc. v. \r\n  Arnold, 309 S.C. 276, 279, 422 S.E.2d 157, 159 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIII.Â  The South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\nA.Â  The Countyâ€™s immunity \r\n  from liability\r\nWilliamsburg Water maintains the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to the County on Williamsburg Waterâ€™s tort cause of action \r\n  because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the County \r\n  acted in a grossly negligent manner.Â  We disagree.\r\nWilliamsburg Water alleged that the Countyâ€™s gross negligence \r\n  in undertaking to provide water and sewer service to areas designated in Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s approved proposal caused Williamsburg Water damages as a result of its \r\n  inability to obtain federal funding and, likewise, to provide service within \r\n  the exclusive service area.Â  The circuit court found the County was immune from \r\n  liability under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.\r\n  The South Carolina Tort Claims Act declares that the State, \r\n  its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental entities are â€œliable \r\n  for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual \r\n  under like circumstances,â€ subject to certain limitations and exemptions within \r\n  the Act. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 2002).Â  Section 15-78-60 sets forth \r\n  exceptions to this waiver of sovereign immunity, and the exceptions restore \r\n  certain limitations on the liability of a governmental entity.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 2002).Â  Section 15-78-60(12) provides that a government entity \r\n  is not liable for loss resulting from:\r\n\r\nlicensing powers or functions including, but not limited \r\n  to, the issuance, denial, suspension, renewal, or revocation of or failure or \r\n  refusal to issue, deny, suspend, renew, or revoke any permit, license, certificate, \r\n  approval, registration, order, or similar authority except when the power \r\n  or function is exercised in a grossly negligent manner[.]\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nâ€œGross negligence is the intentional, conscious failure to \r\n  do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally \r\n  that one ought not to do.â€ Clyburn v. Sumter County Sch. Dist. No. 17, \r\n  317 S.C. 50, 53, 451 S.E.2d 885, 887 (1994).Â  â€œIt is the failure to exercise \r\n  even the slightest care.â€Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t. of Juvenile Justice, \r\n  350 S.C. 315, 331-32, 566 S.E.2d 536, 544 (2002).Â  â€œGross negligence . . . means \r\n  the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.â€Â  Etheredge \r\n  v. Richland Sch. Dist. One, 341 S.C. 307, 310, 534 S.E.2d 275, 277 (2000).Â  \r\n  â€œAdditionally, while gross negligence ordinarily is a mixed question of law \r\n  and fact, when the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, the question \r\n  becomes a matter of law for the court.â€ Id.\r\nAlthough the County failed to comply with section 33-35-90 \r\n  regarding notice to Williamsburg Water, there is no evidence to support Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s allegation that the Countyâ€™s conduct rose to the level of gross negligence.Â  \r\n  The record contains no indication that the County intentionally sought to interfere \r\n  with Williamsburg Waterâ€™s ability to service the area.Â  Rather, the evidence \r\n  suggests the County proceeded under the mistaken impression that it satisfied \r\n  the notice provisions of section 33-35-90 when it gave public readings of the \r\n  proposed ordinance.Â  Accordingly, contrary to Williamsburg Waterâ€™s contention, \r\n  the evidence indicates the County was unaware that Williamsburg Water had acquired \r\n  any service rights within the disputed area.Â  Therefore, we believe the only \r\n  reasonable inference from the evidence is that any intrusion by the County upon \r\n  Williamsburg Waterâ€™s service rights was unintentional and not the product of \r\n  gross negligence.Â  The Tort Claims Act bars recovery from government entities \r\n  under such circumstances.Â  \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The statute of limitations\r\nWilliamsburg Water argues the trial court \r\n  erred in determining its tort claims against the County were barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations.Â  We need not decide this issue in light of our holding that \r\n  the County was entitled to summary judgment based on the lack of evidence supporting \r\n  Williamsburg Waterâ€™s claim of gross negligence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold today that section 33-35-90 does not \r\n  convey exclusive service rights to Williamsburg Water on the facts of this case.Â  \r\n  Nothing in the statutory language suggests such an extensive interpretation, \r\n  and a contrary finding would be inconsistent with our view of the veto power \r\n  granted to counties and municipalities by virtue of Section 15 of Article VIII \r\n  of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  By failing to act, the County consented \r\n  to Williamsburg Waterâ€™s proposal, but that consent does not transform a non-existent \r\n  service right into an exclusive service right. \r\nWe also affirm the circuit courtâ€™s grant of \r\n  summary judgment in favor of the County with respect to Williamsburg Waterâ€™s \r\n  causes of action in tort, holding that the County is immune from liability under \r\n  the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  The denial of summary judgment as to whether \r\n  the franchise ordinance applies to Williamsburg Water is not appealable, and \r\n  that issue is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent \r\n  with this opinion.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n CURETON, HUFF, HOWARD, BEATTY, JJ., and JEFFERSON, A.J., concur.\r\n ANDERSON, J. (Concurring in Result ONLY in a Separate \r\n  Opinion):Â  I concur in result ONLY.Â  I disagree with the reasoning \r\n  and analysis of the majority.\r\nWilliamsburg Rural Water and Sewer Company, Inc. (Williamsburg Water) commenced \r\n  this action against Williamsburg County, Williamsburg County Water and Sewer \r\n  Authority, and the Town of Kingstree (collectively, the County),1 \r\n  seeking: (1) a determination of Williamsburg Waterâ€™s right to provide water \r\n  and sewer service within designated unincorporated areas in Williamsburg County; \r\n  (2) damages in tort based on the Countyâ€™s actions; and (3) injunctive relief.Â  \r\n  The circuit court granted summary judgment to the County finding that Williamsburg \r\n  Water did not have the exclusive right to provide service to the designated \r\n  areas, and that Williamsburg Waterâ€™s cause of action in tort was barred by the \r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the statute of limitations.Â  Williamsburg \r\n  Water appeals.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe facts of the case are largely undisputed and are gathered from \r\n  a timeline of events to which the parties stipulated.Â  On January 16, 1995, \r\n  W.N. Kellahan, an organizer of Williamsburg Water, sent a letter to Elwood Gerald, \r\n  the Countyâ€™s director of rural and community development, notifying the County \r\n  of Williamsburg Waterâ€™s intention to provide service to certain unincorporated \r\n  areas of Williamsburg County pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-35-90 (1990).2Â  Section 33-35-90 articulates a statutory mechanism \r\n  for a non-profit corporation to furnish water and sewer services within the \r\n  geographical areas designated in its articles of incorporation, subject to certain \r\n  conditions relating to notice and consent.\r\nIn March and again in April of 1995, Kellahan appeared before the \r\n  Williamsburg County Council on behalf of Williamsburg Water to reiterate Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s intent to provide services to the designated areas.Â  Kellahan sent a \r\n  copy of Williamsburg Waterâ€™s master plan to the council and to Gerald.Â  In May \r\n  of 1995, Williamsburg Water filed its articles of incorporation with the Secretary \r\n  of State.Â  Shortly thereafter, Williamsburg Water initiated applications for \r\n  loans and federal grants to fund its operation.\r\nDuring this same time period, the county council began considering \r\n  enacting an ordinance that would allow the County to expand its own water and \r\n  sewer system to the same unincorporated areas that Williamsburg Water intended \r\n  to service.Â  The proposed ordinance allowed the County to grant franchises to \r\n  organizations that submitted applications to the County seeking permission to \r\n  provide service to unincorporated areas within the County.\r\nOn August 7, 1995, the County adopted the proposed franchise ordinance.Â  \r\n  In May of 1998, the County applied for federal funding to construct a rural \r\n  water system.Â  On November 3, 1998, the County opened bids for water and sewer \r\n  services to the Industrial Park located within the same service area designated \r\n  in Williamsburg Waterâ€™s articles of incorporation.Â  The County awarded the bid \r\n  to Tom Brigman Contractors, Inc., of Newberry, South Carolina, on November 9, \r\n  1998.\r\nIn response, Williamsburg Water filed an action against the County \r\n  on December 4, 1998, claiming that Williamsburg Water had the exclusive right \r\n  to provide services to the specified unincorporated areas of Williamsburg County, \r\n  including the area where the Industrial Park was located.Â  Williamsburg Water \r\n  further averred the County intentionally interfered with and/or threatened to \r\n  interfere with Williamsburg Waterâ€™s ability to obtain federal funding and to \r\n  provide service within the designated areas.Â  The complaint alleged that as \r\n  a result of the Countyâ€™s grossly negligent actions, Williamsburg Water suffered \r\n  injury and damages.Â  Finally, Williamsburg Water sought a declaration that it \r\n  was a bona fide water system and, therefore, exempt from the Countyâ€™s franchise \r\n  ordinance and that it had an exclusive right to service the unincorporated areas \r\n  of the County.\r\nWilliamsburg Water and the County filed cross motions for summary \r\n  judgment.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to the County on Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s first cause of action, ruling that Williamsburg Water did not have the \r\n  exclusive right to provide water and sewer service to the designated areas.Â  \r\n  The court granted summary judgment to the County on Williamsburg Waterâ€™s tort \r\n  cause of action, finding the County was immune from liability under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act and that the statute of limitations had run.Â  However, \r\n  the circuit court found there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \r\n  Williamsburg Water was a bona fide water system exempt from the Countyâ€™s franchise \r\n  ordinance.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate only when â€˜the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â  Trivelas \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 130, 558 S.E.2d 271, 273 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP); see also Sauner v. Public \r\n  Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003) (summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must \r\n  prevail as a matter of law).Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate where further \r\n  inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of \r\n  the law.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, 349 S.C. 356, 563 S.E.2d \r\n  331 (2002); Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 561 S.E.2d 654 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment \r\n  purposes, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from \r\n  the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  \r\n  Cunningham v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003); \r\n  Glasscock, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 557 \r\n  S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary judgment has the initial \r\n  burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Regions \r\n  Bank v. Schmauch, Â Â Â S.C.Â Â  , 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003); \r\n  Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, \r\n  and Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Once the \r\n  party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence \r\n  of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest \r\n  on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Baughman v.

App. 2001).\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming \r\n  v.

Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 33-35-90 (1990).Â  Moreover, Â§ 33-35-90 contains language which indicates that \r\n  its service would NOT be exclusive.Â  Section 33-35-90 states in relevant part: \r\n\r\n\r\n[S]uch corporations are specifically authorized to borrow \r\n  funds and contract with municipalities, counties and other political subdivisions \r\n  for the provision of such services in accordance with this chapter and the Rural \r\n  Development Act of 1972, and counties, municipalities and other political subdivisions \r\n  are authorized to so contract with such nonprofit corporations.\r\n\r\nSection 33-35-90 does not confer upon Williamsburg Water any specific right, \r\n  nor does it impose upon the County a duty owed Williamsburg Water in this case.\r\nFurthermore, section 33-35-170 limits the application of Â§ 33-35-90.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-35-170 (1990).3Â  Pursuant to Â§ 33-35-170, â€œ[t]he powers and authorities \r\n  conferred by this chapter shall be in addition to and supplemental to any other \r\n  general, special or local law.Â  This chapter is complete in itself and shall \r\n  not repeal by implication or otherwise any other general, special or local law.â€Â  \r\n  This section does not grant any special powers by the provisions of this chapter \r\n  or Â§ 33-35-90.Â  It makes these provisions supplemental to and does not repeal \r\n  any other general, special or local law.\r\nThe provisions of the South Carolina Constitution place restrictions on what \r\n  the General Assembly may do through statutes.Â  See Knight v. Salisbury, \r\n  262 S.C. 565, 206 S.E.2d 875 (1974).Â  Article VIII, Section 15 of the South \r\n  Carolina Constitution provides:\r\n\r\nNo law shall be passed by the General Assembly granting the right to construct \r\n  and operate in a public street or on public property a street or other railway, \r\n  telegraph, telephone or electric plant, or to erect water, sewer or gas works \r\n  for public use, or to lay mains for any purpose, or to use the streets for any \r\n  other such facility, without first obtaining the consent of the governing body \r\n  of the municipality in control of the streets or public places proposed to be \r\n  occupied for any such or like purpose; nor shall any law be passed by \r\n  the General Assembly granting the right to construct and operate in \r\n  a public street or on public property a street or other railway, or to erect \r\n  waterworks for public use, or to lay water or sewer mains for any purpose, \r\n  or to use the streets for any facility other than telephone, telegraph, gas \r\n  and electric, without first obtaining the consent of the governing body \r\n  of the county or the consolidated political subdivision in control of \r\n  the streets or public places proposed to be occupied for any such or like purpose.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 15 (emphasis added).Â  Article VIII, Section 16 reads: \r\n  â€œAny incorporated municipality may, upon a majority vote of the electors of \r\n  such political subdivision who shall vote on the question, acquire by initial \r\n  construction or purchase and may operate gas, water, sewer, electric, transportation \r\n  or other public utility systems and plants.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 16.\r\nArticle VIII, Â§ 15 prohibits the legislature from passing any law granting \r\n  a right to construct or operate a water or sewer system without the consent \r\n  of the countyâ€™s governing body.Â  City of Aiken v. Aiken Elec. Coop., Inc., \r\n  305 S.C. 466, 409 S.E.2d 403 (1991).Â  No statute passed by the legislature can \r\n  limit or undermine the constitutional requirement of the countyâ€™s consent.Â  \r\n  See Blue Ridge Elec. Coop., Inc. v. City of Seneca, 297 S.C. 283, \r\n  376 S.E.2d 514 (1989).\r\nArticle VIII, section 15 requires consent of the county at the time \r\n  a water or sewer system is first constructed or when it is expanded.Â  See \r\n  City of Cayce v. AT&amp;T Communications, 326 S.C. 237, 486 S.E.2d 92 \r\n  (1997); City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. Coop., Inc., 287 S.C. 361, 338 \r\n  S.E.2d 831 (1985).Â  The consent requirement of Article VIII, section 15 permits \r\n  counties to impose conditions on the grant of their consent to allow utilities \r\n  to build and operate water and electric systems.Â  City of Cayce, 326 \r\n  S.C. at 241-42, 486 S.E.2d at 94.Â  Counties have the right to grant public utility \r\n  franchises and to determine who may or may not serve county residents.Â  South \r\n  Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v.

Coop., Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, \r\n  304 S.C. 15, 402 S.E.2d 674 (1991), our Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nWe reject Co-opâ€™s claim that, while a municipality may, itself, provide \r\n  electric service within corporate limits, it may not designate a supplier through \r\n  a franchise agreement.Â  Our holdings in City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. \r\n  Co-op., Inc. and Blue Ridge Elec. Co-op v. City of Seneca are dispositive \r\n  of this issue.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In Abbeville, we rejected a municipalityâ€™s claim that it had \r\n  the right to oust an existing electric supplier upon annexation.Â  We stated:\r\n\r\n  \r\n[A] franchisee possessing a valid PSC territorial assignment to serve an area \r\n  which is subsequently annexed:\r\n1.Â  Is permitted to continue service in that area to those premises being served \r\n  at the time of annexation;\r\n2.Â  Is prohibited, without prior consent of the municipality, from extending \r\n  or expanding service in that area by the use of any streets, alleys, public \r\n  property or ways after the date of annexation.\r\n  \r\n287 S.C. at 370-371, 338 S.E.2d at 836.\r\nIn Blue Ridge, we addressed an assigned supplierâ€™s challenge to a municipal \r\n  utility which provided electricity in a newly annexed area.Â  There, we held \r\n  that â€œa municipality may either consent to expanded service by the assigned \r\n  supplier or itself serve new premises and customers within the assigned, annexed \r\n  area.â€Â  297 S.C. at 289, 376 S.E.2d at 517.\r\nThe basic premise upon which Abbeville and Blue Ridge \r\n  rest is a municipalityâ€™s right of consent under S.C. Const. Art. VIII, Â§ 15.Â  \r\n  In Blue Ridge, we declined to interpret the Territorial Assignments Act, \r\n  as amended by Act 431 of 1984, in a way violative of this right.Â  We stated:\r\n  \r\nAbsent the option of municipal service to new premises and customers in assigned, \r\n  annexed areas, the assigned supplier would possess, for all practical purposes, \r\n  an exclusive territorial service right.Â  Municipalities could not realistically \r\n  deny consent to expanded service by these assigned suppliers; denying consent \r\n  would be tantamount to denying property owners in the annexed area any electric \r\n  service at all.\r\n  \r\n297 S.C. at 289, 376 S.E.2d at 517-518.\r\nHere, Co-opâ€™s contention that a municipally-franchised utility should \r\n  be distinguished from a municipally-owned utility effectually denies Summervilleâ€™s \r\n  right of consent, leaving Summerville with the sole alternative of permitting \r\n  Co-op to provide the service.Â  This would clearly violate Abbeville and \r\n  Blue Ridge, supra.\r\nSummerville has granted SCE &amp; G its consent \r\n  to serve the annexed area by virtue of the franchise agreement.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Circuit Court correctly held that SCE &amp; G may continue providing electric \r\n  service to Hardeeâ€™s.\r\n\r\nBerkeley Elec. Coop., Inc., 304 S.C. at 18-20, 402 S.E.2d at 676-77 \r\n  (footnotes and emphasis omitted).\r\nThe Court addressed the efficacy of Article VIII, section 15 of the \r\n  South Carolina Constitution in City of Aiken v. Aiken Elec. Coop., Inc., \r\n  305 S.C. 466, 409 S.E.2d 403 (1991):\r\n\r\nArticle VIII, Section 15, of the South Carolina \r\n  Constitution prohibits the General Assembly from enacting laws which grant the \r\n  right to construct or operate upon the streets or property of a municipality \r\n  without first obtaining the consent of such municipality.\r\nThis Court has affirmed the right of municipalities to authorize expansion \r\n  of existing service or to provide alternative service.Â  See Berkeley \r\n  Elec. Co-Op v. S.C. Public Service Commâ€™n, [304 S.C. 15,] 402 S.E.2d 674 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. 1991) (citing Blue Ridge Elec. Co-Op v. City of Seneca, \r\n  297 S.C. 283, 376 S.E.2d 514 (1989)); City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. Co-Op, \r\n  287 S.C. 361, 338 S.E.2d 831 (1985).Â  When service to a new area is not provided \r\n  by the municipality, the municipally assigned supplier possesses exclusive rights.Â  \r\n  Our holding in Berkeley makes no distinction between a municipally owned \r\n  supplier and a municipally franchised supplier.Â  Hence, service by a franchised \r\n  supplier is considered municipal service.\r\nWe find that the City was within its constitutional \r\n  authority to designate an electric service supplier for new customers in the \r\n  annexed area and to enact ordinances affecting other suppliers of electricity.Â  \r\n  S.C. Const. Art. VIII, Â§ 15.\r\n\r\nCity of Aiken, 305 S.C. at 468, 409 S.E.2d at 404.\r\n\r\nArticle VIII, section 15 was further discussed in City of Rock Hill v. Public \r\n  Serv. Commâ€™n, 308 S.C. 175, 417 S.E.2d 562 (1992):\r\n  \r\nArticle VIII, Â§ 15 of the South Carolina Constitution provides:\r\nNo law shall be passed by the General Assembly granting the right to construct \r\n  and operate in a public street or on public property a street or other railway, \r\n  telegraph, telephone or electric plant, or to erect water, sewer or gas works \r\n  for public use, or to lay mains for any purpose, or to use the streets for any \r\n  other such facility, without first obtaining the consent of the governing body \r\n  of the municipality in control of the streets or public places proposed to be \r\n  occupied for any such or like purpose.\r\n  \r\nWe have interpreted this provision in several cases.Â  In City of Abbeville \r\n  v. Aiken Elec. Co-op., Inc., 287 S.C. 361, 338 S.E.2d 831 (1985), we held \r\n  that a municipality did not have the right to oust an existing electric supplier \r\n  when the assigned area was subsequently annexed.Â  However, we also determined \r\n  that expansion by the use of any city street or public property by the supplier \r\n  within the annexed area without the municipalityâ€™s consent was prohibited.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  In Blue Ridge Electric v. City of Seneca, 297 S.C. 283, 376 \r\n  S.E.2d 514 (1989), the issue presented was whether a municipality could service \r\n  new customers in an area assigned to another electrical supplier once the area \r\n  was annexed into the city.Â  We held that denying the municipalities the right \r\n  to serve in the annexed areas would be tantamount to leaving the assigned supplier \r\n  with an exclusive territorial right since the municipality would be faced with \r\n  the choice of denying the property owners power or consenting to the assigned \r\n  supplierâ€™s use of the streets and public ways for expansion of their service.Â  \r\n  As this would create an irreconcilable conflict between the Act 431 and municipalityâ€™s \r\n  rights under Article VIII Â§ 15, we determined a municipality could not be enjoined \r\n  from serving new customers within the annexed property.\r\nIn subsequent cases, this Court held the cityâ€™s right to consent included \r\n  the power to designate another supplier other than the municipal utility or \r\n  the assigned supplier.Â  Berkeley Electric Co-op. v. South Carolina Public \r\n  Service Commission, 304 S.C. 15, 402 S.E.2d 674 (1991); City of Aiken \r\n  v. Aiken Elec.

Berkeley Electric Cooperative, Inc., 306 S.C. 228, \r\n  411 S.E.2d 218 (1991).Â  In these cases, we have implicitly acknowledged that \r\n  without the ability to provide service or authorize another utility to provide \r\n  service, the constitutional right to grant or withhold consent would be meaningless.\r\n\r\nCity of Rock Hill, 308 S.C. at 177-78, 417 S.E.2d at 563-64.\r\nSection 4-9-30(11) of the South Carolina Code authorizes counties â€œto grant \r\n  franchises and make charges in areas outside the corporate limits of municipalities \r\n  within the county in the manner provided by law for municipalities and subject \r\n  to the same limitations, to provide for the orderly control of services and \r\n  utilities affected with the public interest.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-30(11) (Supp. \r\n  2002).Â  The Williamsburg County Council passed a franchise ordinance regulating \r\n  the water franchises to various entities in Williamsburg County which became \r\n  effective on August 7, 1995.Â  In Glendale Water Corp. v. City of Florence, \r\n  274 S.C. 472, 265 S.E.2d 41 (1980), our Supreme Court approved of cities extending \r\n  their water lines if they had a valid franchise from the County.\r\nThe issue of exclusivity of a franchise is vested \r\n  in the governmental entity pursuant to Article VIII, sections 15 and 16 of the \r\n  South Carolina Constitution.Â  The General Assembly may enact legislation placing \r\n  responsibility upon a governmental entity to act upon a request by a non-governmental \r\n  entity to provide water and sewer services by denying or granting such a request \r\n  under certain conditions and time parameters.Â  Section 33-35-90 is the paradigm \r\n  of a legislative act involving procedural responses mandated by a governmental \r\n  entity to either provide water and sewer services or to allow a non-governmental \r\n  entity to engage in these activities.Â  This section was efficacious at the time \r\n  of the filing of the application by Williamsburg Water.Â  Because the County \r\n  is bound by the â€œlaw of the caseâ€ doctrine in regard to the issue of consent, \r\n  my analysis is limited to the facts of this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI find that the issue of governmental consent by the \r\n  County is controlled by the ruling of the circuit judge.Â  His conclusion that \r\n  Williamsburg Water gave proper and adequate notice under Â§ 33-35-90 became the \r\n  law of the case.\r\nBased on the constitutional provisions and the evolving precedent \r\n  extant in this field, I hold that Williamsburg Water is entitled to a non-exclusive \r\n  right to provide water and sewer service to the areas designated in \r\n  its proposal made pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-35-90.Â  I rule the County \r\n  has a non-exclusive right to provide water and sewer service in \r\n  the areas designated in the proposal.\r\nAccordingly, I VOTE to AFFIRM the order of the circuit court.\r\nSTILWELL, J.Â  (concurring \r\n  in result only):Â  Although I agree with the result of this case, I write \r\n  separately to explain my reasoning, which differs from both the majority opinion \r\n  and Judge Andersonâ€™s opinion concurring in result only.\r\nThe critical issue is whether Williamsburg Waterâ€™s \r\n  notice to the county and the countyâ€™s action or inaction thereafter vested Williamsburg \r\n  Water with the exclusive right to provide water service in the subject area \r\n  or a non-exclusive right to provide such service.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order holding \r\n  Williamsburg Waterâ€™s authority to be non-exclusive came as a result of rather \r\n  generic mutual motions for summary judgment, neither of which focused on the \r\n  issue of whether the rights obtained were exclusive or non-exclusive.Â Â  There \r\n  may well be a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the statute, \r\n  Williamsburg Waterâ€™s notice, and Williamsburg Countyâ€™s response or lack thereof \r\n  creates exclusive or non-exclusive rights.\r\nHowever, the status of this appeal is such that \r\n  we are not able to address that issue.Â  The question presented on appeal is \r\n  whether the trial court erred in failing to find that Williamsburg Water had \r\n  exclusive right and authority to serve within the specified area and Williamsburg \r\n  Waterâ€™s arguments all focus on its contention that it is so entitled.Â  Thus, \r\n  the issue as presented is the functional equivalent of an appeal of the refusal \r\n  to grant summary judgment, an issue that is not appealable.Â  Ballenger v. \r\n  Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994); Olson v. Faculty House of \r\n  Carolina, 354 S.C. 161, 580 S.E.2d 440 (2003).Â  \r\nNowhere in Williamsburg Waterâ€™s brief do I find \r\n  an assertion that the court erred in ruling that Williamsburg Waterâ€™s rights \r\n  were non-exclusive.Â  Because that finding was not appealed, it is the law of \r\n  the case and not subject to review by this court.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, \r\n  LP, v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Brentley Blalock was tried \r\n  on two counts ofÂ  criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Blalock was acquitted \r\n  on one count and convicted on the second count. Blalock appeals his conviction, \r\n  arguing the trial judge committed reversible error by allowing the state to \r\n  present extrinsic evidence in connection with a prior inconsistent statement \r\n  by his wife, Lee Blalock. We affirm, finding the trial court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion in admitting the evidence. [1] \r\nFACTS/BACKGROUND [2] \r\nOn July 11, 2000, 14-year-old \r\n  Jane Smith [3]  and her family \r\n  visited the home of their neighbors, Brentley and Lee Blalock.Â  After passing \r\n  the afternoon with the Blalocks, the Smiths returned to their nearby home.Â  \r\n  Jane, however, asked and was allowed to stay for a while longer.Â  Brentley Blalock, \r\n  Lee Blalock, one of their sons, and Jane continued watching television and â€œplaying \r\n  aroundâ€ in the living room.Â  After a while, Ms. Blalock left the room to take \r\n  care of some chores in the adjacent kitchen.Â  During this time, Jane claimed \r\n  Brentley Blalock committed a sexual battery upon her.\r\nAt the center of this appeal is a statement Ms. \r\n  Blalock provided to a police detective investigating the incident on the evening \r\n  of July 11, 2000.Â  In the statement, transcribed by the detective, Ms. Blalock \r\n  described what she saw that night.Â  In the critical portion of the narrative, \r\n  Ms. Blalock reportedly said that when she returned from the kitchen to the living \r\n  room she â€œsaw [Jane] laying on her stomach in front of the T.V.Â  Brentley [Blalock] \r\n  was sitting beside her.Â  I noticed he had his hand under her pants leg on her \r\n  backside.â€\r\nAt trial, the prosecution called Ms. Blalock as \r\n  a witness and examined her regarding what she saw on July 11, 2000 â€“ focusing \r\n  primarily on her statement to the police detective.Â  Initially, however, the \r\n  solicitor did not confront her with the exact words recorded in the statement.Â  \r\n  Instead, the solicitor characterized Ms. Blalockâ€™s statement in different termsâ€”adding \r\n  and deleting key words and changing the order of the words.Â  \r\nThe solicitor first asked Ms. Blalock whether she \r\n  saw her â€œhusbandâ€™s hand under [Janeâ€™s] pants and on her bottom.â€Â  The solicitorâ€™s \r\n  substitution of the word â€œpantsâ€ for â€œpants legâ€ and â€œbottomâ€ for â€œbacksideâ€ \r\n  contributed to the confusion that would follow.Â  Ms. Blalock answered â€œnoâ€ and \r\n  attempted to explain: \r\n\r\nI did not see his hand on her \r\n  butt per se, just for lack of a better word.Â  When I walked in, they were fine, \r\n  looking at television. She had shorts on that were what would have been acceptable \r\n  for school. Her parents didnâ€™t allow her to wear teenybopper type clothes.Â  \r\n  So, they were kind of long and I did see his hand underneath her shorts on her \r\n  leg.Â  \r\n\r\nMs. Blalock apparently then tried to correct the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s misquotation of her statement, explaining that â€œin my statement, \r\n  it says on her back side.â€Â  Before Ms. Blalock could continue, however, the \r\n  solicitor protested to the court that she was being â€œnon-responsiveâ€ and asked \r\n  for permission to â€œtake her as a hostile witness to impeach her under Rule 607,â€ \r\n  which was allowed.Â  \r\nThe solicitor then presented Ms. Blalock \r\n  with a copy of her statement and had her read aloud the sentences quoted above.Â  \r\n  Again, when asked to confirm or deny the statement, Ms. Blalock instead tried \r\n  to explain: â€œIâ€™m saying that maybe some of the details are missing [from the \r\n  statement].Â  Just like you pointed out with Jane, a few minutes ago, all of \r\n  the details were not included.Â  When youâ€™re upset in a time like that, you donâ€™t \r\n  think to include everything.â€\r\nAfter further questioning, the solicitor \r\n  returned to the statement a third time, but once again the solicitor changed \r\n  the actual wording, asking Ms. Blalock: â€œYou saw his hand on her back side under \r\n  her pants?â€Â  Ms. Blalock again attempted explanation, responding:\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  [Ms. Blalock]Â  Her back \r\n  side of her leg.Â  Thatâ€™s another thing that was left out.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  [Solicitor]Â  Okay.Â  \r\n  And when did you come up with that? When did you realize that was missing?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  That was sometime after \r\n  the, all the reports were gone and I had time to think over things in my mind, \r\n  and when I was more clear headed so I could remember more of the details of \r\n  what went on.\r\n\r\nAfter a break in the testimony, the solicitor revisited \r\n  the statement a final time.Â  \r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  [Solicitor]Â  Mrs. Blalock, \r\n  I want to show you your statement again, if I may, so that thereâ€™s no misunderstanding. \r\n  Okay?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  [Ms. Blalock]Â  (Witness \r\n  nods affirmatively.)\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Did you say Brentley \r\n  was sitting beside her, and I noticed he had his hand under her pants leg on \r\n  her back side?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I said that portion, \r\n  and for whatever reason, the detail of, of her leg, the back side, was left \r\n  out.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  So thatâ€™s \r\n  what you --?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  But that portion, yes.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  Did you ever \r\n  tell anybody back side of her leg until court today?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, I thought that \r\n  I did.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  Who would you \r\n  have told?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Detective Lindsey and \r\n  cops or whoever else --.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  When would you have told \r\n  Detective Lindsey?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  -- that may have been \r\n  there.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  I mean you are saying \r\n  it happened that night you told him after you signed it or the following week?Â  \r\n  When did you do this?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  It would have been at \r\n  the time of the statement.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  So, again, when \r\n  you said that, on the back side, you, at that time, you would of told him of \r\n  her leg?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  I feel like I said that.Â  \r\n  If I didnâ€™t, you know, I may have been unclear about it or he may of, you know, \r\n  been paraphrasing what I was saying.\r\n\r\nImmediately following this colloquy, the solicitor \r\n  attempted to offer the statement into evidence but withdrew the offer after \r\n  defense counsel requested a bench conference.\r\nThe State next called William Lindsey, \r\n  the police investigator who took Ms. Blalockâ€™s statement.Â  When the State sought \r\n  to publish the statement through Detective Lindsey, defense counsel objected, \r\n  citing Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  The trial court overruled the objection and Ms. Blalockâ€™s \r\n  prior inconsistent statement was published.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOur courts have consistently held that a trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to admit evidence of a witnessâ€™s prior inconsistent statement \r\n  will not be reversed absent a manifest abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Lynn, \r\n  277 S.C. 222, 225, 284 S.E.2d 786, 788 (1981);Â  State v. Sierra, 337 \r\n  S.C. 368, 373, 523 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding appellant must show \r\n  both abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBlalock argues the trial \r\n  court erred by admitting extrinsic evidence of his wifeâ€™s prior statement to \r\n  impeach her trial testimony.Â  The State claims this issue is not preserved for \r\n  appellate review.Â  We disagree on both counts.\r\nIn order to preserve an \r\n  error for appellate review, a defendant must make a contemporaneous objection \r\n  on a specific ground. Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE; Â State v. Hoffman, \r\n  312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994); State v. Holliday, 333 \r\n  S.C. 332, 338, 509 S.E.2d 280, 283 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œThe objection should be \r\n  sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged \r\n  error so that it can be reasonably understood by the trial judge.â€ McKissick \r\n  v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 344, 479 S.E.2d 67, 75 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nHere, defense counsel promptly objected when the \r\n  State sought to introduce extrinsic evidence of Ms. Blalockâ€™s prior statement.Â  \r\n  First, the court promptly replied by referencing Rule 613(b), and the state \r\n  withdrew the exhibit.Â  Next, when Detective Lindsey was asked to publish Ms. \r\n  Blalockâ€™s statement, defense counsel objected by reference to Rule 613(b).Â  \r\n  We find this evidentiary objection properly preserved.Â  We have no difficulty \r\n  discerning the issue from the targeted references by the trial court and defense \r\n  counsel to Rule 613(b) and the context from which this issue arose.\r\nRule 613(b), SCRE, provides \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nExtrinsic evidence of a prior \r\n  inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is \r\n  advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was allegedly \r\n  made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain \r\n  or deny the statement. If a witness does not admit that he has made the prior \r\n  inconsistent statement, extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\r\n\r\nThe central question, \r\n  therefore, is whether Ms. Blalock admitted making an inconsistent statement \r\n  in her testimony.Â  As described above, however, Ms. Blalockâ€™s testimony affords \r\n  little in the way of a clear admission or denial.Â  At various points in her \r\n  testimony, she concedes that the material portions of the statement were in \r\n  fact her own words; but she is simultaneously eager to explain and amend her \r\n  words and intent.Â  Overall, Ms. Blalock appears to have reacted as would be \r\n  expected of anyone who realizes he or she has been called as the star witness \r\n  against his or her spouse: self-conscious, confused, and wary of how her testimony \r\n  will be perceived by the jury.\r\nIn determining whether \r\n  a witness has admitted making a prior inconsistent statement and thereby obviated \r\n  the need for extrinsic proof, the courts of our state and other jurisdictions \r\n  have held that the witness must admit making the prior statement unequivocally \r\n  and without qualification.Â  See State v. Bottoms, 260 S.C. 187, \r\n  194, 195 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1973) (when a witness â€œadmits unequivocallyâ€ that \r\n  a prior inconsistent statement has been made by him, he has thereby impeached \r\n  himself and further evidence is unnecessary and inadmissible); 98 C.J.S. Witnesses \r\n  Â§ 727 (2002) (stating admission must be â€œunequivocalâ€).Â  \r\nGenerally, where the witness \r\n  has responded with anything less than an unequivocal admission, trial courts \r\n  have been granted wide latitude to allow extrinsic evidence proving the statement.Â  \r\n  For example, a witnessâ€™s failure to fully recall her prior statement has been \r\n  found to be a sufficient denial to allow extrinsic evidence.Â  State v. Brown, \r\n  296 S.C. 191, 193, 371 S.E.2d 523, 524 (1988); State v. Miller, 262 S.C. \r\n  369, 371, 204 S.E.2d 738, 738-39 (1974); 81 Am. Jur. 2d Witnesses Â§ 948 \r\n  (2003) (stating that a â€œwitness may be impeached by proof of prior contradictory \r\n  statements, where he merely testifies that he does not remember, or has no recollection \r\n  of, making the statements referred toâ€).Â  Extrinsic evidence is also usually \r\n  admitted when the witness simply avoids any direct answer.Â  Confronted with \r\n  this situation in State v. Sullivan, our supreme court held:\r\n\r\nIf the witness neither directly \r\n  admit [sic] nor deny [sic] the act or declaration, as when he merely says that \r\n  he does not recollect, or, as it seems, gives any other indirect answer not \r\n  amounting to an admission, it is competent for the adversary to prove the affirmative, \r\n  for otherwise the witness might in every such case exclude evidence of what \r\n  he had done or said by answering that he did not remember.\r\n\r\n43 S.C. 205, 211, 21 S.E \r\n  4, 7 (1895).\r\nIn this case, we find \r\n  Ms. Blalockâ€™s response, when confronted with her prior statement, does not meet \r\n  the standard of a clear and unequivocal admission that the precedent case law \r\n  demands.Â  We are mindful that, towards the end of the solicitorâ€™s examination \r\n  of Ms. Blalock regarding the statement, she does admit that she said the â€œportionâ€ \r\n  of the statement quoted.Â  She is adamant throughout her testimony, however, \r\n  that the statement as recorded by the detective was incomplete.Â  As demonstrated \r\n  in the excerpted testimony above, Ms. Blalock repeatedly insists that she did \r\n  not merely say she saw her husbandâ€™s hand on Janeâ€™s â€œbackside,â€ but that she \r\n  saw his hand on the â€œback side of her leg.â€Â  When the solicitor presses her \r\n  on when and to whom she said â€œback side of her leg,â€ Ms. Blalock testifies that \r\n  she â€œfeel[s] likeâ€ that is what she told Detective Lindsey at the time he took \r\n  her statement.Â  Ultimately, she equivocates as to whether the statement was \r\n  in fact her own words, testifying that she may have been â€œunclearâ€ or that Detective \r\n  Lindsey had â€œparaphrasedâ€ what she said.\r\nClearly, by repeatedly \r\n  insisting that she said or intended to say â€œback side of her legâ€ instead of \r\n  â€œbackside,â€ Ms. Blalock was attempting to dispel the implication that she actually \r\n  saw Brentley Blalockâ€™s hand on or near Janeâ€™s genital area.Â  This disparity, \r\n  therefore, goes to the essential meaning of what Detective Lindsey recorded \r\n  as Ms. Blalockâ€™s statement.Â  The entire probative value of Ms. Blalockâ€™s statement \r\n  and trial testimony hinges on where she saw her husbandâ€™s hand on Janeâ€™s body.Â  \r\n  Considered in toto, Ms. Blalockâ€™s testimony regarding her statement shrouds \r\n  its meaning in doubt.Â  Admission of extrinsic evidence to prove Ms. Blalock \r\n  made the statement was therefore relevant to the juryâ€™s consideration of the \r\n  veracity of Ms. Blalock as a witness and the consequent weight her testimony \r\n  should be afforded.\r\nWe respectfully reject \r\n  Blalockâ€™s position that State v. Lynn compels a different result.Â  First, \r\n  we are confronted with a different factual presentation.Â  We do not believe \r\n  Ms. Blalockâ€™s varyingÂ  responses rise to the level of the unequivocal admission, \r\n  as was present in Lynn, necessary to foreclose resort to extrinsic evidence.Â Â  \r\n  Second, as noted above, a significant feature in Lynn is the holding \r\n  that â€œthe cross-examination of a witness to test his credibility is largely \r\n  within the discretion of the trial judge, and his decision whether to allow \r\n  the contradictory testimony will not be disturbed on appeal except for manifest \r\n  abuse of discretion.â€ State v. Lynn 277 S.C. at 225, 284 S.E.2d at 788. \r\n  Considering we are governed by an abuse of discretion standard, we cannot say \r\n  under these facts that the trial judge erred in admitting extrinsic evidence \r\n  of Ms. Blalockâ€™s prior inconsistent statement.Â  Moreover, Detective Lindseyâ€™s \r\n  publication of the prior statement was cumulative to Ms. Blalockâ€™s previous, \r\n  unchallenged publication of the relevant portion of her statement.Â  \r\nAs a final observation, \r\n  we acknowledge Blalockâ€™s concern with the conduct of the solicitor and his role \r\n  in fostering the present controversy.Â  We are persuaded, however, that Ms. Blalockâ€™s \r\n  varying responses cannot be solely attributed to the solicitorâ€™s paraphrasing \r\n  of the prior statement.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court acted \r\n  within its discretion in admitting extrinsic evidence of Lee Blalockâ€™s prior \r\n  inconsistent statement.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and HOWARD,Â  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Blalockâ€™s appellate counsel did not represent Blalock at trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Our discussion is limited to the facts and circumstances in \r\n    connection with the charge resulting in a conviction. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  TheÂ  minorÂ  victim and her family are identified by a fictitious \r\n    name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3709","title":"Kirkman v.

Lydon, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  Pursuant to cross-motions \r\n  for summary judgment, the trial court determined that First Union, as a lender, \r\n  did not impliedly warrant the habitability of Ted and Karen Kirkmanâ€™s house.Â  \r\n  Summary judgment was granted in favor of First Union and the Kirkmans appeal.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1989, Miller Housing began the construction \r\n  of a house for speculative sale in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina.Â  Miller Housing \r\n  financed the construction through South Carolina Federal, predecessor to First \r\n  Union. [1]  Notwithstanding financial \r\n  difficulties, Miller Housing substantially completed the house by early 1991.Â  \r\n  The Kirkmans desired to purchase the property from Miller Housing in April 1991, \r\n  but the property was in foreclosure.Â  The Kirkmans agreed to a purchase price \r\n  of $232,900.Â  The foreclosure action determined that Miller Housingâ€™s indebtedness \r\n  to First Union amounted to approximately $205,000.\r\nThe Kirkmans, Miller Housing and First \r\n  Union initially agreed that First Union would not conclude the foreclosure.Â  \r\n  Other liens, however, necessitated foreclosure, and, with the partiesâ€™ consent, \r\n  the property was deeded to First Union in May 1991.Â  It was further agreed that \r\n  Miller Housing would complete construction.Â  Miller Housing failed to do so.Â  \r\n  First Union, in an effort to mitigate its losses, hired Building Services of \r\n  Charleston to complete construction, at a cost of $40,000 to $50,000.Â  Building \r\n  Services of Charlestonâ€™s work included, among other things, installation of \r\n  compressors and air handlers, but it did not include any aspect of the \r\n  artificial stucco siding which is the subject of this suit.Â  The artificial \r\n  stucco siding was installed during Miller Housingâ€™s involvement, well prior \r\n  to First Unionâ€™s involvement.Â  The house was completed and the Kirkmans took \r\n  possession of the property in July of 1991.\r\nIn 1999, the Kirkmans were pursuing the \r\n  sale of the property and discovered moisture damage in the stucco siding.Â  After \r\n  repairing the damage and selling the house, the Kirkmans filed suit against \r\n  Miller Housing, the installer of the stucco, the manufacturer of the stucco \r\n  and First Union.Â  All claims have been resolved through default or settlement \r\n  except the implied warranty of habitability against First Union.\r\nSTANDARDÂ  OFÂ  REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56, SCRCP; South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. \r\n  Assâ€™n. v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  Here, there are no material facts in dispute.Â  Thus, in light of the uncontested \r\n  factual record, the dispositive question before the courtÂ  is one ofÂ  law.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Kirkmans contend the trial court \r\n  erred in finding First Union was not liable under an implied warranty of habitability.Â  \r\n  They maintain First Union was â€œsubstantially involvedâ€ in completingÂ  construction \r\n  on the house.Â  The Kirkmans also assert that it was not necessary for First \r\n  Union to have been involved in the installation of the stucco for it to be liable \r\n  under an implied warranty of habitability.Â  We find First Union was a mere lender \r\n  protecting its interest and should not be held responsible under an implied \r\n  warranty of habitability.\r\nA warranty of habitability springs from the sale \r\n  of a home.Â  See Lane v. Trenholm Bldg. Co., 267 S.C. 497, 500, \r\n  229 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1976).Â  The warranty is grounded in the doctrine of caveat \r\n  venditor.Â  In Lane, the court found â€œ[t]he law should not orphan the \r\n  purchaser of a house, who has likely invested his life savings â€¦ by operation \r\n  of the doctrine of [c]aveat emptor.â€ Id. at 503, 229 S.E.2d at 731. It \r\n  further wrote that a sellerâ€™s â€œliability is not founded upon fault, but because \r\n  it has profited by receiving a fair price and, as between it and an innocent \r\n  purchaser, the innocent purchaser should be protected from latent defects.â€Â \r\nId.\r\nOur supreme court has established that \r\n  public policy disfavors imposing an implied warranty of habitability on a mere \r\n  lender.Â  See Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. \r\n  335, 340, 384 S.E.2d 730, 734 (1989).Â  The court concluded that imposition of \r\n  liability on mere lenders would be burdensome and would discourage lending in \r\n  the state.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the court held:Â  â€œ[I]t is unduly punitive \r\n  to impose potential warranty liability on a lender that is searching for some \r\n  way to recover the losses it has suffered due to the default of the debtor.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â Â  This court, following the Kennedy precedent, noted that \r\n  â€œa construction lender is not responsible for the torts of the borrower unless \r\n  the lender is involved in, or exercises control over, construction to an extent \r\n  that exceeds the degree of involvement normally expected of a commercial lender.â€ \r\n  Whitfield Constr. Co. v. Bank of Tokyo Trust Co., 338 S.C. 207, 216, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 888, 893 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nIn Roundtree Villas Assâ€™n, Inc. v. \r\n  4701 Kings Corporation, 282 S.C. 415, 321 S.E.2d 46 (1984), the court found \r\n  a lender was not liable for defects in construction which was completed prior \r\n  to it undertaking repairs to several units.Â  While the lender monitored the \r\n  construction, this did not create a duty to prevent defects.Â  Id. at \r\n  422, 321 S.E.2d at 50.Â  Conversely, Roundtree Villas permitted liability \r\n  against the lender when â€œit undertook to repair defects â€¦ [and] took over the \r\n  project and undertook to market the units through a corporation it had created.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 423, 321 S.E.2d at 51.\r\nA lender, however, may be held liable \r\n  under the theory of an implied warranty of habitability when its functions as \r\n  a lender are secondary to its function as a developer.Â  See Lane, \r\n  267 S.C. at 503-04, 229 S.E.2d at 730. In Lane, the developer of a subdivision \r\n  sold an undeveloped lot to a builder.Â  The developer took a second mortgage \r\n  on the house built on the lot.Â  The builder deeded the house to the developer \r\n  in satisfaction of its mortgage.Â  The developer paid off the first mortgage \r\n  on the house, and then sold it to Lane.Â  Lane experienced problems with the \r\n  septic system, and the developer was found liable under caveat venditor and \r\n  the implied warranty of habitability.Â  In that case, the court found:Â  â€œTrenholm \r\n  purported to be selling a new house and certainly Lane's objective in purchasing \r\n  the house was to provide a home for his family. The sale contemplated the use \r\n  of the house as the dwelling; an implied warranty does no more than fulfill \r\n  the reasonable expectations of the parties.â€Â  Id. at 503, 229 S.E.2d \r\n  at 730.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Kennedy, the court further \r\n  addressed the issue and found a lender might be liable under implied warranty \r\n  of habitability in certain situations:\r\n\r\nA lender will also incur liability for the performance of \r\n  express representations made to a buyer. A lender should be held responsible \r\n  if it is aware of defects but conceals them from an unwitting buyer. Liability \r\n  may also attach when the lender becomes highly involved with construction in \r\n  a manner that is not normal commercial practice for a lender. In such a situation, \r\n  the lender might be said to be a joint venturer. The lender may be liable if \r\n  it is so amalgamated with the developer or builder so as to blur its legal distinction. \r\n  A lender may also be liable where it forecloses on a developer in the midst \r\n  of construction, takes title, has substantial involvement in completing the \r\n  construction and sells homes.\r\n\r\nKennedy, 299 S.C. at 340-41, 384 S.E.2d at \r\n  734 (internal citations omitted).\r\nHere, we find the public policy reasons \r\n  advanced in Lane do not apply because the Kirkmans will not be â€œorphanedâ€ \r\n  if they are unable to proceed against First Union.Â  The Kirkmans know who built \r\n  the house, who produced the stucco siding, and who installed the stucco siding.Â  \r\n  Their lawsuit has named all involved in the stucco siding, in addition to First \r\n  Union.Â  Significantly, the Kirkmans entered into the contract for sale with \r\n  the original builder, Miller Housing.Â  They knew Miller Housing was in foreclosure \r\n  and that First Union was involved only as a lender.Â  The Kirkmans approached \r\n  First Union about completing the house when Miller failed to do so.Â  In view \r\n  of these facts, we find none of the policy considerations discussed in Lane \r\n  justifying imposing liability under an implied warranty of habitability are \r\n  present in this case.Â  \r\nMoreover, none of the situations discussed in Kennedy \r\n  favoring lender liability are present in this case.Â  The Kirkmans argue that \r\n  First Unionâ€™s expenditure of $40,000 to $50,000, standing alone, compels a finding \r\n  of First Unionâ€™s â€œsubstantial involvementâ€ in completing construction.Â  However, \r\n  we do not believe the supreme court in Kennedy intended the issue of \r\n  â€œsubstantial involvementâ€ to be determined solely by a mathematical approach.Â  \r\n  Instead, we believe the degree of a lenderâ€™s involvement, in terms of completing \r\n  construction and otherwise, must be qualitatively and quantitatively determined \r\n  from the totality of the circumstances.Â  Here, according to the first contract \r\n  entered into by the Kirkmans, First Union was not to foreclose on the property \r\n  and the Kirkmans were to purchase it outright from the builder.Â  In order to \r\n  clear title for the Kirkmans, however, the contract was later modified to allow \r\n  foreclosure by First Union. At the time, First Union was owed over $200,000 \r\n  on the property.Â  First Union was then required to complete construction, at \r\n  a cost of $40,000 to $50,000.Â  This expenditure of funds by First Union did \r\n  not alter its status as a lender because First Union had a right to expeditiously \r\n  mitigate its losses resulting from the builderâ€™s financial troubles.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe find the public policy reasons articulated \r\n  in Kennedy compel a result rejecting an imposition of lender liability \r\n  on First Union.Â  First Union was not the only party known to the Kirkmans, so \r\n  they are not â€œorphanedâ€ as in Lane.Â  First Union would not be liable, \r\n  as recognized in Roundtree Villas, for the stucco siding because it was \r\n  not involved in the installation of the stucco siding.Â  As found in Kennedy, \r\n  it would be â€œunduly punitive to impose potential warranty liability on a lender \r\n  that is searching for some way to recover the losses it has suffered due to \r\n  the default of the debtor.â€Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 340, 384 S.E.2d at \r\n  734.Â  Finally, since we find First Union was a mere lender and its completion \r\n  of construction was, at most, of secondary importance to its role as a lender, \r\n  we conclude that no valid, recognized policy would be served by imposing lender \r\n  liability on First Union.\r\n Accordingly, the decision of the circuit \r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  For simplification we collectively refer to South Carolina \r\n    Federal and its successor, First Union, as â€œFirst Union.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3710","title":"Barnes v.

Heyward Clarkson, III, Charles F. Turner, and Elizabeth \r\n  J. Smith, all of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nGeorge J. Kefalos, of Charleston and Steve Christopher Davis, \r\n  of Moncks Corner, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Â  Rudolph Barnes, as personal \r\n  representative of the Estate of Doris Barnes, filed a negligence action against \r\n  Cohen Dry Wall and Orin Feagin.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Barnes in the \r\n  amount of $750,000.Â  Cohen appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 12, 1998, Cohen held its annual \r\n  Christmas party for its employees and their families.Â  As alcoholic beverages \r\n  were to be served at the party, Cohen Gaskins, the president of Cohen, hired \r\n  a professional bartender to verify guestsâ€™ identification before serving alcohol.Â  \r\n  During the party, Gaskins announced to the party guests that there were \r\n  police officers outside and that, if anyone had too much to drink, a ride home \r\n  would be provided.\r\nThe day before the party, a supervisor informed \r\n  Orin Feagin, a nineteen-year-old Cohen employee, that he would not be served \r\n  alcohol at the party.Â  Feagin stated he would bring his own bottle of \r\n  alcohol.Â  Although several Cohen employees observed Feagin with a bottle \r\n  of gin at the party, no one saw him drink from the bottle.Â  Only one \r\n  person testified he saw Feagin drink alcohol from the bar.Â  \r\nSeveral guests testified Feagin was loud and disruptive \r\n  at the party; however, others testified he behaved normally and did not act \r\n  as if he had been drinking.Â  Though Feagin left the party with a designated \r\n  driver, he drove out of the parking lot in his own vehicle.Â  After leaving \r\n  the party, Feagin visited his girlfriend at her place of employment, drove to \r\n  her motherâ€™s house, and then revisited his girlfriend.Â  Both the girlfriend \r\n  and her mother testified Feagin did not appear to be intoxicated.Â  A \r\n  short time later that evening, Feagin was involved in a two-car accident that \r\n  killed both him and the passenger in the other vehicle, Doris Barnes.Â  \r\nBarnes sued both Cohen and Feaginâ€™s estate, alleging, \r\n  among other things, that Cohen was negligent in serving alcoholic beverages \r\n  to Feagin at the party.Â  Feaginâ€™s estate asserted a cross-claim against \r\n  Cohen for negligence per se and gross negligence. \r\nAt the close of the evidence, Cohen unsuccessfully \r\n  moved for a directed verdict.Â  The jury returned a verdict against Cohen \r\n  and Feaginâ€™s estate for $750,000 in actual damages. \r\n  [1] Â  Cohen then moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, \r\n  new trial absolute, new trial nisi remittitur, new trial pursuant to the thirteenth-juror \r\n  doctrine, and alteration of the judgment to reflect a setoff of the amounts \r\n  paid by any or all of the insurance policies.Â  The trial court granted \r\n  only the last motion, holding â€œCohen Dry Wall is entitled to modify the judgment \r\n  to the extent of any liability insurance paid by the Defendant Feagin.â€\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nCohen argues that, under South Carolina law, â€œa \r\n  social host does not incur any liability to third parties when he serves alcohol \r\n  to his guestsâ€ and the trial court should therefore have granted its \r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  We disagree. \r\n  [2] \r\nIn support of this argument, Cohen relies on Garren \r\n  v. Cummings &amp; McCrady, Inc. [3] Â  This reliance is misplaced.Â  In Garren, \r\n  this court held that South Carolina did not recognize a third-party action against \r\n  a social host for serving alcohol to an adult guest.Â  This holding was based \r\n  on two determinations:Â  (1) South Carolina is â€œin accord with the general common \r\n  law view . . . that a social host incurs no liability to third parties when \r\n  he serves alcohol to his adult guestsâ€ [4]  and (2) no such liability was imposed by statute. \r\n  [5] Â  Neither of these circumstances applies to the present case.Â  \r\nHere, Barnes sought relief for losses allegedly resulting \r\n  from Cohenâ€™s allowing the consumption of alcohol by a minorâ€”rather than an adult \r\n  guest.Â  Even more important, however, is the fact that the South Carolina General \r\n  Assembly has enacted several statutes making it unlawful for â€œany person,â€ not \r\n  just commercial establishments, to provide alcohol to persons under the legal \r\n  drinking age. [6] Â  Moreover, although these statutes \r\n  specifically exempt certain situations, they do not exclude social hosts from \r\n  the prohibition, [7]  and as our supreme court has stated in Whitlaw v. Kroger, \r\n  such statutes â€œare designed to prevent harm to the minor who purchased the alcohol \r\n  and to members of the public harmed by the minorâ€™s consumption of that alcohol.â€ \r\n  [8] \r\nAlthough Whitlaw concerned the unauthorized sale of \r\n  alcohol to a minor by a commercial entity, we hold the supreme courtâ€™s statement \r\n  regarding the purpose of such statutory prohibitions is just as applicable to \r\n  the provision of alcohol by a social host to a guest who is under the legal \r\n  drinking age.Â  In so holding, we follow other jurisdictions that have recognized \r\n  civil causes of action against social hosts for serving alcohol to underage \r\n  individuals when such an act was in violation of a statute. \r\n  [9] \r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nCohen Dry Wall contends the trial court erred in allowing \r\n  Barnes to read excerpts of a deposition at trial, arguing Barnes did not meet \r\n  the burden of showing the witness was unavailable.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCounsel for Barnes informed the trial court that he intended \r\n  to read excerpts of a deposition at trial.Â  Counsel argued this was permitted \r\n  under Rule 32 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure because he could \r\n  not procure the witness by subpoena.Â  In support of this claim, counsel \r\n  submitted an affidavit of attempted service.Â  During the course of this \r\n  colloquy, the parties also discussed their belief that the deponent was incarcerated \r\n  in Columbia, which, according to Cohenâ€™s attorney, was less than 100 miles from \r\n  where the case was being tried.Â  Cohen now contends the trial court erred \r\n  in allowing the deposition testimony because it was not sufficiently established \r\n  that the deponent was either incarcerated or over 100 miles away.Â  \r\nAlthough the trial court did not make specific findings regarding \r\n  the deponentâ€™s whereabouts, such findings were unnecessary.Â  Barnes submitted \r\n  an affidavit of failed service of the subpoena on the deponent.Â  This was sufficient \r\n  under Rule 32(a)(3)(D) to allow the deposition to be read into evidence at trial. \r\n  [10] \r\nB.\r\nCohen further argues Barnes failed to \r\n  give the required notice of his intent to use the deposition in lieu of having \r\n  the witness testify.Â  In addition, Cohen contends that, even if the allowance \r\n  of the deposition had been proper, the trial court should have also allowed \r\n  the jury to be informed that the deponent was incarcerated when the case came \r\n  to trial.Â  \r\nThese arguments, however, were not set forth in \r\n  the Statement of Issues on Appeal in Cohenâ€™s brief; therefore, we decline to \r\n  address them. [11] Â  We further note that, with \r\n  regard to the trial courtâ€™s refusal to inform the jury that the deponent was \r\n  incarcerated, Cohen presented no argument on appeal either challenging the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s finding that the information was hearsay or supporting its admissibility \r\n  as a hearsay exception.\r\nIII.\r\nFinally, Cohen argues the trial court \r\n  erred in including in the jury charge language from South Carolina Code section \r\n  56-5-6110, known as the aiding and abetting statute.Â  Specifically, Cohen contends \r\n  that the reason the charge was error was that section 56-5-6110 is â€œnot relevant \r\n  to the issues raised by Barnesâ€™ allegations that Cohen Dry Wall provided and/or \r\n  served alcohol to a person under the age of twenty-oneâ€ because section 56-5-6110 \r\n  concerns aiding and abetting only those offenses within the same title and chapter, \r\n  whereas the offenses of providing alcohol to persons under the legal drinking \r\n  age are found in different parts of the code.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, when Barnes proffered the instruction, \r\n  Cohen argued the charge was improper because it would â€œ[supersede] the social \r\n  host immunityâ€ in that it would apply to serving visibly intoxicated adults \r\n  as well as minors. Â After the trial court charged the jury, Cohen made \r\n  only a general objection to the aiding and abetting charge, â€œjust to preserve \r\n  our position on the record.â€ \r\nWe have reviewed the record before us and do not \r\n  see a ruling by the trial court on the question of whether section 56-5-6110 \r\n  can be applied to the statutory prohibitions in Title 61 concerning serving \r\n  alcohol to a minor. Â Because the trial court did not have the opportunity \r\n  to rule on this particular issue, we likewise decline to address it on appeal. [12] \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  The jury also awarded punitive damages to Barnes against Feaginâ€™s \r\n    estate in the amount of $1,400,000, and no appeal was taken from this award.Â  \r\n    As to the claim of Feaginâ€™s estate against Cohen, the jury found Cohen was \r\n    20 per cent responsible for Feaginâ€™s death and Feagin was 80 per cent responsible.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Barnes argued in his brief that Cohen failed to preserve this argument \r\n    for appeal.Â  After examining the record in its entirety, however, we hold \r\n    Cohen sufficiently raised the issue before the trial court in order for us \r\n    to address it on appeal.Â  See State v.

Darling, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  In this action for contribution \r\n  arising from a prior negligence claim, the trial court awarded damages to G&amp;P \r\n  Trucking against Parks Auto Sales, Service, &amp; Salvage, Inc., in the amount \r\n  of Parks Autoâ€™s pro rata share of the common liability.Â  Parks Auto appeals.Â  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 12, 1999, Donald Finkey, a G&amp;P employee, while \r\n  operating a tractor-trailer at the salvage yard of Parks Auto, struck a guy \r\n  wire connected to a radio communications tower and caused the tower to fall. \r\n\r\nAfter the accident, G&amp;P entered into \r\n  settlements with four separate entities in connection with the collapse of the \r\n  tower.Â  Payments by G&amp;P pursuant to the settlements were as follows:Â  \r\n  (1) to Radio Communications of Charleston (RCC), the owner of the tower, G&amp;P \r\n  paid drafts totaling $200,000.00 on January 12, 1999, and March 29, 1999; \r\n  (2) to The Hartford, which insured RCC and had a right to subrogation for \r\n  payments made directly to RCC, G&amp;P paid $72,295.13 on September 1, 1999; \r\n  (3) to Wicks Broadcasting, which had equipment destroyed in the accident, \r\n  G&amp;P paid $94,181.17 on February 15, 2000; and (4) to Parks Auto itself, \r\n  G&amp;P paid $36,000.00 on November 10, 2000.Â  The total amount paid \r\n  by G&amp;P was $402,476.30.\r\nThe record on appeal indicates that, in \r\n  connection with the four settlements, G&amp;P obtained signed releases from \r\n  only RCC and Parks Auto.Â  The release from RCC states in pertinent part \r\n  that, in consideration of the sum paid by G&amp;P, RCC â€œremise[s], release[s] \r\n  and forever discharge[s] the said Zurich Insurance [G&amp;Pâ€™s insurer], G&amp;P \r\n  Trucking Company and Donald Finkey, their agents, servants, employees, executors, \r\n  adjusters, insurance companies, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, administrators, \r\n  successors, employees, and assigns.â€Â  The release executed by Parks Auto, \r\n  after acknowledging G&amp;P, Zurich, and Finkey as â€œPayers,â€ states that Parks \r\n  Auto â€œand its heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, release and forever \r\n  discharge said Payers, their executives, administrators, assigns, and all other \r\n  persons, firms, and corporations, both known and unknown.â€ \r\nBefore all the agreed-upon amounts were \r\n  paid in full, G&amp;P brought this claim against Parks Auto for contribution \r\n  under the South Carolina Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (the Act).Â  In \r\n  its complaint, dated January 31, 2000, G&amp;P alleged Parks Auto was negligent \r\n  in failing to warn of the guy wire and in maintaining its premises in an unreasonable \r\n  condition.Â  Parks Autoâ€™s answer, dated March 22, 2000, denied any and \r\n  all claims asserted by G&amp;P.Â  As of January 12, 2002, when the statute \r\n  of limitations had run on any claim arising from the underlying accident, the \r\n  case was still pending and no hearing had taken place. \r\nA hearing on the matter took place February \r\n  5 and 6, 2002.Â  The trial court, with the consent of counsel for both \r\n  sides, bifurcated the trial, allowing the jury to determine whether or not Parks \r\n  Auto was negligent, but reserving to itself the determination of whether Parks \r\n  Auto would be liable for contribution under the Act in the event the jury found \r\n  negligence.\r\nThe jury found Parks Auto negligently \r\n  and proximately caused damage or injury to G&amp;P.Â  Parks Auto immediately \r\n  moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new \r\n  trial on several grounds, namely, that (1) Parks Autoâ€™s liability was \r\n  not extinguished by the settlements, (2) Parks Auto had no duty to warn \r\n  of an open and obvious condition, and (3) Finkeyâ€™s intervening negligence \r\n  was the sole proximate cause of the accident.Â  The trial court denied \r\n  the motion and directed counsel to provide proposed orders on the nonjury issues, \r\n  with leave to reply to the other sideâ€™s order within five days thereafter.\r\nThe trial court found that â€œ[n]one of the settlements \r\n  fully compensated the parties for their loss.â€Â  Nevertheless, on June \r\n  14, 2002, the trial court issued an order granting G&amp;P judgment against \r\n  Parks Auto in the amount of $201,238.15.Â  This award was equal to half \r\n  the amount that G&amp;P had paid in connection with the accident. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Parks Auto argues that, because G&amp;P has \r\n  not met the extinguishment requirement in the Act, \r\n  [1]  it has no legal right to contribution.Â  We agree with this argument \r\n  insofar as it concerns the payments to RCC, The Hartford, and Wicks Broadcasting.\r\nâ€œThe common law rule against contribution \r\n  was abrogated in 1988 when our General Assembly enacted the South Carolina Uniform \r\n  Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act . . . .â€ \r\n  [2] Â  Because the Act is in derogation of the common law, it must be strictly \r\n  construed. [3] Â  Moreover, â€œ[i]n a suit in which \r\n  contribution is sought from a joint tortfeasor, the claimant obviously must \r\n  prove facts sufficient under the statutes and the common law of his own state \r\n  to establish a right to contribution between wrongdoers.â€ [4] \r\nSection 15-38-20(D) of the Act provides as follows:\r\n\r\nA tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant \r\n  is not entitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability \r\n  for the injury or wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement \r\n  nor in respect to any amount paid in a settlement which is in excess of what \r\n  was reasonable. [5] \r\n\r\nThe trial court held that section 15-38-20 is ambiguous \r\n  about whether a tortfeasor who has reached a settlement with the injured party \r\n  on the underlying tort could bring a contribution action after the statute of \r\n  limitations has run on the injured partyâ€™s claim against the joint tortfeasor \r\n  even if the settlement did not cover the injured partyâ€™s damages.Â  In reaching \r\n  this conclusion, the trial court noted that the terms â€œextinguishâ€ and â€œdischargeâ€ \r\n  are not defined within the statute for purposes of the Act.Â  The trial court \r\n  then found G&amp;P was entitled to contribution from Parks Auto based on Castillo \r\n  v. Roger Construction Co., [6]  in which the third circuit court of appeals \r\n  interpreted analogous sections of the Pennsylvania Contribution Among Tortfeasors \r\n  Act and gave the term â€œextinguishâ€ a liberal construction.\r\nWe, however, decline to follow Castillo \r\n  and note that later state cases in Pennsylvania have not adhered to this decision. \r\n  [7] Â  In addition, our review of case law from other jurisdictions indicates \r\n  the trial court incorrectly determined that section 15-38-20(D) is ambiguous. [8] Â  \r\nThe plain language of section 15-38-20(D) yields only one \r\n  interpretation, namely that extinguishment of the defending joint tortfeasorâ€™s \r\n  liability must have resulted directly from the settlement itself. [9] Â  We have found nothing in section \r\n  15-38-20, or, for that matter, any other part of the Act, that would suggest \r\n  that the running of the statute of limitations on an action arising from the \r\n  underlying tort would â€œextinguishâ€ a joint tortfeasorâ€™s liability so as to entitle \r\n  a settling tortfeasor to contribution. [10] Â  \r\nMoreover, we agree with Parks Autoâ€™s argument that the running \r\n  of the statute of limitations in and of itself cannot operate to â€œextinguishâ€ \r\n  a tortfeasorâ€™s liability. [11] Â  Although, as G&amp;P argues, a statute of limitations can \r\n  foreclose the right of a claimant to file suit, unlike a statute of repose, \r\n  it is subject to certain counter-assertions, such as waiver, tolling, and estoppel. [12] \r\nIn the present case, there was no evidence of a release \r\n  that would discharge any liability of Parks Auto for claims asserted by The \r\n  Hartford or Wicks Broadcasting.Â  With regard to the agreement executed in connection \r\n  with G&amp;Pâ€™s payment to RCC, that document purported to release only G&amp;P \r\n  and any related entities.Â  None of these three claimants, then, agreed that \r\n  the payments received from G&amp;P relieved Parks Auto of liability in the underlying \r\n  tort. [13] Â  \r\nGiven both the absence of a release as to Parks Auto and \r\n  the unappealed finding by the trial court that none of the payments by G&amp;P \r\n  fully compensated any of the injured parties for their losses, we hold that, \r\n  as a matter of law, G&amp;P has failed to establish entitlement to contribution \r\n  from Parks Auto under the South Carolina Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors \r\n  Act.\r\n2.Â  Although the agreement executed by Parks Auto in \r\n  connection with the payment it received from G&amp;P released â€œall other persons, \r\n  firms, and corporations, both known and unknown,â€ we agree with Parks Auto that \r\n  G&amp;P cannot obtain contribution under the Act for this particular claim because \r\n  Parks Auto, the only alleged tortfeasor other than G&amp;P, was also the injured \r\n  party and, as such, could not have been a tortfeasor as to its own injury, let \r\n  alone a joint tortfeasor. [14]  Because Parks Auto was not \r\n  a joint tortfeasor in this particular instance, there was no â€œcommon liability.â€Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we reject G&amp;Pâ€™s argument that, notwithstanding \r\n  Parks Autoâ€™s status as the injured party, the award should be upheld because \r\n  G&amp;P had a contractual right under the agreement to â€œseek and pursue indemnity \r\n  and/or contribution rights for all monies paid herein or otherwise.â€Â  Without \r\n  question, G&amp;P had this right and exercised it.Â  With respect to all four \r\n  payments, including that made to Parks Auto, however, G&amp;P requested only \r\n  contributionâ€”and not indemnity.Â  Because there was no common liability on which \r\n  to base a claim for contribution for payment of Parks Autoâ€™s own damages, G&amp;P \r\n  was not entitled to this relief for this particular claim. \r\n  [15]  Â We therefore hold that, with respect to G&amp;Pâ€™s payment of compensation \r\n  to Parks Auto, the trial court was incorrect in granting G&amp;Pâ€™s request for \r\n  contribution.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n3.Â  Because our holding on G&amp;Pâ€™s right to contribution \r\n  is dispositive of this appeal, we do not address Parks Autoâ€™s argument that \r\n  it was entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of negligence.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  S.C.

Calhoun, Jr., both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  United Services Automobile \r\n  Association (â€œUSAAâ€) brought this declaratory judgment action against Lesli \r\n  Litchfield and Vernon Litchfield seeking a declaration that no basis exists \r\n  for reforming Lesli Litchfieldâ€™s automobile insurance policy to include underinsured \r\n  motorist (â€œUIMâ€) coverage.Â  The trial court granted USAAâ€™s motion for summary \r\n  judgment. The Litchfields appeal, contending USAA failed to make a meaningful \r\n  offer of UIM coverage.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nUSAA sent Lesli Litchfield (then Lesli Tillman) \r\n  an automobile insurance policy on July 9, 1997.Â  USAA included an offer of UIM, \r\n  using form 333SC(10), a form prescribed by the Chief Insurance Commissioner \r\n  of South Carolina.Â  This form listed each and every limit of UIM coverage that \r\n  USAA had filed with and had been approved to sell by the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Insurance, instructed Litchfield how to select UIM coverage if she wished \r\n  it, and told her how she could later increase or decrease the limits of such \r\n  coverage.Â  The coversheet of the policy contained the following notice: â€œImportant \r\n  Notice!Â  SC law requires us to add . . . UIM to your policy in the same limits \r\n  as your liability unless you sign the attached offer of optional . . . UIM Form \r\n  333SC and return it to us within 30 days.â€\r\nWhen Litchfield failed to respond, USAA issued her \r\n  a policy on August 19, 1997, that included UIM coverage in the amount of her \r\n  liability coverage.Â  Six months later, Litchfield telephoned USAA and asked \r\n  that it drop the UIM coverage from her policy.\r\nUSAA sent her a form annotated with the words â€œRejection \r\n  of UIM per phone conversationâ€ written across the bottom and asked her to sign, \r\n  date, and return it by mail.Â  Litchfield did so, returning the form on February \r\n  2, 1998.Â  USAA then prepared and sent to Litchfield an amended declaration that \r\n  reflected the deletion of the UIM coverage and the prorated, decreased premium \r\n  for the remainder of the policy period.\r\nOn October 5, 1999, while driving a rented automobile \r\n  in Hawaii, Litchfieldâ€™s husband was injured in a motor vehicle collision.Â  Litchfieldâ€™s \r\n  husband then presented a claim for UIM benefits against her USAA policy because \r\n  the damages he sustained allegedly exceed the $100,000.00 liability coverage \r\n  of the at-fault driver.\r\nUSAA instituted this declaratory judgment action \r\n  against the Litchfields, asserting Litchfield had effectively cancelled her \r\n  UIM coverage.Â  The latter counterclaimed, seeking to have the policy reformed \r\n  to include the UIM that Litchfield, almost two years previously, had specifically \r\n  asked be deleted from her policy.\r\nThe trial court granted USAA summary judgment, \r\n  finding the sole reason that Litchfieldâ€™s policy did not contain UIM coverage \r\n  at the time of the accident was because she had voluntarily elected to drop \r\n  it.Â  The Litchfields do not challenge this finding on appeal.Â  The Litchfields \r\n  claim that USAA did not make a valid offer of optional UIM coverage when she \r\n  purchased her coverage. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe do not view this as an â€œoffer of UIM coverageâ€ \r\n  case. [1] Â  We are beyond the point of having to decide \r\n  whether USAA made a valid offer of UIM coverage to Litchfield.Â  This is because \r\n  Litchfield did in fact enjoy such coverage and in an amount up to the limits \r\n  of her liability coverage; however, she later, on her own initiative, voluntarily \r\n  decided to drop it.Â  Because Litchfield once had UIM coverage and later changed \r\n  the policy by dropping the UIM coverage from her policy, USAA was under no obligation \r\n  to make another offer of UIM coverage. \r\n  [2] Â  Moreover, we agree with the trial court that â€œ[i]t would make no sense \r\n  . . . for an insurer to be required to â€˜offerâ€™ a given coverage to an insured \r\n  who had contacted the insurance company for the specific purpose of dropping \r\n  that coverage.â€\r\nIndeed, if Litchfield were allowed to prevail in \r\n  this instance, then anyone whose policy currently includes UIM coverage in an \r\n  amount less than his or her liability coverage would be able to question later \r\n  the sufficiency of the offer of UIM coverage and seek to have the policy reformed \r\n  in an attempt to increase the limits thereof.Â  The opportunity for fraud would \r\n  be enormous.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nStILWELL, J., concurs.Â  HUFF, J., dissents \r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nHUFF, J. (dissenting) :Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion affirming the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision.Â  The trial court granted USAAâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The \r\n  Litchfields appeal.Â  I believe the main issue on appeal concerns whether USAA \r\n  made a valid offer of UIM coverage.Â  I would hold that USAA did not make a valid \r\n  offer and reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn light of the fact that a determination as to \r\n  the existence of a valid offer is critical to this case I find it necessary \r\n  to provide a separate factual statement.Â  In July 1997, USAA issued an automobile \r\n  insurance policy to Lesli Litchfield, then known as Lesli Tillman, effective \r\n  July 10, 1997 through January 10, 1998.Â  The policy did not include UIM coverage.Â  \r\n  The automobile policy packet sent to Litchfield did, however, include an offer \r\n  of UIM coverage.Â  The offer provided, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nYour automobile insurance policy \r\n  does not provide any underinsured motorists coverage.Â  You have, however, a \r\n  right to buy underinsured motorists coverage in limits up to the limits of liability \r\n  coverage you carry under your automobile insurance policy.Â  Limits of underinsured \r\n  motorists coverage, together with the additional premiums you will be charged \r\n  are shown upon this Form. \r\n\r\nThe policy coversheet and the UIM offer both indicated \r\n  that, if the offer form was not completed and returned within thirty days, UIM \r\n  coverage would automatically be added to the policy at the same limits as Litchfieldâ€™s \r\n  liability limits, as required by law.Â  \r\nThe offer form gave the option of purchasing or \r\n  rejecting UIM coverage, and listed ten levels of bodily injury limits ranging \r\n  from $15,000/$30,000 to $1,000,000/$1,000,000 and seven levels of property damage \r\n  limits ranging from $5,000 to $500,000.Â  To select the desired levels of coverage \r\n  the applicant had to check the boxes next to the appropriate limits.Â  The parties \r\n  do not dispute that USAAâ€™s offer form listed every limit of UIM coverage USAA \r\n  is authorized by the South Carolina Department of Insurance to sell.Â  \r\nLitchfield did not respond to \r\n  the initial offer of UIM coverage, so on August 19, 1997 USAA automatically \r\n  added the coverage to her policy, effective July 10, 1997.Â  On January 26, 1998, \r\n  Litchfield telephoned USAA and asked that the UIM coverage be dropped from her \r\n  policy.Â  USAA informed Litchfield that, to properly document her request, it \r\n  needed to have a statement in writing.Â  USAA sent Litchfield a standard form \r\n  offer of underinsured motorist coverage with the handwritten annotation â€œRejection \r\n  of UIM per phone conversation.â€Â  Litchfield promptly executed the form declining \r\n  coverage and mailed it back to USAA.Â  Shortly thereafter, USAA prepared and \r\n  sent Litchfield an Amended Declaration, reflecting the deletion of the UIM coverage.Â  \r\n\r\nOn October 5, 1999, Litchfieldâ€™s husband, Vernon \r\n  Litchfield, was seriously injured in an automobile collision in Hawaii.Â  The \r\n  liability carrier for the at-fault vehicle tendered its limits of liability \r\n  coverage.Â  Mr. Litchfield subsequently presented a claim for UIM benefits against \r\n  his wifeâ€™s USAA policy, asserting the policy should be reformed to include $50,000 \r\n  in UIM coverage because USAA failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage.Â  \r\n\r\nUSAA denied there was any UIM coverage, asserting \r\n  that Lesli Litchfield had changed her policy to delete UIM coverage and USAA \r\n  was not required to make any further UIM offers following the change.Â  The Litchfields \r\n  sought reformation of the policy to include UIM coverage on the grounds that \r\n  USAA failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to USAA \r\n  finding that the sole reason the policy did not provide UIM coverage at the \r\n  time of the accident was that Litchfield voluntarily elected to drop it, and \r\n  USAA was not required to offer Litchfield that same coverage when she telephoned \r\n  them requesting that UIM coverage be deleted.Â  The court further found that \r\n  the form offering UIM coverage sent to Litchfield in July 1997, when her policy \r\n  was initially issued, complied with South Carolina law such that the offer was \r\n  meaningful and effective.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Litchfields assert that USAAâ€™s offer of UIM \r\n  coverage was not a meaningful offer under South Carolina law, and because no \r\n  meaningful offer was made to Mrs. Litchfield, it is irrelevant that she rejected \r\n  the UIM coverage. [3] Â  I agree.\r\nIn finding USAA was not required to offer Mrs. \r\n  Litchfield UIM coverage after she elected to drop the coverage, the trial court \r\n  relied on Â§ 38-77-350(C) of the South Carolina Code, governing the offer of \r\n  optional coverages.Â  This section provides, â€œAn automobile insurer is not required \r\n  to make a new offer of coverage on any automobile insurance policy which renews, \r\n  extends, changes, supercedes, or replaces an existing policy.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38-77-350 (C) (2002).Â  It is clear, however, that this subsection envisions \r\n  that an effective past offer has already been made.Â  See Antley v. \r\n  Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 621, 635, 567 S.E.2d 872, 879-80 (Ct. App. 2002) \r\n  (while an insurer is not required to make a new offer of optional coverage where \r\n  the policy renews an existing policy, the insurer still bears the burden of \r\n  demonstrating a meaningful offer of the optional coverage was made at some point \r\n  in the past);Â  McDonald v. S.C. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 120, 125, \r\n  518 S.E.2d 624, 626 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œWhere Section 38-77-350(C) states the \r\n  insured is not required to make a â€˜newâ€™ offer, it clearly envisions the circumstances \r\n  where the insurer has already made an â€˜oldâ€™ offer.â€);Â  Ackerman v. Travelers \r\n  Indem. Co., 318 S.C. 137, 142, 456 S.E.2d 408, 411 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œ[T]he \r\n  only reasonable way to interpret the language in Â§ 38-77-350(C) is to recognize \r\n  that the insurer may rely on the effective past offers it has given to \r\n  its insureds when these insureds continue coverage with the same insurer.â€) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â Â Â  \r\nWe thus turn to the question of whether USAA made \r\n  a meaningful offer to Litchfield in the past.Â  The Litchfields argue USAAâ€™s \r\n  offer did not comply with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) \r\n  and pertinent South Carolina case law.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 38-77-160 requires automobile insurance \r\n  carriers to offer, at the option of the insured, UIM coverage â€œup to the limits \r\n  of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the event that damages \r\n  are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by an at-fault insured \r\n  or underinsured motorist.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  This statute \r\n  has been construed to mandate that the insured â€œbe provided with adequate information, \r\n  and in such a manner, as to allow the insured to make an intelligent decision \r\n  of whether to accept or reject the coverage.â€Â  Burch v. S.C. Farm Bureau \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 342, 345, 569 S.E.2d 400, 402 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting \r\n  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987)).Â  Specifically, our courts have interpreted this section \r\n  as requiring insurers to offer UIM coverage to the insured in any amount \r\n  up to the insuredâ€™s liability coverage.Â  Id. at 345, 569 S.E.2d at 402.\r\nTo determine whether an insurer has complied with \r\n  its duty to offer optional coverages and thus make a meaningful offer of UIM \r\n  coverage, the court must consider the following factors: (1) the insurerâ€™s notification \r\n  process must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the \r\n  insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional \r\n  coverage in general terms; (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured \r\n  of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be told that \r\n  optional coverages are available for an additional premium. Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556.\r\nThe insurer bears the burden of establishing it \r\n  presented a meaningful offer of UIM coverage.Â  Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., \r\n  323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 759 (1996).Â  If the insurer fails to make \r\n  a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, the court will reform the insuredâ€™s policy \r\n  to include UIM coverage up to the limits of the insuredâ€™s liability coverage.Â  \r\n  Dewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 296 S.C. 150, 153, 370 S.E.2d \r\n  915, 916 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  A noncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer \r\n  at all.Â  Hanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 55, 57, 389 \r\n  S.E.2d 657, 659 (1990).\r\nUSAA claims its offer of UIM coverage satisfied \r\n  the requirements for a meaningful offer because its form listed every level \r\n  of coverage the company was authorized by the South Carolina Department of Insurance \r\n  to sell.Â  I disagree.\r\nIn Bower v. National General Insurance Co., \r\n  our supreme court ruled that an offer of UIM coverage must inform the insured \r\n  â€œthat any limits up to the liability limits could be purchased.â€ 351 \r\n  S.C. 112, 119, 569 S.E.2d 313, 316 (2002) (emphasis in original).Â  In that case, \r\n  the insurerâ€™s offer form stated, in language virtually identical to the language \r\n  in USAAâ€™s form, that the insured had the â€œright to buy underinsured motorist \r\n  coverage in limits up to the limits of liability coverage you will carry under \r\n  your automobile insurance policy.â€Â  The form further provided, â€œThe limits of \r\n  underinsured motorist coverage, together with the additional premiums you will \r\n  be charged, are shown upon this Form.â€ Id. at 114-15, 569 S.E.2d at 314.Â  \r\n  The form listed four bodily injury limits and fourÂ  property damage limits with \r\n  the applicable premiums.Â  Id. at 115, 569 S.E.2d at 314.Â  The form then \r\n  included blank spaces to fill in requested UIM bodily injury limits and UIM \r\n  property damage limits.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court concluded, because the \r\n  language of National Generalâ€™s form failed to inform the insured that UIM coverage \r\n  in any amount up to the insuredâ€™s liability coverage could be purchased, \r\n  the offer could not be considered meaningful. Id. at 119, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  at 316.Â  Though the form did not explicitly state that â€œallâ€ of the available \r\n  limits of UIM coverage were listed, the court found that a reasonable person \r\n  would conclude that the options listed were the only ones available. Id. \r\n  at 118, 569 S.E.2d at 316.\r\nAs in Bower, the offer of UIM coverage in \r\n  the instant case did not inform Litchfield of her right to purchase the coverage \r\n  in any amount up to the limits of her liability coverage.Â  The supreme \r\n  court in Bower clearly held that the offer must â€œinform an insured that \r\n  â€˜underinsured motorist coverage in any amount up to the insuredâ€™s liability \r\n  coverageâ€™ is what is actually being offered.â€Â  Id. at 119, 569 S.E.2d \r\n  at 316 (emphasis in original).Â  USAAâ€™s form failed to provide this explicit \r\n  information to the insured, listing only the fixed levels of coverage it had \r\n  obtained authorization from the Department of Insurance to sell.\r\nUSAA argues Bower is distinguishable because, \r\n  unlike USAAâ€™s offer, the UIM coverage offer at issue in Bower only listed \r\n  examples of the levels of coverage, not all of the limits the insurer was authorized \r\n  to sell.Â  We find a careful reading of Bower shows no distinction between \r\n  the two cases, asÂ  Bower specifically relied on this courtâ€™s decision \r\n  in Wilkes v. Freeman, 334 S.C. 206, 512 S.E.2d 530 (Ct. App. 1999). In \r\n  Wilkes, this courtÂ  found a meaningful offer of UIM coverage was not \r\n  made where, as in the present case, the offer form listed all of the \r\n  limits the insurer was authorized to sell.Â  The offer of UIM coverage in Wilkes \r\n  stated that â€œ[a]ll of the limits of underinsured motor vehicle coverage \r\n  we sell, together with the additional premiums you will be charged, are shown \r\n  on this form.â€Â  Id. at 210, 512 S.E.2d at 532 (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n  Although the insurerâ€™s offer form listed all the limits of UIM coverage the \r\n  insurer sold, the court found that the form failed â€œto provide any indication \r\n  that applicants may request other coverage amounts.â€ Id.Â  Because the \r\n  insurer failed to provide the insured an opportunity to request UIM coverage \r\n  at alternate coverage amounts, the insurer failed to â€œoffer UIM coverage â€˜up \r\n  toâ€™ the limits of [the insuredâ€™s] liability coverage.â€Â  Id. at 212, 512 \r\n  S.E.2d at 533.  [4] \r\nI am mindful that, by explicitly listing each level \r\n  of UIM coverage it was authorized to sell, USAA was likely attempting to make \r\n  the insuredâ€™s choice of UIM coverage limits easier rather than more difficult \r\n  to understand.Â  I am constrained, however, by recent precedent which requires \r\n  that an offer of UIM coverage clearly inform the insured that UIM coverage may \r\n  be purchased in any amount up to the limits of liability coverage.Â  No \r\n  exception has been carved out for cases such as the present, in which the offer \r\n  lists every limit of UIM coverage the insurer is legally authorized to sell.Â  \r\n  As noted above, our courts declined to provide for such an exception when those \r\n  circumstances arose in the Wilkes case.Â  \r\nBased on the standing case law, I would hold USAAâ€™s \r\n  offer of UIM coverage did not sufficiently inform Mrs. Litchfield of her right \r\n  to purchase UIM coverage in any amount, and I am thus compelled to rule the \r\n  offer was not meaningful.Â  I would reverse the trial courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  summary judgment and remand the case with the instruction that Mrs. Litchfieldâ€™s \r\n  USAA policy be reformed to include UIM coverage at the appropriate limits.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Because we do not consider this \r\n    an â€œofferâ€ case, we do not reach the issue of whether the offer made by USAA \r\n    to Litchfield was valid to begin with.Â  Cf., however, Norwood v. \r\n    Allstate Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 503, 506-507, 489 S.E.2d 661, 663 (Ct. App. \r\n    1997) (holding an automobile insurer made a valid offer of UIM coverage under \r\n    a policy with liability limits of 25/50/25 where insured offered UIM coverage \r\n    of 15/30/5, 15/30/10, and 25/50/10, and offer form indicated insured could \r\n    purchase UIM coverage â€œup toâ€ her liability limits and instructed her how \r\n    to increase or decrease her limits of UIM coverage); cf. also \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-470 (Supp. 2002) (â€œThere is no requirement for an insurer \r\n    or an agent to offer underinsured motorist coverage at limits less than the \r\n    statutorily required bodily injury or property damage limits.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(c) (2002) (â€œAn automobile insurer \r\n    is not required to make a new offer of coverage on any automobile insurance \r\n    policy which renews, extends, changes, supersedes, or replaces an existing \r\n    policy.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] USAA asserts the Litchfields failed to address the trial courtâ€™s finding \r\n    â€œthat the sole reason that [Mrs. Litchfieldâ€™s] policy did not provide coverage \r\n    at the time of the accident was that she had voluntarily elected to drop it.â€Â  \r\n    It therefore contends the Litchfields have abandoned this issue.Â  However, \r\n    after review of the Litchfieldsâ€™ brief, I find they have sufficiently challenged \r\n    this ruling by maintaining that Mrs. Litchfieldâ€™s rejection or deletion of \r\n    the UIM coverage is irrelevant because there was no meaningful offer made \r\n    by USAA in the first instance. Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] It should further be noted that, unlike the form in this case, the \r\n    form in Bower included a blank space for the insured to specify the \r\n    exact limits the insured desired.Â  The Bower dissent partially relied \r\n    upon this distinction in maintaining that a meaningful offer of UIM coverage \r\n    was made.Â  Bower, 351 S.C. at 121, 569 S.E.2d at 317.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3713","title":"State  v.

Taggart, of the South Carolina Office of \r\n  Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for the Appellant. \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson; \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown;Â  and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â  Jeremy Bryson was \r\n  indicted and tried for multiple charges, including assaulting a law enforcement \r\n  officer while resisting arrest in violation of South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 16-9-320(B) (2003) and pointing a firearm in violation of South Carolina \r\n  Code Annotated section 16-23-410 (2003).Â  On appeal, Bryson argues the circuit \r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction for these two offenses because the \r\n  court allowed the amendment of both indictments immediately prior to trial, \r\n  changing the identity of the law enforcement officer named as the victim in \r\n  each.Â  We agree with Bryson and vacate the two convictions.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nJeremy Bryson and a co-defendant robbed a man and \r\n  woman at gunpoint.Â  Bryson and the co-defendant then forced the female victim \r\n  into a vehicle where the victim was sexually assaulted by Bryson while the co-defendant \r\n  pointed a gun at her. \r\nShortly after the female victim was released, \r\n  law enforcement officers initiated a chase of the vehicle in which Bryson was \r\n  riding.Â  The chase ended when the co-defendant wrecked the vehicle.Â  Bryson \r\n  exited the vehicle carrying a gun.Â  After a brief struggle with Deputies Richardson \r\n  and Brantly, Bryson was arrested.\r\nThe arrest warrant for assaulting an officer while resisting \r\n  arrest listed both deputies as assaulted officers, and the arrest warrant for \r\n  pointing a firearm listed both as victims.Â  However, the indictments for these \r\n  two charges list only Deputy Richardson and read as follows:Â  \r\nRESISTING ARREST â€“ ASSAULT ON OFFICERÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nThat Jeremy Bryson did in Richland County on or about April \r\n  25, 2000, knowingly and willfully assault, beat or wound one M.S. Richardson, \r\n  RCSD, a law enforcement officer of this State, while resisting the efforts \r\n  of the said officer to make a lawful arrest of the said defendant, in violation \r\n  of Â§ 16-9-320(b), Code of Laws of South Carolina, (1976), as amended.Â  \r\n.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  .\r\n\r\nPOINTING A FIREARM\r\n\r\nThat Jeremy Bryson did in Richland County on or about April \r\n  25, 2000, point or present a firearm, to wit: Beta Arms .380 Caliber Pistol \r\n  SN#B08830 at one Deputy Micah Richardson.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nBefore jury selection, the state moved to amend \r\n  each indictment by substituting Deputy Brantly for Deputy Richardson as the \r\n  officer against whom the offense was committed. \r\n  [1] Â Bryson objected to the amendments, asserting the changes would deprive \r\n  him of notice of what he was required to defend. Â The circuit court allowed \r\n  the amendments, ruling the change of the victimâ€™s name did not change the nature \r\n  of the offenses charged. \r\nBryson was also indicted and simultaneously \r\n  tried for the other charges stemming from his conduct on the day of his arrest, \r\n  including kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, possession \r\n  of a pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one, carrying a pistol, and \r\n  two counts of armed robbery. [2] Â  \r\n\r\nBryson was convicted of all charges except the \r\n  charge of assaulting an officer while resisting an arrest.Â  On this charge, \r\n  the jury found Bryson guilty of the lesser-included offense of resisting arrest. \r\n  [3]   \r\nBryson was sentenced to thirty-year concurrent terms \r\n  for kidnapping, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, and for each of \r\n  the two counts of armed robbery.Â  He was sentenced to one year in prison for \r\n  carrying a pistol and resisting arrest, to run concurrently with the thirty-year \r\n  sentences.Â  He was sentenced to five-years imprisonment each for possession \r\n  of a firearm and pointing a firearm, both to run consecutively to the thirty-year \r\n  concurrent sentences.Â  Bryson appeals his convictions for resisting arrest and \r\n  pointing a firearm.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject Matter Jurisdiction for Assaulting an Officer\r\nwhile Resisting Arrest\r\nBryson argues the circuit court \r\n  did not have subject matter jurisdiction to try him for assaulting an officer \r\n  while resisting arrest. [4] Â  We agree and vacate his conviction for the \r\n  lesser-included offense of resisting arrest.\r\nThe subject matter jurisdiction of a court is fundamental \r\n  and can be raised at any time.Â  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 346, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d 846, 848-49 (2001). \r\nA trial court acquires subject matter jurisdiction to hear \r\n  a criminal case by way of a legally sufficient indictment or a valid waiver \r\n  thereof. State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 424 (1999); \r\n  see S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11 (Supp. 2002) (stating â€œ[n]o person may be \r\n  held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over which is not within the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  court, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury of the county where \r\n  the crime has been committedâ€).Â  \r\nAn amendment to a legally sufficient indictment does not \r\n  divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction so long as the amendment \r\n  does not change the nature of the offense charged.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-19-100 (2003) (â€œIf . . . there be any defect in form in anyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  indictments \r\n  . . . the court before which the trial shall be had may amend the indictment \r\n  . . . if such amendment does not change the nature of the offense charged . \r\n  . . [; however, if] such amendment shall operate as a surprise to the defendant, \r\n  . . . the defendant shall be entitled, upon demand, to a continuance of the \r\n  cause.â€).\r\nConversely, an amendment to an indictment that changes the \r\n  nature of the offense charged or charges a different offense divests the trial \r\n  court of subject matter jurisdiction. 41 Am. Jur.2d Indictments and Informations \r\n  Â§ 174 (1995) (â€œAn indictment is impermissibly amended if the altered indictment \r\n  charges a different offense or changes the nature of the offense.â€); State \r\n  v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 640-41, 545 S.E.2d 511, 514 (2001) (holding the \r\n  nature of the offense changed when an indictment for first-degree burglary was \r\n  amended to change the aggravating circumstance from entering during darkness \r\n  to causing physical injury because â€œthe proof required for each aggravating \r\n  circumstance [was] materially differentâ€); Hopkins v. State, 317 S.C. \r\n  7, 9, 451 S.E.2d 389, 390 (1994) (holding the nature of the offense changed \r\n  because the amendment to the indictment increased the maximum penalty for the \r\n  crime); State v. Riddle, 301 S.C. 211, 212, 391 S.E.2d 253, 253 (1990) \r\n  (holding the nature of the offense was changed when an indictment was amended \r\n  from assault with intent to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct to assault \r\n  with intent to commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct because the punishment \r\n  for the amended offense was different from the punishment for the original offense); \r\n  State v. Sowell, 85 S.C. 278, 283-84, 67 S.E. 316, 317-19 (1910) (holding \r\n  when an amendment to an indictment substituted a different and distinct offense \r\n  from the one charged, the trial court is divested of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because the grand jury had not indicted the defendant on the substituted offense); \r\n  see also State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 132-36, 437 S.E.2d 75, 80-82 \r\n  (1993) (holding the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by an indictment is \r\n  limited to the charged offense).\r\nAfter carefully considering the indictment in this \r\n  case, we conclude the amendment replaced the properly indicted count of assaulting \r\n  an officer while resisting arrest with a second unindicted count of the same \r\n  crime.Â  Our analysis is predicated on the wording of South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 16-9-320(B).Â  That section states: â€œIt is unlawful for a person to knowingly \r\n  and willfully . . . assault, beat, or wound an officer when the person is resisting \r\n  an arrest being made by one whom the person knows or reasonably should know \r\n  is a law enforcement officer, whether under process or not.â€ S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-9-320(B).\r\nCriminal statutes are â€œconstrued strictly against the \r\n  state and in favor of the defendant.â€Â  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, \r\n  273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991).Â  However, â€œ[i]f a statuteâ€™s language is plain \r\n  and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need \r\n  to employ rules of statutory interpretation . . . . When the terms of a statute \r\n  are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 366-67, 574 S.E.2d 203, 206-07 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002) (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe statute plainly states that one of the elements \r\n  of assaulting an officer while resisting arrest is that â€œan officerâ€ be assaulted.Â  \r\n  Because â€œanâ€ is an article that modifies a singular noun, the plain language \r\n  of the statute indicates the crime involves an assault on one officer. See \r\n  Websterâ€™s Third New Intâ€™l Dictionary 75 (1986).Â  Thus, if two officers \r\n  are assaulted, beaten or wounded in the course of the arrest, two separate violations \r\n  of section 16-9-320(B) are committed. \r\n  [5] Â  See State v. Maybank, 352 S.C. 310, 313-14, 573 S.E.2d \r\n  851, 853 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œAfter the officers told Maybank he was under arrest, \r\n  . . . Maybank engaged in several brief fights with [two officers] . . . and \r\n  [was] later indicted for . . . two counts of assaulting a police officer while \r\n  resisting arrest.â€); see also State v. Hollman, 232 S.C. 489, \r\n  503, 102 S.E.2d 873, 880 (1958) (holding a single act constitutes two separate \r\n  offenses when â€œthere are distinct elements in one offense which are not included \r\n  in the otherâ€), revâ€™d on other grounds by, Stevenson v. State, \r\n  335 S.C. 193, 516 S.E.2d 434 (1999) (overruling Hollmanâ€™s holding by \r\n  deciding that convictions for both assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\n  nature and resisting arrest do not constitute a double jeopardy violation).\r\nIn the present case, Bryson was the passenger in \r\n  a vehicle involved in a high-speed chase.Â  After the vehicle wrecked, Bryson \r\n  exited the vehicle and fought with several sheriffâ€™s deputies who subsequently \r\n  arrested Bryson. Â The arrest warrant listed Deputies Richardson and Brantly \r\n  as assaulted officers.Â  Based on the plain language of the statute and the facts \r\n  as alleged by the state, Bryson could have been indicted for two counts of assaulting \r\n  an officer while resisting arrest.\r\nInstead, Bryson was indicted for one count of assaulting \r\n  an officer while resisting arrest, with the indictment listing Deputy Richardson \r\n  as the assaulted officer.Â  At the time the grand jury convened, the state did \r\n  not indict Bryson for the additional count of assaulting Deputy Brantly.Â  \r\nHowever, before jury selection, the state moved \r\n  to amend the indictment to substitute the unindicted charge listing Deputy Brantly \r\n  as the assaulted officer for the indicted charge listing Deputy Richardson as \r\n  the assaulted officer.Â  The circuit court permitted the amendment. \r\nBecause the amendment substituted a different charge from \r\n  the one presented to the grand jury, we hold the amendment divested the circuit \r\n  court of subject matter jurisdiction to try Bryson for assaulting an officer \r\n  while resisting arrest. [6]  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (stating it is only when an amendment to an indictment \r\n  does not change the nature of the offense charged that the amendment does not \r\n  divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction); see also S.C. \r\n  Const. art. I, Â§ 11 (stating â€œ[n]o person may be held to answer for any crime \r\n  the jurisdiction over which is not within the magistrateâ€™s court, unless on \r\n  a presentment or indictment of a grand jury of the county where the crime has \r\n  been committedâ€).\r\nBecause the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to try Bryson on the amended indictment for assaulting Deputy Brantly while \r\n  resisting arrest, the court lacked jurisdiction to convict Bryson for the lesser-included \r\n  offense of resisting arrest. See Ritter, 296 S.C. at 53, 370 S.E.2d \r\n  at 610-11 (holding resisting arrest is a lesser-included offense of assaulting \r\n  an officer while resisting arrest).\r\nThe line of cases that state the circuit court has subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction over a lesser-included offense for which the defendant was \r\n  convicted involve instances where the indictment setting out the greater offense \r\n  was valid. State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 579-81, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105-06 \r\n  (2002) (holding the circuit court had jurisdiction over the lesser-included \r\n  offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, where a valid \r\n  indictment for first-degree criminal sexual conduct existed); Joseph v. State, \r\n  351 S.C. 551, 555-58, 571 S.E.2d 280, 282-83 (2002) (holding the circuit court \r\n  did not have subject matter jurisdiction for grand larceny, even though there \r\n  was a valid indictment for robbery, because grand larceny is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of robbery).Â  Thus, we conclude the conviction for the lesser-included \r\n  offense of resisting arrest must be vacated. \r\nII. Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Subject Matter Jurisdiction for Pointing a Firearm\r\nBryson argues the circuit court did \r\n  not have subject matter jurisdiction to try him for pointing a firearm.Â  We \r\n  agree and vacate his conviction on this charge.\r\nThe analysis of the subject matter jurisdiction conferred \r\n  by the amended indictment for the charge of pointing a firearm is the same as \r\n  the analysis discussed for assaulting an officer while resisting arrest in the \r\n  preceding section.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 16-23-410 states: \r\n  â€œIt is unlawful for a person to present or point at another person a loaded \r\n  or unloaded firearm.â€Â  The clear wording of this statute makes it illegal to \r\n  point a firearm at a person.Â  The offense is not defined as pointing a firearm \r\n  at â€œone or more persons.â€Â  It follows that if the defendant points a firearm \r\n  at two people, two separate offenses are committed. Morgan, 352 S.C. \r\n  at 367, 574 S.E.2d at 207 (â€œWhen the terms of a statute are clear, the court \r\n  must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€).\r\nHere, Bryson exited a wrecked vehicle holding a gun.Â  He \r\n  pointed this gun at the officers who subsequently arrested him.Â  The arrest \r\n  warrant listed both Deputies Richardson and Brantly as the victims of Brysonâ€™s \r\n  pointing a firearm.Â  Based on the plain language of the statute and the facts \r\n  alleged by the state, Bryson could have been indicted for two charges of pointing \r\n  a firearm.Â  However, Bryson was only indicted on one charge that listed Deputy \r\n  Richardson as the victim. Â Prior to trial, the circuit court allowed \r\n  an amendment to the indictment that substituted the unindicted charge listing \r\n  Deputy Brantly as the victim for the indicted charge listing Deputy Richardson \r\n  as the victim.Â  For the same reasons as set forth in the preceding section, \r\n  the circuit court was without jurisdiction to try or convict Bryson for pointing \r\n  a firearm at Deputy Brantly. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100Â  (stating \r\n  it is only when an amendment to an indictment does not change the nature of \r\n  the offense charged that the amendment does not divest the trial court of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction); Sowell, 85 S.C. at 283-84, 67 S.E. at 317-19 (holding \r\n  when an amendment to an indictment substituted a different and distinct offense \r\n  from the one charged the trial court is divested of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because the grand jury had not indicted the defendant on the substituted offense). \r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, Brysonâ€™s convictions for resisting \r\n  arrest and pointing a firearm are\r\nVACATED. [7] \r\nStrom, A.J., concurring.\r\nStilwell, J., concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part. \r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  (concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part):Â  Although I agree that the conviction for pointing a firearm should \r\n  be vacated for the reasons stated in the majority opinion, I am compelled to \r\n  dissent as to the conviction for resisting arrest.\r\nThe indictment as originally drawn charged Bryson \r\n  with assault on a police officer while resisting arrest.Â  The jury acquitted \r\n  him of that charge, but convicted him of the lesser-included offense of resisting \r\n  arrest.Â  See State v. Ritter, 296 S.C. 51, 370 S.E.2d 610 (1988) \r\n  (16-9-320(B) includes all of the elements of section 16-9-320(B) â€” knowingly \r\n  and willfully resisting a lawful arrest â€” subsection (A) is then necessarily \r\n  a lesser-included offense of subsection (B)).\r\nThat is of no moment, however, because if the court \r\n  was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction on the indictment because of the \r\n  amendment prior to trial, it could not have convicted Bryson of the lesser-included \r\n  offense.Â  However, both subsections (A) and (B) are specific in that the prohibited \r\n  conduct is limited to and must involve a particular class of individual, i.e., \r\n  a law enforcement officer.Â  The original indictment identifies the victim as \r\n  a law enforcement officer of this state in addition to naming him.Â  In my view, \r\n  under the statute in question, it is not necessary to include the name of the \r\n  law enforcement officer as long as the victim is clearly identified as such.Â  \r\n  Naming him would be mere surplusage.Â  State v. White, 338 S.C. 56, 525 \r\n  S.E.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nThe majority opinion reasons that the amendment \r\n  changing the identity of the officer deprives the trial court of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction because if more than one officer is assaulted, each assault is \r\n  a separate offense and therefore the identity of the victim is necessary.Â  If \r\n  this indictment, as originally drafted, charged Bryson with assaulting several \r\n  officers, I might be inclined to agree.Â  However, I do not believe we have to \r\n  address that issue because that is not the case before us.Â  Bryson was charged \r\n  with assaulting â€œaâ€ police officer, and he was sufficiently apprised of what \r\n  he had to defend against.\r\nI do not believe that amending the indictment merely \r\n  to change the name of the victim deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because it did not change the nature of the offense charged.Â  I would therefore \r\n  affirm the conviction for resisting arrest.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  According to the record, Deputy Richardson was no longer employed \r\n    by the sheriffâ€™s department at the time of trial and was unavailable as a \r\n    witness. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Prior to trial, the state nolle prossed one count of possession \r\n    of a stolen vehicle and a second count of possession of a pistol by a person \r\n    under the age of twenty-one. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  See State v. Ritter, 296 S.C. 51, 53, 370 S.E.2d 610, \r\n    610-11 (1988) (holding resisting arrest is a lesser-included offense of assaulting \r\n    an officer while resisting arrest).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Because Bryson was indicted for assaulting an officer while resisting \r\n    arrest, we begin our inquiry by examining the amendment to the indictment \r\n    of that offense to determine whether the circuit court had subject matter \r\n    jurisdiction to try Bryson.Â  We will then consider the circuit courtâ€™s jurisdiction \r\n    over the lesser-included offense of resisting arrest for which Bryson was \r\n    convicted.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  We have found no reported South Carolina cases stating there was \r\n    only one charge of assaulting an officer while resisting arrest when the defendant \r\n    assaulted two officers during the course of an arrest. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  We note two cases that suggest an amendment to an indictment that \r\n    changes the identity of the victim does not divest the circuit court of subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction. State v. Johnson, 314 S.C. 161, 166, 442 S.E.2d \r\n    191, 194 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding an amendment that changed the name of the \r\n    owner of property listed in an indictment for breach of trust did not change \r\n    the nature of the offense); State v. Sweat, 221 S.C. 270, 273-74, 70 \r\n    S.E.2d 234, 235-36 (1952) (holding an amendment to a larceny indictment did \r\n    not change the nature of the offense when the name listed as the owner of \r\n    the stolen goods was changed to the name of the actual owner). These cases \r\n    are distinguishable because each involved only one count of a particular crime, \r\n    while the present case involves two counts of assaulting an officer while \r\n    resisting arrest, and the separate counts can be distinguished only by knowing \r\n    the identity of the victim involved. See State v. Guthrie, 352 \r\n    S. C. 103, 111-12, 572 S.E.2d 309, 313-14 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding an element \r\n    is an essential ingredient of the crime when an amendment to that element \r\n    would materially change the proof required to convict the defendant of the \r\n    crime); 41 Am. Jur.2d Indictments and Informations Â§ 168 (1995) (stating \r\n    an amendment is substantive and thus not permitted unless â€œthe same defense \r\n    is available to the defendant both before and after the amendment and upon \r\n    the same evidenceâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Because oral argument would not aid the Court in resolving any issue \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3714","title":"State v.

Savitz, III andÂ  Senior Assistant \r\n  Appellate Defender Wanda H. Haile, both of the South Carolina Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Sr., Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â Â  Following an almost daylong \r\n  drinking episode, Virginia Burgess killed her intoxicated husband sometime during \r\n  the evening of August 7, 1998.Â  She stabbed him forty-seven times.Â  At trial, \r\n  Burgess claimed not to remember anything about the evening after the two had \r\n  argued.Â  A jury convicted her of murder and possession of a weapon during a \r\n  violent crime.Â  The trial court sentenced her to thirty years imprisonment for \r\n  murder and five years for the weapons charge, the sentences to run concurrently.Â  \r\n  On appeal, Burgess argues the trial court abused its discretion by not ordering \r\n  a psychiatric examination pursuant to section 44-23-410 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code [1]  to determine her competency to stand trial.Â  \r\n  We disagree and affirm.Â  \r\nAt a pretrial motions hearing held on \r\n  the eve of trial in May 2000, nearly two years following the decedentâ€™s death, \r\n  defense counsel, who had undertaken the defense of Burgess three months before \r\n  in February 2000, moved to have the trial court order an evaluation of Burgessâ€™s \r\n  competency to stand trial.Â  Counsel asserted an inability to talk intelligently \r\n  with her, stated his conversations with her led him to believe she could not \r\n  assist in her own defense, and pointed to prior I.Q. tests that reflected that \r\n  Burgessâ€™s I.Q. registered between 56 and 66.Â  He offered no medical or mental \r\n  health records in support of the motion and referred only to records that related \r\n  to her alcoholism and mental retardation. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nThe trial judge examined Burgess under oath to \r\n  determine if she understood the pending charges, the purpose of the proceedings, \r\n  and the roles of the individuals involved.Â  Burgess said that she understood \r\n  what she was charged with, that the State claimed she had killed her husband \r\n  in August of that year; that her lawyerâ€™s role was â€œto representâ€ her and the \r\n  prosecutorâ€™s role was to â€œtalk against meâ€; and that a jury would determine \r\n  her guilt or innocence.Â  Burgess acknowledged that when she talked to her lawyer, \r\n  she thought she would be able to tell him her side of the story; and that the \r\n  State would offer witnesses to testify against her and her lawyer would have \r\n  an opportunity to question them.Â  \r\nNoting that Burgessâ€™s demeanor in the courtroom \r\n  â€œhas been very appropriateâ€ and pointing to the lack of any medical opinion \r\n  regarding her competence to stand trial, the trial judge denied the request \r\n  for a psychiatric examination.Â  He found Burgess â€œseemed . . . able to understand \r\n  everythingâ€ he had asked her, appeared to understand the proceedings and the \r\n  role of trial participants, was able to identify the person whom she was alleged \r\n  to have killed and to state when the killing was alleged to have occurred, and \r\n  understood the charges made against her.Â  \r\nDefense counsel renewed at trial the motion for \r\n  a psychiatric examination of Burgess; however, the trial judge denied the motion.Â  \r\n\r\nThe question of whether to order a competency examination \r\n  falls within the discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be overturned \r\n  on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion. [3] Â  Burgess made no clear showing \r\n  of an abuse of discretion here.\r\nBy statute, the question of whether a defendant \r\n  is fit to stand trial depends upon whether the defendant, because of a lack \r\n  of mental capacity, cannot â€œunderstand the proceedingsâ€ or â€œassist in his [or \r\n  her] own defense.â€ [4]  Factors to be considered in determining \r\n  whether further inquiry into a defendantâ€™s fitness to stand trial is warranted \r\n  include evidence of his or her irrational behavior, his or her demeanor at trial, \r\n  and any prior medical opinion on his or her competence to stand trial. [5] Â  In some circumstances, the presence \r\n  of just one of these factors may justify a trial courtâ€™s ordering a further \r\n  inquiry into a defendantâ€™s competency to undergo trial. [6] \r\nHere, Burgess had not previously been \r\n  adjudicated incompetent to stand trial; the record does not belie the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s observation that her demeanor during the pretrial motion appeared to \r\n  be â€œvery appropriateâ€;  [7]  and the record of the pretrial \r\n  motion hearing manifests she understood the proceedings, the roles of the various \r\n  participants, and the charges leveled against her.Â  Beyond defense counselâ€™s \r\n  statements regarding his inability to talk intelligently with Burgess and his \r\n  opinion that she could not assist in her own defense, counsel offered nothing \r\n  to demonstrate that Burgessâ€™s mental retardation was such as to render her unfit \r\n  to stand trial. [8] Â  Under these circumstances we are not inclined \r\n  to second guess the trial judge and hold he did not clearly abuse his discretion \r\n  in denying Burgessâ€™s motion for a mental examination regarding her fitness to \r\n  stand trial. [9] Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, J., concurs. \r\nCONNOR, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nCONNOR, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In \r\n  my opinion, the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to order a psychological \r\n  evaluation of Burgess where there was reason to believe Burgess could not assist \r\n  her attorney.Â  \r\nBurgess was represented by counsel from \r\n  the time of the incident.Â  Although counsel discussed with the solicitor the \r\n  possibility of Burgess having a competency evaluation, counsel never made a \r\n  motion to have the evaluation performed.Â  Burgess obtained new counsel in February \r\n  2000, three months before trial.Â  \r\nDuring the pre-trial conference the day \r\n  before trial, the solicitor recounted the procedural history of the case and \r\n  noted that Burgess had a long history of alcohol abuse and blackouts.Â  Burgessâ€™ \r\n  new counsel requested a psychological evaluation.Â  Counsel informed the judge \r\n  that he requested an evaluation as soon as he was appointed to the case, but \r\n  there was confusion over whether the State consented.Â  Counsel argued Burgess \r\n  had â€œmental health deficiencies,â€ could not intelligently converse with him, \r\n  had a recent IQ test showing an IQ of 61, and was unable to assist in her defense.Â  \r\n  Counsel could not discuss the case with Burgess because she did not understand \r\n  what he was talking about.Â  According to counsel, Burgessâ€™ only focus was when \r\n  she was getting out of jail.Â Â Â  \r\nCounsel quoted from the December 2, 1998, affidavit \r\n  by Dr. Keith.Â  Dr. Keith opined that Burgess exhibited borderline mental retardation, \r\n  behaved like a child, and posed no threat to others.Â  Dr. Keith stated that \r\n  Burgess needed medical procedures to evaluate her mental and physical problems, \r\n  including an EEG, an MRI, consultation with a neurologist, and a PGI workup.Â  \r\n  It is not clear that the neurological examination was ever performed.Â  \r\nThe only psychological evaluations ever performed \r\n  on Burgess were in connection with her prior hospitalizations for alcohol abuse \r\n  and in connection with her application for SSI. \r\n  [10] Â  The tests did not address the issue of competency.Â  One test indicated \r\n  Burgess had a very low survival skills quotient of 45.Â  Because no prior competency \r\n  evaluations had been performed on Burgess, counsel did not have any further \r\n  medical evidence to present to the trial judge.Â  \r\nAs the majority opinion notes, Burgess \r\n  appeared to respond appropriately to the questions posed by the trial judge \r\n  during questioning.Â  However, most of Burgessâ€™ answers were a simple â€œyes, sirâ€ \r\n  to the judgeâ€™s questions.Â  Although Burgess identified the charge of â€œmurder,â€ \r\n  the victim, the month of the crime, and her attorneyâ€™s role, she was unclear \r\n  as to the role of the solicitor.Â  Specifically, she appeared to be guessing \r\n  when answering that the solicitorâ€™s role was to â€œTalk against me?â€Â  Burgess \r\n  also informed the judge that she had not really spoken with counsel â€œlike we \r\n  should.â€Â  When asked by the judge if she could tell her side of the story to \r\n  her attorney, she responded, â€œI think.â€Â  Burgessâ€™ counsel informed the trial \r\n  judge that Burgessâ€™ communication skills that day were better than they ever \r\n  were when he attempted to discuss the case with her prior to that time and that \r\n  he could not determine whether â€œguilty but mentally illâ€ was applicable to Burgess \r\n  at that point.Â  Citing only Burgessâ€™ apparent understanding of the roles of \r\n  the parties and the charges against her, the trial judge denied counselâ€™s motion \r\n  for a competency evaluation.Â Â  \r\nCounsel requested reconsideration of his motion \r\n  at the start of trial, arguing that, as appointed counsel, he did not have the \r\n  funds to get a psychological evaluation of Burgess performed prior to trial.Â  \r\n  He informed the judge again about his difficulties in consulting with Burgess, \r\n  and he argued the evaluation was necessary to determine what defenses could \r\n  be pursued.Â  Counsel stated as follows:\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t believe I can talk to her a little bit.Â  Sheâ€™s very \r\n  hard to talk to and you almost need a third party like an Ann Kirven who is \r\n  at the alcohol and drug abuse department to do that because sheâ€™s â€“ over the \r\n  years of dealing with [Burgess], sheâ€™s earned [Burgessâ€™] trust and she opens \r\n  up a little bit more to her even though itâ€™s a little bit incoherent.\r\n\r\nCiting State v. Blair, 275 S.C. 529, 273 \r\n  S.E.2d 536 (1981), the judge denied the request, finding Burgess did not exhibit \r\n  irrational behavior, her demeanor was appropriate, and there was no medical \r\n  evidence to support further inquiry into competence.Â Â Â Â  \r\nTrial judges have a duty to order a psychiatric \r\n  examination for a defendant if there is reason to believe the defendant is not \r\n  fit to stand trial because of an inability to understand the proceedings or \r\n  an inability to assist in her own defense.Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. \r\n  352, 364, 535 S.E.2d 420, 426 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-410 (2002) (â€œWhenever \r\n  a judge of the Circuit Court . . . has reason to believe that a person on trial \r\n  before him . . . is not fit to stand trial because the person lacks the capacity \r\n  to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense as \r\n  a result of a lack of mental capacity, the judge shall . . . order examination \r\n  of the person by two examiners designated by the Department of Mental Health \r\n  . . . .â€) (emphasis added).Â  â€œâ€˜[E]vidence of a defendantâ€™s irrational behavior, \r\n  his demeanor at trial and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial \r\n  are all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but . . \r\n  . even one of these factors, standing alone, may, in some circumstances, be \r\n  sufficient.â€™â€Â  Blair, 275 S.C. at 533, 273 S.E.2d at 538 (quoting Drope \r\n  v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162 (1975)).Â  Whether to order a competency evaluation \r\n  is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion, and his decision will not be overturned \r\n  on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.Â  Locklair, \r\n  341 S.C. at 364, 535 S.E.2d at 426.Â  \r\nI am guided by the analysis in State v. Singleton, \r\n  322 S.C. 480, 472 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  This Court found the trial judge \r\n  abused his discretion in failing to order a mental evaluation.Â  At his probation \r\n  revocation hearing, Singletonâ€™s attorney informed the trial judge that Singleton \r\n  suffered from audio and visual hallucinations and was being treated by the Mental \r\n  Health Commission.Â  Singletonâ€™s mother told the judge that Singletonâ€™s odd and \r\n  violent behavior stemmed from a poisoning incident as a child.Â  Counsel informed \r\n  the judge that he was seeking a mental evaluation of Singleton and moved to \r\n  hold the probation proceeding in abeyance.Â  The trial judge denied the motion, \r\n  but he later urged treatment for Singletonâ€™s mental condition.Â  After reviewing \r\n  the entire record, the statements to the judge by Singletonâ€™s counsel and mother, \r\n  and the trial judgeâ€™s concern for Singletonâ€™s later treatment, this Court reversed \r\n  the judgeâ€™s failure to order an examination pursuant to section 44-23-410.Â  \r\n  Singleton, 322 S.C. at 483-84, 472 S.E.2d at 642.\r\nSimilarly, I believe Burgessâ€™ counsel presented \r\n  enough information to the trial judge to give him â€œreason to believeâ€ that further \r\n  evaluation of Burgessâ€™ condition was warranted.Â  The State did not dispute Burgessâ€™ \r\n  history of blackouts and her low IQ of 61.Â  Counsel repeatedly informed the \r\n  judge that he had immense difficulty conversing with Burgess and that she did \r\n  not understand the full ramifications of the trial.Â  The affidavit from Dr. \r\n  Keith indicated that Burgess was borderline mentally retarded, had the mentality \r\n  of a child, and was in need of further neurological evaluation.Â  Counsel also \r\n  indicated the defense of â€œguilty but mentally illâ€ could not be pursued absent \r\n  an evaluation.Â  Most of Burgessâ€™ answers during the trial judgeâ€™s examination \r\n  of her were one or two words.Â  Further, it does not appear from the record that \r\n  Burgess was confident she could assist her attorney when she informed the judge \r\n  that she thought she could tell him her story. \r\nAs the majority points out in a footnote, \r\n  Burgess testified during the Jackson v. Denno hearing and, later, in \r\n  her own defense.Â  During the Jackson v. Denno hearing, Burgess stated \r\n  she did not understand her Miranda warnings and she was confused.Â  Burgessâ€™ \r\n  testimony regarding her medicine was extremely confusing, and she stated she \r\n  had problems remembering things.Â  Prior to testifying in her own defense, the \r\n  trial judge questioned Burgess regarding her decision to testify.Â  Despite her \r\n  guess at the pre-trial hearing that the solicitorâ€™s role was to â€œTalk against \r\n  me?,â€ Burgess did not understand that the solicitor had the burden to prove \r\n  her guilty and that she did not have a burden to prove her innocence.Â Â Â  Although \r\n  Burgess was able to testify regarding the events on the day of the incident, \r\n  she repeatedly testified that she passed out on her couch that evening and was \r\n  not aware of what was happening until she awoke the next day to find her husband \r\n  deceased.Â  Ann Kirven, Burgessâ€™ case worker from the Alcohol and Drug Abuse \r\n  Commission, testified that Burgess exhibited difficulties with comprehension \r\n  throughout her placement at Morris Village.Â  There was also evidence in the \r\n  record that Burgess had to defend herself against the victim with a knife on \r\n  a prior occasion. Â Â \r\nAlthough the majority points to Burgessâ€™ testimony \r\n  as evidence that Burgess was competent to stand trial, I believe the testimony \r\n  in the record raises further questions regarding Burgessâ€™ ability to comprehend \r\n  the proceedings and assist in her defense.Â  Burgessâ€™ inability to comprehend \r\n  or discuss the case intelligently with her attorney prohibited her attorney \r\n  from raising possible defenses, including guilty but mentally ill or battered \r\n  spouse syndrome.Â  Burgessâ€™ low IQ, inability to understand the exact role of \r\n  the solicitor, history of blackouts, deficiencies with comprehension, difficulties \r\n  remembering, and inability to intelligently discuss her case with her attorney \r\n  certainly gave the trial judge a â€œreason to believeâ€ that Burgess needed further \r\n  evaluation of her competency.Â  Because there was evidence in the record that \r\n  Burgess could not comprehend or speak intelligently with her attorney, I would \r\n  find that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to order an examination \r\n  of Burgess as required by statute.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse and remand for a psychological \r\n  evaluation.Â  I would further order the circuit court to hold a hearing to determine \r\n  whether Burgess was competent to stand trial.Â  If the circuit court finds that \r\n  Burgess was incompetent to stand trial, the court should issue an order reversing \r\n  her conviction and granting her a new trial when she is presently competent \r\n  to stand trial.Â  If the hearing reveals Burgess was competent, her conviction \r\n  will stand.Â  See Blair, 275 S.C. at 534, 273 S.E.2d at 538 (â€œ[O]n \r\n  remand, if the hearing reveals Blair was incompetent to stand trial, an order \r\n  reversing his conviction should be entered and a new trial granted when he is \r\n  presently competent to stand trial.Â  However, if the hearing reveals Blair was \r\n  competent to stand trial, the conviction will stand.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  S.C.

Denno, \r\n    378 U.S. 368 (1964) hearing and before the jury, Burgess appeared able to \r\n    advise the court of the medication she had taken both in August 1998, when \r\n    the killing occurred, and in May 2000, when the trial took place.Â  Although \r\n    some initial confusion developed regarding whether she was taking Prozac at \r\n    the time of the offense, she explained that she was not taking it.Â  Burgess \r\n    admitted that she understood what her Miranda rights meant, but claimed she \r\n    did not understand them when first questioned by the police.Â  Further, she \r\n    admitted she had refused to talk to the police at some point during the questioning \r\n    because â€œI needed a lawyer and they read me my rights,â€ and that she had invoked \r\n    her right to counsel twice on the day the offense occurred.Â  Her testimony \r\n    before the jury provided a detailed account of her activities that led up \r\n    to the crime and her activities on the morning she reportedly discovered her \r\n    husband had been killed.Â  Burgess testified she did not recall what had occurred \r\n    when her husband returned home because she had either passed out or fallen \r\n    asleep.Â  Burgessâ€™s testimony, therefore, seems to undercut any question of \r\n    her lack of competency to stand trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9] Â  See Richardson v. State, 663 S.W.2d 111, 113 (Tex. \r\n    Ct. App. 1983) (holding the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing \r\n    the defendantâ€™s motion for a psychiatric examination even though counselâ€™s \r\n    testimony revealed possible problems with the defendantâ€™s communication, memory, \r\n    and veracity where there was no psychiatric testimony and the defendantâ€™s \r\n    testimony refuted counselâ€™s representations); see also State v. \r\n    Chapin, 424 N.E.2d 317, 319-20 (Ohio 1981) (finding â€œgood causeâ€ was not \r\n    shown to grant a motion made during trial for a competency hearing where the \r\n    defendant had previously been found competent to stand trial after a pretrial \r\n    hearing and no objective indication of the defendantâ€™s unfitness for trial \r\n    was demonstrated by the defendantâ€™s conduct, the defendantâ€™s medical records, \r\n    or defense counselâ€™s mere assertions that the defendantâ€™s fitness was now \r\n    questionable).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [10]  Both Burgess and her counsel testified that Burgess received Supplemental \r\n    Security Income from the Social Security Administration due to her mental \r\n    deficiencies.Â  The victimâ€™s aunt was the payee responsible for handling Burgessâ€™ \r\n    finances.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3715","title":"Green v.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3715\r\nSubmitted November 3, 2002 â€“ Filed December \r\n  15, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDonnell G. Jennings and R. Hawthorne Barrett, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nZack E. Townsend, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Mildred Green sued Jason Fritz \r\n  to recover damages for bodily injuries suffered during an automobile accident.Â Â  \r\n  The jury returned a verdict for Green in the amount of $1,500.00 in actual damages \r\n  and $500.00 in punitive damages.Â  Green moved for a new trial nisi additur.Â  \r\n  The trial judge granted the motion, increasing the total award to $14,000.00.Â  \r\n  Fritz appeals, asserting, inter alia, the motion was improvidently \r\n  granted because the trial judge failed to articulate compelling reasons to invade \r\n  the province of the jury.Â  We reverse and reinstate the jury verdict.\r\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFritz was attempting to turn left out of a gas \r\n  station parking lot.Â  To execute the turn and join left-bound traffic, Fritz \r\n  had to cross three lanes of right-bound traffic.Â  A vehicle in the closest right-bound \r\n  lane slowed and signaled for Fritz to proceed, which he did.Â  After successfully \r\n  crossing two lanes of traffic, however, Fritz collided with Green.\r\nThe EMS crew that responded to \r\n  the accident took Green by ambulance to the Orangeburg Regional Medical Center.Â  \r\n  Green, who had a history of high blood pressure and diabetes, was kept overnight \r\n  for the purpose of monitoring her blood sugar and blood pressure.Â  During her \r\n  stay at the hospital, Green did not complain of, and was not treated for, neck, \r\n  back, or muscle pain.Â  \r\nGreen took two days off from \r\n  work after the accident, though she testified that the pain in her neck and \r\n  back persisted after that period.Â  Four weeks after the accident, Green sought \r\n  treatment from Dr. Shay, a chiropractor.Â  Dr. Shay diagnosed Green with cervical \r\n  subluxation. [1] Â  The treatment \r\n  lasted approximately four weeks and cost a total of $1,470.00.Â  \r\nGreen brought this negligence action against Fritz, \r\n  seeking to recover damages sustained in the accident.Â  During opening remarks \r\n  at trial, Fritzâ€™s attorney admitted fault.Â  Greenâ€™s chiropractor testified about \r\n  the extent of Greenâ€™s back injuries.Â  On cross-examination, defense counsel \r\n  challenged the causal link between the accident and Greenâ€™s subluxation diagnosis.Â  \r\n  Specifically, Dr. Shay was asked whether Greenâ€™s back injury could have been \r\n  caused by something other than the car accident, and Dr. Shay admitted that \r\n  was possible.Â  Green did not claim to experience any accident-related problems \r\n  subsequent to her treatment with Dr. Shay.Â  She also did not claim to have sustained \r\n  any permanent injuries as a result of the accident.Â  \r\nFollowing the juryâ€™s verdict, Green moved for a \r\n  new trial nisi additur, arguing that the verdict was grossly inadequate \r\n  and that â€œit had to be compassion, prejudice or something of that nature, some \r\n  other outside influence.â€Â  The trial court granted Greenâ€™s motion for a new \r\n  trial nisi additur, increasing the juryâ€™s total award from $2,000.00 \r\n  to $14,000.00.Â  Â Â The order, in its entirety, reads as follows:\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffâ€™s motion for a new trial nisi additur or in \r\n  the alternative for a new trial absolute is hereby granted.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in the amount of $1500.00 actual \r\n  damages and $500.00 punitive damages.Â  The evidence revealed that the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  actual damages were:\r\n  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Loss [sic] Wages 118.88\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hospital Bill 1132.55\r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Dr. Shea [sic] 1470.00\r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Medical Records 21.47\r\n5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ambulance Bill 186.35\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Total Special Damages =2929.25\r\n  \r\nIt is well settled that a trial judge may add to or subtract \r\n  the juryâ€™s award if it appears to be the result of passion, caprice, or something \r\n  not found in the record.Â  If [sic] find and conclude that the verdict in this \r\n  case is grossly inadequate.\r\nIt is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the sum \r\n  of $12,000.00 be added to the juryâ€™s award of $2000.00 for a total award of \r\n  $14000.00.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court improperly grant Greenâ€™s motion \r\n  for a new trial nisi additur?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial judge may grant a new trial nisi \r\n  additur whenever he or she finds the amount of the verdict to be merely \r\n  inadequate.Â  Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 438 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  While the granting of such a motion rests within the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial court, substantial deference must be afforded to the \r\n  jury's determination of damages.Â  Evans v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., \r\n  337 S.C. 95, 100, 522 S.E.2d 350, 352 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  To this end, a judge \r\n  must offer compelling reasons for invading the jury's province by granting a \r\n  motion for additur.Â  Bailey v. Peacock, 318 S.C. 13, 14, 455 S.E.2d \r\n  690, 691 (1995).Â  We will only reverse if the trial judge abused his discretion \r\n  in deciding a motion for new trial nisi additur to the extent \r\n  that an error of law results.Â  Patterson, 318 S.C. at 185, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  at 438.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFritz argues the trial judge erred when he granted \r\n  the motion without articulating compelling reasons.Â  We agree.\r\nA trial judge may grant a new trial nisi \r\n  additur when a juryâ€™s verdict is inadequate.Â  Bailey, 318 S.C. \r\n  at 14, 455 S.E.2d at 691.Â  However, to grant such relief, the trial judge must \r\n  state compelling reasons for invading the province of the jury.Â  Krepps v. \r\n  Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 607, 479 S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Similarly, \r\n  if inapplicable grounds are given for granting additur, the order fails \r\n  by error of law.Â  Bailey, 318 S.C. at 14-5, 455 S.E.2d at 692 (explaining \r\n  impropriety of granting additur or remittitur on the basis of \r\n  the â€œthirteenth jurorâ€ doctrine).Â  Here, the trial court provided no compelling \r\n  reasons for invading the province of the jury in granting additur.Â  \r\nWhere, as here, the evidence of damages is disputed, \r\n  the mere listing of Greenâ€™s claimed damages by the trial judge in his order \r\n  does not constitute compelling reasons for invading the juryâ€™s province.Â  The \r\n  order offers no reasons upon which we can review the appropriateness of usurping \r\n  the juryâ€™s decision on damages.Â  \r\nIn support of the grant of a new trial nisi \r\n  additur and his conclusory statement that the verdict was grossly inadequate, \r\n  Green argues that the jury ignored evidence of bills and â€œundisputed pain and \r\n  suffering,â€ thereby demonstrating â€œpassion, caprice, prejudice particularly, \r\n  corruption or some other improper motive.â€Â  If indeed the juryâ€™s verdict was \r\n  motivated by caprice, passion, or prejudice, the appropriate remedy would be \r\n  for a new trial absolute. Waring v. Johnson, 341 S.C. 248, 257, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  906, 911 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œIf the amount of the verdict is so grossly inadequate \r\n  or excessive that it shocks the conscience of the court and clearly indicates \r\n  the amount was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruption \r\n  or some other improper motives, the trial judge is required to grant a new trial \r\n  absolute.â€).Â  Greenâ€™s only post-trial motion was for a new trial nisi \r\n  additur.\r\nÂ We find the trial judge abused his discretion in granting \r\n  a new trial nisi additur without stating compelling reasons.Â  \r\n  The trial judgeâ€™s order is therefore reversed and the jury verdict is reinstated. \r\n  [2]Â Â \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Subluxation is a condition where vertebrae are \r\n    out of alignment.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Because we find the trial judgeâ€™s order granting a new trial nisi \r\n    additur was erroneous, we need not address Fritzâ€™s second argument \r\n    regarding the excessiveness of the additur amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3716","title":"Smith v.

David Sawyer, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3716\r\nHeard November 5, 2003 â€“ Filed December 15, 2003 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nH. Wayne Floyd, of West Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn D. Elliott, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:  Jane Smith brought this action \r\n  against John Doe to establish paternity and award child support for her mentally \r\n  disabled adult child, Danielle. [1] \r\n  Â  A paternity test established that Doe was Danielleâ€™s father, and the family \r\n  court ordered him to pay $91.00 a week in child support. Doe appeals, arguing: \r\n  (1) the statute of limitations barred the paternity action, and (2) in the event \r\n  the action is not time barred, the amount of child support awarded was excessive.Â  \r\n  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSmith and Doe met in 1964 while \r\n  Doe was working at a nightclub. Although Doe was married at the time, the two \r\n  had an affair, and Danielle was born in July of 1965. Doe was aware of Danielle, \r\n  but he never attempted to have a relationship with her nor did he offer any \r\n  type of financial support. Smith had previously never sought support because \r\n  she did not want to embarrass Doe; however, now that she has retired, she has \r\n  become worried about Danielleâ€™s future.Â  Because of this concern, Smith approached \r\n  Doe and asked that he recognize Danielle as his daughter so that Danielle could \r\n  receive Doeâ€™s social security benefits when he dies.Â  According to Smith, Doe \r\n  â€œlaughed and said, â€˜I donâ€™t think so.â€™â€ \r\nAs a result of that conversation, \r\n  Smith filed an action against Doe seeking a declaration of paternity and child \r\n  support. Doe denied paternity and moved to dismiss the action as being untimely \r\n  and barred by the applicable statute of limitations. A temporary hearing was \r\n  held before the family court. The family court denied Doeâ€™s motion to dismiss \r\n  and ordered the parties to undergo paternity testing. The paternity test established \r\n  Doe as Danielleâ€™s father, and a final hearing on the merits was held. \r\nAt the hearing, Smith testified \r\n  that Danielle has the mental capacity of a six-year-old and is unable to read, \r\n  perform math, drive, or cook. She further testified that Danielle cannot be \r\n  alone for more than a few hours at a time, and as a result Smith spends approximately \r\n  $35.00 a week for childcare. \r\nDoe again argued the action was \r\n  barred by the statute of limitations, the doctrine of laches, and the theory \r\n  of equitable estoppel. [2] Â  The family court found that \r\n  Doeâ€™s paternity of Danielle had been established and ordered him to begin paying \r\n  child support. The family court ordered Doe to pay $91.00 per week in child \r\n  support, $1,500.00 in attorney fees, and an arrearage of $6,188.00 accrued during \r\n  the pendency of litigation. \r\nDoe filed a motion to reconsider, \r\n  challenging, among other things, the amount of child support awarded on the \r\n  grounds that the family court failed to consider Danielleâ€™s social security \r\n  benefits and her income from employment.Â  It is undisputed that Danielle receives \r\n  approximately $275.00 per month in social security disability income and between \r\n  $250 to $500 a month working at a part-time job created for her through the \r\n  Babcock Center.Â  The family court denied Doeâ€™s motion and specifically noted \r\n  that the court considered Danielleâ€™s income in determining the amount of child \r\n  support. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn appeal from an order of the family court, this \r\n  court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€ Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 304, \r\n  540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (S.C. 2000).Â  Despite our broad scope of review, this court \r\n  is not required to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings nor ignore the fact \r\n  that the family court judge, â€œwho saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their testimony.â€ Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, \r\n  91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Â Â Â Â Â  Applicability of a Statute of Limitations\r\nDoe argues the family court erred in \r\n  failing to find the paternity suit was barred by the statute of limitations. \r\n  Doe asserts that once Danielle reached the age of majority (eighteen), the general \r\n  statute of limitations began running for the commencement of the paternity action.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. 15-3-530 (Supp. 2002).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe question of whether the statute \r\n  of limitations would bar a paternity action by or on behalf of an adult child \r\n  seeking child support has not been addressed by our courts. Although other jurisdictions \r\n  have addressed the applicability of the statute of limitations to paternity \r\n  actions, their review is specific to their own state statutes, most of which \r\n  specifically set forth a limitations period for bringing the action.Â  See \r\n  e.g., 23 PA. Cons. Stat. Ann. Â§ 4343(b) (2003) (requiring that a paternity \r\n  action be instituted within eighteen years of the childâ€™s birth); Padilla \r\n  v. Montano, 862 P.2d 1257 (N.M. Ct. App. 1993) (discussing the statute of \r\n  limitations for establishing paternity in states that have adopted the Uniform \r\n  Parentage Act); Oregon ex rel. Adult and Family Servs. Div. v. Keusink, \r\n  684 P.2d 1239 (Or.App. 1984) (finding that Oregon imposes no statutory time \r\n  bar to a paternity action except in the context of probate proceedings); See \r\n  generally 14 C.J.S. Child Â§ 81 (2003) (â€œA paternity proceeding brought \r\n  by or on behalf of the child may be governed by a statute of limitations of \r\n  at least the duration of the childâ€™s minority, or by a general statute of limitations \r\n  which is tolled during the infancy of the child, â€¦ or has no time bar.â€). \r\nTurning to our own statutory scheme, we find no \r\n  statute of limitations peculiar to paternity actions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-952 \r\n  (1985).Â  Section 20-7-952 provides that a paternity action may be brought by \r\n  a child or the natural mother of a child and expressly states that the word \r\n  â€œchildâ€ is not limited to a person under the age of eighteen. \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nRelying on South Carolina Department \r\n  of Social Services v. Lowman, 269 S.C. 41, 236 S.E.2d 194 (1977), Doe\r\nasserts that the general three-year statute of limitations should govern paternity actions. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2002). In Lowman the Department \r\n  of Social Services brought an action against Lowman seeking support for a seven-year-old \r\n  child born out of wedlock. The court found that the general statute of limitations \r\n  was applicable to an action involving child support, but noted that the duty \r\n  of a parent to support his or her child is a â€œcontinuing obligation.â€ Id. \r\n  at 48, 236 S.E.2d at 196. The supreme court remanded the case to the family \r\n  court for a determination as to whether Lowman was the childâ€™s father, and held \r\n  that, if paternity was established, Lowman could be required to make future \r\n  child support payments.Â  However, because of the six-year statute of limitations, \r\n  [4]  Lowman could not be required to reimburse D.S.S. for support accrued \r\n  more than six years prior to the commencement of the action.Â Â  \r\nBecause Lowman addresses only the applicability \r\n  of the general statute of limitations to an action for retroactive child support, \r\n  we do not find its holding applicable to this action, especially in light of \r\n  clear statutory language allowing paternity actions by and on behalf of children \r\n  older than eighteen years of age. See Â§ 20-7-952. Instead, we turn to \r\n  the recent decision of Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 578 S.E.2d 3 (2003), \r\n  for guidance. \r\nIn Riggs, mother commenced an action in \r\n  1998 seeking child support for the partiesâ€™ twenty-three-year-old daughter.Â  \r\n  The child, who still lived in the home, suffered from a genetic disease that \r\n  had not been diagnosed until she was twenty years old.Â  Father argued the family \r\n  court could not order child support because section 20-7-420(17) of the South \r\n  Carolina Code provided only for the â€œcontinuationâ€ of child support for a disabled \r\n  child over the age of eighteen.Â  Because the childâ€™s disability had not been \r\n  diagnosed until his child support obligation had already been terminated, father \r\n  argued that any order requiring him to pay child support would not be a â€œcontinuationâ€ \r\n  of support within the terms of the statute.Â  The supreme court disagreed, holding \r\n  that â€œthe family court is vested with jurisdiction to order child support for \r\n  an unemancipated disabled adult child.â€Â  Id. at 235, 578 S.E.2d at 5.Â  \r\n  The court further noted that it believed the legislature intended for â€œa non-custodial \r\n  parent [to] share the burden of supporting a child who cannot be emancipated \r\n  because of a disability that arose before majority but was diagnosed only after \r\n  the child turned eighteen.â€ Id.  \r\nIn this case, Danielle was born with a mental disability \r\n  that prevents her from becoming emancipated.Â  If she were a legitimate child, \r\n  her father would have a continuing obligation to support her as long as she \r\n  remained disabled.Â  Thus, if we were to impose the general statute of limitations \r\n  to Danielleâ€™s paternity action, we would in effect create a procedural barrier \r\n  to the rights of illegitimate children to receive child support when an action \r\n  on their behalf had not been brought within a certain amount of time.Â  In light \r\n  of our statutory and case law which require non-custodial parents to support \r\n  their disabled child beyond the childâ€™s eighteenth birthday, it makes no logical \r\n  sense to impose a time bar on an illegitimate childâ€™s prerequisite action to \r\n  establish paternity.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-90 (1976) (requiring \r\n  parents to provide support for their legitimate and illegitimate children); \r\n  Â§ 20-7-952 (allowing paternity actions to be brought by or on behalf of a child \r\n  and expressly stating that the term â€œchildâ€ is not limited to someone under \r\n  the age of eighteen); Riggs, 353 S.C. at 235, 578 S.E.2d at 5 (â€œ[T]he \r\n  family court is vested with jurisdiction to order child support for an unemancipated \r\n  disabled adult child.â€).Â  Thus, in the absence of a clear, statutory directive \r\n  setting forth the legislatureâ€™s intent to impose a statute of limitations to \r\n  unemancipated adult childrenâ€™s paternity actions, we decline to apply a statute \r\n  of limitations to the present action.\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Amount of Child Support Awarded\r\nDoe next argues the family court abused its discretion \r\n  by using the Child Support Guidelines to determine the amount of his child support \r\n  obligation. Specifically, Doe contends the family court failed to take into \r\n  account the â€œsignificant incomeâ€ Danielle received through her part-time job \r\n  and social security disability benefits.Â  We find no abuse of discretion. \r\nChild support awards are addressed to the sound \r\n  discretion of the family court and, absent an abuse of discretion, will not \r\n  be disturbed on appeal.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d \r\n  706, 710 (1984). â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled \r\n  by some error of law or where the order, based upon the findings of fact, is \r\n  without evidentiary support.â€Â  Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 448 -449, \r\n  539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nIn its order denying rehearing, the family court noted \r\n  that it took into consideration Danielleâ€™s social security benefits and her \r\n  modest income.Â  The family court explained that it used the guidelines in order \r\n  to take into account the partiesâ€™ respective incomes, and it noted, as an additional \r\n  sustaining ground, that it did not impute further income to Doe despite his \r\n  extensive deductions for business travel.Â  Because the record indicates the \r\n  family court considered Danielleâ€™s income and social security benefits, we find \r\n  no abuse of discretion in the amount of child support awarded.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court did not \r\n  err in allowing Smith to institute a paternity action on behalf of her thirty-five-year-old \r\n  child, who is unemancipated due to a disability that arose during her minority.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the child support award of $91.00 a week was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  The order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHOWARD and KITTREDGE, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    The names of the parties and the child have been \r\n    changed to protect their identities.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]    Doe does not appeal the family courtâ€™s findings regarding the doctrine \r\n    of laches and equitable estoppel.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    The only other reference to paternity actions appears in the probate \r\n    code.Â  Section 62-2-109(2)(ii) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2002) provides \r\n    that for purposes of intestate succession, a person born out of wedlock is \r\n    a manâ€™s child if: \r\n  [P]aternity is established \r\n    by an adjudication commenced before the death of the father or within the \r\n    later of eight months after the death of the father or six months after the \r\n    initial appointment of a personal representative of his estate and, if after \r\n    his death, by clear and convincing proof.\r\n  The probate code does not \r\n    provide a statute of limitations for determining paternity.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [4]  At\r\n  the time of the Lowman case, the general statue of limitations was six\r\n  years; the statute has since decreased to three years.

Moseley, \r\n  Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â  Roy McDowell was \r\n  injured in a motor vehicle collision while driving a tractor-trailer owned by \r\n  his employer, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (â€œGoodyearâ€) and insured by \r\n  Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Company and Travelers Indemnity Company of \r\n  Illinois (collectively â€œTravelersâ€).Â  McDowell brought this declaratory judgment \r\n  action against Travelers seeking to reform the insurance contract, alleging \r\n  Travelers failed to make a meaningful offer of underinsured motorist (â€œUIMâ€) \r\n  coverage to Goodyear.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to Travelers, \r\n  concluding, under any view of the evidence, a meaningful offer of UIM coverage \r\n  was made to and knowingly rejected by Goodyear.Â  McDowell appeals, arguing the \r\n  circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Travelers.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nMcDowellâ€™s suit arises from a traffic accident \r\n  in which he received injuries rendering him totally and permanently disabled.Â  \r\n  At the time of the accident, McDowell was operating a tractor-trailer owned \r\n  by Goodyear.Â  \r\nThe insurance company for the at-fault \r\n  driver paid McDowell $49,000.Â  Because McDowell alleged damages exceeding this \r\n  amount, McDowell sought to recover UIM coverage under Goodyearâ€™s policy with \r\n  Travelers.Â  Travelers denied the claim, alleging Goodyear had rejected UIM coverage.Â  \r\n  McDowell then brought this declaratory judgment action, alleging Travelers failed \r\n  to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to its insured, and thus, the policy \r\n  should be reformed to provide UIM coverage in the amount of the liability limits \r\n  of the policy.Â  \r\nTravelers moved for summary judgment, arguing it \r\n  made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage pursuant to both South Carolina Code \r\n  Annotated section 38-77-350 (A) (Supp. 2002) and State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn granting summary judgment to Travelers, the \r\n  circuit court held Travelers made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage which Goodyear \r\n  rejected.Â  McDowell appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; South Carolina Prop. and Cas. Guar. \r\n  Assoc. v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  To determine whether any material fact exists, â€œthe evidence and all inferences \r\n  which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Yensen, 345 S.C. at 518, 548 S.E.2d at 883.Â  \r\n  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of \r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œAn \r\n  appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard \r\n  applied by the trial court.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcDowell argues the circuit court erred \r\n  by holding Travelers made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage as required by \r\n  South Carolina Code Annotated section 38-77-160 (Supp. 2002).Â  McDowell contends \r\n  Travelersâ€™ failure to list the range of premiums for the available limits on \r\n  its form offering UIM coverage to Goodyear, as is required in section 38-77-350(A), \r\n  required reformation of the policy to include UIM coverage in the amount of \r\n  the liability limits.Â  Although we agree Travelers did not meet the requirements \r\n  of section 38-77-350(A), we disagree with McDowellâ€™s assertion that this alone \r\n  denotes failure to make a meaningful offer warranting reformation of the policy.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to McDowell, we \r\n  find the circuit court correctly held Travelers made a meaningful offer of UIM \r\n  coverage to Goodyear, which Goodyear rejected.\r\nSouth Carolina law requires automobile insurance \r\n  carriers to offer â€œat the option of the insured, underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage in the \r\n  event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits carried by \r\n  an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. \r\n  2002).Â  â€œIf the insurer fails to comply with its statutory duty to make a meaningful \r\n  offer to the insured, the policy will be reformed, by operation of law, to include \r\n  UIM coverage up to the limits of liability insurance carried by the insured.â€Â  \r\n  Butler v. Unisun, 323 S.C. 402, 405, 475 S.E.2d 758, 760 (1996).Â  When \r\n  an insurer fails to make a meaningful offer, the insured is entitled to reform \r\n  the policy to reflect coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits on \r\n  the insuredâ€™s policy.Â  Todd v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 305 S.C. 395, \r\n  399, 409 S.E.2d 361, 364 (1991).Â  \r\nAll insurers must complete a form approved \r\n  by the insurance commissioner when making the required offer of optional coverage \r\n  to applicants for automobile insurance policies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2002).Â  The form must include:\r\n\r\n(1)Â Â  a brief and concise explanation of the coverage,\r\n(2)Â  a list of available limits and the range of \r\n  premiums for the limits,\r\n(3)Â  a space for the insured to mark whether the insured \r\n  chooses to accept or reject the coverage and a space for the insured to select \r\n  the limits of coverage he desires,\r\n(4) a space for the insured to sign the form which \r\n  acknowledges that he has been offered the optional coverages,\r\n(5) the mailing address and telephone number of the \r\n  Insurance Department which the applicant may contact if the applicant has any \r\n  questions that the insurance agent is unable to answer.\r\n\r\nId. Â (emphasis added).Â  The statute \r\n  further provides:\r\n\r\nIf this form is properly completed and executed by the named \r\n  insured it is conclusively presumed that there was an informed, knowing selection \r\n  of coverage and neither the insurance company nor any insurance agent has any \r\n  liability to the named insured or any other insured under the policy for the \r\n  insuredâ€™s failure to purchase any optional coverage or higher limits.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (Supp. 2002).Â  Therefore, \r\n  an insurer who uses a properly executed offer form that complies with section \r\n  38-77-350(A) enjoys a conclusive presumption a meaningful offer was made.Â  Id.; \r\n  Antley v. Nobel Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 621, 632, 567 S.E.2d 872, 878 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  However, the insurer may not benefit from the protections of section \r\n  38-77-350(B) if the form does not comply with the statute.Â  Osborne v. Allstate \r\n  Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 486, 462 S.E.2d 291, 295 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nTo avoid the necessity of having to comply \r\n  with the array of self-insurance requirements from state to state, Goodyear \r\n  entered into a contract with Travelers whereby Travelers issued certificates \r\n  of insurance allowing Goodyear to comply with the insurance regulations of the \r\n  various states in which it operated while remaining ultimately liable for one-hundred \r\n  percent of the claims paid.Â  Under this contract, Goodyear pays Travelers an \r\n  administrative fee and reimburses Travelers one-hundred percent of the amount \r\n  paid in adjusting its claims during the policy period.Â  In essence, the contract \r\n  serves as a pass-through accounting mechanism to assist Goodyear in its claims \r\n  management process. [1] Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen Travelers and Goodyear signed this contract, \r\n  Travelers provided a form offering UIM coverage to Goodyear.Â  The form included \r\n  an explanation of UIM insurance, ranges of limits, and instructions for seeking \r\n  limits not shown.Â  The form had blanks for listing premium amounts for the various \r\n  limits.Â  Travelers did not fill in these blanks as required by subsection (A)(2).Â  \r\n  Thus, the form did not comply with the statute and Travelers does not enjoy \r\n  the statutory presumption that it made a meaningful offer of UIM. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B); Antley, 350 S.C. at 632, 567 S.E.2d at \r\n  878.Â  However, failing to comply with the statute does not necessarily require \r\n  reformation of the policy.Â  Rather, the insurer bears the burden of establishing \r\n  it made a meaningful offer of UIM pursuant to section 38-77-160 and Wannamaker.Â  \r\n  See Butler, 323 S.C. at 405, 475 S.E.2d at 760 (holding the insurer \r\n  has the initial burden of proving that a meaningful offer of optional coverage \r\n  had been made to the insured.); Antley, 350 S.C. at 632, 567 S.E.2d at \r\n  878 (â€œThe burden of proving a meaningful offer of optional coverage was made \r\n  rests with the insurer.â€). \r\n Our Supreme Court has adopted a four-part \r\n  test to determine whether an insurerâ€™s offer of optional UIM coverage is sufficiently \r\n  meaningful to satisfy the requirements of section 38-77-160.Â  To constitute \r\n  a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, â€œ(1) the insurerâ€™s notification process \r\n  must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing;Â  (2) the insurer \r\n  must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional \r\n  coverage in general terms;Â  (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured \r\n  of the nature of the optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be told that \r\n  optional coverages are available for an additional premium.â€ Â Wannamaker, \r\n  291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d at 556.Â  \r\nMcDowellâ€™s only contention under the \r\n  Wannamaker analysis is that Travelers failed to provide the premium amounts \r\n  for the optional UIM coverage.Â  Although the offer form contained no premium \r\n  amounts in the blanks provided, the contractual agreement between Goodyear and \r\n  Travelers includes a detailed formula for calculating the premium for UIM coverage.Â  \r\n  Both Goodyear and Travelers contend under this mathematical formula the premiums \r\n  were readily ascertainable because the amount paid by Goodyear would have been \r\n  equal to the amount of the claims Travelers paid for underinsured motorist benefits \r\n  on Goodyearâ€™s behalf, together with an administrative fee.Â  \r\nEldrich Carr, Goodyearâ€™s Global Risk \r\n  Manager responsible for ensuring Goodyearâ€™s company vehicles comply with state \r\n  insurance requirements, averred he is experienced in matters dealing with liability, \r\n  UIM coverage, and other types of vehicle insurance, and is fully aware of the \r\n  nature and purpose of UIM coverage.Â  In his affidavit, Carr acknowledged that \r\n  any premium for UIM coverage quoted on the UIM offer form would necessarily \r\n  be zero because the premium is equivalent to one-hundred percent of the claims \r\n  paid during the period of the contract.Â  Therefore, Carr stated Goodyear was \r\n  fully aware of the costs of the coverage and the available amounts, and thus, \r\n  â€œGoodyear made a knowing and informed decision in rejecting underinsured motorist \r\n  coverage.â€Â  Carr further explained Goodyear elected not to obtain UIM coverage \r\n  in South Carolina because Goodyear provides workersâ€™ compensation and other \r\n  benefits for employees injured on the job.Â  Essentially, Goodyear viewed UIM \r\n  coverage as an additional employee benefit it did not want to provide.Â  \r\nThe arrangement between Goodyear \r\n  and Travelers clearly demonstrates Goodyear understood the limits of optional \r\n  coverage and the costs associated therewith, as required by Wannamaker.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the circuit court did not err by granting summary judgment.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough Travelersâ€™ offer failed \r\n  to meet the requirements of section 38-77-350(A) and Travelers is not entitled \r\n  to the statutory presumption that a meaningful offer was made, Carrâ€™s uncontroverted \r\n  affidavit on behalf of Goodyear affirming a meaningful offer was made and acknowledging \r\n  Goodyear made a knowing and informed decision to reject UIM coverage conclusively \r\n  satisfies Travelersâ€™ burden of proof. \r\nÂ Therefore, the decision of the circuit court isÂ  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  This arrangement allowed Goodyear to meet these various state insurance \r\n    requirements without qualifying as self-insured in each state by reporting \r\n    Travelers as its insurer.Â  However, in rendering summary judgment, the circuit \r\n    court concluded the contractual arrangement between Travelers and Goodyear \r\n    did not constitute an insurance policy because there was no transfer of risk \r\n    to Travelers.Â  On appeal, McDowell contends the circuit court erred by reaching \r\n    this conclusion.Â  Because we hold a meaningful offer was made in any event, \r\n    we need not address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Schmidt initiated \r\n  a negligence action against Michael Courtney for injuries Schmidt sustained \r\n  when he was struck in the head by a golf ball while roofing a house located \r\n  adjacent to a golf course.Â  Kemper Sports of Crowfield, Inc. (Kemper Sports) \r\n  was later joined on claims of negligent design, operation, and maintenance of \r\n  the golf course.Â  The circuit court judge granted Kemper Sportsâ€™ motion for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  Schmidt appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn August 27, 1998, [1]  Schmidt \r\n  was roofing a house located at 113 Waveney Circle in the Hamlets section of \r\n  the Crowfield Development in Goose Creek, South Carolina.Â  The home is adjacent \r\n  to the Crowfield Golf and Country Club, which is owned and operated by Kemper \r\n  Sports.Â  Several oak trees stand between the house and golf course.\r\nWhile Schmidt was roofing, Courtney was playing golf at the \r\n  Crowfield Golf and Country Club.Â  When Courtney made his tee shot on the Number \r\n  11 fairway, he hooked his ball, causing it to fly out of the boundaries of the \r\n  course and over to the house where Schmidt was working.Â  The golf ball struck \r\n  Schmidt in the back of his head and knocked him unconscious.Â  A fellow worker \r\n  caught Schmidt and prevented him from falling off the roof.Â  Schmidt suffered \r\n  permanent brain damage from the injury and has been unable to work since the \r\n  accident.\r\nSchmidt initially filed a negligence suit against Courtney.Â  \r\n  Schmidt later joined Kemper Sports in the action, alleging negligent design, \r\n  construction, operation, and maintenance of the golf course.Â  After filing its \r\n  answer, Kemper Sports then moved for summary judgment. \r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, Schmidtâ€™s counsel, Joseph F. Kent, presented \r\n  information regarding an expert witness he located on May 7, 2002, just a few \r\n  weeks after Kent received notice of the motion for summary judgment.Â  The expert \r\n  witness, Gerald W. Pirkl, specializes in golf course safety, design, and maintenance.Â  \r\n  Kent professed: â€œWe were very long in finding this gentleman, Your Honor.Â  \r\n  I believe that before the case is over that it is going to turn out that Mr. \r\n  Pirkl is the most experienced person by way of expert witnesses in this area.â€Â  \r\n  Kent requested the court consider his affidavit which identified Pirkl and \r\n  set forth what Pirkl would likely state during testimony.Â  In his affidavit, \r\n  Kent declared:\r\n\r\nI, Joseph F. Kent, counsel for the Plaintiffs in this action, having been duly \r\n  sworn do depose and state as a proffer of evidence in this case, as follows:\r\n1.Â  Full and complete diagnosis of the closed head brain \r\n  injuries sustained by Wayne Schmidt while working at the residence known as \r\n  113 Waveney was not accomplished until about the first of December 1999.\r\n2.Â  Counsel knows of no cases in this jurisdiction concerning \r\n  the liability for negligent golf course design, maintenance or operation.\r\n3.Â  Counsel has found relatively few cases arising in the \r\n  country from claims of negligent golf course design, maintenance or operation \r\n  resulting in personal injuries to innocent parties outside of the bounds and \r\n  property of golf courses.\r\n4.Â  Counsel has testimony of experienced golfers and an \r\n  expert in the design of golf courses that foreseeable fields of play for tee \r\n  shots often extend beyond the bounds of certain fairway boundaries and that \r\n  such an extended field of play was foreseeable for the fairway and tee boxes \r\n  in this case.\r\n5.Â  Counsel has retained an expert in golf course design, \r\n  Gerald W. Pirkl, of Dana Point, California who counsel believes will testify \r\n  that the design of the fairway and tee boxes in this case bring the house at \r\n  113 Waveney Circle into a foreseeable area of play as counsel understands that \r\n  area to be defined by the United States Golf Association.\r\n6.Â  Counsel believes that the constructed contour and topography \r\n  of the fairway in this case eliminates or substantially reduces the opportunity \r\n  to play a first shot on the subject hole on the design centerline of the fairway.\r\n7.Â  Counsel believes that the said expert will further testify \r\n  that tee shots from the most distant tee box position at the fairway in question \r\n  reduces the available shot angle for fairway center line both as that line was \r\n  designed and perceived by golfers in the tee boxes.\r\n8.Â  Counsel believes that the evidence in this case will \r\n  be that together with the house location of the house in the predictable field \r\n  of play for this fairway, that the golf course operator failed to provide adequate \r\n  screening or fairway map information to reasonably guard and protect against \r\n  innocent parties outside of the golf course coming within the predictable flight \r\n  of tee shots from the fairway in this case.\r\n9.Â  Counsel has already begun to shoot aerial photographs \r\n  of the subject fairway and tee boxes necessary for a written opinion with specifications \r\n  concerning the deficiencies of the design, maintenance and operation of the \r\n  Defendant Kemper in this case.\r\n10.Â  Counsel anticipates a first written report from his \r\n  expert landscape architect within about two weeks and supplemental discovery \r\n  responses of aerial photography on May 13, 2002.\r\n\r\nKent explained that he expected a final report from Pirkl â€œbefore the end of \r\n  th[e] month.â€Â  The judge determined the issue of the expert witness was not \r\n  before the court because Kent did not timely file the affidavit.\r\nThe circuit judge granted Kemper Sportsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  Schmidt \r\n  filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Laurens \r\n  Emergency Med.

Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. \r\n  Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003); Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., \r\n  353 S.C. 449, 578 S.E.2d 711 (2003); McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, \r\n  499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998); see also Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, \r\n  355 S.C. at 108, 584 S.E.2d at 377 (stating that in reviewing summary judgment \r\n  motion, facts and circumstances must be viewed in light most favorable to non-moving \r\n  party).Â  If triable issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.Â  Baril \r\n  v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002); \r\n  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  413 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to \r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Russell v. Wachovia Bank, \r\n  N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 578 S.E.2d 329 (2003); Regions Bank, 354 S.C. \r\n  at 659, 582 S.E.2d at 438; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against \r\n  the moving party.Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. \r\n  115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001); see also Ferguson v. Charleston \r\n  Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002) (â€œOn \r\n  appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review \r\n  all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence \r\n  in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.â€).\r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party seeking summary judgment has the initial \r\n  burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Regions \r\n  Bank, 354 S.C. at 659, 582 S.E.2d at 438; Trivelas v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Once the \r\n  party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence \r\n  of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest \r\n  on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank, \r\n  354 S.C. at 660, 582 S.E.2d at 438.Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward \r\n  with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  SSI Med. \r\n  Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990); Peterson v. \r\n  West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of \r\n  cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, \r\n  354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 868 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSchmidt argues the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to Kemper Sports on this novel claim prior to the opportunity \r\n  for full and fair discovery.Â  We agree.\r\nI.Â  CONTINUANCE\r\nKemper Sports alleges in its brief that Schmidtâ€™s counsel failed \r\n  to request a continuance to develop documentation in opposition to summary judgment.Â  \r\n  Although Kent did not specifically ask for a continuance, it is clear from the \r\n  transcript of the hearing the trial judge was fully aware of the importance \r\n  of having expert testimony for this case, and that Kent had recently located \r\n  a qualified expert.Â  The judge stated: â€œAs a general rule, weâ€™ve got to establish \r\n  all aspects of this case through expert testimony.â€Â  Then, instead of asking \r\n  Kent if he would like to move for a continuance, the trial judge directed his \r\n  query to Kemper Sportsâ€™ attorney, Stephen E. Darling.Â  The judge, referring \r\n  to the affidavit prepared by Kent which contained the expert witness information, \r\n  questioned Darling: â€œDo youâ€”out of an abundance of caution, do you want to allow \r\n  it to be heard or continue the Motion?â€Â  Darling responded: â€œNo, sir.â€Â  This \r\n  dialogue suggests the trial court understood Kent, as counsel for Schmidt, desired \r\n  a continuance to obtain the expertâ€™s affidavit but refused to grant him one \r\n  because Darling, as counsel for Kemper Sports, objected to the motion being \r\n  continued to a later date.\r\nII.Â  SUMMARY JUDGMENT\r\nWe find it extremely troubling this case was resolved \r\n  on a summary judgment basis, especially considering the injury to Schmidt and \r\n  the novel issue involved in this case.Â  No South Carolina cases discuss \r\n  the issue of personal injury from the impact of errant golf shots.\r\nMany South Carolina cases point out summary judgment is a â€œdrastic \r\n  remedyâ€ which should be cautiously invoked so no person will be improperly deprived \r\n  of a trial of the disputed factual issues.Â  Cunningham v.

Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 548 S.E.2d 854 (2001), \r\n  discussed the efficacy of Rule 56(f):\r\n\r\nRule 56(f) applies when it appears â€œfrom the affidavits of a party opposing \r\n  the motion that he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential \r\n  to justify his opposition.â€Â  Rule 56(f), SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  In such a \r\n  case, â€œthe court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance \r\n  to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery \r\n  to be had or may make such order as is just.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, Rule 56(f) \r\n  requires the party opposing summary judgment to at least present affidavits \r\n  explaining why he needs more time for discovery.\r\n\r\nId. at 321, 548 S.E.2d at 857.Â  The affidavit submitted by Kent is a \r\n  Rule 56(f) paradigmatic affidavit.\r\nThe analysis of Rule 56(f) as juxtaposed to the factual scenario \r\n  in this case involves whether:\r\n\r\n(1) the word â€œpartyâ€ encompasses an â€œattorneyâ€;\r\n(2) the affidavit is conclusory;\r\n(3) the two-day rule as articulated in Rule 56(c) does NOT \r\n  apply to a Rule 56(f) affidavit; and\r\n(4) the judge abused his discretion because he did not consider \r\n  the affidavit.\r\n\r\nParty/Attorney\r\nThe rule utilizes the word â€œpartyâ€ as the entity filing the affidavit \r\n  under Rule 56(f).Â  Schmidt asserts that the rule allows for an affidavit to \r\n  be submitted by the attorney.Â  In the instant case, the attorney is intimately \r\n  familiar with the reasons and justification for being unable to file an affidavit \r\n  of the expert witness.Â  Clearly, the attorney is in the best position to file \r\n  this affidavit rather than a party filing the affidavit on information provided \r\n  by the attorney.\r\nWe conclude that Rule 56(f) does allow and permit an â€œattorneyâ€ to \r\n  file an affidavit averring â€œthat he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit \r\n  facts essential to justify his opposition.â€Â  This construction is consonant \r\n  with the expressed intent of the rule to provide a procedure â€œ[w]hen [a]ffidavits \r\n  [a]re [u]navailable.â€\r\nAffidavit/Conclusory\r\nA review of the affidavit filed by Kent reveals gargantuan specificity \r\n  of facts and circumstances.Â  There is nothing in the affidavit that falls within \r\n  the definition of â€œconclusory.â€\r\nRule 56(c)/Rule 56(f)\r\nKemper Sports argues that the Kent affidavit was untimely because \r\n  it did not comply with the two-day rule mandated by Rule 56(c).Â  We reject this \r\n  contention.Â  The etymological format of Rule 56 demonstrates that a time limit \r\n  application is neither proper nor justified.\r\nAbuse of Discretion\r\nAt the conclusion of the summary judgment hearing, the judge found:\r\n\r\n[T]he affidavit has been reviewed.Â  The Court finds \r\n  that it was not timely submitted. . . . But, primarily, the Court \r\n  doesnâ€™t have to get there because thereâ€™s no affidavit thatâ€™s been filed timely, \r\n  pursuant to the Rules. . . . You didnâ€™t file it timely.Â  \r\n  Itâ€™s that simple.\r\n\r\nA circuit courtâ€™s failure to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  In re Robert M., 294 S.C. 69, 362 S.E.2d 639 (1987); State v.

App. 1997) (â€œWhen the trial judge \r\n  is vested with discretion, but his ruling reveals no discretion was, in fact, \r\n  exercised, an error of law has occurred.â€); Balloon Plantation, 303 S.C. \r\n  at 155, 399 S.E.2d at 441 (â€œIt is an equal abuse of discretion to refuse to \r\n  exercise discretionary authority when it is warranted as it is to exercise the \r\n  discretion improperly.â€).Â  The judge was mandatorily required to at least evaluate \r\n  and consider the affidavit.\r\nThe non-moving party in a motion for summary judgment â€œmust demonstrate the \r\n  likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence \r\n  and that the party is not merely engaged in a fishing expedition.â€Â  Dawkins \r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003) (internal quotation \r\n  marks omitted).Â  In Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. \r\n  101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991), the plaintiffs brought an action against a refinery \r\n  operator, alleging personal injury caused by pollution from the refinery.Â  Based \r\n  on an opinion letter by an expert that the injuries were consistent with exposure \r\n  to toxic substances, our Supreme Court ruled the trial judgeâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment was premature because further discovery, such as testing and analysis \r\n  of the medical conditions, would likely reveal additional relevant evidence.Â  \r\n  Id. at 112-13, 410 S.E.2d at 544.\r\nSimilarly, Kentâ€™s assertions at the hearing regarding the need for Pirklâ€™s \r\n  expert opinion, and the judgeâ€™s statement that expert testimony must be used \r\n  in this case, demonstrate the need for further discovery.Â  \r\nIn finding summary judgment was premature, the Baughman Court considered \r\n  the fact that the plaintiffs â€œwere not dilatory in seeking discovery . . . but \r\n  have been reasonably diligent in pursuit of a qualified expert to substantiate \r\n  their claims.â€Â  Id. at 113, 410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  The Court referenced \r\n  the plaintiffsâ€™ inability to obtain satisfactory responses to their interrogatories, \r\n  as well as the overall complexity of the case, which contributed to the difficulty \r\n  in finding an expert.Â  Id.\r\nThe trial judge in the present case did not feel Kent was â€œdilatoryâ€ in finding \r\n  Pirkl. Â As in Baughman, Schmidt did not receive responses to his discovery \r\n  requests.Â  In addition, the unusual facts of the case made it difficult to locate \r\n  an appropriate expert.Â  Kent declared that Pirkl, who resides in California, \r\n  â€œhas only had a website for a few months . . . [and he] didnâ€™t know of [Pirkl] \r\n  but since the beginning of last week.â€Â \r\nIn Middleborough Horizontal Prop. Regime Council v. Montedison, 320 \r\n  S.C. 470, 465 S.E.2d 765 (Ct. App. 1995), Montedison contended the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  grant of summary judgment was inappropriate inasmuch as it did not have a full \r\n  and fair opportunity to conduct discovery.Â  This Court disagreed:\r\n\r\nMontedison advances no good reason why four months was insufficient \r\n  time . . . to develop documentation in opposition to the motion for summary \r\n  judgment. . . . Further, the record discloses Montedison made no formal motion \r\n  for a continuance or pointed out in any specific manner how it would be prejudiced \r\n  by its inability to conduct discovery.\r\n\r\nId. at 479-80, 465 S.E.2d at 771.\r\nIn contrast, Kent asserted the difficulty in finding an expert on golf course \r\n  design and highlighted the inability to obtain responses to discovery requests.Â  \r\n  Kent pointed out it would be prejudicial to grant summary judgment on this novel \r\n  issue when he had an expert ready to testify.\r\nBecause this is a negligence claim, it is important to note that, â€œ[g]enerally, \r\n  negligence claims are not susceptible of summary adjudication because of the \r\n  many questions normally present in such cases concerning the reasonableness \r\n  of a partyâ€™s conduct, foreseeability, and proximate cause.â€Â  Folkens v. Hunt, \r\n  290 S.C. 194, 199, 348 S.E.2d 839, 842 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Concomitantly, we reverse \r\n  the grant of summary judgment.\r\nIII.Â  NEGLIGENCE\r\nAt the time the trial court prematurely granted summary \r\n  judgment, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the negligence of Kemper \r\n  Sports.\r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show the (1) \r\n  defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant breached the duty \r\n  by a negligent act or omission; (3) defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate \r\n  cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.Â  \r\n  Andrade v.

App. \r\n  2001) (amplifying that elements for negligence cause of action are: (1) duty \r\n  of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) defendantâ€™s breach of that duty \r\n  by negligent act or omission; and (3) damages to plaintiff proximately resulting \r\n  from breach of duty).\r\nTo sustain an action for negligence, it is essential \r\n  the plaintiff demonstrate the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the \r\n  plaintiff.Â  Sabb, 350 S.C. at 429, 567 S.E.2d at 237; Bishop v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998); Parks \r\n  v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 548 S.E.2d 605 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  Generally, duty is defined as the obligation to conform to a particular standard \r\n  of conduct toward another.Â  Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., 355 S.C. 329, \r\n  585 S.E.2d 275 (2003); Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 \r\n  S.C. 479, 238 S.E.2d 167 (1977); Hubbard v. Taylor, 339 S.C. 582, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 549 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The existence of a duty owed is a question of law \r\n  for the courts.Â  Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 548 S.E.2d 854 (2001); \r\n  Washington v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 523 S.E.2d 204 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  In a negligence action, if no duty exists, the defendant is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Huggins, 355 S.C. at 332, 585 S.E.2d \r\n  at 277; Simmons v. Tuomey Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 341 S.C. 32, 533 S.E.2d 312 \r\n  (2000).\r\nKemper Sports maintains it did not owe Schmidt a duty.Â  \r\n  Kemper Sports relies on the proposition that golf courses are not liable to \r\n  those injured by errant golf shots as long as the course is not unreasonably \r\n  unsafe.Â  A common theme runs throughout the cases cited by Kemper Sports.Â  The \r\n  cases involve injury to fellow golfers.\r\nFor example, in Campion v. Chicago Landscape Co., \r\n  14 N.E.2d 879 (Ill. App. Ct. 1938), a golfer was injured when another golfer \r\n  hooked his ball, causing it to come into the fairway where the plaintiff was \r\n  standing and strike him in the eye.Â  The court explained: â€œPersons operating \r\n  any golf course may reasonably expect that because of the somewhat dangerous \r\n  nature of the game, accidents may occur at any time; but to subject them to \r\n  liability for such an accident would make them insurers of all players \r\n  on the course.Â  This is not the law.â€Â  Id. at 883 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  The operative word in the courtâ€™s statement is â€œplayers.â€Â  Because the Campion \r\n  case involved another player being injured, it is not comparable to the \r\n  facts of the instant case.\r\nIn Petrich v. New Orleans City Park Improvement \r\n  Assâ€™n, 188 So. 199 (La. Ct. App. 1939), the plaintiff was playing golf when \r\n  a ball driven from a nearby tee struck and injured her.Â  The court held: â€œ[T]he \r\n  universally recognized custom and rule required each golfer to give warning \r\n  before driving a ball into the direction of someone else on the course, and \r\n  the [golf course operator] was justified in assuming that each golfer \r\n  would recognize and obey this custom.â€Â  Id. at 201 (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  The Petrich court emphasized the fact that the plaintiff was a golfer, \r\n  suggesting she assumed the risk of injury.\r\nTrauman v. City of New York, 143 N.Y.S.2d 467 \r\n  (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1955), cited by Kemper Sports, involved an action by a golfer.Â  \r\n  In contrariety, the case sub judice involves a third party on \r\n  adjacent premises.\r\nLikewise, in Baker v. Thibodaux, 470 So. 2d \r\n  245 (La. Ct. App. 1985), a golfer brought an action against the golf club and \r\n  another golfer for injuries sustained when he was struck in the eye by a golf \r\n  ball.Â  The court observed that the plaintiff, who was playing the 15th hole \r\n  at the time of the accident, had actual knowledge the defendant was ahead of \r\n  him on the 16th tee.Â  Id. at 249.Â  The court noted: â€œ[T]he risk of being \r\n  struck by an errant shot hit by a player on a contiguous or adjacent fairway \r\n  is â€˜a risk all golfers must accept.â€™â€Â  Id. (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  The facts of Baker differ substantially from those in the case at bar.Â  \r\n  Baker stands for the proposition that golfers assume the risk.\r\nIn contrast to these cases involving golfer-plaintiffs, \r\n  Schmidt was not playing golf at the time he was struck by the golf ball.Â  In \r\n  fact, Schmidt testified he does not play golf at all.Â  Additionally, Schmidt \r\n  stated during the time he worked on the house, he never saw â€œany other golf \r\n  balls come near [him].â€Â  Thus, it would be error to conclude Schmidt assumed \r\n  the risk of being struck by a golf ball.Â  There was no reason to believe a golf \r\n  ball would strike him while he was roofing the house.\r\nIn addition to the requirement that Schmidt prove the \r\n  existence and breach of a duty, Schmidt must show that Kemper Sportsâ€™ negligence \r\n  was the proximate cause of Schmidtâ€™s injury.Â  See Bishop v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998); Regions \r\n  Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  To prove \r\n  causation, a plaintiff must demonstrate both causation in fact and legal cause.Â  \r\n  Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d \r\n  271 (Ct. App. 2001); Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 605 (Ct. App. 2001); Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d \r\n  715 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Trivelas, \r\n  348 S.C. at 136, 558 S.E.2d at 276; McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, \r\n  499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  This Court, in Trivelas, summarized \r\n  the law regarding legal cause:\r\n\r\nLegal cause turns on the issue of foreseeability.Â  \r\n  An injury is foreseeable if it is the natural and probable consequence of a \r\n  breach of duty.Â  Foreseeability is not determined from hindsight, but rather \r\n  from the defendantâ€™s perspective at the time of the alleged breach.Â  It is not \r\n  necessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate the defendant should have foreseen \r\n  the particular event which occurred but merely that the defendant should have \r\n  foreseen his or her negligence would probably cause injury to someone.\r\n\r\nId. at 136, 558 S.E.2d at 276 (internal citations \r\n  and quotations omitted).\r\nBecause we find further discovery, especially expert \r\n  testimony, is essential to determine whether: (1) Kemper Sports owed a duty \r\n  to Schmidt and (2) Kemper Sportsâ€™ negligence was the proximate cause of Schmidtâ€™s \r\n  injury, the grant of summary judgment is reversed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough Kent did not specifically ask for a continuance, it is obvious \r\n  the trial judge understood the need for expert testimony in this case.Â  In totality, \r\n  we come to the ineluctable conclusion that genuine issues of material fact exist \r\n  in regard to the existence of any duty owed by Kemper Sports to Schmidt and \r\n  whether negligence on the part of Kemper Sports was the proximate cause of Schmidtâ€™s \r\n  injury.Â  Because additional discovery, especially in the form of expert opinion, \r\n  is needed to determine these issues, the trial court erred in granting Kemper \r\n  Sportsâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial \r\n  judge is\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n GOOLSBY, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The order of the circuit judge, as well as the first and second amended complaints, \r\n    reference August 27, 1998, as the date Schmidt was hit by the errant golf \r\n    ball.Â  However, the Appellantsâ€™ brief and the Respondentâ€™s brief provide that \r\n    August 28, 1998, was the date Schmidt was injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3720","title":"Quigley v.

Rider, M.D. and Medical Park Pediatricians, P.A. (collectively \r\n  â€œRiderâ€), alleging Rider committed malpractice by negligently administering \r\n  a second and third diptheria-pertussis-tetanus (â€œDPTâ€) shot to Kealy after she \r\n  displayed an adverse reaction to the first shot. \r\n  [1] Â  The circuit court dismissed the suit, holding the court did not have \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction because Kealyâ€™s injuries were vaccine-related and \r\n  were thus barred by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, \r\n  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 300aa-1 to 300aa-34 (1988 as amended) (â€œthe Actâ€). Donna Quigley \r\n  appeals on behalf of Kealy (â€œQuigleyâ€), arguing Kealyâ€™s injuries were not vaccine-related \r\n  and Rider is equitably estopped from asserting the Act as a bar to the litigation.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRider gave Kealy her first DPT shot in \r\n  December 1988.Â  Shortly thereafter, Kealy had adverse reactions to the shot.Â  \r\n  Quigley alleges that Rider knew of these adverse reactions but administered \r\n  a second and third DPT shot to Kealy, both of which manifested corresponding \r\n  adverse reactions.Â  Subsequently, Kealy was diagnosed with severe mental and \r\n  physical retardation, which Quigley attributes to the DPT shots.Â  \r\nQuigley filed this \r\n  action, alleging Rider was negligent by administering the second and third DPT \r\n  shots.Â  Additionally, the complaint alleged Rider negligently failed to: 1) \r\n  notify the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (â€œthe Secretaryâ€) \r\n  regarding Kealyâ€™s reactions to the shots pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 300aa-25(a) \r\n  &amp; (b); [2]  and 2) inform \r\n  Quigley of the dangers of the vaccine pursuant to 42 U.C.S.A. Â§Â§ 300aa-26(c) \r\n  &amp; (d). [3] Â  \r\nRider moved for dismissal, arguing the \r\n  circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.Â  The court \r\n  granted the motion, ruling the Act required Quigley to file a petition with \r\n  the Federal Claims Court prior to seeking state court remedies.Â  Quigley appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  General Overview of the Act\r\nCongress created the Act in 1986 for the purpose of establishing \r\n  an efficient scheme of recovery for injuries and deaths traceable to vaccines, \r\n  while providing protection for manufacturers and administrators of the vaccines.Â  \r\n  See H.R. Rep. No. 99-908, at 4 (1986), reprinted in, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. \r\n  6344, 6345 (â€œWhile most of the Nationâ€™s children enjoy greater benefit from \r\n  immunization programs, a small but significant number have been gravely injured. \r\n  These children are often without a source of payment or compensation for their \r\n  medical and rehabilitative needs, and they and their families have resorted \r\n  in greater numbers to the tort system for some form of financial relief.â€); \r\n  Shalala v. Whitecotton, 514 U.S. 268, 269-70 (1995) (citing H.R. Rep. \r\n  No. 99-908, at 3-7 (1986)) (â€œFor injuries and deaths traceable to vaccinations, \r\n  the Act establishes a scheme of recovery designed to work faster and with greater \r\n  ease than the civil tort system.â€); Schafer v. American Cyanamid Co., \r\n  20 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994) (â€œThe Act seeks to achieve its cost-reducing purpose, \r\n  not by denying compensation to victims . . . but by reducing the litigation \r\n  and insurance costs related to lengthy, complex tort procedures and random large \r\n  tort awards. The Act therefore imposes substantive and procedural limitations \r\n  upon tort actions.â€); see also H.R. Rep. No. 99- 908, at 6-7 (1986), \r\n  reprinted in, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6344, 6348-49 (stating one of the primary \r\n  purposes of the Act is to protect the vaccine market against the instability \r\n  and uncertainty of tort litigation).\r\nTo meet the clearly stated goals of Congress, \r\n  the Act provides a remedial scheme whereby a person who sustains vaccine-related \r\n  injuries after the effective date of the Act must apply to the Federal Claims \r\n  Court for compensation pursuant to the Act prior to seeking traditional tort \r\n  remedies through state and federal courts.Â  Â§Â§ 300aa-11(a)(2)(A)(i) and (ii); \r\n  see Shalala, 514 U.S. at 270 (citing Â§ 300aa-11) (â€œA claimant \r\n  alleging that more than $1,000 in damages resulted from a vaccination after \r\n  the Actâ€™s effective date in 1988 must exhaust the Actâ€™s procedures and refuse \r\n  to accept the resulting judgment before filing any de novo civil action \r\n  in state or federal court.â€) (emphasis as in original).Â  However, once an injured \r\n  person has appropriately applied to the Federal Claims Court under the Act and \r\n  received a judgment, the person may choose to accept the judgment or pursue \r\n  traditional tort remedies in state and federal court.Â  See Â§ 300aa-21(a).Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Vaccine-Related \r\n  Injury\r\nQuigley argues the circuit court erred \r\n  by dismissing Kealyâ€™s claims because Kealyâ€™s injuries are not â€œvaccine-related \r\n  injuriesâ€ within the scope of the Act.Â Â  Quigley contends although Kealyâ€™s injuries \r\n  from the first DPT shot were â€œvaccine-related injuries,â€ Kealyâ€™s injuries from \r\n  the second and third DPT shots were not because Riderâ€™s administrations of the \r\n  second and third DPT shots were intervening and superseding factors, breaking \r\n  the causal chain between the DPT shots and Kealyâ€™s injuries.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen the terms of a statute are clear \r\n  and unambiguous, our inquiry ends, and we are required to enforce the terms \r\n  of the statute as Congress drafted it. See United States v. Ron \r\n  Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241-42 (1989).\r\nSection 300aa-11(a)(2)(A) states the Act only applies \r\n  to a vaccine-related injury.Â  The Act defines â€œvaccine-related injuryâ€ as â€œan \r\n  illness, injury, condition, or death associated with one or more of the \r\n  vaccines set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table . . .â€ Â§ 300aa-33(5) (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nDPT is a vaccine listed within the Vaccine Injury \r\n  Table.Â  Â§ 300aa-14.Â  Furthermore, even under Quigleyâ€™s arguments, Kealyâ€™s injuries \r\n  are â€œassociated withâ€ the DPT shots. \r\n  [4] Â  Thus, under any view of the negligence alleged, Kealyâ€™s injuries are \r\n  â€œvaccine-related injuriesâ€ within the scope of the Act.Â  See Amendola \r\n  v. Secretary, Depâ€™t of Health and Human Servs., 989 F.2d 1180, 1186-87 (Fed. \r\n  Cir. 1993) (holding injuries arising from allegations of medical malpractice \r\n  stemming from multiple administrations of a vaccine within the Act are vaccine-related \r\n  injuries subject to the Act).Â  Therefore, we reject Quigleyâ€™s assertion the \r\n  claim against Rider is not vaccine-related.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Subject Matter \r\n  Jurisdiction\r\nQuigley argues the circuit court erred \r\n  by ruling the Act deprives state courts of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Quigley \r\n  contends the statute merely creates a remedial process that must ordinarily \r\n  be exhausted prior to a vaccine-related injury being brought in state court, \r\n  and because Rider failed to comply with Â§Â§ 300aa â€“25(d) and â€“26(c) &amp; (d), \r\n  he is equitably estopped from asserting the statute as a defense.Â Â Â  We disagree.\r\nWhere a state statute conflicts with or frustrates \r\n  federal law, the former must give way.Â  Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. \r\n  725, 746 (1981).Â  In the interest of avoiding unintended encroachment on the \r\n  authority of the states, however, a court interpreting a federal statute pertaining \r\n  to a subject traditionally governed by state law will be reluctant to find preemption. \r\n  Thus, preemption will not lie unless it is the clear and manifest purpose of \r\n  Congress.Â  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).Â Â  \r\n  Evidence of preemptive purpose is sought in the text and structure of the statute \r\n  at issue.Â  Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 95 (1983).\r\nFederal law may preempt state law in three ways:Â  \r\n  first, Congress may expressly define the extent to which it preempts state law; \r\n  second, Congress may occupy a field of regulation, impliedly preempting state \r\n  law; and third, a state law may be preempted to the extent it conflicts with \r\n  federal law.Â  Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Agricultural \r\n  Mktg. &amp; Bargaining Bd., 467 U.S. 461, 469 (1984).\r\nThe Act provides:\r\n\r\n(2)(A) No person may bring a civil action for damages in an \r\n  amount greater than $1,000 or in an unspecified amount against a vaccine administrator \r\n  . . . in a State . . . court for damages arising from a vaccine-relatedÂ Â Â Â  \r\n  injury . . . associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, \r\n  1988 . . . unless a petition has been filed, in accordance with section 300aa-16 \r\n  of this title . . . (B) If a civil action which is barred under subparagraph \r\n  (A) is filed in a State or Federal court, the court shall dismiss the action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 300aa-11(a). (emphasis added).Â  \r\nWe believe the statute states a clear and manifest \r\n  purpose of Congress to occupy and regulate the field of vaccination litigation \r\n  unless and until a plaintiff files suit in the Federal Claims Court and receives \r\n  a judgment.Â Â  Thus, it is unnecessary to determine if the statute removes subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction from state courts or merely requires an exhaustion of remedies.Â  \r\n  Rather, regardless of the characterization, the clear, unambiguous language \r\n  of the statute requires state courts to dismiss an action within the scope of \r\n  the Act unless the action has first been brought before the Federal Claims Court.Â  \r\n  See Shalala, 514 U.S. at 270 (â€œA claimant alleging that more than \r\n  $1,000 in damages resulted from a vaccination after the Actâ€™s effective date \r\n  in 1988 must exhaust the Actâ€™s procedures and refuse to accept the resulting \r\n  judgment before filing any de novo civil action in state or federal court.â€)Â  \r\n  (citing Â§ 300aa-11); Strauss v. American Home Prod. Corp., 208 F. Supp. \r\n  2d 711, 714 (2002) (â€œSimply put, individuals who qualify as Program claimants \r\n  must file petitions in the Vaccine Court in order to pursue any vaccine-related \r\n  claims at all.â€) (emphasis as in original).Â  \r\nIn the present case, it is uncontested Rider is \r\n  a vaccine administrator within the meaning of the Act.Â  Furthermore, it is uncontested \r\n  Quigley is attempting to bring a civil action for damages in excess of $1,000 \r\n  in state court, without having filed a petition pursuant to section 300aa-16, \r\n  for injuries sustained by Kealy after the effective date of the Act.Â  Consequently, \r\n  the Act required the circuit court to dismiss Quigleyâ€™s claims.Â  Because the \r\n  circuit court complied with the Act, we hold the circuit court did not err.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court, dismissing \r\n  Quigleyâ€™s claims is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Keith and Donna Quigley sued Rider in their individual capacities.Â  \r\n    The circuit court dismissed their claims for failure to comply with the applicable \r\n    statute of limitations.Â  Neither Keith nor Donna Quigley filed an appeal from \r\n    the dismissal of their claims.Â  Thus, although Keith and Donna Quigley are \r\n    listed as Appellants in their individual capacity, only Kealyâ€™s negligence \r\n    claims are the subject of this appeal.Â  Therefore, Keith and Donna Quigleyâ€™s \r\n    individual negligence claims against Rider are not addressed.Â  See \r\n    Bell v. Bennett, 307 S.C. 286, 294, 414 S.E.2d 786, 791 (Ct. App. 1992) \r\n    (holding an issue which is not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned on \r\n    appeal); Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered \r\n    which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Pursuant to the Act, vaccine administrators are required to make \r\n    a permanent record of the vaccination.Â  Â§ 300aa-25(a).Â  Additionally, they \r\n    are required to report to the Secretary â€œthe occurrence of any event set forth \r\n    in the Vaccine Injury Table . . . the occurrence of any contraindicating reaction \r\n    to a vaccine which is specified in the manufacturerâ€™s package insert . . . \r\n    and such other matters as the Secretary may by regulation require.â€Â  Â§ 300aa-25(b).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] The Act requires vaccine \r\n    administrators to provide information to the legal guardians of any child \r\n    receiving a DPT shot.Â  The information must include the benefits of the vaccine, \r\n    the risks associated with the vaccine, and the availability of the Act.Â  Â§Â§ \r\n    300aa-26(c) &amp; (d).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  During oral arguments, Quigley acknowledged Kealyâ€™s injuries are \r\n    associated with the DPT shots but argued Riderâ€™s negligence was the paramount \r\n    cause of Kealyâ€™s injuries.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
