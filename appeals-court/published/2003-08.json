McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles \r\n  H. Richardson, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Walter M. Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Monroe Roger Rudd, II, was \r\n  convicted of committing a lewd act on a child.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial \r\n  court erred in overruling defense counselâ€™s objections to statements made by \r\n  the solicitor during closing arguments. We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRudd lived with Mother and \r\n  her eight-year-old daughter, Victim, for approximately seven years.Â  Motherâ€™s \r\n  job often required her to work the night shift, leaving Rudd to care for Victim.Â  \r\n  Victim testified that one evening, when Rudd and Victim were alone together, \r\n  Rudd asked her to rub his head, which she did.Â  Rudd then allegedly pushed her \r\n  hand down to his chest and to his stomach.Â  She stated: â€œAnd he kept pushing \r\n  . . . my hand to his private part and then I felt it.â€ \r\nVictim also testified that in separate incidents \r\n  Rudd had her completely disrobe and lie down on the bathroom floor before getting \r\n  into the shower.Â  She stated that Rudd asked her to spread her legs while he \r\n  examined her genitals without penetrating her vagina.Â  Victim testified that \r\n  Ruddâ€™s fingernails were painful to her.Â  According to Victim, Rudd told her \r\n  that he was examining her in an effort to determine whether she had developed \r\n  an infection.Â  Rudd allegedly performed these examinations approximately \r\n  twice a week.Â  \r\nFinally, Victim testified that Rudd had showered \r\n  with her on a prior occasion.Â  She stated that both she and Rudd were naked \r\n  at the time.Â  She testified that Rudd helped her wash and rinse her hair because \r\n  she had difficulty rinsing out all of the shampoo.Â Â  \r\nOn March 6, 2001, Victim reported to school officials \r\n  that Rudd had sexually assaulted her between the months of December 2000 and \r\n  January 2001.Â  Mother was called to the school and was present when Victim \r\n  disclosed the alleged misconduct. \r\nThe State charged Rudd with first-degree \r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor as well as committing a lewd act upon a \r\n  child.Â  At trial, several of the Stateâ€™s witnesses testified that Victim told \r\n  them identical stories of the circumstances surrounding the alleged assaults.Â  \r\n  Mother testified that she learned of the assaults from Victim when she arrived \r\n  at the school where Victim first raised the allegations.Â  Later that day, Victim \r\n  affirmed her account of the alleged assaults while speaking with Patrolman Hubert \r\n  Prince of the Dorchester County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  Detective Thomas Marshall \r\n  also testified that Victimâ€™s reports to him were consistent with her earlier \r\n  accounts to Patrolman Prince, Mother, and an account appearing in the Low Country \r\n  Childrenâ€™s Center reports.Â  Victimâ€™s grandmother testified Victim told her about \r\n  the sexual assaults, and it appeared that Victim was consistent in recalling \r\n  the circumstances surrounding the incidents.Â  Several healthcare professionals \r\n  also testified that Victim related to them the same specifics of the alleged \r\n  assaults.Â  \r\nAt trial, Rudd testified in his \r\n  defense.Â  He admitted having washed Victimâ€™s hair, but claimed only to have \r\n  been treating her for head lice.Â  He also testified to examining Victimâ€™s genitals \r\n  after she allegedly injured herself on a bicycle seat.Â  However, Rudd denied \r\n  ever being nude with Victim in the shower and he denied touching her improperly.Â  \r\n  Rudd also denied putting Victimâ€™s hand on his genitals.\r\nAt issue in this case \r\n  are two separate comments made by the solicitor during her closing argument \r\n  before the jury.Â  First, the solicitor began her closing argument by stating:\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the defenseâ€™s argument is \r\n  what we call the old cotton candy defense. . . . Reminds you of going to the \r\n  fair when youâ€™re a child, you see the cotton candy, it looks nice and sweet \r\n  and something good.Â  When you get right down to it basically itâ€™s a lot of sugar \r\n  spun up with hot air.\r\n\r\nRuddâ€™s counsel objected to this comment as improper \r\n  and as â€œa scurrilous, at home and personal attack against opposing counsel.â€Â  \r\n  The trial court overruled the objection.\r\nAt a later point in her closing argument, the solicitor \r\n  told the jury:\r\n\r\nA child is not sophisticated enough to fool everybody, ladies \r\n  and gentlemen.Â  The defendant has had many protections before he gets into this \r\n  court of law to face you jurors.Â  First of all, [Victim] would have to fool \r\n  Deputy Prince, Lowcountry Childrenâ€™s Center, [and] Detective Marshall, who gets \r\n  a warrant, has a magistrate sign a warrant.Â  Thereâ€™s a preliminary hearing before \r\n  a magistrate before its bound over, thereâ€™s a grand jury that true bills or \r\n  no bills an indictment before this case is ever brought to you.Â  So certainly \r\n  a childâ€™s story -- a child is not sophisticated enough to fool all these people. \r\n\r\n\r\nDefense counsel objected, arguing the solicitor had improperly \r\n  commented on prior procedures.Â  The trial court again overruled counselâ€™s objection.Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury acquitted Rudd of first-degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor, but convicted him of committing a lewd act upon \r\n  a child. Â Rudd was sentenced to a term of twelve years in prison. Â This \r\n  appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the trial court err in determining the solicitorâ€™s statement, which compared \r\n  the defenseâ€™s argument to cotton candy, did not amount to an improper personal \r\n  attack on defense counsel?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial \r\n  court err in determining the solicitorâ€™s reference to prior procedures did not \r\n  improperly reference preliminary determinations of fact?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appropriateness of a solicitorâ€™s closing argument \r\n  is a matter left to the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion. State v. Copeland, \r\n  321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996).Â  An appellate court will not \r\n  disturb a trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding closing argument unless there is an \r\n  abuse of that discretion. State v. Penland, 275 S.C. 537, 539, 273 S.E.2d \r\n  765, 766 (1981). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nRudd argues that the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  comparison of Ruddâ€™s defense to cotton candy amounted to an improper personal \r\n  attack on defense counsel.Â  Accordingly, Rudd insists the trial court erred \r\n  in overruling defense counselâ€™s objection to the statement. We disagree.\r\nA solicitorâ€™s closing argument \r\n  must be carefully tailored so it does not appeal to the personal biases of the \r\n  jurors.Â  Copeland, 321 S.C. at 324, 468 S.E.2d at 624; State v. Linder, \r\n  276 S.C. 304, 312, 278 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981). Further, the argument must not \r\n  be calculated to arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or prejudices, and its content \r\n  should stay within the record and reasonable inferences to it.Â  Simmons v. \r\n  State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998).Â  It is improper for \r\n  the solicitor to express before the jury his or her personal judgment about \r\n  opposing counsel.Â  State v. Lunsford, 318 S.C. 241, 246-47, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  918, 922 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nHere, the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  by overruling Ruddâ€™s objection to the solicitorâ€™s comparison of Ruddâ€™s defense \r\n  to cotton candy.Â  The solicitor is entitled, within reason, to question the \r\n  credibility of Ruddâ€™s defense.Â  See Lunsford, 318 S.C. at 246, \r\n  456 S.E.2d at 922 (â€œIn telling the jury, â€˜so donâ€™t fall for that,â€™ the solicitor \r\n  was merely telling the jury that it should not credit defense counselâ€™s argument \r\n  regarding the absence of fingerprint evidence.â€).Â  Counsel may fairly point \r\n  out matters that the jury should not consider.Â  Id.Â Â Â  In Ruddâ€™s case, \r\n  the solicitorâ€™s comment did not express her personal judgment about defense \r\n  counsel; rather, her statement merely invited the jury to find Ruddâ€™s assertions \r\n  at trial lacked credibility.Â  \r\nII.\r\nRudd next contends the solicitorâ€™s reference \r\n  to prior procedures constituted an improper reference to preliminary determinations \r\n  of fact.Â  We agree.\r\nOur supreme court has repeatedly \r\n  condemned closing arguments that lessen the juryâ€™s sense of responsibility by \r\n  referencing preliminary determinations of the facts.Â  See, e.g., State \r\n  v. Thomas, 287 S.C. 411, 412, 339 S.E.2d 129 (1986) (citing Thompson \r\n  v. Aiken, 281 S.C. 239, 315 S.E.2d 110 (1984)); State v. Sloan, 278 \r\n  S.C. 435, 298 S.E.2d 92 (1982); State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170, 284 S.E.2d \r\n  357 (1981)).Â  â€œThese statements to the jury are improper because they inject \r\n  an arbitrary factor into jury deliberations.Â  The danger is that a juror might \r\n  be persuaded to rely on the opinion of others instead of exercising his independent \r\n  judgment as to the facts. . . .â€Â  Thomas, 287 S.C. at 412-13, 339 S.E.2d \r\n  at 129.\r\nHere, the solicitor told the jury that \r\n  Rudd â€œhas had many protections before he gets into this court of law to face \r\n  you jurors.â€Â  The solicitor then informed the jury that, in addition to numerous \r\n  others who had examined Victimâ€™s allegations, a preliminary hearing was held \r\n  before a magistrate, and the case had been presented to a grand jury.Â  It is \r\n  irrelevant that the solicitorâ€™s intent may have been to simply emphasize that \r\n  Victimâ€™s story had remained consistent throughout the investigation.Â  A statement \r\n  of this type could have improperly lessened a jurorâ€™s sense of responsibility \r\n  to independently determine the facts of this case by permitting him or her to \r\n  rely on the opinions of the investigators, the magistrate, and the grand jury.Â  \r\n  See Thomas, 287 S.C. at 412, 339 S.E.2d at 129 (condemning solicitorâ€™s \r\n  comment that the case had already been examined by a magistrate and a grand \r\n  jury, and that a preliminary hearing had been held).Â  Accordingly, we hold the \r\n  trial court abused its discretion by overruling Ruddâ€™s objection to this improper \r\n  statement.Â  \r\nHowever, improper comments do not require reversal \r\n  if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.Â  Johnson v. State, 325 \r\n  S.C. 182, 187, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  On appeal, an appellate court will \r\n  review the alleged impropriety of the solicitorâ€™s argument in the context of \r\n  the entire record, including whether the trial judgeâ€™s instructions adequately \r\n  cured the improper argument and whether there is overwhelming evidence of the \r\n  defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  Copeland, 321 S.C. at 324, 468 S.E.2d at 624-25; \r\n  State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 326, 360 S.E.2d 317, 320 (1987).Â  The \r\n  appropriate determination is whether the solicitorâ€™s comment so infected the \r\n  trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  \r\n  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997). \r\nVictim alone provided the substantive \r\n  testimony against Rudd.Â  The Stateâ€™s other witnesses testified only that Victim \r\n  told them about the assaults and that her account was consistent as to the time \r\n  and place the events allegedly occurred.Â  Rudd denied sexually assaulting Victim \r\n  and testified that he only examined her to determine if she was injured in a \r\n  bicycle accident.Â  The juryâ€™s verdict ultimately depended upon whether they \r\n  believed Victimâ€™s story was credible.Â  Under these circumstances, the evidence \r\n  of Ruddâ€™s guilt is not overwhelming; thus, we find the solicitorâ€™s comment was \r\n  unfairly prejudicial to Rudd. [1] \r\n  Â Â  As the supreme court has warned: â€œWe caution solicitors that arguments \r\n  of this kind can rarely be harmless.â€Â  Thomas, 287 S.C. at 413, 339 S.E.2d \r\n  at 129.\r\nMoreover, we do not believe the trial courtâ€™s jury charge \r\n  cured the error.Â  The trial court instructed the jurors to decide the case according \r\n  to the testimony of sworn witnesses and other evidence without regard to any \r\n  arbitrary factors.Â  However, the trial court made no reference to the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  comment regarding the â€œmany protectionsâ€ Rudd had received prior to the trial \r\n  or the prior examinations by the magistrate, the grand jury, and others.Â  The \r\n  trial courtâ€™s instruction to the jury was insufficient to cure the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  improper comment.Â  Considering the solicitorâ€™s closing argument in the context \r\n  of the entire record, we cannot say the trial courtâ€™s error in allowing the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s improper comment was harmless. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ruddâ€™s conviction \r\n  is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nCONNOR and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  The State submits that because the jurors acquitted Rudd of the \r\n    CSC charge, they could not have been prejudicially affected by the solicitorâ€™s \r\n    comments.Â  We find this argument unpersuasive.Â  It is impossible for this \r\n    court to determine what effect the solicitorâ€™s comment may have had on the \r\n    minds of the jurors.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3669","title":"Pittman v.

Lowther appeals the \r\n  order of the circuit court granting a private prescriptive easement across his \r\n  land to Harold Pittman.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWeldon Wall purchased Good Hope Plantation \r\n  from Good Hope Corporation.Â  At that time, a very old system of trails and plantation \r\n  roads traversed the entire tract.Â  One such plantation road was Wellington Road, \r\n  leading into the plantation from U.S. Highway 278.Â  The entire road system was \r\n  shown on the plat referenced in the deed.Â  In 1973, Wall subdivided Good Hope \r\n  into two parcels:Â  Parcel A consisting of 2,340.8 acres and Parcel&nbsp;B containing \r\n  661.33 acres.Â  Wall sold Parcel A to Pittman.Â  The plat referenced in this deed \r\n  did not show Wellington Road or any of the other plantation roads. \r\n Mary Wilcox later purchased Parcel B at \r\n  a foreclosure sale.Â  Wilcox assigned a portion of her bid on Parcel B to Pittman \r\n  and in 1975 Pittman purchased 279 acres out of Parcel B.Â  Pittman converted \r\n  a hunting lodge located on the property into a home.Â  This property was referred \r\n  to in the testimony as the â€œhouse tract.â€Â  On three sides, the â€œhouse tractâ€ \r\n  was bordered by the 2,340.8 acre parcel already owned by Pittman.Â  The remaining \r\n  portion of Parcel B, held by Wilcox, abutted the fourth side of the tract.Â  \r\n  The â€œhouse tractâ€ did not abut any public road.Â  Both Parcel A and Wilcoxâ€™s \r\n  land abutted U.S. Highway 278.Â  \r\nSince May of 1973, Pittman used Wellington \r\n  Road to travel from Highway 278 to a trailer on Parcel A.Â  At the time he purchased \r\n  the â€œhouse tractâ€ in 1975, his only access to that property was also Wellington \r\n  Road. [1] Â  After the 1975 purchase, Pittman continued to use Wellington \r\n  Road to reach Parcel A and as a driveway to his home on the â€œhouse tract.â€Â  \r\n  A portion of the road passed over Wilcoxâ€™s land before it joined U.S. Highway \r\n  278.Â  \r\nWilcox sold her remaining portion of Parcel \r\n  B consisting of 312.11 acres to Lowther in 1976.Â  About five or six years later, \r\n  Lowther began to place obstacles in Wellington Road in an effort to close the \r\n  portion which traversed his property. [2] Â  Pittman either drove around \r\n  the obstacles or cut or pushed them down to travel the road to Highway 278.Â  \r\n  This scenario was repeated numerous times.Â  \r\nPittman stopped using the road for approximately \r\n  four or five months in 1992 while a mutual friend attempted to mediate the dispute.Â  \r\n  After the friend told Pittman his settlement attempts were unsuccessful, Pittman \r\n  promptly pushed up the wires and cables across the road and continued to travel \r\n  across it to Highway 278.Â  In the early fall of 1997, Lowther requested his \r\n  attorney write to Mr. Pittman and instruct him to stay off his property and \r\n  the disputed section of the road.Â  Pittman ignored the letter and destroyed \r\n  the barriers blocking the road.Â  Lowther called a deputy sheriff out to observe \r\n  the damage and instruct Pittman to stay off of his land.Â  This litigation ensued.Â  \r\n\r\n The original Wellington Road and a separate, \r\n  newer county road, some 200 feet farther up, run roughly parallel to one another \r\n  leading off Highway 278 into the old Good Hope land and towards the Lowther \r\n  and Pittman properties.Â  About 300 feet from Highway 278, the new county road \r\n  merges into the original Wellington Road and runs for some unknown distance \r\n  to the edge of a particular lot belonging to Lowther.Â  Lowther dedicated this \r\n  portion of Wellington Road to the county.Â  A final portion of the original road \r\n  continues on for another 168 feet running along the edge of Lowtherâ€™s property \r\n  until it meets the gate to Pittmanâ€™s â€œhouse tract.â€Â  It is this last 168 feet \r\n  of Wellington Road that remains in controversy. [3] Â  \r\nPittman brought an action to declare an \r\n  easement by prescription, necessity, or dedication across 168 feet of Wellington \r\n  Road running through Lowtherâ€™s land.Â  After a bench trial, the court issued \r\n  an order granting Pittman a private prescriptive easement over Wellington Road \r\n  providing access to Highway 278 across Lowtherâ€™s property.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Continuous and Uninterrupted Use\r\nLowther argues the trial court erred in \r\n  concluding Pittman established a private prescriptive easement because the evidence \r\n  does not support a factual finding that Pittmanâ€™s adverse use was continuous \r\n  and uninterrupted.Â  Because the trial court reached inconsistent factual findings, \r\n  it erred in concluding Pittmanâ€™s use was continuous and uninterrupted during \r\n  the alleged prescriptive period. [4] \r\n  Â  \r\nâ€œThe determination of the existence of an easement \r\n  is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an any evidence standard \r\n  of review when tried by a judge without a jury.â€Â  Slear v. Hanna, 329 \r\n  S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  The trial court relied upon the \r\n  following standard set forth in Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  420, 423 (Ct. App. 1997) to find that Pittman should be granted a prescriptive \r\n  easement.Â  â€œTo establish a prescriptive easement, one must show:Â  (1) continued \r\n  use for 20 years, (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed, and (3) use which is \r\n  adverse or under claim of right. Id.Â  (citing Horry County v. Laychur, \r\n  315 S.C. 364, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993)).Â  Laychur, however, emphasized as \r\n  to the first prerequisite not only that there must be a continued use for twenty \r\n  years, there must be â€œcontinued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of \r\n  the right for a period of 20 years.â€Â  Laychur, 315 S.C. at 368, 434 S.E.2d \r\n  at 261 (emphasis added). [5] Â  The uninterrupted requirement is the focal \r\n  point here.Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s order stated the only \r\n  interruption in Pittmanâ€™s use of the challenged portion of Wellington Road was \r\n  during the failed mediation.Â  However, the court also found Pittman had broken \r\n  open more than $2,000 worth of barriers costing approximately $200 each â€œexercising \r\n  his perceived right to use the road.â€Â  The barriers the trial court mentioned \r\n  were erected by Lowther specifically for the purpose of preventing Pittman from \r\n  utilizing the roadway, and not merely for Lowtherâ€™s own use or convenience.Â  \r\n  On direct examination, Mr. Pittman was asked if he had used the road uninterruptedly \r\n  from the time he bought the tract, and he responded, â€œNot completely.â€Â  He stated \r\n  that five or six years after the Lowthers bought the adjoining property, they \r\n  started putting obstacles in the way trying to close the road, but that he â€œpushed \r\n  them down or went around them . . . .â€Â  He also testified the Lowthers later \r\n  â€œput up gates and put up cables,â€ but after the attempted mediation failed, \r\n  he pushed down the wire and cable the Lowthers had erected across the road.Â  \r\n\r\nMitchell Lowther testified regarding efforts made \r\n  to prevent Pittman from using the road.Â  In addition to setting posts and bolting \r\n  cables across it, the road was plowed every year and planted with rye a couple \r\n  of years.Â  Lowther testified he tried to be a good neighbor and, when he found \r\n  Pittman had driven around a cable or pushed a cable down, he would calmly put \r\n  the cable back up to try to cause as little problem as possible.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  he eventually reported Pittmanâ€™s actions to law enforcement and had a deputy \r\n  come see where Pittman had used his tractor to not only push over posts and \r\n  cables, but uproot a couple of small trees and scrape the road with his tractor.Â  \r\n  Pittman stipulated that he had done so.Â  \r\nLowtherâ€™s repeated attempts to prevent Pittman \r\n  from crossing Lowtherâ€™s land constitute interruptions, however brief, in Pittmanâ€™s \r\n  use and enjoyment of that portion of Wellington Road.Â  See 25 Am. Jur. \r\n  2d, Easements Â§ 69 (1996) (â€œAny unambiguous act of the owner of the land \r\n  which evinces his intention to exclude others from the uninterrupted use of \r\n  the right claimed breaks its continuity so as to prevent the acquisition of \r\n  an easement therein by prescription . . . .Â  Though the mere erection of gates \r\n  by the servient owner for the greater convenience of his operations, and not \r\n  as a barrier to passage, will not defeat a claim to a prescriptive easement \r\n  of passage, an easement of way cannot arise by prescription if the owner of \r\n  the servient estate has habitually broken or interrupted its use at will by \r\n  the maintenance of gates.â€) (footnotes omitted).Â  Therefore, the trial court \r\n  erred in concluding Pittman enjoyed uninterrupted adverse use of the land for \r\n  the 20-year period necessary to establish an easement by prescription.Â  \r\nII.Â  Easement by Dedication\r\nAs an alternate sustaining ground, Pittman urges us \r\n  to find the existence of an easement by dedication.Â  The record is devoid of \r\n  evidence to support this contention.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is generally held that when the owner of land \r\n  has it subdivided and platted into lots and streets and sells and conveys the \r\n  lots with reference to the plat, he thereby dedicates said streets to the use \r\n  of such lot owners, their successors in title, and the public.â€Â  Blue Ridge \r\n  Realty Co. v. Williamson, 247 S.C. 112, 118, 145 S.E.2d 922, 924-25 (1965).Â  \r\n  â€œTwo elements are required to perfect [public] dedication.Â  First, the owner \r\n  must express in a positive and unmistakable manner the intention to dedicate \r\n  his property to public use.Â  Second, there must be acceptance of such property \r\n  by the public.â€Â  Laychur, 315 S.C. at 368, 434 S.E.2d at 261.Â  However, \r\n  as between the original landowner and his grantee, the dedication is complete \r\n  when the conveyance is made.Â  Blue Ridge Realty Co., 247 S.C. at 119, \r\n  145 S.E.2d at 925.Â  \r\nPittman does not clearly indicate whether \r\n  the purported easement by dedication is public or private.Â  However, the distinction \r\n  is without consequence because there is no evidence any prior landowner intended \r\n  to dedicate an easement in the use of Wellington Road.Â  Pittman argues the plat \r\n  referenced in the deed when he purchased the 2,340 acre tract from Wall shows \r\n  part of Wellington Road, including a part of the 168 feet in dispute.Â  However, \r\n  as one of Pittmanâ€™s own witnesses testified, the plat created for that sale \r\n  does not show Wellington Road. Â Nor is it shown on the plat referenced \r\n  in the deed conveying the 279 acre tract to Pittman.Â  \r\nTwo plats in the record do show Wellington Road.Â  \r\n  The first was the one created for and referenced in the conveyance of the entire \r\n  3,000 acres from Good Hope Corporation to Wall.Â  This plat shows the entire \r\n  plantationâ€™s road system.Â  However, because the plat was not created as part \r\n  of a subdivision of the land, the display of the old plantation roads cannot \r\n  be considered a positive and unmistakable intention to dedicate them to the \r\n  public.Â  Even though this plat is also referenced in the 2,340 acre deed from \r\n  Wall to Pittman, the absence of roads on the plat created specifically for that \r\n  conveyance belies the existence of a dedication of Wellington Road to either \r\n  the public or Pittman individually.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The second plat that shows Wellington \r\n  Road was created when Wall was planning to subdivide and sell at auction the \r\n  land adjoining Pittmanâ€™s 279 acre tract.Â  The auction was held, but Lowther \r\n  offered more than the combined individual lot bids and thus purchased the entire \r\n  tract. Â The subdivision was never created.Â  Furthermore, although the \r\n  plat was referenced in the deed conveying the property to Lowther, the deed \r\n  specifically states the reference was for the purpose of describing the outside \r\n  boundaries, and was not intended to suggest a subdivision was being transferred.Â  \r\n  Thus, the existence of this document also falls short of a positive and unmistakable \r\n  intention to dedicate an easement over Wellington Road.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nPittman failed to establish a prescriptive easement \r\n  in the challenged portion of Wellington Road because his use was not continuous \r\n  and uninterrupted for the requisite period.Â  Pittman also failed to establish \r\n  an easement by dedication because the evidence does not demonstrate \r\n  an express intent by any of the prior landowners to create such.Â  For these \r\n  reasons, the order on appeal is \r\n REVERSED.\r\nCURETON \r\n  and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The â€œhouse tractâ€ deed granted Pittman an express 20-foot \r\n    access easement to Highway 278.Â  Pittman never used the easement for a driveway \r\n    to his home.Â  He testified that he had negotiated for the easement for the \r\n    sole purpose of getting a mowing machine in behind a fence.Â  Five or six big \r\n    live oak trees stand in the path of the easement and would have to be felled \r\n    to create a road.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Pittman testified that about four or five years after he bought \r\n    the â€œhouse tractâ€ he built a road from a trailer located on the adjoining \r\n    Parcel A out to U.S. Highway 278.Â  At some point thereafter he constructed \r\n    a driveway connecting his home on the â€œhouse tractâ€ to that road.Â  This provided \r\n    an alternate route at about the time the Lowthers began to obstruct Wellington \r\n    Road.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]\r\n   Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Lowthers \r\n    are developing a subdivision on their property.Â  The disputed portion of Wellington \r\n    Road runs across 168.83 feet of a lot designated as lot # 12.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because we hold Pittman did not enjoy continuous and uninterrupted \r\n    use of the road segment in question, we need not address Lowtherâ€™s other arguments \r\n    concerning the existence or extent of the claimed easement.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  See generally Hartley v.

Pillsbury, Yacobi &amp; Pillsbury, LLC, of Greenville, for \r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Rose Mary McGregor, S.C. Dept. of Social Services, of Columbia, for \r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Sue Tennis appeals from an \r\n  order of the circuit court affirming the Department of Social Servicesâ€™ (DSS) \r\n  denial of her application to renew her license to operate a day care facility.Â  \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS \r\nSue Tennisâ€™s history with DSS dates back to 1986.Â  \r\n  In that year, DSS â€œindicated a caseâ€ against Tennis for sexual abuse; that case \r\n  was ultimately dismissed.Â  In 1991, Tennis applied to DSS for a day care license, \r\n  which DSS denied.Â  This denial was overturned by the family court in 1992 in \r\n  an order that stated: â€œDSS did not produce one shred of credible evidence as \r\n  to why Tennisâ€™s application should be denied.â€ Since that order, Tennis has \r\n  operated the Carousel of Learning day care facility under a provisional license \r\n  issued by DSS.Â  Until this action, her provisional license has been renewed \r\n  each time it expired.Â  \r\nTennis changed the location of her day care in \r\n  1995.Â  When she moved, her previous landlord filed charges against her because \r\n  she removed playground equipment and left behind about a dozen holes on the \r\n  property.Â Â Â  Tennis pled guilty to malicious injury to property by a tenant, \r\n  which is a misdemeanor.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-11-570 (stating that \r\n  the injury or destruction of buildings or crops by a tenant is a misdemeanor). \r\n\r\nDSS made unannounced visits to Carousel of Learning \r\n  on June 4, August 5, and October 9, 1997. No deficiencies were found \r\n  on any of these visits.Â  On October 13, 1997, DSS sent Tennis a notice, which \r\n  stated:Â  â€œThe Division of Child Day Care Licensing and Regulatory Services has \r\n  been notified by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division that you . . . \r\n  have been convicted of a crime which prevents employment in a child day care \r\n  facility.â€Â  DSS was mistaken, however, because the crime to which Tennis pled \r\n  guilty was a misdemeanor and as such, did not prevent her from employment in \r\n  a day care facility. [1]  \r\nIn December of 1997, DSS visited Carousel of Learning in \r\n  response to an anonymous complaint.Â  The complaint was not substantiated and \r\n  no deficiencies were noted.Â  Another unannounced visit was made on February \r\n  2, 1998.Â  Again, no deficiencies were found.Â  \r\nOn May 21, 1998, DSS visited the facility and cited it for three violations:Â  \r\n  (1) having only one caregiver on the premises with 15 children; (2) not designating \r\n  a director; and (3) failing to meet the fire codes because four infants were \r\n  in a room not designated for infants.Â  At the time of this visit, DSS was operating \r\n  under the false assumption that Tennis was a convicted felon who could not work \r\n  at a day care facility.Â  Thus, even when Tennis was at the facility, she was \r\n  not counted as a supervisor or counted in the child-to-staff ratios.Â  If Tennis \r\n  had been present on May 21, the only deficiency would have been the four infants \r\n  in a non-designated room.Â  \r\nAgain on June 23, 1998, DSS made an unannounced \r\n  visit and found inappropriate ratios.Â  However, Tennis was at the facility that \r\n  day and was not counted toward these ratios.\r\nOn July 24, 1998, Tennis initiated a meeting with \r\n  DSS in order to clear up the confusion regarding her guilty plea.Â  She brought \r\n  in papers that listed S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-570 as the statute under which \r\n  she pled guilty. That statute explicitly states that malicious injury to property \r\n  by a tenant is a misdemeanor.Â  Despite this meeting, DSS maintained its position \r\n  that Tennisâ€™s criminal background prevented her from being employed at the day \r\n  care.Â  \r\nFrom August of 1998 until November of 1999, DSS \r\n  made numerous unannounced visits to Tennisâ€™s day care.Â  DSS found no deficiencies \r\n  on five of those visits. [2] Â  \r\n  On four of the visits in which deficiencies were found, there would have been \r\n  no deficiency if DSS had counted Tennis toward the child-to-staff ratios. [3] Â  On two visits, however, there were confirmed \r\n  violations regardless of whether Tennis was counted.Â  These violations occurred \r\n  on July 15 and July 30, 1999. \r\nDuring the July 15, 1999 visit, DSS found two caregivers \r\n  in one room with twenty-four children.Â  The room was designated for only twelve \r\n  children.Â  Tennis admitted the violation but explained that her facility was \r\n  short-handed because an employee had quit unexpectedly.Â  On July 30, 1999, DSS \r\n  found violations because there were fourteen children in a room designated for \r\n  twelve, a caregiver did not have her fingerprints on file, no menu was posted, \r\n  and the sleeping mats were not labeled.Â  DSS also found that there was no designated \r\n  director and there were inadequate child-to-staff ratios; however, it is unclear \r\n  whether these violations would have existed had Tennis been counted.Â  In regards \r\n  to the missing fingerprints, Tennis explained the employee in violation was \r\n  a recent high school graduate who was enrolled in early childhood development \r\n  classes at the local community college. To be enrolled in these classes, students \r\n  needed to submit their fingerprints to SLED, and Tennis assumed that the employee \r\n  had already been fingerprinted. The employee eventually did submit her fingerprints, \r\n  and she had no criminal history.\r\nIn November of 1999, DSS sent Tennis a letter denying \r\n  Tennisâ€™s application for renewal of her day care license.Â  The letter listed \r\n  the following as the basis for denial:\r\n\r\n  1. Ms. Sue Tennis, owner of the facility, continues to provide direct care \r\n    for children after having been notified by certified mail on October 3, 1997 \r\n    (sic) and August 17, 1998, that she had been convicted of a crime which prevented \r\n    her from employment in a child day care facility per Section 20-7-2725 of \r\n    the 1976 Code of Laws of South Carolina as amended.\r\n  2. The facility has continued to employ a caregiver, Ms. Wendy Wilson, in \r\n    direct care of children who failed to undergo a State and Federal fingerprint \r\n    review in violation of Section 20-7-2740 (F) of the South Carolina Day Care \r\n    Licensing Law.\r\n  3. The operator has failed to correct deficiencies within the time frames \r\n    prescribed by the Department after being given timely notice per Section 20-7-2750 \r\n    (D) of the South Carolina Day Care Licensing Law.Â  Inadequate supervision \r\n    was found on visits by Department staff on February 12, 1997, May 23, 1997, \r\n    May 21, 1998, June 23, 1998, August 18, 1998, April 12, 1999, July 15, 1999, \r\n    July 20, 1999, and July 30, 1999.\r\n\r\nAfter sending this letter, DSS made two additional \r\n  unannounced visits in March and April of 2000, and found no violations on either \r\n  visit.Â  Finally, on August 16, 2000, a hearing was held.Â  \r\nIn the Final Administrative Order, the State Director \r\n  of DSS found that DSS properly denied the renewal based on the violations from \r\n  July 15, 1999 and July 30, 1999.Â  The director found the health and safety of \r\n  the children in the day care were placed in jeopardy by the failure to maintain \r\n  adequate staffing ratios and the failure to have a caregiver submit to a fingerprint \r\n  check.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court reviewed the case and found that \r\n  the decision to deny the renewal was based upon â€œinadequate ratios and other \r\n  regulatory non-compliance issues as noted in the Final Administrative Order.Â  \r\n  On the two dates in question, severe ratio deficiencies were found.â€Â  The court \r\n  acknowledged that DSS had improperly excluded Tennis when calculating supervision \r\n  ratios but concluded the â€œagencyâ€™s determination was not tainted by any error \r\n  of law, was not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable and substantial evidence \r\n  presented, and was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.â€Â Â  This \r\n  appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nUnder the APA, â€œ[t]his court will not substitute \r\n  its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact.â€Â  Leventis v.

Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2002); Ballenger, \r\n  331 S.C. at 251, 500 S.E.2d at 185). \r\nâ€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of \r\n  evidence nor evidence viewed blindly from one side, but is evidence which, when \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion that the agency reached.â€Â  Waters v.

(citing Hamm v. AT&amp;T, 302 S.C. 210, 394 S.E.2d 842 (1990)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Denial of \r\n  Tennisâ€™s Day Care License Renewal\r\nTennis maintains there was not substantial evidence \r\n  to support the directorâ€™s decision not to renew her license.Â  She contends the \r\n  decision was arbitrary and based upon DSSâ€™s incorrect assumption that she was \r\n  convicted of a felony.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nLooking at the record as a whole, the overwhelming \r\n  evidence indicates DSS repeatedly cited Tennis for violations that were not \r\n  truly violations.Â  Nearly every month for two years, DSS made unannounced visits \r\n  to the day care center, and several months, DSS visited more than one time.Â  \r\n  These visits were often predicated on DSSâ€™s incorrect assessment that child- \r\n  to-staff ratios at the facility were inadequate when in fact, if DSS had counted \r\n  Tennis toward those ratios, there would have been no violation. In light of \r\n  that error and considering Tennisâ€™s history with DSS, the evidence on the whole \r\n  record reflects a history of DSSâ€™s bias against Tennis.\r\nIn its letter to Tennis notifying her of its decision \r\n  to deny the renewal of her license, DSS lists Tennisâ€™s status as a felon as \r\n  its first reason for non-renewal.Â  The record, however, clearly indicates that \r\n  Tennis was not a felon.\r\nThe next reason for denial listed in the letter is \r\n  the â€œcontinued [employment of] a caregiver . . . in direct care of children \r\n  who failed to undergo a State and Federal fingerprint review . . . .â€Â  At the \r\n  hearing, Tennis admitted this violation, explained how it happened, and presented \r\n  evidence that the caregiver was fingerprinted after she had been cited for this \r\n  violation.Â  The fingerprinting results revealed the caregiver had no criminal \r\n  record.Â Â  \r\nFinally, the letter refers to dates upon which DSS \r\n  made visits and found violations.Â  At least one date listed was not even a day \r\n  upon which a visit was made, [4]  and a majority of the dates listed \r\n  would not have been violations if DSS had counted Tennis in its child-to-staff \r\n  ratios. \r\nUpon consideration of the entire record, we hold the \r\n  decision of DSS to deny Tennisâ€™s renewal of her day care license was clearly \r\n  erroneous in light of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.Â  In \r\n  1992, the family court found DSS presented â€œnot one shredâ€ of evidence supporting \r\n  the denial of Tennisâ€™s license.Â  Since then, it appears DSS has attempted to \r\n  bolster its case against Tennis by making frequent unannounced visits and repeatedly \r\n  citing her for violations that did not exist.Â  Based on this history, we do \r\n  not believe the violations on July 15th and July 30th amount to â€œsubstantialâ€ \r\n  or â€œreliableâ€ evidence.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nTennis next argues that if the circuit courtâ€™s decision \r\n  is reversed, she is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to S.C. Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 \r\n  (Supp. 2002).Â  Under that statute, a party defending an action brought by the \r\n  State may recover attorneyâ€™s fees and costs if three prerequisites are met: \r\n  first, the contesting party must be the prevailing party; second, the court \r\n  must find that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing \r\n  its claim against the party; and third, the court must find that there are no \r\n  special circumstances that would make the award of attorney's fees unjust.Â  \r\n  Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 96, 567 S.E.2dÂ  260, 264 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  Based on our decision to reverse the denial of Tennisâ€™s day care \r\n  license and there being no evidence that makes the award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  unjust, we find Tennis is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees incurred during the litigation \r\n  pursuant to Â§ 15-77-300.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3671\r\n  Heard June 25, 2003 â€“ Filed \r\n  August 11, 2003 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Cynthia B. Polk, of Columbia, \r\n          for Appellant.\r\n        E. Courtney Gruber and R. \r\n          Walter Hundely, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, \r\n  C.J.: In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the commission found that Anthony \r\n  Whiteâ€™s claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.Â  White appealed \r\n  to the circuit court, which reversed the commission, finding Whiteâ€™s claim was \r\n  not barred by the statute of limitations, and awarded benefits. Whiteâ€™s employer, \r\n  the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) appeals, arguing the circuit \r\n  court erred in (1) not dismissing the claim for Whiteâ€™s failure to set forth \r\n  sufficient grounds for appeal in his petition for judicial review; (2) finding \r\n  the commissionâ€™s decision was not supported by substantial evidence; and (3) \r\n  determining that MUSC was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations \r\n  as a defense.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\nWhite \r\n  worked at MUSC as an operating room technician/nursing assistant.Â  His job duties \r\n  included removing trash bins from the operating room, moving equipment, lifting \r\n  patients, and transporting patients to and from other rooms.Â  Larger patients \r\n  were transported by way of a 1500- pound bed called a â€œbig-boyâ€ bed.Â  \r\nIn 1997, \r\n  White complained to his supervisor that he had hurt himself, and he sought medical \r\n  treatment from Dr. G.T. Little, complaining primarily of poor circulation in \r\n  his legs.Â  Dr. Littleâ€™s notes from that day indicated that White also complained \r\n  of severe lower back pain; however, the notes further stated that White â€œhad \r\n  no injuries to the back that [White] is aware of.â€Â  The injury did not prevent \r\n  White from returning to work, nor was White put on any light duty restrictions \r\n  or work restrictions. \r\nThe record \r\n  indicates White went to his family physician, Dr. F.C. Walker, on February 2, \r\n  1999.Â  Dr. Walker treated White for flu symptoms and noted that White complained \r\n  â€œof some back pain in the lower thorax.â€Â  White again saw Dr. Walker on February \r\n  26, 1999, and Dr. Walkerâ€™s notes indicated that White was experiencing some \r\n  back pain at that time. White also saw Dr. Walker on November 1, 1999, and on \r\n  that date he complained of muscular thoracic pain.Â  \r\nOn April \r\n  12, 2000, White saw Dr. Elizabeth Rittenberg for low back pain radiating into \r\n  both legs.Â  In her report, Dr. Rittenberg noted that White had had low back \r\n  pain for several years but it had gotten worse in the three weeks prior to his \r\n  visit.Â  In her notes from a visit on April 24, 2000, Dr. Rittenberg stated that \r\n  an MRI scan of White showed a small midline L4, 5 disc herniation.Â  \r\nWhite \r\n  filed a Form 50 seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits on December 6, 2000.Â  \r\n  The single commissioner denied the claim, finding it was barred by the two-year \r\n  statute of limitations. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2002).Â  The full commission \r\n  affirmed.Â  White appealed to the circuit court, which reversed and remanded \r\n  the matter back to the commission.Â  The circuit court found a reasonable person \r\n  would not have been on notice that he suffered a work-related claim prior to \r\n  April 2000.Â  Because it found the statute of limitations did not begin to run \r\n  until that date, the circuit court found Whiteâ€™s claim was not barred. Â The \r\n  court also found that substantial evidence existed to support Whiteâ€™s position \r\n  that he suffered a disc herniation as a result of repetitive trauma.Â  MUSC appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\nâ€œThe South Carolina Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions \r\n  of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.â€Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 \r\n  S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 94-95 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Gibson v. Spartanburg \r\n  Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000);Â  Hamilton \r\n  v. Bob Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 518 S.E.2d 599 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  â€œIn \r\n  an appeal from the Commission, this Court may not substitute its judgment for \r\n  that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, \r\n  but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.â€Â  Corbin, \r\n  351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95 (citing Hamilton, 336 S.C. at 76, 518 \r\n  S.E.2d at 601).Â Â  â€œThe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled \r\n  by some error of law.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe findings of an administrative agency \r\n  are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial \r\n  evidence.â€ Id. (citing Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, 335 S.C. \r\n  46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. \r\n  488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nI. Sufficiency \r\n  of Whiteâ€™s Notice of Appeal\r\nMUSC \r\n  first argues Whiteâ€™s appeal should have been dismissed by the circuit court \r\n  for failure to set forth sufficient grounds for appeal in his petition for review.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe commission adopted the single \r\n  commissionerâ€™s order, which concluded as a matter of law that White had not \r\n  met the two-year statute of limitations.Â  The commission thus denied the claim.Â  \r\n  In his notice of appeal, White stated the following exception to the ruling: \r\n  â€œThe Full Commission erred in finding as a fact and concluding as a matter of \r\n  law that the Claimant was not entitled to benefits under the South Carolina \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.â€Â  \r\nSection \r\n  42-17-60 of the South Carolina Code (1985) states that â€œ[n]otice of appeal [to \r\n  the circuit court from the commission] must state the grounds of the appeal \r\n  or the alleged errors of law.â€Â  In Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 \r\n  S.C. 518, 415 S.E.2d 841 (Ct. App. 1992), an injured workerâ€™s exception that \r\n  â€œthe facts found by the commission were not supported by credible evidenceâ€ \r\n  was specific enough to satisfy the notice requirements of section 42-17-60. \r\n  [1] Â  Whiteâ€™s exception, attacking the commissionâ€™s findings of fact and \r\n  conclusions of law, is substantially similar to the one upheld in Solomon.Â  \r\n  \r\nIn Whiteâ€™s \r\n  case, the commissionâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law only addressed \r\n  the statute of limitations issue; thus, Whiteâ€™s notice of appeal was sufficient \r\n  to direct the circuit court to the error complained of and allow the court to \r\n  determine whether the ruling was erroneous.Â  Both the court and MUSC were on \r\n  notice that White believed the commission erred in finding he was not entitled \r\n  to benefits.Â  Thus, we find no error.\r\nII. Statute \r\n  of Limitations\r\nMUSC \r\n  next argues the circuit court erred in finding the commissionâ€™s decision was \r\n  not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe commission \r\n  found that Whiteâ€™s claim was barred by the statute of limitations because White \r\n  â€œeither knew or should have known that repetitive lifting of patients and gurneys \r\n  was causing injury to his back as far back as 1997.â€Â  In reversing the commission, \r\n  the circuit court found, inter alia, there was substantial evidence to \r\n  support Whiteâ€™s position that he suffered disc herniation as a result of repetitive \r\n  trauma.Â  \r\nA repetitive \r\n  trauma injury has a â€œgradual onset caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive \r\n  traumatic events or â€˜mini-accidents.â€™â€ Schulknight v. City of N. Charleston, \r\n  352 S.C. 175, 178, 574 S.E.2d 194, 195 (2002). In Schulknight, a firefighter \r\n  sought workersâ€™ compensation benefits for hearing loss he suffered from sitting \r\n  next to the fire siren and air horn while he rode in the fire truck.Â  The firefighter \r\n  had a hearing test in April of 1995, which indicated he had suffered noise-induced \r\n  hearing loss.Â  Despite this hearing loss, the doctor administering the test \r\n  concluded the firefighter could still perform his job.Â  Over the next two years, \r\n  the firefighter was diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss from noise exposure \r\n  and was told that in approximately ten years, he would need hearing aids.Â  Id. \r\n  at 176, 574 S.E.2d at 194-195.Â Â  The firefighter left the fire department in \r\n  August of 1997, and in May of 1998, he filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\n  The full commission found the two-year statute of limitations had run because \r\n  the firefighter knew he had work-induced hearing loss since May of 1995.Â  Id. \r\n  at 177, 574 S.E.2d at 195.Â  The supreme court reversed, finding the firefighterâ€™s \r\n  injury was caused by repetitive trauma.Â  The court noted that â€œit is difficult \r\n  to determine the date an accident occurs in a repetitive trauma case because \r\n  there is no definite time of injury.â€ Â Id.Â  The court went on to â€œhold \r\n  the last day of exposure is the date from which the statute of limitations begins \r\n  to run in a repetitive trauma case.â€Â  Id. at 179, 574 S.E.2d at 196.Â Â  \r\n  \r\nIn the present case, although White \r\n  complained of back pain in 1997, his injury was not severe enough at that time \r\n  to warrant any change to his duties at work. As White continued to lift heavy \r\n  equipment and patients at work, his back pain worsened, and eventually, he was \r\n  diagnosed with a disc herniation and ordered not to lift heavy objects.  [2] Â  Thus, even if substantial evidence supported \r\n  the commissionâ€™s determination that White knew since 1997 that his back pain \r\n  was work-related, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the \r\n  last day of exposure - Whiteâ€™s last day of work in April of 2000. Id.Â  \r\n  \r\nWe agree with the circuit court that \r\n  substantial evidence supports the finding that Whiteâ€™s injury was the result \r\n  of repetitive trauma, which arose out of and in the course of Whiteâ€™s employment.Â  \r\n  Thus, the circuit court correctly found that the statute of limitations had \r\n  not run and White is entitled to workersâ€™ compensation benefits.

Dyna-Color/Jack \r\n  Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992) (stating that the policy in South \r\n  Carolina is to liberally construe the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in favor of \r\n  coverage); Gattis v. Chavez, 413 F. Supp. 33, 39 (D.S.C. 1976) (â€œStatutes \r\n  of limitation which are susceptible to judicial construction should not be applied \r\n  mechanically but rather construed in the manner most consistent with both their \r\n  underlying purposes and the requirements of substantial justice for all parties \r\n  involved.â€)Â  \r\nAccordingly, \r\n  based on the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, J.J. concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Solomonâ€™s other two exceptions, that the â€œdecision of the commission \r\n    failed to address all the exceptions and points of law brought before the \r\n    commissionâ€ and â€œupon such further exception as will hereafter be served,â€ \r\n    were not sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of section 42-17-60. \r\n    Solomon, 307 S.C. at 522, 415 S.E.2d at 844.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  According to Dr. Rittenberg, â€œwithin a reasonable degree of medical \r\n    certainty . . . [Whiteâ€™s] job duties [were] of such a nature that they could \r\n    have aggravated or exacerbated his pre-existing chronic back pain [from 1997], \r\n    ultimately resulting in disc herniation.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Because we find the statute of limitations has \r\n    not run, we need not address the issue of estoppel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3672","title":"Gilbert v.

Johnson, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:&nbsp; Patsy Ann Gilbert filed \r\n  suit against Marvin Miller and Millerâ€™s landlord, Toya Abbatiello, to recover \r\n  for personal injuries sustained by Gilbert after being bitten by Millerâ€™s dog.Â  \r\n  Abbatiello filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The \r\n  trial court granted Abbatielloâ€™s motion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMiller resides with his dog at an apartment complex \r\n  owned by Abbatiello.Â  Millerâ€™s dog attacked Gilbert while she was visiting at \r\n  another tenantâ€™s apartment. [1]  \r\n \r\n\r\nGilbert filed suit against Miller and Abbatiello.Â  \r\n  Gilbert alleged in her complaint that Abbatiello was negligent in â€œallowing \r\n  Miller to keep a vicious dog on her premises despite . . . a policy of no dogs \r\n  kept by tenants except for small dogs.â€Â  The complaint did not refer to any \r\n  lease agreement and did not allege any duty on the part of Abbatiello.\r\nAbbatiello moved to dismiss the complaint against \r\n  her based on Gilbertâ€™s failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \r\n  of action upon which relief can be granted.Â  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The trial \r\n  court granted Abbatielloâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGilbert correctly asserts \r\n  the trial court converted Abbatielloâ€™s Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for \r\n  summary judgment by reviewing matters outside of the pleadings.Â  The trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order referred to Abbatielloâ€™s motion as a motion to dismiss pursuant Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion is converted to a Rule 56, SCRCP, motion for \r\n  summary judgment if â€œmatters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded \r\n  by the Court . . . .â€Â  Rule 12(b), SCRCP.Â  \r\nGilbert submitted affidavits, photographs, and \r\n  a copy of the lease agreement in her response to Abbatielloâ€™s motion.Â  Abbatiello \r\n  did not object to their inclusion and the trial court specifically mentioned \r\n  the lease agreement and Patsy Chambersâ€™ affidavit in its order.Â  Therefore, \r\n  Abbatielloâ€™s Rule 12(b)(6) motion was converted to a motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  See Benson v. United Guar. Residential Ins. of Iowa, 315 S.C. \r\n  504, 445 S.E.2d 647 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding where the trial court considers \r\n  matters outside the pleadings the motion to dismiss is converted to one for \r\n  summary judgment).\r\nWhen reviewing a dismissal of an action under Rule \r\n  56, SCRCP, an appellate court applies the same standard of review implemented \r\n  by the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  \r\n  A trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  only when there is no genuine issue of material fact so that the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  All ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed against the movant.Â  \r\n  Id.Â Â  \r\nÂ LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.\r\nGilbert argues the trial court erred by dismissing \r\n  her complaint on the basis that a landlord is not liable for injuries caused \r\n  by a tenantâ€™s dog kept on leased premises.\r\nIn Mitchell v. Bazzle, 304 S.C. 402, 404 \r\n  S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1991), we first addressed a landlordâ€™s liability for injuries \r\n  inflicted by a tenantâ€™s dog.Â  The â€œclear questionâ€ presented in Mitchell \r\n  was whether South Carolina law â€œimposed a duty on [landlord] to [plaintiff] \r\n  to terminate [tenant]â€™s month-to-month lease in order to remove [tenant]â€™s dog \r\n  from the land.â€Â  Id. at 404, 404 S.E.2d at 911.Â  We held a landlord could \r\n  not be vicariously liable under the common law for the actions of a tenantâ€™s \r\n  dog even where the landlord knew of the animalâ€™s vicious propensities and could \r\n  have foreseen the injury, had adequate time to terminate a month-to-month tenancy, \r\n  and failed to terminate the lease.Â  Id. at 404-05, 404 S.E.2d at 911-12. [2] Â  \r\nIn Fair v. United States, 334 S.C. 321, \r\n  513 S.E.2d 616 (1999), our Supreme Court analyzed the question of whether the \r\n  South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (RLTA) \r\n  [3]  altered the common law rule espoused in Mitchell.Â  The Court \r\n  held that under the RLTA a landlord is liable only for defects relating to the \r\n  inherent physical state of the leased premises.Â  Fair, 334 S.C. at 323-24, \r\n  513 S.E.2d at 617.Â  Therefore, the RTLA â€œdoes not alter the common law rule \r\n  that a landlord is not liable to a tenantâ€™s invitee for injury caused by a tenantâ€™s \r\n  dog.â€Â  Id.; see Bruce v. Durney, 341 S.C. 563, 534 S.E.2d \r\n  720 (Ct. App. 2000) (recognizing and reaffirming the principle of law stated \r\n  in Fair and Mitchell).\r\nSince there is no dispute over any material facts, \r\n  the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.Â  Abbatiello was entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law because South Carolina law does not recognize \r\n  holding a landlord vicariously liable for the actions of a tenantâ€™s dog.\r\nB.\r\nHowever, this does not end the inquiry.Â  \r\n  Gilbert also contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for \r\n  Abbatiello because the lease agreement between Abbatiello and Miller created \r\n  a duty of care for the landlord to prevent harm by a tenantâ€™s dog.Â  See \r\n  Miller v. City of Camden, 317 S.C. 28, 451 S.E.2d 401 (Ct. App. 1994), \r\n  affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 310, 494 S.E.2d 813 (1997) (stating an affirmative \r\n  legal duty to act can exist if created by contract).Â  The lease provided:\r\n\r\nPets must meet the approval of \r\n  the landlord and appropriate additional deposits may be required.Â  Dogs will \r\n  not be allowed in multifamily units.Â  Continuous disturbances or complaints, \r\n  such as odors, fleas or messes caused by the pet, will result in the deposit \r\n  being forfeited along with additional monies to correct the problems and the \r\n  animal must leave the premises.Â  If it is necessary to hire a pest eradicator \r\n  because of a flea problem the tenant will pay the cost.Â  The tenant will also \r\n  be responsible for any damage caused by the pet and must be in full control \r\n  of the pet at all times.\r\n\r\nInitially, Gilbert did not allege, and there is \r\n  no evidence in the record, she entered into a lease agreement like the one between \r\n  Abbatiello and Miller.Â  Thus, in the absence of any allegation that Gilbert \r\n  entered into an identical lease, it is impossible to say, as Gilbert claims \r\n  in her brief, the â€œlease could be relied upon by other tenants in entering their \r\n  lease as assurance that their premises (and guests) would be free of the presence \r\n  ofâ€ a vicious dog.Â Â  See Bob Hammond Const. Co. v. Banks Const. Co., \r\n  312 S.C. 422, 440 S.E.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating a third person not in \r\n  privity of contract with the contracting parties generally may not enforce the \r\n  provisions of a contract unless it is entered into for the benefit of the third \r\n  person).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThis Court dealt with the creation \r\n  of a duty by a lease in Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, \r\n  329 S.C. 433, 494 S.E.2d 827 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Goode was attacked while visiting \r\n  a friend at an apartment complex.Â  One of his attackers resided at the apartment \r\n  complex.\r\nGoode sued the landlord (St. \r\n  Stephens) asserting St. Stephens was negligent in failing to provide security.Â  \r\n  Goode alleged he was a third party beneficiary under the lease agreement in \r\n  which tenants agreed not to engage in unlawful conduct on the grounds of the \r\n  apartment complex.Â  Thus, Goode argued the lease created a duty for St. Stephens \r\n  to protect him from attack by third parties.Â  Id. at 445, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  at 833.Â  \r\nUpon examination of the lease \r\n  provision, we concluded St. Stephens did not owe a duty of care to Goode because \r\n  he was not a third party beneficiary under the contract.Â  We concluded that \r\n  if St. Stephens did not â€œcovenant to prevent or to protect tenants from \r\n  the violent acts of other tenants or third partiesâ€ it surely â€œcould not have \r\n  intended to create such a benefit directly in favor of Goode.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  446, 494 S.E.2d at 833. \r\nThe main guide in contract interpretation is to \r\n  ascertain and give legal effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed \r\n  in the language of the lease.Â  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart \r\n  Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 413 S.E.2d 866 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  If a contractâ€™s \r\n  language is clear and capable of legal construction, this Courtâ€™s function is \r\n  to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties as found in the \r\n  agreement.Â  Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 543 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  A clear and explicit contract must be construed according to the \r\n  terms the parties have used, with the terms to be taken and understood in their \r\n  plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v. Litchfield, \r\n  313 S.C. 471, 438 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1993).Â Â  \r\nIt is clear the language of the \r\n  lease did not intend to make Gilbert, as either a tenant or a guest, a third \r\n  party beneficiary by imposing a duty in tort on the landlord to prevent a tenantâ€™s \r\n  dog from injuring another.Â  The lease provision cannot be construed as being \r\n  for the protection of other tenants or guests.Â  A review of the lease provision \r\n  shows its primary purpose was to prevent damage to the property or disruption \r\n  of the physical habitability of the apartment complex by a tenantâ€™s pet.Â  This \r\n  is evident from the provisionâ€™s use of the general term â€œpetsâ€ rather than â€œdogs.â€ \r\n  [4] Â  This provision could refer to any pet, not only dogs, and demonstrates \r\n  Abbatiello did not contract to protect others from dogs on the premises.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe lease provisionâ€™s concern \r\n  rested in ensuring any tenant who kept a pet would be responsible for any mess \r\n  or sanitary problems caused by the animal.Â  Importantly, the lease explicitly \r\n  made the control of the pet the sole responsibility of the tenant, not the landlord.Â  \r\n  See Braun v. York Props., Inc., 583 N.W.2d 503 (Mich. Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (finding landlord had no duty to protect others from attack by a tenantâ€™s \r\n  dog even where landlord had promulgated rules and regulations governing tenantsâ€™ \r\n  possession of dogs; the primary purpose of the rules was to protect against \r\n  harm to the premises); cf. Alaskan Village, Inc. v. Smalley, 720 \r\n  P.2d 945 (Alaska 1986) (finding landlord had undertaken a specific duty to protect \r\n  others from tenantâ€™s vicious dog and could be found liable where lease specifically \r\n  prohibited tenants from keeping â€œvicious dogsâ€).Â  \r\nThe landlord here has not contracted \r\n  to remove pets unless there have been continuous disturbances or complaints.Â  \r\n  Abbatiello had not received any complaints about Millerâ€™s dog other than her \r\n  own observation â€œa couple of daysâ€ before the attack of the dog â€œraging and \r\n  rearing up.â€Â  The lease provision prohibiting pets in multifamily units was \r\n  not equivalent to a promise creating a duty on the part of Abbatiello to keep \r\n  the premises free from pets or vicious dogs.Â  Moreover, there is no evidence \r\n  Abbatiello permitted Miller to keep the dog in the multifamily unit, or knew \r\n  of any intention by Miller to keep a pet at his unit, at the time the lease \r\n  was entered into. [5]   \r\nOur opinion in Mitchell \r\n  is also instructive in determining whether the lease created a duty of care \r\n  for Abbatiello to prevent harm by a tenantâ€™s dog.Â  Mitchell, 304 S.C. \r\n  at 404-05, 404 S.E.2d at 911-12.Â  In holding that the law did not impose a duty \r\n  on the landlord based on the circumstances present in Mitchell, we clearly \r\n  implied that a landlord is not liable even where a landlord has some form of \r\n  control, i.e., termination of the lease, over a tenantâ€™s dog.Â  But \r\n  see FOC Lawshe Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Intâ€™l Paper Co., 352 S.C. 408, 414, \r\n  574 S.E.2d 228, 231 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œIn Mitchell, this court found that \r\n  even though the landlord knew of the dogâ€™s viciousness, had adequate time to \r\n  terminate the tenantâ€™s lease, and failed to terminate the tenantâ€™s lease, the \r\n  landlord was not liable for the acts of the tenantâ€™s dog over which the landlord \r\n  had no control.â€) (emphasis added).\r\nThe trial court did not err in \r\n  finding the lease did not alter the common law rule that a landlord is not liable \r\n  to a third party for injuries caused by a tenantâ€™s dog.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing \r\n  analysis, the order of the trial court granting summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  The record is unclear concerning whether Gilbert is also a tenant \r\n    at the apartment complex.Â  Patsy Chambers, whose mother lives in the complex, \r\n    stated in her affidavit that Gilbert â€œcame to my motherâ€™s house to pick upâ€ \r\n    her child.Â  Gilbertâ€™s affidavit merely states she was attacked â€œwhile at the \r\n    home of Patsy Chambersâ€™ mother.â€Â  Furthermore, Gilbertâ€™s brief states the \r\n    issue on appeal is whether a landlord can be liable for an injury to a â€œguestâ€ \r\n    inflicted by a tenantâ€™s dog.Â  However, Gilbertâ€™s complaint states she was \r\n    â€œtalking with a neighborâ€ when she was attacked by Millerâ€™s dog.Â  Abbatiello \r\n    admitted the facts as stated in Gilbertâ€™s complaint for the purposes of her \r\n    motion to dismiss.Â  Given our standard of review and Abbatielloâ€™s admission, \r\n    we resolve this ambiguity against Abbatiello and will assume the attack occurred \r\n    while Gilbert, a tenant, was a guest at another tenantâ€™s apartment.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  But see Cronin v. Chrosniak, 536 N.Y.S.2d 287 (N.Y. \r\n    App. Div. 1988) (finding summary judgment improperly granted to landlord where \r\n    landlord knew of dogâ€™s vicious propensities and had capability to remove dog \r\n    by terminating month-to-month lease); Vasques v. Lopez, 509 So. 2d \r\n    1241 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (reversing a grant of directed verdict for \r\n    defendant landlord where the jury could have inferred actual knowledge of \r\n    the dogâ€™s vicious propensities and the landlordâ€™s control over the premises \r\n    based on the landlordâ€™s right to terminate a week-to-week tenancy and evict \r\n    the tenant).Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-40-10 to -940 (1991 &amp; \r\n    Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â  Dogs are referred to only in relation to their prohibition in multifamily \r\n    units.Â  We construe this prohibition to be only for the benefit of the landlord \r\n    and the prevention of a nuisance, such as a dog barking or pet odors, to the \r\n    adjoining lessee in a multifamily unit because the next sentence of the lease \r\n    provision addresses â€œcontinuous disturbances or complaints, such as odors, \r\n    fleas or messes caused by the pet . . . .â€Â  See Oâ€™Cain v. Oâ€™Cain, \r\n    322 S.C. 551, 473 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating a private nuisance is \r\n    an unreasonable interference with the plaintiffâ€™s use and enjoyment of the \r\n    land).Â  Further support for this is found in another paragraph of the lease \r\n    mandating that â€œmultifamily units must maintain lower noise levels after 11:00 \r\n    PM so as not to disturb other tenants.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5] Â  In this case, the only evidence of Abbatielloâ€™s knowledge of the \r\n    dog indicates she learned of the dog â€œa couple of daysâ€ before the attack.Â  \r\n    This limited time period would have been insufficient for Abbatiello to have \r\n    evicted Miller and abated any hazard, given the record does not specify the \r\n    term of the lease.Â  A landlordâ€™s power to evict a tenant is restrained by \r\n    the statutory termination notice period.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-770 \r\n    (1991) (providing for the termination of periodic tenancies by the landlord \r\n    after giving written notice to the tenant); see also Feister v. \r\n    Bosack, 497 N.W.2d 522, 525-26 (Mich.

Leeds Barroll, IV, of Columbia, John O. McDougall, of Sumter, \r\n  John S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJ. Mark Taylor, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  John E. Miles (â€œHusbandâ€) \r\n  brought this action seeking termination or, alternatively, reduction in his \r\n  alimony obligation to Rachel M. Miles (â€œWifeâ€).Â  The family court refused to \r\n  terminate, but did reduce Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation from $4,583 per month \r\n  to $2,500 per month.Â  Husband appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nBackground\r\nThe parties married in 1962 and divorced in 1995.Â  \r\n  As part of the divorce decree, the family court adopted a written agreement \r\n  between the parties in which Husband agreed to pay Wife $4,583 in monthly alimony.Â  \r\n  The agreement further provided:\r\n\r\n[T]he terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any Order \r\n  approving the same, shall not be modifiable by the parties or any Court without \r\n  the written consent of Husband and Wife. Â The parties specifically agree \r\n  that the Family Court . . . shall not have any jurisdiction to modify, supplement, \r\n  terminate or amend this Agreement, or the rights and obligations of the parties.Â  \r\n  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to in any way prohibit the Family \r\n  Court from the modification and/or termination of the alimony provisions of \r\n  this Agreement as permitted pursuant to the law of the State of South Carolina. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 2000, Husband brought this \r\n  action against Wife seeking termination or reduction in his alimony due to a \r\n  substantial change of circumstances.Â  Husband alleged that Wife orally agreed \r\n  to modify the partiesâ€™ prior alimony agreement, and that Wife had entered into \r\n  a relationship that was tantamount to marriage or was a common law marriage, \r\n  such that alimony should be terminated.Â  \r\nWife testified she had been involved in \r\n  a relationship with Anthony Shepard since her divorce from Husband.Â  Wife testified \r\n  she and Shepard spend three to four nights a week together.Â  Wife and Shepard \r\n  often travel together and they maintain a joint traveling fund to which each \r\n  contributes $150 per month.Â  Wife described her relationship with Shepard as \r\n  â€œclose, personal, and emotional.â€Â  Wife testified she did not consider herself \r\n  married to Shepard, and denied she and Shepard had schemed to remain unmarried \r\n  to avoid losing her alimony.Â  Additionally, Wife testified she and Shepard maintain \r\n  separate residences and checking accounts and do not have any joint investment \r\n  or charge accounts.Â  Wife did, however, make a one time loan to Shepard for \r\n  $9,000, which Shepard repaid within a few days.Â  \r\nWife testified Husband approached her \r\n  in April of 1997 and discussed his intent to file an action to discontinue alimony \r\n  based on her relationship with Shepard.Â  Husband, who is an attorney, provided \r\n  Wife copies of a published opinion from this court that involved termination \r\n  of alimony based on the supported spouseâ€™s relationship with another party that \r\n  was tantamount to marriage.Â  According to Husband, Wife agreed at another meeting \r\n  in January of 1998 that Husband could terminate alimony after a two-year period.Â  \r\n  Wife testified similarly regarding the oral agreement, but the parties never \r\n  reduced any modification to writing.Â  \r\nThe family court ruled that circumstances \r\n  did not warrant termination of alimony because Wife was not involved in a relationship \r\n  with Shepard that was tantamount to marriage.Â  The family court found the oral \r\n  agreement regarding the termination of alimony was never reduced to writing \r\n  and was not approved by the court, and therefore was not enforceable.Â  The family \r\n  court further found Husbandâ€™s monthly income had dropped from $18,600 to $13,925 \r\n  while his monthly expenses had increased.Â  Citing this change, the family court \r\n  reduced Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation to $2,500 per month.Â  The family court \r\n  found neither party was entitled to an award of attorney fees.Â  Husband appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may \r\n  find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); \r\n  Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family \r\n  courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d \r\n  616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor do we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and \r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility \r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, \r\n  276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wifeâ€™s Relationship with Shepard\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in failing to \r\n  terminate alimony based on Wifeâ€™s relationship with Shepard because the relationship \r\n  is tantamount to marriage.Â  We disagree. \r\nChanged conditions may warrant a modification \r\n  or termination of alimony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  â€œThe purpose \r\n  of alimony is to provide the ex-spouse a substitute for the support which was \r\n  incident to the former marital relationship.â€Â  Croom v. Croom, 305 S.C. \r\n  158, 160, 406 S.E.2d 381, 382, (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Alimony â€œis not awarded to \r\n  support a live-in partnership between the supported ex-spouse and a third party.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Thus, â€œ[a] rule requiring alimony to continue in these circumstances \r\n  invidiously discriminates because it penalizes a divorced spouse for remarrying, \r\n  but rewards one for cohabitating without benefit of marriage.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Alimony may therefore be terminated when a supported ex-spouse is involved in \r\n  a relationship tantamount to marriage.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, \r\n  226, 553 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Living with another, whether it is \r\n  with a â€œlive-in-lover, a relative, or a platonic housemate,â€ changes the supported \r\n  ex-spouseâ€™s circumstances and alters the need for financial support.Â  Vance \r\n  v. Vance, 287 S.C. 615, 618, 340 S.E.2d 554, 555 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  \r\nAlthough Wifeâ€™s open \r\n  and notorious illicit relationship with Shepard may be viewed as immoral or \r\n  at least contrary to generally accepted social mores, the question this court \r\n  must answer does not concern morality but rather whether the relationship constituted \r\n  a change of circumstance under the law warranting termination of alimony.Â  We \r\n  find it did not.Â  In cases where our courts have found a change in circumstances \r\n  based on a relationship tantamount to marriage, the supported ex-spouse has \r\n  been involved in a relationship with another in which the parties have economically \r\n  relied upon one another.Â  See Bryson, 347 S.C. at 225, 553 S.C. \r\n  at 496 (finding relationship was tantamount to marriage and thus constituted \r\n  a substantial change in circumstance where supported ex-spouse and her live-in \r\n  companion resided in the same home for twelve years, and purchased a home together); \r\n  Vance, 287 S.C. at 617-18, 340 S.E.2d at 555 (finding relationship tantamount \r\n  to marriage where ex-spouse had taken up residence with her companion, the parties \r\n  had twice moved to accommodate one anotherâ€™s careers, and shared expenses).Â  \r\n\r\nHere, it is undisputed Wife and \r\n  Shepard maintain separate residences. Wife and Shepard maintain separate banking \r\n  and investment accounts.Â  With the exception of the travel fund, there is no \r\n  evidence Wife and Shepard have commingled any funds.Â  Furthermore, neither Wife \r\n  nor Shepard provides financial support to the other.Â  Under these circumstances, \r\n  we find the family court correctly ruled that Wifeâ€™s relationship with Shepard \r\n  was not tantamount to marriage. \r\nII.Â  Oral Modification\r\nAdditionally, Husband \r\n  argues the trial court erred in concluding the parties did not validly agree \r\n  to terminate Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation after December 1999.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe family court concluded the divorce decree and the partiesâ€™ \r\n  initial alimony agreement, which was incorporated in the decree, could not be \r\n  orally modified by the parties.Â  Husband contends the parties could orally modify \r\n  the agreement without a written agreement or the family courtâ€™s approval.Â  The \r\n  agreement reached between the parties and adopted by the family court in the \r\n  final divorce decree, however, specifically provided that the agreement and \r\n  any order approving the agreement â€œshall not be modified by the parties or any \r\n  court without written consent of husband and wife.â€Â  \r\nâ€œWhere an agreement is clear and capable of legal \r\n  construction, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and \r\n  the intention of the parties as found within the agreement and give effect to \r\n  it.â€Â  Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121, 125 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995).Â  â€œUnambiguous marital agreements will be enforced according to their \r\n  terms.â€Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 158, 543 S.E.2d 224, 230 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  Here, the agreement unambiguously provided the parties could not \r\n  modify the agreement without written consent of both parties.Â  However, Husband \r\n  cites Sanchez v. Tilley, 285 S.C. 449, 452, 330 S.E.2d 319, 320 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985), for the proposition that a written contract may be orally modified \r\n  despite a prohibition in the contract against oral modification.Â  \r\nIn Sanchez, a party sought to have an oral \r\n  agreement to reduce child support declared invalid because the partiesâ€™ original \r\n  written support agreement provided any modification had to be in writing.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Nothing in the Sanchez decision indicates the original support agreement \r\n  was approved and adopted by the family court.Â  By contrast, the Milesâ€™ original \r\n  support agreement was approved by the family court and made a part of the divorce \r\n  decree.Â  In essence, Husband is not just seeking to modify the partiesâ€™ written \r\n  agreement.Â  Rather, he is trying to modify a written court order by oral agreement \r\n  of the parties.Â  It is axiomatic that parties cannot modify a court order.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the family court properly rejected Husbandâ€™s reliance on Sanchez \r\n  and properly concluded that any oral agreement by the parties regarding the \r\n  termination of alimony was not enforceable.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Further Alimony \r\n  Reduction\r\nIn the alternative, \r\n  Husband argues the family court abused its discretion in failing to grant Husband \r\n  a greater reduction in his support obligation.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhenever [a spouse] . . . has \r\n  been required to make his or her spouse any periodic payments of alimony and \r\n  the circumstances of the parties or the financial ability of the spouse making \r\n  the periodic payments shall have changed since the rendition of such judgment, \r\n  either party may apply to the court which rendered the judgment for an order \r\n  and judgment decreasing or increasing the amount of such alimony payments or \r\n  terminating such payments . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  \r\n  To justify modification or termination of an alimony award, the changes in circumstances \r\n  must be substantial or material.Â  Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, \r\n  111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997).Â  Many of the same considerations relevant to \r\n  the initial setting of an alimony award may be applied in the modification context \r\n  as well, including the partiesâ€™ standard of living during the marriage, each \r\n  partyâ€™s earning capacity, and the supporting spouseâ€™s ability to continue to \r\n  support the other spouse.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d \r\n  727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nThe court carefully reviewed and contrasted the \r\n  income, expenses and assets of the parties at the time of the divorce in 1995 \r\n  and at the time of the hearing.Â  In 1995, Husband gross monthly income was $18,100, \r\n  with monthly expenses of $7,900.Â  In 1999 and 2000, Husbandâ€™s gross monthly \r\n  income was less than $14,000 and his monthly expenses had increased to $11,648.Â  \r\n  In the original agreement incorporated into the court order, it was contemplated \r\n  that Wife would be unemployed and therefore have no earned income.Â  She has \r\n  remained unemployed, but the court noted that the testimony of an expert revealed \r\n  that Wifeâ€™s estate was valued in 1995 at $594,746, but had increased to the \r\n  value of $648,624 at the time of the hearing.Â  The court noted Wife showed monthly \r\n  expenses of $4,310, but specifically found those expenses included $1,500 per \r\n  month payments on a bank loan for which there were no records to verify that \r\n  the payments were made on a monthly basis and that she had the financial resources \r\n  to fully satisfy that loan.Â  In light of Husbandâ€™s income and Wifeâ€™s monthly \r\n  expenses, we find no error in the family court declining to reduce Husbandâ€™s \r\n  alimony obligation by a greater amount.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  Fees\r\nLastly, Husband contends \r\n  the family court abused its discretion in failing to award him attorney fees \r\n  and costs.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe decision whether to award attorney \r\n  fees is a matter within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be \r\n  overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 \r\n  S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  In determining whether to award \r\n  attorney fees, the court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own \r\n  fees, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of \r\n  living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 \r\n  (1992).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the family court properly \r\n  considered the appropriate factors and concluded neither party was entitled \r\n  to recover attorney fees. Although Husband successfully received a reduction \r\n  in his alimony obligation, Husband was primarily seeking to terminate his alimony \r\n  obligation based on either Wifeâ€™s cohabitation with Shepard or the partiesâ€™ \r\n  oral agreement.Â  Husband was not successful on either of these claims.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Husbandâ€™s substantial income is sufficient to enable him to compensate his attorney.Â  \r\n  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s refusal to grant attorney fees to either \r\n  party.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nHOWARD, J., and STROM, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
