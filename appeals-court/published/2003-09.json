Lee Plumblee, Special Referee\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3674\r\n  Heard June 11, 2003 â€“ Filed September 15, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Jon E. Newlon and John R. McCravy, III, both of Greenwood, for Appellants.\r\n        James P. Walsh, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:Â  In this declaratory judgment \r\n  action, the special referee found Crystal Horne was not a Class I insured entitling \r\n  her to stack underinsured motorist benefits under Shirley Maxine Horneâ€™s automobile \r\n  insurance policy.Â  Crystal, Shirley Maxine, and Michael Horne appeal, arguing \r\n  the referee erred in finding: (1) Crystal was not a resident relative of Shirley \r\n  Maxine Horne and Michael Horneâ€™s household, and (2) Crystal was not herself \r\n  a named insured on the policy.Â Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCrystal Horneâ€™s parents divorced on July 22, 1988.Â  The final \r\n  divorce decree, entered in Saluda County, ordered that Crystalâ€™s mother, Dianne \r\n  Williams (Williams), â€œbe granted the permanent care, custody and control of \r\n  the partiesâ€™ minor childrenâ€ and that Michael Horne (Mr. Horne) â€œbe granted \r\n  the right to reasonable periods of visitation with the partiesâ€™ minor children.â€Â  \r\n  After the divorce, Crystalâ€™s mother remarried and remained living in Saluda \r\n  until moving to Conway in 1992.Â  Crystal, however, stayed with her father in \r\n  the Greenwood/Saluda area for approximately three months before moving to Horry \r\n  County to live with her mother and younger sister.Â  Before she moved to Horry \r\n  County, Crystal had lived with Williams in Saluda and had stayed with her father \r\n  during the summer months and every other weekend during the school year. \r\nOn March 9, 1997, Crystal sustained personal injuries from \r\n  an automobile wreck in Horry County while operating a 1987 Chevrolet Camaro.Â  \r\n  The Camaro was insured under an automobile policy issued by Auto-Owners Insurance \r\n  Company (Auto-Owners) to Shirley Maxine Horne (Mrs. Horne) as the named insured.Â  \r\n  Mrs. Horne is Michael Horneâ€™s wife and Crystalâ€™s stepmother.Â  Mr. Horne owned \r\n  the Camaro.Â  At the time of the accident, Crystal was seventeen years old and \r\n  her driverâ€™s license listed an address in Conway.Â  Crystal stated the address \r\n  on the driverâ€™s license is where she was living with her mother at the time \r\n  of the accident. [1]  \r\n From 1992 until the date of the accident, Crystal continued to live with Williams \r\n  in the Conway area and visited her father in Saluda during the summers, holidays, \r\n  and occasional weekends during the school year. Â Crystal would usually \r\n  spend the whole summer with her father in Saluda.Â  However, the summer prior \r\n  to the accident Crystal stayed in Saluda for only a few days during the summer.Â  \r\n  During Crystalâ€™s trips to Saluda, she would also visit and stay with her grandmothers \r\n  and aunts, who lived in the area.Â  \r\nFollowing the accident, Crystal recovered the limits against the liability \r\n  insurance carrier for the at-fault driver and then made a claim to Auto-Owners \r\n  for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits.Â  Auto-Owners paid Crystal the primary \r\n  UIM coverage on the vehicle involved in the wreck. \r\n  [2] Crystal then submitted a claim to Auto-Owners seeking to recover additional \r\n  UIM benefits by stacking coverages of other vehicles insured under Mrs. Horneâ€™s \r\n  policy.Â  \r\nAuto-Owners filed this declaratory judgment action \r\n  seeking to determine Crystalâ€™s eligibility for stacking UIM benefits under the \r\n  policy.Â  Pursuant to Rule 53(b), SCRCP, the parties consented to have the matter \r\n  heard by a special referee, with appeal from the refereeâ€™s final judgment to \r\n  be made directly to this Court.Â  The referee found Crystal was not entitled \r\n  to stack UIM benefits because she was not a named insured on the Auto-Owners \r\n  policy and did not reside in the named insuredâ€™s household at the time of the \r\n  accident.Â  The Hornes appeal. [3] \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, \r\n  but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland \r\n  County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  â€œAn issue essentially \r\n  one at law will not be transformed into one in equity simply because declaratory \r\n  relief is sought.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe issue here involves whether Crystal can stack underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage available under an insurance policy.Â  â€œAn action to determine \r\n  coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law.â€Â  South Carolina \r\n  Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 525, 528-29, 544 S.E.2d 848, \r\n  849 (Ct. App. 2001); see Richardson v. South Carolina Farm Bureau \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 233, 519 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating an \r\n  action seeking a declaration of whether coverage under uninsured motorist policies \r\n  could be stacked is an action at law); see also State Auto Prop. &amp; \r\n  Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gibbs, 314 S.C. 345, 444 S.E.2d 504 (1994) (stating an \r\n  action to declare excess insurance coverage is an action at law).Â  \r\n\r\n  In a non-jury action at law, the judgeâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed \r\n    on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  Rickborn v. Liberty \r\n    Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468 S.E.2d 292 (1996).Â  The trial courtâ€™s \r\n    findings of fact have the same force and effect as a jury verdict unless it \r\n    committed some error of law leading to an erroneous conclusion or unless the \r\n    evidence is reasonably susceptible of the opposite conclusion only.Â  Noisette \r\n    v. Ismail, 299 S.C. 243, 384 S.E.2d 310 (Ct. App. 1989), revâ€™d on other \r\n    grounds, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991).Â  We must affirm the trial \r\n    court if there is any evidence that reasonably supports its decision.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    In reviewing the findings, we must view the evidence and all its reasonable \r\n    inferences in the light least favorable to the losing party below.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nHiott v. Guar. Natâ€™l Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 522, \r\n  528-29, 496 S.E.2d 417, 421 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION  \r\n The Hornes argue the evidence established that Crystal resided with her father \r\n  for part of the year and the special referee thus erred in finding as a matter \r\n  of law that Crystal was not a resident relative of her fatherâ€™s household for \r\n  stacking purposes.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œStacking is the insuredâ€™s recovery of damages \r\n  under more than one policy until the insured satisfies all of his damages or \r\n  exhausts the limits of all available policies.â€Â  Contâ€™l Ins. Co. v. Shives, \r\n  328 S.C. 470, 473, 492 S.E.2d 808, 810 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œIn determining whether \r\n  an insured can stack, insureds are divided into two classes:Â  Class I and Class \r\n  II.Â  Only Class I insureds can stack.â€Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. \r\n  James, 337 S.C. 86, 94, 522 S.E.2d 345, 349 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Previous cases \r\n  have stated section 38-77-160 of the South Carolina Code of Laws [4]  is the statute controlling the right to stack \r\n  and that under this section â€œa Class I insured is an insured or named insured \r\n  who â€˜hasâ€™ a vehicle involved in the accident.â€Â  Concrete Servs., Inc. v. \r\n  United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 331 S.C. 506, 512, 498 S.E.2d 865, 868 \r\n  (1998).Â  In order â€œto â€˜haveâ€™ a vehicle involved in the accident as a prerequisite \r\n  to stacking mean[s] only that a person must be a Class I insured with respect \r\n  to a vehicle involved in the accident.â€Â  Id. at 513, 498 S.E.2d at 868.Â  \r\n  A Class I insured has been repeatedly defined as the named insured, his spouse \r\n  and relatives residing in his household.Â  Id.; see also Davidson \r\n  v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 245 S.C. 472, 477, 141 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1965) \r\n  (defining a Class I insured as the â€œnamed insured, his spouse and his or \r\n  her relatives resident in the same householdâ€) (emphasis added). [5] Â  A Class II insured includes any person using, with the consent \r\n  of the named insured, the motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest \r\n  in the motor vehicle.Â  Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 311 \r\n  S.E.2d 723 (1984).\r\nThe pertinent inquiry here is whether Crystal is a Class I insured.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the issue is whether Crystal was a resident relative of the named insuredâ€™s \r\n  household entitling her to stack UIM benefits under the policy.Â  \r\nOur Supreme Court first analyzed whether a person was a resident \r\n  relative of the same household as the named insured in Buddin v. Nationwide \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633 (1967).Â  In finding a nephew \r\n  was a â€œrelative resident of the same householdâ€ as his uncle, as that term was \r\n  used in the uncleâ€™s insurance policy to extend coverage to additional insureds, \r\n  the Court stated â€œâ€˜a resident of the same household is one, other than a temporary \r\n  or transient visitor, who lives together with others in the same house for a \r\n  period of some duration, although he may not intend to remain there permanently.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 339, 157 S.E.2d at 636 (quoting Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Home \r\n  Indem. Co., 50 Cal. Rptr. 508, 514 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1966)); see also \r\n  Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. v. Taylor, 528 N.E.2d 968, 969 (Ohio Ct. \r\n  App. 1987) (stating â€œthe word â€˜residentâ€™ as used in the phrase â€˜resident of \r\n  your household,â€™ [unless otherwise defined in a policy,] refers to one who lives \r\n  in the home of the named insured for a period of some duration or regularity, \r\n  although not necessarily there permanently, but excludes a temporary or transient \r\n  visitor.â€).Â  The Court also noted several factors for possible consideration \r\n  but stated that none of the factors were determinative of the issue.Â  Buddin, \r\n  250 S.C. at 338-39, 157 S.E.2d at 636.Â  The factors included:Â  (1) the payment \r\n  of rent or board; (2) the presence or absence of control over the relative; \r\n  and (3) whether there was lack of a permanent living arrangement.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThis Court has more recently considered whether \r\n  an individual was a resident relative in Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, \r\n  330 S.C. 578, 500 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 1998), and Richardson v. South Carolina \r\n  Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 233, 519 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  In Langford, we recognized the notion of the individualâ€™s intent and \r\n  noted â€œa person may be a resident relative for insurance purposes even though \r\n  he does not have an intent to permanently reside with the insured.â€Â  Langford, \r\n  330 S.C. at 583, 500 S.E.2d at 498.Â Â  \r\nIn Richardson, we affirmed the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  determination that a twenty-five-year-old graduate student was not a resident \r\n  relative of her fatherâ€™s household, and thus, was not entitled to stack uninsured \r\n  motorist coverage under her fatherâ€™s policy.Â  The daughter was held to be a \r\n  â€œtransitory visitor,â€ even though she still had certain connections to her fatherâ€™s \r\n  household.Â  Richardson, 336 S.C. at 236-37, 519 S.E.2d at 122.Â  In so \r\n  holding, we noted several factors supporting the trial courtâ€™s finding that \r\n  the daughter was not a resident of her fatherâ€™s household, including:Â  (1) she \r\n  kept an exercise machine, some furniture, and seasonal clothes at her fatherâ€™s \r\n  house; (2) she acknowledged living in various apartments in the seven years \r\n  preceding the accident; (3) she usually visited her parents once a month for \r\n  three to four days at a time; (4) she spent only a portion of two summers with \r\n  her parents in the four years prior to the accident; (5) she filed her own tax \r\n  returns and claimed herself as a dependent; (6) her tax refund was not sent \r\n  to her fatherâ€™s house; (7) her driverâ€™s license did not list her fatherâ€™s address; \r\n  (8) she was registered to vote in a different county than her father; and (9) \r\n  Richardson worked regularly and claimed income of over $10,000 in each of the \r\n  two years prior to the accident.Â  Id. at 237, 519 S.E.2d at 122-123.\r\nIn State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Breazell, our Supreme Court also \r\n  discussed, in the context of a homeownerâ€™s policy, whether a foster child was \r\n  a resident of the foster parentsâ€™ household and adopted a three-factor test \r\n  for making this determination.Â  State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Breazell, \r\n  324 S.C. 228, 478 S.E.2d 831 (1996).\r\n\r\n  The determination under the . . . test is dependent upon [these] factors:Â  \r\n    (1) living under the same roof; (2) in a close, intimate and informal relationship \r\n    between the parties; and (3) where the intended duration of the relationship \r\n    is likely to be substantial, where it is consistent with the informality of \r\n    the relationship, and from which it is reasonable to conclude that the parties \r\n    would consider the relationship in contracting about such matters as insurance \r\n    or in their conduct in reliance thereon.\r\n\r\nId. at 231, 478 S.E.2d at 832.\r\nNotwithstanding the South Carolina appellate courtsâ€™ determinations \r\n  of resident relative status in the above cases, our courts have not considered \r\n  the issue of whether a child is a resident relative of a noncustodial parentâ€™s \r\n  household when the childâ€™s parents are divorced or separated, the child is living \r\n  with one parent, and custody of the child has been established.Â  Numerous other \r\n  states have visited this issue with varying results.Â  See generally Carolyn \r\n  Kelly MacWilliam, Annotation, Who is â€œMemberâ€ or â€œResidentâ€ of Same â€œFamilyâ€ \r\n  or â€œHouseholdâ€ within No-Fault or Uninsured Motorist Provisions of Motor Vehicle \r\n  Insurance Policy, 66 A.L.R.5th 269 (1999).Â  \r\nThe analysis in cases of this type is generally fact-specific \r\n  and no bright line test exists for determining under what instances a child \r\n  is a resident relative of a noncustodial parent.Â  See Griffith v. \r\n  Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 356 A.2d 94, 97 (Conn. 1975) (stating the problem \r\n  of deciding whether a person is a member of a particular household is dependent \r\n  upon the factual circumstances involved and noting the factual circumstances \r\n  in the cases are so varied that the decisions are of little precedential value); \r\n  Adams v. Great Am. Ins. Cos., 942 P.2d 1087, 1091 (Wash. Ct. App. 1997) \r\n  (stating there is no bright line test for determining residency in a household \r\n  and the inquiry in each case is factual).Â  The fact-specific analysis in the \r\n  various cases can be attributed to the phrase â€œresident of the same householdâ€ \r\n  having no absolute or precise meaning.Â  See Buddin, 250 S.C. at \r\n  338, 157 S.E.2d at 635; Coriasco v. Hutchcraft, 615 N.E.2d 64, 65 (Ill. \r\n  App. Ct. 1993) (stating the phrase â€œresident of the householdâ€ has no fixed \r\n  or exact meaning); Pierce v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 627 P.2d 152, \r\n  154 (Wash. Ct. App. 1981) (â€œThe phrase â€˜residents of the same householdâ€™ has \r\n  no fixed meaning but varies according to the circumstances of the case.â€).Â  \r\n  The decisions of other courts on this issue have resulted from the application \r\n  of the facts in the cases before them to a variety of factors. [6] \r\nIn Countryside Cas. Co. v. McCormick, 722 \r\n  S.W.2d 655 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987), the court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision in a declaratory judgment action that a child was a resident of her \r\n  fatherâ€™s household, even though her mother had been granted custody.Â  The appellate \r\n  court found that an aggregate of the following factors tended to support the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding:Â  (1) the childâ€™s age; (2) the proximity of the divorced \r\n  parents; (3) whether reasonable visitation rights had been awarded under the \r\n  divorce decree; (4) currency of child support payments; (5) the relationship \r\n  between the parent and the child; (6) whether the child had a separate bedroom \r\n  and wardrobe; and (7) the frequency of visitation.Â  Id. at 658.Â  The \r\n  court also noted that the most significant factor in determining residence is \r\n  custody, but that other factors affect the determination, including periods \r\n  of residence with the parent and substantial support from the parent.Â  Id. \r\n  at 657; accord Garrison v. Travelers Ins. Co., 618 A.2d 387 (N.J. \r\n  Super. Ct. Law Div. 1992) (recognizing and applying the factors discussed in \r\n  Countryside to find that a nine-year-old was a resident relative of her \r\n  non-custodial fatherâ€™s household; the child visited her father every other weekend \r\n  and for extended periods over school holidays in the five months prior to the \r\n  child being struck by an underinsured automobile).Â Â  \r\nAn Illinois court held that the determination of \r\n  residency in each case includes an analysis of intent, physical presence, and \r\n  permanency of abode.Â  Coriasco, 615 N.E.2d at 65; see Country \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co. v. Watson, 274 N.E.2d 136, 138 (Ill. App. Ct. 1971) (â€œThe \r\n  elements required beyond physical presence are intention and permanency of abode.â€).Â  \r\n  The court applied the facts of the case to these factors and found a minor child \r\n  to be a resident of her fatherâ€™s household.Â  The childâ€™s parents had divorced \r\n  and custody had been awarded to the mother.Â  The child â€œresided with her mother \r\n  except for visitation with her father which occurs principally on weekends and \r\n  occasionally during the week.â€Â  Coriasco, 615 N.E.2d at 66.Â  The child \r\n  also kept clothing and personal items at her fatherâ€™s house and had occasionally \r\n  received mail there. \r\nIn another case, a seventeen-year-old son was found not to be a resident relative \r\n  of his fatherâ€™s household.Â  Gulf Am. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Azar, 364 \r\n  So. 2d 332 (Ala. Civ. App. 1978).Â  At the time of an accident involving an uninsured \r\n  motorist, the son had been living with his mother for three months pursuant \r\n  to the custody arrangements of a divorce decree.Â  The son had visited at his \r\n  fatherâ€™s home but had not spent the night there.Â  â€œAs these facts indicate, \r\n  neither [the sonâ€™s] actual or legal residence was in his fatherâ€™s household.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 334.Â  \r\nIn a North Carolina declaratory judgment action \r\n  to determine a minor childâ€™s entitlement to uninsured motorist coverage under \r\n  her fatherâ€™s insurance policy, the court held â€œthe evidence discloses that there \r\n  existed between the father and the minor plaintiff a continuing and substantially \r\n  integrated family relationship.â€Â  Davis v. Maryland Cas. Co., 331 S.E.2d \r\n  744, 747 (N.C. Ct. App. 1985).Â  The court pointed to the childâ€™s frequent overnight \r\n  stays with her father, the provisions made for the keeping of the childâ€™s clothes, \r\n  personal property, and furniture, and the fatherâ€™s support and healthcare obligations \r\n  pursuant to a separation agreement.Â  Id. at 745.Â  In addition, the court \r\n  noted that for insurance purposes a child is not a resident of one parentâ€™s \r\n  household to the exclusion of the other, but could be a resident of both households.Â  \r\n  Id. at 746; see also Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Phillips, \r\n  575 S.W.2d 62 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978) (affirming juryâ€™s finding that a fourteen-year-old \r\n  living with his father was still a resident relative of his motherâ€™s household \r\n  and pointing out that a finding of residency in one household does not necessarily \r\n  foreclose that person being a resident of another household).Â  \r\nThe Washington Court of Appeals listed four factors \r\n  to consider in addressing whether a child is a resident of a household:Â  â€œ(1) \r\n  the intent of the departing person, (2) the formality or informality of the \r\n  relationship between the person and the members of the household, (3) the relative \r\n  propinquity of the dwelling units, and (4) the existence of another place of \r\n  lodging.â€Â  Adams v. Great Am. Ins. Cos., 942 P.2d 1087, 1090 (Wash. Ct. \r\n  App. 1997) (quoting Pierce v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 627 P.2d 152, \r\n  155 (Wash. Ct. App. 1981)).Â  Interestingly, the court then went on to frame \r\n  the question as follows for cases of this type:Â  \r\n\r\n  Does the child regularly spend time in the household in question, such that \r\n    there exists a continuing expectation of the childâ€™s periodic return on intervals \r\n    regular enough that the household is the childâ€™s home during the time the \r\n    child is there, as opposed to a place of infrequent and irregular visits.\r\n\r\nAdams, 942 P.2d at 1091.\r\nIn Midwest Mut. Ins. Co. v. Titus, a Colorado court focused on intent \r\n  and stated a â€œ[c]onsideration of all relevant circumstances must reveal â€˜some \r\n  intended presence in the insuredâ€™s home.â€™â€Â  Midwest Mut. Ins. Co. v. Titus, \r\n  849 P.2d 908, 910 (Colo. Ct. App. 1993) (quoting Wheeler v. Allstate Ins. \r\n  Co., 814 P.2d 9, 10 (Colo. Ct. App. 1991)).Â  The court listed the factors \r\n  it would take into account in determining whether an individual is a resident \r\n  of a household to include the â€œsubjective or declared intent of the individual, \r\n  the relation between the individual and the members of the household, the existence \r\n  of a second place of lodging, and the relative permanence or transient nature \r\n  of the individualâ€™s residence in the household.â€Â  Midwest, 849 P.2d at \r\n  910.Â  The childâ€™s status as a minor is just one factor to be considered.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The court also recognized that a child of divorced parents is a resident of \r\n  the household in which she actually lives but the child may reside in more than \r\n  one household.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn another case focusing on intent, the Rhode Island Supreme Court stated the \r\n  test for residency as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  In order to determine if a person is a resident of a particular household, \r\n    the court must consider whether in the totality of the circumstances that \r\n    person maintains a physical presence in the household with the intent to remain \r\n    there for more than a mere transitory period, or that person has a reasonably \r\n    recent history of physical presence together with circumstances that manifest \r\n    an intent to return to the residence within a reasonably foreseeable period.\r\n\r\nBarricelli v. Am. Universal Ins. Co., 583 \r\n  A.2d 1270, 1271 (R.I. 1990) (quoting Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Carrera, \r\n  577 A.2d 980, 985 (R.I. 1990)).Â  In Barricelli, custody of a minor daughter \r\n  had been granted to her mother.Â  The daughter lived with her mother for four \r\n  years and then permanently moved in with her father.Â  The custody decree was \r\n  not judicially modified.Â  The daughter received her own room in her fatherâ€™s \r\n  home, registered for and attended school from the fatherâ€™s home, received mail \r\n  there, and kept most of her personal belongings and clothing there.Â  The father \r\n  claimed the daughter as a dependent on his tax returns.Â  The daughter â€œmaintained \r\n  a structured, albeit intermittent, relationshipâ€ with her mother â€œalthough it \r\n  remained necessary for [the daughter] to pack a suitcase to stay with her mother \r\n  on the alternate weekends.â€Â  Id. at 1271.Â  The court held the totality \r\n  of the circumstances showed the impermanence of the daughterâ€™s physical presence \r\n  in her motherâ€™s household and failed to establish the daughterâ€™s visits to her \r\n  motherâ€™s home were for anything more than a transitory period.Â  Id. at \r\n  1272.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Herbst v. Hansen, 176 N.W.2d 380, 384 (Wis. 1970), the court stated \r\n  the test for whether a person remains a member of a household is whether the \r\n  person has intent to return.Â  In this case, the mother had been granted custody \r\n  of a ten-year-old child pursuant to a decree of legal separation.Â  The issue \r\n  was whether the child could be considered a resident of the same household as \r\n  his father under the fatherâ€™s insurance policy.Â  The court found the fatherâ€™s \r\n  continued support and visitation, coupled with the parentsâ€™ chances for reconciliation, \r\n  precluded granting summary judgment in favor of the fatherâ€™s insurance carrier \r\n  given the facts supported a finding that the fatherâ€™s absence was only temporary.Â  \r\n  The court held if a party is not living under the â€œfamily roofâ€ at the time \r\n  in question then the absence of that party must be of a temporary nature with \r\n  intent to return.Â  Id.Â  â€œâ€˜Whether the absence from the household is of \r\n  long or short duration is immaterial except as it may give rise to an inference \r\n  of intent to remain away permanently or only temporarily.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting \r\n  Doern v. Crawford, 140 N.W.2d 193, 196 (Wis. 1966)); see also \r\n  Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Wittkopp, 741 A.2d 619, 622 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. \r\n  Div. 1999) (â€œAbsence from a parentâ€™s home, even for several months, does not \r\n  terminate the childâ€™s residency without additional factors.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Elder v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., \r\n  851 S.W.2d 557 (Mo. Ct. App. 1993), a twenty-year-old son was held not to reside \r\n  with his father for insurance purposes.Â  The son contended he was an unemancipated \r\n  minor and should be considered a resident of his fatherâ€™s household even though \r\n  he lived with his mother on a permanent basis and his parents were separated \r\n  and living apart.Â  The court found the evidence suggested the son was not truly \r\n  unemancipated since he was not attending secondary school or an institution \r\n  of vocational or higher education.Â  Id. at 561.Â  Custody had been placed \r\n  with the mother and the son had not stayed with his father in the two and a \r\n  half years preceding the accident.Â  The court stated custody was the most important \r\n  factor in determining residency.Â  Id. at 560.Â  The court also stated \r\n  â€œ[r]esidence is a matter of intention and depends on a personâ€™s physical location.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 561; cf. Amica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Donegal Mut. Ins. Co., \r\n  545 A.2d 343 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) (holding residence in a household under the \r\n  policy in question was a matter of physical fact and not intention). \r\nAs evident from these cases, there is no single \r\n  test to determine whether a minor child is a resident of a noncustodial parentâ€™s \r\n  household for purposes of determining UIM benefits.Â  Rather, the courts generally \r\n  look at the facts and circumstances of each case in totality to determine the \r\n  childâ€™s residency.Â  In this case, the record supports the refereeâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that Crystal was not a resident relative of the Horneâ€™s household.\r\nIn support of their contention that Crystal was \r\n  a resident relative, the Hornes cite the following evidence: (1) Crystalâ€™s visits \r\n  were planned, coordinated, and expected; (2) Crystal received mail at her fatherâ€™s \r\n  address; (3) Crystalâ€™s custodial setting was established pursuant to the 1988 \r\n  divorce decree; (4) the Hornes maintained a room prepared with furniture, lamps, \r\n  and a trash can they purchased and designated for Crystalâ€™s use when she was \r\n  with them; (5) Crystal kept clothes, toiletries, and other items at the Hornesâ€™ \r\n  house; (6) Crystal ate meals with and prepared by Mr. Horne; (7) Crystal washed \r\n  clothes at the Hornesâ€™ house; (8) Crystal had unrestricted access to the entire \r\n  house while she lived there and was not required to obtain permission before \r\n  returning to the house; and (9) Mr. Horne maintained health insurance for Crystal \r\n  and was current on child support payments. Â The Hornes argue this evidence, \r\n  especially the planned and coordinated nature of Crystalâ€™s visits, demonstrates \r\n  residency and show Crystal â€œhad every intent to continue the relationship with \r\n  her father without ever considering ending it.â€ The special referee noted the \r\n  evidence established Crystal had a close relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Horne \r\n  but it did not translate into a finding that Crystal was a resident of their \r\n  household.Â  See Griffith v. Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 356 A.2d \r\n  94, 96 (Conn. 1975) (stating evidence indicating a close paternal relationship \r\n  does not necessarily support an additional finding that the parties are members \r\n  of the same household).\r\nCrystalâ€™s parents divorced in 1988 and sole custody \r\n  had been granted to Williams.Â  Crystal moved with Williams to Conway in 1992 \r\n  and they have resided there since that time.Â  Mr. and Mrs. Horne have remained \r\n  in the Saluda/Greenwood area.Â  In the year prior to the accident Crystal had \r\n  stayed with her father on a maximum of three occasions, for a total of approximately \r\n  fourteen days, but at the time of the accident Crystal had not visited her father \r\n  for over three months. [7] Â  Crystal, however, could not \r\n  testify with any certainty whether she had visited her father during the 1996 \r\n  Thanksgiving holiday. \r\nCrystal did not maintain everyday clothes or other \r\n  possessions at her fatherâ€™s house.Â  If any items had been left behind or forgotten \r\n  at her fatherâ€™s house, such as clothes or cosmetics, it was because Crystal \r\n  did not need the items or did not use them anymore.Â  Any mail Crystal may have \r\n  received at her fatherâ€™s house came only from her mother.Â  Crystalâ€™s healthcare \r\n  providers were located in Conway and Crystalâ€™s driverâ€™s license listed her address \r\n  as her motherâ€™s home.Â  Williams claimed Crystal as a dependent on her tax return. \r\n\r\nCrystal was seventeen years old at the time of \r\n  the accident and worked full-time at a Burger King restaurant close to her home \r\n  in Conway.Â  She was scheduled to work on the day after the accident.Â  Crystal \r\n  began spending significantly less time with her father once she quit school \r\n  in 1996 after her ninth-grade year and began working at Burger King.Â  Crystal \r\n  spent only a few days in Saluda during the summer of 1996 and did not spend \r\n  the entire summer as she had in previous years.Â  Mr. and Mrs. Horne admitted \r\n  Crystalâ€™s visits became less frequent through the years.Â  When Crystal started \r\n  working, the pattern of visitation changed, and she did not visit unless she \r\n  had time off from work.Â  However, Crystal had time off from her job at Burger \r\n  King the weekend before the accident but she did not leave the Conway/Myrtle \r\n  Beach area. \r\nCrystal packed a suitcase when she traveled to \r\n  Saluda and spent the night with other family members besides her father during \r\n  her visits. Sometimes Crystal would visit her other relatives before going to \r\n  her fatherâ€™s house.Â  During her four- or five-day stay in Saluda over the Christmas \r\n  holiday before the accident, Crystal spent nights with her two aunts and her \r\n  grandmother.Â  Crystal shared a room at her fatherâ€™s house with her sister.Â  \r\n  Moreover, Crystalâ€™s stepsister also used the bedroom when she would visit her \r\n  mother, Mrs. Horne.Â  The stepsister did not have to ask Crystal for permission \r\n  to use the bedroom. Â Crystal had unrestricted access to her fatherâ€™s house when \r\n  she was there but her father required her to call before she visited so he would \r\n  know she was coming and Crystal never just â€œshowed up.â€ \r\nThe special referee properly found Crystal was \r\n  not a resident relative of her fatherâ€™s household.Â  The evidence in the record \r\n  reasonably supports his decision and is not â€œreasonably susceptible of the opposite \r\n  conclusion only.â€Â  Hiott, 329 S.C. at 529, 496 S.E.2d at 421.Â  We agree \r\n  with the referee that while Crystal had a close relationship with her father \r\n  and stepmother, she was not a resident of their household.Â  Crystalâ€™s short, \r\n  infrequent visits to Saluda, scattered with her overnight stays with other relatives, \r\n  demonstrate the transient nature of Crystalâ€™s residence in her fatherâ€™s household.Â  \r\n  Buddin, 250 S.C. at 339, 157 S.E.2d at 636; Midwest, 849 P.2d \r\n  at 910.Â  Crystal could visit Saluda only when she was able to get off of work.Â Â Â  \r\n  Her work schedule at the time of the accident precluded an expectation of Crystalâ€™s \r\n  return to the home with any regularity.Â  Any personal items left at her fatherâ€™s \r\n  home do not indicate an intent to return there with any regularity given the \r\n  items were either forgotten or were not needed any longer.Â  In some respects, \r\n  Crystal had even less contacts with her fatherâ€™s household than did the daughter \r\n  in Richardson, 336 S.C. at 237, 519 S.E.2d at 122-23 (finding the daughter \r\n  was not a resident of her fatherâ€™s household even though she kept furniture \r\n  and an exercise bike at her fatherâ€™s home and usually visited her parents once \r\n  a month for three or four days at a time).Â  The circumstances present in this \r\n  case do not manifest Crystalâ€™s intent to return to her fatherâ€™s household within \r\n  a reasonably foreseeable period or her intent to remain there for more than \r\n  a transitory period.Â  Barricelli, 583 A.2d at 1271.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, because Crystal was not a resident relative of the named insuredâ€™s \r\n  household, she was not a Class I insured entitled to stack UIM benefits.Â  See \r\n  Concrete Servs., 331 S.C. at 509, 498 S.E.2d at 866 (â€œThe right to stack \r\n  is available only to a Class I insured.â€).Â  The special refereeâ€™s judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED. [8] \r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  Crystal was apparently confused during her deposition about her \r\n    stated address and the address listed on her driverâ€™s license.Â  Crystal stated \r\n    she lived at 4134 Highland Drive, Aynor, at the time of the accident and that \r\n    this was the address found on her driverâ€™s license.Â  Crystal had earlier testified \r\n    she and her mother â€œmoved to 4134 in Aynorâ€ after living at an address in \r\n    Conway. However, the copy of Crystalâ€™s driverâ€™s license included in the record \r\n    lists her address as Plum Tree Lane, Conway.Â  Any discrepancy between Crystalâ€™s \r\n    stated address and that found on her driverâ€™s license does not affect our \r\n    analysis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  The underinsured motorist endorsement of the policy issued to Mrs. \r\n    Horne stated Auto-Owners â€œwill pay damages for:Â  (1) Bodily injury sustained \r\n    by any person occupying or getting in or out of an automobile . . . covered \r\n    by the Liability Coverage of the Policy, provided such person is legally entitled \r\n    to recover such damages from the owner or driver of an [under]insured motor \r\n    vehicle.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  In their brief, the Hornes argued the referee erred in finding Crystal \r\n    was not also a named insured under the Auto-Owners policy.Â  However, at oral \r\n    argument the Hornes abandoned this argument.Â  Thus, we will not address it.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  Section 38-77-160 provides \r\n    in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If, however, an insured or named insured is protected by uninsured \r\n    or underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the basic limits, the policy \r\n    shall provide that the insured or named insured is protected only to the extent \r\n    of the coverage he has on the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  If none of \r\n    the insuredâ€™s or named insuredâ€™s vehicles is involved in the accident, coverage \r\n    is available only to the extent of coverage on any one of the vehicles with \r\n    the excess or underinsured coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Even though Davidson defined two classes of insured \r\n    persons, the decision did not involve an issue of stacking.Â  In Davidson, \r\n    the two classes of insureds were culled from the definition of the term â€œinsuredâ€ \r\n    under section 46-750.11 of the 1962 South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  Davidson, \r\n    245 S.C. at 476-77, 141 S.E.2d at 137-38.Â  This section defined â€œinsuredâ€ \r\n    as the â€œnamed insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse \r\n    of any such named insured and relatives of either . . . , and any person \r\n    who uses, with the consent . . . of the named insured, the motor vehicle to \r\n    which the policy applies and a guest in such a motor vehicle . . . .â€Â  S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 46-750.11 (1962) (emphasis added).Â  The current definition of \r\n    insured found in section 38-77-30 is nearly identical to the former definition \r\n    under which the Davidson court formed the separate classes of insureds. \r\n    Â However, it appears that later stacking cases have pared down the language \r\n    of a Class I insured to include only the named insured, his spouse, and relatives \r\n    residing in his household, rather than relatives of either the named \r\n    insured or the spouse of the named insured.Â  See, e.g., Concrete \r\n    Servs., Inc., 331 S.C. at 514, 498 S.E.2d at 868-69 (stating that to qualify \r\n    as a Class I insured an individual must be the spouse or relative of the named \r\n    insured); Garris v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 149, 156, 311 S.E.2d \r\n    723, 727 (1984) (defining the first class of insureds to include the named \r\n    insured, his spouse and relatives residing in his household); Richardson \r\n    v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 233, 235, 519 S.E.2d \r\n    120, 122 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œA Class I insured is a named insured, his spouse, \r\n    and relatives residing in his household.â€).Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A literal and \r\n    exacting application of the definition of a Class I insured in the stacking \r\n    cases after Davidson raises an interesting issue in the present case.Â  \r\n    Obviously, the question of whether someone is a resident relative requires \r\n    that residency and relationship be shown.Â  Since Crystal is not a spouse of \r\n    Mrs. Horne, the named insured, in order for Crystal to stack UIM benefits \r\n    she must be Mrs. Horneâ€™s relative.Â  However, Crystal may not be Mrs. Horneâ€™s \r\n    relative.Â  Ordinarily, a relative is defined as a person connected by blood, \r\n    marriage, or adoption.Â  Inman v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 300 S.C. \r\n    550, 551-52, 389 S.E.2d 173, 174 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  But â€œ[i]n the context of \r\n    insurance contracts, â€˜relativeâ€™ has been reasonably interpreted as restricted \r\n    to those related by consanguinity and excluding those related by affinity.â€Â  \r\n    Forner v. Butler, 319 S.C. 275, 278, 460 S.E.2d 425, 427 (Ct. App. \r\n    1995).Â  \r\n  However, even though Crystal \r\n    may not be Mrs. Horneâ€™s relative based on Forner, Auto-Owners did not \r\n    raise this issue in its complaint.Â  In its brief, Auto-Owners states the â€œSpecial \r\n    Referee correctly held that Crystal Horne was not living with her father and \r\n    the named insured (stepmother) at the time of the . . . accident.â€Â  Thus, \r\n    because Crystal is certainly Mr. Horneâ€™s relative, and thereby is entitled \r\n    to stack if she is a resident, we will address whether Crystal is a resident \r\n    of her fatherâ€™s, and Mrs. Horneâ€™s, household for stacking purposes.Â  Moreover, \r\n    in this case, the household of one (Mr. Horne) is the household of the other \r\n    (Mrs. Horne).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  The insurance policies discussed in most of the following cases in \r\n    the remainder of this opinion usually provide coverage for a named insured \r\n    and his or her relatives or family members.Â  The broad issue in each case \r\n    centers on whether a child is an insured under a parentâ€™s insurance policy.Â  \r\n    The terms â€œrelativesâ€ and â€œfamily membersâ€ are consistently defined in the \r\n    insurance policies as â€œa resident of the same householdâ€ as the named insured.Â  \r\n    The present case is distinguishable because the policy issued to Mrs. Horne \r\n    does not define a â€œrelativeâ€ or a â€œfamily member.â€Â  However, this is of no \r\n    consequence because we are not concerned with the definition of either term \r\n    under an insurance policy.Â  Our inquiry focuses on whether Crystal is a resident \r\n    of the Horneâ€™s household based on statutory and common law concepts of stacking.Â  \r\n    The following cases are nonetheless instructive given the policy language \r\n    in the cases is so similar to our notion of a Class I insured as being a resident \r\n    relative of the same household as the named insured.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7] Â  The three occasions in 1996 included a few days in the summertime, \r\n    Thanksgiving, and Christmas.Â  The Hornes dispute the refereeâ€™s finding of \r\n    fourteen days, arguing Crystal spent a weekend with her father approximately \r\n    one month before the accident.Â  However, the Hornes point to an isolated portion \r\n    of Crystalâ€™s stepbrotherâ€™s testimony for this proposition.Â  In context, her \r\n    stepbrotherâ€™s testimony refers to Crystalâ€™s visits on the weekends before \r\n    Crystal moved to Conway in 1992.Â  Even assuming sixteen days were correct, \r\n    the two-day difference would not affect our analysis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8] Â  The Hornes also urge this Court to hold that a minor unemancipated \r\n    child can be a resident of two households.Â  See, e.g., Davis v. \r\n    Maryland Cas. Co., 331 S.E.2d 744, 746-47 (N.C. Ct. App. 1985) (stating \r\n    it is not required that a minor be a resident of one parentâ€™s household to \r\n    the exclusion of the other and that a minor could be a resident of two separate \r\n    households).Â  We need not specifically rule on this issue given the facts \r\n    in this case do not demonstrate Crystal resided in her fatherâ€™s household.Â  \r\n    However, implicit in this decision is the recognition that a child of divorced \r\n    parents may be a resident of two households given Crystal is surely a resident \r\n    of her motherâ€™s household.Â  Cf. Cook v. Fed. Ins. Co., 263 S.C. \r\n    575, 582, 211 S.E.2d 881, 884 (1975) (â€œA person may have only one domicile, \r\n    but may have several residences.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3675","title":"State v.

Coombs, \r\n  Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this opinion we must decide \r\n  whether the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to convict Jimmy Lee \r\n  Ellison of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor.Â  We hold \r\n  the indictment as originally drafted and as amended failed to confer such jurisdiction \r\n  and vacate Ellisonâ€™s conviction.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nEllison was indicted following an allegation \r\n  that he raped a 13 year old girl.Â  Both the caption of the indictment and the \r\n  title preceding the text in the body of the indictment stated that the offense \r\n  was â€œCriminal sexual conduct with a minor (first degree).â€Â  The language in \r\n  the body of the indictment alleged Ellison â€œdid commit, or attempt to commit, \r\n  a sexual battery in and upon [Victim], age thirteen . . . by using aggravated \r\n  force and aggravated coercion upon her and assaulting her with the intent to \r\n  commit sexual battery with the said [Victim].â€Â  The indictment further stated \r\n  Ellisonâ€™s conduct was a violation of section 16-3-655 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code, the statute prohibiting CSC with minors.Â  \r\nAt the onset of trial, the State moved to amend the \r\n  statutory reference, asserting it intended to charge Ellison with first-degree \r\n  CSC and that the statute referenced was merely an error.Â  When the court inquired, \r\n  defense counsel stated he was aware the State intended to charge first-degree \r\n  CSC and that the amendment would make no difference in the presentation of his \r\n  defense.Â  The court then permitted the amendment without objection.Â  \r\nWhile conferencing proposed jury instructions after the close \r\n  of the evidence, the State requested the court submit second-degree CSC as a \r\n  lesser-included offense of first-degree CSC.Â  The State reasoned that the jury \r\n  might believe the victim but not be convinced the circumstances rose to the \r\n  level of aggravated force.Â  The court questioned the Stateâ€™s decision not to \r\n  charge second-degree CSC with a minor, which would have made proof of force \r\n  or coercion unnecessary. Â Concern was also expressed that the jury might \r\n  acquit Ellison if they thought Victim â€œconsentedâ€ to the encounter.Â  Defense \r\n  counsel noted he intended to argue the alleged event did not occur at all, not \r\n  that it was consensual.Â  The defense thus objected to the submission of any \r\n  charge other than first-degree CSC, and the State elected to proceed on that \r\n  charge alone.Â  \r\nDuring Ellisonâ€™s closing argument, the State objected to \r\n  a comment on the ground that it invited the jury to disregard evidence. Â After \r\n  closing arguments, the court, on its own initiative, concluded the defense \r\n  had introduced the issue of Victimâ€™s consent in its closing argument and decided, \r\n  over defense objection, to charge second-degree CSC with a minor as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of first-degree CSC. Â The jury found Ellison guilty of second-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nEllison argues the trial court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to convict him of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a \r\n  minor because it is not a lesser-included offense of the charge for which he \r\n  was indicted.Â  We agree, and further hold that the indictment fails independently \r\n  to vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction on the charge for which Ellison \r\n  was convicted.Â  \r\nâ€œA criminal defendant is entitled to be tried only \r\n  on indicted offenses.â€Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 248, 251, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  396, 397 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In South Carolina, â€œit is a rule of universal observance \r\n  in administering the criminal law that a defendant must be convicted, if convicted \r\n  at all, of the particular offense charged in the bill of indictment.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Cody, 180 S.C. 417, 423, 186 S.E. 165, 167 (1936).Â  â€œAn indictment is \r\n  sufficient if it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended \r\n  to be charged and apprises the defendant what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Wilkes, 353 S.C. 462, 465, 578 S.E.2d 717, 718 (2003).Â  â€œFurther, \r\n  an indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty \r\n  and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and \r\n  the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead \r\n  an acquittal or conviction thereon.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe body of the indictment here alleged Ellison committed \r\n  a sexual battery on a 13 year old.Â  A person who commits a sexual battery on \r\n  a person â€œwho is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years \r\n  of ageâ€ is guilty of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(2) \r\n  (2003).Â  However, the caption of the indictment and the title to the indictmentâ€™s \r\n  body stated the alleged crime was first-degree CSC with a minor, a crime involving \r\n  prohibited sexual conduct with a person under the age of 11.Â  Â§ 16-3-655(1).Â  \r\n\r\nThe indictment is even more complicated because the body \r\n  also contains factual allegations apparently sufficient to charge both first-degree \r\n  CSC by alleging Ellison used aggravated force and second-degree CSC by alleging \r\n  Ellison used aggravated coercion.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652(1)(a) (2003) (a \r\n  person who commits a sexual battery by use of aggravated force is guilty of \r\n  first-degree CSC); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-653(1) (2003) (a person who commits \r\n  a sexual battery by use of aggravated coercion is guilty of second-degree CSC).Â  \r\n  The body of the indictment does not specifically state the name of the offense \r\n  Ellison allegedly committed.Â  Further confusing the issue, the indictment was \r\n  amended at the beginning of trial to change the statutory reference from the \r\n  general statute prohibiting CSC with minors to the statute prohibiting first-degree \r\n  CSC.Â  \r\nOur supreme court recently reviewed the sufficiency of an \r\n  indictment with similar difficulties.Â  In Cohen v. State, 354 S.C. 563, \r\n  582 S.E.2d 403 (2003), the indictment alleged Willie Cohen engaged in CSC with \r\n  a minor.Â  The body of the indictment as well as its title and the indictmentâ€™s \r\n  caption all identified the crime as CSC with a minor in the first degree.Â  However, \r\n  the body of the indictment also stated the victim was 11 years old.Â  Id. \r\n  at ___, 582 S.E.2d at 404.Â  The supreme court noted the indictment was insufficient \r\n  to charge Cohen with first-degree CSC with a minor because the victim was 11 \r\n  years old, not less than 11 as the statute requires.Â  Id.Â  The court \r\n  went on to explain why the trial court also lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to accept Cohenâ€™s guilty plea on the charge of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe question then becomes whether the indictment otherwise \r\n  sufficiently states the offense of second degree CSC with a minor.Â  The indictment \r\n  appears to sufficiently allege second degree CSC with a minor because it charges \r\n  that respondent engaged in a sexual battery with a victim of eleven years of \r\n  age.Â  However, the body of the indictment includes the language â€œcriminal sexual \r\n  conduct with a minor in the first degree.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The inclusion \r\n  of the â€œfirst degreeâ€ language is not a scrivenerâ€™s error given that the title \r\n  and caption of the indictment both indicate the indictment is for first degree \r\n  CSC with a minor.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nFurther, the indictment does not sufficiently inform the \r\n  court as to what judgment to pronounce. . . .Â  Therefore the plea court was \r\n  without subject matter jurisdiction to accept respondentâ€™s plea to second degree \r\n  CSC with a minor.\r\n\r\nId. at ___, 582 S.E.2d at 405.\r\nBoth the caption of the indictment and the title \r\n  preceding the body indicated Ellison was charged with first-degree CSC with \r\n  a minor, a crime that was not alleged, factually or by name, in the body of \r\n  the indictment.Â  The body of the indictment contained a statutory reference \r\n  indicating Ellisonâ€™s conduct was a violation of the statute prohibiting CSC \r\n  with minors, but did not identify a crime by name.Â  However, the body of the \r\n  indictment contained allegations sufficient to accuse Ellison of second-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor and first and second-degree CSC.Â  Then, at the beginning of \r\n  trial, the indictment was amended to change the statutory reference to the section \r\n  prohibiting first-degree CSC, and the assistant solicitor indicated this change \r\n  was no surprise to Ellison as it was the intended charge all along.Â  By this \r\n  point, if not before, it was unclear what judgment the court could pronounce \r\n  and sentence it could impose, as was the case in Cohen.Â  This fact is \r\n  evidenced by the courtâ€™s submission of second-degree CSC with a minor to the \r\n  jury as a lesser-included offense.Â  It is unclear whether any conviction could \r\n  be had on this indictment.Â  But, even if it could have supported a conviction \r\n  for first-degree CSC, it did not confer jurisdiction on the charge of second-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor because it is not a lesser-included offense of first-degree\r\nCSC.&nbsp; \r\nThe test to determine whether an offense is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of another is whether the greater offense contains all of the elements \r\n  of the lesser offense.Â  Joseph v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 555, 571 S.E.2d \r\n  280, 282 (2002).Â  Because second-degree CSC with a minor requires the victim \r\n  be between the ages of 11 and 14, it is not a lesser-included offense of first-degree \r\n  CSC, which contains no element regarding the victimâ€™s age.Â  Viewing this indictment \r\n  with a â€œpractical eyeâ€ we are compelled to conclude the court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to convict Ellison of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  See \r\n  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993) (noting â€œthat \r\n  in viewing the sufficiency of an indictment we must look at the issue with a \r\n  practical eye in view of the surrounding circumstancesâ€).Â  \r\n VACATED. \r\n  [1] \r\n    \r\n HEARN, C.J., and CONNOR, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because of our resolution of this issue, we need not address \r\n    Ellisonâ€™s remaining issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3676","title":"Avant v.

Henry McKellar, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3676\r\nHeard April 8, 2003 â€“ Filed September 15, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJohnnie W. Baxley, III, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nRoy A. Howell, III and Kristen L. Barr, both of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:Â  Travelers Property \r\n  Casualty Company (Travelers) filed a motion with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  seeking an order identifying the proper carrier for Marty Avantâ€™s claim. The \r\n  single commissioner found United Heartland (United) was the proper carrier.Â  \r\n  The full commission reversed and found both carriers equally liable for the \r\n  claim.Â  The circuit court reversed in part and ruled Travelers was responsible \r\n  for Avantâ€™s claim.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nTravelers began insuring \r\n  Willowglen Academy (Willowglen), a subsidiary of a Wisconsin corporation, on \r\n  August 15, 1994, under an assigned risk policy administered through the National \r\n  Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).Â  Travelers renewed the policy in 1995 \r\n  and 1996.Â  On June 19, 1997, Travelers issued a quotation to renew the assigned \r\n  risk policy with the effective dates of August 24, 1997, through August 24, \r\n  1998.Â  Travelers received partial payment from Willowglen for the premium on \r\n  July 3, 1997, and received the balance on August 13, 1997.Â  On August 29, 1997, \r\n  Travelers issued the renewal policy with the effective dates of August 24, 1997 \r\n  through August 24, 1998. \r\nOn or about July 7, 1997, \r\n  Willowglenâ€™s parent corporation renewed its voluntary policy for its Wisconsin \r\n  holdings with United.Â  Subsequently, Willowglenâ€™s insurance agent, Stan Strelka, \r\n  evaluated whether to add Willowglenâ€™s South Carolina operations to the United \r\n  policy.Â  Willowglen and Strelka ultimately decided to add South Carolina to \r\n  the policy and United issued an endorsement to this effect on either August \r\n  27 or 29, 1997.Â Â  The endorsement stated the effective dates of the United policy \r\n  were July 1, 1997 through July 1, 1998.Â  The necessary notification of this \r\n  coverage and endorsement was not received by NCCI until December 12, 1997.Â  \r\n  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(A), (B) (Supp. 2002) (stating the \r\n  insurance carrier shall file a report of coverage of workersâ€™ compensation insurance \r\n  and NCCI is the authorized agent for filing such reports); 25A S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Regs. 67-405(B)(1) (1990) (stating insurance carrier shall file report of coverage \r\n  as provided in Reg. 67-406).Â  Neither Willowglen nor Strelka notified Travelers \r\n  of the new voluntary policy.Â  The same insurance agency procured both the assigned \r\n  risk policy with Travelers and the voluntary policy with United. \r\nOn September 6, 1997, Marty \r\n  Avant, an employee of Willowglen, sustained an injury arising out of and in \r\n  the course of his employment.Â  Willowglen notified Travelers of the claim. Â Travelers \r\n  accepted the claim and began providing benefits.Â  At the time of Avantâ€™s accident, \r\n  neither Travelers nor United knew of the dual coverage.Â  \r\nTravelers learned of the \r\n  dual coverage on January 5, 1998.Â Â  United had also learned of Avantâ€™s claim \r\n  and the dual coverage in late December 1997 or early January 1998 while conducting \r\n  a claims review.Â  Unitedâ€™s Vice President of Loss Control, Paul Hindtgen, then \r\n  suggested changing the effective date of Unitedâ€™s policy to October 1, 1997.Â  \r\n  Stan Strelka also stated that in his discussions with Willowglen and Unitedâ€™s \r\n  underwriter in late January 1998, it was mutually decided that it was â€œlogicalâ€ \r\n  to terminate the Travelers policy and begin the voluntary policy on October \r\n  1, 1997, given United had not received any claims from Willowglen prior to this \r\n  date.Â Â  \r\nTravelers contacted Willowglen by \r\n  phone on January 15, 1998.Â  Willowglen indicated its desire to cancel the Travelers \r\n  policy.Â  On January 29, 1997, Willowglen sent a letter to Travelers requesting \r\n  that its assigned risk policy be cancelled as of October 1, 1997.Â  On February \r\n  12, 1998, Travelers requested from Willowglen a policy release and a copy of \r\n  the declaration page of the replacement policy and advised Willowglen it could \r\n  not backdate the cancellation until verifying other coverage.Â  Travelers also \r\n  issued a notice of intent to cancel its policy with an effective date of March \r\n  19, 1998.Â  This date allowed for time to give the required notice to NCCI and \r\n  the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-405(E)(1) \r\n  (1990) (stating a workersâ€™ compensation insurance carrier shall file a notice \r\n  of termination as provided in Reg. 67-406); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(F)(2) \r\n  (Supp. 2002) (stating an insurance termination shall not be effective until \r\n  after thirty days from the date of receipt by NCCI).Â  \r\nOn March 9, 1998, Travelers received \r\n  its first notice of the voluntary nature of the coverage with United.Â  On this \r\n  date, Travelers received the policy release from Willowglen requesting an effective \r\n  date of cancellation of October 1, 1997.Â  Travelers also received a copy of \r\n  the declaration page from United showing a voluntary workersâ€™ compensation policy \r\n  in effect from July 1, 1997 through July 1, 1998.Â  On April 2, 1998, Travelers \r\n  issued a cancellation notice with an effective date of March 19, 1998.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  on June 4, 1998, Travelers decided to cancel its policy effective on the date \r\n  of the voluntary policy, as opposed to cancelling the policy on March 19, 1998.Â  \r\n  Travelers performed an audit and refunded to Willowglen all premiums paid for \r\n  the assigned risk coverage after July 1, 1997. \r\nOn May 7, 1999, Travelers \r\n  filed a motion requesting the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission to identify the \r\n  proper carrier for Avantâ€™s claim.Â  In its motion, Travelers asserted a provision \r\n  of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance Plan operated to cancel \r\n  its assigned risk policy as a matter of law as soon as Willowglen secured voluntary \r\n  coverage through United.Â  The single commissioner found United was the proper \r\n  carrier. United appealed.Â  The full commission reversed and determined both \r\n  insurers intended to provide coverage on the date of Avantâ€™s accident and were \r\n  equally liable for benefits.Â Â  Both parties appealed.Â  The circuit court reversed \r\n  in part and found Travelers was responsible for Avantâ€™s claim because there \r\n  was dual coverage on the date of the accident and Travelersâ€™ policy had the \r\n  later effective date.Â  Travelers appeals.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  \r\n  â€œThe appellate courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s \r\n  decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error \r\n  of law.â€Â  Hendricks v. Pickens County, 335 S.C. 405, 411, 517 S.E.2d \r\n  698, 701 (Ct. App. 1999); see Roper Hosp. v. Clemons, 326 S.C. \r\n  534, 536, 484 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œOn appeal from the Workers' \r\n  Compensation Commission, this court may reverse where the decision is affected \r\n  by an error of law.â€).Â  The commissionâ€™s decision must be affirmed unless it \r\n  is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  \r\n  Nettles v. Spartanburg School Dist. #7, 341 S.C. 580, 586, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  146, 149 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTravelers argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in finding Travelers was the proper carrier for Avantâ€™s claim.Â  \r\n  Â Â \r\nA.\r\nTravelers first contends the circuit \r\n  court erred in refusing to apply the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance \r\n  Plan (WCIP) administered by NCCI.Â  The circuit court found the WCIP does not \r\n  supersede the provisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and the regulations \r\n  promulgated thereunder and does not govern the determination of coverage under \r\n  the facts of this case.Â  We hold the WCIP does apply to the facts of this case.Â  \r\n\r\nThe South Carolina General \r\n  Assembly has granted insurers the right to enter into assigned risk agreements \r\n  in order to equitably apportion among themselves insurance for applicants who \r\n  are in good faith entitled to, but are unable to procure, voluntary insurance.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540(A)(1) (2002).Â  Section 38-73-540 further provides \r\n  that â€œany mechanism designed to implement such agreement . . . must be submitted \r\n  in writing to the [Director of the Department of Insurance] for approval prior \r\n  to use . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe WCIP, as administered \r\n  by NCCI, is the only â€œmechanismâ€ in the state for implementing the assigned \r\n  risk pool and has been approved by the Director of the Department of Insurance \r\n  for use in this State.Â  The Director â€œmust follow the general policies and broad \r\n  objectives enacted by the General Assembly regarding the operation of the insurance \r\n  industry in this State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-3-60 (2002).Â  The Directorâ€™s duties \r\n  include â€œsupervis[ing] and regulat[ing] the rates and service of every insurer \r\n  in this State and fix[ing] just and reasonable standards, classifications, regulations, \r\n  practices, and measurements of service to be observed and followed by every \r\n  insurer doing business in this State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-3-110(1) (2002) \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  While we recognize the General Assembly has not specifically \r\n  enacted the WCIP, the Director of the Department of Insurance has followed the \r\n  broad mandate of the General Assembly and has properly acted upon its intent \r\n  in section 38-73-540 to create an assigned risk plan by approving the WCIP for \r\n  its use in the assigned risk practice in this State.Â  \r\nThe WCIP provides the framework \r\n  for the assigned risk pool and includes numerous provisions governing assigned \r\n  risk practice.Â  Without the WCIP there would be nothing guiding assigned risk \r\n  practice and its procedure, such as an employerâ€™s application process for assigned \r\n  risk coverage or the assignment of an insurer to a risk.Â  For example, the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Commissionâ€™s compliance investigator, Joel Scott, testified that \r\n  the only way an employer can obtain an assigned risk policy is by applying through \r\n  NCCI and the WCIP and certifying that the employer is unable to obtain voluntary \r\n  coverage.Â  Moreover, section 38-73-540 obligates assigned carriers to report \r\n  their experience on business written under the assigned risk plan to the â€œplan \r\n  administrator.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540(C) (2002).Â  NCCI is designated in \r\n  the WCIP as the â€œplan administratorâ€ and undertakes to secure the information \r\n  reported by assigned carriers.Â  For these reasons, the WCIP applies to the facts \r\n  of this case and the circuit court erred in not applying it.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe specific provision \r\n  of the WCIP at issue here provides that:\r\n\r\nany insurer that wishes to insure an employer as voluntary \r\n  business may do so at any time.Â  If such insurer is not the assigned carrier, \r\n  the assigned carrier shall cancel its policy pro rata and the assignment shall \r\n  automatically terminate as of the effective date of the voluntary insurerâ€™s \r\n  policy.Â  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court refused to apply \r\n  the WCIP provision and instead relied on Regulation 67-409 in finding Travelers \r\n  solely responsible for Avantâ€™s claim. Regulation 67-409 states, in pertinent \r\n  part,\r\n\r\nWhen duplicate or dual coverage exists by reason of two different \r\n  insurance carriers issuing two policies to the same employer securing the same \r\n  liability, the Commission shall presume the policy with the later effective \r\n  date is in force and the earlier policy terminated on the effective date of \r\n  the later policy.\r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-409(A) \r\n  (1990).\r\nWe agree with the circuit \r\n  court that the WCIP does not supersede the provisions and regulations of the \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (Act).Â  Instead however, the WCIP should be read in \r\n  conjunction with the Act and its regulations and be accorded effect under the \r\n  facts of this case given the WCIP addresses matters where the Act is silent.Â  \r\n  The WCIP addresses the specific situation of the cancellation of an assigned \r\n  risk policy upon the effective date of voluntary coverage, whereas Regulation \r\n  67-409 generally addresses duplicate policies issued by, rather than assigned \r\n  to, multiple carriers.Â  See Adoptive Parents v. Biological Parents, \r\n  315 S.C. 535, 543, 446 S.E.2d 404, 409 (1994) (â€œStatutes in apparent conflict \r\n  should be construed, if possible, to allow both to stand and give effect to \r\n  each.â€); see also Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l \r\n  Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 \r\n  (1995) (â€œThe general rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute \r\n  prevails over a more general one.â€).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nRegulation 67-409 applies \r\n  only where two carriers have issued policies and dual voluntary coverage is \r\n  in effect at the time of the claim.Â  In this case, however, there was not dual \r\n  coverage.Â  Pursuant to the WCIP, the Travelersâ€™ assigned risk coverage terminated \r\n  on July 1, 1997, the effective date of the voluntary policy.Â  Through the application \r\n  of the WCIP, United became the only carrier with coverage on the date of Avantâ€™s \r\n  claim, and thus United is responsible for this claim. \r\n  [1] Â  In addition, the application of Regulation 67-409 would create in \r\n  this case an unreasonable and unintended presumption that Unitedâ€™s policy terminated \r\n  on August 24, 1997.Â  Neither Willowglen nor United intended for Unitedâ€™s policy \r\n  to be terminated.\r\nPaul Hindtgen testified he would \r\n  never have suggested changing the effective date of Unitedâ€™s voluntary policy \r\n  to October 1, 1997, had he known the Travelers policy would terminate as a matter \r\n  of law on July 1, 1997, pursuant to the WCIP. \r\n  [2] Â  Moreover, according to Stan Strelka, the agent who procured both policies, \r\n  his intention was to notify Willowglen and the assigned carrier of the July \r\n  1, 1997 change in insurers so that the assigned policy would not be renewed \r\n  and claims would be sent to United.Â  Strelka stated it was inexplicable why \r\n  Willowglen â€œcontinued to turn claims in to The Travelers rather than turning \r\n  them in to the proper carrier.â€ \r\nB. \r\nTravelers argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in failing to find it performed all statutory and regulatory requirements \r\n  with regard to cancelling its assigned risk policy.Â  The circuit court stated \r\n  Travelers did not file a cancellation notice thirty days before Avantâ€™s accident.Â  \r\n  Thus, the circuit court found the policy issued by Travelers in August 1997 \r\n  would have been in effect at the time of Avantâ€™s accident and South Carolina \r\n  law does not allow for retroactive cancellation of an assigned risk policy based \r\n  on the facts of this case. \r\nThe parties involved in \r\n  this action were unaware of the duplicate policies until late December 1997 \r\n  or early January 1998.Â  Travelers did not learn Willowglenâ€™s policy with United \r\n  had been obtained on the voluntary market until after receiving the policy release \r\n  from Willowglen on March 9, 1998.Â  Initially, Travelers filed a notice of intent \r\n  to cancel its policy on February 12, 1998, but the effective date of the cancellation \r\n  was denoted as March 19, 1998, to allow for the thirty-day cancellation period \r\n  and five additional days for mailing the notice to NCCI.Â Â  See 25A S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 67-405(E)(1) (1990) (stating a workersâ€™ compensation insurance \r\n  carrier shall file a notice of termination as provided in Reg. 67-406); 25A \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(F)(2) (Supp. 2002) (stating an insurance termination \r\n  shall not be effective until after thirty days from the date of receipt by NCCI).Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, once Travelers became aware \r\n  of the voluntary coverage, it then completed the pro rata cancellation pursuant \r\n  to the WCIP back to July 1, 1997, the date the voluntary coverage went into \r\n  effect.Â  Travelers cancelled its policy in accordance with the WCIP and refunded \r\n  all of the premiums earned during the time of dual coverage.Â  The WCIP allows \r\n  for this retroactive cancellation.Â  Thus, the trial court erred as a matter \r\n  of law in finding Travelers did not properly cancel its assigned risk policy \r\n  and that retroactive cancellation was not allowed based upon the facts of this \r\n  case.\r\nC.\r\nTravelers argues the circuit \r\n  court erred in finding the parties mutually agreed Travelers would be responsible \r\n  for claims prior to October 1, 1997, and that United would only be responsible \r\n  for claims after that date.Â Â  The substantial evidence in the record does not \r\n  support this finding of fact by the circuit court.Â  See Baggott v. \r\n  Southern Music, Inc., 330 S.C. 1, 5, 496 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (â€œSubstantial \r\n  evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify \r\n  its action.â€).Â  \r\nHindtgen testified he suggested \r\n  changing the effective date of Unitedâ€™s policy to October 1, 1997.Â  Hindtgen \r\n  thought this would be the â€œlogicalâ€ thing to do since Travelers was already \r\n  handling claims made prior to this date.Â  Upon learning of the two policies \r\n  in effect, United informed Stan Strelka that it had begun to receive claims \r\n  from Willowglen after October 1, 1997.Â  After Strelka discussed the situation \r\n  with Unitedâ€™s underwriter and Willowglen, they mutually decided that it was \r\n  â€œlogicalâ€ to terminate the Travelers policy and begin the voluntary policy on \r\n  October 1, 1997, given United had not received any claims from Willowglen prior \r\n  to this date.Â Â  \r\nThe record is clear the only reason \r\n  Travelers handled claims prior to October 1, 1997, is because Willowglen had \r\n  mistakenly sent the claims to Travelers \r\n  [3]  and Travelers had not been notified of the voluntary policy issued \r\n  by United.Â  There is no evidence Travelers agreed to an arrangement where \r\n  it would handle claims made prior to October 1, 1997.Â  Hindtgen never spoke \r\n  with anyone at Travelers about this arrangement and admitted no one from Travelers \r\n  had done anything to lead him to believe Travelers agreed to handle claims made \r\n  prior to October 1, 1997.Â Â  \r\nMoreover, Travelers sent a letter \r\n  to Willowglen on June 5, 1998, which stated that the assigned risk coverage \r\n  terminated on the effective date of the voluntary insurance.Â  Pursuant to this, \r\n  Travelers cancelled Willowglenâ€™s policy back to July 1, 1997.Â  This is a clear \r\n  statement from Travelers that it never consented to providing coverage for claims \r\n  originating before October 1, 1997. \r\nD.\r\nTravelers argues the circuit court \r\n  erred in failing to find that it was the negligence and inaction of United which \r\n  caused dual policies and the resulting dispute in this matter.Â  Â Â \r\nWe need not address this \r\n  issue because the operation of the WCIP precluded dual policies on the date \r\n  of Avantâ€™s accident.Â  Therefore, any negligence or inaction on the part of United \r\n  in making the proper filings is irrelevant to this coverage dispute. \r\n  [4] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing \r\n  reasons, the decision of the circuit court is REVERSED.&nbsp; United is the proper \r\n  carrier and is responsible for Avantâ€™s claim. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs and ANDERSON, \r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting):Â Â Â Â Â Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  The holding \r\n  of the majority misconstrues and misapplies the law extant in regard to the \r\n  identity of a proper carrier for a Workersâ€™ Compensation claim.Â  I VOTE \r\n  to AFFIRM the order of the circuit court judge.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTravelers Property Casualty Company (Travelers) \r\n  contends the circuit court erred in finding Travelers was the proper carrier \r\n  in the Workersâ€™ Compensation claim.Â  Travelers conceded, before the Appellate \r\n  Panel, that it had an assigned risk policy with Willowglen Academy (Willowglen) \r\n  with the effective dates of August 24, 1997 through August 24, 1998.Â  However, \r\n  Travelers claims that, pursuant to the National Council on Compensation Insurance \r\n  (NCCI) rules, its policy covering Willowglen was canceled automatically when \r\n  Willowglen secured a voluntary policy with United Heartland, which had an effective \r\n  date of July 1, 1997.Â  I disagree.\r\nI.Â  APPLICABILITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA \r\n  WORKERSâ€™&nbsp;\r\n COMPENSATION ACT\r\nInitially, Travelers maintains the court \r\n  erred in finding the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s regulations \r\n  are inconsistent with and supersede the rules of the NCCI and in refusing to \r\n  apply the NCCI rules.Â  This assertion is without merit.\r\nThe South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (the \r\n  Act) governs coverage issues in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases.Â  South Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-5-60 (1985) provides:\r\n\r\nEvery policy for the insurance of the compensation provided \r\n  in this Title or against liability therefor shall be deemed to be made subject \r\n  to provisions of this Title.Â  No corporation, association or organization shall \r\n  enter into any such policy of insurance unless its form shall have been approved \r\n  by the Chief Insurance Commissioner of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nNeither Â§ 42-5-60 nor another provision of the South Carolina \r\n  Code suggests that Workersâ€™ Compensation policies are subject to the rules or \r\n  regulations of any non-governmental advisory body.\r\n The only mention of NCCI in the law of \r\n  South Carolina is found in Regulations 67-404, 67-406, and 67-410.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to Regulation 67-406(A), NCCI is the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s â€œauthorized \r\n  agentâ€ for filing a report of Workersâ€™ Compensation coverage and notice of termination.Â  \r\n  25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-406(A) (Supp. 2002).Â  In its capacity as filing agent, \r\n  NCCI requires that certain forms be used by insurance carriers.Â  Regulations \r\n  67-404 and 67-410 merely mention NCCI.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-404, \r\n  -410 (1990).Â  NCCI has no additional power or authority by virtue of these regulations.Â  \r\n  Regulations 67-404, 67-406, and 67-410 do not bestow NCCI with any power or \r\n  authority to promulgate binding regulations in South Carolina.\r\n While NCCI has compiled its own â€œBasic \r\n  Manualâ€ for Workersâ€™ Compensation and Employers Liability insurance and a â€œSouth \r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance Plan,â€ neither of these documents, \r\n  nor any of the rules contained therein, have been formally adopted as regulations \r\n  in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).Â  According to the \r\n  APA, NCCI, by definition, is not authorized to promulgate regulations and any \r\n  guidance it may provide the Commission â€œdoes not have the force or effect of \r\n  law.â€Â  Section 1-23-10 states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(1)Â  â€œAgencyâ€ or â€œState agencyâ€ means each state board, \r\n  commission, department, executive department or officer . . . authorized by \r\n  law to make regulations or to determine contested cases;\r\n. . . .\r\n (4)Â  â€œRegulationâ€ means each agency statement of general public applicability \r\n  that implements or prescribes law or policy or practice requirements of any \r\n  agency.Â  Policy or guidance issued by an agency other than in a regulation \r\n  does not have the force or effect of law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-10(1), (4) (Supp. 2002) (emphasis \r\n  added); cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-40 (1986) (requiring that â€œ[a]ll regulations \r\n  promulgated or proposed to be promulgated by state agencies which have general \r\n  public applicability and legal effectâ€ must â€œbe filed with the Legislative Council \r\n  and published in the State Register.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-120 (Supp. 2002) \r\n  (mandating that â€œ[a]ll regulations except those specifically exempted . . . \r\n  must be submitted to the General Assembly for reviewâ€).Â  The NCCI has no power \r\n  or authority to promulgate regulations that have the force or effect of law.Â  \r\n  In fact, not even NCCI claims this authority.Â  Instead, it is a self-described \r\n  â€œrating organization or advisory organization licensed in this state \r\n  to make and file rates, rating values, classifications, and rating plans for \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance.â€Â  NCCI Basic Manual, South Carolina \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance Plan, effective January 1, 1999 (emphasis added).\r\nTravelers asserts the NCCIâ€™s rules should control \r\n  the instant case.Â  Travelers cites a paragraph in an â€œAssigned Risk Supplementâ€ \r\n  issued on January 1, 1998, which reads: â€œAny employer having voluntary coverage \r\n  or an offer thereof in a state is ineligible for Plan coverage.Â  The assigned \r\n  risk coverage terminates at the effective date of the voluntary insurance.â€Â  \r\n  Travelers fails to reconcile the above statements with the NCCI South Carolina \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Plan, Section III.Â  Paragraph 6 of that section provides \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n[A]ny insurer that wishes to insure an employer as voluntary \r\n  business may do so at any time.Â  If such insurer is not the assigned carrier, \r\n  the assigned carrier shall cancel its policy pro rata and the assignment \r\n  shall automatically terminate as of the effective date of the voluntary insurerâ€™s \r\n  policy.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nParagraph 2 of Section III of the Plan declares in relevant part:\r\n\r\nIf, after the issuance of a policy, the assigned carrier \r\n  determines that an employer is not entitled to insurance, . . . the assigned \r\n  carrier shall initiate cancellation and inform the Plan Administrator \r\n  and appropriate state organization of the reason for such cancellation.Â  (Emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nTherefore, despite Travelersâ€™ contentions, the NCCI advisory \r\n  provisions do not militate against a finding that Travelers is the proper carrier \r\n  with coverage in this case.\r\nWhen an insured with an assigned risk \r\n  policy obtains Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance on the voluntary market, Section \r\n  III, Paragraph 6 of NCCIâ€™s South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance Plan \r\n  provides forÂ  two separate and distinct results: (1) termination of the assignment \r\n  agreement between the assigned carrier and the assigned risk pool; and \r\n  (2) cancellation of the insurance policy.Â  Essentially, NCCI advises that, before \r\n  the assigned risk policy is â€œcancelled,â€ the assigned carrier must be relieved \r\n  of its duty to insure the assigned risk by the assigned risk pool with which \r\n  it is associated.Â  In his treatise on Workersâ€™ Compensation law, Professor Larson \r\n  explained that if the assignment agreement is not terminated before the \r\n  assigned carrier cancels the assigned risk policy, the cancellation of the policy \r\n  would constitute a breach of the carrierâ€™s assigned risk agreement.Â  See \r\n  9 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law \r\n  Â§ 150.05[3] (2000).Â  The NCCI has suggested that the assigned risk carriersâ€™ \r\n  obligations under the assigned risk agreement should automatically terminate \r\n  when an insured obtains Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance on the voluntary market.Â  \r\n  Yet, as indicated in Section III, Paragraph 2 of NCCIâ€™s South Carolina Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Insurance Plan, the assigned risk policy itself must be properly \r\n  cancelled in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act and corresponding regulations.\r\nThe proper procedures for canceling a \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance policy in South Carolina are found in Regulations \r\n  67-405 and 67-406.Â  These regulations require that when an insurer wishes to \r\n  cancel a policy, the insurer shall immediately notify the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commission by filing a Policy Cancellation Notice, Form WC-89-06-09-A, with \r\n  the NCCI.Â  The Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance policy is deemed continuous until \r\n  the cancellation notice is duly filed and, even then, cancellation is not effective \r\n  until after thirty days from the date NCCI receives the Form WC-89-06-09-A.Â  \r\n  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-406(E)-(F) (Supp. 2002).Â  No state law \r\n  or regulation provides for automatic cancellation of a Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  policy.\r\nEven considering NCCIâ€™s Insurance Plan and Assigned \r\n  Risk Supplement, Travelers is the proper carrier.Â  No advisory opinion of the \r\n  NCCI has the force or effect of a law or regulation in South Carolina.Â  The \r\n  NCCI rules do not supersede the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act or \r\n  the regulations promulgated thereunder.Â  NCCI is subjugated to the law in South \r\n  Carolina.Â  The NCCI rules relied on by Travelers do not have the force or effect \r\n  of law in South Carolina.\r\nThe majority opinion is infected with \r\n  expository error.Â  Because the NCCI rules have been approved by the Chief Insurance \r\n  Commissioner, the majority elevates the NCCI rules to co-equal status with the \r\n  regulations approved by the South Carolina General Assembly in the field of \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation.Â  The imprimatur of the Chief Insurance Commissioner is \r\n  nonefficacious when juxtaposed to approval of a regulation by the South Carolina \r\n  General Assembly.Â  Is there a factual or legalistic harmonious nexus inter \r\n  sese the NCCI rules and legislatively approved regulations?Â  In fact, \r\n  it is not a vel non because the NCCI rules inevitably occupy an \r\n  inferior status.\r\nThe applicable statutory and regulatory provisions \r\n  of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act govern the determination of \r\n  coverage in this case.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      II.Â  IDENTITY OF PROPER CARRIER\r\n      A.Â  Travelers had not Canceled Policy \r\n  at Time of Accident\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTravelers issued an assigned risk policy to Willowglen \r\n  with the effective dates of August 24, 1997 through August 24, 1998.Â  Travelers \r\n  accepted the September 6, 1997 claim of Marty Avant and began paying benefits \r\n  under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Substantial evidence in the record indicates \r\n  that Travelers had not initiated cancellation of the assigned risk policy covering \r\n  Willowglen at the time of the September 6, 1997 accident.\r\nOnly Travelersâ€™ obligations under the assignment agreement \r\n  would have automatically terminated when Willowglen obtained Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  insurance on the voluntary market.Â  This did not occur on July 1, 1997 as found \r\n  by the Commissioner.Â  When Willowglen renewed its voluntary coverage with United \r\n  Heartland on July 1, 1997, the only holdings covered under the policy were its \r\n  Wisconsin holdings.\r\nAmy Gilland testified that Travelers issued a renewal \r\n  quotation on June 19, 1997.Â  On July 3, 1997, Travelers received a partial renewal \r\n  payment from Willowglen in the amount of $466.03.Â  The quoted premium was $46,603.00.Â  \r\n  According to Gilland, the partial payment was intended to be a full payment, \r\n  but the check was mistakenly written for the wrong amount.Â  On August 13, 1997, \r\n  Willowglen issued a second check for the balance of the full premium to renew \r\n  the policy insuring Willowglen.Â  Subsequently, Travelers issued the renewal \r\n  policy with effective dates of August 24, 1997 to August 24, 1998.Â  The timing \r\n  is significant.Â  Willowglen did not decide to add South Carolina as an endorsement \r\n  to its United Heartland policy until after Willowglen had already renewed the \r\n  assigned risk policy with Travelers and fully paid the premium.Â  According to \r\n  Paul Hindtgen at United Heartland, notice of the new endorsement was sent to \r\n  the NCCI on or about August 27, 1997.Â  The effective date of this endorsement \r\n  was July 1, 1997.Â  Travelers was not notified of the endorsement and did not \r\n  cancel the assigned risk policy covering Willowglen.\r\nTo cancel the policy with Willowglen, Travelers was \r\n  required to follow the explicit cancellation procedure set out in Regulations \r\n  67-405 and 67-406.Â  According to Regulation 67-405(E), â€œ[i]f the employer fails \r\n  to renew its insurance, or the insurer cancels the policy, the employerâ€™s insurer \r\n  shall immediately notify the Commission that it no longer insures the employer \r\n  by filing a notice of termination with the Commission.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Reg. 67-405(E) (1990).Â  Regulation 67-406 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nB.Â  The insurance carrier shall file a . . . notice of termination \r\n  directly with the NCCI.Â  The date of receipt by the NCCI is deemed the date \r\n  of filing with the Commission.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\nE.Â  Workersâ€™ compensation insurance is deemed continuous \r\n  until notice of termination is filed according to R.67-405 and as provided in \r\n  F below.\r\nF.Â  To cancel workersâ€™ compensation insurance coverage, \r\n  . . . the insurance carrier shall file with the NCCI an NCCI Form WC 89 06 09 \r\n  A. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n  \r\n(2)Â  Insurance expiration, termination or cancellation shall not be effective \r\n  until after thirty days from the date of receipt by NCCI of the NCCI Form WC \r\n  89 06 09 A.\r\n  \r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-406 (Supp. 2002).Â  NCCI \r\n  acknowledges that cancellation of a Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance policy is \r\n  regulated by state law.Â  See NCCI Basic Manual, Rule X(A).\r\nTravelers did not file \r\n  a notice of cancellation form with the NCCI at any time prior to the September \r\n  6, 1997 accident.Â  Travelers became aware of the existence of voluntary coverage \r\n  as early as January 5, 1998.Â  The testimony from Amy Gilland and Joel Scott \r\n  shows that notice of cancellation was received by the Commission on February \r\n  13, 1998, with an effective date of cancellation of March 19, 1998.Â  This unequivocal \r\n  notice that Travelersâ€™ policy was canceled effective March 19, 1998 is contained \r\n  in the record.Â  On April 2, 1998, Travelers sent a second notice of cancellation \r\n  to Willowglen confirming the policy was cancelled effective March 19, 1998.Â  \r\n  Travelers did not, at any time prior to May 7, 1999, notify Willowglen or United \r\n  Heartland that it intended to contest coverage for the Avant claim, even though \r\n  Travelers was aware as early as January 5, 1998, that there was duplicate coverage.Â  \r\n  While Travelers later attempted to change the effective cancellation date to \r\n  August 24, 1997, by sending a subsequent notice of cancellation on June 5, 1998, \r\n  the second notice is null and void because the earlier notice had already cancelled \r\n  the policy.Â  Travelers was attempting to cancel a policy that had been canceled \r\n  three months earlier.Â  An insurance policy cannot be cancelled twice.Â  Moreover, \r\n  Regulation 67-406(F)(2) states that cancellation â€œshall not be effectiveâ€ until \r\n  thirty days after the proper notice of cancellation form is filed with the\r\nNCCI.\r\nAdditionally, Travelers issued a new \r\n  policy to Willowglen after Willowglen had been insured by United Heartland on \r\n  the voluntary market.Â  Therefore, even if Travelers had cancelled the policy \r\n  in effect at the time Willowglen obtained a voluntary policy in July 1997, the \r\n  new Travelers policy issued in August 1997 would have been in effect on September \r\n  6, 1997.\r\nThe Travelers policy had not been canceled and \r\n  was in effect at the time of Avantâ€™s September 6, 1997 accident.Â  The Travelers \r\n  policy remained in effect until March 19, 1998.\r\nB. Â Travelers Policy had Later Effective \r\n  Date\r\nWhen Avant was injured on September 6, \r\n  1997, Willowglen was seemingly covered by two insurance policies.Â  The Travelers \r\n  policy became effective on August 24, 1997 and remained in effect until March \r\n  19, 1998.Â  The record reveals United Heartland issued a policy covering Willowglen, \r\n  with an effective date of July 1, 1997.Â  In such cases, Regulation 67-409 determines \r\n  which carrier is liable for benefits.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-409 \r\n  (1990).Â  Pursuant to Regulation 67-409(A), â€œ[w]hen duplicate or dual coverage \r\n  exists by reason of two different insurance carriers issuing two policies to \r\n  the same employer securing the same liability, the Commission shall presume \r\n  the policy with the later effective date is in force and the earlier policy \r\n  terminated on the effective date of the later policy.â€Â  (Emphasis added). This \r\n  mandatory language creates an irrebuttable presumption that the Travelers policy \r\n  with the effective date of August 24, 1997 was in force on September 6, 1997, \r\n  not the United Heartland policy.\r\nThis presumption is supported by the fact that \r\n  Travelers accepted Avantâ€™s claim for the September 6, 1997 accident and paid \r\n  benefits in excess of $40,000, even after discovering the dual coverage issue \r\n  in early January 1998.Â  Travelers did not pursue legal action until May 7, 1999, \r\n  when Travelers filed a motion requesting the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  to identify the proper carrier for the Avant claim.Â  Willowglen continued to \r\n  pay and Travelers continued to accept premiums after issuing the August 1997-98 \r\n  renewal policy.\r\nBecause the renewal policy issued by Travelers \r\n  effective August 24, 1997 has a later effective date than the United Heartland \r\n  policy issued July 1, 1997, the law presumes the United Heartland policy was \r\n  terminated after August 24, 1997.Â  Therefore, by virtue of Regulation 67-409, \r\n  only the Travelers policy was in effect on September 6, 1997.Â  The Act and the \r\n  regulations clearly presume the Travelers policy covers Avantâ€™s accident on \r\n  September 6, 1997.\r\nC.Â  Retroactive Cancellation of Workersâ€™ Compensation not \r\n  Permitted&nbsp;\r\n Under these Facts\r\nTravelers argues the â€œcircuit court erred \r\n  in finding that retroactive cancellation of a policy is not permissible under \r\n  any circumstances.â€Â  This is a misstatement of the judgeâ€™s order.Â  The judge \r\n  held: â€œSouth Carolina law does not permit retroactive cancellation of workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation insurance except in one limited circumstance: where there are dual \r\n  policies with the same effective date.â€Â  (emphasis in judgeâ€™s order).Â  \r\n  This is a correct statement of law.Â  The only provision for retroactive cancellation \r\n  of a Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance policy is found at 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. \r\n  67-409(B) (1990).Â  â€œWhen both policies carry the same effective date, one policy \r\n  may be cancelled by filing a notice of termination retroactive to the date of \r\n  the policyâ€™s inception.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-409(B) (1990).\r\nThe general rule is found at 25A S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Reg. 67-406(F)(2) (Supp. 2002): â€œInsurance expiration, termination or cancellation \r\n  shall not be effective until after thirty days from the date of receipt by NCCI \r\n  of the NCCI Form WC 89 06 09 A.â€Â  Travelers cites no statute, regulation, or \r\n  case that would permit Travelers to retroactively cancel a Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  insurance policy under any other circumstance.\r\nThe Travelers policy and the United Heartland policy \r\n  at issue do not have the â€œsame effective date.â€Â  Accordingly, the law does not \r\n  permit Travelers to cancel its policy retroactively.\r\nFurthermore, public policy dictates that \r\n  retroactive cancellation of Workersâ€™ Compensation insurance be the exception, \r\n  not the rule.Â  Professor Larson articulated: â€œIn view of the essential role \r\n  of insurance in the compensation process, and the serious potential effects \r\n  of noninsurance on both employer and employee, requirements for cancellation \r\n  of insurance are generally exacting, and are strictly construed and applied.â€Â  \r\n  9 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law \r\n  Â§ 150.03[1] (2000) (emphasis added).Â  Thus, South Carolinaâ€™s regulations on \r\n  cancellation should be strictly construed and applied.Â  These regulations cannot \r\n  be circumvented by an advisory policy.Â  Cancellation of a Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  insurance policy is regulated by state law.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTravelers is the proper carrier with \r\n  coverage.Â  United Heartland has no liability for benefits in this case under \r\n  the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  I VOTE to AFFIRM \r\n  the order of the circuit court judge finding that Travelers is solely responsible \r\n  for providing coverage of Avantâ€™s claim.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Moreover, as a policy matter, to deny the effect of the WCIP in \r\n    this case would encourage voluntary insurers to receive premiums and set effective \r\n    dates prior to the effective date of an assigned risk policy.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  It should also be noted that the record does not definitively show \r\n    that United made the proper filing with NCCI changing the effective date of \r\n    its voluntary policy, nor did United ever cancel its policy.Â  See 25A \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(D) (Supp. 2002) (stating the insurance carrier \r\n    shall file with NCCI a report of coverage and endorsements within thirty days \r\n    of the policyâ€™s effective date).Â  Thus, the effective date of Unitedâ€™s policy \r\n    remains July 1, 1997.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  Strelka stated Willowglenâ€™s intent, through his agency, was to \r\n    place its workersâ€™ compensation insurance in the voluntary market and allow \r\n    the Travelers policy to lapse.Â  However, Willowglen mistakenly paid premiums \r\n    to Travelers upon receiving the renewal notice. Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â Â  In any event, in the absence of the WCIP, any negligence or inaction \r\n    by United would not have prevented dual policies on the date of Avantâ€™s accident.Â  \r\n    United did not decide until, at the earliest, August 27, 1997, to add Willowglenâ€™s \r\n    South Carolina operations to its coverage.Â  At this time the Travelers policy \r\n    was already in effect.Â  Even if United had given Travelers notice of its policy \r\n    on August 27, 1997, and Travelers had immediately started cancellation of \r\n    its policy, the cancellation would not have taken effect until thirty days \r\n    later.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(F)(2) (Supp. 2002) (stating \r\n    an insurance cancellation shall not be effective until after thirty days from \r\n    the date of receipt by NCCI of the cancellation notice). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3677","title":"Housing Authority v.

Gray, Jr. both of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.: Â The Columbia Housing \r\n  Authority (â€œCHAâ€) filed this action seeking to enjoin arbitration of its dispute \r\n  with Cornerstone Housing and Cornerstone Columbia (collectively, â€œCornerstoneâ€).Â  \r\n  In granting Cornerstoneâ€™s motion to dismiss, the trial court ordered arbitration \r\n  to proceed.Â  CHA appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 6, 1999, Cornerstone and CHA \r\n  entered an Indefinite Quality/Service Contract (â€œthe first contractâ€) related \r\n  to the federally funded revitalization of a public-housing project in Columbia \r\n  known as Celia Saxon Homes.Â  Under the first contract, Cornerstone agreed to \r\n  perform certain services for CHA.Â  Both parties contracted to use good-faith \r\n  efforts to agree upon the terms of the Master Development Agreement (â€œthe second \r\n  contractâ€).Â  The first contract contained an arbitration provision as follows:\r\n\r\n16.Â  Resolution of Dispute. Â In the event that there \r\n  is a bona fide dispute (i.e., a dispute based upon good \r\n  faith and sincereness, and without deceit or fraud) between CHA and Consultant/Developer, \r\n  Consultant/Developer shall nevertheless proceed with performance of the services \r\n  to be provided and the work to be performed under this Contract, or the Task \r\n  Order in question, pending the resolution of such dispute.Â  In the event that \r\n  there is a bona fide dispute between CHA and Consultant/Developer \r\n  in regard to the payment of monies, then those monies which are not in dispute \r\n  shall nevertheless be paid.Â  This contract is subject to arbitration under S.C. \r\n  Code ANN 15-48-10, ET SEQ.Â  Both parties may present written evidence to the \r\n  Arbiter (a duplicate copy of which written evidence shall concurrently therewith \r\n  be delivered to the other party), and neither party shall consult verbally with \r\n  the Arbiter without the other party present.\r\n\r\n(emphasis as in original). \r\nOn July 27, 2000, CHA and Cornerstone \r\n  entered into the second contract concerning Celia Saxon Homes.Â  The second contract \r\n  contained the following arbitration provision:\r\n\r\n11.20Â  Dispute Resolution.Â  In the event that there \r\n  is a bona fide dispute (i.e., a dispute based upon good faith \r\n  and sincereness, and without deceit or fraud) between The Authority and the \r\n  Developer, Developer shall nevertheless proceed with performance of the services \r\n  to be provided and the work to be performed under this Contract, or the Task \r\n  Order in question, pending the resolution of such dispute.Â  In the event that \r\n  there is a bona fide dispute between the Authority and the Developer \r\n  in regard to the payment of monies, then those monies which are not in dispute \r\n  shall nevertheless be paid.Â  This contract is subject to binding arbitration \r\n  under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.Â  \r\n  Both parties may present written evidence to the arbitrators (a duplicate copy \r\n  of which written evidence shall concurrently therewith be delivered to the other \r\n  party), and neither party shall consult verbally with the arbitrators without \r\n  the other party present.\r\n\r\n(emphasis as in original). \r\nThe second contract also contained the \r\n  following provision related to the United States Department of Housing and Urban \r\n  Development (â€œHUDâ€):\r\n\r\n1.2Â  Role of HUD.Â Â  The parties hereto acknowledge \r\n  that this Agreement and the closings and the consummation of the transactions \r\n  contemplated by this Agreement are subject to approval by HUD.Â  The Developer \r\n  and the Authority agree to cooperate in good faith to obtain all necessary approvals \r\n  from HUD and acknowledge that approvals from HUD must be obtained as a condition \r\n  precedent to any obligations contained herein.\r\n\r\n(emphasis as in original). \r\nThe second contract was sent to HUD for approval.Â  \r\n  HUD did not approve the contract and required extensive modifications for approval. \r\n  Â Subsequently, a dispute arose between Cornerstone and CHA resulting \r\n  in the termination of any further negotiations related to the second contract.Â  \r\n  Based on the arbitration agreements contained in the two contracts, Cornerstone \r\n  filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association.Â  CHA \r\n  countered by filing this lawsuit to enjoin arbitration. Â Cornerstone \r\n  moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Civil Procedure.Â  Following a hearing, the circuit court granted Cornerstoneâ€™s \r\n  motion to dismiss the lawsuit.Â  CHA appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA trial judge may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s â€˜failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of \r\n  actionâ€™ in the pleadings filed with the court.â€Â  FOC Lawshe Ltd.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Existence of Arbitration Agreement\r\nâ€œThere is a strong presumption in favor of the \r\n  validity of arbitration agreements because of the strong policy favoring arbitration.â€ \r\n  Towles v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 844 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe initial inquiry to be made by the trial court \r\n  is whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties. Towles, \r\n  338 S.C. at 37, 524 S.E.2d at 844-45 (â€œArbitration is available only when the \r\n  parties involved contractually agree to arbitrate.â€); see Hooters \r\n  of America v. Phillips, 39 F. Supp. 2d 582, 609 (D.S.C. 1998) (holding issues \r\n  of â€œsubstantive arbitrabilityâ€ are properly before the trial court and these \r\n  issues are whether â€œa valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties \r\n  and . . .

Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., 114 F.3d \r\n  446, 453 (4th Cir. 1997))).\r\nThe determination of whether an arbitration agreement \r\n  exists is â€œa matter to be forthwith and summarily tried by the Court.â€ [1]  Jackson Mills, Inc. v. BT Capital Corp., \r\n  312 S.C. 400, 404, 440 S.E.2d 877, 879 (1994) (internal punctuation omitted); \r\n  see Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Bazzle, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 2407 (2003) \r\n  (holding that in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, \r\n  â€œcourts assume that the parties intended courts, not arbitrators, to decide \r\n  . . . certain gateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration \r\n  agreement at allâ€); see also S.C.

First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, \r\n  514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995); Towles, 338 S.C. at 37, 524 S.E.2d at 844 (adopting \r\n  the reasoning of First Options).\r\nIn this case, the parties signed two contracts regarding \r\n  the revitalization of the public-housing project.Â  Each contract contained an \r\n  arbitration provision that covered disputes arising between Cornerstone and \r\n  CHA. See Jaffe v. Gibbons, 290 S.C. 468, 472, 351 S.E.2d 343, \r\n  345 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œ[W]here both parties have signed a contract, the signing \r\n  by the first party is in effect his proposal or offer and the signing by the \r\n  second party is his acceptance thereof; the writing then represents or evidences \r\n  the bargain between them.â€).Â  The first contract covered the time period from \r\n  the contractâ€™s signing until the parties entered into the second contract.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the parties agreed to undertake â€œgood-faith negotiations, with \r\n  the intention of utilizing each otherâ€™s best efforts, to enter into [the second \r\n  contract].â€Â  The second contract was to come into full force once HUD \r\n  approved its provisions. \r\nUnder South Carolina law, two contracts \r\n  executed at different times but which relate to the same subject matter and \r\n  are entered into by the same parties are to be construed as one contract and \r\n  considered as a whole. Klutts Resort Realty v. Downâ€™ Round Dev. Corp., \r\n  268 S.C. 80, 88, 232 S.E.2d 20, 24 (1977).Â  Reading the two contracts in this \r\n  case together, it is evident the parties agreed that any dispute arising after \r\n  the signing of the first contract was to be arbitrated. See id.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that a valid arbitration \r\n  agreement existed between the parties.Â  See Jackson Mills, 312 \r\n  S.C. at 404, 440 S.E.2d at 879 (holding the determination of whether an arbitration \r\n  agreement exists is a matter to be summarily tried by the trial court).\r\nB. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Matters Subject to Arbitration\r\nThe second issue for the trial court to determine in this \r\n  case was whether â€œthe specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of \r\n  the [arbitration] agreement.â€ Phillips, 39 F. Supp. 2d at 609 (holding \r\n  issues of â€œsubstantive arbitrabilityâ€ are properly before the trial court, including \r\n  whether a particular dispute is within the scope of the arbitration agreement) \r\n  (quoting Glass, 114 F.3d at 453)); see Bazzle, 123 S. Ct. \r\n  at 2407 (holding that in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence to the \r\n  contrary, â€œcourts assume that the parties intended courts, not arbitrators, \r\n  to decide . . . certain gateway matters, such as whether [an arbitration agreement] \r\n  applies to a certain type of controversyâ€); see also Zabinski v. Bright \r\n  Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001) (holding the \r\n  question of â€œwhether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance \r\n  to arbitrationâ€ is an issue for judicial determination but that in making such \r\n  a decision the â€œcourt is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying \r\n  claimsâ€).\r\nâ€œTo decide whether an arbitration agreement encompasses a \r\n  dispute, a court must determine whether the factual allegations underlying the \r\n  claim are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause.â€ Id. at 597, \r\n  553 S.E.2d at 118. \r\nEven when the dispute does not arise under the governing \r\n  contract, the dispute is subject to arbitration when the contract contains a \r\n  broadly worded arbitration clause and â€œa â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ exists between \r\n  the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119 (quoting Long v. Silver, 248 F.3d \r\n  309, 316 (4th Cir. 2001)).\r\nAssuming, arguendo, there is a gap in the time period \r\n  explicitly covered by the contracts \r\n  [2]  containing the arbitration agreements and the disagreement at issue \r\n  in this case arose during this time period, the dispute is still subject to \r\n  arbitration. \r\nFirst, both contracts contained broadly worded arbitration \r\n  agreements. The first contract stated, â€œThis contract is subject to arbitration \r\n  under S.C. Code ANN 15-48-10, ET SEQ.â€ Â The second contract stated, â€œThis \r\n  contract is subject to binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration \r\n  Rules of the American Arbitration Association.â€ \r\nSecond, the subject matter of each contract centered on the \r\n  revitalization of the housing project.Â  The first contract focused on negotiations \r\n  to enter into a second binding contract concerning the revitalization.Â  The \r\n  second contract contained the specific terms of the revitalization effort that \r\n  was to be approved by HUD.\r\nFinally, the disagreement concerning continued negotiations \r\n  between the parties after HUD initially declined to approve the terms of the \r\n  second contract was significantly related to the subject matter of the first \r\n  and second contracts.Â  Thus, even if the contracts failed to specifically include \r\n  the time period when the dispute arose, the dispute at issue is still subject \r\n  to arbitration. See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118 \r\n  (â€œ[U]nless the court can say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause \r\n  is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration \r\n  should be ordered.â€).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Lack of \r\n  Challenge to Arbitration Agreement\r\nCHA argues the first contract was illegal, and \r\n  thus, unenforceable, and the second contract did not come into legal force.Â  \r\n  Because CHA does not directly challenge the arbitration agreement with either \r\n  of these arguments, we hold the determination of the merits of these issues \r\n  is reserved for the arbitrator.\r\nâ€œArbitration clauses are separable from the contracts in \r\n  which they are imbedded.â€ Jackson Mills, 312 S.C. at 403, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  at 879.Â  â€œ[T]he issue of [the arbitration clauseâ€™s] validity is distinct from \r\n  the substantive validity of the contract as a whole.â€Â  Munoz v. Green Tree \r\n  Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 540, 542 S.E.2d 360, 364 (2001) (citing Prima \r\n  Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 403 (1967)).\r\nâ€œ[I]t is only when a party has valid grounds upon which to \r\n  challenge the arbitration clause itself that arbitration may be avoided.â€ Jackson \r\n  Mills, 312 S.C. at 403-04, 440 S.E.2d at 879; see South Carolina \r\n  Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great Western Coal, 312 S.C. 559, 562-63, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  22, 24 (1993) (holding â€œa party cannot avoid arbitration through rescission \r\n  of the entire contract when there is no independent challenge to the arbitration \r\n  clauseâ€).\r\nA. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Illegality of the First Contract\r\nCHA contends the first contract was illegal because Cornerstone \r\n  was not a licensed contractor under South Carolina Code Annotated section 40-11-370(C) \r\n  (Supp. 2002). [3] Â  Because CHAâ€™s \r\n  argument fails to attack the validity of the arbitration agreement itself, we \r\n  hold the legality of the first contract is an issue for the arbitrator to decide.\r\nOur supreme court addressed a similar argument in Munoz.Â  \r\n  In Munoz, the plaintiff attempted to defeat an arbitration clause in \r\n  a financing agreement by arguing the South Carolina Consumer Protection Code \r\n  invalidated the contract and the arbitration clause.Â  In finding the arbitration \r\n  clause valid, our supreme court stated as follows:\r\n\r\nAn arbitration clause may be invalidated under a state law \r\n  only if that law governs the enforceability of all contracts generally.Â  Perry \r\n  v. Thomas [482 U.S. 483, 492 n.9 (1987)].Â  The Consumer Protection Code \r\n  does not govern contracts generally but applies only to certain consumer transactions.Â  \r\n  While the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code may be raised on the \r\n  merits of the contractâ€™s enforceability as a consumer credit transaction, these \r\n  requirements do not apply to determine the validity of the arbitration clause \r\n  itself.\r\n\r\n343 S.C. at 540, 542 S.E.2d at 364.Â Â  \r\nSimilarly, in the present case, section 40-11-370(C) \r\n  only applies to certain construction contracts and does not govern contracts \r\n  generally.Â  Thus, the arbitration agreement cannot be invalidated based on the \r\n  requirements of this statute. Â See Jackson Mills, 312 S.C. at \r\n  404, 440 S.E.2d at 879 (holding valid grounds to challenge the arbitration agreement \r\n  itself include claiming â€œthe controversy arose out of events occurring subsequent \r\n  to expiration of the arbitration agreement itselfâ€ and alleging â€œthe arbitration \r\n  agreement was never entered intoâ€); see also Zabinski, 346 S.C. \r\n  at 592, 553 S.E.2d at 116 (â€œ[T]he [Federal Arbitration Act] will preempt any \r\n  state law that completely invalidates the partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate.â€).Â  \r\n  Further, arbitration is the proper place to raise the issue of statutory licensing \r\n  requirements as a defense to the enforcement of the contract generally. See \r\n  Bazzle, 123 S. Ct. at 2407 (holding that except for â€œcertain gateway \r\n  matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement,â€ the \r\n  parties to an arbitration agreement have agreed that an arbitrator would decide \r\n  disputes covered by the agreement).\r\nNotwithstanding Munoz, CHA contends Cornerstoneâ€™s \r\n  violation of the statute made the first contract illegal.Â  However, even if \r\n  the overall contract is unenforceable, the arbitration provision is not unenforceable \r\n  unless the reason the overall contract is unenforceable specifically relates \r\n  to the arbitration provision. See Jackson Mills, 312 S.C. at 403-04, \r\n  440 S.E.2d at 879 (holding arbitration cannot be avoided when a party opposed \r\n  to arbitration alleges only a problem with the contract as a whole but not with \r\n  the arbitration agreement itself).Â  \r\nIn this case, CHAâ€™s claim of illegality goes to the contract \r\n  generally and not the arbitration provision specifically.Â  Because the defense \r\n  of illegality relates to the contract as a whole, the arbitration provision \r\n  is still in force and the illegality defense can be considered at the arbitration \r\n  itself. See Bazzle, 123 S. Ct. at 2407; Phillips, 39 F. \r\n  Supp. 2d at 609 (holding all issues raised before a trial court not relating \r\n  to whether â€œa valid arbitration agreement exists between the partiesâ€ or whether \r\n  â€œthe specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of the agreement . \r\n  . . fall within the ambit of â€˜procedural arbitrability,â€™ and are within the \r\n  jurisdiction of the arbitratorâ€ (quoting Glass, 114 F.3d at 453)). \r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Legal Force of the Second Contract\r\nCHA contends the second contract was never in legal \r\n  force.Â  Because CHAâ€™s argument does not specifically attack the arbitration \r\n  agreement, we hold that the enforceability of the second contract is an issue \r\n  for the arbitrator to determine.\r\nThe United States Supreme Court addressed a similar \r\n  argument in Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 403-04.Â  In Prima Paint, \r\n  the party who opposed arbitration alleged it was fraudulently induced to enter \r\n  into the contract in which the arbitration agreement was located.Â  No independent \r\n  challenge to the arbitration agreement was made. Â In affirming the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to dismiss a motion to enjoin arbitration, the Court stated as follows:\r\n\r\n[S]ave for the existence of an arbitration clause,Â Â Â Â Â  the \r\n  . . . court is instructed to order arbitration to proceed once it is satisfied \r\n  that â€˜the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply (with \r\n  the arbitration agreement) is not in issue.â€™Â  Accordingly, if the claim is fraud \r\n  in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself â€“ an issue which goes to \r\n  the â€˜makingâ€™ of the agreement to arbitrate â€“ the . . . court may proceed to \r\n  adjudicate it.Â  But the . . . court [may not] consider claims of fraud in the \r\n  inducement of the contract generally.\r\n\r\nId. at 403-04 (internal punctuation marks as in original); \r\n  see Great Western Coal, 312 S.C. at 562-63, 437 S.E.2d at 24 (adopting \r\n  the reasoning of Prima Paint).\r\nSimilarly, CHA argued a problem existed with the second contract \r\n  but made no independent argument regarding the arbitration agreement.Â  Because \r\n  the second contract had a provision requiring HUD approval of the contract prior \r\n  to its provisions having legal effect, CHA argued the contract was not in force.Â  \r\n  However, this argument attacked the second contract without specifically attacking \r\n  the arbitration agreement. See Jackson Mills, 312 S.C. at 404, \r\n  440 S.E.2d at 879 (holding valid grounds to challenge the arbitration agreement \r\n  itself include claiming â€œthe controversy arose out of events occurring subsequent \r\n  to expiration of the arbitration agreement itselfâ€ and alleging â€œthe arbitration \r\n  agreement was never entered intoâ€).Â  Further, the language of the HUD-approval \r\n  clause spoke to the contract generally but did not specifically address the \r\n  arbitration agreement. \r\nThus, CHA cannot avoid arbitration with this argument because \r\n  it failed to allege an independent challenge to the validity of the arbitration \r\n  agreement. See id. at 403-04, 440 S.E.2d at 879 (holding when \r\n  a party opposed to arbitration alleges only a problem with the contract as a \r\n  whole but not with the arbitration agreement itself then arbitration cannot \r\n  be avoided); see Phillips, 39 F. Supp. 2d at 609 (holding all \r\n  issues raised before a trial court not relating to whether â€œa valid arbitration \r\n  agreement exists between the partiesâ€ or whether â€œthe specific dispute falls \r\n  within the substantive scope of the agreement . . . fall within the ambit of \r\n  â€˜procedural arbitrability,â€™ and are within the jurisdiction of the arbitratorâ€ \r\n  (quoting Glass, 114 F.3d at 453)).\r\nFurther, since the failure to obtain HUD approval of the \r\n  second contract is a defense to the contract generally and not to the arbitration \r\n  agreement specifically, arbitration is the proper place to raise the defense. \r\n  See Bazzle, 123 S. Ct. at 2407 (holding that except for â€œcertain \r\n  gateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement,â€ \r\n  the parties to an arbitration agreement have agreed that an arbitrator would \r\n  decide disputes covered by the agreement).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing reasons, the decision of \r\n  the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and JEFFERSON, Acting Judges, \r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Neither party asserts the arbitration clause contained â€œclear and \r\n    unmistakable evidenceâ€ that the parties agreed to have an arbitrator decide \r\n    the threshold issue of whether an arbitration agreement existed between the \r\n    parties. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944 \r\n    (1995) (â€œCourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability \r\n    unless there is â€˜clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]â€™ evidence that they did so.â€ (quoting \r\n    AT&amp;T Tech. v. Communications Workers of America, 475 U.S. 643, \r\n    649 (1986))).Â  Further, a review of the language in both the first and second \r\n    contracts does not reveal language indicating clear and convincing evidence \r\n    that the parties intended for an arbitrator to decide the threshold issue \r\n    of whether a valid arbitration agreement existed. See Merrill Lynch, \r\n    Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Havird, 335 S.C. 642, 646, 518 S.E.2d \r\n    48, 50 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding clear evidence exists when the language of \r\n    the agreement between the parties â€œclearly evinces an intent for the arbitratorâ€ \r\n    to decide threshold issues).Â  Thus, the issue was properly before the circuit \r\n    court.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Arguably, the time between the parties entering into the second contract \r\n    and that contract coming into full effect was not covered by either contract.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  â€œAn entity which does not have a valid license as required by this \r\n    chapter [relating to licensed contractors] may not bring an action either \r\n    at law or in equity to enforce the provisions of a contract.

Bonnoitt, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3678\r\nHeard April 9, 2003 â€“ Filed September \r\n  22, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\nRonald L. Richter, Jr., of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nAlex B. Cash, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n HOWARD, J.:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  This is an action by Gay Ellen Coon (Wifeâ€) to enforce the payment of retirement \r\n  benefits previously ordered by the family court.Â  James Moore Coon (â€œHusbandâ€) \r\n  moved pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, to \r\n  vacate the previously entered final order.Â  Husband asserted the family court \r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order payment of more than fifty percent \r\n  of his disposable military retirement pay to his spouse because to do so violated \r\n  the Uniformed Services Former Spouseâ€™s Protection Act (â€œUSFSPAâ€), 10 U.S.C.A. \r\n  Â§ 1408 (1998).Â  The family court agreed and vacated the prior order.Â  Wife appeals.Â  \r\n  We reverse and reinstate the family courtâ€™s prior order.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn July 1999, the family court approved a settlement \r\n  agreement between Husband and Wife, acknowledging the Husbandâ€™s military retirement \r\n  account was a marital asset subject to division.Â  In accordance with the agreement, \r\n  the order provided that Wife was entitled to one-hundred percent of the proceeds \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s military retirement account for nine years, and following the nine-year \r\n  period, â€œthe plan administrator will be directed to divided the proceeds equally \r\n  between the parties.â€Â  \r\nNo Qualified Domestic Relations Order (â€œQDROâ€) \r\n  was sent to or approved by the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the USFSPA. \r\n  Â Instead, Husband deposited the full amount of his retirement pay into \r\n  a jointly held bank account, and Wife used the funds.Â  \r\nAs a result, Husband was deemed the recipient of \r\n  the funds and was responsible for the taxes.Â  He did not withhold the proper \r\n  amount of taxes in 1999 and part of 2000, so he withheld additional taxes in \r\n  2000 to cover out-of-pocket expenses he had incurred the previous year. \r\nWife then filed this enforcement action, arguing \r\n  Husband violated the final order of July 1999 by increasing the amount of withholding \r\n  deducted from the retirement benefit.Â  Husband responded by filing a motion \r\n  to vacate the original order approving the agreement pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), \r\n  arguing the order Wife sought to enforce was void for lack of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction because it allocated more than fifty percent of his disposable \r\n  military retirement pay in violation of the USFSPA. Â The family court \r\n  heard Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b)(4) motion and held Wifeâ€™s rule to show cause in abeyance.Â  \r\n  The family court concluded:\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the [USFSPA] limit[] this Courtâ€™s jurisdiction \r\n  as to military retirement pay to a total amount not to exceed fifty percent \r\n  of the disposable retired pay.Â  For this reason, any order of the Court which \r\n  attempts to allocate any sum in excess of the said fifty percent is void for \r\n  lack of this Courtâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nOn April 2, 2001, the family court sent its order \r\n  to the clerk of court and to the partiesâ€™ attorneys.Â  Wife served her motion \r\n  to reconsider on Husband on April 6, 2001, and on the clerk of court on April \r\n  9, 2001. Â However, she waited until she received a â€œclockedâ€ copy of \r\n  her motion from the clerk of court, in August 2001, before she served her motion \r\n  on the presiding judge. Â On October 3, 2001, the family court issued \r\n  an order reaffirming its ruling.Â  In its order, the family court also indicated \r\n  Wifeâ€™s motion to reconsider was untimely because she did not provide the presiding \r\n  judge with a copy of the motion within ten days of filing.Â  Wife served and \r\n  filed her notice of appeal to this Court on November 1, 2001.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Timeliness of Appeal\r\nInitially, Husband asserts Wifeâ€™s appeal to this \r\n  Court is untimely because she failed to comply with the requirements of Rule \r\n  59(g), South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Husband contends because Wife \r\n  failed to serve a copy of her motion to reconsider on the family court within \r\n  ten days of filing it with the clerk of court, the time for her appeal to this \r\n  Court has expired.Â  We disagree with Husbandâ€™s reading of Rule 59(g) and find \r\n  Wifeâ€™s appeal to be timely.\r\nRule 59(g) requires â€œa party filing a written motion \r\n  under this rule [to] provide a copy of the motion to the judge within ten (10) \r\n  days after the filing of the motion.â€Â  The notes to Rule 59 state the 1998 amendment \r\n  adding subsection (g) was â€œintended to help insure that the judge is promptly \r\n  notified that the motion has been filed.â€ (emphasis added).Â  As this \r\n  Court discussed in Gallagher v. Evert, â€œ[t]here is no indication that \r\n  the failure to transmit a copy of the motion to the circuit court affects the \r\n  tolling provision of Rule 203(b)(1), South Carolina Appellate Court Rules. [1] Â  Therefore, the time for filing the notice of appeal did not \r\n  begin to run until after the circuit court denied the motion.â€ 353 S.C. 59, \r\n  63, 577 S.E.2d 217, 219 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In accordance with Rule 59(g) and \r\n  this Courtâ€™s decision in Gallagher, we hold Wife was not required to \r\n  file her notice of appeal until after the family court issued its order denying \r\n  her motion to reconsider.Â  Thus, her appeal to this Court is timely.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  USFSPA &amp; Jurisdiction\r\nWife contends the family court erred by vacating \r\n  its prior order.Â  Wife asserts the family court had subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because the retirement account is marital property.Â  We agree and hold the limitation \r\n  on the percentage of retirement benefits the family court is permitted to allocate \r\n  speaks to the family courtâ€™s authority and not its subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Thus, we reinstate the family courtâ€™s prior order.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Definition of Void\r\nInitially, we note the posture of this case.Â  Husband \r\n  brought this motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure, asserting the family courtâ€™s prior final order approving the parties \r\n  agreement was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Thus, our \r\n  inquiry is limited solely to determining the family courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  in this matter.\r\nâ€œA void judgment is one that, from its inception, \r\n  is a complete nullity and is without legal effect and must be distinguished \r\n  from one which is merely â€˜voidable.â€™â€Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham \r\n  and Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995) (quoting 46 Am. Jur.2d \r\n  Judgments Â§ 31 (1994)).Â  â€œThe definition of void under the rule . . . encompasses \r\n  . . .Â  judgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction.â€Â  McDaniel \r\n  v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996) (internal quotations omitted); see also Ross v. Richland \r\n  County, 270 S.C. 100, 103, 240 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1978) (holding that if â€œâ€˜a \r\n  court is without jurisdiction of the subject matter, any action with respect \r\n  to such a cause, other than to dismiss it, is absolutely voidâ€™â€ (quoting Fox \r\n  v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Mich., 134 N.W.2d 146, 148 (Mich. 1965))).\r\nHowever, irregularities which do not involve jurisdiction \r\n  do not render a judgment void.Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co., 318 S.C. at \r\n  291, 457 S.E.2d at 343.\r\n\r\n[Furthermore,] [t]here is a wide difference between a want \r\n  of jurisdiction in which case the court has no power to adjudicate at all, and \r\n  a mistake in the exercise of undoubted jurisdiction in which case the action \r\n  of the trial court is not void although it may be subject to direct attack on \r\n  appeal.Â  A judgment will not be vacated for a mere irregularity which does \r\n  not affect the justice of the case, and of which the party could have availed \r\n  himself, but did not do so until judgment was rendered against him.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added) (internal citations \r\n  omitted).Â  Moreover, when a court acts with proper subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  but takes some action outside of its authority, the party against whom the act \r\n  is done must object and directly appeal.Â  See Cosgrove v. Butler, \r\n  1 S.C. 241, 243 (1869) (â€œIf such departures be not excepted to, the Court may \r\n  consider objection to them as waived.Â  And it may be asserted, as a general \r\n  rule, that where there is no want of jurisdiction . . . , [the Courtâ€™s] judgment \r\n  will be binding, even although affected by irregularity which would have defeated \r\n  the proceeding if objection had been timely and properly made.â€ (emphasis added)).Â  \r\n  Thus, if the family court had jurisdiction over the military retirement account, \r\n  its original order is not void.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Jurisdiction v. Authority\r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction refers to the courtâ€™s \r\n  â€˜power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings \r\n  in question belong.â€™â€Â  Watson v. Watson, 319 S.C. 92, 93, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  394, 395 (1995) (quoting Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, \r\n  442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994)).Â  South Carolina Code Annotated section 20-7-420(2) \r\n  (Supp. 2003) grants the family court the exclusive jurisdiction â€œ[t]o hear and \r\n  determine actions: [f]or divorce a vinculo matrimonii . . . and in other marital \r\n  litigation between the parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable \r\n  rights of the parties in the actions in and to the real and personal property \r\n  of the marriage.â€ (emphasis added); cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 \r\n  (Supp. 2003) (stating the family court does not have jurisdiction to apportion \r\n  nonmarital property).\r\nIn this case, the disputed property is a military \r\n  retirement account, and we are required to examine the federal authority creating \r\n  the property to determine its status.Â  The USFSPA specifically permits state \r\n  courts â€œ[s]ubject to the limitations of this section, . . . [to] treat \r\n  disposable retired pay . . . either as property solely of the member or as property \r\n  of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction \r\n  of such court.â€Â  10 U.S.C. Â§ 1408(c)(1) (1998) (emphasis added).Â  Clearly, Congress \r\n  has chosen to permit the states to determine independently whether to treat \r\n  military retirement benefits as marital property.\r\nThus, we must turn to the applicable South Carolina \r\n  authority to determine the status of a military retirement account in this State.Â  \r\n  In Tiffault v. Tiffault, our supreme court held military retirement benefits \r\n  â€œconstitute an earned property right which, if accrued during the marriage, \r\n  is subject to equitable distribution.â€ 303 S.C. 391, 392-93, 401 S.E.2d 157, \r\n  158 (1991).Â  Therefore, pursuant to Congressâ€™ invitation, our state has determined \r\n  military retirement accounts are marital property.Â  However, were the law as \r\n  settled as this concise statement from our supreme court might indicate, the \r\n  current inquiry would not likely be before us.\r\nNotwithstanding the holding in Tiffault, \r\n  Husband argues the family courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction is limited by \r\n  the 1990 amendment to 10 U.S.C. Â§ 1408(e)(1) (1998) [2] .Â  A brief review of the history \r\n  of the USFSPA is necessary to an understanding of this issue.Â  \r\nIn McCarthy v. McCarthy, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court ruled that the states had no authority to order the equitable \r\n  distribution of military retirement benefits. 453 U.S. 210, 223 (1981).Â  In \r\n  direct response to McCarthy, the USFSPA was enacted, and from its inception \r\n  limited the percentage of disposable military retirement pay that could be allotted \r\n  to a non-military spouse.Â  The initial language restricted the amount the government \r\n  administrator could pay to a non-military spouse to fifty percent.Â  In construing \r\n  this language, some states applied the fifty-percent limitation only to direct \r\n  payments from the administrator but not to the aggregate amount that could be \r\n  awarded to the non-military spouse.Â  See, e.g., Grier v. Grier, \r\n  731 S.W.2d 931, 932-33 (Tex. 1987) (holding the USFSPA did not limit the amount \r\n  of retirement benefits that could be apportioned under Texas community property \r\n  law but did limit the percentage of the military retirement benefit that was \r\n  subject to direct payment); Deliduka v. Deliduka, 347 N.W.2d 52, 55 (Minn. \r\n  Ct. App. 1984) (holding â€œa state court wishing to award a former spouse more \r\n  than fifty percent of disposable retired pay must order direct government payments \r\n  and payments by the member of the military to the spouseâ€). \r\nTo address the various state court interpretations \r\n  of the fifty-percent restriction, the 1990 amendment changed the restriction \r\n  to apply to all court-ordered divisions of disposable military retirement pay \r\n  pertaining to former spouses. 10 U.S.C. Â§ 1408(e)(1) (1998).Â  The 1990 amendment \r\n  to the Act changed the manner in which the payment was restricted.Â  After the \r\n  1990 amendment, the fifty-percent restriction on payment of disposable military \r\n  retirement pay was reworded to apply to divisions of retirement benefits made \r\n  under any court order pertaining to former spouses. See H.R. Rep. No. \r\n  101-665, at 3004-05 (1990). \r\nThe 1990 House Report stated that the amendment \r\n  to subsection (e)(1) â€œreflect[ed] a public policy judgment on the appropriate \r\n  role of the federal government in limiting state court jurisdiction in \r\n  divorce cases involving military retired pay [and] is consistent with the balancing \r\n  of state and federal interests that has been the hallmark of this law since \r\n  its inception.â€Â  H.R. Rep. No. 101-665, at 3005 (emphasis supplied by Husband).Â  \r\n  The report addressed the amendmentâ€™s language by explaining that the provision \r\n  stating â€œthe aggregate amount of retired pay that would be payable to [former \r\n  spouses] would not exceed fifty percent of the service memberâ€™s disposable retired \r\n  payâ€ applied both when a court orders the government administrator to pay the \r\n  amount directly to the non-military spouse and when the amount is paid indirectly \r\n  to the non-military spouse through the retired spouse. H.R. Rep. No. 101-665, \r\n  at 3006; see In re MacMeeken, 117 B.R. 642, 644-45 (Bankr. D. \r\n  Kan. 1990) (indicating the pre-1990 subsection (e)(1) failed to clearly express \r\n  that a non-military spouse should never be awarded more than fifty percent of \r\n  the retired spouseâ€™s disposable military retirement pay, but rather, it appeared \r\n  Congress intended for the fifty percent limit to apply solely to awards \r\n  paid directly by the benefits administrator to the non-military spouse).Â  \r\nBased upon this report, Husband argues the limitation \r\n  is jurisdictional, and therefore, the order was void.Â  Cf. Bowen v. \r\n  Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 566, 490 S.E.2d 271, 273 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding once \r\n  the family court determined property was not marital property, the family court \r\n  had no jurisdiction to address the propertyâ€™s ownership or â€œdeal with [the property] \r\n  in any wayâ€).Â  We disagree with Husbandâ€™s reading of the 1990 amendment to subsection \r\n  (e)(1).\r\nIt is generally recognized that the presumption \r\n  of concurrent federal and state jurisdiction over cases involving federal law \r\n  â€œcan be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication \r\n  from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court \r\n  jurisdiction and federal interests.â€ Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., \r\n  453 U.S. 473, 478 (1981); see Hairston v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. \r\n  Co., 232 F.3d 1348, 1349-50 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting Gulf Offshore); \r\n  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Foust, 869 P.2d 183, 188 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993) \r\n  (adopting the reasoning of Gulf Offshore).Â  However, there is nothing \r\n  in the language of the Act, the amendment, or the legislative history indicating \r\n  an intention to preempt state court subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Having reviewed \r\n  the entire House Report and in light of the history of the statute, we conclude \r\n  the portion of the legislative history to which Husband refers does not evince \r\n  an â€œunmistakable implicationâ€ to limit a stateâ€™s court subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  with respect to allocating more than fifty percent of a spouseâ€™s disposable \r\n  military retirement pay. Gulf Offshore, 453 U.S. at 478.Â  In light of \r\n  its context and usage, we conclude the use of the term â€œjurisdictionâ€ in the \r\n  report refers to this stateâ€™s authority to award more than fifty percent of \r\n  a spouseâ€™s disposable military retirement pay.Â  \r\nThe USFSPAâ€™s savings clause further undermines \r\n  any argument that Congress explicitly directed that the fifty-percent limitation \r\n  is jurisdictional, thereby preempting traditional state rules regarding finality \r\n  of judgments.Â  The savings clause states: â€œA court order which itself . . . \r\n  provides for the payment of an amount which exceeds the amount of disposable \r\n  retired pay available for payment because of the limit set forth in [subsection \r\n  (e)(1)] . . . shall not be considered to be irregular on its face solely for \r\n  that reason.â€Â  10 U.S.C. Â§ 1408(e)(5) (1998).Â  Congress anticipated state courts \r\n  would issue orders awarding more than fifty percent of the disposable military \r\n  retirement pay.Â  However, in light of this prospect, Congress chose not to explicitly \r\n  state that these orders would be void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Instead, this subsection purports to â€œsaveâ€ these orders by indicating they \r\n  should not be deemed irregular.\r\nWe have found no reported case in this or any other \r\n  jurisdiction ruling that when a court awards more than fifty percent of a spouseâ€™s \r\n  disposable military retirement pay that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Instead, the cases addressing this issue have held that an award of more than \r\n  fifty percent of disposable military retirement pay is subject to direct attack \r\n  on appeal and is reversible error.Â  See, e.g., In re Marriage of Bowman, \r\n  972 S.W.2d 635, 637-39 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (reversing, on direct appeal, \r\n  an award of more than fifty percent of a spouseâ€™s disposable military pay because \r\n  it violated section 1408(e)(1), reasoning â€œâ€˜the USFSPA permits a state court \r\n  to consider the gross value of retirement benefits in computing the value \r\n  of the marital estate.Â  However, the USFSPA prohibits a state court from awarding \r\n  the non-military spouse the right to collect more than fifty percent of the \r\n  net monthly retirement payment.â€™â€) (quoting Beesley v. Beesley, \r\n  758 P.2d 695, 699 (Idaho 1988)) (emphasis in Beesley)).Â  \r\nAlthough we have found no rulings directly on point, \r\n  this Courtâ€™s decision concerning military disability pay under the provisions \r\n  of the USFSPA is instructive. See Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, \r\n  480 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In Price, the family court approved a \r\n  settlement agreement in which the husband agreed to pay to his wife a certain \r\n  amount of his total military retirement benefits, which included his disability \r\n  pay â€“ an item not considered to be disposable military retirement pay under \r\n  the USFSPA.Â  325 S.C. at 380, 480 S.E.2d at 92.Â  Subsequently, the husband unilaterally \r\n  reduced his payments to his wife because he had waived an additional amount \r\n  of his retirement pay in favor of disability pay.Â  The wife sought to compel \r\n  the husband to make monthly payments according to the settlement agreement. \r\n  Id. at 381, 480 S.E.2d at 92-93.Â  Relying on Mansell v. Mansell, \r\n  husband sought a reduction in the payments to his wife.Â  490 U.S. 581, 589-95 \r\n  (1989) (holding the USFSPA does not give state courts the authority to treat \r\n  total military retirement benefits as property subject to equitable distribution).Â  \r\n  The family court granted the wifeâ€™s motion to compel and this Court affirmed.Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough this Court acknowledged federal authority \r\n  limiting the family courtâ€™s consideration of disability benefits as marital \r\n  property subject to equitable distribution, this Court held husband should not \r\n  be permitted to complain the family court erred in enforcing the terms of the \r\n  agreement he willingly entered into with his wife. Price, 325 S.C. at \r\n  383, 480 S.E.2d at 94.Â  Notably, this Court concluded the federal limitation \r\n  did not divest the family court of subject matter jurisdiction. Id.Â  \r\n  Thus, this Court affirmed the settlement agreement.Â  See McLellan \r\n  v. McLellan, 533 S.E.2d 635, 637-39 (Va. Ct. App. 2000) (affirming the denial \r\n  of the husbandâ€™s motion to vacate a prior court order because it approved a \r\n  settlement agreement awarding the wife a portion of the husbandâ€™s military disability \r\n  pay in violation of section 1408); Forney v. Minard, 849 P.2d 724, 729 \r\n  (Wyo. 1993) (refusing to vacate the trial courtâ€™s order awarding wife one-hundred \r\n  percent of her husbandâ€™s military retirement pay even though the trial court \r\n  ordered the benefits administrator to pay wife directly, finding the USFSPAâ€™s \r\n  limitations do not restrict state jurisdiction to only fifty percent of the \r\n  disposable retirement pay).Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude the family \r\n  court erred in vacating its prior order for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family courtâ€™s order vacating its prior order \r\n  is REVERSED, and the original family court order approving the settlement \r\n  agreement, which awarded Wife one-hundred percent of the proceeds of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  military retirement account for a nine-year period, is reinstated.Â  We remand \r\n  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, J., and STROM, Acting Judge, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Rule 203(b)(1) provides: â€œWhen a timely . . . motion to alter or \r\n    amend the judgment . . . has been made, the time for appeal for all parties \r\n    shall be stayed and shall run from receipt of written notice of entry of the \r\n    order granting or denying such motion.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]    The amendment states â€œ[t]he total amount of the disposable retired \r\n    pay of a member payable under all court orders pursuant to subsection (c) \r\n    may not exceed fifty percent of such disposable retired pay.â€ 10 U.S.C.

Groves, of \r\n  Charleston; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Orkin Exterminating Company \r\n  and Terminix Service Company both appeal from the trial courtâ€™s order denying \r\n  their motions to compel arbitration.Â  We affirm with respect to Orkin and reverse \r\n  with respect Terminix.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises from a lawsuit filed \r\n  by the Church of the Holy Cross after it discovered termite damage within the \r\n  church building. [1] Â  In 1975, the church contracted \r\n  with Terminix for the installation of a termite protection system within the \r\n  church building.Â  To this end, Terminix drilled holes through the churchâ€™s interior \r\n  concrete floor and installed pipes into which pesticide could be injected.Â  \r\n  This contract did not contain an arbitration clause. In June 2000, after the \r\n  church discovered termite damage, the church entered into a new contract with \r\n  Terminix for a baiting system to be used outside of the church building.Â  This \r\n  2000 contract contained an arbitration clause.Â  \r\nFrom 1976 until 1985, the church contracted with \r\n  Orkin for the inspection and treatment of termites within the church building. \r\n  [2] Â  When treating for termites, Orkin utilized the system installed by \r\n  Terminix.Â  Orkin terminated this service contract in 1985, after the church \r\n  inadvertently failed to make two annual payments.Â  In 1987, the church entered \r\n  into a new contract with Orkin for the continued inspection and treatment of \r\n  the church building.Â  This contract also did not contain an arbitration clause.Â  \r\n  In 1998, the Church and Orkin entered into a separate contract for the inspection \r\n  and treatment of the parish hall. \r\n  [3] Â  This contract contained an arbitration clause; however, it did not \r\n  incorporate or reference the 1987 contract for Orkinâ€™s treatment of the church \r\n  building.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter termites were discovered \r\n  in the church building, the church sued both Orkin and Terminix for damages. \r\n   [4] Â  Orkin and Terminix each \r\n  filed a motion to compel arbitration.Â  Orkin argued that the arbitration clause \r\n  in its 1998 contract with the church is broad enough to compel arbitration of \r\n  disputes arising from the prior contracts.Â  Terminix raised the same argument \r\n  with respect to its 2000 contract with the church.Â  \r\nThe trial court denied both \r\n  Orkinâ€™s and Terminixâ€™s motions to compel arbitration.Â  The trial court held \r\n  there was nothing in the 1998 Orkin contract or the 2000 Terminix contract signifying \r\n  a retroactive effect.Â  Thus, the trial court held arbitration was not required \r\n  for causes of action arising out of the prior contracts.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether a claim is subject to \r\n  arbitration is an issue for judicial determination, unless the parties have \r\n  agreed otherwise.Â  Stokes v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609, \r\n  571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œDeterminations of arbitrability are subject \r\n  to de novo review.â€Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn South Carolina, the test for \r\n  determining whether a particular issue is subject to arbitration is articulated \r\n  in Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C 580, 553 S.E.2d 110 (2001).Â  \r\n  â€œThe policy of the United States and South Carolina is to favor arbitration \r\n  of disputes.â€Â  Id. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â Â  â€œArbitration rests on \r\n  the agreement of the parties, and the range of issues that can be arbitrated \r\n  is restricted by the terms of the agreement.â€ Id. at 596-97, 553 S.E.2d \r\n  at 118.Â  â€œArbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required \r\n  to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 597, 553 S.E.2d 118.Â  To decide whether an arbitration agreement covers a \r\n  particular dispute, the court must determine whether the factual allegations \r\n  underlying the claim fall within the scope of the agreement, irrespective of \r\n  the label given to the cause of action.Â  Id.Â  When interpreting arbitration \r\n  agreements within the scope of the FAA, \r\n  [5]  due regard must be given to the federal policy in favor of arbitration, \r\n  and any ambiguity in the scope of the arbitration clause must be resolved in \r\n  favor of arbitration.Â  Stokes, 351 S.C. at 512, 571 S.E.2d at 714.Â  â€œ[U]nless \r\n  the court can say with positive assurance that arbitration clause is not susceptible \r\n  to an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered.â€Â  \r\n  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  See also Towles \r\n  v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 41-42, 524 S.E.2d 839, 846 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999) (stating a motion to compel arbitration should be denied only where \r\n  the arbitration clause is not susceptible of any interpretation that would cover \r\n  the asserted claim).\r\nThe issue before this court is \r\n  whether the churchâ€™s claims against Orkin and Terminix fall within the scope \r\n  of each partyâ€™s arbitration clause.Â  In this case, the claims asserted by the \r\n  church arose prior to the execution of the contracts which contain the arbitration \r\n  clause.Â  It is therefore necessary for this court to determine whether the arbitration \r\n  clauses in Orkinâ€™s and Terminixâ€™s contracts were sufficiently broad so as to \r\n  embrace disputes arising under prior contracts.Â  Because this issue has received \r\n  little discussion in South Carolina, we look to the federal courts for instruction \r\n  as to the scope of the clauses at issue in this case.Â  It is necessary to understand \r\n  fully the scope of the clauses in order to effectively determine whether either \r\n  is capable of an interpretation which covers the claims asserted by the church.\r\nCourts have retroactively applied \r\n  arbitration clauses to disputes arising under prior contracts, but in doing \r\n  so, the courts have generally found the existence of a broadly worded clause \r\n  which governed the overall relationship between the parties. \r\n  [6] Â  See, e.g., Caraâ€™s Notions, Inc. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., \r\n  140 F.3d 566, 568-71 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding a broad arbitration clause which \r\n  called for arbitration of â€œ[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating \r\n  to . . . any aspects of the relationshipâ€ established that the clause was intended \r\n  to apply to all conflicts between the parties and not only to conflicts arising \r\n  under the specific contract containing the arbitration clause); Zink v. Merrill \r\n  Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 13 F.3d 330, 331-33 (10th Cir. 1993) \r\n  (holding the parties were required to submit their claims to arbitration where \r\n  the dispute predated the execution of the arbitration clause because the clause \r\n  provided for the arbitration of â€œany controversy . . . arising out of your business \r\n  or this agreementâ€); Rand Bond of N. Am., Inc. v. Saul Stone &amp; Co., \r\n  726 F. Supp. 684, 687-88 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (finding arbitrable a dispute arising \r\n  prior to the execution of the arbitration agreement where the arbitration clause \r\n  provided that the agreement extended to â€œ[a]ny controversy or claim arising \r\n  out of or relating to your accountsâ€); B.G. Balmer &amp; Co. v. United States \r\n  Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 1998 WL 764669 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (noting that where \r\n  an arbitration clause speaks in terms of relationships and not timing, it applies \r\n  to disputes even if the claim arose before the agreement was executed).Â  The \r\n  common theme underlying these cases is that the parties expressly agreed that \r\n  all controversies between them, not just those appurtenant to the contract \r\n  containing the clause, were to be submitted to arbitration.Â  That being the \r\n  case, the source of the claim or injury is not dispositive, for the parties \r\n  have manifested an intention to arbitrate all of their disputes arising from \r\n  their business relations, not just those arising under a particular contract.Â  \r\n\r\nWhere the language of the arbitration clause is \r\n  not as broad, courts have refused to mandate the arbitration of disputes unrelated \r\n  to the contract containing the clause.Â  In Sec. Watch, Inc. v. Sentinel Sys. \r\n  Inc., 176 F.3d 369, 372 (6th Cir. 1999), the court found that a clause requiring \r\n  arbitration of â€œâ€˜all disputes, controversies, or claims . . . arising out of \r\n  or relating to the Products furnished pursuant to this Agreement or acts or \r\n  omissions of Distributor or AT &amp; T under this Agreement . . . â€ could not \r\n  be used to compel arbitration of disputes relating to products shipped under \r\n  prior agreements.Â  The court noted that while the scope of the clause was very \r\n  broad and would govern all disputes involving the contract in which it was contained, \r\n  it did not extend over time to affect disputes arising out of prior contracts.Â Â  \r\n  Id.\r\nIn In re Hops Antitrust Litig., 655 F. Supp. \r\n  169, 172-73 (E.D. Mo. 1987), the court considered whether an arbitration agreement \r\n  applied to disputes arising out of transactions related to separate agreements \r\n  previously executed between the parties.Â  The plaintiff asserted claims against \r\n  the defendant arising out of numerous purchase agreements for the sale of hops.Â  \r\n  Later contracts between the parties contained an arbitration clause stating \r\n  that â€œâ€˜any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement, including its \r\n  interpretation, validity, scope and enforceability, shall be resolved exclusively \r\n  and finally by arbitration . . . .â€™â€ Id. at 170.Â  The court held this \r\n  language did not compel arbitration of disputes arising under prior contracts, \r\n  finding each contract to be a separate and discreet transaction between the \r\n  parties for the sale and purchase of hops.Â  Id. at 172.Â Â  The court stated: \r\n  â€œThe record reflects no agreement by the parties to amend earlier contracts \r\n  to provide for arbitration of disputes [arising under those contracts] . . . \r\n  .â€Â  Id. at 173.Â  \r\nWe derive from these cases that \r\n  the mere fact that an arbitration clause might apply to matters beyond the express \r\n  scope of the underlying contract does not alone imply that the clause should \r\n  apply to every dispute between the parties.Â  For example, a clause compelling \r\n  arbitration for any claim â€œarising out of or relating to this agreementâ€ may \r\n  cover disputes outside the agreement, but only if those disputes relate to the \r\n  subject matter of that agreement.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 598, \r\n  553 S.E.2d at119 (â€œA broadly-wordedÂ  arbitration clause applies to disputes \r\n  that do not arise under the governing contract when a â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ \r\n  exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration \r\n  clause is contained.â€).Â  On the other hand, if the clause contains language \r\n  compelling arbitration of any dispute arising out of the relationship of the \r\n  parties, it does not matter whether the particular claim relates to the contract \r\n  containing the clause; it matters only that the claim concerns the relationship \r\n  of the parties.Â  See, e.g., Caraâ€™s Notions, 140 F.3d at 568-71.Â  \r\n  Under Zabisnki, such a clause would have the broadest scope because it \r\n  could be interpreted to apply to every dispute between the parties.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Orkinâ€™s \r\n  appeal\r\nThe pertinent language in the arbitration \r\n  provision of the 1998 Orkin contract is as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT \r\n  OR THE SERVICES PERFORMED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR TORT BASED CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL \r\n  OR BODILY INJURY OR DAMAGE TO REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY SHALL BE FINALLY RESOLVED \r\n  BY ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED UNDER THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN \r\n  ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. \r\n\r\nOrkin argues the arbitration clause \r\n  applies to claims for damage to real property, and thus applies to this dispute \r\n  as a result of the churchâ€™s allegation of damages to the church building.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nWe do not construe Orkinâ€™s arbitration \r\n  clause so broadly as to encompass any and all disputes arising out of the relationship \r\n  of the parties.Â  See, e.g.,Â  Caraâ€™s Notions, 140 F.3d at 568-71; \r\n  Zink, 13 F.3d at 331-33; Rand Bond, 726 F. Supp. at 687-88.Â  Rather, \r\n  we interpret this clause as applying only to disputes arising out of or relating \r\n  to the agreement in which it is contained.Â  Accordingly, if arbitration is to \r\n  be compelled, it must be found that â€œa â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ exists between \r\n  the [churchâ€™s] claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.â€Â  \r\n  Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at119.\r\nAt the time the church and Orkin \r\n  entered into the 1998 contract, the church had not yet discovered the termite \r\n  damage, which forms the basis of its claims.Â  Accordingly, the church could \r\n  not have intended to submit to arbitration specific claims for which it had \r\n  no knowledge, unless the church intended to arbitrate every claim of this nature.Â  \r\n  We recognize the broad policy in favor of arbitration; however, we do not broadly \r\n  construe Orkinâ€™s arbitration clause as applying to every incident of property \r\n  damage, irrespective of the time in which the claim arose or the property upon \r\n  which the damage was suffered.Â  Even assuming, arguendo, that the clause \r\n  may be construed to apply to property which is not the subject of the 1998 contract, \r\n  the words chosen by Orkin in no way evince an intention to apply the clause \r\n  to claims which had accrued at a time prior to the execution of the 1998 contract.Â  \r\n  Although the arbitration clause does not expressly limit its application to \r\n  the parish hall, it contains no language expanding its application to other \r\n  properties either.Â  As was noted in Hendrick v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., \r\n  50 F.Supp. 2d 527, 535 (E.D.Va. 1999): \r\n\r\n[T]he supreme court has never held that an intent to arbitrate \r\n  can be found from the absence of contractual language evincing an intent to \r\n  arbitrate a particular kind of dispute.Â  Rather, the court has held that only \r\n  doubtful interpretations of contractual language respecting the scope of the \r\n  agreement to arbitrate certain kinds of disputes are to be resolved in favor \r\n  of arbitration.Â  To convert that principal into a rule that a [party] may insulate \r\n  itself from pre-existing claims by failing to say so in explicit terms is a \r\n  fundamental distortion of the principle. \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no \r\n  correlation between the factual allegations underlying the churchâ€™s complaint \r\n  and the subject matter of the 1998 contract, and thus we hold the churchâ€™s claims \r\n  do not fall within the scope of Orkinâ€™s arbitration clause.Â  The terms chosen \r\n  by Orkin to define the scope of its arbitration agreement are wholly ineffective \r\n  to broaden its application to pre-existing claims involving unrelated real property.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we hold the trial judge properly denied Orkinâ€™s motion to compel \r\n  arbitration. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Terminixâ€™s \r\n  appeal\r\nTerminix argues that, because the \r\n  arbitration clause in the 2000 contract required arbitration for all disputes \r\n  between the parties, the trial court erred in denying its motion to compel arbitration.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe pertinent \r\n  language in the arbitration provision in the 2000 Terminix contract is as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe [Church] and Terminix agree that all matters in dispute \r\n  between them, including but not limited to (i) any controversy or claim between \r\n  them arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii) any wood destroying \r\n  insect report with respect to the described property or (iii) the described \r\n  property in any way, in any such case whether by virtue of contract, tort or \r\n  otherwise, shall be settled exclusively by arbitration.Â  \r\n\r\nApplying Zabinski, we look \r\n  to the factual allegations of the churchâ€™s claim against Terminix to determine \r\n  whether there is a substantial relationship of the allegations to the subject \r\n  matter of the 2000 contract.Â  The church contends that there is no relation \r\n  between the dispute and the 2000 contract because the dispute concerns defective \r\n  services to the inside of the church building while the 2000 contract was for \r\n  the installation of a termite baiting system in the ground on the outside of \r\n  the church building.Â  We are not persuaded by this distinction.Â  Whether the \r\n  treatment was to the inside of the building or to the earth outside the building, \r\n  the common purpose was the prevention of termite infestations in the building \r\n  structure.Â  At the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration, counsel for \r\n  the church stated the purpose of the 2000 contract was as follows:\r\n\r\n[T]he church called Terminix in the year 2000 and said we \r\n  have got a grand problem out here.Â  Weâ€™ve got termites that have eaten up the \r\n  church.Â  We need to get them stopped.Â  So Terminix comes out, enters a separate \r\n  contract[] . . . to [install] these bait stations . . . .Â Â  And that was solely \r\n  for the purpose of mitigating the damage that had been by the termites coming \r\n  in, inside the church. \r\n\r\nIt is clear from these statements \r\n  that the 2000 contract was executed as a direct result of the damage caused \r\n  by Terminixâ€™s alleged failure to perform under its prior contract.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find the churchâ€™s current allegations against Terminix substantially relate \r\n  to the subject matter of the 2000 contract considering the 2000 contract concerns \r\n  the treatment (albeit by different methods) of the same building in an effort \r\n  to mitigate the very damages complained of in the present dispute.Â  The church \r\n  was aware of the termite damage (and thus the existence of a cause of action \r\n  against Terminix) at the time the church executed the contract containing the \r\n  arbitration clause.Â  In light of the purpose for which the 2000 contract was \r\n  entered, we cannot find that the claims at issue in this case were not within \r\n  the partiesâ€™ contemplation at the time the contract was executed.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the express terms of the clause provide that â€œall matters in dispute \r\n  between [the parties] . . . shall be settled exclusively by arbitration.â€Â  This \r\n  language is very broad, and it is more akin to the language generally held to \r\n  reflect an intention to apply to matters arising out of the relationship of \r\n  the parties.Â  The fact that the dispute accrued prior to the execution of the \r\n  2000 contract is not dispositive where, as here, the terms of the agreement \r\n  are susceptible to an interpretation which covers any dispute existing between \r\n  the parties.Â  See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118 \r\n  (stating that where the clause is capable of an interpretation that covers the \r\n  dispute, arbitration should be ordered); Towles, 338 S.C. at 41-42, 524 \r\n  S.E.2d at 846 (stating a motion to compel arbitration should be denied only \r\n  where the arbitration clause is not susceptible to any interpretation that would \r\n  cover the asserted claim).Â  Because we conclude the arbitration clause is susceptible \r\n  to an interpretation which brings within its broad scope the claims asserted \r\n  by the church, we are constrained to find the trial court erred in denying Terminixâ€™s \r\n  motion to compel arbitration of those claims. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause \r\n  the scope of Orkinâ€™s 1998 arbitration clause does not encompass the churchâ€™s \r\n  claims, which arose under prior, unrelated contracts, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of Orkinâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.Â Â Â  Terminixâ€™s arbitration agreement \r\n  is much broader, however, and we hold its clause is susceptible to an interpretation \r\n  that covers the claims asserted by the church.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision to deny Terminixâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.\r\nAFFIRMED in Part and REVERSED \r\n  in Part.\r\nCONNOR and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  There are

Townsend, Respondent,\r\nv.\r\nPatricia Joyce Townsend, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Dillon County\r\nJamie Lee Murdock, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3680Â Â Â \r\nHeard August 20, 2003 â€“ Filed September \r\n  29, 2003 \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nFlo Lester Vinson, of Florence, for Appellant.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nRobert L. Widener, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This is an appeal from an \r\n  order of the family court granting the respondent Robert L. Townsendâ€™s request \r\n  for a reduction in child support.Â  Patricia Joyce Townsend, Townsendâ€™s former \r\n  wife and custodial parent of the children affected by the family courtâ€™s order, \r\n  appeals that reduction.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties, who were married on March \r\n  12, 1993, have three children, one of whom is autistic.Â  At the time of the \r\n  divorce hearing on June 29, 2000, the children were six, five, and three years \r\n  old.Â  The father is a medical doctor while the mother is a full-time homemaker.Â  \r\n  The father earned $250,000 a year or about $21,000 a month at the time of the \r\n  divorce hearing.Â  \r\nA settlement agreement filed on July 5, \r\n  2000, set the amount of monthly child support at $3,250.Â  When the parties entered \r\n  into the agreement on June 29, 2000, the father had submitted his resignation \r\n  to his employer, Dillon Internal Medicine, some thirty days or so before.Â  The \r\n  agreement was based on the fatherâ€™s â€œincome as of that moment,â€ that is, the \r\n  date of the settlement agreement. \r\n  [1] Â  The family court approved the settlement agreement, incorporating \r\n  it into its order of divorce.Â  \r\nAs anticipated, the father left Dillon \r\n  International Medicine in November 2000, four months after the family court \r\n  filed its order on July 5, 2000.Â  He opened his own medical practice on December \r\n  1, 2000, employing twelve employees.Â  Approximately two weeks after he opened \r\n  his medical practice, the father sought a reduction in his child support obligation.\r\nFollowing the divorce, the father remarried, paid \r\n  counsel fees to adopt his new wifeâ€™s son, and bought a house that carries a \r\n  mortgage of $185,000.Â  In addition to his new home, the father owns a rental \r\n  house.Â  He also has five automobiles, including a Durango that he helped his \r\n  new wife purchase after borrowing $27,000, and three collector Corvettes that \r\n  cost him $915 a month.Â  During the first five months of 2001, the fatherâ€™s current \r\n  wife, using â€œmarital funds,â€ took â€œa coupleâ€ of vacations â€œfor a couple of weeks \r\n  at a time.â€Â  The father also paid to fly his current wife, his mother, and his \r\n  mother-in-law to and from Michigan for family visits. \r\nThe fatherâ€™s notarized, handwritten March 6, 2001 \r\n  financial declaration places his gross salary and wages at $15,000 a month and \r\n  shows him receiving an additional $550 a month in rental income.Â  In other words, \r\n  he earns approximately $186,000 a year.Â  \r\nThe family court reduced the fatherâ€™s child support \r\n  obligation by $895 a month, requiring him to make monthly payments of $2,355.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhile the court of appeals may \r\n  make findings of fact based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence \r\n  when reviewing a family court order [2] , questions concerning child support \r\n  are ordinarily committed to the discretion of the family court, whose conclusions \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. [3] Â  An abuse of discretion occurs either when \r\n  the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon \r\n  findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support. [4] Â  \r\nA substantial or material change of circumstances \r\n  must occur to warrant a modification of child support. \r\n  [5] Â  Generally, a change in future circumstances within the contemplation \r\n  of the parties at the time of a child support award affords no basis for a modification \r\n  of the award [6] , unless the future change is \r\n  one that cannot be addressed at the time because of other considerations. [7] Â  Moreover, a reduction in the earning capacity \r\n  of a supporting parent does not necessarily require a reduction in child support. [8] Â  Indeed, a reduction in child support cannot be based on a \r\n  decrease in the noncustodial parentâ€™s income absent a strong showing by the \r\n  latter that he or she can no longer make the support payments required by the \r\n  earlier order. [9] Â  Where the amount of child support is based \r\n  on a settlement agreement, the party requesting a modification has an even heavier \r\n  burden. [10] Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the family court erred in finding \r\n  there had been a substantial or material change in circumstances to warrant \r\n  a decrease in child support. [11] \r\n  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn our view, the father failed to make \r\n  the strong showing necessary for a downward modification of his child support \r\n  obligation for his three children.Â  First, the father continues to maintain \r\n  a high standard of living, notwithstanding his change of jobs.Â  He has acquired \r\n  a new home, helped his new wife to buy a new motor vehicle, paid for his new \r\n  wifeâ€™s vacations, paid for other trips for her and other family members, and \r\n  made payments for three collector Corvettes each month in an amount that exceeds \r\n  by $20 the amount of the child support reduction granted him by the family court. \r\n  [12] Â Â Â  Second, while we recognize the fatherâ€™s earnings have decreased \r\n  since he left Dillon Internal Medicine to open his own medical practice, as \r\n  he planned to do before the divorce, nothing in the record persuades us that \r\n  his earning potential has been adversely affected by the move. \r\n  [13] Â  His current gross income as reflected in his financial statement \r\n  is still quite substantial and of an amount sufficient for him to honor the \r\n  agreement to pay the sum of $3,250 a month in child support, an agreement the \r\n  family court incorporated into its order.\r\nFinally, the supreme courtâ€™s decision in Sharps [14]  does not aid the father.Â  Aside from the \r\n  fact that the case deals with alimony and not child support (which receives \r\n  closer court scrutiny than does alimony), here the obligation had been set a \r\n  mere six months before, not thirteen years before, as in Sharps.Â  The \r\n  latter case also has no application where the events that brought about the \r\n  change were put in motion prior to the entry of a settlement agreement.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nBEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  \r\n    The father acknowledged that when he negotiated the partiesâ€™ agreement, he \r\n    contemplated that his change in employment could result in a decrease in income.Â  \r\n    The father stated he specifically considered several alternative methods of \r\n    calculating his income, but expressly agreed to an amount based on his current \r\n    income, notwithstanding the fact that he would be leaving his employment with \r\n    Dillon Internal Medicine and going out on his own.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  \r\n    Kelley v.
