Â However, Doe had decided\r\n  to run away from home that weekend.Â  He planned on staying at Chris' house on\r\n  Friday night, then traveling to Marietta, Georgia to live with his aunt.Â  \r\nWhen McBride arrived\r\n  at Chris' house, she went inside and spoke with his mother, Linda Boehmke.Â \r\n  Mrs. Boehmke became upset when Doe mentioned that he wanted to run away from\r\n  home.Â  McBride told Mrs. Boehmke that Doe &quot;says stuff like that all the\r\n  time&quot; and that she did not think that Doe's aunt was going to come to\r\n  Greenville to take him home with her.Â  McBride also told Mrs. Boehmke to\r\n  telephone her if she had any concerns later that night and that McBride could\r\n  then contact Deputy Oslager.Â  \r\nLater that night, Doe's mother\r\n  went to the Boehmkes' house looking for Doe. Â Mrs. Boehmke was concerned about Doe's\r\n  allegations of being abused by his parents, so she told his mother that he was\r\n  not there.Â  Doe's mother also telephoned McBride and left a voice mail message\r\n  asking if she knew where Doe was.Â  McBride did not check her voice mail\r\n  messages until the next day, and she failed to return the call.Â  Â Â \r\nThe next day, McBride found Doe\r\n  sitting on her door step. Â He told her that he was trying to run away from home\r\n  but that Mrs. Boehmke had made him leave her house.Â  McBride allowed Doe to\r\n  enter her home, but she telephoned Deputy Oslager to report that Doe was trying\r\n  to run away from home.Â  Deputy Oslager advised McBride to call the sheriff's\r\n  office.Â  McBride did so, and an officer later arrived at her house to pick up Doe.Â \r\n  The officer later returned Doe to his parents.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nA few days later, McBride noticed\r\n  that her car was missing from the school parking lot.Â  As she was standing there,\r\n  Deputy Oslager arrived and asked McBride what was going on.Â  When she told him\r\n  that her car had been stolen, he began taking notes.Â  She then realized that Doe\r\n  might have been the one who took her car.Â  She advised Oslager of this\r\n  possibility but said that she did not want to press charges.Â  Oslager insisted\r\n  that either Doe would be charged with an offense for taking the car or McBride\r\n  would be charged for allowing him to drive it.Â  McBride then reluctantly allowed\r\n  Oslager to charge Doe with taking the car.Â  A few minutes later, Doe drove\r\n  McBride's vehicle into the parking lot.Â  Oslager removed Doe from the car and\r\n  arrested him.Â  When Doe's mother arrived at the scene, she demanded that\r\n  McBride stay away from her son.Â  Â Â \r\nThe school principal, William Roach\r\n  (Roach) questioned Doe, after which Oslager took him to the law enforcement\r\n  center for further questioning.Â  During questioning, Doe told Oslager that\r\n  McBride had allowed him to drive her car on previous occasions, that she had\r\n  written passes for him to get out of classes, and that she had given him\r\n  passwords to access various school computer systems. Â Oslager telephoned Roach\r\n  several times to consult with him about these statements.Â  Doe also told\r\n  Oslager that McBride knew he was running away from home when she took him to\r\n  Chris Boehmke's house.Â  Oslager communicated this information to his\r\n  supervisor, Sergeant Shea Smith, who began an investigation into McBride's\r\n  conduct.Â  \r\nSergeant Smith assigned Deputy\r\n  Leslie Lambert to be the lead investigator.Â  Oslager assisted Lambert in taking\r\n  statements from teachers, including McBride herself, and other school staff\r\n  members.Â  Deputy Lambert presented the information gathered from the\r\n  investigation to the solicitor's office.Â  Deputy Solicitor Betty Strom and assistant\r\n  solicitor Howard Steinberg agreed that the charges of contributing to the\r\n  delinquency of a minor and enticing an enrolled child from school attendance should\r\n  be taken to a magistrate for a determination of probable cause to arrest\r\n  McBride.Â  A magistrate issued corresponding arrest warrants, and assistant\r\n  solicitor John Rowell signed an indictment charging McBride with contributing to\r\n  the delinquency of a minor.[2]Â \r\n  The grand jury true billed this indictment, and Deputy Oslager later arrested McBride.Â  \r\nOslager took McBride to the law\r\n  enforcement center, where she was booked and fingerprinted.Â  She was later\r\n  released on bond, and the criminal charges were ultimately dropped.Â  However,\r\n  the District's superintendent recommended to the Board of Trustees that McBride\r\n  be terminated.Â  The Board voted to accept the recommendation.Â  \r\nSeveral local television stations\r\n  reported McBride's arrest and quoted sheriff's office investigators regarding\r\n  allegations that she allowed Doe to drive her car, helped him run away from\r\n  home, and signed him out of class.Â  The newscasts described McBride's\r\n  relationship with Doe as &quot;bizarre&quot; and implied that students could\r\n  not be safe with McBride.Â  One of the stories quoted the superintendent as\r\n  saying that he was going to recommend McBride for termination.Â  Another story quoted unidentified teachers as saying\r\n  &quot;There is a lot of gray area&quot; in drawing the line in a relationship\r\n  with a student.Â  \r\nAfter McBride was dismissed from\r\n  Berea High School, the District's equipment that had been allotted to her\r\n  classroom was transferred to her colleagues' classrooms. Â One of her colleagues\r\n  heard Roach accuse McBride of stealing this equipment when he stated &quot;She\r\n  cleaned us out.&quot; \r\nMcBride\r\n  filed this action\r\n  against the District and Roach, asserting causes of action for breach of\r\n  contract, wrongful discharge, defamation of character, abuse of process, false\r\n  imprisonment, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional\r\n  distress, negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence.Â  Both Roach and\r\n  the District filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The circuit\r\n  court granted summary judgment to Roach on all of the causes of action and\r\n  granted summary judgment to the District on McBride's causes of action for\r\n  breach of contract, wrongful discharge, negligence, negligence per se, and\r\n  gross negligence.Â  The District later filed a second summary judgment motion,\r\n  and the circuit granted the motion as to McBride's cause of action for intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress.Â  Â Â \r\nAt trial, the circuit court\r\n  granted a directed verdict for the District on the remaining causes of action\r\n  (defamation of character, abuse of process, false imprisonment, and malicious\r\n  prosecution).Â \r\n  In explaining his ruling, the presiding judge cited the South Carolina Tort\r\n  Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -220 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009) (the\r\n  Tort Claims Act or the Act) as a bar to McBride's claims for abuse of process\r\n  and malicious prosecution.[3]Â \r\n  The judge also ruled that there was no evidence of any defamatory statement\r\n  made by the District and that the prosecution was solely instituted by the\r\n  sheriff's office.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL \r\nDid the circuit court err in directing\r\n  a verdict for the District on McBride's causes of action for defamation of\r\n  character, abuse of process, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn ruling on a directed\r\n  verdict motion, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences\r\n  reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party\r\n  opposing the motion.Â  Parrish v. Allison, 376 S.C. 308, 319, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 382, 388&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007).Â  &quot;The\r\n  trial court must deny the motion[] when the evidence yields more than one\r\n  inference or an inference is in doubt.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;When the evidence\r\n  yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is\r\n  proper.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;However, if the evidence as a whole is\r\n  susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and\r\n  the motion should be denied.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\tWhen\r\n  considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the\r\n    appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve\r\n    conflicts in the testimony or evidence. Â The issue must be submitted to the\r\n  jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the\r\n  mind of a reasonable juror. Â Yet, this rule does not authorize submission of\r\n  speculative, theoretical, and hypothetical views\r\n  to the jury. \r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  319-20, 656 S.E.2d at 388&nbsp;(citations omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcBride contends that the circuit court\r\n  erred in directing\r\n  a verdict for the District on her claims for defamation of character, abuse of\r\n  process, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.Â  We agree that\r\n  the circuit court improperly directed a verdict for the District on the defamation\r\n  and abuse of process causes of action.Â  However, the circuit court correctly\r\n  directed a verdict for the remaining causes of action.\r\nI.&nbsp; Defamation\r\nMcBride argues that a jury issue existed\r\n  as to the publication of &quot;false and defamatory statements by the . . .\r\n  District's employees.&quot;Â  McBride points to the following instances of\r\n  statements or conduct she claims are defamatory and are attributable to employees\r\n  of the District:Â  (1)Â  Roach's allegation that McBride stole school property after\r\n  she was dismissed (&quot;She cleaned us out&quot;); (2) the District\r\n  superintendent, William Harner, &quot;made public comments about Ms. McBride,\r\n  her arrest, and her [alleged] misconduct[;]&quot; (3) &quot;one of the accounts\r\n  attributed comments to unnamed teachers from the School District[;]&quot; and\r\n  (4) Roach and Oslager coerced false statements from Doe in their efforts to\r\n  fabricate charges against McBride.Â  As to the fourth item, McBride argues that\r\n  the conduct of Roach and Oslager &quot;in orchestrating Ms. McBride's arrest,\r\n  for the District's own purposes and in an effort to discredit and dismiss her,\r\n  fits squarely within the category of actionable defamation accomplished by\r\n  actions or conduct.&quot;[4]Â \r\n  We agree as to item 1 but disagree as to the remaining items.Â  Â Â \r\nThe tort of defamation permits a\r\n  plaintiff to recover for injury to her reputation as the result of the\r\n  defendant's communications to others of a false message about the plaintiff.Â  Holtzscheiter\r\n    v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 508, 506 S.E.2d 497, 501\r\n  (1998).Â  To prove defamation, the plaintiff must show (1) a false and\r\n  defamatory statement was made; (2) the unprivileged publication was made to a\r\n  third party; (3) the publisher was at fault; and (4) either actionability of\r\n  the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm\r\n  caused by the publication.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  &quot;The publication of a statement is defamatory if\r\n  it tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of\r\n  the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with\r\n  him.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nDefamatory communications may be\r\n  in the form of libel or slander.Â  Holtzscheiter, 332 S.C. at 508, 506\r\n  S.E.2d at 501.Â  A statement is classified as defamatory per se when the meaning or message is obvious on its face, and defamatory per quod when the defamatory meaning is not clear unless the hearer knows facts or\r\n  circumstances not contained in the statement.Â  Erickson\r\n    v. Jones Street Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C.\r\n  444, 465, 629 S.E.2d 653, 664&nbsp;(2006).Â  Even &quot;[a] mere insinuation is actionable as a positive assertion if it is false\r\n  and malicious and its meaning is plain.&quot; Â Murray, 344 S.C. at 139,\r\n  542 S.E.2d at 748.Â  However, when the statement is defamatory per quod, &quot;the plaintiff must introduce extrinsic facts to prove the\r\n  defamatory meaning.&quot;Â  Erickson, 368 S.C. at 465, 629 S.E.2d at 664.Â  \r\nAdditionally, a statement may be\r\n  actionable per se or not actionable per se.Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;The determination of whether or not a statement is actionable per se is a matter of law for the court to resolve.&quot;Â  Id.Â  When the\r\n  statement is classified as actionable per se, the defendant is\r\n  presumed to have acted with common law malice, and the plaintiff is presumed to\r\n  have suffered general damages.Â  Id.Â  When the statement is not\r\n  actionable per se, &quot;the plaintiff must plead and prove both\r\n  common law malice and special damages.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Common law\r\n  malice means the defendant acted with ill will toward the plaintiff, or acted\r\n  recklessly or wantonly, i.e., with conscious indifference of the plaintiff's\r\n  rights.&quot;Â  Id. at 466, 629 S.E.2d at 665.Â  &quot;Slander is\r\n  actionable per se when the defendant's alleged\r\n  defamatory statements charge the plaintiff with one of five types of\r\n  acts or characteristics:Â  (1) commission of a crime of moral turpitude; (2)\r\n  contraction of a loathsome disease; (3) adultery; (4) unchastity; or (5)\r\n  unfitness in one's business or profession.&quot;Â  Goodwin v. Kennedy,\r\n  347 S.C. 30, 36, 552 S.E.2d 319, 322-23 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n\tConcerning damages, our supreme\r\n  court has instructed:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGeneral damages\r\n  include injury to reputation, mental suffering, hurt feelings, emotional\r\n  distress, and similar types of injuries which are not capable of definite money\r\n  valuation.Â  Special damages are tangible losses or injuries to the plaintiff's\r\n  property, business, occupation, or profession in which it is possible to\r\n  identify a specific amount of money as damages.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nErickson, 368 S.C. at 465\r\n  n.6, 629 S.E.2d at 664 n.6.Â  \r\nAs to the first item that McBride\r\n  claims is defamatory, we believe Roach's allegation that McBride stole school\r\n  property should go to the jury.Â  McBride presented evidence that the statement\r\n  was false when a teacher's aide testified that after McBride was dismissed, she\r\n  took only the items she had purchased with her own funds.Â  Further, the\r\n  statement was actionable per se because it accused McBride of committing a\r\n  crime involving moral turpitude.Â  See Bell v. Bank of Abbeville,\r\n  208 S.C. 490, 496, 38 S.E.2d 641, 644&nbsp;(1946) (holding that an allegation\r\n  charging the plaintiff with larceny or breach of trust, crimes involving moral\r\n  turpitude, was actionable per se and did not require an allegation\r\n  of special damages).Â  Thus, common law malice and general damages are\r\n  presumed.Â  See Erickson, 368 S.C. at 465, 629 S.E.2d at 664.Â  Moreover, there is no question that Roach was responsible\r\n  for making the statement himself.\r\nAdditionally, Roach made the\r\n  statement to a teacher's aide as she was showing Roach some items McBride had\r\n  used in her classroom.[5]Â \r\n  Both Roach and the teacher's aide were District employees.Â  Therefore, one\r\n  might conclude that Roach's statement was not published to a &quot;third party,&quot;\r\n  as is required to prove defamation.Â  However, in South Carolina, an employee's\r\n  statement to another employee is a &quot;publication&quot; when the privilege\r\n  of the employees' common interest is abused.Â  Bell, 208 S.C. at 493-94,\r\n  38 S.E.2d at 643. Â In Bell, our supreme court explained the privilege as\r\n  follows:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\tWhen\r\n  one has an interest in the subject matter of a communication, and the person\r\n  (or persons) to whom it is made has a corresponding interest, every\r\n  communication honestly made, in order to protect such common interest, is\r\n  privileged by reason of the occasion. The statement, however, must be such\r\n    as the occasion warrants, and must be made in good faith to protect the\r\n    interests of the one who makes it and the persons to whom it is addressed. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  493-94, 38 S.E.2d at 643 (emphasis added).Â  In sum, communications between\r\n  employees of an organization are qualifiedly privileged only if made in good\r\n  faith and in the usual course of business.Â  Murray, 344 S.C. at 140-41,\r\n  542 S.E.2d at 749.Â  \r\nDuring oral arguments, the\r\n  District relied on our Supreme Court's opinion in Watson v. Wannamaker for the proposition that a defendant's statement to his secretary does not\r\n  constitute sufficient publication for purposes of a defamation claim. Â 216 S.C.\r\n  295, 296-99, 57 S.E.2d 477, 477-78&nbsp;(1950).Â  However, Watson is distinguishable\r\n  from the present case.Â  In Watson, the defendant made the statements in\r\n  question for the purpose of including them in a letter he was dictating to his\r\n  secretary.Â  216 S.C. at 296-97, 57 S.E.2d at 477. \r\nIn\r\n  any event, even if the privilege has not been abused, qualified privilege must\r\n  be raised as an affirmative defense.Â  See Swinton Creek Nursery v.\r\n    Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 484, 514 S.E.2d 126, 134&nbsp;(1999)\r\n  (classifying qualified privilege as an affirmative defense).Â  Here, the\r\n  District did not include this defense in its answer; therefore, it may not\r\n  assert this privilege.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nTurning to items 2 and 3,\r\n  these are vague references to the local newscasts concerning McBride's arrest\r\n  and are not specific enough to evaluate.Â  In any event, the only statement in\r\n  the local newscasts that was attributable to a District employee and specifically named McBride was the quotation from the superintendent stating\r\n  his intention to recommend that McBride be terminated.Â  This statement was a\r\n  true statement.Â  Therefore, the element of defamation that the statement be\r\n  &quot;false and defamatory&quot; is missing.Â  See Fleming, 350 S.C. at\r\n  494, 567 S.E.2d at 860 (requiring a showing that the statement in question is\r\n  false and defamatory in order to prove defamation).\r\nItem 4 rests on the\r\n  assumption that the charges against McBride were, in fact, based on false\r\n  information.Â  However, assuming, arguendo, that Doe gave false information in\r\n  his statements, those statements were not the only ones on which investigators\r\n  relied in seeking warrants for McBride's arrest.Â  McBride's own statement,\r\n  combined with the statements from some of Doe's teachers, guidance counselors,\r\n  Chris Boehmke, and Mrs. Boehmke, provide sufficient probable cause for the\r\n  charges against McBride.[6]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-490 (2003) (defining the offense of contributing\r\n  to the delinquency of a minor); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-510 (2003) (prohibiting the\r\n  enticement of a child enrolled in elementary or secondary school away from\r\n  required school attendance).Â  Therefore, it cannot be said that the conduct of\r\n  Roach and Oslager in procuring warrants for McBride's arrest constituted\r\n  actionable defamation. \r\nIn sum, although there was insufficient\r\n  evidence of the elements of defamation as to items 2, 3, and 4, McBride\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to support her defamation claim as to item 1â€”Roach's\r\n  allegation that she stole school property.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred\r\n  in directing a verdict for the District on this cause of action.\r\nII.&nbsp; Abuse\r\n  of Process\r\nA.&nbsp; Immunity\r\nMcBride asserts\r\n  that the circuit court erred in concluding that a cause of action for\r\n  abuse of process is barred by the Tort Claims Act, specifically S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-60(17) (2005), which states: &quot;The governmental entity is\r\n  not liable for a loss resulting from . . . employee conduct\r\n  outside the scope of his official duties or which constitutes actual fraud,\r\n  actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral\r\n  turpitude[.]&quot;\r\n  (emphases added).[7]Â \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nThe circuit\r\n  court specifically concluded that it was &quot;almost impossible&quot; to bring\r\n  abuse of process and malicious prosecution claims against the state and its\r\n  political subdivisions &quot;because . . . of the elements of the crime [sic]\r\n  under the South Carolina [T]ort [C]laims [A]ct.&quot;Â  However, a cause of action for abuse of process &quot;contains\r\n  neither an element of intent to harm, nor actual malice.&quot;Â  Swicegood v. Lott, 379\r\n  S.C. 346, 352, 665 S.E.2d 211, 214&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2008). Â &quot;The tort of abuse of process consists of two elements: an\r\n  ulterior purpose, and a willful act in the use of the process that is not proper in the\r\n  regular conduct of the proceeding.&quot; Â Id. at 351-52, 665 S.E.2d at\r\n  213.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, a cause of action for abuse of process is not barred by section\r\n  15-78-60(17) because of its elements.Â  The elements of the tort of malicious\r\n  prosecution will be discussed later in this opinion.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Merits of claim\r\nMcBride maintains that the\r\n  circuit court should not have directed a verdict for the District on her abuse\r\n  of process claim.[8]Â \r\n  She argues that there was sufficient evidence of the District's involvement,\r\n  through Roach, in the decision to arrest her for her claim to go to the jury.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nTo successfully\r\n  maintain an abuse of process claim, the plaintiff must show an\r\n  ulterior purpose and a willful act in the use of the process that is not proper\r\n  in the regular conduct of the proceeding. Â Swicegood, 379 S.C. at 351-52,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 213.Â  McBride\r\n  points to evidence of her bad relationship with Roach and asserts that a jury\r\n  could infer from this evidence Roach's desire to silence McBride and to\r\n  ultimately obtain her dismissal from Berea High School.Â  She also points to evidence\r\n  of the close relationship between Roach and Oslager, who arrested McBride;\r\n  Oslager's repeated telephone calls to Roach during his interrogation of Doe;\r\n  and Doe's testimony indicating that Oslager pressured him to implicate McBride\r\n  in illegal activity.Â  McBride argues that from this evidence, the jury could\r\n  infer that Oslager was working in concert with Roach to assist him in accomplishing\r\n  the purpose of silencing McBride and that they were improperly using the legal\r\n  process to do so. \r\nWe believe that more than one\r\n  reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence of telephone calls from\r\n  Oslager to Roach during his interrogation of Doe.Â  Granted, it is reasonable to\r\n  assume that Oslager was telling the truth when he testified that he called\r\n  Roach only to verify certain information Doe provided to him.Â  However, it is\r\n  equally reasonable to infer from this evidence, combined with Doe's testimony,\r\n  that Roach provided information to Oslager in an attempt to elicit this\r\n  information from Doe and use it against McBride.Â  In reviewing the propriety of\r\n  a directed verdict, neither the trial court nor this court has the authority to\r\n  decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the evidence.Â  Parrish,\r\n  376 S.C. at 319, 656 S.E.2d at 388.Â  Therefore, the circuit court should have\r\n  allowed this cause of action to go to the jury.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Malicious\r\n  Prosecution\r\nA.&nbsp; Immunity\r\nMcBride contends that the circuit\r\n  court erred in concluding that a cause of action for malicious\r\n  prosecution is barred by section\r\n  15-78-60(17).Â  We agree.Â  The elements of malicious prosecution are\r\n  (1) the institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings; (2) by or\r\n  at the instance of the defendant; (3) termination of such proceedings in\r\n  plaintiff's favor; (4) malice in instituting such proceedings; (5) lack of\r\n  probable cause; and (6) resulting injury or damage.Â  Law, 368 S.C. at 435,\r\n  629 S.E.2d at 648.Â  In this cause of action, malice is &quot;the deliberate\r\n  intentional doing of a wrongful act without just cause or excuse.&quot;Â  Eaves\r\n    v. Broad River Elec. Coop., Inc., 277 S.C. 475, 479, 289 S.E.2d 414, 416\r\n  (1982) (internal quotation omitted).Â  It does not necessarily\r\n  mean a defendant acted out of spite, revenge, or with a malignant disposition.Â  Law, 368 S.C. at 437, 629 S.E.2d at 649.\r\n\r\n\tMalice also may proceed from an ill-regulated mind which is not\r\n  sufficiently cautious before causing injury to another person. Moreover, malice\r\n  may be implied where the evidence reveals a disregard of the\r\n  consequences of an injurious act, without reference to any special injury that\r\n  may be inflicted on another person. Â Malice also may be implied in the\r\n  doing of an illegal act for one's own gratification or purpose without regard\r\n  to the rights of others or the injury which may be inflicted on another person.\r\n  In an action for malicious prosecution, malice may be inferred from a\r\n  lack of probable cause to institute the prosecution.\r\n\r\nId. (emphases\r\n  added).\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, one need not show actual malice in order to successfully\r\n  maintain an action for malicious prosecution.Â  Therefore, the circuit court\r\n  erred in concluding that a cause of action for malicious prosecution is barred\r\n  by section\r\n  15-78-60(17) because of its elements.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Merits of claim\r\nMcBride contends that there was\r\n  sufficient evidence of the elements of malicious prosecution to withstand the\r\n  District's directed verdict motion.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs previously stated, the\r\n  elements of malicious prosecution are (1) the institution or continuation of\r\n  original judicial proceedings; (2) by or at the instance of the defendant; (3)\r\n  termination of such proceedings in plaintiff's favor; (4) malice in instituting\r\n  such proceedings; (5) lack of probable cause; and (6) resulting injury or\r\n  damage.Â  Law, 368 S.C. at 435, 629 S.E.2d at 648.Â  Here, McBride\r\n  has failed to show a lack of probable cause for pursuit of the charges against\r\n  her.Â  \r\n\r\n\tProbable cause means &quot;the extent of such facts and\r\n  circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable mind acting on the\r\n  facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor that the person charged was guilty\r\n  of a crime for which he has been charged, and only those facts and\r\n  circumstances which were or should have been known to the prosecutor at the time\r\n  he instituted the prosecution should be considered.&quot; Â In determining the\r\n  existence of probable cause, the facts must be &quot;regarded from the point of\r\n  view of the party prosecuting; the question is not what the actual facts were,\r\n  but what he honestly believed them to be.&quot; Â South Carolina has long\r\n    embraced the rule that a true bill of indictment is prima facie evidence of\r\n    probable cause in an action for malicious prosecution. Â Although the\r\n  question of whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may\r\n  be decided as a matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion. \r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  436, 629 S.E.2d at 649 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn McBride's case, the grand\r\n  jury's true bill of the indictment against her for contributing to the delinquency\r\n  of a minor is prima facie evidence of probable cause as to that charge. Â Further,\r\n  the information in several witness statements supports a finding that the\r\n  sheriff's department had probable cause to pursue both the charge for\r\n  contributing to the delinquency of a minor and the charge for enticing an\r\n  enrolled child from attendance in school.Â  Therefore, the circuit court\r\n  properly directed a verdict for the District on McBride's malicious prosecution\r\n  claim. \r\nIV.&nbsp; False\r\n  Imprisonment\r\nMcBride asserts that a directed\r\n  verdict for the District on her claim for false imprisonment was inappropriate.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  essence of the tort of false imprisonment consists of depriving a person of his\r\n  liberty without lawful justification. Â To prevail on a claim for false\r\n  imprisonment, the plaintiff must establish: (1) the defendant restrained the\r\n  plaintiff, (2) the restraint was intentional, and (3) the restraint was\r\n  unlawful.\r\n\tThe fundamental issue in determining the lawfulness of an arrest\r\n  is whether there was probable cause to make the arrest. Â Probable cause is\r\n  defined as a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this\r\n  belief rests on such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious\r\n  man, under the circumstances, to believe likewise. Â Although the question of\r\n  whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided\r\n  as a matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion.\r\n\r\nLaw,\r\n  368 S.C. at 440-41, 629 S.E.2d at 651 (citations omitted).\r\nHere, McBride has failed to show\r\n  a lack of probable cause for her arrest. Â The information in several witness\r\n  statements supports a finding that the sheriff's department had probable cause\r\n  to arrest McBride for the offenses of contributing to the delinquency of a\r\n  minor and enticing an enrolled child from attendance in school.Â  Further, an\r\n  assistant solicitor testified that he believed there was probable cause to take\r\n  the charges to a magistrate for the issuance of an arrest warrant.Â  Based on\r\n  the foregoing, the circuit court properly directed a verdict for the District\r\n  on McBride's false imprisonment claim.Â  \r\nIn view of our disposition\r\n  of the foregoing issues, we need not address McBride's remaining arguments. Â See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n  (1999) (stating that the appellate court need not\r\n  review remaining issues when its determination of a prior\r\n    issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s directed verdict for the District as to the causes of action\r\n  for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.Â  We reverse the directed\r\n  verdict as to defamation and abuse of process and remand for a new trial on\r\n  these causes of action.\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.Â  Â \r\nPIEPER, J., and\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The former\r\n  student's named has been changed to protect his identity.\r\n[2] There is\r\n  nothing in the record indicating that the solicitor's office presented an\r\n  indictment to the grand jury for the charge of enticing an enrolled child from\r\n  attendance in school.Â  The likely reason is that the charge was for a first\r\n  offense, and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-510 (2003) requires a first or second\r\n  offense to be tried exclusively in magistrate's court.Â  Further, S.C. Const. art.\r\n  I, Â§ 11 and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003) exempt charges prosecuted in\r\n  magistrate's court from the requirement that an indictment be presented to a\r\n  grand jury before a criminal charge is prosecuted.\r\n[3] See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 15-78-60(17) (2005) (&quot;The governmental entity is not liable\r\n  for a loss resulting from . . . employee conduct outside the scope of his official duties or which\r\n  constitutes actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving\r\n  moral turpitude[.]&quot;).Â  \r\n[4] See Murray v.

Novich, 300 S.C. 334, 337, 387 S.E.2d 704,\r\n  706&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1989) (holding that because counsel made no motion to\r\n  strike the offending testimony from the record, the trial court did not err in\r\n  admitting the testimony after sustaining counsel's objection on the ground of\r\n  irrelevancy).Â  \r\n[6] See Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 441, 629 S.E.2d 642, 651&nbsp;(2006) (defining probable cause to make an arrest as &quot;a\r\n  good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this belief rests on\r\n  such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the\r\n  circumstances, to believe likewise.&quot;).\r\n[7] Although the\r\n  District cited in its answer several additional exceptions to the waiver of\r\n  immunity under section 15-78-60,\r\n  counsel raised only subsection 17 in its directed verdict motion and thus the\r\n  circuit court addressed only that exception.Â  Â Â \r\n[8] In addition to\r\n  concluding that the abuse of process claim was barred by the Tort Claims Act,\r\n  the circuit court concluded that there was no evidence to find that the District\r\n  instituted any process.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4719","title":"Pruitt v.

Pruitt (Wife). Â We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nWife filed this action in January\r\n  2007, seeking a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  Husband filed an answer\r\n  admitting the adultery but alleging that Wife forgave him.Â  In March 2007, the\r\n  family court issued a consent order granting temporary alimony pending further\r\n  order of the court.Â  Wife then amended her complaint to add Sister as a party\r\n  to the action because title to the marital home and title to the real estate\r\n  associated with Husband's business were in Sister's name.Â  Sister answered,\r\n  alleging that she loaned Husband money over a period of several years and that\r\n  Husband conveyed the disputed property to Sister at her request following his\r\n  failure to repay her.Â  \r\nThe family court granted Wife and\r\n  Husband a divorce on the ground of one year of continuous separation.Â  The\r\n  family court also granted Wife a lump sum award representing 55 percent of the\r\n  marital estate as well as attorney's fees in the amount of $10,000.Â  The family court\r\n  ordered Sister to execute a deed conveying to Husband the marital home and the real estate\r\n  associated with his\r\n  business. Â Husband and Sister then filed motions for reconsideration. Â The\r\n  family court denied Sister's motion but granted Husband's motion in part,\r\n  allowing him a credit for the temporary alimony paid to Wife after the month of\r\n  December 2007.[2]Â \r\n  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  Â Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family\r\n  court properly find that Sister did not loan $40,000 to Husband?\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family\r\n  court err in concluding that the marital home was transmuted into marital\r\n  property?\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family court\r\n  err in failing to consider the marital debts in determining the value of the\r\n  marital estate?\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family\r\n  court err in valuing the marital assets?\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family court\r\n  err in concluding that Husband's adultery was the sole reason for the breakup\r\n  of the marriage, thus entitling Wife to a greater percentage of the marital\r\n  estate?\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family\r\n  court err in failing to consider gifts from Husband's family when distributing\r\n  the parties' household furnishings?\r\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family\r\n  court err in refusing to deduct from Wife's equitable distribution award the\r\n  full amount of temporary alimony she received from Husband because her adultery\r\n  disqualified her from receiving alimony?\r\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family\r\n  court err in awarding attorney's fees to Wife? Â Â \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nFindings\r\n&quot;In appeals from the family court,\r\n  this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence.&quot; &nbsp;Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C.\r\n  182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct.

Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct.

Loan\r\nHusband and Sister challenge\r\n  the family court's finding that Sister did not loan $40,000 to Husband.Â  We\r\n  affirm this finding.\r\nHusband and Sister were\r\n  questioned extensively on whether there was any written documentation\r\n  supporting their claim that Sister loaned Husband large sums of money to\r\n  support his business and to fund improvements to the marital home.Â  Neither\r\n  Husband nor Sister could point to any documentation of the alleged loans, and Wife\r\n  testified that Husband never told her about any loans from Sister.Â  The family\r\n  court noted with suspicion the claim that the alleged loans were made in cash. Â It\r\n  also cited Husband's history of conveying title to the marital home to another\r\n  family memberâ€”his motherâ€”during previous marital discord as an indication that\r\n  his conveyance to Sister was, in fact, a further attempt to keep the home out\r\n  of the marital estate.Â  Moreover, no provision was put in place for Husband to\r\n  redeem the property.Â  Â Â \r\nHusband has not carried his\r\n  burden of convincing this Court that the family court erred in regarding the\r\n  alleged loan as a fiction. Â Hence, we defer to the family court's assessment of\r\n  witness credibility on this issue.Â  See Woodall, 322 S.C. at 10,\r\n  471 S.E.2d at 157 (&quot;The trial judge was in a superior position to judge\r\n  the witnesses' demeanor and veracity and, therefore, his findings should be given\r\n  broad discretion.&quot;). Â Â \r\nII. Transmutation\r\nHusband argues that the family court\r\n  erred in characterizing the marital home as marital property.&nbsp; We agree;\r\n  however, we remand the case to the family court for a determination of Wife's entitlement,\r\n  if any, to an equitable interest in the home's increase in value.\r\n&quot;Identification of marital property\r\n  is controlled by the provisions of the Equitable Apportionment of Marital\r\n  Property Act&quot; (the Act).&nbsp; Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289,\r\n  294, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988).&nbsp; The Act defines marital\r\n  property as all real and personal property acquired by the parties during the\r\n  marriage that is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital\r\n  litigation, regardless of how legal title is held. &nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2009). Â Under the Act, property acquired by either party before the\r\n  marriage is nonmarital property. &nbsp;Id. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(2).&nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&quot;The spouse claiming an equitable\r\n  interest in property upon dissolution of the marriage has the burden of proving\r\n  the property is part of the marital estate.&quot; &nbsp;Johnson, 296\r\n  S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110.&nbsp; If a spouse carries this burden, a prima\r\n  facie case is established that the property is marital property.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n  If the opposing spouse then wishes to claim that the property is not part of\r\n  the marital estate, that spouse has the burden of presenting evidence to\r\n  establish its nonmarital character. &nbsp;Id. (citing Miller v.\r\n    Miller, 293 S.C. 69, 71 n.2, 358 S.E.2d 710, 711 n.2 (1987)).&nbsp; If the\r\n  opposing spouse can show that the property was acquired before the marriage or\r\n  falls within a statutory exception, this rebuts the prima facie case for its\r\n  inclusion in the marital estate.&nbsp; Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295, 372\r\n  S.E.2d at 110.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nEven if property is nonmarital, it may\r\n  be transmuted into marital property during the marriage. &nbsp;Id.&nbsp;\r\n  Transmutation occurs if the property is utilized in support of the marriage or\r\n  in such a manner as to evidence an intent to make it marital property. &nbsp;Canady\r\n    v. Canady, 296 S.C. 521, 523-24, 374 S.E.2d 502, 503 (Ct. App. 1988).&nbsp;\r\n  Transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case,\r\n  and the spouse claiming transmutation &quot;must produce objective evidence\r\n  showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property\r\n  as the common property of the marriage.&quot; &nbsp;Johnson, 296 S.C. at\r\n  295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11. \r\nEvidence of intent to transmute\r\n  nonmarital property may include using the property exclusively for marital\r\n  purposes or using marital funds to build equity in the property. &nbsp;Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 111.&nbsp; However, &quot;[t]he mere use of separate\r\n  property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to\r\n  treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish\r\n  transmutation.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111.\r\nHere, Husband\r\n  testified that he started clearing the lot on which he built the marital home\r\n  in 1979 and began construction of the home in 1983.Â  Husband's mother, Dorothy\r\n  Pruitt (Mother), testified that Husband started building the marital home on\r\n  land owned by his grandmother, but that it was not completed when Husband\r\n  married Wife in 1988.Â  Wife's sister also testified that the home was not\r\n  completed when Wife moved into it, and that Wife helped Husband complete the\r\n  construction.Â  However, Mother admitted that the couple were able to live in\r\n  the home when they first married, as it had a bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom,\r\n  and a living room.Â  Â Â \r\nMother\r\n  also testified that she inherited the land on which Husband built the home when\r\n  Husband's grandmother died and that she later conveyed the land to Husband\r\n  after he married Wife.[3]Â \r\n  Sister also testified that Husband's grandmother originally owned the land on\r\n  which the marital home sits and that Mother inherited the property and later\r\n  conveyed it to Husband.Â  Husband conveyed the property back to Mother when he\r\n  suspected Wife was having an affair in 1995, but Mother reconveyed the property\r\n  to Husband a few months later.Â  In May 2006, Husband conveyed the property to\r\n  Sister.Â  \r\nAs to\r\n  Wife's contributions to the marital home's improvements, Mother testified that\r\n  Wife helped with installing fans and adding a carport and another bedroom to\r\n  the home.Â  Wife testified that she helped to hang siding, replace the kitchen\r\n  floor, install glass in the sunroom, paint and install flooring in the master\r\n  bedroom, and build a carport.Â  However, she also testified that she did not\r\n  know where the money to pay for the materials came from and that Husband &quot;always\r\n  seemed to have cash on him.&quot;Â  Notably, Husband denied that the cash used\r\n  to pay for the improvements came from marital funds but rather claimed that the\r\n  cash came from Sister (see Issue I discussed above).Â  In any event, Wife did\r\n  not carry her burden of showing that the improvements to the home were paid for\r\n  with marital funds.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, Wife failed to carry her\r\n  burden of producing objective evidence showing that Husband regarded the home\r\n  as the common property of the marriage, which is essential for a transmutation\r\n  claim.Â  This case is similar to Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 157-58, 439 S.E.2d 312, 315&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1993).Â  In Murray, the parties\r\n  had lived in the marital home for the duration of their seventeen-year\r\n  marriage, and wife had worked on improvements to the marital home during that\r\n  time.Â  Id.Â  This Court stated the following:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    parties lived in the marital home for the duration of the marriage. Although\r\n    this was Mrs. Murray's home for over seventeen years, the mere use of separate\r\n    property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to\r\n    treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish\r\n    transmutation. \r\n  Mrs. Murray contends her\r\n    contributions of labor and time to the improvement and maintenance of the\r\n    marital home and rental properties are evidence that the parties considered the\r\n    properties were marital property [sic]. While improvements made by a spouse to\r\n    nonmarital property may result in the spouse's receiving an equitable interest\r\n    in the property, contributions of time and labor do not necessarily prove\r\n    transmutation. In this case, Mr. Murray paid for all of the properties prior to\r\n    marriage. Mrs. Murray failed to produce evidence that any appreciable amount of\r\n    marital funds was expended on improvement of the properties. \r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).Â  Here, similar to the wife in Murray,\r\n  Wife lived in and worked on improvements to the marital home during her nineteen-year\r\n  marriage to Husband.Â  However, the record does not reflect that marital funds\r\n  paid for the materials used to improve the home.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  there is nothing in the record to show the value of Wife's contributions\r\n  or how those contributions affected the value of the home.Â  Section 20-3-630(A)(5) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009)\r\n  allows a spouse a special equity in the increase in value of nonmarital\r\n  property when the spouse contributes directly or indirectly to the increase.Â  On\r\n  more than one occasion, South Carolina appellate courts have remanded a case to\r\n  the family court with instructions to determine the value of a spouse's\r\n  contributions to the increase in value of nonmarital property.Â  See Anderson\r\n    v. Anderson, 282 S.C. 162, 164, 318 S.E.2d 566, 567 (1984) (&quot;On remand, the court shall make factual findings regarding\r\n  the parties' relative contributions to the improvements.&quot;); Craig v. Craig, 358\r\n  S.C. 548, 559-60, 595 S.E.2d 837, 844&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2004)&nbsp;(&quot;We\r\n  remand this issue to the trial court to properly consider the full extent of\r\n  Wife's contributions, the full\r\n  amount of marital funds employed, and any increase in the value of the property\r\n  resulting directly from the contributions of Wife.&quot;); Webber v.\r\n    Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 428, 330 S.E.2d 79, 81 (Ct. App. 1985) (&quot;[W]e remand for a determination of the extent of Mrs. Webber's\r\n  contribution to the renovation.&quot;).Â  Therefore, we remand this case\r\n  to the family court to determine any appreciation of the marital home's value\r\n  resulting from Wife's contributions and to reapportion the marital estate.\r\nIII. Marital\r\n  Debts\r\nHusband contends that the family\r\n  court failed to consider all of the marital debts in determining the net value\r\n  of the marital estate.Â  We agree as to three particular debts but disagree as\r\n  to remaining debts listed by Husband.Â  The $35,000 loan balance on Husband's\r\n  truck, the $1,092 debt to the IRS, and the $356 debt to Husband's accountant\r\n  should have been deducted from the value assigned to the marital estate because\r\n  they were supported by the evidence as legitimate business debts.\r\n&quot;Marital\r\n  debt, like marital property, must be specifically identified and apportioned in\r\n  equitable distribution.&quot; Â Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532,\r\n  546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105&nbsp;(2005).Â  Section 20-3-620 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2009) creates a rebuttable presumption\r\n  that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is a marital debt\r\n  and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.Â  Id. Â Section\r\n  20-3-620 states, in pertinent part, the following:\r\n\r\n  Â  (B) In making [a final equitable] apportionment\r\n    [of the parties' marital property], the court must give weight in such\r\n      proportion as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors:\r\n  . . . \r\n  (13) liens and any other encumbrances\r\n    upon the marital property, which themselves must be equitably divided, or upon\r\n    the separate property of either of the parties, and any other existing debts\r\n    incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-620(B)(13) (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).\r\n&quot;For purposes of\r\n  equitable distribution, 'marital debt' is debt incurred for the joint benefit of\r\n  the parties regardless of whether the parties are legally jointly liable for the debt or whether one party is legally\r\n  individually liable.&quot;Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436-37, 429\r\n  S.E.2d 811, 813&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1993).Â  &quot;In\r\n  the equitable division of a marital estate, the estate which is to be equitably\r\n  divided by the family court judge is the net estate, i.e., provision for the\r\n  payment of marital debts must be apportioned as well as the apportionment of\r\n  property itself.&quot;Â  Id. at 437, 429 S.E.2d at 813. Â &quot;[B]asically the same\r\n  rules of fairness and equity [that] apply to the equitable division of marital\r\n  property also apply to the division of marital debts.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  437, 429 S.E.2d at 814.\r\nWhen\r\n  the debt is incurred before marital litigation begins, the burden of proving a\r\n  spouse's debt is non-marital rests on the party making that assertion. Â Wooten, 364\r\n  S.C. at 547, 615 S.E.2d at 105.Â  When\r\n  a debt is incurred after the commencement of litigation but before the final\r\n  divorce decree, the family court may equitably apportion it as a marital debt\r\n  when it is shown the debt was incurred for the joint benefit of the parties\r\n  during the marriage.Â  Id. Â Under these circumstances, the burden of\r\n  proving the debt is marital rests on the party making that assertion. Â Id.\r\nIf the family court\r\n  finds that a spouse's debt was not made for marital purposes, it need not be\r\n  factored in the court's equitable apportionment of the marital estate and the family\r\n  court may require payment by the spouse who created the debt for non-marital\r\n  purposes.Â  Hardy, at\r\n  437, 429 S.E.2d at 814.Â  &quot;[T]he words 'in such proportion as it finds appropriate,'\r\n  as used in section [20-3-620] accord much discretion to the trial judge in\r\n  providing for the payment of marital debts as a consideration in the equitable\r\n  division of the marital estate.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHere, the only debts that\r\n  the family court addressed in its initial order were the alleged loan from\r\n  Sister, which it rejected, the parties' medical bills, and the Dixie Federal\r\n  Line of Credit.Â  In its order on Husband's motion for reconsideration, the family\r\n  court generally addressed the debts listed in Husband's motion.Â  The court\r\n  indicated that, with the exception of those debts already deducted from the\r\n  marital assets, the debts listed in Husband's motion did not qualify as debts\r\n  incurred for the joint benefit of the parties.[4]\r\nSome of the debts Husband\r\n  contends were overlooked by the family court are debts of his business, Scott's\r\n  Collision Center.Â  The value the family court assigned to the business was\r\n  based on the entry of &quot;Total Assets&quot; in the business' 2006 federal\r\n  corporate income tax return.Â  However, the debts of the business were not\r\n  reflected in that entry and thus the entry was not an accurate indicator of the\r\n  net value of the business.Â  A tax worksheet drafted by Husband's accountant\r\n  while preparing the business' 2006 tax return lists business assets and\r\n  includes a 2006 Chevrolet truck valued at $39,704. Â Husband testified that he\r\n  owed $35,000 on the truck.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nHusband also testified about\r\n  the following debts that were listed in his financial declaration and motion\r\n  for reconsideration and documented in Defendant's Exhibit 16:Â  Webster Rogers accounting\r\n  firm ($356) and IRS ($1,092).Â  These are well-documented business debts that\r\n  should have been deducted from the value of the marital assets.Â Â  \r\nTurning to Husband's\r\n  testimony about money he owed his paramour for her purchase of home furnishings\r\n  for him, he admits that this &quot;debt&quot; was incurred after the filing of\r\n  marital litigation.Â  However, he contends that the debt should be deducted from\r\n  the marital assets because Wife took all of the furnishings from the marital\r\n  home when she vacated it and this alleged wrongdoing required Husband to purchase\r\n  new furnishings with the financial assistance of his paramour.Â  The family\r\n  court acted well within its discretion in disregarding the debt to this\r\n  particular &quot;creditor,&quot; as it was not incurred for the joint benefit\r\n  of both parties.Â  In fact, it was an expenditure naturally associated with the\r\n  parties going their separate ways.Â  Â Â \r\nRegarding the alleged debts\r\n  listed by Husband that were not adequately explained by his testimony at trial,\r\n  we defer to the family court's finding that these debts do not qualify as debts\r\n  incurred for the joint benefit of the parties.Â  See Woodall,\r\n  322 S.C. at 10, 471 S.E.2d at 157 (holding that because the family court was in\r\n  a superior position to judge the witnesses' demeanor and veracity, its findings\r\n  should be given broad deference).Â Â  \r\nIV. Valuation\r\n  of marital assets\r\nHusband challenges the family\r\n  court's valuation of the parties' assets.Â  We agree as to certain assets that\r\n  were counted twice in the family court's list of marital assets but disagree\r\n  with Husband's remaining assertions on asset valuation.\r\nInitially, Wife\r\n  argues that Husband did not preserve this issue for appeal as to the values for\r\n  the real estate because Husband agreed to these values at trial.Â  We agree.Â  In\r\n  fact, Husband indicates in his brief that he submitted Joint Exhibit 1, which\r\n  is an appraisal of the parties' marital home and the land and buildings for\r\n  Husband's business.Â  However, Husband asserts that the costs of converting the\r\n  marital real estate to cash should have been deducted from the values assigned\r\n  to these properties so that Husband would have liquid funds to pay to Wife for\r\n  her share of the marital estate, as ordered by the family court.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Husband argues that he is entitled to a deduction for the realty commissions\r\n  and any necessary loan costs.[5]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  Because the family court's order does not contemplate the sale of\r\n  either the marital home or the real property associated with Husband's business,\r\n  it would be inappropriate to deduct any estimated costs of converting the real\r\n  estate to cash.Â  Cf. Bowers v. Bowers,\r\n  349 S.C. 85, 97-98, 561 S.E.2d 610, 617&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2002)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that when an order of equitable apportionment does not contemplate the\r\n  liquidation or sale of an asset, it is an abuse of discretion for the court to\r\n  consider the tax consequences from a supposed sale or liquidation).\r\nConcerning the personal\r\n  property, Husband argues that two vehiclesâ€”the Chevy Sierra and the 2000 Chevy\r\n  Vanâ€”should not have been included in the marital estate because he did not own\r\n  them at the time that marital litigation was filed.Â  We disagree.Â  Husband\r\n  testified that he did not sell the Chevy Sierra until two months prior to\r\n  trial, after marital litigation was filed.Â  Further, the record does not\r\n  reflect the date when Husband purchased the Chevy Sierra.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  testimony does not support Husband's assertion that he did not own the Chevy\r\n  Van when marital litigation was filed.Â  Husband's testimony does not address\r\n  the length of his ownership of the vehicle.Â  Husband simply testified that he\r\n  owned it, that he purchased it for $500, and that it was worth $2,500 after he\r\n  made repairs to it. Â Therefore, Husband has not carried his burden of\r\n  convincing this Court that the family court erred by including these assets in\r\n  the marital estate. Â See Duckett by Duckett v. Payne, 279 S.C. 94, 96, 302 S.E.2d 342, 343&nbsp;(1983) (&quot;[T]he appellant carries the burden of convincing this Court that\r\n  the trial court erred.&quot;).\r\nAs to the assets\r\n  that were counted twice, the asset schedule for the 2006 corporate tax return\r\n  shows that the value of the GMC Sierra had already been included in the value\r\n  of Husband's business, which was added as item 3 in the family court's list of\r\n  marital assets.Â  Husband's proposed list of marital assets in his brief omits\r\n  the value assigned to the business, which the family court took from the\r\n  &quot;Total Assets&quot; entry on Husband's tax return, and instead lists\r\n  certain business assets individually.Â  This approach is justified in part\r\n  because certain business assets accounted for in item 3 of the family court's\r\n  list also had individual entries in the same list and thus the following assets\r\n  were counted twice: GMC Sierra (items 3 and 12 in the family court's list) and\r\n  the business' buildings (items 2 and 3).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nHusband also\r\n  asserts that the family court assigned inaccurate values to the parties' Darlington\r\n  County bank account, their savings bonds and their boat.Â  However, he does not\r\n  explain why he believes these values are incorrect.Â  Therefore, he has\r\n  abandoned this argument as to these assets.Â  See Glasscock, 348 S.C. at 81, 557 S.E.2d at\r\n  691&nbsp;(&quot;[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting\r\n  authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for\r\n  review.&quot;).\r\nHusband also\r\n  argues that the drag racers housed at his business should not have been\r\n  included in the marital estate because he did not own them.Â  Husband contested\r\n  his ownership of these vehicles at trial, and the family court did not find him\r\n  to be credible on this issue.Â  We defer to the family court's determination of\r\n  credibility on this issue.Â  See Woodall, 322\r\n  S.C. at 10, 471 S.E.2d at 157 (requiring broad deference to be given to the family\r\n  court's findings because the family court was in a superior position to judge\r\n  the witnesses' demeanor and veracity).Â Â  \r\nV. Husband's Adultery\r\nHusband argues that\r\n  the family court erred in finding that his adultery was the sole reason for the\r\n  breakup of the marriage and thus Wife was entitled to a greater percentage of\r\n  the marital assets.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe apportionment of marital property is\r\n  within the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. &nbsp;Morris\r\n    v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525, 531, 517 S.E.2d 720, 723&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon\r\n  dissolution of the marriage, marital property should be divided and distributed\r\n  in a manner [that] fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to its\r\n  acquisition, regardless of who holds legal title.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n  The ultimate goal of apportionment is to divide the marital estate, as a whole,\r\n  in a manner that fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to the economic\r\n  partnership and also the effect on each of the parties of ending that\r\n  partnership.&nbsp; Johnson, 296 S.C. at 298, 372 S.E.2d at 112. Â Section 20-3-620(B)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) provides that the family court must\r\n  consider fifteen factors in apportioning the marital estate and give each\r\n  factor its proper weight.[6]&nbsp; These\r\n  criteria are intended to guide the family court in exercising its discretion\r\n  over apportionment of marital property.&nbsp; Johnson, 296 S.C.\r\n  at 297-98, 372 S.E.2d at 112.&nbsp; The family court has the discretion to\r\n  decide what weight to assign various factors.&nbsp; Greene v. Greene,\r\n  351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; The factors\r\n  were meant to provide merely guidance in reaching a fair distribution of\r\n  marital property. &nbsp;Johnson, 296 S.C. at 297-98, 372 S.E.2d\r\n  at 112.Â  On\r\n  review, this Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if\r\n  the end result is equitable, the fact that this Court might have weighed\r\n  specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant. &nbsp;Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113.\r\nHere, to the extent that the family\r\n  court considered marital fault in the division of marital assets, the record\r\n  supports the family court's findings that Husband's adultery caused the breakup\r\n  of the marriage and that Wife's adultery did not occur until December 2007,\r\n  after Wife filed the complaint and the parties had separated.Â  Husband admitted\r\n  that he committed adultery, and Wife testified that Husband refused to give up\r\n  his relationship with his paramour after she requested him to do so.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nFurther, the family court indicated in\r\n  its order that it based the division of assets on several factors,\r\n  including the following:Â  marital fault; Wife's indirect contributions to the\r\n  marriage; the fact that Wife did not have any significant nonmarital assets; and\r\n  Wife's limited income, earning capacity, and opportunity to acquire other property.Â \r\n  Therefore, the family court's division of property was not based solely on\r\n  marital fault.Â  In any event, we believe that the family court's emphasis on\r\n  the foregoing factors was appropriate.\r\nNonetheless, because we are reversing\r\n  the family court's conclusion that the marital home was transmuted and remanding\r\n  the case for a determination of any special equity Wife may have in the marital\r\n  home's improvements, reconsideration of the division of the marital estate is in\r\n  order.Â Â Â  \r\nVI. Gifts from Husband's Family\r\nHusband contends that\r\n  the family court erred in neglecting to order Wife to return those household\r\n  items given to Husband as gifts from members of his family.Â  Wife concedes in\r\n  her brief that she should return any household items given to Husband by\r\n  members of his family, but argues that he should have to provide\r\n  &quot;sufficient evidence&quot; that the specific items claimed are in fact\r\n  gifts to him from his family.Â  We remand this issue to the family court with\r\n  instructions to unconditionally order Wife to return to Husband all household\r\n  items given to him by members of his family. Â Should the parties disagree on\r\n  which items should be returned, Husband has the option of presenting evidence\r\n  of ownership in proceedings to enforce the order.Â  \r\nVII. Temporary Alimony\r\nHusband asserts that\r\n  the family court should have given him credit for all of the temporary alimony\r\n  paid to Wife because her adultery barred her from receiving alimony pursuant to\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. 2009).Â  We disagree.\r\nIn his motion for\r\n  reconsideration, Husband sought a credit for the temporary alimony paid to Wife\r\n  on the ground that the family court found in its initial order that Wife had\r\n  committed adultery during the pendency of this action.Â  The family court\r\n  granted Husband's motion, but only to the extent that Wife was barred from\r\n  receiving alimony prospectively.Â  Because the family court found that Wife did\r\n  not commit adultery until December 2007, it granted Husband a credit only for\r\n  alimony paid after December 2007.\r\nSection 20-3-130(A)\r\n  states:\r\n\r\n  No alimony may be awarded a spouse who commits adultery before the\r\n    earliest of these two events: (1) the formal signing of a written property or\r\n    marital settlement agreement or (2) entry of a permanent order of separate\r\n    maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital\r\n    settlement agreement between the parties.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A) (Supp. 2009).Â  In other words, section 20-3-130(A) allows\r\n  alimony to a spouse only if his or her adultery post-dates the &quot;formal\r\n  signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement;&quot; the entry\r\n  of a &quot;permanent order of separate maintenance and support;&quot; or the\r\n  entry of a &quot;permanent order approving a property or marital settlement\r\n  agreement between the parties.&quot;\r\nHere,\r\n  there exists no written property or marital settlement agreement.Â  Rather, the\r\n  parties merely placed on the record an oral agreement regarding temporary\r\n  relief, and the family court incorporated the oral agreement into its consent\r\n  order granting temporary relief.Â  Further, there exists neither a permanent\r\n  order of separate maintenance and support nor a permanent order approving a\r\n  property or marital settlement agreement between the parties.Â  Hence, Wife's\r\n  adultery cannot be said to have post-dated any of the qualifying events listed\r\n  in section 20-3-130(A).Â  Therefore, she was barred from receiving alimony.Â  The\r\n  dispute lies in determining whether the bar is retroactive to the first\r\n  temporary alimony payment, which was made by Husband before Wife committed\r\n  adultery, or merely to the first payment to occur after Wife's adultery.Â  \r\nPrior to 1990, the statute's bar\r\n  for an adulterous spouse from receiving alimony was absolute.Â  In 1990, the legislature amended section 20-3-130\r\n  to add the language regarding the commission of adultery before one of two\r\n  events. Â Act No. 518, 1990 S.C. Acts 2255. Â South Carolina jurisprudence pre-dating the current version of the alimony statute remain\r\n  instructive in determining an appropriate disposition in the present case.Â  In Morris\r\n    v. Morris, our Supreme Court terminated alimony retroactively merely to the\r\n  date of the divorce decree rather than to the very first alimony payment. Â 295\r\n  S.C. 37, 41, 367 S.E.2d 24, 26&nbsp;(1988).Â  However, unlike the Supreme Court's\r\n  approach in Morris, in Watson v. Watson, this Court required a credit\r\n  against the wife's equitable distribution award for all alimony paid because\r\n  the wife's adultery pre-dated the temporary alimony award.Â  291 S.C. 13, 22-24,\r\n  351 S.E.2d 883, 889-90 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Morris is distinguishable from Watson in that the wife in Morris did not commit adultery until after a decree\r\n  of separate maintenance was filed.Â  295 S.C. at 40-41, 367 S.E.2d at 26.&nbsp; Notably,\r\n  that decree was a permanent decree in the wife's action for separate\r\n  maintenance and support and pre-dated Husband's divorce action.Â  Morris,\r\n  295 S.C. at 40, 367 S.E.2d at 25.&nbsp; Â Â \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we believe that the family court acted within its discretion\r\n  in allowing Husband a credit for temporary alimony payments made after Wife's\r\n  act of adultery in December 2007.Â  Â \r\nVIII. Attorney's Fees\r\nHusband argues that\r\n  the family court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees in the\r\n  amount of $10,000 to Wife.Â  Because we remand the case on the property division\r\n  issues discussed above, the family court must reconsider attorney's fees in\r\n  light of this Court's opinion.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501,\r\n  503-04, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993) (reversing and\r\n  remanding issue of attorney's fees for reconsideration when the substantive\r\n  results achieved by trial counsel were reversed on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family courtâ€™s findings\r\n  that Sister did not loan $40,000 to Husband and that Husband's adultery was the\r\n  sole reason for the breakup of the marriage.Â  We also affirm the family court's\r\n  ruling that Husband receive a credit for temporary alimony paid after December\r\n  2007.Â  We reverse the conclusion that the marital home was transmuted into\r\n  marital property but remand for a determination of any special equity Wife may\r\n  have in the marital home's improvements and reconsideration of the division of\r\n  the marital estate and the attorney's fees award.Â  \r\nWe direct the family court to\r\n  correct the list of marital assets so that the GMC Sierra and the buildings of\r\n  the Husband's business are no longer counted twice.Â  We further direct the\r\n  family court to deduct the following debts from the value assigned to the marital\r\n  estate:Â  (1) the $35,000 loan balance on Husband's truck; (2) the $1,092 debt\r\n  to the IRS; and (3) the $356 debt to Husband's accountant.Â  Finally, we direct\r\n  the family court to order Wife to return to Husband all household items that\r\n  were gifts from members of his family.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\r\nCURETON and\r\n  GOOLSBY, A.JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For the sake of\r\n  brevity only, we will refer to the home in which\r\n  Husband and Wife lived as the marital home.Â  This reference is not a conclusion that the home is marital property subject\r\n  to equitable distribution. \r\n[2] The family court\r\n  had found in its initial order that Wife had sexual relations with a former\r\n  boyfriend in December 2007 and thus committed adultery.Â  \r\n[3] Even though\r\n  Mother's conveyance of land to Husband occurred after he married Wife, property\r\n  acquired by either party by gift from a party other than the spouse is\r\n  nonmarital property.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1) (Supp. 2009); see also Smith v. Smith, 294\r\n  S.C. 194, 199, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1987) (&quot;[G]ifts\r\n  made by a third party to one spouse alone . . . do not ordinarily constitute\r\n  marital property and therefore should not be included in the marital\r\n  estate.&quot;).\r\n[4] The order on\r\n  the motion for reconsideration states:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    debts the Defendant now contends were omitted in paragraph 12 of his motion\r\n    make no sense at all.Â  The Court does not recall the testimony with respect to\r\n    them at the trial.Â  However, the substantial ones are for the purchase of\r\n    assets no part of which are reflected in the division of the property nor do\r\n    they appear on the schedule attached to the motion as assets of the business.Â \r\n    Eq. [sic] Software, trailer, truck.Â  Nor did the tax return show any interest\r\n    paid by the business.Â  If that money is in fact owed, it would be owed by the\r\n    business and those assets which were bought would surely have showed [sic] on\r\n    the schedule of business assets attached to the motion as it seems would [sic]\r\n    have been accounts receivable and inventory.Â  The motion exhibit is not\r\n    convincing of any mistake in the order.\r\n\r\n[5] Husband's\r\n  request for a deduction for loan costs was raised for the first time in his\r\n  reply brief.Â  Therefore, the Court may not consider this argument.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 692&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2001) (&quot;[A]n argument made in a reply brief cannot\r\n  present an issue to the appellate court if it was not addressed in the initial\r\n  brief.&quot;).\r\n[6] Section\r\n  20-3-620 lists the fifteen factors the family court must consider as:Â  (1) the\r\n  duration of the marriage along with the ages of the parties at the time of the\r\n  marriage and at the time of the divorce; (2) marital misconduct or fault of\r\n  either or both parties, if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic\r\n  circumstances of the parties or contributed to the breakup of the marriage; (3)\r\n  the value of the marital property and the contribution of each spouse to the\r\n  acquisition, preservation, depreciation, or appreciation in value of the\r\n  marital property, including the contribution of the spouse as homemaker; (4)\r\n  the income of each spouse, the earning potential of each spouse, and the\r\n  opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets; (5) the health, both\r\n  physical and emotional, of each spouse; (6) either spouse's need for additional\r\n  training or education in order to achieve that spouse's income potential; (7)\r\n  the nonmarital property of each spouse; (8) the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  vested retirement benefits for either spouse; (9) whether separate maintenance\r\n  or alimony has been awarded; (10) the desirability of awarding the family home\r\n  as part of equitable distribution or the right to live in it for reasonable\r\n  periods to the spouse having custody of any children; (11) the tax consequences\r\n  to either party as a result of equitable apportionment; (12) the existence and\r\n  extent of any prior support obligations; (13) liens and any other encumbrances\r\n  on the marital property and any other existing debts; (14) child custody\r\n  arrangements and obligations at the time of the entry of the order; and (15)\r\n  any other relevant factors that the family court expressly enumerates in its\r\n  order.&nbsp; S.C.

That section provides:\r\n\r\n  The review of the administrative law judge's order\r\n    must be confined to the record. The court may not substitute its judgment for\r\n    the judgment of the administrative law judge as to the weight of the evidence\r\n    on questions of fact. The court of appeals may affirm the decision or remand\r\n    the case for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if\r\n    the substantive rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the\r\n    finding, conclusion, or decision is:\r\n  (a) in violation of constitutional or\r\n    statutory provisions;\r\n  (b) in excess of the statutory\r\n    authority of the agency;\r\n  (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n  (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n  (e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n    reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n  (f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n    characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n    discretion.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Department\r\n  contends the ALC erred in failing to uphold McGee's suspension pursuant to\r\n  section 56-10-530.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of\r\n  statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  Legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n  (2000).Â  The court will give words their plain and ordinary meaning and will\r\n  not resort to a subtle or forced construction that would limit or expand the\r\n  statute's operation.Â Â  Harris v. Anderson County Sheriff's Office, 381\r\n  S.C. 357, 362, 673 S.E.2d 423, 425&nbsp;(2009).Â  &quot;A statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and\r\n  fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design,\r\n  and policy of the lawmakers.&quot;Â  New York Times Co. v. Spartanburg County\r\n    School Dist. No. 7, 374 S.C. 307, 310-311, 649 S.E.2d 28, 30&nbsp;(2007) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  In interpreting a statute, the language of the statute must be read\r\n  in a sense that harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general\r\n  purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Systems Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178,\r\n  420 S.E.2d 843, 846&nbsp;(1992).\r\nSection 56-10-530 provides\r\n  in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  When it\r\n    appears to the director from the records of his office that an uninsured motor\r\n    vehicle as defined in Section 56-9-20, subject to registration in the State, is\r\n    involved in a reportable accident in the State resulting in death, injury, or\r\n    property damage with respect to which motor vehicle the owner thereof has not\r\n    paid the uninsured motor vehicle fee as prescribed in Section 56-10-510, the\r\n    director shall, in addition to enforcing the applicable provisions of Section\r\n    56-10-10, et seq. of this chapter, suspend such owner's driver's license and\r\n    all of his license plates and registration certificates until such person has\r\n    complied with those provisions of law and has paid to the director of the\r\n    Department of Motor Vehicles a reinstatement fee as provided by Section\r\n    56-10-510, to be disposed of as provided by Section 56-10-550, with respect to\r\n    the motor vehicle involved in the accident and furnishes proof of future\r\n    financial responsibility in the manner prescribed in Section 56-9-350, et seq.\r\n    However, no order of suspension required by this section must become effective\r\n    until the director has offered the person an opportunity for a contested case\r\n    hearing before the Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings to show cause why the order\r\n    should not be enforced. Notice of the opportunity for a contested case hearing\r\n    must be included in the order of suspension. Notice of such suspension shall be\r\n    made in the form provided for in Section 56-1-465. \r\n\r\nThe Department's records\r\n  reflect McGee's truck was a registered and plated uninsured motor vehicle that\r\n  was involved in an accident resulting in property damage.Â  However, McGee\r\n  argues he did not intend to operate or permit operation of the truck; and,\r\n  therefore the uninsured motor vehicle fee statute is not applicable.\r\nSection 56-10-510 states, in\r\n  pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    addition to any other fees prescribed by law, every person registering an\r\n    uninsured motor vehicle, as defined in Section 56-9-20, at the time of\r\n    registering or reregistering the uninsured vehicle, shall pay a fee of five\r\n    hundred and fifty dollars. . . .The application for registering an uninsured\r\n    vehicle must have the following statements printed on or attached to the first\r\n    page of the form, boldface, twelve point type: &quot;THIS $550 FEE IS NOT AN\r\n    INSURANCE PREMIUM AND YOU ARE NOT PURCHASING ANY INSURANCE BY PAYING THIS FEE.Â \r\n    THIS $550 UNINSURED MOTORIST FEE IS FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO DRIVE AND OPERATE AN\r\n    UNINSURED MOTOR VEHICLE ON THE SOUTH CAROLINA ROADS.&quot;Â  \r\n  (emphasis\r\n    in original).\r\n\r\nSection 56-10-510 suggests\r\n  the uninsured motor vehicle fee only applies to an owner who operates an\r\n  uninsured motor vehicle on South Carolina roads.Â  However, we conclude a plain\r\n  reading of the statute would effectuate an absurd result because this State\r\n  requires either insurance coverage or payment of the uninsured motor vehicle\r\n  fee for all registered motor vehicles.\r\nIn Shores v. Weaver,\r\n  315 S.C. 347, 352, 433 S.E.2d 913, 915 (Ct. App. 1993) this court stated,\r\n  &quot;[The General Assembly] decided that all vehicles registered and licensed\r\n  in this State must be insured to the minimal coverage and limits required by\r\n  the Motor Vehicle Financial\r\n  Responsibility Act.&quot;[3] Thus, under Shores, South Carolina required mandatory liability\r\n  insurance for registered and licensed motor vehicles.\r\nIn Cowan v. Allstate Ins.\r\n  Co., 351 S.C. 626, 632-33, 571 S.E.2d 715, 718&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002), this\r\n  court found section 56-10-510 superseded Shores. As a result, South\r\n  Carolina is no longer a mandatory insurance state because section 56-10-510\r\n  allows a person to pay an uninsured motor vehicle fee when registering with the\r\n  Department of Motor Vehicles.[4]\r\nMcGee's argument would\r\n  discourage similarly-situated individuals from obtaining liability insurance or\r\n  paying the uninsured motor vehicle fee while simultaneously owning a registered\r\n  and plated uninsured motor vehicle.Â  We believe this result contravenes\r\n  legislative intent because South Carolina requires liability insurance, or in\r\n  the alternative, payment of the uninsured motor vehicle fee for a registered\r\n  motor vehicle.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-10 (2006) (stating every\r\n  owner of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this State shall maintain\r\n  the security required by Section 56-10-20 throughout the effective registration\r\n  period); Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-20 (2006) (generally stating the security under\r\n  this chapter must be for at least the minimum coverages and the director may\r\n  approve and accept another form of security in lieu of such a liability\r\n  insurance policy if he finds that such other form of security is adequate to\r\n  provide and does in fact provide the benefits required by this chapter); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-510 (stating every person registering or reregistering an\r\n  uninsured motor vehicle shall pay an uninsured motor vehicle fee of five\r\n  hundred and fifty dollars).Â  Moreover, pursuant to section 56-10-240(A) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) McGee was obligated to surrender his license\r\n  plate and registration to the Department after the truck became uninsured.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-240(A) (stating a motor vehicle owner shall immediately\r\n  obtain insurance or surrender his license plate and registration certificate\r\n  within five days after the effective date of cancellation or expiration of\r\n  liability insurance if the motor vehicle is or becomes an uninsured motor\r\n  vehicle during the period for which it is licensed).\r\nTherefore, we conclude an\r\n  owner who fails to pay the uninsured motor vehicle fee while maintaining a\r\n  registered and licensed uninsured motor vehicle is subject to suspension\r\n  pursuant to section 56-10-530.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  Administrative law court's decision is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 56-10-530 authorizes the Department to\r\n  suspend an owner's driver's license and all of his license plates and registration\r\n  certificates if the Department's records reflect that the owner's uninsured\r\n  motor vehicle is involved in a reportable accident resulting in death, injury,\r\n  or property damage and the uninsured motor vehicle fee is not paid.\r\n[2] Section 56-10-510 provides at the time of\r\n  registration or reregistration an uninsured motor vehicle, every person must\r\n  pay an uninsured motor vehicle fee of $550.\r\n[3] Shores was superseded by statute as stated in Cowan, 351 S.C. 626,\r\n  571 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n[4]Â  Our Supreme Court subsequently reversed the\r\n  Court of Appeals' decision in Cowan and concluded section 38-77-142(B) did not impact the holding of Shores.Â  See Cowan v. Allstate Ins. Co.,&nbsp;357\r\n  S.C. 625, 594 S.E.2d 275&nbsp;(2004).Â  Despite our Supreme Court's reversal,\r\n  the Court of Appeals' statement regarding the transformation of South Carolina\r\n  from a mandatory insurance state to a non-mandatory insurance state is a\r\n  correct pronouncement of the law.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4721","title":"Rutland v.

Christopher Wilson, of Bamberg; Lee D. Cope, R. Alexander\r\n          Murdaugh, Matthew V. Creech, of Hampton, for Appellant.\r\n        Richard B. Ness and Norma A. T. Jett, of Bamberg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Clarence\r\n  Rutland (Rutland), as personal representative of the Estate of Tiffanie\r\n  Rutland, appeals the trial court's decision granting the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Transportation's (SCDOT) post-trial motion for set-off, which\r\n  subsequently reduced the verdict against SCDOT to zero.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 7, 2003, Tiffanie\r\n  Rutland (the decedent) was a passenger in a 1999 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer (the\r\n  Blazer) on Highway 301 in Orangeburg County along with her husband, Rutland,\r\n  her son, and Rutland's aunt.Â  Rutland's uncle, Joseph Bishop (Bishop), was\r\n  driving the Blazer.Â  While traveling on Highway 301, Bishop encountered a heavy\r\n  rain storm and reduced his speed to approximately 45-50 miles per hour.Â \r\n  However, Bishop subsequently lost control of the Blazer when it hydroplaned.Â \r\n  The Blazer overturned in a nearby ditch.Â  The decedent sustained fatal injuries\r\n  after she was partially ejected from the Blazer's side window.Â  \r\nRutland received a $30,000\r\n  settlement from Bishop's automobile insurance policy.Â  On February 2, 2005,\r\n  Rutland filed a wrongful death action against SCDOT.Â  On May 8, 2006, Rutland\r\n  amended his complaint and added REA Construction Company[1] and General Motors (GM) as defendants to the wrongful death action.Â  \r\nPrior to the trial against\r\n  SCDOT, GM and Rutland reached a settlement agreement.Â  The settlement agreement\r\n  totaled $275,000, of which GM agreed to allocate $137,500 to the wrongful death\r\n  claim and $137,500 to the survival claim.Â  The trial court approved the\r\n  settlement agreement (the settlement trial court) on August 9, 2007, and\r\n  allocated $167,000 ($29,500 from Bishop's automobile policy and $137,500 from\r\n  the GM settlement) to the wrongful death claim and $138,000 to a survival\r\n  claim.[2]Â \r\n  The Bishop and GM settlements totaled $305,000.Â  \r\nIn the trial against SCDOT,\r\n  the jury awarded Rutland a $300,000 verdict in actual damages for the\r\n  decedent's wrongful death.Â  SCDOT subsequently filed a motion to set-off the\r\n  proceeds of the Bishop and GM settlements.Â  Rutland filed a motion for a new trial\r\n  absolute, new trial on damages only, or in the alternative for a new trial nisi\r\n    additur.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court that heard the case against SCDOT (the SCDOT trial court) issued an\r\n  order approving SCDOT's motion for set-off, reduced the verdict against SCDOT to\r\n  zero, and denied Rutland's new trial motions.Â  Rutland subsequently filed a\r\n  motion for reconsideration of the SCDOT's trial court order.Â  In the SCDOT\r\n  trial court's final order, the trial court denied Rutland's new trial motions\r\n  and clarified its set-off ruling.Â  The SCDOT trial court concluded the\r\n  settlement agreement should be reallocated based on the insufficiency of the\r\n  evidence to support a survival claim.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  trial court's jurisdiction to set off one judgment against another is equitable\r\n  in nature and should be exercised when necessary to provide justice between the\r\n  parties. Welch v. Epstein,&nbsp;342 S.C. 279, 313, 536 S.E.2d 408,\r\n  425&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  A set-off is not necessarily founded upon any\r\n  statute or fixed rule of court but grows out of the inherent equitable\r\n  jurisdiction of the court.Â  Rookard v. Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line Ry.,\r\n  89 S.C. 371, 376, 71 S.E. 992, 995 (1911).Â  Therefore, a motion for set-off is\r\n  addressed to the discretion of the court, and this discretion should not be\r\n  arbitrarily or capriciously exercised.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Survival Action\r\nRutland contends the SCDOT trial court erred in\r\n  granting SCDOT's motion for set-off because there is sufficient evidence to\r\n  support a survival claim.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe test of a survival action\r\n  in South Carolina is whether the decedent suffered conscious pain and\r\n  suffering.Â  Camp v. Petroleum Carrier Corp., 204 S.C. 133, 139, 28\r\n  S.E.2d 683, 685 (1944).Â  South Carolina case law provides illustrative examples\r\n  of when a survival action has evidentiary support of conscious pain and\r\n  suffering. \r\nIn Ward v. Epting, 290\r\n  S.C. 547, 560, 351 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 1986), this court found testimony\r\n  that the decedent's response to directions in the recovery room following\r\n  surgery constituted sufficient evidence of conscious pain and suffering to\r\n  present a factual question to the jury.Â  In contrast, in Welch v. Epstein,\r\n  this court concluded there was only evidence the decedent lapsed into a coma at\r\n  the time of his arrest and he did not recover from this condition.Â  342 S.C. at\r\n  313, 536 S.E.2d at 426.Â  This court found the survival action was limited\r\n  solely to medical bills, and Ward was distinguishable because there was\r\n  some evidence to support a factual issue of conscious pain and suffering based\r\n  on Ward's responses to directions. Id.\r\nRutland asserts there was sufficient evidence to\r\n  support a survival claim because a passerby indicated the decedent had a pulse\r\n  after the accident.Â  After reviewing the record, we conclude the trial court\r\n  did not err in granting SCDOT's motion for set-off based on the insufficiency\r\n  of the evidence to support a survival claim.Â  The record does not reveal any\r\n  evidence tending to show the decedent endured conscious pain and suffering.Â  In\r\n  fact, Rutland testified the decedent did not respond when he called her name,\r\n  the decedent did not make any noises, he knew she was dead immediately after\r\n  the accident, and he knew the decedent died even though he was told that the\r\n  decedent had a pulse.Â  Therefore, the SCDOT trial court did not err in\r\n  concluding that there was not sufficient evidence from which a jury could have\r\n  concluded the decedent experienced conscious pain and suffering.Â  \r\nB. &quot;Pre-Impact\r\n  Fear&quot;\r\nRutland argues the decedent experienced\r\n  &quot;pre-impact fear&quot; and suffered mental trauma because of her knowledge\r\n  of her impending death.Â  Rutland contends this &quot;pre-impact fear&quot; is\r\n  recoverable in a survival action when the decedent suffered mental trauma before\r\n  actual physical injury resulting in the decedent's death.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn support of his position, Rutland cites Spaugh v.\r\n  Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Co., 158 S.C. 25, 155 S.E. 145 (1930).Â  Spaugh involved a woman who became physically ill after experiencing a nervous\r\n  breakdown when she was stranded by a train company.Â  Id. at 27-29, 155\r\n  S.E. at 146-47.Â  The woman &quot;became highly nervous&quot; and &quot;suffered\r\n  from troubles peculiar to ladies, which condition was brought on her by the\r\n  exposure and experience she was subjected to.&quot;Â  Id. at 29-30, 155\r\n  S.E. at 147.Â  In affirming the trial court's denial of the defendant's directed\r\n  verdict motion, our supreme court concluded there was sufficient evidence that the\r\n  plaintiff suffered bodily injury.Â  Id. at 30, 155 S.E. at 147.Â  The\r\n  court stated, \r\n\r\n  In order to receive bodily injury, it was not\r\n    necessary that the plaintiff should lose a limb or receive a broken limb, or to\r\n    have wounds inflicted on her body.Â  Having her nervous system injured and being\r\n    made sick, in the manner she testified, constitutes bodily injury . . . provided\r\n    the proof establishe[d] negligence on the part of the defendant's agent . . .\r\n    and such negligence caused the alleged injury complained of. \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Rutland cites several cases in which\r\n  other jurisdictions have recognized a cause of action for &quot;pre-impact\r\n  fear.&quot;\r\nSouth Carolina does not recognize &quot;pre-impact\r\n  fear&quot; as a compensable cause of action.Â  See Hoskins v. King,\r\n  676 F. Supp. 2d 441, 451 (D.S.C. 2009) (concluding South Carolina law does not\r\n  permit recovery for pre-impact fright).Â  Also, we decline to extend the holding\r\n  in Spaugh for the proposition that &quot;pre-impact fear&quot; is\r\n  recoverable in this State. \r\nC. Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nRutland contends SCDOT is\r\n  bound by the sufficiency of the evidence in the settlement trial court's\r\n  order.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe settlement trial court's\r\n  order stated,\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court approves the allocation without making any factual findings about the\r\n    cause of the crash or the cause of Tiffanie Rutland's death but finds that\r\n    there exists some evidence, however slight, that Tiffanie Rutland survived the\r\n    crash and consciously endured pain and suffering prior to her death.Â  \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the order\r\n  further states, \r\n\r\n  Nothing\r\n    herein shall preclude by waiver or otherwise the right of SCDOT to argue\r\n    against the allocation or apportionment of wrongful death and survival proceeds\r\n    or findings herein, to which SCDOT does not stipulate at the appropriate later\r\n    time in the continuing litigation for purposes of set[-]off to which SCDOT may\r\n    be entitled.Â  \r\n\r\nBecause SCDOT was not a party\r\n  to the Bishop and GM settlements and the settlement trial court's order\r\n  expressly granted SCDOT the right not to stipulate to the findings of the\r\n  order, we conclude SCDOT was not bound by the settlement trial court's\r\n  sufficiency of the evidence ruling in regard to whether the decedent endured\r\n  conscious pain and suffering.Â  McCrea v. City of Georgetown, 384 S.C.\r\n  328, 332, 681 S.E.2d 918, 921 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating that a stipulation is an\r\n  agreement, admission, or concession made in judicial proceedings that are\r\n  binding upon those who make them).Â  Additionally, the settlement trial court's\r\n  order as it pertains to the non-binding effect of non-stipulated matters is the\r\n  law of the case because Rutland never appealed the order.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, LP v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327\r\n    S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling, right\r\n    or wrong, becomes the law of the case).\r\nD. Equitable Reallocation\r\nRutland finally contends the trial court erred in\r\n  equitably reallocating the Bishop and GM settlement proceeds and in applying\r\n  the full settlement award towards SCDOT's right of set-off.Â  Rutland argues the\r\n  trial court's reallocation of the settlement proceeds is improper because the\r\n  settlement agreement is binding and argues the decedent experienced conscious\r\n  pain and suffering. We disagree.\r\nA non-settling defendant is entitled to credit for the\r\n  amount paid by another defendant who settles.Â  Smalls v. S.C. Dep't of Educ.,\r\n  339 S.C. 208, 219, 528 S.E.2d 682, 688 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The trial court's jurisdiction to set-off one judgment\r\n  against another is equitable in nature and should be exercised when necessary\r\n  to provide justice between the parties. Welch,&nbsp;342 S.C. at 313, 536 S.E.2d at 425. \r\nIn Ward, the personal representative\r\n  settled with a co-defendant for $29,500 for pain and suffering and $500 for\r\n  wrongful death on behalf of the decedent.Â  290 S.C. at 559, 351 S.E.2d at 874.Â \r\n  The personal representative subsequently went to trial against Dr. Epting, the\r\n  non-settling defendant, and the jury awarded Ward $400,000 in actual damages\r\n  for wrongful death.Â  Id. at 552, 351 S.E.2d at 870.Â Â  Dr. Epting moved in\r\n    limine to assign the full amount of the settlement agreement to the\r\n  wrongful death action and argued the personal representative's settlement with\r\n  the co-defendant was a de facto settlement of the wrongful death action since\r\n  there was insufficient evidence to support a survival action.Â  Id. at\r\n  559, 351 S.E.2d at 874.Â  This court declined to reallocate the proceeds because\r\n  there was evidence that Ward was responding to directions following surgery;\r\n  therefore, there was sufficient evidence to present a jury question on\r\n  conscious pain and suffering.Â  Id. at 560, 351 S.E.2d at 875.Â  \r\nIn Welch, the personal representative settled\r\n  with a co-defendant for $445,000 for a survival claim and $5,000 for a wrongful\r\n  death claim.Â  Welch, 342 S.C. at 312, 536 S.E.2d at 425. The personal\r\n  representative asserted a wrongful death and survival action claim against Dr.\r\n  Epstein, and the jury awarded the personal representative $28,535.88 on the\r\n  survival claim, $3,000,000 on the wrongful death claim, and $3,900,000 in\r\n  punitive damages.Â  Id. at 287, 536 S.E.2d at 412.Â  Dr. Epstein filed a\r\n  post-trial motion for set-off based on the reallocation of the settlement\r\n  proceeds.Â  Id. at 312, 536 S.E.2d at 425.Â  The trial court reallocated\r\n  the proceeds in the amount of $28,535.88 for the survival action and\r\n  $421,464.12 in the wrongful death action.Â  Id.Â  In upholding the trial\r\n  court's reallocation, this court concluded that the reallocation must\r\n  &quot;yield to fairness and justice.&quot;Â  Id. at 313, 536 S.E.2d at\r\n  426.Â  This court also distinguished Ward on the grounds that the\r\n  decedent fell into a coma and the pain suffered by the decedent was directly\r\n  related to the surgery.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the court noted Dr. Epstein\r\n  was not a party to the settlement and was not bound by the settlement's terms.Â  Id.\r\nWe conclude the instant case is controlled by Welch.Â \r\n  The SCDOT trial court concluded, and we agree, the record does not contain any\r\n  evidence to support a survival action based on conscious pain and suffering\r\n  suffered by the decedent.Â  Thus, unlike in Ward, where there was\r\n  evidence that existed to prohibit the reallocation of the pain and suffering\r\n  and wrongful death claims, there is not sufficient evidence to present a jury\r\n  question that the decedent suffered conscious pain and suffering in the instant\r\n  case.Â  Moreover, SCDOT was not a party to the settlement agreement, and the\r\n  settlement trial court's order expressly granted SCDOT the right not to be\r\n  bound by the settlement agreement.Â  Therefore, we conclude the SCDOT trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in reallocating the settlement proceeds to\r\n  the wrongful death verdict against SCDOT. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial\r\n  court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] REA Construction Company was voluntarily dismissed\r\n  prior to trial.\r\n[2] The settlement trial court's order states,\r\n  &quot;Petitioner did not allege a survival action.Â  Nevertheless, the\r\n  Petitioner's settlement with [GM] includes settlement of all alleged and unalleged\r\n  claims, including Petitioner's wrongful death claim and any potential survival\r\n  claim.&quot;Â  \r\n[3] Rutland did not plead a survival claim against SCDOT or any other defendant.Â \r\n  However, the settlement trial court concluded the settlement included all\r\n  alleged and unalleged claims, including Rutland's wrongful death claim and any\r\n  potential survival claim against GM.Â  Even though Rutland failed to plead a\r\n  survival action, the elements of a survival action are discussed to analyze\r\n  whether the trial court properly concluded that there was insufficient evidence\r\n  to support a survival action in reallocating the proceeds of the survival\r\n  action to the wrongful death action.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4722","title":"Bennett v.

Rector\r\n    (Mother) appeals from the family court's order awarding Jack David Bennett\r\n    (Father) child support.Â  Mother contends the family court erred in (1) determining\r\n    the amount of child support under the Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines);\r\n    (2) making the award retroactive; and (3) awarding Father attorney's fees.Â  We\r\n    affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFather and Mother\r\n  married in 1989 and had a daughter (Daughter) in 1990.Â  In 1993, the parties\r\n  entered into a separation agreement under which Mother received sole custody of\r\n  Daughter and Father paid $500 a month in child support.Â  The parties divorced\r\n  in 1994.Â  In 1996, Mother married John Rector, an IBM executive.Â  On December\r\n  12, 2005, when Daughter was fifteen years old, she had a child (Grandchild).Â \r\n  Father filed a petition for ex parte relief against Mother on February 27, 2006,\r\n  seeking an emergency order awarding him temporary custody of Daughter.Â  He\r\n  alleged Daughter, Grandchild, and Mother were living with an unrelated male who\r\n  was not Mother's husband; Mother abused alcohol and drugs; and Mother had been\r\n  restrained by a magistrate for her behavior towards Father, including harassing\r\n  phone calls.Â  Father also filed a motion for temporary relief, requesting\r\n  custody, child support, and attorney's fees.Â  Additionally, Father filed a\r\n  complaint asking for temporary and permanent custody of Daughter.Â  Father\r\n  further requested Mother pay temporary and permanent child support and\r\n  attorney's fees.\r\nOn February 28,\r\n  2006, the family court entered a temporary order granting Father custody of\r\n  Daughter, pending a hearing on the motion for temporary relief.[1]Â \r\n  On March 6, 2006, the parties entered into an agreement that Father would have\r\n  temporary custody and Mother would pay child support pursuant to the Guidelines\r\n  and $1,500 towards Father's temporary attorney's fees.Â  An attached worksheet\r\n  determined Mother's temporary child support obligation under the Guidelines, based\r\n  upon gross monthly income of $2,298 and set the amount at $324 per month.Â  On\r\n  March 29, 2006, the family court approved and adopted the temporary agreement.\r\nOn December 6,\r\n  2006, Mother filed an answer to Father's complaint, relinquishing custody of\r\n  Daughter if Daughter wished to reside with Father.Â  She further stated she\r\n  should pay child support under the Guidelines if she is not the custodial\r\n  parent.\r\nBeginning\r\n  on June 5, 2007, the family court conducted a final hearing to determine child\r\n  support and whether to award attorney's fees.Â  Mother submitted a financial\r\n  declaration listing her monthly income at $1,967 and monthly expenses amounting\r\n  to $7,357, including $1,350 for the lease for her car.Â  Mother testified\r\n  she began working as a real estate agent in 2005.Â  She stated she applied for a\r\n  car loan on June 23, 2006, and provided her income as $141,000 a year but\r\n  contended that was projected income.[2]Â  Mother testified she was\r\n  up-to-date on her lease payments.Â  She also testified that in December of 2005,\r\n  she purchased a house for $795,000 using $450,000 she had acquired from other\r\n  property.Â  She stated she had completed an application for a $200,000 line of\r\n  equity against her home that listed her gross monthly income as $21,000.Â  She\r\n  explained she had based her income on that application on a real estate\r\n  commission she was expecting to receive but it was still pending and had not\r\n  yet closed.Â  Mother also testified she and Rector are separated but they\r\n  did not have a separation agreement and he does not pay her any spousal\r\n  support.[3]Â  She stated that\r\n  during their marriage, she and Rector had invested in real estate and bought\r\n  several properties as investments and that was her retirement plan.\r\nMother introduced\r\n  an expert qualified in domestic financial matters, Cindy MacCully, who assisted\r\n  her in drafting her financial declaration for the court.Â  MacCully testified\r\n  she did not impute any income to Mother in preparing the financial declaration\r\n  because Mother's properties were not idle land or vacation homes that were not\r\n  rented.Â  She further testified Mother was using gifts and loans from her mother\r\n  and equity lines to pay expenses, which MacCully did not consider income.Â  She also\r\n  stated she did not include money Mother obtained from refinancing in her\r\n  income.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the hearing, the family court issued a final order finding the majority of\r\n  Mother's testimony &quot;absolutely lacking in credibility.&quot;Â  The court\r\n  further found Mother\r\n\r\n\tvoluntarily\r\n  absented herself from the courtroom for approximately three-quarters . . . of\r\n  the hearing.Â  This [c]ourt has not previously encountered a situation where a\r\n  party voluntarily absented himself or herself from the courtroom during the\r\n  proceeding, although such occurrence might be expected or encountered in\r\n  default proceedings or where a party was unavailable by reason of distance or\r\n  illness, etc.Â  This case presented the first time that this [c]ourt has ever\r\n  had a party who was available but who voluntarily absented herself from the\r\n  courtroom during most of the proceedings.Â  This election on the part of\r\n  [Mother] denied the [c]ourt the opportunity to observe her demeanor during this\r\n  trial, other than during the period in which she was testifying.Â  During her\r\n  period of testimony, however, this [c]ourt finds her demeanor indicated a lack\r\n  of credibility.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  family court found based upon the lifestyle Mother enjoys, setting child\r\n  support based only upon $2,000 a month would be inequitable, particularly\r\n  because it would deprive Daughter from benefitting from the style of life that\r\n  Mother enjoys.Â  The court stated: &quot;This is a situation where it is proper\r\n  to impute income to [Mother] based upon her own testimony that she has the\r\n  ability to earn and that she believes that she will earn between $149,000 and\r\n  $252,000 per year.&quot;Â  The court used the lower of the two figures and\r\n  imputed to Mother $12,416.66 per month in gross income for purposes of\r\n  determining the amount of child support.Â  The family court ordered Mother to\r\n  pay child support of $1,138 per month, retroactive to March 6, 2006.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the family court found Mother's failure to file responsive pleadings in a\r\n  timely manner and be truthful and honest about her ability to earn income\r\n  prolonged the matter.Â  It also found the matter was difficult for Father to\r\n  prosecute because whether custody was being contested was unknown and a great\r\n  deal of discovery had to be conducted to determine Mother's ability to earn an\r\n  income.Â  Further, the court found the &quot;litigation was complicated and\r\n  prolonged by [Mother's] failure to accept reality and by her failure to be\r\n  credible and forthcoming in her dealings when trying to resolve these issues.&quot;Â \r\n  The family court determined the time spent was necessary; Father's attorney\r\n  charged customary fees, was regularly before the family court, and was in good\r\n  standing; Mother had the ability to pay her own fees as well as part of\r\n  Father's based on her lavish lifestyle and the $400,000 in equity she has in\r\n  her home, whereas Father had taken out a loan and reduced his lifestyle to pay\r\n  for his attorney; and Father had received beneficial results.Â  The family court\r\n  ordered Mother to pay $25,000 in attorney's fees to Father.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;On appeal from a family court order, this [c]ourt has\r\n  authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307\r\n  S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  &quot;Because the family court is\r\n  in a superior position to judge the witnesses' demeanor and veracity, its\r\n  findings should be given broad discretion.&quot;Â  Scott v. Scott, 354\r\n  S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  When the evidence is disputed, the\r\n  appellate court may adhere to the family court's findings. Â Woodall v.\r\n    Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Child Support\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in determining the amount of child support Father\r\n  would receive under the Guidelines by improperly determining her gross monthly\r\n  income.Â  Specifically, she contends the family court could not use potential\r\n  income because it made no finding she was unemployed or underemployed.Â \r\n  Further, Mother maintains the family court improperly deviated from the\r\n  Guidelines.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A child support\r\n  award rests in the discretion of the trial judge, and will not be altered on\r\n  appeal absent abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Floyd v. Morgan,&nbsp;383 S.C.\r\n  469, 475, 681 S.E.2d 570, 573&nbsp;(2009).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when\r\n  the decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual findings\r\n  lacking evidentiary support.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500,\r\n  602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally, the family court is required to\r\n  follow the Guidelines in determining the amount of child support.Â  Sexton v.\r\n    Sexton, 321 S.C. 487, 490, 469 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1996). Although\r\n  the Guidelines govern all actions involving child support, the family court\r\n  retains discretion when making the final award.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322\r\n  S.C. 7, 13, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).\r\n\r\n\tIn any proceeding\r\n  for the award of child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the\r\n  amount of the award which would result from the application of the [G]uidelines\r\n  . . . is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.Â  A different amount\r\n  may be awarded upon a showing that application of the [G]uidelines in a particular\r\n  case would be unjust or inappropriate.Â  When the court orders a child support\r\n  award that varies significantly from the amount resulting from the application\r\n  of the [G]uidelines, the court shall make specific, written findings of those\r\n  facts upon which it bases its conclusion supporting that award.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-17-470(A) (2010).Â  &quot;Deviation from the [G]uidelines should be the\r\n  exception rather than the rule.Â  When the court deviates, it must make written\r\n  findings that clearly state the nature and extent of the variation from the [G]uidelines.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4710(B) (Supp. 2009).\r\n&quot;The [G]uidelines define income as\r\n  the actual gross income of the parent, if employed to full capacity, or\r\n  potential income if unemployed or underemployed.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  114-4720(A)(1) (Supp. 2009).Â  &quot;Gross income includes income from any source\r\n  including salaries, wages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, rents (less\r\n  allowable business expenses), dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest,\r\n  trust income, annuities, capital gains, . . . and alimony, including alimony\r\n  received as a result of another marriage . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  114-4720(A)(2) (Supp. 2009).Â  Child support payments do not\r\n  have to be made solely from current earnings. Â Sutton v. Sutton, 291\r\n  S.C. 401, 406, 353 S.E.2d 884, 887&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).Â  &quot;The assets of a\r\n  person having the duty to support a child may be considered in determining the\r\n  amount of child support.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The court may also take into\r\n  account assets available to generate income for child support.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(2)(A).Â  &quot;In addition to\r\n  determining potential earnings, the court should impute income to any\r\n  non-income producing assets of either parent, if significant, other than a\r\n  primary residence or personal property.Â  Examples of such assets are vacation\r\n  homes (if not maintained as rental property) and idle land.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(2)(B). &quot;Ordinarily, the court will determine income\r\n  from verified financial declarations required by the Family Court rules.Â \r\n  However, . . . where the amounts reflected on the financial declaration may be\r\n  an issue, the court may rely on suitable documentation of current earnings . .\r\n  . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(6) (Supp. 2009). \r\n&quot;If the court finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed\r\n  or underemployed, it should calculate child support based on a determination of\r\n  potential income which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5) (Supp. 2009).Â  &quot;In order to impute income to a parent who is\r\n  unemployed or underemployed, the court should determine the employment\r\n  potential and probable earnings level of the parent based on that parent's\r\n  recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job\r\n  opportunities and earning levels in the community.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  114-4720(A)(5)(B).Â  A bad faith motivation is not required for a finding of\r\n  voluntary underemployment.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13, 636 S.E.2d\r\n  864, 866 (2006). &quot;However, the motivation behind any purported reduction\r\n  in income or earning capacity should be considered in determining whether a\r\n  parent is voluntarily underemployed.&quot;Â  Spreeuw v. Barker, 385 S.C.\r\n  45, 62, 682 S.E.2d 843, 851&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  When actual income\r\n  versus earning capacity is at issue, courts should closely examine a good-faith\r\n  and reasonable explanation for the decreased income.Â  Id. Â \r\nAlthough the family court did make some reference to deviation\r\n  from the Guidelines, that is not what it did.[4]Â  Instead, it found Mother's gross income\r\n  to be greater than she claimed.Â  Mother obviously had access to a large amount\r\n  of money judging from her monthly expenses, expensive properties, and shopping\r\n  habits.Â  Mother listed her monthly income at the amount the family court found\r\n  it to be and higher on documents she filled out during the pendency of this\r\n  case.Â  She has $30,000 in a savings account that she claims she inherited and\r\n  also owns several expensive properties.Â  The family court is allowed to take this\r\n  into account when determining the amount of child support.Â  Allowing Mother\r\n  to receive the benefit of such an extravagant lifestyle while only paying child\r\n  support based on income of $23,000 a year would be inequitable.Â  \r\nWe leave matters of credibility to the family court, and the\r\n  record supports the family court's finding Mother uncredible.Â  Although the\r\n  family court found Mother's expert credible, it recognized she completed the\r\n  financial declaration based on Mother's uncredible information.Â  The family\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in determining the amount of child support.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's award of $1,138 per month in child\r\n  support.\r\nII.&nbsp; Retroactive Child Support\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in applying the higher amount of child support\r\n  retroactively because the parties stipulated to the temporary amount and did\r\n  not stipulate that it would be reviewed.Â  Further, she argues Father did not\r\n  plead or argue at the final hearing for an increase to be applied retroactively.Â \r\n  We find this issue unpreserved for our review.\r\n&quot;When\r\n  a party receives an order that grants certain relief not previously\r\n  contemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move,\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to\r\n  preserve the issue for appeal.&quot; Â In re Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998). Â Mother contends that Father never requested\r\n  the award to be retroactive.Â  Accordingly, when the family court made the award\r\n  retroactive in its order, Mother needed to raise the issue in a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion.Â  Because she did not, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nMother\r\n  maintains the family court erred in awarding Father attorney's fees because she\r\n  did not prolong the case and the case was largely uncontested.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court has discretion in deciding whether to award\r\n  attorney's fees, and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d\r\n  741, 748 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled\r\n  by an error of law or is based on factual findings lacking evidentiary\r\n  support.Â  Degenhart, 360 S.C. at 500, 602 S.E.2d at 97.Â  In deciding\r\n  whether to award attorney's fees, the family court should consider (1) each\r\n  party's ability to pay his or her own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained\r\n  by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) the\r\n  effect of the fees on each party's standard of living.Â  Patel v. Patel,\r\n  359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining reasonable\r\n  attorney's fees, the six factors the family court should consider are &quot;(1)\r\n  the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily\r\n  devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of\r\n  compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; [and] (6) customary legal fees\r\n  for similar services.&quot;Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court has previously held when parties fail to cooperate and their behavior\r\n  prolongs proceedings, this is a basis for holding them responsible for\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  Anderson v. Tolbert, 322 S.C. 543, 549-50, 473\r\n  S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 1996); see alsoDonahue, 299 S.C. at 365, 384 S.E.2d at 748 (holding husband's\r\n  &quot;lack of cooperation . . . serves as an additional basis for the award of\r\n  attorney's fees&quot;); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 304, 372\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 115 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing husband's lack of cooperation in\r\n  discovery as basis for increasing wife's attorney fees award on appeal). &quot;An\r\n  adversary spouse should not be rewarded for such conduct.&quot;Â  Anderson,\r\n  322 S.C. at 549, 473 S.E.2d at 459.\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees\r\n  or in determining the amount of attorney's fees.Â  It considered all of the\r\n  appropriate factors and stated why those factors supported awarding Father\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  The record contains evidence to support each of the family\r\n  court's findings.Â  Father prevailed on all issues, and Mother has the ability\r\n  to pay the fees.Â  Further, Mother's dishonesty about her income was the main\r\n  source of contention.Â  Additionally, her failure to respond to pleadings\r\n  prolonged the matter.Â  Because the evidence in the record supports the family\r\n  court's findings as to attorney's fees, it did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  awarding attorney's fees and calculating the amount.[5]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in determining the amount of child\r\n  support or awarding Father attorney's fees.Â  Additionally, Mother's argument\r\n  that the family court erred in applying the child support award retroactively\r\n  is unpreserved for our review. Â Accordingly, the family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Custody of Grandchild was an issue before the family\r\n  court but is not an issue on appeal.\r\n[2] The loan application actually lists her yearly income\r\n  at $149,000, with $100,000 as her gross annual income and an additional $49,000\r\n  in rental income.\r\n[3] Mother and Rector's 2005 joint income tax return\r\n  lists $193,472 as &quot;wages, salaries, tips, etc.&quot; \r\n[4] The family court specifically stated: &quot;I'm not\r\n  deviating from the [G]uidelines. . . . I was making my ruling based upon\r\n  imputed income, and that is not a deviation from the [G]uidelines.Â  That,\r\n  instead, is a finding of imputed income.Â  In using that amount, there is no deviation\r\n  from the [G]uidelines.&quot; \r\n[5] Mother further contends a portion of Father's\r\n  attorney's fees were due to third parties.Â  However, Mother never argued this to\r\n  the family court.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (Ct.

Hudgins, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAssistant Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, of Columbia, and Solicitor\r\n  J. Gregory Hembree, of Conway; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Ronnie W. Wilson\r\n  appeals his convictions for criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated\r\n  nature (CDVHAN) and kidnapping, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  grant a mistrial after a prosecuting witness testified to Wilson's prior bad\r\n  acts. We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWilson\r\n  was indicted for CDVHAN, possession of a weapon during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime, first-degree burglary, and kidnapping.Â  \r\nIn limine,\r\n  Wilson moved for the exclusion of the victim's testimony referencing alleged\r\n  prior abuse by Wilson.Â  Specifically, Wilson argued a 2004 incident which the\r\n  victim mentioned in a videotaped statement could not be introduced.Â  The solicitor\r\n  acquiesced and stated, &quot;I've spoken to my victim . . . she understands\r\n  that that would be a prior bad act which could not be elicited on direct\r\n  examination.&quot;Â  However, on direct examination, after describing her\r\n  relationship with Wilson, when asked if there was anything else the jury needed\r\n  to know about their relationship, the victim answered:\r\n\r\n\tOther\r\n  than, you know, I had on several attempts left him . . . when I realized that\r\n  he, that there was going to be a problem with him being violent towards me I\r\n  chose to try to end the relationship so that there would not be any\r\n  altercations.\r\n\tThere\r\n  was one time that he did grab me by my neck.Â  There were physical bruises . . .\r\n  . \r\n\r\nWilson objected and\r\n  moved for a mistrial, arguing the parties agreed to exclude evidence of the\r\n  2004 incident.Â  The State argued the mistrial motion should be denied because\r\n  the victim did not reference the 2004 incident.[2]Â \r\n  The trial court denied the motion, finding the victim said nothing about 2004\r\n  and little harm was done.Â  The State mentioned it would have no objection to a\r\n  curative instruction, but Wilson declined such an instruction stating,\r\n  &quot;I'd rather leave it alone[.]&quot;Â  The jury found Wilson guilty of CDVHAN\r\n  and kidnapping, and he received concurrent sentences of ten years and\r\n  twenty-two years, respectively.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUE\r\n  ON APPEAL\r\nWilson\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a mistrial.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs a threshold\r\n  issue, the State argues Wilson's allegation that the trial court erred in\r\n  failing to grant his motion for a mistrial is not preserved.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe State maintains that in order for\r\n  Wilson to preserve his allegation of error, he was required to move to strike\r\n  the offensive testimony, request or accept the trial court's offer of a\r\n  curative charge, and then if unsatisfied renew his motion for a mistrial.Â  The\r\n  State cites State v. Patterson for the proposition that an issue is not\r\n  preserved where counsel does not move to strike testimony and does not request\r\n  a curative instruction.Â  324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997).Â  The State also\r\n  cites State v. Ferguson to argue that a party moving for a mistrial must\r\n  make a contemporaneous objection to the sufficiency of a curative charge and/or\r\n  renew his motion for a mistrial following the instruction.Â  376 S.C. 615, 658\r\n  S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  The State further relies on State v. Jones for\r\n  the general rule that a curative charge is generally considered to cure any\r\n  error, and thus avers by failing to request or accept the trial court's\r\n  curative charge, Wilson's argument has in essence been waived.Â  Â 325 S.C. 310,\r\n  479 S.E.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  We find the State's argument on appeal misapprehends\r\n  the law as it pertains to this case.\r\nAppellate\r\n  courts have recognized that an issue will not be preserved for review where the\r\n  trial court sustains a party's objection to improper testimony and the\r\n  party does not subsequently move to strike the testimony or for a mistrial.Â  Patterson,\r\n  324 S.C. at 18, 482 S.E.2d at 766 (emphasis added); see also State v.\r\n    Wingo, 304 S.C. 173, 177-78, 403 S.E.2d 322, 325 (Ct. App. 1991) (stating\r\n  that a motion to strike is necessary where a question is answered before an\r\n  objection may be interposed, even after the objection has been sustained).Â  The\r\n  rationale for this rule is clear; without a motion to strike or motion for a\r\n  mistrial, when the objecting party is sustained, he has received what he asked\r\n  for and cannot be heard to complain about a favorable ruling on appeal.Â  See State v. Primus, 341 S.C. 592, 604, 535 S.E.2d 152, 158 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (stating &quot;the cases are legion in holding if an appellant objects and\r\n    the objection is sustained but he does not move for a curative instruction\r\n  or request a mistrial, he has received what he asked for and cannot be heard to\r\n  complain on appeal&quot;) (emphasis original) overruled on other grounds by State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d\r\n  103&nbsp;(2002).Â  When an objecting party is sustained, the trial court\r\n  has rendered a favorable ruling, and therefore, it becomes necessary that the\r\n  sustained party move to cure, or move for a mistrial if such a cure is\r\n  insufficient, in order to create an appealable issue.Â  Moreover, as the law\r\n  assumes a curative instruction will remedy an error, failure to accept such a\r\n  charge when offered, or failure to object to the sufficiency of that charge,\r\n  renders the issue waived and unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See, e.g., State v. White, 371 S.C. 439, 445, 639 S.E.2d 160, 163 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (indicating a curative charge is generally deemed to cure an allegation of\r\n  error).Â  \r\nOn the other hand, when an objection has\r\n  been overruled, the objecting party has suffered an adverse ruling which\r\n  can be appealed without any further allegation of error.Â  The South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court has stated: \r\n\r\n\tIt is argued however that the issue of\r\n  improper closing argument by plaintiff's counsel was not preserved for review.Â \r\n  It is contended that the failure of defendant's counsel to request a curative\r\n  instruction, a mistrial or new trial after his objection had been overruled is fatal. This Court has held in \r\n\tBowers v. Watkins Carolina Express, Inc.,\r\n  259 S.C. 371, 376, 192 S.E.2d 190[ 192 (1972)], that motions for mistrial or\r\n  new trial in such circumstances would be futile and are not necessary to\r\n  preserve a timely objection for review. By the same logic it would be both\r\n  futile and nonsensical for counsel to request curative instructions from a\r\n  trial court which has already ruled an argument to be proper. \r\n\r\nCity\r\n  of Columbia v. Myers,\r\n  278 S.C. 288, 289, 294 S.E.2d 787, 788 (1982) (emphasis added); see State\r\n    v. McFadden, 318 S.C. 404, 410, 458 S.E.2d 61, 65 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding\r\n  an appellant's allegation of error to be waived because after the trial court\r\n  sustained the objection to the offensive testimony the sustained party did not\r\n  thereafter move to strike it).Â  By the same reasoning, in overruling an\r\n  objection the trial court rejects the allegation of error and rules the\r\n  evidence proper and admissible.Â  In this vein, because the admission of proper\r\n  evidence requires no curative charge, an overruled party is under no obligation\r\n  to accept a curative instruction in order to preserve the issue for our\r\n  review.Â  See Myers, 278 S.C. at 289, 294 S.E.2d at 788 (labeling\r\n  motions and further objections made after the trial judge has overruled an\r\n  objection to be both futile and nonsensical). Â Â \r\nAdmittedly,\r\n  shortened statements of the rule on this issue may lend to confusion on the\r\n  matter.Â  SeeÂ  State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 164, 467 S.E.2d 272,\r\n  276 (Ct. App. 1996) (&quot;In rejecting the trial court's offer to strike the\r\n  testimony or give a curative instruction, [the appellant] waived any complaint\r\n  he had to the challenged testimony.&quot;). Â In Watts, although the\r\n  motion for mistrial was denied, the court notes the trial court offered a\r\n  curative charge.Â  Id. Â As admissible evidence requires no curative\r\n  charge, the trial court must have sustained the evidentiary objection which\r\n  supported the motion for mistrial.Â  Further, the Watts court cites only\r\n  to Wingo for the specific proposition that an issue is not preserved\r\n  &quot;where [the] defendant did not move to strike the testimony after his\r\n  objection was sustained.&quot; Â Id. (emphasis added).Â  Additionally,\r\n  in State v. Tucker, the appellant argued he was deprived of a fair trial\r\n  because the State allegedly made inappropriate statements in closing argument.Â \r\n  324 S.C. 155, 169, 478 S.E.2d 260, 267 (1996).Â  In responding to this argument\r\n  the appellate court simply stated: &quot;[i]nitially, Appellant has waived this\r\n  issue because he refused the trial judge's offer of a curative\r\n  instruction.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Although completely unclear whether any\r\n  underlying objection was made at all, let alone whether it was sustained or\r\n  overruled, the court cited specifically and solely to Watts for the much\r\n  shortened rule statement that &quot;[an appellant] waives objection if [a] curative\r\n  instruction is refused.&quot;Â  Id.Â  However, despite abbreviating the\r\n  language of the law, these cases make no clear indication of a departure from\r\n  the established rule and rationale of Myers to warrant application of\r\n  this rule to circumstances in which an objecting party is overruled.Â Â  \r\nIn this case, Wilson objected to the\r\n  introduction of the testimony and moved for a mistrial simultaneously.Â  A\r\n  motion for a mistrial is, by its very nature, both an allegation of error and\r\n  an allegation of prejudice sufficient to warrant a mistrial.Â  See State\r\n    v. Harris, 382 S.C. 107, 117, 674 S.E.2d 532, 537 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;A\r\n  mistrial should only be granted when absolutely necessary, and a defendant must\r\n  show both error and . . . prejudice in order to be entitled to a\r\n  mistrial.&quot;).Â  Although the trial court briefly touched on the issue of\r\n  prejudice, it overruled Wilson's objection and admitted the testimony.Â \r\n  Therefore, because Wilson's objection was overruled, he was not required to make\r\n  another motion for mistrial or under any obligation to accept a curative\r\n  charge.\r\nAccordingly, we find Wilson's allegation\r\n  of error is preserved for our review, and we herein address the merits.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court.Â  The trial court's decision will not be overturned on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.&quot;Â  Id. (internal citations omitted).Â  A mistrial should only be granted when\r\n  absolutely necessary, and a defendant must show both error and prejudice in\r\n  order to be entitled to a mistrial.&nbsp; Id.Â  &quot;Insubstantial\r\n  errors that do not impact the result of the case do not warrant a mistrial when\r\n  guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence.&quot;Â  White, 371\r\n  S.C. at 447-48, 639 S.E.2d at 164.Â  &quot;The determination of prejudice must\r\n  be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts\r\n  of each case.&quot;Â  Id. at 447, 639 S.E.2d at 164.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, although it would appear the trial transcript is in excess of four\r\n  hundred pages, the record on appeal consists of only twenty-five pages,\r\n  including (1) the in limine agreement to exclude prior bad act evidence,\r\n  (2) the portion of the victim's testimony preceding Wilson's objection, (3)\r\n  Wilson's objection and the arguments regarding mistrial, and (4) the\r\n  indictments.Â  The record indicates nothing of whether additional witnesses\r\n  testified or if other evidence, such as photographs, was admitted.Â \r\n  Accordingly, even assuming for the sake of argument that the admission of the\r\n  testimony was error, we find no indication of prejudice in the record.Â  See id. at 448, 639 S.E.2d at 164 (indicating prejudice must be based on\r\n  review of the entire record). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find no\r\n  prejudice, the trial court's denial of Wilson's motion for a mistrial is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  PIEPER, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This appeal is decided without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] The victim was asked whether the abuse she mentioned\r\n  occurred in 2004, and she explained it happened after 2004.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4724","title":"State v.

Â We affirm.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  FACTS\r\n  \r\n  \r\nOrr was\r\n  indicted for first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and committing a\r\n  lewd act upon a minor in Charleston County.Â  The State alleged Orr sexually assaulted\r\n  his wife's nine-year-old granddaughter (the victim) on November 25, 2003.[1] Â At trial, the victim testified Orr sexually assaulted her while she was\r\n  sleeping on the couch in the home Orr shared with her grandmother. Â According\r\n  to the victim, Orr removed her shorts, pushed her underwear to the side, and\r\n  began &quot;licking&quot; her &quot;private part.&quot;Â  Sheila Sheppard, Orr's\r\n  wife and the victim's grandmother, testified she walked into the living room\r\n  and saw Orr &quot;having oral sex&quot; with the victim. Â Sheppard stated she\r\n  then hit Orr on the head with a cordless telephone and he ran out of the house.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhile police officers were on the scene, Orr returned to the house. Â When\r\n  he entered, the victim and Sheppard both identified him as the person who\r\n  assaulted the victim, and he was taken into custody. Â The victim was\r\n  transported to the hospital for a sexual assault examination.Â  Other than a\r\n  small abrasion near the hymen, the victim's examination was normal. Â The\r\n  victim's clothes were taken into evidence and later testing by the South\r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) indicated the presence of saliva and\r\n  male DNA in the victim's underwear.Â  Further testing revealed Orr's DNA matched\r\n  the DNA found in the victim's underwear.Â  The jury found Orr guilty of first-degree\r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor and committing a lewd act upon a minor.Â \r\n  Orr was given concurrent sentences of twenty-five years' imprisonment for the\r\n  criminal sexual conduct charge and fifteen years' imprisonment for the lewd act\r\n  charge.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law\r\n  only. State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â \r\n  Thus, this court is bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are\r\n  clearly erroneous. Â Id.Â  &quot;On review, this [c]ourt is limited to\r\n  determining whether the circuit court abused its discretion.&quot; Â State v.\r\n  Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 158, 682 S.E.2d 19, 26 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;This\r\n  [c]ourt does not reevaluate the facts based on its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the circuit court's\r\n  ruling is supported by any evidence.&quot; Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; Motion for Mistrial\r\n  Orr argues the trial court erred in\r\n    denying his motion for a mistrial. Â We find this issue is not preserved for our\r\n    review.Â  \r\n  Officer Austin Rogers of the North\r\n    Charleston Police Department testified Orr returned to the house while he and\r\n    another officer were still on the scene.Â  Â Officer Rogers testified:\r\n  \r\n\tRogers:Â \r\n    I approached Mr. Orr, who after --- I don't know if I can say what he said to\r\n    me ---\r\n\tSolicitor:Â  No. That's hearsay.\r\n\r\n  Officer Rogers then testified he placed Orr under\r\n    investigative detention and escorted him out of the house and into his patrol\r\n    car.Â  Later, during cross-examination, Orr requested an in camera hearing. Â During the hearing, Orr read a portion of the transcript from the Jackson v. Denno hearing at his first trial, at which Officer Rogers\r\n    testified Orr told him &quot;he just wanted to straighten things out,&quot; and\r\n    that he &quot;didn't do anything.&quot;Â  Orr informed the trial court he wanted\r\n    to ask Officer Rogers about Orr's statement in order to elicit that specific response.Â \r\n    The State argued Orr's statement was hearsay. Â Orr maintained his statement was\r\n    an excited utterance, and thus, an exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Orr argued his\r\n    statement was an excited utterance because he was under stress after being\r\n    accused of sexually assaulting the victim and seeing the police at his house. \r\n  The trial court sustained the State's objection\r\n    to the admission of Orr's statement and ruled it was not an excited utterance.Â \r\n    The trial court found it was not an excited utterance because if it were then\r\n    any self-serving statement made &quot;at or near the time of an arrest . . .Â  would\r\n    qualify for admission under the excited utterance exception.&quot;Â  Orr then expressed\r\n    concern over the jury's impression after Officer Rogers was not allowed to testify\r\n    as to what Orr said upon entering the house.Â  The trial court agreed to\r\n    give the jury a curative instruction.Â  Orr declined a curative instruction, arguing\r\n    it would only draw more attention to the issue.Â  Subsequently, Orr made a\r\n    motion for a mistrial.Â  \r\n  On appeal, Orr maintains the trial court\r\n    erred in denying his motion for a mistrial.Â  By rejecting the trial court's\r\n    offer to give a curative instruction, Orr waived any challenge to Officer\r\n    Rogers' testimony on appeal. Â See Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co.,\r\n    321 S.C. 1, 11, 466 S.E.2d 727, 732 (1996) (finding party waived right to\r\n    complain of error when trial court's offer of curative instruction refused); see\r\n      also State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 169, 478 S.E.2d 260, 267 (1996)\r\n    (finding issue unpreserved when defendant refused trial court's curative\r\n    instruction); State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 164, 467 S.E.2d 272, 276\r\n    (Ct. App. 1996) (&quot;In rejecting the trial court's offer to strike the\r\n    testimony or give a curative instruction, [the defendant] waived any complaint\r\n    he had to the challenged testimony.&quot;). Â Accordingly, we affirm the trial\r\n    court's decision to deny Orr's motion for a mistrial. \r\n  II.&nbsp; Cross-Examination of\r\n    Sheppard\r\n  Orr argues the trial court erred in\r\n    refusing to allow him to cross-examine Sheppard regarding allegations of\r\n    infidelity in their marriage. Â We disagree.\r\n  During his cross-examination of Sheppard,\r\n    Orr requested an in camera hearing to proffer testimony regarding infidelity\r\n    allegations in his marriage to Sheppard. Â Orr argued it was his intent to show\r\n    there was distrust in the marriage and that Sheppard had a bias against him.Â  During\r\n    the in camera hearing, Sheppard admitted she had accused Orr of cheating;\r\n    however, she testified Orr had never accused her of cheating. Â Orr then read\r\n    Sheppard's testimony from the transcript of his first trial at which Sheppard\r\n    admitted Orr had accused her of cheating. Â When asked whether her previous\r\n    testimony was accurate, Sheppard testified: &quot;[Orr] never accused me of\r\n    cheating.Â  I mean, he had his assumption, but he never brought it to me.&quot; Â The\r\n    trial court excluded Sheppard's prior testimony and found that because she\r\n    denied any bias, Orr would be unable to elicit any evidence of bias in front of\r\n    the jury.Â  Furthermore, the trial court ruled Orr could not introduce\r\n    Sheppard's prior testimony as an inconsistent statement because the infidelity\r\n    issue was not material to Orr's prosecution.Â  The trial court also noted Orr\r\n    failed to establish a timely nexus between the accusations of infidelity and\r\n    the assault on the victim. \r\n  &quot;The admission of evidence is within\r\n    the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n    discretion.&quot; State v. Page, 378 S.C. 476, 481, 663 S.E.2d 357, 359\r\n    (Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\n    the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error\r\n    of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Â Pursuant to Rule 608(c), SCRE: &quot;Bias,\r\n    prejudice or any motive to misrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness\r\n    either by examination of the witness or by evidence otherwise adduced.&quot;Â  Â Because\r\n    Sheppard denied Orr had ever accused her of infidelity in her proffered\r\n    testimony, Orr was unable to demonstrate any bias or motive existed.Â  Orr also failed\r\n    to show the allegations of infidelity occurred within a reasonable time before\r\n    Orr was charged with sexually assaulting the victim.Â  Therefore, the trial\r\n    court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Sheppard's testimony regarding\r\n    infidelity.Â  \r\n  III.&nbsp; Chain of Custody\r\n  Orr argues the trial court erred in failing\r\n    to require Officer Brandy Paulson to testify at trial pursuant to Rule 6,\r\n    SCRCrimP.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\n  A blood sample was collected from Orr for\r\n    comparison purposes. Â At trial, Robin Taylor, a forensic DNA analyst at\r\n    SLED, testified as to the chain of custody regarding the suspect kit that\r\n    contained Orr's blood sample. Â When Taylor was asked who delivered the suspect kit\r\n    to SLED, Orr objected on the basis that Officer Paulson's signature on the\r\n    package was hearsay. Â The State argued the chain of custody only had to be\r\n    established as far as practical and explained that Officer Paulson was\r\n    bedridden with a broken ankle. Â The trial court ruled that Taylor's testimony\r\n    regarding the signature was not hearsay. Â The trial court noted that Officer\r\n    Paulson's signature was not &quot;an out of court statement offered to prove\r\n    its truth,&quot; but rather it was &quot;an out of court act that [was]\r\n    testified to and explained by several different witnesses.&quot;Â  \r\n  Orr maintains Officer Paulson was required\r\n    to appear and testify pursuant to Rule 6, SCRCrimP, after Orr objected to\r\n    Taylor's testimony.Â  At trial, Orr did not object to Taylor's testimony\r\n    regarding Officer Paulson's signature based on an insufficient chain of\r\n    custody.Â  Instead, Orr's objection was based on hearsay.Â  At no time did Orr raise\r\n    Rule 6, SCRCrimP, or assert that Officer Paulson was required to testify.Â  Thus,\r\n    this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Moore,\r\n    357 S.C. 458, 464, 593 S.E.2d 608, 612 (2004) (holding an issue must be raised\r\n    to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for review); State v.\r\n      Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2003) (holding a\r\n    defendant may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal).Â  \r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court\r\n  is\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDUROS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Orr's first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury\r\n  was unable to reach a verdict.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4725","title":"Ashenfelder v.

Lindemann, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant-Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid J. Gundling, of Pawleys Island, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  \r\n  In this cross-appeal, the City of Georgetown (the City) alleges the trial court\r\n  erred in denying its directed verdict motions on David Ashenfelder's causes of\r\n  action for conversion and prescriptive easement.Â  Ashenfelder alleges the trial\r\n  court erred in granting directed verdicts on his causes of action for adverse\r\n  possession, declaratory judgment, estoppel, trespass, and inverse condemnation prior\r\n  to the declaration of a mistrial.Â  We dismiss the appeal as premature.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nA vehicle struck and severely damaged a\r\n  billboard in Georgetown operated by Ashenfelder. Â Prior to the accident,\r\n  Ashenfelder never formally sought a sign permit from the City. Â After the\r\n  accident, the City removed and disposed of the damaged billboard and Ashenfelder\r\n  inquired as to the possibility of rebuilding the billboard. Â The City informed\r\n  Ashenfelder that the billboard was located on city property and that the City\r\n  would not issue a permit allowing him to rebuild. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAshenfelder originally filed\r\n  suit against the City asserting certain federal constitutional claims along\r\n  with state law claims.Â  The City removed the action to the United States\r\n  District Court for the District of South Carolina. Â Subsequently, the district court\r\n  dismissed Ashenfelder's federal claims and remanded the state law claims to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  Upon remand, Ashenfelder amended his complaint to add Lucien\r\n  Bruggeman as an additional defendant. Â In his second amended complaint, Ashenfelder\r\n  asserted causes of action for adverse possession and prescriptive easement\r\n  against Bruggeman; he also asserted causes of action for conversion, negligence,\r\n  trespass, estoppel, declaratory judgment, and inverse condemnation against the\r\n  City. Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe case proceeded to trial,\r\n  and the City moved for directed verdicts on all causes of action at the close\r\n  of Ashenfelder's case.Â  The trial court directed a verdict and dismissed\r\n  Ashenfelder's causes of action for adverse possession, declaratory judgment,\r\n  estoppel, negligence,[1] trespass, and inverse condemnation.Â  The trial judge denied the City's motion\r\n  for a directed verdict on Ashenfelder's claims for conversion and prescriptive\r\n  easement.Â  After the jury was unable to reach a verdict, the trial court\r\n  declared a mistrial and denied the City's renewed directed verdict motions on\r\n  the remaining two causes of action. The City and Ashenfelder both appealed.[2]Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  An appellate court may determine the\r\n    question of appealability of a decision from a lower court as a matter of law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2009) (creating\r\n    appellate jurisdiction in law cases); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200(a) (Supp. 2009)\r\n    (setting forth the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals); City of\r\n      Newberry v. Newberry Elec. Coop., Inc., 387 S.C. 254, 256, 692 S.E.2d 510,\r\n    512 (2010) (&quot;Statutory interpretation is a question of law.&quot;).Â  Even\r\n    if not raised by the parties, this court may address the issue of appealability ex mero motu.Â  Main Corp. v.

Â In his cross-appeal, Ashenfelder\r\n  alleges the trial court erred in directing verdicts on his causes of action for\r\n  adverse possession, declaratory judgment, estoppel, trespass, and inverse\r\n  condemnation.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis case presents a question\r\n  as to the effect of a mistrial on appealability in a case with multiple claims\r\n  and multiple defendants where the court directs a verdict on some, but not all,\r\n  claims prior to the mistrial.Â  Jurisprudence as to a mistrial holds:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tA mistrial is the equivalent of no\r\n    trial and leaves the cause pending in the circuit court.Â  State v. Smith, 336 S.C. 39, 518 S.E.2d 294 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  It leaves the parties &quot;as though\r\n    no trial had taken place.&quot;Â  Grooms v.

Powell, 213 S.C. 570, 572, 50 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1948).\r\n\r\n  State v. Woods,\r\n    382 S.C. 153, 158, 676 S.E.2d 128, 131 (2009).Â  A mistrial based on the failure\r\n    of a jury to agree is not directly appealable.Â  Keels, 213 S.C. at\r\n    572-73, 50 S.E.2d at 705.Â  The denial of a directed verdict is not appealable\r\n    until after final judgment.Â  Id. at 573, 50 S.E.2d at 705.Â  \r\n  \r\nSection 14-3-330 controls the right\r\n  of appeal. Â Ex parte Capital U-Drive-It, Inc., 369 S.C. 1, 6, 630 S.E.2d\r\n  464, 467 (2006).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tThe\r\n    Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law\r\n    in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n\t(1)\r\n    Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits\r\n    in actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought\r\n    there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or\r\n    jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no\r\n    appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from\r\n    such final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily\r\n    affecting the judgment not before appealed from; \r\n\t(2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an\r\n    action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a\r\n    judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b)\r\n    grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof\r\n    or any pleading in any action; \r\n\t(3) A final order affecting a substantial right made\r\n    in any special proceeding or upon a summary application in any action after\r\n    judgment; and \r\n\t(4) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of\r\n    common pleas granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction or\r\n    granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing the appointment of a receiver. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\nS.C.

When more than one claim for relief is presented in\r\n    an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim,\r\n    or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a\r\n    final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties\r\n    only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and\r\n    upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such\r\n    determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however\r\n    designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and\r\n    liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to\r\n    any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject\r\n      to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the\r\n      claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\r\n\r\n  Rule 54(b), SCRCP (bold emphasis in original)\r\n    (italicized emphasis added).Â  \r\n  In Link v. School District of Pickens County,\r\n    302 S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990), the supreme court considered the impact of\r\n    Rule 54(b) where the appellant failed to immediately appeal a partial grant of\r\n    summary judgment.Â  The process of directing entry of judgment on one or more,\r\n    but less than all, claims under Rule 54(b) is referred to as certification.Â  Link,\r\n    302 S.C. at 4, 393 S.E.2d at 177.Â  The court noted that an order which is\r\n    immediately appealable by statute is not rendered unappealable because it has\r\n    not been certified under Rule 54(b).Â  Id.Â  Ultimately, the court found the\r\n    appellant was entitled, pursuant to section 14-3-330(1), to wait until there\r\n    was a final judgment against him to appeal the partial grant of summary\r\n    judgment.Â  Id. at 6, 393 S.E.2d at 179.Â  However, the court recognized:\r\n  \r\n\tThis\r\n    Court has not had occasion to address the effect of granting a Rule 54(b)\r\n    certification on appealability.Â  Until the adoption of the South Carolina Rules\r\n    of Civil Procedure, &quot;final judgment&quot; was a term of art denoting the\r\n    disposition of all issues in the action.Â  This is the definition which\r\n    has traditionally been applied to the term &quot;final judgment&quot; in [section]\r\n    14-3-330(1).Â  Rule 54(b) certification purports to alter the definition of\r\n    &quot;final judgment&quot; by allowing a final judgment to be entered on\r\n    certain claims before disposition of the entire case.Â  Until this Court\r\n    determines whether granting certification mandates an immediate appeal, the\r\n    safer course is to immediately appeal any order certified under Rule 54(b).Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  Id. at 5\r\n    n.3, 393 S.E.2d at 178 n.3 (emphasis in original) (internal citations\r\n    omitted).Â  \r\n  The supreme court specifically\r\n    indicated in Link that it has not yet addressed the effect of\r\n    certification by a trial court.Â  Id.Â  Even though the partial decision\r\n    herein was not certified by the trial court, this case involves an additional\r\n    concern under Rule 54(b) that was not addressed in Link.Â  The rule\r\n    specifically states that when fewer than all claims have been adjudicated,\r\n    &quot;the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time\r\n    before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and\r\n    liabilities of all the parties.&quot;Â  Rule 54(b), SCRCP.Â  Because the directed\r\n    verdicts on Ashenfelder's causes of action for adverse possession, declaratory\r\n    judgment, estoppel, trespass, and inverse condemnation are subject to revision\r\n    under Rule 54(b) in the absence of certification, we need not yet reach whether\r\n    the decisions are immediately appealable under section 14-3-330.Â  In essence,\r\n    we are one step removed from the question of whether section 14-3-330 is\r\n    controlling, as noted in Link, because we do not yet have a decision\r\n    that dons a veil of appealability due to the potential for revision.Â  Appellate\r\n    courts should not delve into the realm of reviewing decisions that may be\r\n    altered by the trial judge.Â  See, e.g., State v. Glenn, 285 S.C.\r\n    384, 385, 330 S.E.2d 285, 285-86 (1985) (finding appellate review speculative\r\n    when the trial judge is free to alter his ruling).Â  \r\n  A\r\n    trial judge may direct a verdict where there are no material facts in dispute\r\n    and the case presents only a question of law.Â  Rule 50(a), SCRCP; Fields v.\r\n      J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 564, 658 S.E.2d 80, 90\r\n    (2008).Â  However, that decision is still subject to revision at any time before\r\n    entry of that judgment by the clerk when the directed verdict is not certified\r\n    and other claims in the action have not yet been adjudicated:Â  \r\n  \r\n\tThe\r\n    trial judge, under our procedure, is afforded many opportunities to change his\r\n    mind. For instance, no authority is needed for the proposition that a trial\r\n    judge, even after judgment, has the right to grant a new trial based upon his\r\n    reconsideration of a previous motion for directed verdict and of course many\r\n    other illustrations could be given of a trial judge's right to reconsider\r\n    decisions he has made during the course of a trial and before final judgment is\r\n    entered. \r\n\r\n  PPG Indus., Inc. v.\r\n    Orangeburg Paint &amp; Decorating Ctr., Inc., 297 S.C. 176, 183, 375 S.E.2d 331, 335 (Ct. App. 1988); see also Rule 54(b), SCRCP; Grooms, 246 S.C. at 514, 144 S.E.2d at 910\r\n    (&quot;When the trial of this case was thus terminated, the status of the\r\n    litigation and of the parties became the same as though no trial had taken\r\n    place.&quot;).Â  \r\n  Moreover,\r\n    this court has had the opportunity to explore the application of Rule 54(b),\r\n    finding the time to file post-trial motions did not begin to run until all\r\n    claims had been adjudicated, where there was no &quot;express\r\n    determination&quot; that there was no reason for delay in entering judgment on\r\n    the previously adjudicated claims.Â  Holroyd v. Requa, 361 S.C. 43,\r\n    53-54, 603 S.E.2d 417, 422 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This court has also held that Rule\r\n    54(b) does not require certification, but if the court chooses to certify a\r\n    judgment, it must do so in a definite and unmistakable manner.Â  Tommy L.\r\n      Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc.,\r\n    351 S.C. 459, 466, 570 S.E.2d 197, 200 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Federal Rule 54(b) is\r\n    substantially similar to the South Carolina rule.Â  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n    54(b).Â  Under the federal rule, &quot;[a]bsent a certification under Rule 54(b)\r\n    any order in a . . . multiple[]claim action, even if it appears to adjudicate a\r\n    separable portion of the controversy, is interlocutory.&quot;Â  10 Charles Alan\r\n    Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 2654 (3d ed. 2010).Â  &quot;[A]n appeal from a decision adjudicating a portion\r\n    of the case must be dismissed.&quot;Â  10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller,\r\n    and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 2660 (3d ed. 2010).Â  \r\n  As\r\n    previously indicated, in the context of a mistrial in a case involving multiple\r\n    claims, Rule 54(b) suggests that the directed verdicts on some claims may not\r\n    be final because these decisions are subject to revision.Â  While it may be\r\n    possible for us to harmonize the rule with mistrial jurisprudence by limiting\r\n    its impact to evidentiary or similar trial decisions, the specific language of\r\n    Rule 54(b) is much broader as it addresses any decision or order, however\r\n    designated; ultimately, we may wish to review the need to revise the rule if we\r\n    do not wish to accept its parameters or if it is inconsistent with desired\r\n    appellate jurisprudence.Â  In addition, we recognize that there are judicial\r\n    economy arguments under either interpretation; however, the scope of the rule\r\n    greatly assists the appellate review process, especially in a situation where\r\n    the record does not include the entry of any written decision on the partial\r\n    judgment.Â  Similarly, judicial economy is thwarted if trials are stopped upon\r\n    appeal of a partial directed verdict after presentation of the plaintiff's\r\n    case.\r\n  In\r\n    this matter, no judgment was ever entered by the clerk and, as indicated, no\r\n    written or form order memorialized the directed verdicts.Â  See Serowski\r\n      v. Serowski, 381 S.C. 306, 315, 672 S.E.2d 589, 594 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n    (&quot;Until written and entered, a court has discretion to modify or amend a\r\n    ruling.&quot;).Â  Rather, the only order entered was a form order declaring a\r\n    mistrial.Â  See Rule 58(a)(2), SCRCP (&quot;Subject to the provisions of\r\n    Rule 54(b) . . . the court shall promptly prepare the form of the judgment . .\r\n    . and after review and approval by the court, the clerk shall promptly enter\r\n    it.&quot;).Â  Therefore, because the decision is subject to revision pursuant to\r\n    Rule 54(b) and because there is neither a written order memorializing the\r\n    directed verdicts under Rule 58(a)(2) nor entry of an order, the only judgment\r\n    in this case is the order declaring a mistrial.Â  See Rule 77(d), SCRCP; Grooms,\r\n    246 S.C. at 514, 144 S.E.2d at 910.\r\n  Rule\r\n    54(b), without conflicting with Link, affords the trial court an\r\n    opportunity to exercise its discretion to make sure there will be no need to\r\n    revise a directed verdict or any other decision.Â  Aside from a hung jury, it is\r\n    possible for a court to grant a mistrial based on its own recognition of error\r\n    in earlier rulings or in the proceedings.Â  See Ford v. State Ethics\r\n      Comm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 645, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) (&quot;There is no\r\n    dispute a trial court has the discretion to change its mind and amend its oral\r\n    ruling.&quot;); PPG Indus., Inc., 297 S.C. at 183-84, 375 S.E.2d at 335\r\n    (discussing the many opportunities of the trial court to change its mind).Â \r\n    Thus, the rule affords the court the opportunity to correct its prior rulings\r\n    or address any fairness or other concerns about the trial proceedings.Â \r\n    Pursuant to the process of certification, the appellate courts of this state\r\n    need not question whether or not the possibility of revision exists.Â  Moreover,\r\n    this requirement does not present an onerous burden upon trial counsel because\r\n    a motion to certify need not be extensive, if such motion is desired.Â \r\n    Importantly, the analysis herein does not preclude entry of an order\r\n    maintaining the earlier directed verdicts; instead, the focus of the rule\r\n    invites a determination by the trial court that the decision is no longer\r\n    subject to revision.Â  Once we are assured that the possibility of revision no\r\n    longer exists, then we may proceed to analyze whether a decision is appropriate\r\n    for appeal under Link and section 14-3-330.[3]\r\n  Turning\r\n    to the case at hand, the directed verdicts on Ashenfelder's claims remain\r\n    subject to revision.Â  There is no written order directing the clerk to enter\r\n    judgment, as required by the Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  See Rule 58(a),\r\n    SCRCP (&quot;A judgment is effective only when so set forth and entered in the\r\n    record.&quot;).Â  \r\n  \r\nWithout prejudice, the appeal\r\n  in this matter is hereby\r\n\r\n\r\nDISMISSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ashenfelder did not address the ruling on his cause\r\n  of action for negligence in his statement of issues on appeal.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(B) (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set\r\n  forth in the statement of issues on appeal.&quot;).\r\n[2] Bruggeman did not appeal.\r\n[3] We are hesitant to apply a ten-day cap on revision of\r\n  the court's oral rulings because that ten-day period is also necessarily tied\r\n  to the entry of a written order.Â  See Leviner v. Sonoco Prods. Co., 339 S.C. 492,\r\n  494, 530 S.E.2d 127, 128 (2000) (stating that a trial judge has only ten days\r\n  from entry of judgment to alter or amend an earlier order absent an indication\r\n  that a more full and complete order or judgment is to follow).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4726","title":"GEICO v.

Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe facts in this\r\n  case are undisputed.Â  Sometime in early 2003, Draine decided to switch his\r\n  automobile insurance coverage from Farm Bureau Insurance to GEICO.Â  In March\r\n  2003, GEICO sent Draine the documentation necessary to add him as a\r\n  policyholder.Â  Included therein was a form offering UIM coverage.Â  On March 20,\r\n  2003, Draine completed the UIM offer form, rejecting all UIM coverage.Â  The\r\n  parties have stipulated that this March 2003 offer and rejection of UIM coverage\r\n  complied with all aspects of South Carolina law.Â  \r\nUpon receipt of the\r\n  completed UIM offer form and the required premium, GEICO issued an automobile\r\n  insurance policy to Draine that did not include UIM coverage.Â  In 2004,\r\n  Draine's policy was renewed and, as before, it did not include UIM coverage.[1]Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 26, 2005, GEICO sent Draine materials so that his policy could again be\r\n  renewed.Â  Included in the documents that GEICO provided to Draine was a UIM\r\n  offer form.Â  Like the 2003 offer form, the 2005 offer form contained the\r\n  following two provisions:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\t IF YOU ARE A NEW APPLICANT AND\r\n  DO NOT SIGN AND RETURN THIS FORM, we\r\n  will include Uninsured Motorist and Underinsured Motorist limits equal to your\r\n  Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability limits.Â  This may result in a\r\n  change to your premium.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\t IF YOU ARE A CURRENT SOUTH\r\n  CAROLINA POLICYHOLDER, you must\r\n  complete, sign and return this form only if you want to make changes to your\r\n  policy. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDraine did not complete the\r\n  offer form or return it to GEICO.Â  Instead, Draine delivered to GEICO a check\r\n  for the premium necessary to renew his existing policy, which included $25,000\r\n  in liability coverage but no UIM coverage.Â  \r\nGEICO subsequently\r\n  renewed Draine's policy.Â  The dates of coverage provided by the renewed policy\r\n  were March 11, 2005 through September 11, 2005.Â  \r\nOn March 13, 2005, Draine was involved in an automobile accident caused by another driver.Â  As a\r\n  result of the accident, Draine incurred damages in excess of the other driver's\r\n  liability insurance coverage.Â  After settling his claim against the driver, in\r\n  exchange for a covenant not to execute, Draine submitted a claim to GEICO for\r\n  UIM benefits.Â  GEICO declined to pay the claim on the ground that Draine's\r\n  policy did not include UIM coverage.Â  \r\nThereafter, GEICO\r\n  filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a judicial determination that Draine was not entitled to UIM benefits.Â  Draine answered and counterclaimed, arguing\r\n  that his policy should be reformed to include $25,000 in UIM coverage.Â  Draine\r\n  contended that such relief was appropriate under section 38-77-350(E) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2002) because GEICO's 2005 renewal materials included a\r\n  UIM offer form, which he had not returned.Â  \r\nThe case proceeded\r\n  to a non-jury trial before the circuit court, where it was tried on stipulated\r\n  facts, exhibits, and the arguments of counsel.Â  In an order filed July 2, 2008,\r\n  the circuit court granted judgment in favor of GEICO, concluding that\r\n  reformation of Draine's policy was not warranted.Â  Specifically, the circuit\r\n  court found that &quot;a common sense reading&quot; of section 38-77-350\r\n  demonstrated that the legislature intended to restrict subsection (E) of that\r\n  statute to &quot;new applicants.&quot;Â  Additionally, the circuit court found\r\n  that reformation of Draine's policy was not warranted under contract law\r\n  because (1) Draine never intended to change his policy to add UIM coverage and\r\n  (2) Draine was sophisticated with regard to such matters and thus could not\r\n  have been confused by the 2005 UIM offer form.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court err by holding that section 38-77-350(E) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2002) did not mandate the reformation of Draine's automobile\r\n  insurance policy to include $25,000 in UIM coverage?\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\n&quot;When\r\n  an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free\r\n  to review whether the trial court properly applied the law to those\r\n  facts.&quot;Â  J.K.

Carolina Reg'l Sewer Auth., 336\r\n  S.C. 162, 166, 519 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1999).Â  &quot;In such cases, the appellate\r\n  court owes no particular deference to the trial court's legal\r\n  conclusions.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAutomobile\r\n  insurance carriers like GEICO are required to offer &quot;at the option of the\r\n  insured&quot; UIM coverage up to the limits of the insured's liability coverage.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).Â  Section 38-77-350 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2002 &amp; Supp. 2009) sets forth specific requirements regarding the\r\n  offering of optional coverages, such as UIM coverage.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Draine contends that, under section 38-77-350(E), GEICO was\r\n  required to add UIM coverage to his policy when he failed to return the UIM\r\n  offer form that he received as part of GEICO's 2005 renewal materials.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the legislature.&quot;Â  Blackburn v. Daufuskie Island Fire Dist.,\r\n  382 S.C. 626, 629, 677 S.E.2d 606, 607 (2009). Â In ascertaining legislative\r\n  intent, &quot;a court should not focus on any single section or provision but\r\n  should consider the language of the statute as a whole.&quot;Â  Mid-State\r\n    Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690,\r\n  692 (1996). Â &quot;A statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable,\r\n  and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the\r\n  lawmakers.&quot;Â  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575\r\n  (2010) (quoting Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d\r\n  115, 117 (1992)).\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  statute in question here, section 38-77-350, reads as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(A) The director or his designee shall approve a form\r\n  that automobile insurers shall use in offering optional coverages required\r\n    to be offered pursuant to law to applicants for automobile insurance policies.\r\n  This form must be used by insurers for all new applicants. Â The form, at\r\n  a minimum, must provide for each optional coverage required to be offered: [the\r\n  required contents of the form are omitted for brevity].\r\n\t\t(B) If this form is signed by the named insured,\r\n  after it has been completed by an insurance producer or a representative of the\r\n  insurer, it is conclusively presumed that there was an informed, knowing\r\n  selection of coverage and neither the insurance company nor an insurance\r\n    agent is liable to the named insured or another insured under the policy for\r\n    the insured's failure to purchase optional coverage or higher limits.\r\n\t\t(C) An automobile insurer is not required to\r\n  make a new offer of coverage on any automobile insurance policy which renews,\r\n  extends, changes, supersedes, or replaces an existing policy.\r\n\t\t(D) Compliance with this section satisfies the insurer\r\n  and agent's duty to explain and offer optional coverages and higher limits and\r\n\t\tno\r\n    person, including, but not limited to, an insurer and insurance agent is liable\r\n    in an action for damages on account of the selection or rejection made by the\r\n    named insured.\r\n\t\t(E) If the insured fails or refuses to return an\r\n  executed offer form within thirty days to the insurer, the insurer shall add on\r\n  uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverages with the same policy\r\n  limits as the insured's liability limits.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350 (2002\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009) (emphases added).\r\nUnder\r\n  section 38-77-350(E), an insurer is required to add UIM coverage to an\r\n  insured's policy when &quot;the insured fails or refuses to return an executed\r\n  offer form within thirty days to the insurer.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(E)\r\n  (2002).Â  Here, it is undisputed that Draine timely returned an executed offer\r\n  form rejecting UIM coverage when he initially became insured with GEICO in\r\n  2003.Â  Although Draine did not return the 2005 UIM offer form he received when renewing\r\n  his policy, section 38-77-350(E) does not expressly require an insured to\r\n  return an executed offer form every time one is provided in order to avoid the addition\r\n  of UIM coverage.Â  Rather, it merely provides that &quot;an executed offer form&quot;\r\n  must be returned &quot;within thirty days.&quot;[2] Â \r\nDraine\r\n  nonetheless contends that if an insurer provides an existing insured with a UIM\r\n  offer form when the insured renews his coverage, the insurer must add optional\r\n  UIM coverage if the insured does not timely return the form, even if the\r\n  insured had previously rejected UIM coverage.Â  We disagree.Â  In our view, reading\r\n  section 38-77-350 as a whole leads to the conclusion that GEICO was not\r\n  required to add UIM coverage to Draine's policy when Draine failed to return\r\n  the UIM offer form he received when he renewed his policy in 2005.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  find that such an interpretation is consistent with the purpose and design of\r\n  section 38-77-350.\r\nA.&nbsp; Subsections (A) and (C) of Section\r\n  38-77-350\r\nThe underlying\r\n  premise of Draine's argument in this case is that the term &quot;form&quot; in subsection\r\n  (E) of section 38-77-350 includes UIM offer forms that are provided to insureds\r\n  who are renewing their existing policies.Â  However, when that subsection is\r\n  read in conjunction with subsections (A) and (C) of section 38-77-350, it\r\n  becomes apparent that Draine's premise is flawed. \r\nSection\r\n  38-77-350(A), which sets forth the basic requirements for the UIM offer form, provides\r\n  guidance as to what the legislature meant when it used the word\r\n  &quot;form&quot; in section 38-77-350(E).Â  See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,\r\n  546 U.S. 21, 34 (2005) (&quot;[I]dentical words used in different parts of the\r\n  same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning.&quot;); Busby\r\n    v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 330, 333, 312 S.E.2d 716, 718\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (&quot;Where the same word is used more than once in a statute\r\n  it is presumed to have the same meaning throughout unless a different meaning\r\n  is necessary to avoid an absurd result.&quot;). Â Importantly, section\r\n  38-77-350(A) states that the offer form must be used for &quot;new\r\n  applicants.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A) (Supp. 2009).Â  Additionally,\r\n  it provides that the form must be used &quot;in offering optional coverages required\r\n    to be offered pursuant to law.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Draine was not a &quot;new applicant&quot; when GEICO sent\r\n  him a UIM offer form in 2005.Â  In the context of UIM cases, this court has\r\n  construed the term &quot;new applicant&quot; as meaning &quot;those who . . .\r\n  never had an opportunity to reject UIM coverage.&quot;Â  See McDonald\r\n    v. S.C. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 120, 124, 518 S.E.2d 624, 626 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999).Â  Here, at the time that Draine initially became a GEICO\r\n  policyholder in 2003, he was properly offered UIM coverage, which he rejected.Â \r\n  Therefore, when Draine sought to renew his existing policy in 2005, he did not\r\n  constitute a &quot;new applicant&quot; as contemplated by section 38-77-350(A).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  as Draine concedes, UIM coverage was not &quot;required to be offered pursuant\r\n  to law&quot; when he renewed his policy in 2005. Â Section 38-77-350(C)\r\n  expressly provides that &quot;[a]n automobile insurer is not required to\r\n  make a new offer of coverage on any automobile insurance policy which renews,\r\n  extends, changes, supersedes, or replaces an existing policy.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(C) (2002) (emphases added).Â  Although this court has held that\r\n  section 38-77-350(C) is inapplicable when the insurer has not made a previous\r\n  effective offer of optional coverage,[3] in this case, it is undisputed that GEICO's 2003 offer of UIM coverage was\r\n  effective.Â  Accordingly, GEICO was not required to offer UIM coverage to Draine\r\n  when he renewed his policy in 2005.Â  See Burnet R. Maybank, III et al., The\r\n    Law of Automobile Insurance in South Carolina IV-37 (4th ed. 2000)\r\n  (&quot;The insurer is not required to make another offer of optional coverages\r\n  pursuant to [section 38-77-350] at renewal time provided a properly completed\r\n  and executed form has been previously obtained from the insured being\r\n  renewed.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  section 38-77-350(A) does not require an insurer to provide a UIM offer form to\r\n  an insured who is renewing an existing policy, it is questionable whether the\r\n  legislature intended for section 38-77-350(E) to apply in such a situation.Â  Cf. Howell v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 505, 509-10, 636\r\n  S.E.2d 626, 628-29 (2006) (concluding that because liability coverage for hired\r\n  and non-owned vehicles is not statutorily required, an insurer providing only that\r\n  type of voluntary coverage need not comply with section 38-77-160's requirement\r\n  to offer UIM coverage). Â While section 38-77-350(E) uses the general term\r\n  &quot;form,&quot; a basic rule of statutory construction is that &quot;general wordsâ€”and\r\n  it makes no difference how generalâ€”will be confined to the subject treated\r\n  of.&quot;Â  Henderson v. McMaster, 104 S.C. 268, 272, 88 S.E. 645, 646\r\n  (1916); see also Beattie v. Aiken County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 319\r\n  S.C. 449, 452, 462 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1995) (&quot;An entire code section should\r\n  be read as a whole so that phraseology of an isolated section is not\r\n  controlling.&quot;). Â Absent legislative intent to the contrary, a statutory\r\n  term should not be given a more expansive construction in one subsection of the\r\n  statute than in another subsection.Â  See Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\r\n  513 U.S. 561, 572-73 (1995) (rejecting the argument that the word\r\n  &quot;prospectus&quot; had a broader meaning in one section of the Securities\r\n  Act of 1933 than in another section).Â  Thus, because section 38-77-350(A)'s use\r\n  of the term &quot;form&quot; does not encompass non-required UIM offer forms\r\n  given during the renewal process, it is unlikely that section 38-77-350(E)'s\r\n  use of that term should include such forms.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Subsections (B) and (D) of Section\r\n  38-77-350\r\nSection\r\n  38-77-350(B) provides further support for the conclusion that Draine's policy\r\n  should not be reformed to add UIM coverage.Â  Pursuant to section 38-77-350(B),\r\n  if an insured executes a properly completed offer form that complies with\r\n  section 38-77-350(A), the insurer cannot be held liable under the policy for\r\n  the insured's failure to purchase UIM coverage. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (Supp.\r\n  2009).\r\nHere,\r\n  the parties have stipulated that, in 2003, Draine properly rejected UIM\r\n  coverage by executing an offer form that complied with all aspects of South\r\n  Carolina law.Â  While Draine did not execute the UIM offer form that he received\r\n  when he renewed his coverage in 2005, section 38-77-350(B) expressly references\r\n  the &quot;form&quot; described in section 38-77-350(A).[4]Â \r\n  As noted above, section 38-77-350(A)'s use of the term &quot;form&quot; does\r\n  not include non-required UIM offer forms given during the renewal process.Â \r\n  Therefore, because GEICO properly offered, and Draine properly rejected, UIM\r\n  coverage in 2003 when Draine was a &quot;new applicant,&quot; section\r\n  38-77-350(B) appears to preclude us from holding GEICO liable under Draine's\r\n  policy for Draine's failure to purchase UIM coverage.\r\nLike section\r\n  38-77-350(B), section 38-77-350(D) also provides support for the conclusion\r\n  that the legislature did not intend for an insurer to be held liable in a case\r\n  like the one presented here.Â  Under section 38-77-350(D), an insurer satisfies\r\n  his duty to offer UIM coverage by complying with the relevant provisions of section\r\n  38-77-350, and the insurer cannot subsequently be held liable in an action for\r\n  damages on account of the insured's rejection of UIM coverage.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(D) (2002).Â  Here, it is undisputed that GEICO properly\r\n  complied with section 38-77-350 when it initially offered UIM coverage to\r\n  Draine in 2003 and that he expressly rejected UIM coverage at that time.Â \r\n  Although it is true that GEICO offered Draine optional coverage again when he\r\n  renewed his policy in 2005, Draine made no indication that he wanted to\r\n  purchase UIM coverage.Â  Accordingly, based upon sections 38-77-350(B) and (D), we\r\n  conclude that GEICO should not be held liable in any way for Draine's failure\r\n  to purchase UIM coverage. \r\nC.&nbsp; Purpose and Design of Section\r\n  38-77-350\r\nWe\r\n  believe that our interpretation of section 38-77-350 is consistent with the\r\n  purpose and design of the statute.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has\r\n  explained that &quot;[t]he purpose of requiring automobile insurers to make a\r\n  meaningful offer of additional UM or UIM coverage 'is for insureds to know\r\n  their options and to make an informed decision as to which amount of\r\n  coverage will best suit their needs.'&quot;Â  Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins.\r\n    Co., 367 S.C. 253, 262-263, 626 S.E.2d 6, 12 (2005) (quoting Progressive\r\n      Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 352, 608 S.E.2d 569, 573 (2005))\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  When an insured does not return a UIM offer form, the\r\n  insurer cannot be certain that the insured actually made a decision regarding\r\n  UIM coverage.Â  Accordingly, the legislature has chosen to create a statutory\r\n  presumption that the insured desires coverage in such cases.Â  Here, however,\r\n  Draine unquestionably made an informed decision rejecting UIM coverage in 2003.Â  See Â§ 38-77-350(B) (providing that if UIM coverage is offered and\r\n  rejected in accordance with section 38-77-350, then it is &quot;conclusively\r\n  presumed&quot; that an &quot;informed&quot; choice was made).Â  In view of that\r\n  fact, it does not make sense to presume that Draine desired UIM coverage in\r\n  2005 merely because he failed to return the UIM offer form he received when he\r\n  renewed his policy that year.Â  \r\nA somewhat\r\n  similar conclusion was reached by this court in United Services Automobile\r\n    Ass'n v. Litchfield, 356 S.C. 582, 590 S.E.2d 47 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In that\r\n  case, the court addressed whether it was appropriate to reform an insured's automobile\r\n  insurance policy to include UIM coverage when the insured previously informed her\r\n  insurer that she wanted to drop her UIM coverage. Â The insured contended the\r\n  policy should be reformed because the insurer did not make a valid offer of UIM\r\n  coverage when she purchased her policy.Â  Id. at 584, 590 S.E.2d at 48.Â  On\r\n  appeal, this court, without addressing the validity of the insurer's offer, concluded\r\n  the policy should not be reformed to include UIM coverage.Â  The court explained\r\n  that finding in favor of the insured &quot;would make no sense&quot; given that\r\n  the insured had previously contacted the insurer &quot;for the specific purpose\r\n  of dropping [UIM] coverage.&quot;Â  Id. at 584, 590 S.E.2d at 49.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  like in Litchfield, it would not make sense to hold that Draine's\r\n  failure to return the 2005 UIM offer form dictated the addition of UIM coverage\r\n  to Draine's policy given that (1) Draine had expressly rejected GEICO's legally\r\n  compliant offer of UIM coverage just two years earlier and (2) the 2005 UIM\r\n  offer form specifically advised current South Carolina policyholders like\r\n  Draine that they were required to return the form &quot;only if you want\r\n  to make changes to your policy.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  Taken together, these\r\n  two facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that Draine made an informed\r\n  decision to reject UIM coverage.Â  Therefore, finding that Draine is not\r\n  entitled to reformation of his policy does not offend section 38-77-350's\r\n  purpose of protecting insureds from uninformed decisions regarding optional\r\n  coverages.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that section 38-77-350(E) did not require GEICO to\r\n  add UIM coverage to Draine's policy when Draine failed to return the UIM offer\r\n  form he received as part of GEICO's 2005 renewal materials.[5]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nKONDUROS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The record is\r\n  unclear as to whether Draine was offered UIM coverage when he renewed his\r\n  policy in 2004.Â  \r\n[2] While section 38-77-350(E) does not specify the event\r\n  that triggers the commencement of the thirty-day time period, it is reasonable\r\n  to presume that the legislature intended for the triggering event to be an\r\n  event mentioned in the statute.Â  See S. Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. S.C.\r\n    Windstorm &amp; Hail Underwriting Ass'n, 306 S.C. 339, 342, 412 S.E.2d 377,\r\n  379 (1991) (&quot;[W]ords in a statute must be construed in context.&quot;). Â For\r\n  reasons discussed herein, we conclude that section 38-77-350(E)'s thirty-day\r\n  time period is triggered by the provision of offer forms to &quot;new applicants&quot;\r\n  as set forth in section 38-77-350(A), rather than by the provision of offer\r\n  forms to existing policyholdersâ€”an event not contemplated by the statute. \r\n[3] See Antley\r\n  v.

Darwin, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Â Tommy Logan appeals from the trial\r\n  court's order granting the Gaffney Board of Public Works' (the Board) motion to\r\n  dismiss Logan's negligence action based on the statute of limitations.Â  Logan\r\n  argues the trial court erred by granting the Board's motion because discovery\r\n  was not complete, and the Board's denial of any involvement caused Logan to sue\r\n  only Cherokee Landscaping.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  January 23, 2003, Logan was removing snow from Spring Street in Gaffney, South\r\n  Carolina, when the blade of his front-end loader struck a manhole cover, and as\r\n  a result, he was thrown into the windshield of his vehicle and seriously\r\n  injured.[2]Â \r\n  Prior to the accident, in October 2002, Cherokee Landscaping and Grading\r\n  Company (Cherokee) resurfaced Spring Street by paving it with asphalt.Â  On\r\n  October 29, 2004, Logan sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the\r\n  Board for &quot;any and all information regarding road work done on Spring\r\n  Street and/or Turner Street in Gaffney, South Carolina.&quot;Â  In response, on\r\n  November 30, 2004, the Board's attorney stated the Board &quot;reviewed [its]\r\n  files and [had] no design documents, work orders, specific or general, dates of\r\n  paving, dates of sewer work or any other information pertaining to any work\r\n  performed on Spring and/or Turner Streets.&quot; \r\nOn\r\n  December 9, 2005, Logan filed a negligence action against Cherokee, alleging it\r\n  had a duty to the public and Logan to pave or resurface the street in a\r\n  reasonable manner to minimize the risk of injury to the users of the street.Â \r\n  In its answer, dated March 20, 2006, Cherokee stated as a defense that the\r\n  Board was &quot;responsible for placing the manhole cover and/or ring on the\r\n  roadway in question, such that any defect and/or problem with the manhole cover\r\n  and/or ring would be the responsibility of the [Board].&quot;Â  Therefore, Cherokee\r\n  asserted the Board was liable for any injuries suffered by Logan.Â  Cherokee\r\n  also alleged that Logan failed to bring the action against it within the\r\n  applicable statute of limitations, and thus, the action should be dismissed.[3]\r\nOn August 22, 2007, Logan filed an amended complaint, adding the\r\n  Board as a party and alleging the Board should have known the manhole's\r\n  condition created an unreasonable risk of personal injury to the users of\r\n  Spring Street.Â  The Board moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, on\r\n  September 21, 2007, asserting Logan failed to bring the action against the\r\n  Board within the two-year statute of limitations set forth in the South\r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  In response, Logan asserted the statute of\r\n  limitations had not run because the supervisors and employees of the Board\r\n  &quot;intentionally or negligently provided incomplete and/or inaccurate\r\n  information to [Logan] in an attempt to prevent [Logan] from filing a lawsuit\r\n  against the Board&quot;; therefore, Logan argued the Board should be equitably\r\n  estopped from asserting the defense of the statute of limitations.Â  The court\r\n  heard Cherokee's motion for\r\n  summary judgment and the Board's motion to dismiss on December 17, 2007.Â  During\r\n  the hearing, the court denied Cherokee's motion for summary judgment.Â \r\n  Thereafter, on March 6, 2008, the court granted the Board's motion to dismiss,\r\n  finding Logan had failed to (1) commence suit against the Board within the\r\n  two-year statute of limitations, and (2) offer any evidence that would estop\r\n  the Board from asserting the two-year deadline for bringing the action.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing a dismissal of a claim for\r\n  failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under Rule\r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as the\r\n  trial court.Â  Sloan Constr. Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., 377 S.C. 108,\r\n  112, 659 S.E.2d 158, 161 (2008).Â  &quot;The question for the court is whether\r\n  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in\r\n  his behalf, the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint state any\r\n  valid claim for relief.&quot;Â  Id. at 112-113, 659 S.E.2d at 161.Â  The\r\n  court will not sustain the motion if the &quot;facts alleged and inferences\r\n  reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any\r\n  theory of the case.&quot;Â  Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457\r\n  S.E.2d 601, 603 (1995).[4]Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLogan argues the trial court erred in granting the Board's motion\r\n  to dismiss because the Board's denial of any involvement caused Logan to sue\r\n  only Cherokee Landscaping.Â  Specifically, Logan asserts the Board should have\r\n  been estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense because it\r\n  misled Logan by denying any involvement with the manhole cover that resulted in\r\n  Logan's injury.Â  We disagree. \r\nThis action is governed by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act's\r\n  two-year statute of limitations period for tort claims brought against a\r\n  governmental entity.[5]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(a) (2005).Â  The courts of South Carolina apply the\r\n  &quot;discovery rule&quot; to determine when a cause of action accrues under\r\n  the Tort Claims Act.Â  Bayle v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 123,\r\n  542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  According to the discovery rule, the\r\n  statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injury resulting from\r\n  the wrongful conduct either is discovered or may have been discovered by the exercise\r\n  of reasonable diligence.Â  Id.Â  &quot;The date on which discovery of the\r\n  cause of action should have been made is an objective, rather than a\r\n  subjective, question.&quot;Â  Id.Â  If there is conflicting evidence as to\r\n  whether a claimant knew or should have known he or she had a cause of action,\r\n  the question is one for the jury.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of\r\n    God, 341 S.C. 320, 338-39, 354 S.E.2d 672, 681-82 (2000).Â  &quot;One\r\n  purpose of a statute of limitations is 'to relieve the courts of the burden of\r\n  trying stale claims when a plaintiff has slept on his rights.'&quot;Â  Moates\r\n    v. Bobb, 322 S.C. 172, 176, 470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996) (quoting McKinney\r\n      v. CSX Transp., Inc., 298 S.C. 47, 49-50, 378 S.E.2d 69, 70 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989)).Â  &quot;Another purpose of the statute of limitations is to protect\r\n  potential defendants from protracted fear of litigation.&quot;Â  Moates,\r\n  322 S.C. at 176, 470 S.E.2d at 404.\r\nHowever, &quot;[i]n South Carolina, a defendant may be estopped\r\n  from claiming the statute of limitations as a defense if some conduct or\r\n  representation by the defendant has induced the plaintiff to delay in filing\r\n  suit.&quot;Â  Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 360,\r\n  559 S.E.2d 327, 338 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;An inducement for delay may consist\r\n  of either an express representation that the claim will be settled without\r\n  litigation or other conduct that suggests a lawsuit is not necessary.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  An intentional misrepresentation is not required for the application of\r\n  equitable estoppel.Â  Id. at 361, 559 S.E.2d at 339.Â  &quot;It is\r\n  sufficient if the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the words or conduct of the\r\n  defendant in allowing the limitations period to expire.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Whether the defendant's actions lulled the plaintiff into a false sense of\r\n  security is usually a question of fact; however, summary judgment is proper if\r\n  there is no evidence of conduct on the defendant's part warranting estoppel.Â  Id. at 361, 559 S.E.2d at 339.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe &quot;elements of equitable estoppel as to the party estopped\r\n  are: (1) conduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false representation\r\n  or concealment of material facts; (2) the intention that such conduct shall be\r\n  acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of\r\n  the true facts.&quot;Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580,\r\n  589, 553 S.E.2d 110, 114 (2001).Â  Estoppel may apply against a government\r\n  agency, but &quot;the party asserting estoppel against the government must\r\n  prove: (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to\r\n  the facts in question; (2) justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct;\r\n  and (3) a prejudicial change in position.&quot;Â  Am. Legion Post 15 v. Horry\r\n    County, 381 S.C. 576, 584, 674 S.E.2d 181, 185 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nLogan asserts the Board should have been estopped from asserting\r\n  the statute of limitations as a defense because it misled him by denying it had\r\n  any involvement with the manhole cover that resulted in his injury.Â  Logan\r\n  claims he filed suit against only Cherokee based on the Board's representations\r\n  that (1) the paving company was responsible for placing the risers on the\r\n  manholes and paving to the height of the manholes; and (2) the Board would have\r\n  created a work order if any work had been done to the Spring Street manholes\r\n  and no work order could be found.Â  Therefore, he maintains the Board's actions\r\n  created a genuine issue of material fact, and summary judgment was\r\n  inappropriate.\r\nSome time prior to the hearing on the Board's motion to dismiss,\r\n  Logan took the depositions of six of the Board's employees, and the owner of\r\n  Cherokee Landscaping.Â  Kimberly Fortner, the Assistant Manager and Operations\r\n  Engineer at the Board, stated in her deposition that she could not find any\r\n  record of a repair, installation, modification, change, or any kind of work\r\n  done on a manhole cover, manhole cover ring, or the sewer system on Spring\r\n  Street at any time after October 2002.Â  She also said anything to do with\r\n  manholes, manhole covers, and the sewer system falls solely within the province\r\n  and responsibility of the Board.\r\nIn his deposition, Donnie Hardin, the Board's general manager,\r\n  stated the Board is the only entity in the city responsible for the sewer\r\n  system.Â  Hardin asserted they had searched their records and did not find any\r\n  records pertaining to sewer work on Spring Street.Â  He added it was the Board's\r\n  standard procedure to make a record of any sewer work completed; however, he\r\n  could not positively say the procedure had been followed in this instance.Â  He\r\n  stated the Board is not responsible for paving streets.Â  Hardin explained the\r\n  city notifies the Board when it paves a road, and before the paving begins, the\r\n  Board verifies the manholes correspond with what is intended to be the final\r\n  level of the road.\r\nTommy Couch, who was the water and sewer superintendant in 2002,\r\n  testified during his deposition that he would know if any maintenance had been\r\n  done on the manholes in the area, and he was not aware of any work having being\r\n  done on Spring Street.Â  However, Couch stated the Board did not actually\r\n  install the manhole risers.Â  He said the Board delivered the risers to the\r\n  paving company, and the pavers installed the risers as they paved the street. \r\nBob Green, an employee in the sewer and water division, also\r\n  stated in his deposition that the Board's procedure in 2002 was to deliver the\r\n  manhole risers to the paving company to install.Â  However, in his affidavit,\r\n  Green stated he had received a call from Couch that a resident had complained\r\n  about a manhole on Spring Street after the street had been paved.Â  When Green\r\n  inspected the manhole, he discovered it was &quot;dished-down&quot; and needed\r\n  to be fixed by chipping out around the manhole, installing a new riser ring,\r\n  and patching around the manhole.Â  Green did not have the appropriate equipment with\r\n  him to make the repairs, so he told Couch what repairs were needed, and Couch\r\n  told him he sent someone to make the repairs.\r\nMatt Sellers, who was hired in 2005 as the water and sewer\r\n  superintendant, said in his deposition it was the Board's procedure to deliver\r\n  the manhole risers to the subcontractor for it to install.\r\nWade Hampton, the Board's coordinator of construction, stated\r\n  during his deposition that there was a one-inch deep hole in the road when\r\n  Cherokee was finished paving the street.Â  He said he heard Couch call Green to\r\n  fix the hole, but he did not know if it was repaired.Â  However, he also made\r\n  the following statement:\r\n\r\n\tWe went out there and cut a little circle around chipping the\r\n  asphalt out around the manhole and set a two-inch riser on it, and we didn't go\r\n  back to asphalt around it like we're supposed to . . . because it wasn't the\r\n  right riser, but it was sticking up about an inch high, which it's not supposed\r\n  to be.Â  \r\n\r\nJames Brown, the owner of Cherokee Landscaping, stated during his\r\n  deposition that he contacts the Board when they pave a road, and the Board delivers\r\n  the rings for the manholes.Â  He said Green came to Spring Street while they were\r\n  paving, but he did not have a riser to fit the manhole.Â  Brown stated when\r\n  Cherokee does not have a riser for a manhole, it dishes the road around the\r\n  manhole, and someone returns later to cut the pavement and install the correct\r\n  ring.Â  He said it is not his responsibility to return to cut around the manhole\r\n  if the Board does not have a ring to fit the manhole while they are paving.Â  In\r\n  this case, Brown said the road dipped around the manhole when he left the job.\r\nThe exercise of reasonable diligence means an injured party must\r\n  act with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of the injury would\r\n  put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that a claim against\r\n  another party might exist.Â  Hedgepath, 348 S.C. at 355, 559 S.E.2d at 336.Â \r\n  Logan's complaint stated his injury occurred on January 23, 2003, when his\r\n  front-end loader struck a manhole.Â  In his memorandum in opposition to the\r\n  Board's motion to dismiss, Logan's attorney stated he spoke with Hardin, the\r\n  Board's general manager, on October 14, 2004.Â  During their conversation,\r\n  Hardin told Logan's counsel that &quot;the Board was responsible for all sewer\r\n  work done in Gaffney, but the Board did not pave roads, although they may have\r\n  raised the manhole cover prior to paving but only to the height that the paving\r\n  contractor specified.&quot;Â  Therefore, the statute of limitations most likely\r\n  began to run on January 23, 2003, the date of Logan's injury, and at the\r\n  latest, the statute of limitations began to run on October 14, 2004, when Logan\r\n  discovered the Board was responsible for all sewer work and may have worked on\r\n  the manhole that caused his injuries.Â  Furthermore, in its answer, dated March\r\n  20, 2006, Cherokee asserted the Board was liable for any injuries suffered by\r\n  Logan.Â  Considering all of this, Logan did not file his amended complaint\r\n  against the Board until August 22, 2007, a little more than four and a half\r\n  years after the accident.Â  \r\nWe sympathize with Logan because he has suffered a terrible\r\n  injury; however, it appears the Board did not do anything to intentionally\r\n  mislead Logan into believing it did not have any involvement with the manhole\r\n  cover that resulted in Logan's injury.Â  Hardin told Logan's attorney the Board\r\n  was responsible for all manholes in Gaffney; Logan did not present any evidence\r\n  the Board's FOIA request response was false or misleading; and although there\r\n  was conflicting testimony, none of the depositions taken by Logan contradict\r\n  Hardin's statements to his attorney or the Board's FOIA response.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find Logan is not entitled to the application of equitable estoppel in this\r\n  case, and because Logan did not timely bring this action against the Board, we\r\n  affirm the trial court's order dismissing Logan's claims against the Board.\r\nLogan also argues the trial court erred in granting the Board's\r\n  motion to dismiss because discovery was not complete.Â  We find this issue is\r\n  not preserved for our review.\r\nAt the\r\n  December 2007 hearing, Logan made the incomplete discovery argument to the\r\n  trial court in response to Cherokee's motion for summary judgment.Â  Logan's\r\n  attorney argued Cherokee's motion was premature because he had just discovered\r\n  additional information and he needed &quot;to talk to some additional workers\r\n  and we need to get some response to our discovery from the [B]oard.&quot;Â \r\n  However, when the court asked Logan's attorney about the witness he thought was\r\n  relevant, he replied, &quot;we don't know yet if we have a witness because we\r\n  haven't got any response from the [B]oard to our discovery.&quot;Â  The court then\r\n  denied Cherokee's motion for summary judgment after asking Logan's attorney if\r\n  he was &quot;making a reasonable representation that there [was] some other\r\n  witness out there that [he thought was] relevant,&quot; and Logan's attorney\r\n  replied in the affirmative.\r\nAt the same hearing, after the judge had ruled on Cherokee's\r\n  motion, the Board argued its motion to dismiss.Â  In Logan's memorandum in\r\n  opposition to the Board's motion to dismiss and during the hearing, Logan\r\n  argued the Board should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations.Â \r\n  Logan did not again mention that discovery was incomplete.Â  After the hearing,\r\n  the court granted the Board's motion to dismiss, finding Logan had failed to\r\n  commence suit against the Board within the two-year statute of limitations, and\r\n  failed to offer any evidence that would estop the Board from asserting the\r\n  two-year deadline for bringing the action.Â  Logan did not file a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to reconsider.Â  Therefore, because Logan did not argue the\r\n  Board's motion to dismiss should be denied because discovery was incomplete, we\r\n  find this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;); State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694\r\n  (2003) (holding a party may not argue one set of grounds below and alternate\r\n  grounds on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  During the accident, Logan suffered ruptured disks\r\n  at C3-4 and C4-5, which resulted in a two-level fusion, spinal cord damage, and\r\n  partial paralysis of his right hand, arm, and leg.\r\n[3]Â  At some point, Cherokee filed a motion for summary\r\n  judgment; however, the motion was not included in the record on appeal.\r\n[4]Â  On appeal, Logan argues the Rule 12(b)(6) motion was\r\n  converted into a motion for summary judgment because the trial court considered\r\n  matters outside of the amended complaint by undertaking to determine when the\r\n  statute of limitations began.Â  Therefore, Logan asserts this case must be\r\n  reviewed as a grant of a motion for summary judgment, and not as grant of a\r\n  motion to dismiss.Â  Summary judgment should only be granted when there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.Â  Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348\r\n  S.C. 340, 354, 559 S.E.2d 327, 335 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;Summary judgment is\r\n  not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable\r\n  to clarify the application of the law.&quot;Â  Id. at 355, 559 S.E.2d at\r\n  335.Â  &quot;However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on\r\n  which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.&quot;Â  Id. at 355, 559 S.E.2d at 336.Â  We agree with Logan that the trial court\r\n  considered more than just the face of the complaint in determining when the\r\n  statute of limitations began; however, under either standard of review, we\r\n  still reach the same result.\r\n[5] The South Carolina Tort Claims Act further provides\r\n  the limitations period is extended an additional year, for a total of three\r\n  years, when the claimant files a verified claim within one year of the loss or\r\n  injury.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-80, -100(a) (2005).Â  Logan did not present any\r\n  evidence that he filed a verified claim; therefore, the applicable statute of\r\n  limitations is two years.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4728","title":"State v.

The court also found Latimore was not entitled to a directed verdict based on his claim that he did not receive actual notice of the change in registration requirements pursuant to the amended registration statute because the State is not required to inform sexual offenders of their duty to reregister, and moreover, the statute's plain language does not require a knowing or intentional violation of the registration requirement to be subject to punishment.  Last, the court of appeals found the trial court properly exercised its discretion in excluding a probation agent's testimony.","date":"2010-08-18","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The State, Respondent,\r\n        v.\r\n        Reginald R.\r\n          Latimore, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Greenville County\r\nÂ C.

(2) failed to grant a\r\n  directed verdict, despite the State's failure to prove Latimore received notice\r\n  of a new reporting requirement for sex offender registration; and (3) excluded\r\n  a probation agent's testimony.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2004, Latimore pled guilty to committing a lewd act\r\n  upon a child.Â  Upon his release from the Department of Corrections in 2005, he\r\n  was required under the Sex Offender Registry Act[1] to register as a sex offender with the Greenville County's Sheriff's Office.Â \r\n  As a result, Latimore registered on August 3, 2005.Â  Latimore acknowledged that\r\n  he was required to register each year for life within thirty days after the\r\n  anniversary date of his last registration.Â  Moreover, Latimore signed a notice\r\n  form at that time, which stated Latimore &quot;MUST send written notice of a\r\n  change in address to the county Sheriff's Office within ten days of\r\n  establishing [his] new residence . . . .&quot; (emphasis in original).Â  Latimore\r\n  signed an annual registration requirement form, which required his annual\r\n  registration for 2006 to be completed no later than September 3, 2006.Â  \r\nIn July 2006, the Legislature amended section 23-3-460\r\n  of the South Carolina Code[2] to require offenders to register twice a year--in their birth month as well as\r\n  six months after their birth month.Â  Pursuant to the amended statute, Latimore\r\n  was not required to register until January 1, 2007.Â  When Latimore\r\n  failed to register with the Sheriff's Office in September 2006, a warrant was\r\n  issued for his arrest.Â  Latimore was subsequently stopped for a traffic\r\n  violation in January 2007, and the police arrested him for failing to register\r\n  as a sex offender.Â  Â \r\nPrior to the commencement of Latimore's trial for\r\n  failing to register as a sex offender, the State stipulated not to mention\r\n  Latimore's conviction for commission of a lewd act upon a child.Â  Despite this\r\n  stipulation, the circuit court mentioned Latimore's conviction when it read the\r\n  indictment to the jury and during the jury charge.\r\nDuring\r\n  trial, Latimore contended he called Beverly Pettit, the Greenville County sex\r\n  offender registry coordinator, in February 2006 to obtain approval to move into\r\n  a new home.Â  Latimore testified Ms. Pettit informed him she had all the\r\n  required information from him, and his phone call to her satisfied his\r\n  registration requirements for 2006.Â  Ms. Pettit stated she did not remember\r\n  Latimore calling her, but she acknowledged his file had been pulled in February\r\n  2006 and a new address was inserted in place of the address on file from\r\n  Latimore's initial registration in August 2005.Â  Latimore stated he was under\r\n  the belief his phone call to Ms. Pettit in February 2006 prior to his required\r\n  registration date on September 3, 2006, was sufficient for registration\r\n  purposes.Â  \r\nAfter Latimore\r\n  testified, he sought to introduce the testimony of probation agent, R.J.\r\n  Gilbert.Â  The circuit court found Gilbert's testimony was irrelevant and would\r\n  not be considered by the jury, but the court permitted Latimore to proffer\r\n  Gilbert's testimony outside the jury's presence.Â  Gilbert stated he did not\r\n  typically tell offenders when they should report because it was not his duty.Â \r\n  Furthermore, while he was not Latimore's probation agent, nothing in Latimore's\r\n  file indicated he was ever informed of the new law and the change in reporting\r\n  requirements.Â  After the court heard Gilbert's proffered testimony and denied\r\n  Latimore's directed verdict motion, it charged the jury on the law.Â  In its\r\n  jury charge, the circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n  Now,\r\n    ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this defendant in this case is charged with\r\n    . . . failing to register for the sex offender registry.Â  This is a statutory\r\n    offense, and Section 23-3-430 of our Code of Laws provides, among other things,\r\n    that any person residing in South Carolina who has been convicted of or pled\r\n    guilty to the offense of, among other things, committing a lewd act on a child\r\n    must register on the sex offender registry.\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  the jury exited for jury deliberations, Latimore objected to the circuit court\r\n  specifying Latimore's conviction in its jury charge in light of the parties'\r\n  stipulation not to mention it and requested a mistrial.Â  The circuit court\r\n  denied his motion and sentenced Latimore to ninety days of house arrest.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nOn appeal,Latimore\r\n  presents three claims of error.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)\r\n    The circuit court erred in denying his motion for a\r\n  mistrial after it instructed the jury that Latimore was convicted of committing\r\n  a lewd act on a child, despite a pre-trial stipulation not to disclose\r\n  Latimore's conviction to the jury.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (2)\r\n    The circuit court erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict, despite the State's failure to prove\r\n  Latimore received notice of a new reporting requirement for sex offender\r\n  registration.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (3)\r\n    The circuit court erred in excluding the probation\r\n  agent's testimony.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Mistrial Motion\r\nLatimore\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the circuit\r\n  court. Â State v. Harris, 382 S.C. 107, 117, 674 S.E.2d 532, 537 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009). Â The circuit court's decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. Â Id. Â The power of the\r\n  circuit court to declare a mistrial should be used with the greatest caution\r\n  under urgent circumstances and for very plain and obvious reasons stated on the\r\n  record by the circuit court. Â State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 34, 615\r\n  S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005). Â A mistrial should only be granted when\r\n  absolutely necessary, and a defendant must show both error and resulting\r\n  prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial. Â Id.\r\nPrior\r\n  to the commencement of trial, the State stipulated not to mention Latimore's\r\n  conviction for commission of a lewd act upon a child during trial.Â  When the\r\n  jury entered the courtroom at the commencement of the trial, the circuit court\r\n  read the indictment, which stated, &quot;[O]n or about January 1st, 2007,\r\n  [Latimore] . . . failed to register for the sexual offender registry after\r\n  notice of this requirement and after having been convicted of committing a lewd\r\n  act on a child.&quot;Â  Latimore did not object.Â  Later, during the circuit\r\n  court's charge to the jury, it again stated, &quot;[A]ny person residing in\r\n  South Carolina who has been convicted of or pled guilty to the offense of,\r\n  among other things, committing a lewd act upon a child must register on the sex\r\n  offender registry.&quot;Â  After the jury exited for deliberations, Latimore\r\n  made a mistrial motion, arguing the circuit court's statement about the lewd\r\n  act tainted the jury's impression of Latimore and was therefore prejudicial to\r\n  him.Â  The circuit court denied Latimore's motion. \r\nWe\r\n  do not believe the circuit court's denial of Latimore's mistrial motion was in\r\n  error.Â  While it was unnecessary to mention Latimore's conviction for\r\n  commission of a lewd act upon a child during the reading of the indictment or\r\n  the jury charge in light of the parties' stipulation, we conclude Latimore was\r\n  not prejudiced.Â  See State v. Carrigan, 284 S.C. 610, 614, 328\r\n  S.E.2d 119, 121 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding the defendant was not prejudiced at\r\n  trial for driving under suspension and driving in violation of the Habitual\r\n  Traffic Offender Act, where circuit court unnecessarily read section of the Act\r\n  defining terms &quot;habitual offender&quot; and &quot;conviction&quot; after\r\n  defendant had stipulated to his prior adjudication as a habitual offender).Â \r\n  Moreover, his prior conviction as a sexual offender had no bearing on the\r\n  jury's determination of whether he violated his reporting requirements because\r\n  his conviction was not a fact in dispute.Â  Thus, any error in commenting on\r\n  this prior conviction was not prejudicial to Latimore.Â  See Stanley,\r\n  365 S.C. at 34, 615 S.E.2d at 460 (holding a defendant must show both error and\r\n  resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial). \r\nII. Directed Verdict Motion\r\nLatimore\r\n  claims the circuit court improperly denied his directed verdict motion.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIf\r\n  there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending\r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, the court must find the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury. Â State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). Â When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, an\r\n  appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\r\n  most favorable to the State. Â Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  The circuit\r\n  court should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a\r\n  suspicion that the accused is guilty. Â State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620,\r\n  625-26, 677 S.E.2d 603, 605-06 (2009).\r\nLatimore\r\n  was charged with violating section 23-3-470[3] of the South Carolina Code when he failed to register with the Greenville\r\n  County Sheriff's Office by January 1, 2007.Â  Latimore first contends he was not\r\n  notified of the new bi-annual registration requirements when the statute was\r\n  amended in July 2006, which violated his due process rights.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nLatimore\r\n  relies on Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225 (1957), for the\r\n  proposition that the State must prove he received actual notice of his duty to\r\n  register in order to satisfy due process.Â  In Lambert, a provision in a\r\n  municipal ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, California required all persons\r\n  convicted of a felony, whether that conviction occurred in California or\r\n  another state and was punishable as a felony in California, who remained in Los\r\n  Angeles more than five days to register as a felon with the Chief of Police. Â Id. at 226. Â The police discovered when Lambert was arrested that she had been\r\n  residing in Los Angeles for more than seven years, and while she had been\r\n  convicted of a felony, she failed to register with the Chief of Police. Â Id. Â After being convicted for failing to register, Lambert appealed to the California\r\n  Superior Court, which affirmed her conviction.Â  She then appealed to the United\r\n  States Supreme Court, arguing that the municipal ordinance, as applied, denied\r\n  her due process of law. Â Id. at 227.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the United States Supreme Court held that Lambert's conviction violated\r\n  due process because her conduct in failing to register was &quot;wholly\r\n  passive&quot; and &quot;[a]t most the ordinance is but a law enforcement\r\n  technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies . . .\r\n  .&quot; Â Id. at 228-29. Â However, the Supreme Court emphasized that in Lambert,\r\n  &quot;circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of\r\n  registration [were] completely lacking.&quot; Â Id. at 229. Â \r\nWe\r\n  find the registration ordinance in Lambert to be readily distinguishable\r\n  from the sex offender registration statute at issue in the case at hand.Â  In Lambert,\r\n  the registration requirement was a general municipal ordinance, whereas our Sex\r\n  Offender Registry Act is a statewide registration program. Â Unlike the\r\n  registration requirement in Lambert, the sex offender registration\r\n  requirement is directed at a narrow class of defendants, convicted sex\r\n  offenders, rather than all felons.Â  See State v. Bryant, 614 S.E.2d\r\n  479, 487 (N.C. 2005) (distinguishing the Supreme Court's holding in Lambert and finding North Carolina's and all other states' sex offender registration\r\n  statutes are statewide registration programs specifically directed at sex\r\n  offenders with the ultimate purpose of protecting the public). Â And, perhaps\r\n  most importantly, instead of serving as a general law enforcement device, as\r\n  the United States Supreme Court found the City of Los Angeles' felon\r\n  registration ordinance, our statute was specifically enacted as a public safety\r\n  measure based on the Legislature's determination that convicted sex offenders\r\n  pose an unacceptable risk to the general public once released from\r\n  incarceration. Â See S.C. Code Â§ 23-3-400 (2007) (stating because\r\n  &quot;[s]tatistics show that sex offenders often pose a high risk of\r\n  re-offending[,]&quot; the Sex Offender Registry Act serves to &quot;promote the\r\n  state's fundamental right to provide for the public health, welfare, and safety\r\n  of its citizens. . . .&quot;); Williams v. State, 378 S.C. 511, 515, 662\r\n  S.E.2d 615, 617-18 (Ct. App. 2008) (internal citation and quotation omitted)\r\n  (&quot;[T]he purpose of requiring registration is to protect the public from\r\n  those sex offenders who may re-offend and to aid law enforcement in solving sex\r\n  crimes.&quot;). \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we note the Legislature clearly contemplated the necessity of notifying sexual\r\n  offenders of the requirement to initially register in section 23-3-440\r\n  when it stated, &quot;The Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile\r\n  Justice, the Juvenile Parole Board, and the Department of Probation, Parole and\r\n  Pardon Services shall provide verbal and written notification to the\r\n  offender that he must register with the sheriff of the county in which he\r\n  intends to reside within one business day of his release.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Â§\r\n  23-3-440(1) (Supp. 2005 &amp; 2007) (emphasis added).Â  Had the Legislature\r\n  intended for the State to notify Latimore of the need to register bi-annually,\r\n  it could have included such language in section 23-3-460.Â  See generally Theisen v. Theisen, 382 S.C. 213, 219, 676 S.E.2d 133, 137 (2009)\r\n  (finding if the Legislature intended a statute of limitations period to apply\r\n  only to wills which were informally probated in this state, it could have\r\n  included such language in the statute); see also State v. Hackett,\r\n  363 S.C. 177, 181, 609 S.E.2d 553, 555 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;In construing a\r\n  statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's\r\n  operation.&quot;) (internal citation and quotation omitted).Â  Because no such\r\n  language was included in section 23-3-460, we find it would be improper to\r\n  construe the statute otherwise.Â  \r\nLatimore\r\n  also claims his phone call to Ms. Pettit of the Greenville County sex offender\r\n  registry in February 2006 in an effort to update his address should be deemed\r\n  sufficient to comply with the statute.Â  We disagree. \r\nWe\r\n  find the plain language of the statute controls the resolution of this issue.Â \r\n  Section 23-3-460 requires an offender to initially register and re-register\r\n  &quot;each year during the month of his birthday and again during the sixth month\r\n  following his birth month . . . at the sheriff's department in each county\r\n  where he resides.&quot; Â§ 23-3-460(A) (Supp. 2009).Â  Latimore's phone call was\r\n  insufficient to satisfy the clear mandates of section 23-3-460(A), and even if\r\n  we presume Latimore was not notified of the changes to the statutory scheme,\r\n  ignorance of the law is no excuse.Â  See Cheek v. United States,\r\n  498 U.S. 192, 199 (1991) (&quot;The general rule that ignorance of the law or a\r\n  mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the\r\n  American legal system.&quot;); South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res.\r\n    Dept. v. Kunkle, 287 S.C. 177, 178, 336 S.E.2d 468, 469 (1985) (&quot;[I]t\r\n  is a well-settled maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the State presented sufficient evidence to submit the issue of whether\r\n  Latimore failed to comply with the registration requirements to the jury.Â  See Hernandez, 382 S.C. at 625-26, 677 S.E.2d at 605-06 (holding the circuit\r\n  court should grant a directed verdict only when the evidence merely raises a\r\n  suspicion that the accused is guilty). Â Thus, we conclude the circuit court did\r\n  not err in denying Latimore's motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Exclusion of Probation\r\n  Agent's Testimony\r\nFinally,\r\n  Latimore argues the circuit court erred when it excluded the testimony of a\r\n  probation agent because this testimony would establish Latimore was never informed\r\n  of the new registration requirements.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the circuit court and will\r\n  not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Gaster, 349\r\n  S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court refused to permit R.J. Gilbert, a probation agent for Greenville\r\n  County, to testify at Latimore's trial.Â  In doing so, the court found Gilbert's\r\n  testimony was irrelevant because the probation department is not required by\r\n  law to inform offenders of changes in the sex offender registration\r\n  requirements.Â  The circuit court, however, permitted Latimore to proffer\r\n  Gilbert's testimony, and during Gilbert's proffer, he stated he was not\r\n  Latimore's probation agent, and it was not Gilbert's duty to inform offenders\r\n  of any changes in the law.Â  Gilbert said there was nothing in Latimore's file\r\n  to indicate he had ever been informed of the changes in reporting\r\n  requirements.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the circuit court's conclusion that Gilbert's testimony was\r\n  irrelevant as to whether Latimore had notice of the new registration\r\n  requirements.Â  Gilbert was not Latimore's probation agent at the time his\r\n  registration was in issue, nor was Gilbert responsible for ensuring offenders\r\n  fulfilled their registration requirements.Â  Even if the circuit court erred in\r\n  excluding Gilbert's testimony, we fail to see how Gilbert's testimony would\r\n  have satisfactorily corroborated Latimore's claim that he was unaware of proper\r\n  registration procedures.Â  See State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159,\r\n  168-69, 508 S.E.2d 870, 875 (1998) (finding exclusion of certain evidence was\r\n  proper, and moreover, any error in refusing to admit proffered testimony was\r\n  harmless when proffered testimony added little favorable evidence for\r\n  defendant).Â  As a result, Latimore was not prejudiced by the exclusion of\r\n  Gilbert's testimony.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code\r\n  sections 23-3-400 to -550 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2009).\r\n[2] Section 23-3-460(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2009) states, in pertinent part, \r\n\r\n  A person\r\n    required to register pursuant to this article is required to register\r\n    bi-annually for life.Â  For purposes of this article, &quot;bi-annually&quot;\r\n    means each year during the month of his birthday and again during the sixth\r\n    month following his birth month. Â The person required to register shall\r\n    register and must re-register at the sheriff's department in each county where\r\n    he resides . . . .\r\n\r\n[3] S.C. Code\r\n  section 23-3-470 states, &quot;It is the duty of the offender to contact the\r\n  sheriff in order to register[] [or] provide notification of change of address .\r\n  . . . If an offender fails to register[] . . . he must be punished as provided\r\n  in subsection (B).&quot;Â  Â§ 23-3-470(A) (2007). \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4729","title":"Melton v.

Driggers, Jr., of Hartsville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In\r\n  this civil case, we must determine whether the circuit court erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Dr. Jennifer Feldman (Dr. Feldman) and Columbia\r\n  Heart Clinic (collectively Respondents) on William and Ann Melton's (collectively\r\n  Appellants) causes of action for medical malpractice, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, abandonment, and intentional infliction of emotional\r\n  distress.[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliam\r\n  Melton (Melton) is a seventy-four-year-old male who resides in Winnsboro, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  In 2002, Melton had what he described as a &quot;flicker of a\r\n  blackout,&quot; which caused him to become unsteady when he stood up.Â \r\n  Following this episode, Melton visited his family physician, Dr. Manuel Venegas\r\n  (Dr. Venegas), in Chapin, South Carolina. Â After putting Melton through a\r\n  series of tests, Dr. Venegas concluded Melton did not have a serious heart\r\n  problem.Â  However, as a safety precaution, Dr. Venegas referred Melton to Dr.\r\n  Feldman, a cardiologist in Columbia, for further assessment.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Feldman arranged for Melton to have a catheterization performed on June 24, 2002.Â \r\n  Before the catheterization, Melton was given a form to sign that would\r\n  authorize Dr. Feldman to implant a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) into\r\n  Melton's heart if necessary.Â  Although Melton does not recall being told\r\n  exactly what an ICD would do or whether he actually needed one, he signed the\r\n  form.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the catheterization, Dr. Feldman informed Melton he needed to have an ICD\r\n  implanted.Â  Dr. Feldman recommended an ICD made by Medtronic, Inc.\r\n  (Medtronic).Â  On June 25, 2002, Melton signed a consent form authorizing Dr.\r\n  Feldman to implant a Medtronic Marquis ICD (the ICD) into his chest.Â  Melton\r\n  understood the purpose of the ICD was to deliver a shock to his heart if it\r\n  needed regulating.Â  However, Melton does not recall Dr. Feldman ever offering\r\n  any advice on which type of ICD she would be implanting, which ones were better\r\n  than others, or what the risks of implanting an ICD were.Â  Further, according\r\n  to Melton, when he asked Dr. Feldman how she chooses one company's ICD over\r\n  another, she responded, &quot;I choose according to which company's representative\r\n  I like the best.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  summer after Dr. Feldman implanted the ICD, the ICD delivered an unexpected\r\n  shock to Melton's heart.Â  During his next visit, Dr. Feldman told Melton the\r\n  ICD was &quot;set at the wrong speed,&quot; and so she had a nurse adjust it\r\n  accordingly.Â  Thereafter, on the morning of June 10, 2005, Melton experienced\r\n  yet another unexpected shock from the ICD as he was getting dressed.Â  Melton's\r\n  wife called for an ambulance, which took Melton to Providence Memorial\r\n  Hospital.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  some point after the June 2005 incident, during a &quot;normal defibrillator\r\n  visit,&quot; a nurse informed Melton that up to 1.5 percent of the type of\r\n  Medtronic ICDs that Melton had implanted in his chest &quot;may suffer sudden\r\n  and premature battery failure.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  According to Melton, the nurse also stated Dr. Feldman &quot;had known about\r\n  the defect for about a year but [was not] allowed to tell patients that the\r\n  battery might go dead at any moment . . . .&quot;Â  Neither the nurse nor Dr.\r\n  Feldman gave Melton any advice as to whether to replace the ICD.Â  Melton was,\r\n  however, given a copy of a &quot;Device Alert,&quot; which discussed the\r\n  potential defect, how to monitor the battery of an implanted ICD, and that the\r\n  patient had the option of having a different ICD implanted.Â  At one point, the\r\n  Device Alert reads, &quot;My signature below indicates that all of the\r\n  information above has been explained to me including the risks and benefits of\r\n  each course of action, and that I had a chance to ask questions about this\r\n  information.&quot;Â  Melton signed his name at the bottom of the Device Alert.Â  \r\nMelton\r\n  and Dr. Feldman decided to replace the ICD with one made by Guidant.Â  The\r\n  surgery to replace the ICD was scheduled for July 6, 2005.Â  Before that time,\r\n  however, Melton read in the Wall Street Journal and other publications that\r\n  Guidant, like Medtronic, was experiencing technical problems with their ICDs.Â \r\n  When Melton called Dr. Feldman's office to discuss the surgery and the other\r\n  kinds of ICDs that were available, a nurse told him Dr. Feldman was on vacation\r\n  in Australia, and &quot;if [he] wanted any information, to go to the website of\r\n  the company.&quot;Â  Upon returning from her vacation, Dr. Feldman called\r\n  Melton. Â Melton claims Dr. Feldman was upset that Melton &quot;didn't trust her\r\n  choice of putting in a Guidant,&quot; and that she said he &quot;shouldn't have\r\n  any questions about it[.]&quot;Â  Ultimately, Dr. Feldman told Melton, &quot;You\r\n  don't trust me, you need to get another doctor, . . . and don't even come back\r\n  to my group.&quot;Â  Dr. Feldman did provide Melton the name of another doctor\r\n  with the University of South Carolina; however, Melton never called that\r\n  doctor.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  commenced this action against Medtronic, Dr. Feldman, and Columbia Heart Clinic\r\n  on April 17, 2006.[3]Â \r\n  Appellants settled their claims against Medtronic.Â  As part of discovery, the\r\n  Respondents took depositions from Melton and his wife.Â  Respondents also took\r\n  depositions from three of Melton's treating physicians: his current family\r\n  physician, Dr. Venegas; his former family physician, Dr. Roger Gaddy (Dr.\r\n  Gaddy); and his current cardiologist, Dr. John Beard (Dr. Beard).Â  Neither Dr.\r\n  Feldman nor the nurse with whom Melton spoke at Columbia Heart Clinic were\r\n  deposed.Â  Dr. Feldman and Columbia Heart Clinic moved for summary judgment on\r\n  December 27, 2006.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court granted summary judgment as to all claims against the Respondents.Â \r\n  As to Melton's causes of action for medical malpractice, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, and abandonment, the circuit court held those claims were\r\n  &quot;all de facto claims for medical malpractice&quot; and, therefore, Melton\r\n  was required to provide expert testimony.Â  The circuit court found Melton\r\n  failed to produce expert testimony establishing the standard of care, breach,\r\n  and proximate causation.Â  As to Melton's cause of action for outrage or\r\n  intentional infliction of emotional distress, the circuit court found Melton\r\n  presented &quot;insufficient evidence that the conduct of [Respondents] was\r\n  outrageous in any respect.&quot;Â  As to Melton's two causes of action for\r\n  breach of warranty, the circuit court held those were products liability\r\n  claims. Accordingly, because neither of the Respondents was the\r\n  &quot;seller&quot; of the ICD, summary judgment was appropriate.Â  Finally, as\r\n  to Melton's wife's action for loss of consortium, the circuit court held\r\n  because her claim was dependent on Melton's claims, summary judgment was\r\n  appropriate.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not\r\n  require the services of a fact finder.&quot;Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354\r\n  S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003).Â  &quot;An appellate court reviews the\r\n  granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court\r\n  under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&quot;Â  Bovain v. Canal Ins., 383 S.C. 100, 105,\r\n  678 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2009).Â  &quot;Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure provides that a trial court may grant a motion for summary\r\n  judgment 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP).Â  &quot;In\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in\r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South\r\n    Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 329-30, 673 S.E.2d 801, 802 (2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Outrage/Intentional\r\n  Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nMelton\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the\r\n  Respondents on his claim for outrage.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  establish intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage, a plaintiff\r\n  must establish: (1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe\r\n  emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress\r\n  would result from his conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as\r\n  to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious, and\r\n  utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions of the defendant\r\n  caused the plaintiff's emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress\r\n  suffered by the plaintiff was so severe that no reasonable man could be\r\n  expected to endure it.Â  Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 517, 445 S.E.2d\r\n  651, 655 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  &quot;Facts which may show extreme insensitivity on\r\n  the part of the defendant do not necessarily establish the tort of outrage.&quot;Â  Hawkins v. Greene, 311 S.C. 88, 91, 427 S.E.2d 692, 694 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nWe\r\n  find no evidence in the record suggesting that Dr. Feldman or Columbia Heart\r\n  Clinic acted intentionally or recklessly to inflict severe emotional distress\r\n  on Melton.Â  Moreover, while Dr. Feldman's decision to dismiss Melton as a\r\n  patient so close to the date of his scheduled surgery was arguably insensitive,\r\n  we can hardly deem such conduct &quot;so extreme and outrageous as to exceed\r\n  all possible grounds of decency&quot; or &quot;utterly intolerable in a civilized\r\n  community,&quot; especially in light of the fact that Melton admitted Dr.\r\n  Feldman provided him with the name of another cardiologist. Â Shupe, 315\r\n  S.C. atÂ  517, 445 S.E.2d at 655.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find no error in the circuit court's grant of summary judgment on this cause\r\n  of action.[4]\r\nB. Abandonment and Medical\r\n  Malpractice\r\nMelton\r\n  argues the tort of medical abandonment is separate from and independent of the\r\n  tort of medical malpractice.Â  Consequently, he contends the circuit court erred\r\n  in characterizing his abandonment cause of action as a &quot;de facto claim[]\r\n  for medical malpractice&quot; and analyzing it under the traditional medical\r\n  malpractice framework.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  physician commits medical malpractice by not exercising that degree of skill\r\n  and learning that is ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the\r\n  profession in good standing acting in the same or similar circumstances.&quot;Â  David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006)\r\n  (citing Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 650-51, 602 S.E.2d 760, 766\r\n  (2004)).Â  &quot;[O]nce employed, a physician must attend the case as long as it\r\n  requires attention, unless the relation of physician and patient is ended by\r\n  mutual consent or is revoked by the dismissal of the physician. Â A physician\r\n  cannot abandon a case without reasonable notice to the patient.&quot;Â  Guinan\r\n    v. Tenet Healthsystems of Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 48, 56, 677 S.E.2d\r\n  32, 37 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing Johnston v. Ward, 288 S.C. 603, 610, 344\r\n  S.E.2d 166, 170 (1986)).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find no South Carolina cases explicitly recognize medical abandonment as a tort\r\n  separate from medical malpractice.Â  Melton, however, argues Johnston recognizes medical abandonment as a separate tort, and that pursuant to Johnston,\r\n  expert opinion was not necessary to establish that Dr. Feldman's abandonment of\r\n  Melton did not comport with the recognized and accepted standard of care.Â  Johnston involved wrongful death and survival actions brought by an executor against a\r\n  number of physicians and a hospital for medical malpractice after the decedent\r\n  died of a silicate overdose while at the hospital.Â  Johnston, 288 S.C.\r\n  at 605, 344 S.E.2d at 167.Â  The only issue on appeal relating to abandonment\r\n  was whether the trial court erred in allowing the psychiatrist's expert to\r\n  testify that the psychiatrist's responsibility to the decedent terminated when\r\n  the psychiatrist assigned care of the decedent to another doctor at the\r\n  hospital.Â  Id. at 610, 344 S.E.2d at 170.\r\nWe find Johnston does not recognize abandonment as a tort separate from medical\r\n  malpractice; in fact, it illustrates that abandonment is but one form of\r\n  medical malpractice.Â  First, the court recognized at the outset of its opinion\r\n  that the claim of abandonment was brought in the context of an action for\r\n  medical malpractice.Â  See Johnston, 288 S.C. at 605, 344 S.E.2d\r\n  at 167 (&quot;These wrongful death and survival actions . . . involve\r\n  allegations of medical malpractice.&quot;)Â  Second, expert testimony is\r\n  required in cases involving medical malpractice claims.Â  See David,\r\n  367 S.C. at 248, 626 S.E.2d at 3.Â  Thus, the fact that the testimony regarding\r\n  abandonment in Johnston came from an expert witness suggests that the\r\n  claim for abandonment was merely part of the more general claim for medical\r\n  malpractice.\r\nA\r\n  review of cases from other jurisdictions reveals medical abandonment is but one\r\n  form of medical malpractice and that claims for medical abandonment are\r\n  properly analyzed under the traditional medical malpractice framework.Â  See Granek v. Texas St. Bd. of Med. Examiners, 172 S.W.3d 761, 766 n.2 (Tex.\r\n  App. 2005) (&quot;Patient abandonment is a form of breach of duty in a medical\r\n  malpractice action.&quot;); Bradford v. Rossi, 548 S.E.2d 70, 71 (Ga.\r\n  App. 2001) (&quot;A claim of abandonment, which is a tort, amounts to the same\r\n  as negligent treatment.Â  As such, the claim requires that the plaintiff file an\r\n  expert affidavit.&quot;) (internal quotations and footnotes omitted); Lewis\r\n    v. Capalbo, 720 N.Y.S.2d 455, 457 (N.Y. App. Div. 2001) (&quot;It is well\r\n  established that a doctor who undertakes to examine and treat a patient (thus\r\n  creating a doctor-patient relationship) and then abandons the patient may be\r\n  held liable for medical malpractice.&quot;) (citation omitted); Norton v.\r\n    Hamilton, 89 S.E.2d 809, 812 (Ga. App. 1955) (&quot;If a physician abandons\r\n  a case without giving such notice or providing a competent physician in his\r\n  place, it is a failure to exercise that care required by law, which failure\r\n  amounts to a tort.&quot;). \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we find the reasoning of Linog v. Yamplonksy, 376 S.C. 182, 656 S.E.2d\r\n  355 (2008) applicable to the present situation.Â  In that case, our supreme\r\n  court was asked to decide &quot;whether South Carolina should recognize a\r\n  separate and independent cause of action for medical battery, or whether such\r\n  theories of liability are more properly analyzed under alternative and\r\n  well-established causes of action.&quot;Â  Id. at 187-88, 656 S.E.2d at\r\n  358.Â  The supreme court held it should not, stating:\r\n\r\n  We see\r\n    little need to recognize an additional cause of action related to tortious\r\n    injuries arising out of interactions with medical providers when the tort of\r\n      medical malpractice fully covers all acts performed in relation to medical\r\n      services and when the remaining area of private tort law applies to acts\r\n    not related to medical services.\r\n\r\nId. at 187, 656 S.E.2d at 358 (emphasis added).\r\nMedical\r\n  abandonment, like medical battery, would &quot;constitute an unnecessary and\r\n  superfluous cause of action.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Consequently, medical abandonment\r\n  should be analyzed as a medical malpractice claim because the act of improperly\r\n  terminating the doctor-patient relationship logically fits into the more\r\n  general category of &quot;not exercising that degree of skill and learning that\r\n  is ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the profession in good\r\n  standing acting in the same or similar circumstances.&quot;Â  David, 367\r\n  S.C. at 247, 626 S.E.2d at 3. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find no error in the circuit court's ruling that Melton's claim for\r\n  abandonment is a &quot;de facto claim[] for medical malpractice.&quot;\r\nC. Medical Malpractice\r\nMelton\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dr.\r\n  Feldman on his medical malpractice claims because he presented sufficient\r\n  evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to that cause of\r\n  action.Â  We disagree.\r\nMedical\r\n  malpractice lawsuits have specific requirements that must be satisfied in order\r\n  for a genuine issue of material fact to exist.Â  David, 367 S.C. at 247,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 3.Â  Specifically, a patient alleging medical malpractice must\r\n  provide evidence, through expert testimony, showing (1) the generally\r\n  recognized and accepted practices and procedures that would be followed by\r\n  average, competent practitioners in the physician's field of medicine under the\r\n  same or similar circumstances, and (2) that the physician departed from the\r\n  recognized and generally accepted standards.Â  Id. at 247, 626 S.E.2d at\r\n  4.Â  Additionally, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's departure from\r\n  such generally recognized practices and procedures was the proximate cause of\r\n  his alleged injuries and damages.Â  Id. at 248, 626 S.E.2d at 4.Â  \r\nExpert\r\n  testimony need not come from a specialist in the same field as the defendant.Â  See Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 253, 487 S.E.2d 596,\r\n  598 (1997) (&quot;Defects in an expert witness' education and experience go to\r\n  the weight, rather than the admissibility, of the expert's testimony&quot;); Creed\r\n    v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 345, 426 S.E.2d 785, 786 (1993) (&quot;A\r\n  physician is not incompetent to testify merely because he is not a specialist\r\n  in the particular branch of his profession involved.&quot;).Â  However,\r\n  &quot;[r]egardless of the area in which the prospective expert witness\r\n  practices, he must set forth the applicable standard of care for the medical\r\n  procedure under scrutiny and he must demonstrate to the court that he is\r\n  familiar with the standard of care.&quot;Â  David, 367 S.C. at 250, 626\r\n  S.E.2d at 5.Â  Further, if the expert merely testifies as to his own personal standard of care, rather than the generally recognized and accepted standard of\r\n  care, such testimony is insufficient to survive summary judgment.Â  See Guinan,\r\n  383 S.C. at 57, 677 S.E.2d at 37-38 (holding expert's testimony was\r\n  insufficient to survive summary judgment because the testimony, at most, showed\r\n  the defendant deviated from the expert's personal standard of care rather than the\r\n  generally recognized and accepted standard of care).\r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing Melton's arguments, we distill five instances in which he believes\r\n  Dr. Feldman's conduct departed from the recognized standard of care: (1)\r\n  failing to properly apprise Melton of the risks involved in implanting an ICD;\r\n  (2) implanting a defective ICD; (3) using improper criteria to select the ICD\r\n  from among other available models; (4) failing to inform Melton of the defect\r\n  in the ICD and remove it in a timely manner; and (5) abandoning Melton on the\r\n  &quot;eve of surgery.&quot;Â  We analyze each argument in turn.\r\n1. Failure to properly advise\r\n  of risks\r\nMelton\r\n  first argues Dr. Feldman committed malpractice by failing to properly inform\r\n  him of the risks before implanting the ICD.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  the doctrine of informed consent, a physician who performs a diagnostic,\r\n  therapeutic, or surgical procedure has a duty to disclose to a patient of sound\r\n  mind, in the absence of an emergency that warrants immediate medical treatment,\r\n  (1) the diagnosis, (2) the general nature of the contemplated procedure, (3)\r\n  the material risks involved in the procedure, (4) the probability of success\r\n  associated with the procedure, (5) the prognosis if the procedure is not\r\n  carried out, and (6) the existence of any alternatives to the procedure. Â Hook\r\n    v. Rothstein, 281 S.C. 541, 547, 316 S.E.2d 690, 694-95 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The\r\n  basis of the doctrine is the patient's right to exercise control over his or\r\n  her own body by deciding intelligently for himself or herself whether or not to\r\n  submit to the particular procedure.Â  Id. at 547-48, 316 S.E.2d at 695.Â \r\n  &quot;[T]he scope of a physician's duty to disclose is measured by those\r\n  communications a reasonable medical practitioner in the same branch of medicine\r\n  would make under the same or similar circumstances.&quot; Id. at 553,\r\n  316 S.E.2d at 698.\r\n&quot;An\r\n  informed consent action is no different from any other action for professional\r\n  malpractice.&quot;Â  Id. at 551, 316 S.E.2d at 696.Â  A plaintiff must\r\n  ordinarily establish the professional standard governing the scope of a\r\n  physician's duty to inform a patient of the material risks inherent in a\r\n  proposed treatment or procedure by expert medical evidence.Â  Id. at 551,\r\n  316 S.E.2d at 697.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Melton failed to present evidence as to what was required of Dr.\r\n  Feldman under the accepted and recognized standard of care governing informed\r\n  consent between a cardiologist and patient.Â  Neither Dr. Gaddy, Dr. Venegas,\r\n  nor Dr. Beard testified as to what a cardiologist in Dr. Feldman's position\r\n  should have done under the circumstances in terms of disclosure.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Melton failed to provide evidence that Dr. Feldman's failure to apprise him of\r\n  the risks of ICD implantation was the proximate cause of his injuries.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Melton did not testify that, if he had been apprised of the risks, he would\r\n  have chosen not to have an ICD implanted.Â  See Hanselmann v. McCardle,\r\n  275 S.C. 46, 48-49, 267 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1980) (&quot;Negligence is not\r\n  actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the injuries, and it may be deemed\r\n  a proximate cause only when without such negligence the injury would not have\r\n  occurred or could have been avoided.&quot;).Â  When asked whether he would have\r\n  changed his decision to have the ICD implanted if Dr. Feldman had &quot;sat\r\n  [him] down and went through all the details of the operation,&quot; Melton\r\n  replied, &quot;I don't know because it didn't happen . . . I guess it would\r\n  depend on what I heard.&quot;Â  \r\nConsequently,\r\n  Melton failed to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Dr. Feldman's\r\n  failure to apprise him of the risks involved in implanting the ICD constituted\r\n  malpractice.\r\n2. Implanting a Defective ICD\r\nRespondents\r\n  argue the expert testimony in this case was insufficient to establish either (1)\r\n  the standard of care for cardiologists implanting ICDs, or (2) that the ICD was\r\n  defective.Â  We agree.\r\nDr.\r\n  Gaddy testified, &quot;I don't put pacemakers in and . . . I'm not a\r\n  cardiologist.&quot;Â  Further, when Dr. Gaddy was asked whether he was going to\r\n  render &quot;any opinions as to whether or not Dr. Feldman deviated from the\r\n  standard of care as a cardiologist in rendering any treatment to the plaintiff\r\n  in this case,&quot;Â  he responded:\r\n\r\n  No, I\r\n    don't think that I would.Â  I mean, I'm not a cardiologist. \r\n  . . .\r\n  I think\r\n    it would be inappropriate for me to, just as it would be inappropriate for\r\n    radiologists to or urologists or anybody else of the same specialty.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  Dr. Venegas testified that as a family physician, he does not implant\r\n  pacemakers and he would defer to the knowledge of a cardiologist on that\r\n  issue.Â  When Dr. Venegas was asked if he believed Dr. Feldman deviated from the\r\n  standard of care in her treatment of Mr. Melton, he responded, &quot;I cannot\r\n  see where from the note[s] that I've been given from [Dr. Feldman] that she\r\n  deviated from the standard of care in her medical treatment of Mr.\r\n  Melton.&quot;Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Gaddy and Dr. Venegas[5] failed to establish the standard of care for implanting ICDs, and therefore,\r\n  their testimony was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.Â  See Botehlo v. Bycura, 282 S.C. 578, 587, 320 S.E.2d 59, 65 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (holding expert testimony by an orthopedic surgeon in a case of alleged medical\r\n  malpractice by a podiatrist failed to create a genuine issue of material fact\r\n  because (1) the material question in the case was the standard required of\r\n  podiatrists, not orthopedic surgeons, (2) the witness admitted he was not\r\n  familiar with the procedure the defendant performed, and (3) when the\r\n  orthopedic surgeon was asked if he held himself out as an expert, he answered,\r\n  &quot;No, not in podiatry, no&quot;).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Melton presented no evidence that the battery in the ICD was defective.Â  If\r\n  anything, his testimony suggests the battery in the ICD device was working too\r\n  well; the ICD activated at times when he believed his heart rate was normal. Â At\r\n  one point, Melton testified that the battery powering the ICD &quot;never\r\n  malfunctioned between the date that it was implanted and the date it was\r\n  explanted.&quot;Â  Further, to the extent the ICD was &quot;defective&quot; in\r\n  the sense that it was prone to over-activation, Melton also failed to present\r\n  evidence that Dr. Feldman or Columbia Heart Clinic knew this at the time Dr.\r\n  Feldman implanted the ICD.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Melton failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dr.\r\n  Feldman's implantation of the ICD, in and of itself, constituted malpractice.\r\n3. Improper Criteria for\r\n  Selecting the ICD\r\nRespondents\r\n  contend even assuming, arguendo, the expert testimony on this issue\r\n  establishes both the standard of care and a breach of that standard, summary\r\n  judgment was nevertheless proper because Melton failed to present evidence of a\r\n  causal link between Feldman's selection criteria and Melton's injuries.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Gaddy was asked whether it would ever be proper for a physician to base the\r\n  selection of a particular medical device on how much the physician liked the\r\n  manufacturer's sales representative, he answered, &quot;I never use that [as a\r\n  criterion].&quot; Â This testimony is insufficient to create a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact because it only shows Dr. Feldman departed from Dr. Gaddy's\r\n  personal standard of care; it does not show Dr. Feldman departed from the\r\n  generally accepted standard of care.Â  See Guinan, 383 S.C. at 57,\r\n  677 S.E.2d at 37-38 (holding expert's testimony was insufficient to survive\r\n  summary judgment because the testimony, at most, showed the defendant deviated\r\n  from the expert's personal standard of care rather than the generally accepted\r\n  standard of care).\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Venegas was asked the same question, however, he stated, &quot;Definitely\r\n  not, definitely not.&quot;Â  Instead, Dr. Venegas testified it would be proper\r\n  for a physician considering a medical device or drug to evaluate it based on\r\n  &quot;[t]he benefits outweighing the risks, the appropriateness of the\r\n  situation . . . the various side effects, risks, alternatives.&quot;Â  Arguably,\r\n  this testimony constitutes evidence of both the generally accepted standard of\r\n  care and a breach thereof.Â  \r\nUltimately,\r\n  however, we need not decide whether the expert testimony establishes the\r\n  standard of care or breach because Melton presented no evidence showing that\r\n  Dr. Feldman's selection criteria was the proximate cause of his injuries.Â  See David, 367 S.C. at 248, 626 S.E.2d at 4 (holding the plaintiff must show\r\n  that the defendant's departure from such generally recognized practices and\r\n  procedures was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's alleged injuries and\r\n  damages).Â  See also Tumblin v. Ball-Incon Glass Packaging Corp., 324\r\n  S.C. 359, 365, 478 S.E.2d 81, 84 (Ct. App. 1996)Â  (holding expert testimony is\r\n  generally required to establish proximate cause in medical malpractice cases).Â \r\n  Specifically, Melton failed to present evidence showing that, had Dr. Feldman\r\n  employed different selection criteria, either (1) it would have led her to\r\n  choose a different ICD, or (2) that a different ICD would not have caused him\r\n  the same or similar problems.Â  Hanselmann, 275 S.C. at 48-49, 267 S.E.2d\r\n  at 533 (&quot;Negligence is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of\r\n  the injuries, and it may be deemed a proximate cause only when without such\r\n  negligence the injury would not have occurred or could have been avoided.&quot;).Â  \r\n Accordingly, Melton\r\n  failed to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Melton's selection\r\n  criteria constituted medical malpractice.\r\n4. Failure to Timely Inform of\r\n  Defect\r\nHere\r\n  again, Respondents argue even if the expert testimony establishes that Dr.\r\n  Feldman's failure to inform Melton of the potential defect in the ICD was a\r\n  breach of the generally accepted standard of care, there is no evidence\r\n  establishing that Dr. Feldman's failure to inform Melton of the potentially\r\n  defective battery was the proximate cause of any of Melton's alleged injuries.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Gaddy was asked, &quot;Would it be an acceptable practice for a physician\r\n  to wait over a year to inform a patient [that his ICD has the potential to fail\r\n  without warning][,]&quot; he responded:\r\n\r\n  I would\r\n    not think that would be appropriate.Â  I mean, I think any time you have the\r\n    potential of a problem with a device . . ., then I think it's incumbent upon\r\n    [the physician] to make them aware of it.\r\n  . . . \r\n  I think\r\n    [the physician] ought to let [the patient] know as soon as they are aware of\r\n    it.\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Venegas and Dr. Beard were asked the same question, they responded,\r\n  &quot;That would be a long time,&quot; and &quot;A year would be a little\r\n  long,&quot; respectively. Thus, as with the testimony regarding the selection\r\n  criteria, the testimony from the physicians arguably establishes that waiting a\r\n  year to inform Melton was a departure from the generally recognized standard of\r\n  care for any physician.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  Melton presented no evidence establishing that Dr. Feldman's failure to inform\r\n  Melton of the potential defect was the proximate cause of his injuries.Â  None\r\n  of the three experts testified that, in their professional opinion, Melton's\r\n  injuries resulted from Dr. Feldman's failure to inform Melton of the defect.Â  See Martasin v. Hilton Head Health System, 364 S.C. 430, 438, 613 S.E.2d\r\n  795, 799-800 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 125,\r\n  473 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1996)) (&quot;When one relies solely upon the opinion of\r\n  medical experts to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence\r\n  and the injury, the expert must, with reasonable certainty, state that in their\r\n  professional opinion, the injuries complained of most probably resulted from\r\n  the defendant's negligence.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Melton testified that his injuries in this case derived, in part, from his\r\n  inability to engage in his normal activities due to the fear that the ICD would\r\n  discharge unexpectedly.Â  However, this &quot;injury&quot; is ostensibly shared,\r\n  in varying degrees, by everyone who has an ICD implanted in his or her, even a\r\n  properly functioning one.[6]Â \r\n  Consequently, even if Dr. Feldman had informed Melton of the potential defect\r\n  in a timely manner and replaced the ICD with a properly functioning one, the\r\n  possibility of an unexpected discharge would still loom, thereby leaving Melton\r\n  in much the same state in which he now finds himself.Â  Therefore, a jury could not\r\n  have reasonably inferred a causal connection between Dr. Feldman's failure to\r\n  inform and Melton's alleged injuries.Â  See Green v. Lilliewood,\r\n  272 S.C. 186, 191, 249 S.E.2d 910, 912 (1978) (holding when both expert\r\n  testimony and circumstantial evidence of a physician's culpability are\r\n  presented, the inquiry is whether there was sufficient competent evidence from\r\n  which the jury may have inferred a causal connection).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Melton failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dr.\r\n  Feldman's failure to inform him of the defect in the ICD constituted\r\n  malpractice.\r\n5. Abandonment\r\nRespondents\r\n  argue Melton failed to produce evidence of the standard for dismissing a patient,\r\n  breach, or proximate causation.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Gaddy was asked whether it would be acceptable to &quot;simply terminate\r\n  the [doctor-patient] relationship without any notice,&quot; he responded,\r\n  &quot;I think it depends a lot on the circumstances around it, but I think that\r\n  the best way to do it is to give them an option if they feel like . . . they're\r\n  going to terminate the professional relationship.&quot;Â  Further, when asked\r\n  whether a physician has a responsibility to help the patient locate a new\r\n  health care provider, he responded, &quot;[W]hat I've done in the past [is] I\r\n  usually give them the names of three doctors, that I know . . . .&quot;Â  At\r\n  best, Dr. Gaddy's testimony establishes only his personal standard of care in\r\n  terminating the doctor-patient relationship, rather than the generally\r\n  recognized and accepted standard of care.Â  As noted above, such testimony is\r\n  insufficient to survive summary judgment.Â  Guinan, 383 S.C. at 57, 677\r\n  S.E.2d at 37-38.\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Venegas was asked whether terminating a doctor-patient relationship two\r\n  days before scheduled surgery would be proper, he responded, &quot;That would\r\n  not be common.&quot; When asked whether a doctor should give thirty days notice\r\n  to a patient prior to termination and attempt to find another doctor for the\r\n  patient, Dr. Venegas stated it would be &quot;common practice,&quot; to do\r\n  that, but that it was not &quot;written in stone,&quot; and was not &quot;the\r\n  standard for all physicians in South Carolina.&quot;Â  We find this testimony\r\n  falls short of establishing the standard of care for terminating the doctor-patient\r\n  relationship.\r\nFinally,\r\n  when Dr. Beard was asked what the proper procedure for terminating a\r\n  doctor-patient relationship, he responded, &quot;I'll tell you how I do it, and\r\n  it varies probably from individual to individual.Â  But I personally like a face-to-face\r\n  encounter . . . .&quot;Â  Again, this testimony only established Dr. Beard's\r\n  personal standard of care.Â  Further, when asked whether it would be proper to\r\n  unilaterally terminate a patient with a serious heart problem days before\r\n  scheduled surgery, Dr. Beard testified:\r\n\r\n  [A]gain,\r\n    it depends on the situation.Â  If you've got a really bad relationship--trust is\r\n    so important.Â  Nobody wants to go into an operation with a doctor they don't\r\n    trust, and if you have the opportunity to change it . . . that may be a better\r\n    option.Â  It's not a good thing to leave somebody hanging out, but on the other\r\n    hand, trust is [] very important.\r\n\r\n We find Dr. Beard's\r\n  testimony does not establish a general standard for termination and, to the\r\n  extent it does, it does not establish that Dr. Feldman's actions constituted a\r\n  breach of that standard.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Melton failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dr.\r\n  Feldman's termination of the doctor-patient relationship constituted\r\n  malpractice.\r\nD. Common Knowledge Exception\r\nMelton\r\n  argues even if the expert testimony was insufficient to establish the generally\r\n  recognized standard of care, breach, and proximate causation, expert testimony\r\n  was unnecessary because the nature of the malpractice was such that the common\r\n  knowledge exception should apply.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  expert testimony is generally required in medical malpractice cases, it is not\r\n  required if the subject matter lies within the ambit of common knowledge so\r\n  that no special learning is required to evaluate the conduct of the defendants.Â  See Pederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 142, 341 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1986)\r\n  (&quot;Expert testimony is not required, however, in situations where the\r\n  common knowledge or experience of laymen is extensive enough for them to be\r\n  able to recognize or infer negligence on the part of the doctor and also to\r\n  determine the presence of the required causal link between the doctor's actions\r\n  and the patient's medical problems.&quot;).Â  &quot;When expert testimony is not\r\n  required, the plaintiff must offer evidence that rises above mere speculation\r\n  or conjecture.&quot; Â Welch v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 251, 258, 317 S.E.2d\r\n  758, 763 (Ct. App. 1984). The application of the common knowledge exception in\r\n  proving negligence in a case involving medical malpractice depends on the\r\n  particular facts of the case. Â Sharpe v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Health,\r\n  292 S.C. 11, 14, 354 S.E.2d 778, 780 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\n In support of his argument, Melton cites Green v.\r\n  Lilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 249 S.E.2d 910 (1978).Â  In that case, a patient\r\n  sued for malpractice after her physician failed to remove an intrauterine\r\n  device (IUD) during her tubal ligation, despite the fact that the patient had\r\n  asked the physician to remove the IUD.Â  Id. at 189, 249 S.E.2d at 911.Â \r\n  Our supreme court held the trial court erred in granting the defendant\r\n  physician's motion for directed verdict because the plaintiff presented\r\n  sufficient evidence from which the jury could have reasonably inferred the\r\n  physician committed malpractice.Â  Id. at 193, 249 S.E.2d at 913.Â  In\r\n  arriving at this conclusion, the court held, &quot;[i]t is a matter of common\r\n  knowledge that a tubal ligation renders an IUD or any other birth control\r\n  device useless.&quot;Â  Id. at 192, 249 S.E.2d at 913.Â  \r\nMelton\r\n  asserts &quot;it is a matter of common knowledge that a medical device powered\r\n  by a battery with a shorting mechanism that causes the device to lose power\r\n  without warning is defective,&quot; and that &quot;the failure to remove the\r\n  'useless' device in Green is no different than the implementation [of]\r\n  and subsequent failure to remove a defective device for a year.&quot;Â  However,\r\n  we find this comparison unpersuasive.Â  Although Melton insists on describing\r\n  the ICD as &quot;defective,&quot; in that it was subject to a potential rapid\r\n  loss of power, the evidence clearly shows that was not the case with Melton's\r\n  ICD.Â  Melton even conceded that his injuries did not result from the ICD losing\r\n  power.Â  Thus, Melton's injuries, if any, could only have resulted from the\r\n  ICD's tendency to discharge excessively and/or unnecessarily.Â  We do not find\r\n  it would be within the province of a lay jury to determine whether something so\r\n  complex as an ICD was operating properly; to do so would not only require the\r\n  jury to know the electrical ins and outs of the device itself, but also whether\r\n  the discharges were brought on by a malfunction or an irregularity in Melton's\r\n  heartbeat.Â  Accordingly, Green does not support the applicability of the\r\n  common knowledge exception in this case.\r\nMelton\r\n  also cites Thomas v. Dootson, 377 S.C. 293, 659 S.E.2d 253 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  In that case, a patient sued his doctor for malpractice after the\r\n  patient's mouth was burned during oral surgery by an overheating drill.Â  Id. at 295, 659 S.E.2d at 254.Â  The doctor's counsel conceded there was an\r\n  equipment malfunction and that there had &quot;never been any real dispute that\r\n  a defective surgical drill resulted in the burn to [the patient's] lip.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  On appeal, however, the doctor attempted to resurrect the need for expert\r\n  testimony by arguing that because a surgical drill is such a complex machine,\r\n  &quot;the proper operation of a surgical drill is not something within the lay\r\n  knowledge of jurors.&quot;Â  Id. at 296, 659 S.E.2d at 254.Â  This court\r\n  rejected the doctor's argument because the doctor had already conceded that the\r\n  drill was not functioning properly at the time of the injury, thereby removing\r\n  the need for expert testimony regarding the standard of care for operating the\r\n  drill properly.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Respondents made no such concession in this case.Â  Moreover, as stated\r\n  previously, the evidence in this case suggests that the battery in the ICD was\r\n  functioning correctly.Â  Accordingly, Thomas does not support the\r\n  applicability of the common knowledge exception in this case.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Melton argues the common knowledge exception should apply to the analysis of\r\n  the alleged abandonment, improper selection criteria, and the one-year delay in\r\n  informing.Â  However, he supports these arguments by making reference to the\r\n    expert testimony.Â  We find it contradictory for Melton to argue, on the one\r\n  hand, that a jury would not need the assistance of expert testimony in this\r\n  case, but then support that argument by citing to expert testimony.Â  In sum,\r\n  the common knowledge exception does not apply in this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Based\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n FEW,\r\n  C.J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court\r\n  also granted summary judgment on Melton's causes of action against Dr. Feldman for\r\n  breach of warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and express breach of\r\n  warranty and on Melton's wife's claim for loss of consortium.Â  Melton does not\r\n  challenge these rulings in this appeal.Â  \r\n[2] The record is inconsistent\r\n  as to the timing of the visit during which Melton found out about this\r\n  potential defect in his ICD.Â  Melton testified he found out about the defect\r\n  after the June 10, 2005 incident that forced him to visit the hospital.Â \r\n  However, the &quot;Device Alert&quot; form that informs patients about the defect\r\n  was signed by Melton on May 10, 2005.Â  \r\n[3] Melton alleged\r\n  ten causes of action: (1) products liability, negligence (against Medtronic);\r\n  (2) products liability, strict liability (against Medtronic); (3) breach of\r\n  warranty, merchantability (against Medtronic); (4) breach of warranty, fitness\r\n  for a particular purpose (against all defendants); (5) breach of warranty,\r\n  express (against all defendants); (6) medical malpractice and negligence\r\n  (against all defendants); (7) negligent misrepresentation (against all\r\n  defendants); (8) outrage (against Dr. Feldman); (9) abandonment (against Dr.\r\n  Feldman); and (10) loss of consortium (against all defendants).Â  \r\n[4] Although Melton\r\n  argues on appeal that Dr. Feldman's outrageous conduct consisted of implanting\r\n  a defective device, failing to inform Melton of the risks involved with ICDs,\r\n  failing to inform Melton for a year of the potential defect in his ICD, and\r\n  abandonment, Melton's original complaint appears to limit his outrage cause of\r\n  action to the alleged abandonment alone.Â  Moreover, counsel for Melton conceded\r\n  at oral argument that the abandonment was the only basis for the outrage cause\r\n  of action.Â  Consequently, we limit our analysis of the outrage cause of action\r\n  to Dr. Feldman's alleged abandonment of Melton.Â  \r\n[5] Dr. Beard did not\r\n  testify about the installation of the Medtronic ICD or whether he thought it\r\n  was defective.\r\n[6] During Melton's\r\n  deposition, which was taken after he had the ICD replaced with a\r\n  different Medtronic ICD, he was asked what the ICD prevented him from doing.Â \r\n  He responded, &quot;One thing is I thought I might die.Â  [I] still might. . . .\r\n  I try not to put myself under stress physically or mentally.Â  I do not want\r\n  this device to go off again because it is thoroughly unpleasant.&quot;Â  He also\r\n  testified his damages in this case include the &quot;mental concern and\r\n  wondering every day if this thing is going to go off or not prematurely.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4730","title":"Cricket Cove Ventures, LLC v.

Worley\r\n  (collectively, Respondents), seeking relief from the County's refusal to review\r\n  a sketch plan of a proposed development within Worley's electoral district.Â  Cricket\r\n  Cove challenges the circuit court's order dismissing its complaint pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.Â  We affirm the circuit court's dismissal of Cricket\r\n  Cove's injunction and mandamus causes of action on the ground that they are\r\n  unsustainable under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We reverse the dismissal of the civil\r\n  conspiracy cause of action and remand for further proceedings.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn October 18, 2005, Cricket Cove\r\n  brought an action against Horry County and Horry County Council (Council) seeking\r\n  relief for the refusal of Horry County staff to review Cricket Cove's sketch\r\n  plan of its proposed development within Worley's electoral district.Â  The\r\n  complaint alleged that in January 2005, Cricket Cove purchased approximately 27\r\n  acres in the Little River area of Horry County.Â  The property was located in a\r\n  Resort Commercial zoning district, where construction height was unlimited,\r\n  subject to parking and flight path ordinances.Â  On July 7, 2005, Council held a\r\n  special meeting and gave first reading to Ordinance 107-05 for the purpose of\r\n  limiting the height of all new construction within the Little River area to\r\n  sixty feet.Â  The meeting was not properly advertised, and Cricket Cove was not\r\n  informed of Council's intent to give first reading to the ordinance.\r\nCricket Cove also claimed that on\r\n  August 3, 2005, it submitted a sketch site plan to the county's planning\r\n  department for review and comment.Â  Cricket Cove advised planning department\r\n  employees of its intent to construct two condominium buildings that would\r\n  contain over 200 units each.Â  The planning department accepted the sketch plan\r\n  for review.Â  \r\nCricket Cove further alleged that\r\n  on August 4, 2005, Ordinance 107-05 was referred to the Horry County Planning\r\n  Commission (Commission) for review.Â  The Commission voted to recommend\r\n  disapproval of the ordinance.Â  On August 16, 2005, Council deferred a second\r\n  vote on the ordinance and referred it to Council's Infrastructure and\r\n  Regulations Committee.Â  Meanwhile, a planning department employee sent a letter\r\n  to Cricket Cove stating that its sketch plan needed several modifications.Â \r\n  After making the modifications, Cricket Cove scheduled a meeting with the employee\r\n  for review of the plan. Â Several county representatives attended the meeting to\r\n  advise Cricket Cove that the plan could not be reviewed because it contemplated\r\n  new construction that would exceed sixty feet in height.Â  Cricket Cove's agents\r\n  requested a written rejection or a letter stating the reason for the refusal to\r\n  review the sketch plan, but county representatives refused the request.\r\nIn its October 2005 complaint\r\n  against Horry County and Council, Cricket Cove sought a declaratory judgment\r\n  that the County and Council had violated Ordinance 49-05, was acting upon an\r\n  invalid pending ordinance (draft Ordinance 107-05), and was violating Cricket Cove's\r\n  vested right to have its plan reviewed.Â  It also alleged the County and Council\r\n  were taking its property without just compensation, violating its due process\r\n  rights, and denying it equal protection under the law.Â  Cricket Cove also\r\n  sought a writ of mandamus requiring the County and Council to review its\r\n  proposed plan.\r\nOn July 14, 2006, nine months\r\n  after filing the action against the County and Council, Cricket Cove brought the\r\n  present action against Worley, Gilland and &quot;Persons Unknown, being 'JaneDoe'\r\n  [sic] And 'Richard Roe,'&quot; seeking damages for civil conspiracy and\r\n  injunctive relief.Â  Cricket Cove sought to prohibit Respondents from giving\r\n  orders or instructions to county employees in violation of section 4-9-660 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (1986) and also to prohibit Respondents from discussing\r\n  outside a public forum those matters coming before Council at its meetings.Â  Â Â \r\nThe complaint alleged many of the\r\n  same facts asserted in the action against Horry County, including inadequate\r\n  advance notice of Council meetings.Â  It also alleged that Council conducted a\r\n  meeting on October 25, 2005, and &quot;draft Ordinance 107-05 was voted on with\r\n  a series of amendments.&quot; Â Gilland announced that a public hearing on the\r\n  proposed draft Ordinance 107-05, as amended, would be conducted at a Third Reading\r\n  of the proposed ordinance.Â  The county attorney advised that the changes made\r\n  to the draft ordinance &quot;constituted a major change to the text of the\r\n  proposed [o]rdinance and that it should be referred to Horry County Planning\r\n  Commission for consideration.&quot;Â  After an unscheduled recess, Gilland\r\n  admitted that discussion between Council members concerning the proposed\r\n  ordinance had occurred outside the public forum.\r\nCricket Cove further claimed that\r\n  at Council's January 2006 meeting, draft Ordinance 107-05 was under review for\r\n  Third Reading, and when a Council member sought to amend the draft, Worley\r\n  asked for a recess.Â  During the recess, certain Council members discussed the\r\n  proposed ordinance outside the public forum.Â  Upon return to the public forum,\r\n  the proposed amendment was not discussed, but a vote was taken to defer Third\r\n  Reading until the next scheduled Council meeting.Â  At the February 2006 meeting,\r\n  Council adopted an amendment to the proposed ordinance that changed the height\r\n  limitations to affect only Worley's district and to exempt from the height limitations\r\n  all other areas of the county.Â  Council also adopted an amendment that had the\r\n  effect of changing the height limitation for construction in Worley's district\r\n  from 180 feet to 120 feet.Â  During the meeting, an unscheduled recess occurred.\r\n  Â After the recess, Gilland admitted that Council members had discussed\r\n  Ordinance 107-05 outside the public forum.\r\nThe complaint alleged\r\n  Gilland and Worley, in their individual capacities, as well as persons unknown\r\n  engaged in a civil conspiracy to harm Cricket Cove.Â  The complaint also sought\r\n  to enjoin Gilland and Worley from giving orders to County staff in furtherance\r\n  of the conspiracy and from discussing draft ordinances with other Council\r\n  members outside the public forum.Â  Cricket Cove also requested a writ of\r\n  mandamus requiring Gilland to properly advertise Council meetings.Â  On August 24,\r\n  2006, Gilland and Worley filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP.[1]Â  \r\nOn May 31, 2007, Cricket\r\n  Cove amended its complaint in the action against Horry County to add as\r\n  defendants the individual members of Council in their official capacities, to\r\n  seek a declaration that the application of pending ordinance 107-05 was invalid,\r\n  and to seek an injunction preventing Council members from discussing draft\r\n  ordinances outside the public forum. Â Â \r\nIn the present action, on October\r\n  4, 2007, the\r\n  circuit court granted the motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8) and\r\n  stated that it was unnecessary to address the 12(b)(6) motion. Â This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court properly apply Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, to the present action?\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in failing to include in its order a conclusion that the present\r\n  action should be consolidated with the first action?\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in failing to include in its order a conclusion that Cricket Cove\r\n  should be allowed to amend its complaint in the first action to include the\r\n  causes of action alleged in the present action?\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    Should the\r\n  circuit court's decision be affirmed on the additional sustaining ground that\r\n  the complaint could have been dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure\r\n  to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action? &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard of review as the circuit court in scrutinizing the\r\n  application of Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP. Â Capital City Ins. Co. v. BP Staff,\r\n    Inc., 382 S.C. 92, 99, 674 S.E.2d 524, 528&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2009).Â  A\r\n  defendant may seek dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8) when another\r\n  action is pending between the same parties for the same claim.Â  \r\nIn reviewing the\r\n  dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate court applies the same standard of review\r\n  as the trial court.Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245,\r\n  247&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp; In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on\r\n  a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial\r\n  court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Id. Â \r\nIf the facts and\r\n  inferences drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any\r\n  theory, then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is\r\n  improper.Â  Brazell v. Windsor, 384 S.C. 512, 515, 682 S.E.2d 824,\r\n  826&nbsp;(2009).Â  In deciding whether the trial court properly granted the\r\n  motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider whether the complaint,\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for\r\n  relief.Â  Id.Â  &quot;The trial court and this [C]ourt on appeal must\r\n  presume all well pled facts to be true.&quot; Â Morrow Crane Co.\r\n    v. T.R. Tucker Constr. Co., 296 S.C. 427, 429, 373 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1988). Â &quot;[P]leadings in a case should be construed\r\n  liberally so that substantial justice is done between the parties. Â Further, a\r\n  judgment on the pleadings is considered to be a drastic procedure by our\r\n  courts.&quot; Â Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991) (citation omitted).Â  The court\r\n  should not dismiss the complaint merely because there exists doubt that the\r\n  plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  Doe, 373 S.C. at 395, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  at 248.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Dismissal under\r\n  Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP\r\nCricket Cove contends that the circuit\r\n  court erred in concluding dismissal of its action under Rule 12(b)(8) was\r\n  appropriate.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(8),\r\n  dismissal is appropriate when another action is pending between the same\r\n  parties for the same claim.Â  \r\n\r\n  A. Identity\r\n    of Parties\r\n\r\nCricket Cove argues that its\r\n  claims against Respondents in their individual capacities dictate against the\r\n  application of Rule 12(b)(8) to the present action because the claims in the first\r\n  action were against Respondents in their official capacities as Council\r\n  members.Â  We agree.\r\nTo prevail on a motion to\r\n  dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8), the movant must show that the actions in\r\n  question are between the same parties in their same capacities.Â  1 C.J.S. Abatement\r\n    and Revival Â§ 54 (2005).Â  In Corbett v. City of Myrtle Beach, S.C.,\r\n  this Court concluded that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(8) because the plaintiff's claim for negligent\r\n  infliction of emotional distress against a beach service involved the same\r\n  parties and was &quot;based upon the same facts and circumstances&quot; as the plaintiff's\r\n  first two wrongful death actions against the beach service and the City of\r\n  Myrtle Beach.Â  336 S.C. 601, 610, 521 S.E.2d 276, 281&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1999).Â \r\n  However, it is noteworthy that the Court attached significance to the capacity\r\n  in which the plaintiff brought her two actions:\r\n\r\n  Mrs.\r\n    Corbett brought the Kinard claim in her individual capacity. The consolidated\r\n    wrongful death and survivorship actions were brought in Mrs. Corbett's\r\n    individual capacity and in her capacity as the Personal Representative of her\r\n    husband's estate. Hence, the Kinard claim involves the same parties and is\r\n    based upon the same facts and circumstances as the first two civil actions.Â  \r\n\r\nId.\r\nHere, Respondents were sued\r\n  in their individual capacities in the present action.Â  However, they were sued\r\n  in their official capacities in the first action.Â  Therefore, the circuit court\r\n  erred in concluding that the present action and the first action involved the\r\n  same parties.\r\n\r\n  B. Identity\r\n    of Claims\r\n\r\nIn Corbett, this\r\n  Court concluded the plaintiff's claim for negligent infliction of emotional\r\n  distress against a beach service involved the same claim as the plaintiff's\r\n  first two wrongful death actions against the beach service and the City of\r\n  Myrtle Beach because it was &quot;based upon the same facts and circumstances.&quot;Â \r\n  336 S.C. at 610, 521 S.E.2d at 281.Â  Notably, the circuit court in the present\r\n  action relied on the &quot;same facts and circumstances&quot; test when it\r\n  ruled that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(8) was appropriate.Â  \r\nThis Court revisited the &quot;same\r\n  claim&quot; component of Rule 12(b)(8) in Capital City, and interpreted\r\n  the rule narrowly:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    rule has historic ties to a former statute providing a defendant a similar opportunity to demur; our\r\n    supreme court traditionally interpreted that statute narrowly, stating that it\r\n    only applied when there was identity of parties, causes of action and relief. Â We\r\n    find this approach consistent with modern day practice under rules similar to\r\n    our Rule 12(b)(8). Â Accordingly, we interpret the rule narrowly such that the\r\n      claim must be precisely or substantially the same in both proceedings in order\r\n    for the drastic remedy of dismissal to be appropriate under Rule 12(b)(8).\r\n\r\n382\r\n  S.C. at 105-06, 674 S.E.2d at 531-32 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).Â  Â Â \r\nHere, the cause of action\r\n  for civil conspiracy is not covered in the first case, and the writ of mandamus\r\n  cause of action in the present case seeks relief that is different from the\r\n  relief sought in the causes of action in the first case.Â  Under the narrow\r\n  interpretation of Rule 12(b)(8) set forth in Capital City, the circuit\r\n  court's application of the rule was incorrect because the civil conspiracy\r\n  claim against Respondents in their individual capacities was neither &quot;precisely\r\n  the same&quot; nor &quot;substantially the same&quot; as any claim in the first\r\n  proceeding.[2]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nII. Consolidation\r\n  and Amendment of Complaint (Issues 2 and 3)\r\nAt the hearing on Respondents'\r\n  motion to dismiss, Cricket Cove requested that the present action be\r\n  consolidated with the first action and it be allowed to amend its complaint in\r\n  the first action.Â  Because Respondents were represented by different attorneys on\r\n  each action, the circuit court directed Cricket Cove to contact opposing\r\n  counsel in the first action and to set up a hearing or obtain opposing\r\n  counsel's consent to the requested relief.Â  \r\nCricket Cove failed to complete\r\n  the circuit court's instructions.Â  Certainly, the circuit court had no\r\n  authority in the present action to issue an order affecting the parties in the first\r\n  action without the presence of counsel for those parties.Â  Any such ruling\r\n  would have been the result of impermissible ex parte communications.Â  Cf. Burgess v. Stern,\r\n  311 S.C. 326, 330, 428 S.E.2d 880, 883&nbsp;(1993)&nbsp;(stating that the\r\n  judicial practice of merely signing an order prepared by counsel of one party\r\n  denies to the deprived parties an opportunity to be heard in matters that\r\n  affect them).Â \r\n  Therefore, the circuit court properly declined to make such a ruling. \r\nIII. Rule\r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP (Issue 4)\r\nRespondents argue as an\r\n  additional sustaining ground that this Court may affirm the circuit court's\r\n  dismissal of Cricket Cove's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  As discussed\r\n  below, we believe the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause\r\n  of action for civil conspiracy only.Â  We will address each cause of action in\r\n  turn.\r\n\r\n  A. Civil\r\n    Conspiracy\r\n\r\n&quot;A civil conspiracy\r\n  is a combination of two or more persons joining for the purpose of injuring and\r\n  causing special damage to the plaintiff.&quot;Â  McMillan v. Oconee Mem'l\r\n    Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886&nbsp;(2006); see\r\n      also Todd\r\n        v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 284, 292, 278 S.E.2d 607, 611\r\n  (1981) (&quot;Conspiracy is the conspiring or combining together to do\r\n  an unlawful act to the detriment of another or the doing of a lawful act in an\r\n  unlawful way to the detriment of another.&quot;); Vaught v. Waites, 300 S.C. 201,\r\n  208, 387 S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1989) (&quot;Civil\r\n  conspiracy consists of three elements: (1) a combination of two or more\r\n  persons, (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes him\r\n  special damage.&quot;). Â The gravamen of the tort\r\n  of civil conspiracy is the damage resulting to the plaintiff from an overt act\r\n  done pursuant to a common design. Â Vaught, 300 S.C. at 208, 387 S.E.2d\r\n  at 95.\r\nIn a civil conspiracy claim,\r\n  one must plead acts in furtherance of the conspiracy that are separate and\r\n  independent from other wrongful acts\r\n  alleged in the complaint, and the failure to properly plead such acts will merit\r\n  the dismissal of the claim.Â  See Todd, 276\r\n  S.C. at 293, 278 S.E.2d at 611 (dismissing\r\n  plaintiff's civil conspiracy cause of action because it did no more than\r\n  incorporate the complaint's allegations in the previous causes of action and\r\n  because the only alleged wrongful acts pled were those for which damages had\r\n  already been sought). Â Further, the damages alleged must go beyond the damages alleged\r\n  in other causes of action. Â See Vaught, 300 S.C. at 209,\r\n  387 S.E.2d at 95 (holding that Todd barred a conspiracy cause of action\r\n  because no special damages were alleged aside from the damages already\r\n  alleged for the plaintiff's breach of contract cause of action in that case).\r\nHere, the complaint\r\n  alleges that Respondents conspired with county staff and with each other\r\n  outside the public forum to obstruct Cricket Cove's development plans.Â  The\r\n  complaint also alleges the rejection by county staff of Cricket Cove's sketch\r\n  site plan in furtherance of the conspiracy.Â  Further, Cricket Cove seeks the\r\n  special damages of the costs incurred on the acquisition of the real property\r\n  in question and its development costs.Â  The remaining three causes of action in\r\n  the complaint seek injunctive relief rather than damages.Â  Therefore, as\r\n  contained within the present action, the conspiracy claim meets the\r\n  requirements set forth in Todd and Vaught.Â  \r\nRespondents argue\r\n  that the facts ostensibly supporting the conspiracy claim are alleged within an\r\n  official capacity setting and therefore the alleged acts arise in the context\r\n  of a principal-agent relationship, preventing the combination of two or more\r\n  persons necessary to prove a conspiracy.Â  We disagree.Â  In McMillan, our\r\n  Supreme Court limited this &quot;intracorporate conspiracy&quot; doctrine to persons\r\n  acting within the scope of their employment.Â  367 S.C. at 564-65, 626 S.E.2d at\r\n  887.Â  Other jurisdictions have similarly limited the doctrine.Â  See ePlus Tech.,\r\n    Inc. v. Aboud, 313 F.3d 166,\r\n  179 (4th Cir. 2002)&nbsp;(&quot;[T]he intracorporate\r\n  immunity doctrine does not apply where a corporate 'officer has an independent\r\n  personal stake in achieving the corporation's illegal objectives.'&quot;\r\n  (quoting Greenville Pub. Co. v. Daily Reflector, Inc., 496 F.2d 391, 399\r\n  (4th Cir. 1974))); McAndrew v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 206 F.3d\r\n  1031, 1036 (11th Cir. 2000) (&quot;Simply put, under\r\n  the doctrine, a corporation cannot conspire with its employees, and its\r\n  employees, when acting in the scope of their employment, cannot conspire\r\n  among themselves.&quot;) (emphasis added); Garza v. City of Omaha,\r\n  814 F.2d 553, 556 (8th Cir. 1987) (&quot;While it is\r\n  true that a corporation cannot conspire with itself, an intracorporate\r\n  conspiracy may be established where individual defendants are also named and\r\n  those defendants act outside the scope of their employment for personal reasons.&quot;). \r\nHere, Cricket Cove\r\n  asserts the civil conspiracy claim against Respondents in their individual\r\n  capacities rather than their official capacities as Council members.Â  It may be\r\n  reasonably inferred from the complaint as a whole that Cricket Cove is alleging\r\n  Respondents had a personal stake in preventing Cricket Cove from moving forward\r\n  with its development plans.Â  Therefore, the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine\r\n  does not apply to Cricket Cove's conspiracy claim against Respondents in their\r\n  individual capacities.\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we believe Cricket Cove's complaint states facts sufficient to\r\n  constitute a cause of action for civil conspiracy.\r\n\r\n  B. Section\r\n    4-9-660 of the South Carolina Code (1986)\r\n\r\nCricket\r\n  Cove's second cause of action includes a request for a declaration that\r\n  Respondents' actions in giving orders or instructions to county employees and\r\n  members of county commissions violate section 4-9-850 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (1986).Â  Respondents assert that section 4-9-850 applies to the county\r\n  manager form of government and that Horry County has adopted the administrator\r\n  form of government.Â  Respondents argue that the comparable provision for the administrator\r\n  form of government, section 4-9-660 of the South Carolina Code (1986), does not\r\n  create a private right of action.[3]\r\nSection\r\n  4-9-660 states:\r\n\r\n  Except\r\n    for the purposes of inquiries and investigations, the council shall deal with\r\n    county officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision\r\n    of the county administrator solely through the administrator, and neither the\r\n    council nor its members shall give orders or instructions to any such officers\r\n    or employees.\r\n\r\nRespondents\r\n  are correct that section 4-9-660 does not create a private right of action.Â  No\r\n  provision in Chapter 9 of Title 4 of the Code creates any private right of\r\n  action.Â  Further, an injunction should be granted only when some irreparable\r\n  injury is threatened for which the parties have no adequate remedy at law.Â  Sanford\r\n    v. S.C. State Ethics Comm'n, 385 S.C. 483, 496, 685 S.E.2d 600, 607&nbsp;(2009).Â  Cricket Cove has\r\n  failed to allege in its complaint that it will be irreparably harmed if an\r\n  injunction is not granted or that it has no adequate remedy at law.Â  On the\r\n  contrary, in its conspiracy cause of action, which is based on the same conduct\r\n  of Respondents, Cricket Cove seeks a remedy of lawâ€”an amount &quot;not less\r\n  than the costs incurred to date by [Cricket Cove] on the acquisition of the\r\n  Real Property and development costs associated directly therewith . . . .&quot;\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, Cricket Cove has not stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause\r\n  of action for an injunction against violation of section 4-9-660.\r\nC. Freedom of Information\r\n  Act\r\nIn its third cause of action,\r\n  Cricket Cove is seeking to enforce section 30-4-70(c) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2007).Â  Section 30-4-70(c) is part of the Freedom of Information\r\n  Act (FOIA) and prohibits the use of any chance meeting, social\r\n  meeting, or electronic communication in circumvention of the spirit of FOIA\r\n  requirements to act on a matter over which the public body has supervision,\r\n  control, jurisdiction, or advisory power.Â  The FOIA, specifically section 30-4-100\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2007), contains a civil enforcement provision\r\n  granting standing to a South Carolina citizen to seek injunctive relief against\r\n  a violation of any FOIA provision.Â  Section 30-4-100(a) states the following:\r\n\r\n  Any citizen of the State may apply to the circuit court for either\r\n    or both a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to enforce the provisions\r\n    of this chapter in appropriate cases as long as such application is made no\r\n    later than one year following the date on which the alleged violation occurs or\r\n    one year after a public vote in public session, whichever comes later. The\r\n    court may order equitable relief as it considers appropriate, and a\r\n      violation of this chapter must be considered to be an irreparable injury for\r\n      which no adequate remedy at law exists.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nAssuming, without deciding, that Cricket Cove has\r\n  standing as a &quot;citizen of the State,&quot; it is suing Respondents in\r\n  their individual capacities.Â  The FOIA was created to allow citizens to be\r\n  advised of the performance of public officials and of the decisions that are\r\n  reached in public activity and in the formulation of public policy.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (2007).Â  Hence, the facts as stated in Cricket Cove's complaint fail\r\n  to state a FOIA cause of action. \r\nD. Writ of Mandamus\r\nIn its fourth cause of action,\r\n  Cricket Cove seeks a writ of mandamus requiring Gilland to perform her duties\r\n  as Council's chairwoman to properly publish notice of Council meetings.Â  The\r\n  following elements are necessary to obtain a writ of mandamus\r\n  requiring the performance of an act:Â  (1) a duty to perform the act; (2) the\r\n  ministerial nature of the act; (3) the petitioner's specific legal right for\r\n  which discharge of the duty is necessary; and (4) a lack of any other legal\r\n  remedy.Â  See Sanford, 385 S.C. at 494, 685 S.E.2d at 606.\r\nRespondents\r\n  correctly assert that a writ of mandamus, by its very nature, cannot be issued\r\n  against a person in his individual versus official capacity.Â  Because no relief\r\n  can be granted on this particular claim, its dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\r\n  would have been proper.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court incorrectly\r\n  concluded that the parties in the present action are identical to those in the\r\n  first action.Â  Further, the circuit court's &quot;same claim&quot; analysis\r\n  under Rule 12(b)(8), SCRCP, was based on a standard that is no longer\r\n  controlling in South Carolina.Â  However, we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  dismissal of Cricket Cove's injunction and mandamus causes of action on the\r\n  ground that they are unsustainable under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We reverse the dismissal\r\n  of the civil conspiracy cause of action and remand for further proceedings.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nKONDUROS and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 12(b)(6)\r\n  and (8) state in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  Every defense, in law or fact, to a cause of action in any\r\n    pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim,\r\n    shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except\r\n    that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion:\r\n    Â . . . (6) failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action .\r\n    . . (8) another action is pending between the same parties for the same claim.\r\n\r\n[2] We\r\n  note the circuit court did not have the benefit of the Capital City opinion when it dismissed the present case.\r\n[3] Paragraph\r\n  11 of Cricket Cove's complaint references section 4-9-660 (administrator form\r\n  of government) rather than section 4-9-850 (county manager form of\r\n  government).Â  Therefore, the subsequent, inconsistent references to section\r\n  4-9-850 in the complaint's allegations under the second cause of action were\r\n  likely scrivener's errors, and we will base the remainder of our discussion on\r\n  that assumption.Â  See Wilson v. Niesse, 244 N.E.2d\r\n  436&nbsp;(Ind.&nbsp;1969) (&quot;We do not feel that the use of a misspelled\r\n  word, a misplaced comma or a period should deny litigants the\r\n  right to have their controversies settled where it is apparent from the general\r\n  context of the pleading what the meaning is.&quot;). \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4731","title":"HHHunt Corporation v.

Â§ 1983);&quot; &quot;Waiver/Estoppel/Vested\r\n  Right;&quot; &quot;Mandamus;&quot; &quot;Injunction;&quot; and &quot;Declaratory\r\n  Judgment.&quot;Â  In support of these causes of action, Appellants alleged that in\r\n  1985, the Huckabees granted the Town a &quot;Water Line Easement&quot; across\r\n  the Property.Â  By means of this easement, the Town agreed to provide water\r\n  service to the Property.Â  A copy of the easement document states, in pertinent\r\n  part, the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  By\r\n    acceptance and recording of this easement and right of way the Town of\r\n    Lexington agrees to provide the grantors two Â¾ inch water taps free of charge\r\n    at any time in the future to serve their property upon which this easement is\r\n    located, provided that the property is annexed into the Town of Lexington at\r\n      that time.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).[1]Â \r\n  As a result of the easement, the Town's water facilities &quot;cross and\r\n  physically occupy a portion of the property.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\nAppellants also claimed that\r\n  with the Town's full knowledge, the Huckabees constructed a sewer line for\r\n  connection to the Town's sanitary sewer system and paid the Town $1,350 for it to\r\n  inspect the line and to process and review the Huckabees' application for\r\n  approval of the line.Â  As part of the application process, the Huckabees\r\n  obtained a Wastewater Construction permit from the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) to construct a sanitary sewer system to\r\n  connect to the Town's system.Â  Appellants further alleged that the Central\r\n  Midlands Regional Planning Council certified that the Huckabees' proposed sewer\r\n  line conformed to the local water quality management plan required by the\r\n  federal Clean Water Act.Â  Although the Town's Planning Commission recommended\r\n  granting Hunt's request to annex the Property, the Lexington Town\r\n  Council declined to annex the Property or to provide water and sewer services to\r\n  the Property.Â  \r\nAppellants argued that the Town's\r\n  ordinances give no authority to the Town Council to rule on requests for water\r\n  and wastewater services and that the Town Council's reasons for refusing these services\r\n  were unrelated to considerations applicable to water and wastewater services as\r\n  set forth in the Town's ordinances.Â  Appellants also maintained that the Town\r\n  has been providing water and wastewater services to each parcel contiguous to\r\n  and surrounding the Property and that the Town routinely provides water and wastewater\r\n  services to parcels located outside its territorial limits and to customers\r\n  similarly situated to Appellants. Â The Town filed a motion to dismiss the\r\n  complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state facts\r\n  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  The circuit court granted the\r\n  motion, and this\r\n  appeal followed.Â  Â Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in ruling\r\n  that the complaint failed to allege facts showing the Town's duty to provide\r\n  water or wastewater services to the Property?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in summarily ruling that the Town's status as a designated management\r\n  agency pursuant to section 208 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. &sect; 1288, and\r\n  the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 48-1-10 to -350\r\n  (2008 &amp; Supp. 2009), does not create a duty to provide wastewater service\r\n  to the Property?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in concluding that the Town's ordinances do not create a duty to\r\n  provide utility services to non-residents?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in concluding that Appellants failed to plead causes of action based\r\n  on their Fifth Amendment rights?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in concluding that the Town cannot be estopped from denying water and\r\n  wastewater services to the Property?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    6.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in dismissing Appellants' causes of action for mandamus, injunction,\r\n  and declaratory relief? &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the\r\n  dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the appellate court applies the same standard of review\r\n  as the trial court.Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245,\r\n  247&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp; In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint based on\r\n  a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the trial\r\n  court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Id. Â \r\nIn deciding whether\r\n  the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court\r\n  must consider whether the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged in\r\n  the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, state any\r\n  valid claim for relief.Â  Brazell v. Windsor, 384 S.C. 512, 515, 682\r\n  S.E.2d 824, 826&nbsp;(2009).Â  &quot;The trial court and this [C]ourt on appeal\r\n  must presume all well pled facts to be true.&quot; Â Morrow Crane Co.\r\n    v. T.R. Tucker Constr. Co., 296 S.C. 427, 429, 373 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1988). Â &quot;[P]leadings in a case should be construed\r\n  liberally so that substantial justice is done between the parties. Â Further, a\r\n  judgment on the pleadings is considered to be a drastic procedure by our\r\n  courts.&quot; Â Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991) (citation omitted).Â  The\r\n  complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff\r\n  will prevail in the action.Â  Doe, 373 S.C. at 395, 645 S.E.2d at 248.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Failure\r\n  to plead a duty\r\nAppellants contend that the circuit\r\n  court erred in ruling that their complaint failed to allege facts showing the\r\n  Town's duty to provide water or wastewater services to the Property.Â  We agree.\r\nA. Breach of\r\n  Contract claim\r\nHere, Appellants asserted the following\r\n  pertinent facts in their complaint:Â  &quot;In 1985, the Huckabees granted [the\r\n  Town] a 'Water Line Easement' across the Property.Â  By means of this 'Water\r\n  Line Easement', [the Town] agreed to provide water service to serve the\r\n  Property.&quot;Â  Appellants also attached the easement document to their\r\n  complaint.Â  The pertinent provisions state:\r\n\r\n  By\r\n    acceptance and recording of this easement and right of way the Town of\r\n    Lexington agrees to provide the grantors two Â¾ inch water taps free of charge\r\n    at any time in the future to serve their property upon which this easement is\r\n    located, provided that the property is annexed into the Town of Lexington at\r\n      that time.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Thus, the complaint alleges that the Huckabees and the Town entered\r\n  into a contract for the provision of water service.Â  Further, in paragraph 59\r\n  of the complaint, Appellants allege that the Town breached the contract by\r\n  refusing to provide water and wastewater services to the Property.Â  \r\nThe Town contends that the contract\r\n  is subject to the condition precedent that the Property must be annexed into\r\n  the Town's territorial limits.[2]Â \r\n  The Town argues that because the Property has not been annexed, the Huckabees\r\n  have not satisfied the condition precedent and therefore the complaint fails to\r\n  state a contractual duty to provide water and wastewater services.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn evaluating a 12(b)(6)\r\n  motion, the trial court and this Court &quot;must presume all well pled facts\r\n  to be true.&quot;Â  Morrow, 296 S.C. at 429, 373 S.E.2d at 702.Â  Further,\r\n  a court should not dismiss the complaint merely because the court doubts the\r\n  plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  Doe, 373 S.C. at 395, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  at 248.Â  Therefore, we find it improper to examine the merits of a contractual\r\n  defense, such as a condition precedent, in determining the sufficiency of the\r\n  complaint's factual allegations to support a breach of contract cause of\r\n  action.Â  Viewing\r\n  the complaint's allegations, and the inferences from them, in the light most\r\n  favorable to Appellants, we find that they have pled facts sufficiently\r\n  specific to state a claim for breach of contract.\r\nB. Equal Protection\r\n  claim\r\nAppellants' complaint also states facts sufficient\r\n  to support a claim for violation of their equal protection rights. Â Under\r\n  our federal and state constitutions, no person\r\n  shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. Â U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1;\r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  To satisfy equal\r\n  protection, a municipality's classification must meet the following criteria: (1)\r\n  the classification must bear a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose sought\r\n  to be achieved; (2) members of the class must be treated alike under similar\r\n  circumstances; and (3) the classification must rest on some rational basis.Â  Sunset\r\n    Cay, LLC v. City of Folly Beach, 357 S.C. 414, 428, 593 S.E.2d 462, 469&nbsp;(2004).[3]Â  \r\nHere, Appellants\r\n  have alleged &quot;[u]pon information and belief, the [Town] routinely provides\r\n  water and sewer service to customers similarly situated to [Appellants]&quot;\r\n  and &quot;the [Town] routinely agrees to provide water and sewer service\r\n  outside its municipal boundaries in circumstances similar, if not identical, to\r\n  those applicable to [Appellants].&quot;Â  At the 12(b)(6) stage of the\r\n  proceedings, the court must accept these factual allegations as true.Â  See Morrow, 296 S.C. at\r\n  429, 373 S.E.2d at 702 (&quot;The trial court and\r\n  this [C]ourt on appeal must presume all well pled facts to be true.&quot;). Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  Town argues that the Sunset Cay opinion precludes Appellants' equal protection\r\n  argument because our Supreme Court rejected the equal protection argument in\r\n  that case.Â  However, in that opinion, the Court noted that any disparate\r\n  treatment within the class was relatively insignificant:Â  \r\n\r\n  City\r\n    has created two classesâ€”one consisting of residents inside the C-1 and C-2\r\n    districts and one consisting of residents outside those districts.Â  City generally has treated residents within each of those classes alike under similar\r\n    circumstances, although City admits it previously has extended sewer service\r\n      to at least one property in a C-3 district. \r\n\r\n357 S.C. at 429,\r\n  593 S.E.2d at 469 (emphases added).\r\n Here,\r\n  according to the allegations of Appellants' well pled complaint, the Town,\r\n  unlike the municipality in Sunset Cay, routinely provides water\r\n  and wastewater services outside its municipal boundaries in\r\n  circumstances similar, if not identical, to those applicable to Appellants.Â \r\n  Viewing these allegations, and the inferences from them, in the light most\r\n  favorable to Appellants, they have pled facts sufficiently specific to state a\r\n  claim for violation of their equal protection rights.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court erred in ruling that Appellants' complaint\r\n  failed to allege facts showing a duty on the part of the Town to provide water\r\n  or wastewater services to the Property.\r\nII.&nbsp; Clean\r\n  Water Act\r\nAppellants claim that the circuit\r\n  court erred in summarily concluding that the Town's status as a designated\r\n  management agency (DMA) pursuant to section 208 of the Clean Water Act,\r\n  33 U.S.C. Â§ 1288 (section 208), and the South Carolina Pollution Control Act,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-1-10 to -350 (2008 &amp; Supp. 2009), does not create a\r\n  duty to provide wastewater service to the Property.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn their\r\n  complaint, Appellants state that they are &quot;informed and believe that the [Town's] status as the Section 208 DMA requires the [Town] to\r\n  provide water and wastewater services to all landowners in its service area,\r\n  provided that the service is available.&quot;Â  (emphases added).Â  Appellants\r\n  argue that the circuit court was obligated to accept this allegation as true.Â \r\n  However, on a 12(b)(6) motion, the court is required to presume all well pled facts,\r\n  not propositions of law, to be true.Â  See Morrow, 296 S.C. at\r\n  429, 373 S.E.2d at 702 (&quot;The trial court and\r\n  this [C]ourt on appeal must presume all well pled facts to be true.&quot;).Â \r\n  Appellants cannot transform an unsupported proposition of law into a statement\r\n  of fact merely by stating that they are informed and believe it to be so. Â Appellants do\r\n  not cite in their brief any case law recognizing a DMA's duty to provide wastewater\r\n  services under\r\n  either section 208 or the South Carolina Pollution Control Act. Â Further, they\r\n  fail to explain in their brief why they believe the Town's DMA status is\r\n  accompanied by such a duty.Â  Therefore, Appellants have not presented to this\r\n  Court any valid theory of relief to which they are entitled.Â  See Brazell,\r\n  384 S.C. at 515, 682 S.E.2d at 826 (holding that in\r\n  deciding whether a 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper, the appellate court must\r\n  consider whether the facts and inferences alleged in the complaint state any\r\n    valid claim for relief and that if the facts and inferences would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then dismissal for\r\n  failure to state a claim is improper).Â  Because Appellants' argument concerning\r\n  the Town's duty as a DMA is conclusory, we deem it abandoned.Â  See R\r\n    &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437,\r\n  540 S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that an issue is\r\n  abandoned if the appellant's brief treats it in a conclusory\r\n  manner); see also State v. Colf,&nbsp;332 S.C. 313, 322, 504\r\n  S.E.2d 360, 364&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998) (finding a conclusory, two-paragraph\r\n  argument that cited no authority other than an evidentiary rule was abandoned).Â  Â \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we must affirm the circuit court's conclusion that the Town's DMA status does not create\r\n  a duty to provide wastewater service to the Property.Â  Â Â \r\nIII. Ordinances\r\nAppellants assert the circuit\r\n  court erred in ruling that the Town's ordinances do not create a duty to\r\n  provide utility services to non-residents.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â  \r\nIn their complaint, Appellants\r\n  alleged that in refusing their request for service, the Town Council failed to\r\n  apply any of the specific mandatory criteria from the Town's water and sewer\r\n  ordinances and that the Town Council had no authority to rule on service requests.Â \r\n  Appellants further alleged that none of the reasons articulated by Town Council\r\n  in its March 5, 2007 meeting qualified as permissible criteria for a service request.Â \r\n  The circuit court addressed this particular cause of action by stating that there\r\n  are no provisions in the Town's water and sewer service ordinances that prevent\r\n  the Town Council from addressing, granting, or denying water or sewer services\r\n  to any prospective customer.Â  The circuit court further stated that the Town\r\n  Council was well within its authority to address and deny water and sewer\r\n  services.Â  The circuit court then stated &quot;[a]ccordingly, any allegation\r\n  that the Town of Lexington in any way violated its own Town Ordinances is\r\n  without merit and must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which\r\n  relief could be granted.&quot;Â  \r\nAppellants do\r\n  not cite in their brief any specific provision in the Town's ordinances that\r\n  Town Council has violated or that creates even an implied duty to provide water\r\n  service to non-residents.Â  Therefore, Appellants have not presented to this\r\n  Court any valid theory of relief to which they are entitled.Â  See Brazell,\r\n  384 S.C. at 515, 682 S.E.2d at 826 (holding that in\r\n  deciding whether a 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper, the appellate court must\r\n  consider whether the facts and inferences alleged in the complaint state any\r\n  valid claim for relief).Â  Further, Appellants do not cite any law supporting\r\n  their proposition that the Town has no authority to rule on service requests.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Appellants have abandoned these arguments, and we must affirm the circuit\r\n  court's ruling\r\n  that the Town's ordinances do not create a duty to provide utility services to\r\n  non-residents.Â  See Duckett by Duckett v. Payne, 279 S.C. 94, 96, 302 S.E.2d 342, 343&nbsp;(1983)\r\n  (&quot;[T]he appellant carries the burden of convincing this Court\r\n  that the trial court erred.&quot;); R &amp; G, 343 S.C. at 437,\r\n  540 S.E.2d at 120 (&quot;An issue is deemed abandoned if the argument in the\r\n  brief is only conclusory.&quot;).\r\nIV. Substantive\r\n  Due Process\r\nAppellants contend that the circuit\r\n  court erred in concluding that they failed to plead a cause of action based on substantive\r\n  due process.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants do not explain how the\r\n  facts pled in their complaint state a claim for violation of their substantive\r\n  due process rights or cite any authority to support this contention.Â \r\n  Therefore, Appellants have not presented to this Court any valid theory of relief\r\n  to which they are entitled, and they have abandoned their substantive due\r\n  process argument.Â  See R &amp; G,\r\n  343 S.C. at 437, 540 S.E.2d at 120 (&quot;An issue is deemed abandoned if the\r\n  argument in the brief is only conclusory.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we must affirm\r\n  the circuit court's ruling\r\n  on this issue.\r\nV. Estoppel\r\nAppellants maintain that the\r\n  circuit court erred in concluding that the Town cannot be estopped from denying\r\n  water and wastewater services to the Property.Â  We agree.Â  Appellants also\r\n  maintain the circuit court improperly stated that the Town has not acted in any\r\n  manner that would induce Appellants to believe that they would be granted water\r\n  or wastewater services before the Property was annexed into the Town.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\nGenerally, estoppel\r\n  will not lie against a governmental body for the unauthorized acts of its\r\n  officers and agents.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266\r\n  S.C. 81, 87, 221 S.E.2d 773, 776&nbsp;(1976). However, where the officers or\r\n  agents of a governmental body act within the proper scope of their authority, a\r\n  municipality cannot escape liability on a contract within its power to make, on\r\n  the ground that the officer executing it on its behalf was not technically\r\n  authorized to do so, where he was the proper person to enter into such a\r\n  contract.Â  Id.Â  In Townes, our Supreme Court held that the City\r\n  of Greenville was estopped to deny a contract when the officer executing the\r\n  contract was a proper person to enter into such a contract.Â  Id. at\r\n  87-88, 221 S.E.2d at 776. \r\nIf estoppel is\r\n  applicable against a government agency, a relying party must prove: (1) lack of\r\n  knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in\r\n  question; (2) justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct; and (3) a\r\n  prejudicial change in position. Grant v. City of Folly Beach, 346 S.C. 74,\r\n  80, 551 S.E.2d 229, 232 (2001).\r\nHere, Appellants have alleged in\r\n  their complaint that the Town entered into a contract with the Huckabees to\r\n  provide water service to the Property and that the Town's employees took additional\r\n  specific actions on which Appellants relied by making substantial investments\r\n  in water and wastewater facilities located on the Property.Â  Appellants further\r\n  alleged that they made these investments with the Town's full knowledge and\r\n  acceptance of fees in connection with the construction of water and wastewater\r\n  facilities.Â  Appellants have also alleged that after they made these\r\n  substantial investments, obtained governmental approvals, and paid fees to the\r\n  Town, the Town's legislative body improperly voted to deny annexation and\r\n  utility services for the Property.Â  \r\nWe believe Appellants have pled\r\n  facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for equitable estoppel.Â \r\n  Therefore, the circuit court erred in dismissing the cause of action by concluding\r\n  that the Town cannot be estopped from denying utility services to the\r\n  Property.Â  Further, the circuit court's statement that the Town has not acted\r\n  in any manner that would induce Appellants to believe that they would be\r\n  granted utility services before the Property was annexed is misleading because\r\n  it presupposes that the parties' contract made annexation a condition precedent\r\n  to any duty of performance.Â  Such a conclusion is inappropriate within the\r\n  context of a 12(b)(6) motion.Â  See Doe,\r\n  373 S.C. at 395, 645 S.E.2d at 248 (holding that, in\r\n  evaluating a 12(b)(6) motion, a court should not dismiss the complaint\r\n  &quot;merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the\r\n  action&quot;).Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court erred in making this statement.\r\nVI. Mandamus,\r\n  Injunction, and Declaratory relief\r\nFinally,\r\n  Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in dismissing their causes of\r\n  action for mandamus, injunction, and declaratory relief.Â  We agree.\r\nAs to Appellants' cause of action\r\n  for declaratory relief, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  15-53-10 to -140 (2005), provides in pertinent part as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  Any\r\n    person interested under a deed, will, written contract or other writings\r\n      constituting a contract or whose rights, status or other legal relations\r\n    are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract or franchise may have\r\n    determined any question of construction or validity arising under the\r\n    instrument, statute, ordinance, contract or franchise and obtain a declaration\r\n    of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-53-30 (2005) (emphasis added).Â  Because Appellants have pled that they have\r\n  a contract with the Town, they are entitled to seek declaratory relief under\r\n  section 15-53-30 to determine the Town's contractual duty to provide water and\r\n  wastewater services to Appellants.Â  \r\nLikewise,\r\n  Appellants are entitled to seek injunctive relief. Â An\r\n  injunction may be granted where some irreparable injury is threatened for which\r\n  the parties have no adequate remedy at law.Â  Sanford\r\n    v. S.C. State Ethics Comm'n, 385 S.C. 483, 496, 685\r\n  S.E.2d 600, 607&nbsp;(2009).Â  Here, Appellants have alleged in their complaint\r\n  that they will be irreparably harmed if they are unable to obtain water and\r\n  wastewater services from the Town because they have no other alternative for\r\n  these services.Â  They also state that they have no adequate remedy at law because\r\n  the Town's ordinances provide no method by which an aggrieved party can seek\r\n  review of a decision to deny a water or wastewater permit.Â  Moreover, because\r\n  denial of the requested services would severely restrict Appellants' use of\r\n  their property, it is unlikely that money damages would provide an adequate\r\n  remedy.Â  See K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza,\r\n    Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915&nbsp;(1st Cir.&nbsp;1989), cited in CVM Holdings, LLC v. Gamma Enters., Inc.,\r\n  No. 5:10-CV-103-BO, 2010 WL 2541093, at *2&nbsp;(E.D.N.C.&nbsp;June 22, 2010)&nbsp; (&quot;Real\r\n  estate has long been thought unique, and thus, injuries to real estate\r\n  interests frequently come within the ken of the chancellor.&quot;).Â  \r\nAs to a writ of mandamus requiring\r\n  the performance of an act,\r\n  Appellants must assert facts supporting the following elements:Â  1) a\r\n  duty to perform the act; (2) the ministerial nature of the act; (3) the\r\n  petitioner's specific legal right for which discharge of the duty is necessary;\r\n  and (4) a lack of any other legal remedy.Â  See Sanford, 385 S.C. at 494, 685 S.E.2d at 606&nbsp;(setting forth the\r\n  elements necessary to obtain a writ of mandamus).Â  Appellants have asserted\r\n  facts, which if taken as true, establish a clear duty of performance under the\r\n  Town's contract with the Huckabees.Â  Because the duty alleged is not discretionary,\r\n  and because Appellants have alleged that they have no other remedy to obtain\r\n  the utility services, they have asserted facts sufficient to state a claim for\r\n  entitlement to a writ of mandamus.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's conclusions that the Town's DMA status does not create a duty\r\n  to provide wastewater services to the Property and that the Town's ordinances\r\n  do not create a duty to provide utility services to non-residents.Â  We also\r\n  affirm the circuit court's conclusion that the complaint failed to state a\r\n  cause of action for violation of substantive due process.Â  We reverse the circuit\r\n  court's conclusion that the complaint failed to allege any facts showing the\r\n  Town's duty to provide water or wastewater services to the Property as well as\r\n  the conclusion that the complaint failed to allege facts supporting causes of\r\n  action for breach of contract, equal protection, estoppel, mandamus,\r\n  injunction, and declaratory relief.Â  We remand this case for further\r\n  proceedings.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\nPIEPER, J.,\r\n  concurring in part and dissenting in part:Â  I concur in the majority's\r\n  decision to reverse the circuit court's dismissal of Appellants' claims for\r\n  breach of contract, equal protection, estoppel, mandamus, injunction, and\r\n  declaratory relief.Â  However, I respectfully dissent as to the finding that\r\n  Appellants abandoned their claims pursuant to the Clean Water Act, municipal\r\n  ordinances, and the Due Process clause. Instead, I would find Appellants\r\n  alleged sufficient facts in their complaint on these claims to withstand a\r\n  motion to dismiss.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the dismissal of Appellants'\r\n  complaint in full and remand for a trial. See Rydde v. Morris,\r\n  381 S.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009) (finding this court must construe\r\n  the complaint in the light most favorable to Appellants to determine if the\r\n  facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle\r\n  Appellants to relief on any theory of the case); Ashley River Props. I, LLC\r\n    v. Ashley River Props. II, LLC, 374 S.C. 271, 278, 648 S.E.2d 295, 298 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (finding the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss will be\r\n  sustained only if the facts alleged in the complaint do not support relief\r\n  under any theory of law).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We presume that\r\n  when Appellants attached a copy of the easement document as an exhibit to the\r\n  complaint, they intended for it to be incorporated into the complaint even\r\n  though they did not specifically indicate that they were incorporating the\r\n  document by reference to it.Â  See Rule 10(c), SCRCP (&quot;A copy of any plat, photograph, diagram, document, or other\r\n  paper which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes if a\r\n  copy is attached to such pleading.&quot;); see also Brazell v. Windsor,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 824, 826, 384 S.C. 512, 512 (2009) (citing Rule 10(c)).\r\n[2] The Municipal\r\n  Association of South Carolina has filed an amicus brief in support of the\r\n  Town's position.Â  \r\n[3] The\r\n  rational basis standard, not strict scrutiny, is applied in an action involving\r\n  water and wastewater services because the classification at issue\r\n  does not affect a fundamental right and does not draw upon inherently suspect\r\n  distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage.Â  See Sunset Cay, 357 S.C. at 428-29,\r\n  593 S.E.2d at 469 (holding that the rational basis standard applied to a\r\n  developer's case challenging limits on the expansion of a city's wastewater\r\n  system).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
