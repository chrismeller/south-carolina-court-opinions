Brown, Sr., brought this action for (1) breach of contract and (2) bad faith \r\n  refusal to pay benefits against his automobile insurance carrier, Allstate Insurance \r\n  Company, after Allstate refused to pay for the fire loss of Brown's 1984 Corvette. \r\n  After a bench trial, the court found Allstate had breached the insurance contract \r\n  and awarded Brown $25,000 in damages. The court ruled Allstate did not act in \r\n  bad faith in refusing to pay benefits. Brown does not appeal from the ruling \r\n  in reference to the bad faith theory. Allstate appeals alleging the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting evidence concerning the non-prosecution of Brown for arson. \r\n  We reverse and remand. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nOn the evening of February 13, 1995, \r\n  Brown drove his 1984 Corvette to Gaffney to run an errand. While en route, the \r\n  car allegedly had mechanical problems and the engine shut down. Brown parked \r\n  the car at the intersection of Crenshaw Road and U.S. Highway 29, a heavily \r\n  traveled roadway between Cowpens and Gaffney, and left it at that location for \r\n  the night. \r\n   \r\nAt approximately 2:00 a.m. on the \r\n  morning of February 14, 1995,(1) the car was \r\n  found burning where Brown claims he parked it. Officer Patton, with the Cherokee \r\n  County Sheriff's Department, attempted to call Brown by telephone at his home, \r\n  but was unable to locate him. Officer Patton reported the incident to the Spartanburg \r\n  County Sheriff's Department. The car was a total loss as a result of the fire \r\n  and was taken to a salvage yard.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrown attempted to collect for the \r\n  fire loss under the automobile insurance policy he maintained on the car with \r\n  Allstate, but Allstate refused payment. Brown brought this action against Allstate \r\n  for breach of contract and the tort of bad faith refusal to pay benefits. He \r\n  sought damages of $30,000 for the value of the Corvette and prejudgment interest \r\n  on this amount. \r\n   \r\nAllstate answered and counterclaimed, \r\n  alleging in pertinent part that Brown had destroyed his car by an act of arson, \r\n  and he committed misrepresentation and \"reverse bad faith\" by asserting a false \r\n  claim. Allstate averred Brown had both the motive and opportunity to set the \r\n  fire or have the fire set, and Brown misrepresented or concealed his involvement. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn an order following the bench trial, \r\n  the court characterized Brown as \"confused\" as to what happened after he left \r\n  the car parked by the side of the road. Specifically, Brown did not know whether \r\n  he returned to his home or his girlfriend's home to spend the evening. Brown \r\n  claimed to have called Debra Cooper, his former sister-in-law, from his home, \r\n  but his home telephone records did not verify that such a call was made. However, \r\n  Cooper testified she did receive such a call, and Brown explained the call could \r\n  have been made from his girlfriend's home or a pay phone, but he could not remember. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAll of the parties admitted the car \r\n  was intentionally burned. A mechanic who examined the car after the fire testified \r\n  that oil in the crankcase had been mixed with water while the engine was running, \r\n  which could have caused great damage to the engine. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs to the car's value, Mr. Hamrick, \r\n  owner of Hamrick's Used Cars and Trucks, stated the 1984 Corvette was worth \r\n  an estimated $30,000. Mr. Hamrick had been in the automobile business for twenty \r\n  years. Less than one month prior to the fire, Hamrick's son had \"detailed\" the \r\n  Corvette. Hamrick knew the car to be in mint condition with many add-ons, such \r\n  as \"ground effects.\" \r\n   \r\nMr. Mathis, a mechanic in Cowpens, \r\n  had maintained the car for the eleven years Brown had owned it. According to \r\n  Mathis, Brown kept the car in near perfect condition. On February 13, 1995, \r\n  Mathis saw the car. At that time, the motor was \"mid miles and was in good condition \r\n  as far as he could tell.\" He acknowledged on cross-examination that he could \r\n  not determine the interior condition of the engine without taking it apart. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAllstate presented evidence that \r\n  the N.A.D.A. bluebook indicated a car of average condition was worth $9,000. \r\n  The trial court noted Allstate did not attempt to have the vehicle appraised \r\n  as a collector's car or specially equipped car in light of its enhanced stereo \r\n  system and \"ground effects.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMelinda Brown, Brown's former wife, \r\n  testified Brown admitted to her that he had been having problems with the engine \r\n  prior to the fire and that he didn't have the money to fix the car. The trial \r\n  court found Melinda Brown's testimony was not credible, noting Melinda Brown \r\n  smiled at inappropriate times during her testimony, did not recall the parties \r\n  had exchanged criminal warrants prior to her contacting the insurance company, \r\n  and seemed to gain \"some strange pleasure from her testimony against\" Brown. \r\n  As a result, the court disregarded her testimony as \"unreliable and biased.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe court found that, although Brown \r\n  had the opportunity to set the fire, Allstate failed to establish Brown had \r\n  the motive to do so. The court noted that, the morning after Brown parked the \r\n  Corvette on the side of the road, he went to his usual repair shop to make arrangements \r\n  to have the car towed, and apparently did not realize it had burned. Further, \r\n  the court ruled the water in the crankcase was consistent with the fact the \r\n  car broke down prior to the fire. Finally, the court held there was no evidence \r\n  Brown was financially stressed other than the testimony of his former wife, \r\n  which the court found unreliable. Moreover, the cost of repairing the vehicle \r\n  was less than the total loss of the vehicle. The court determined the car was \r\n  worth $30,000, less $5,000 for the \"blown engine,\" and awarded Brown $25,000 \r\n  for breach of contract. \r\n   \r\nThe court dismissed Brown's cause \r\n  of action for bad faith refusal to pay benefits because there were several factors \r\n  which justified Allstate's initial refusal to pay benefits: (1) there were traces \r\n  of gasoline in the carpet padding; (2) the stereo and alloy wheels had not been \r\n  stolen; (3) there were inconsistencies in Brown's testimony as to where he went \r\n  after leaving the car on the side of the road and where he made the telephone \r\n  calls from; and (4) Allstate had the statement by Melinda Brown which attempted \r\n  to establish a motive for the burning. The court declined to award prejudgment \r\n  interest as there was no sum certain involved. Allstate appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the trial court err in allowing \r\n  evidence that Brown was not criminally prosecuted for arson or any other crimes \r\n  related to arson? \r\n   \r\nII. Was the admission of evidence \r\n  of lack of criminal prosecution of Brown prejudicial to Allstate? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nOn appeal of an action at law, tried \r\n  by a judge without a jury, this Court's review extends to the correction of \r\n  errors of law, but we may not disturb the trial court's findings of fact if \r\n  there is any evidence which reasonably supports those findings. Townes Assocs., \r\n  Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). The trial \r\n  court's findings are equivalent to a jury's findings in a law action. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. ADMISSIBILITY \r\n  OF EVIDENCE OF NON-PROSECUTION FOR ARSON \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAllstate contends the trial court \r\n  erred in allowing Brown to present evidence of his non-prosecution for arson, \r\n  as such evidence is inadmissible in a civil proceeding to recover insurance \r\n  proceeds for fire loss. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring trial, the following colloquy \r\n  occurred during the direct examination of Brown by his attorney: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. Of course, you talked to the police \r\n  also.\r\nA. Correct.\r\nQ. And was there any case ever made \r\n  against you for either--for conspiring to burn- \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMr. Patton [Attorney for Allstate]: \r\n  Objection, Your Honor. That's not relevant under the law of this jurisdiction, \r\n  different standard, different burden of proof.\r\nThe Court: I'll hear from you, Mr. \r\n  Holland.\r\nMr. Holland: Well, your Honor, I \r\n  think it is relevant. You know, the issue is that they're maintaining it's arson \r\n  and they're maintaining that my client either did it or had knowledge of it \r\n  and-\r\nThe Court: Your question is: Has \r\n  he ever been charged?\r\nMr. Holland: Yes, sir. Was he ever \r\n  charged with anything in connection with this . . .\r\nThe Court: I'll allow that question. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy Mr. Holland:\r\nQ. Were you ever charged with anything \r\n  in relationship to the loss of this vehicle and that would be either aiding \r\n  or abetting?\r\nA. No, sir.\r\nQ. Conspiracy?\r\nA. No, sir.\r\nQ. Arson?\r\nA. No, sir.\r\nQ. Okay. Any criminal charges at \r\n  all ever?\r\nA. No. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMr. Patton: Your Honor, I continue \r\n  my objection. The case law is clear that you cannot raise evidence of whether \r\n  he was prosecuted or not, charged or not, not the conviction--\r\nThe Court: Your objection has been \r\n  noted.\r\nMr. Patton: If I can quote the case. \r\n  It's Hartford versus Galbreath [sic]. It's a Fourth Circuit decision.\r\nThe Court: Your objection has been \r\n  noted. \r\n   \r\nTo defeat recovery on a fire insurance \r\n  policy, the insurer must show by a preponderance of the evidence, and not by \r\n  clear and convincing evidence, that the fire was of an incendiary origin and \r\n  the insured caused the fire. See Rutledge v. St. Paul Fire and \r\n  Marine Ins. Co., 286 S.C. 360, 334 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 1985). In Carter \r\n  v. American Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 218, 375 S.E.2d 356 (Ct. App. \r\n  1988), this Court set forth the elements of civil arson: \"'An insurance company \r\n  can prevail in an arson defense based solely on circumstantial evidence if it \r\n  shows that the fire was of incendiary origin and that the plaintiff had both \r\n  the opportunity and motive to have the fire set.'\" Id. at 220, 375 \r\n  S.E.2d at 358 (quoting Fortson v. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. 308 S.E.2d \r\n  382, 385 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo rebut the circumstantial evidence \r\n  of arson, Brown sought to introduce evidence that he was not prosecuted for \r\n  the crime of arson. Allstate contends such evidence is inadmissible in a civil \r\n  action to recover for a fire loss under an insurance policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Rabon v. Great Southwest Fire \r\n  Ins. Co., 818 F.2d 306 (4th Cir. 1987), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  addressed the precise question we are faced with in the instant case. In Rabon, \r\n  an appeal from the South Carolina district court, the Fourth Circuit adopted \r\n  \"the rule that a federal trial court commits reversible error when it permits \r\n  the plaintiff in a suit for fire insurance proceeds to present evidence of his \r\n  nonprosecution or acquittal on related criminal arson charges.\" Id. \r\n  at 309. The court explained: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe reasons for this rule are easy \r\n  to appreciate. First, such evidence goes directly to the principal issue before \r\n  the jury and is highly prejudicial. Second, a prosecutor's decision not to prosecute \r\n  and a jury's decision to acquit in a criminal trial are based on different criteria \r\n  than apply in a civil proceeding. In particular, a prosecutor's decision to \r\n  nolle prosse may take into account many factors irrelevant in a civil \r\n  suit, such as the higher standard of proof required for criminal conviction. \r\n  In any event, a prosecutor's opinion whether the insured started the fire is \r\n  inadmissible since [it is] based on knowledge outside his personal experience. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. In his closing argument, \r\n  Rabon's attorney asserted the state's dismissal of criminal arson charges proved \r\n  the insurer's refusal to pay benefits was \"unreasonable\" and was \"part of a \r\n  vendetta against Rabon.\" Id. at 308. The Fourth Circuit held the trial \r\n  court's instructions to the jury that it was \"to be governed solely by the evidence \r\n  that has been presented in the trial of the case in this court\" and to ignore \r\n  anything that may have happened in another court with respect to the alleged \r\n  crime of arson were inadequate to cure the inherent prejudice involved. Id. \r\n  at 309. \r\n   \r\nAlthough there is no state court \r\n  decision in South Carolina directly addressing this point, the rule recognized \r\n  in Rabon has been universally applied by state and federal courts that \r\n  have considered the issue. In Cook v. Auto Club Ins. Ass'n, 552 N.W.2d \r\n  661 (Mich. Ct. App. 1996), the insureds brought a breach of contract action \r\n  against their automobile insurer for failing to pay a claim after their car \r\n  was burned beyond repair under suspicious circumstances. The insurer appealed \r\n  the trial court's denial of its motion to exclude evidence the insureds were \r\n  not criminally prosecuted for arson. The Michigan Court of Appeals, in announcing \r\n  it would apply the rule in Rabon, observed: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWithout exception, all the courts \r\n  that have considered this issue have concluded that evidence of acquittal or \r\n  lack of prosecution is not admissible in an insured's suit against the insurer. \r\n  The rationale underlying this unanimity of opinion does not vary. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 662 (citations omitted). \r\n  See also Kelly's Auto Parts, No. 1, Inc. v. Boughton, 809 F.2d 1247 \r\n  (6th Cir. 1987)(declaring that, as a general rule, evidence that \r\n  criminal charges were not brought is inadmissible in a civil case arising out \r\n  of the same events as the criminal charges; evidence of non-prosecution for \r\n  arson is inadmissible, whether during a party's case-in-chief, during cross-examination, \r\n  or during rebuttal). \r\n   \r\nIn American Home Assurance Co. \r\n  v. Sunshine Supermarket, Inc., 753 F.2d 321 (3rd Cir. 1985), the insurer \r\n  filed a declaratory judgment action, tried to a jury, seeking a declaration \r\n  that it was not liable under a fire policy with the insured. American Home alleged \r\n  the insured \"deliberately caused the fire to be set,\" thereby relieving it of \r\n  its contractual obligations. Id. at 323. The jury rendered a verdict \r\n  for the insured, from which American Home appealed. The Third Circuit Court \r\n  of Appeals held the admission of evidence the insured was not prosecuted for \r\n  arson was reversible error and \"was highly prejudicial because it went to the \r\n  principal issue\" in the case. Id. at 325. The court opined: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe evidence of non-prosecution is \r\n  of very limited probative value in showing that there was no arson because of \r\n  the higher burden of persuasion in a criminal case. Further, prosecutorial discretion \r\n  may take into account many other factors not relevant in a civil suit. At best, \r\n  the evidence of non-prosecution is evidence of an opinion by the prosecutor. \r\n  The opinion of a layperson, as the prosecutor was in this case, however, is \r\n  inadmissible if it [is] based on knowledge outside the individual's personal \r\n  experience. \r\n   \r\nThe inadmissibility of evidence of \r\n  non-prosecution also comports with the general rule that evidence of an acquittal \r\n  in a criminal arson case is inadmissible in a civil arson case. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAmerican Home, 753 F.2d \r\n  at 325 (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals, in \r\n  Krueger v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 510 N.W.2d 204 (Minn. Ct. \r\n  App. 1993), cited Rabon in upholding a trial judge's refusal to permit \r\n  the insured to elicit testimony that he was not criminally charged with arson. \r\n  The court ruled: \r\n   \r\nOrdinarily, evidence of arrest, nonprosecution, \r\n  or acquittal in a criminal proceeding is not admissible in a civil suit arising \r\n  out of the event that formed the basis of the criminal charges. In the federal \r\n  courts, it is reversible error to permit an insured seeking the proceeds of \r\n  a fire insurance policy to present evidence of nonprosecution or acquittal on \r\n  criminal arson charges. Several reasons support the general rule of law excluding \r\n  this evidence: (1) it goes to the principal issue before the jury and is highly \r\n  prejudicial; (2) the burdens of proof in civil and criminal cases are different; \r\n  and (3) a prosecutor's opinion regarding whether the insured set the fire is \r\n  inadmissible evidence because it is based on knowledge outside the prosecutor's \r\n  personal experience. \r\n   \r\nKrueger, 510 N.W.2d at 210 \r\n  (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\nThe rule of inadmissibility continues \r\n  to be universally applied, as evidenced in the recent case of Kamenov v. \r\n  Northern Assurance Co., 687 N.Y.S.2d 838 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999). In Kamenov, \r\n  the insured sued her homeowners' insurer for coverage for a fire loss caused \r\n  by an arsonist who died in the fire. In its answer, the insurer asserted as \r\n  an affirmative defense that the fire was caused by arson procured by the insured's \r\n  husband. The appellate entity found the trial court erred in permitting the \r\n  husband to testify he had never been prosecuted for arson because \"[e]vidence \r\n  of nonprosecution is inadmissible in a civil action.\" Id. at 839. See \r\n  also AMCO Mut. Ins. Co. v. Lamphere, 541 N.W.2d 910, 913 (Iowa Ct. App. \r\n  1995)(upholding the trial court's order that no reference be made to the fact \r\n  the insured had neither been charged with nor prosecuted for arson, stating \r\n  the \"fact that [the insured] was not prosecuted for arson would not make the \r\n  existence of any fact that is of consequence any more or less probable\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold in South Carolina it is reversible \r\n  error for a trial court to permit the plaintiff in a suit for fire insurance \r\n  proceeds to present evidence of an acquittal or the state's failure to prosecute \r\n  on related criminal arson charges. Here, the trial court admitted evidence of \r\n  the state's failure to prosecute Brown despite several objections from Allstate. \r\n  The admission of this testimony was error. See 19 Couch on Insurance \r\n  2d Evidence Â§ 79:571 (Rev. Ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 1999)(indictment of \r\n  insured for arson, or failure to indict him for such crime, is irrelevant and \r\n  inadmissible in action on fire insurance policy wherein defense is that fire \r\n  causing loss was set by insured). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. PREJUDICIAL \r\n  IMPACT OF ERRONEOUS ADMISSION OF\r\n  EVIDENCE IN A BENCH \r\n  TRIAL\r\nBrown concedes the state's decision \r\n  not to prosecute him for arson \"has no probative value in determining whether \r\n  or not [he] was responsible for the arson of his automobile.\" However, he asserts \r\n  there is a presumption of the regularity of the trial court proceedings, i.e., \r\n  that a trial judge, when sitting as fact finder and judge of the law, \r\n  would not have considered improper evidence but would base his decision upon \r\n  competent evidence only. Brown claims, therefore, such evidence was not prejudicial \r\n  in a bench trial. We now consider this \"presumption of regularity\" and determine \r\n  whether the error in admission of this evidence could be deemed harmless in \r\n  these circumstances.  \r\n\r\nA. Presumption of \r\n  Regularity of Trial Proceedings \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrown relies on Ross v. Jones, \r\n  58 S.C. 1, 35 S.E. 402 (1900) and Green v. Green, 228 S.C. 364, 90 \r\n  S.E.2d 253 (1955) in support of his assertion there is a presumption of the \r\n  regularity of judicial proceedings. In Ross, our Supreme Court discussed \r\n  the issue: \r\n   \r\n[A]s we have hitherto held, in regard \r\n  to the verdict of the jury, that such verdict is a compound made up of findings \r\n  of fact governed by the law as announced to the jury by the presiding judge, \r\n  so it is with a judge who sits on the law side of the court without a jury,--his \r\n  judgment is made up by his findings of fact, as governed by the principles of \r\n  law applicable thereto. When, therefore, [the Circuit judge] rendered his judgment, \r\n  it must be assumed that he was controlled in his findings of fact by legal testimony, \r\n  and that he discarded all incompetent testimony. If so, it was no more necessary \r\n  for him to incorporate his findings of fact in a general judgment than there \r\n  was for a jury to incorporate in their general verdict the facts which entered \r\n  into and made up such verdict. So the third exception is not tenable. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRoss, 58 S.C. at 12, 35 \r\n  S.E. at 405-06. \r\n   \r\nIn Green, the Supreme Court \r\n  reversed the decision of a judge sitting in a bench trial because the judge \r\n  clearly used incompetent evidence in his ruling: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is true that where a trial is \r\n  had before the court without a jury, the admission of incompetent evidence does \r\n  not necessarily require reversal, particularly where there is no reasonable \r\n  probability that such evidence had any effect on the result. Some courts hold \r\n  that there is a presumption that the incompetent evidence was disregarded and \r\n  the issue determined from a consideration of the competent evidence only. But \r\n  we do not think these principles can soundly be applied to the situation before \r\n  us. \r\n   \r\nGreen, 228 S.C. at 369-70, \r\n  90 S.E.2d at 255 (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court, in Pearson v. Breeden, \r\n  79 S.C. 302, 60 S.E. 706 (1908), held where a judge presides at a term of court \r\n  and afterwards files a decree in a cause which was on the docket, the legal \r\n  presumption is that there was a hearing according to law resulting in the decree, \r\n  as every act of a court of competent jurisdiction is presumed to be rightfully \r\n  done. The Court instructed: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe principle is thus set forth in \r\n  Vorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 9 L. Ed. 490: \"There is no principle \r\n  of law better settled than that every act of a court of competent jurisdiction \r\n  shall be presumed to have been rightly done, until the contrary appears. This \r\n  rule applies as well to every judgment or decree rendered in the various stages \r\n  of their proceedings, from the initiation to their completion, as to their adjudication \r\n  that the plaintiff has a right of action. Every matter adjudicated becomes a \r\n  part of their record, which thenceforth proves itself, without referring to \r\n  the evidence on which it has been adjudged.\" In his work on \"Judgments\" . . \r\n  . Black formulates the rule thus: \"The judgment of a domestic court having general \r\n  superior jurisdiction is always to be presumed regular and valid, and founded \r\n  upon jurisdiction properly and duly acquired, until the contrary is definitely \r\n  made to appear in some permissible manner.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 306, 60 S.E. at 707. \r\n  See also Ex Parte Strom, 334 S.C. 605, 609, 514 S.E.2d 599, 601 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999)(\"The court of common pleas being a court of record and of general \r\n  jurisdiction, all presumptions are in favor of the regularity of its proceedings \r\n  and irregularities must be shown.\")(quoting Young v. Brabham, 105 S.C. \r\n  62, 66, 89 S.E. 472, 474 (1916)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur courts have applied the presumption \r\n  of regularity to the acts of other judicial operatives. See, e.g., City \r\n  of Columbia v. Town of Irmo, 316 S.C. 193, 196, 447 S.E.2d 855, 857 (1994)(\"There \r\n  is a presumption in favor of regularity in annexation proceedings.\"); Wannamaker \r\n  v. Traywick, 136 S.C. 21, 31, 134 S.E. 234, 238 (1926) (\"Jurors are presumed \r\n  to do their duty, and there is a presumption that they have regarded their oaths.\"); \r\n  Whitcomb v. Manderville, 90 S.C. 384, 392-93, 73 S.E. 775, 777-78 (1912)(holding \r\n  a receiver ordered by the court to sell goods is presumed to have performed \r\n  his duty as directed: \"'The presumption is that no official person, acting under \r\n  oath of office, will do aught which is against his official duty to do, or will \r\n  omit aught which his official duty requires to be done.'\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFederal courts facing this issue \r\n  have found the existence of a presumption. In Westwood Chemical, Inc. v. \r\n  Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 445 F.2d 911 (6th Cir. 1971), \r\n  the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed an appellant's argument the court \r\n  erroneously admitted certain evidence in a bench trial: \"Respecting the allegations \r\n  of improperly admitted evidence, it must be noted that in a trial to the court \r\n  it is presumed that evidence which is improper will be disregarded by \r\n  the court.\" Id. at 918 (emphasis added). The Eighth Circuit Court of \r\n  Appeals, in Brewers and Maltsters Local Union No. 6 v. National Labor Relations \r\n  Board, 301 F.2d 216 (8th Cir. 1962), explicated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the trial of a nonjury case, it \r\n  is virtually impossible for a trial judge to commit reversible error by receiving \r\n  incompetent evidence, whether objected to or not. An appellate court will not \r\n  reverse a judgment in a nonjury case because of the admission of incompetent \r\n  evidence, unless all of the competent evidence is insufficient to support the \r\n  judgment or unless it affirmatively appears that the incompetent evidence induced \r\n  the court to make an essential finding which would not otherwise have been made. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrewers and Maltsters Local Union \r\n  No. 6, 301 F.2d at 225. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the case sub judice, \r\n  the quiddity of the ruling by the court involved the \"arson of the vehicle by \r\n  Brown.\" We come to the ineluctable conclusion the incompetent evidence induced \r\n  the court to make an essential finding which would not otherwise have been made. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Undue Prejudice \r\n  from Admission of Testimony \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe admission of evidence is a matter \r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court. Gamble v. International \r\n  Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996); Stevens v. \r\n  Allen, Op. No. 3017 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 28, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 22 at 6). The court's ruling will not be reversed on appeal absent an \r\n  abuse of that discretion or the commission of a legal error resulting in prejudice \r\n  to the appellant. Recco Tape and Label Co. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, \r\n  439 S.E.2d 838 (1994); Krepps by Krepps v. Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 479 \r\n  S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 1996). Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its \r\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice \r\n  or confusion of the issues. See Rule 403, SCRE; Pike v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Transp., 332 S.C. 605, 506 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1998). For this \r\n  Court to reverse a case based on the admission of evidence, both error and prejudice \r\n  must be shown. Stevens, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen Allstate objected to evidence \r\n  of the state's failure to prosecute Brown for arson, the trial court asked Brown's \r\n  attorney for what purpose he wished to introduce this testimony. Counsel replied: \r\n  \"Well, your Honor, I think it is relevant. You know, the issue is that they're \r\n  maintaining it's arson and they're maintaining that my client either did it \r\n  or had knowledge of it . . . .\" The court ruled, \"I'll allow that question.\" \r\n  The error was exacerbated by continuing query by Brown's counsel as to the non-prosecution \r\n  of Brown, resulting in the court commenting,\"Your objection has been noted.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased on the record before us, it \r\n  appears the trial court admitted the testimony precisely for consideration of \r\n  the ultimate issue that was before the court, i.e., whether Brown had committed \r\n  the arson of his vehicle. Such admission is error. Although Brown argues the \r\n  trial court did not reference the lack of prosecution in its order, the overwhelming \r\n  inference from the record is that the trial court did in fact consider this \r\n  evidence. The trial court never acknowledged the testimony was inadmissible, \r\n  nor did the judge respond affirmatively to counsel's argument in this regard. \r\n  The record contains no indication the trial court reconsidered its initial ruling \r\n  or stated the testimony would not be considered on the ultimate issue of arson. \r\n  Rather, after hearing the reason Brown sought to introduce the testimony, the \r\n  court twice ruled the testimony admissible. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find the general \"presumption \r\n  of regularity\" urged by Brown disappears in this setting because the evidence \r\n  went to the heart of the matter to be decided by the court--whether the arson \r\n  was committed by Brown. Cf. Cannon v. Haverty Furniture Co., \r\n  179 S.C. 1, 20, 183 S.E. 469, 477 (1935)(\"[T]he court . . . must be presumed \r\n  to have examined into the record to ascertain whether it was proper for order \r\n  [of arrest] to be issued, but, when the record shows on its face that it was \r\n  not regular, the presumption that the process was regular disappears.\"). We \r\n  hold the error was unduly prejudicial. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPolicy considerations are of great \r\n  concernment to the court in articulating and applying the \"presumption of regularity\" \r\n  rule. We reject the application of the rule where the court in a bench trial \r\n  allows a potpourri of improper evidence on the ultimate issue in the case \r\n  followed by an order with no ruling or comment by the court indicating a rejection \r\n  of the incompetent evidence. An affirmance of an order where the judge does \r\n  not mention or refer to the incompetent evidence on the ultimate issue in \r\n  the case impacts upon the integrity of the judicial system. Otherwise, a \r\n  trial judge is permitted to receive incompetent evidence on the ultimate \r\n  issue in the case provided there is no mention of or reference to this evidence \r\n  in the final order. \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold evidence of non-prosecution \r\n  of an insured for arson or related offenses is inadmissible in a civil \r\n  suit for fire insurance proceeds. We recognize there is a \"presumption of regularity \r\n  of trial proceedings\" in a bench trial setting. The general \"presumption of \r\n  regularity\" has no efficacy in this case because the evidence admitted in the \r\n  bench trial related to the ultimate issue in the case, i.e., the commission \r\n  of arson by Brown. Here, the trial court erred in admitting evidence concerning \r\n  the non-prosecution of Brown for arson. The error was highly prejudicial and \r\n  warrants a new trial. Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs. CONNOR, \r\n  J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR, J. (concurring \r\n  in part and dissenting in part): I concur with the majority's conclusion \r\n  that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of whether Brown was criminally \r\n  charged with arson. However, I respectfully disagree that the admission of this \r\n  evidence was prejudicial under the facts of this case.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause this is an action at law \r\n  tried by a judge without a jury, we are bound by the factual findings of the \r\n  trial judge. See Ateyeh v. Volkswagen of Florence, Inc., 288 S.C. \r\n  101, 341 S.E.2d 378 (1986) (a cause of action for breach of an insurance contract \r\n  is an action for damages under the contract); Moore v. Crowley &amp; Assocs., \r\n  Inc., 254 S.C. 170, 174 S.E.2d 340 (1970) (an action for damages for breach \r\n  of contract is an action at law); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976) (In an action at law, tried by a judge without \r\n  a jury, the judge's findings of fact will not be disturbed unless they are without \r\n  evidentiary support. The judge's findings are equivalent to those of a jury \r\n  in an action at law.).  \r\n   \r\n In response to Brown's claims for \r\n  breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay benefits, Allstate raised the \r\n  defense of arson. To prove arson, Allstate had to show by a preponderance of \r\n  the evidence that the fire had an incendiary origin and that Brown caused the \r\n  fire. See Rutledge v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 286 \r\n  S.C. 360, 334 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. App. 1985). To prevail on this defense based solely \r\n  on circumstantial evidence, Allstate additionally had to prove that Brown \"had \r\n  both the opportunity and motive to have the fire set.\" Carter v. American \r\n  Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 218, 220, 375 S.E.2d 356, 358 (Ct. App. 1988) \r\n  (quoting Fortson v. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co., 308 S.E.2d 382, 385 \r\n  (Ga. Ct. App. 1983)). \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge found the fire incendiary \r\n  in nature, and he held Brown had the opportunity to set the fire. However, he \r\n  ruled Allstate failed to prove Brown had a sufficient motive for burning the \r\n  vehicle. He specifically discounted the testimony of Brown's former wife who \r\n  testified concerning Brown's financial condition. Additionally, the judge found \r\n  the cost of repairing or replacing the engine in the vehicle would have been \r\n  less than the total $30,000 loss of the vehicle. Moreover, he believed Brown \r\n  could have repaired the vehicle and sold it. The judge also said Brown \"babied \r\n  this car and would have done nothing to damage or injure it.\" Furthermore, the \r\n  judge noted that Brown apparently did not know the vehicle had been destroyed \r\n  by fire because he went to his normal repair shop the next morning in order \r\n  to have the vehicle towed. Finally, the judge held the testimony that the vehicle's \r\n  engine contained oil mixed with water \"seem[ed] entirely possible.\" He found \r\n  this problem could have occurred at the time of the breakdown, given the testimony \r\n  that a mechanic had looked at the vehicle twenty-four hours earlier and had \r\n  not noticed a problem with the engine. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccepting the trial judge's findings, \r\n  as we are required to do, the only evidence introduced by Allstate of Brown's \r\n  motive was the testimony of Brown's former wife. The trial judge specifically \r\n  found this testimony not credible. He opined that Brown's former wife \"smiled \r\n  at inappropriate times during her testimony [and] did not recall that the parties \r\n  had exchanged criminal warrants prior to her contacting the insurance company.\" \r\n  Furthermore, it seemed to the trial judge \"that she gained some strange pleasure \r\n  from her testimony\" against Brown. Because the trial judge was in the best position \r\n  to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, I would defer to his findings. \r\n  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981) (This Court \r\n  is not required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the \r\n  witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign \r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.); Morehead v. Doe, 324 S.C. 559, \r\n  479 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 1996) (An appellate court will not disturb the trial \r\n  judge's findings of fact that depend on the credibility of witnesses.). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn light of Allstate's failure to \r\n  prove by competent evidence an essential element of its defense, Allstate cannot \r\n  show it was prejudiced by the trial judge's admission of the incompetent evidence. \r\n  Therefore, I would find the admission of the evidence constituted harmless error. \r\n  See Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Comm'n, 254 S.C. 378, \r\n  175 S.E.2d 805 (1970), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, 400 U.S. \r\n  986 (1971), reh'g denied, 401 U.S. 949 (1971) (For this Court to reverse \r\n  a case based on the erroneous admission of evidence, both error and prejudice \r\n  must be shown.); McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, \r\n  479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996) (errors are harmless where they could not have \r\n  reasonably affected the trial).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI dissent primarily because the trial \r\n  judge's admission of the incompetent evidence was harmless. However, I also \r\n  believe the presumption of regularity is applicable in this case. As such, I \r\n  would trust that the trial judge made a proper decision in his consideration \r\n  of the evidence. In a case cited by the majority, our Supreme Court stated: \r\n   \r\n   \r\nWhere a trial is had before the court \r\n  without a jury, the admission of incompetent evidence does not necessarily require \r\n  reversal, particularly where there is no reasonable probability that such evidence \r\n  had any effect on the result. Some courts hold that there is a presumption that \r\n  the incompetent evidence was disregarded and the issue determined from a consideration \r\n  of the competent evidence only.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Green v. Green, 228 S.C. \r\n  364, 369-70, 90 S.E.2d 253, 255 (1955) (citation omitted).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWithout a showing that the trial \r\n  judge either affirmatively relied on the incompetent evidence or could not have \r\n  reached the same result without relying on the incompetent evidence, we erode \r\n  the integrity of our judicial system by questioning the judgment and reversing \r\n  the decisions of our trial courts. See Brewers &amp; Maltsters Local \r\n  Union No. 6 v. National Labor Relations Bd., 301 F.2d 216, 225 (8th \r\n  Cir. 1962) (\"In the trial of a nonjury case, it is virtually impossible for \r\n  a trial judge to commit reversible error by receiving incompetent evidence, \r\n  whether objected to or not. An appellate court will not reverse a judgment in \r\n  a nonjury case because of the admission of incompetent evidence, unless all \r\n  of the competent evidence is insufficient to support the judgment or unless \r\n  it affirmatively appears that the incompetent evidence induced the court to \r\n  make an essential finding which would not otherwise have been made.\") (quoting \r\n  Builders Steel Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 179 F.2d 377, \r\n  379 (8th Cir. 1950)). Applying this analysis to the instant case, \r\n  I find there is no \"reasonable probability\" that the incompetent evidence had \r\n  any effect on the result.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs previously discussed, the admission \r\n  of the evidence was harmless. Furthermore, the trial judge did not reference \r\n  this evidence in his order. Given the fact-specific order issued by the trial \r\n  judge, I believe if he had relied on this evidence, he would have discussed \r\n  it. Because the incompetent evidence did not, as the majority asserts, induce \r\n  the trial judge to make any improper findings, I find a new trial is not warranted. \r\n    \r\nAccordingly, I would affirm the trial \r\n  judge's decision.\r\n1. There \r\n  is a conflict in the record as to the date of this incident. In the \"Findings \r\n  of Fact\" section of the court's order, the judge finds the car was found burned \r\n  on February 14, 1995. However, Brown alleges in his complaint that the fire \r\n  loss of the car occurred on March 14, 1995. Brown and Allstate do not recite \r\n  the date of the incident in their respective briefs and do not challenge the \r\n  judge's finding. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3066","title":"Gregoire v.

Byrd seeking an order enforcing a Maine judgment. The \r\n  trial court held the Maine judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in \r\n  South Carolina. Byrd appeals. We affirm.\r\nOn January 31, 1994, Gregoire, a \r\n  Maine resident, came to South Carolina and purchased a 1966 Ford Mustang from \r\n  Byrd, a South Carolina resident, for $9,500.00. Later, after becoming dissatisfied \r\n  with the car, Gregoire sued Byrd in the District Court, Division of Eastern \r\n  York, State of Maine, alleging causes of action for misrepresentation and breach \r\n  of warranty. Byrd answered the complaint asserting, \"I do not submit to the \r\n  jurisdiction of this court.\" Byrd also denied Gregoire's allegations and asserted \r\n  various substantive defenses.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1995, Gregoire filed \r\n  a summary judgment motion. Accompanying the motion were a document entitled \r\n  \"Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts\" and an affidavit executed by Gregoire \r\n  himself. Both these documents address the material allegations of Gregoire's \r\n  substantive claims as well as the issue of personal jurisdiction.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWithin the motion was a memorandum \r\n  of law entitled \"Section 1 - Jurisdiction,\" in which Gregoire requested \"an \r\n  order granting summary judgment on the issue of personal jurisdiction in this \r\n  case\" and gave a detailed argument supporting this request. In the motion itself, \r\n  however, Gregoire requested \"summary judgment on his claim, on the grounds that \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact set forth in the pleadings \r\n  and Affidavit of Plaintiff annexed hereto, and that Plaintiff is entitled to \r\n  judgment as a matter of law.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs required by Maine court rules, \r\n  the summary judgment motion included language advising Byrd that he had 21 days \r\n  after the filing of the motion to file any matter in opposition to it, that \r\n  Byrd's failure to \"file timely opposition\" would be deemed a waiver of all objections \r\n  to the motion, and that the motion could be granted without further notice or \r\n  hearing in the event of such a failure.(1) On \r\n  February 27, 1995, several days after the time to file a response had expired, \r\n  Byrd filed two documents with the Maine court. In the first document, entitled \r\n  \"Responce [sic] to Motion for Summary Judgment,\" Byrd asserted the Maine court \r\n  did not have personal jurisdiction over him. In the second document, entitled \r\n  \"Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts,\" Byrd gave his version of the substantive \r\n  facts of the case. \r\n   \r\n On May 15, 1995, the Maine court \r\n  ruled and wrote on the face of Gregoire's motion: \"Summary Judgment Granted \r\n  on the issue of liability, only, in favor of Plaintiff. The Clerk shall schedule \r\n  a hearing in damage [sic] and notify the parties.\" (Emphasis added.) The damages \r\n  hearing took place July 17, 1995, and Byrd appeared at the hearing. That same \r\n  day the Maine court also entered a judgment against Byrd for $2,000. An amended \r\n  order followed July 26, 1995, increasing the award to $6,500. Byrd moved, apparently \r\n  unsuccessfully, to vacate the judgment,(2) but \r\n  took no appeal from the decision. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGregoire subsequently filed this \r\n  action in the Lexington County Court of Common Pleas, seeking a South Carolina \r\n  judgment against Byrd based on the Maine judgment. The trial court held Byrd, \r\n  after \"having appeared and filed responsive pleadings and a response to Plaintiff's \r\n  Motion for Summary Judgment, including matters related to the question of jurisdiction,\" \r\n  could not collaterally attack the judgment of the Maine court. Furthermore, \r\n  the trial court found the Maine court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over \r\n  Byrd did not violate Byrd's due process rights. Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  accorded the Maine judgment full faith and credit in South Carolina. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nByrd contends the trial court erred \r\n  in giving full faith and credit to the Maine judgment, claiming: (1) the issue \r\n  of personal jurisdiction was not fully and fairly litigated and (2) the Maine \r\n  court did not have personal jurisdiction over him. We agree with the trial court \r\n  that Byrd cannot assert these arguments in South Carolina. \r\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause \r\n  of the United States Constitution provides that \"Full Faith and Credit shall \r\n  be given in each State to the . . . judicial Proceedings of every other State.\"(3) \r\n  The thrust of the clause is that courts of one state must give such force and \r\n  effect to a foreign judgment as the judgment would receive in the issuing state.(4) \r\n  As a result, \"a foreign judgment which is regular on its face generally may \r\n  not be collaterally attacked.\"(5)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Colonial Pacific Leasing Corp. \r\n  v. Taylor,(6) this court affirmed an order \r\n  giving full faith and credit to an Oregon judgment. In that case, the defendant \r\n  had raised to the Oregon court the issue of personal jurisdiction along with \r\n  other defenses. This court affirmed the finding that the defendant could have \r\n  litigated the issue of personal jurisdiction in the Oregon proceeding by virtue \r\n  of having made a general appearance in that action.(7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nByrd contends the Maine court did \r\n  not make specific factual findings or issue any rulings on personal jurisdiction \r\n  and the trial court therefore erred in holding that issue was fully and fairly \r\n  decided in the underlying action. He attempts to distinguish Colonial Pacific \r\n  by arguing the defendant in that case \"after initially raising the issue of \r\n  lack of personal jurisdiction, never filed any other papers or documents in \r\n  support of its position . . . [whereas] [i]n the present case [Byrd] filed a \r\n  response to the issue of lack of personal jurisdiction.\" As we understand Byrd's \r\n  argument, he contends: (1) unlike the present case, the issue of whether the \r\n  Oregon court in Colonial Pacific Leasing Corp. actually ruled on the \r\n  issue of personal jurisdiction was not on appeal before this court and (2) because \r\n  he continued to challenge the assertion of personal jurisdiction in his response \r\n  to Gregoire's summary judgment motion, the Maine court had to issue an explicit \r\n  ruling on this question before the judgment could be given full faith and credit \r\n  in South Carolina. We disagree. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding \"the general rule \r\n  that a judgment is entitled to full faith and credit - even as to questions \r\n  of jurisdiction - when the second court's inquiry discloses that those questions \r\n  have been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the court which \r\n  rendered the original judgment,\"(8) the absence \r\n  of an explicit ruling on personal jurisdiction in this case does not make the \r\n  Maine judgment unenforceable under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, the presumption of regularity \r\n  of a judgment includes the presumption that the issuing court had jurisdiction \r\n  over the subject matter and the parties.(9)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSecond, contrary to Byrd's contention \r\n  on appeal, the summary judgment motion encompassed more than the issue of personal \r\n  jurisdiction. The documents filed with the motion related specific facts concerning \r\n  Byrd's liability, and Gregoire stated in the motion itself that he was moving \r\n  for \"summary judgment on his claim.\" Byrd's response to the summary judgment \r\n  motion was not timely; therefore, there were no issues of material fact to prevent \r\n  the Maine court from granting summary judgment on the issue of liability.(10) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nFinally, although Byrd himself raised \r\n  the issue of personal jurisdiction and had the opportunity to litigate it in \r\n  the Maine proceeding, he made, at best, only a procedurally deficient motion \r\n  to vacate the judgment on that basis(11) and \r\n  did not pursue the issue on appeal in Maine. Because Byrd agreed to litigate \r\n  the issue of personal jurisdiction in Maine, the judgment is not subject to \r\n  collateral attack on that ground.(12) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause we hold the trial court properly \r\n  determined the Maine judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in South \r\n  Carolina, we decline to address the merits of Byrd's jurisdictional challenge.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J., concurs.

Swent, both of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J.: This \r\n  is an appeal from an order of the trial court appointing a guardian ad litem \r\n  for Barry A. Wilson, Jr. The trial court found Wilson incompetent under Rule \r\n  17(c), SCRCP, and appointed a guardian ad litem to represent him in this action. \r\n  Wilson appeals, attacking both the court's finding of incompetency \r\n  and its jurisdiction to make the finding. We reverse and remand.(1)\r\nOn January 18, 1989, a balcony upon \r\n  which Wilson was standing collapsed, causing him to fall to the ground and suffer \r\n  severe injuries, including some degree of mental impairment.(2) \r\n  Wilson hired attorney Dallas Ball, the respondent, to prosecute a negligence \r\n  claim against the Fortis Corporation and Womack Construction Company. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn May 8, 1995, the trial court called \r\n  Wilson's case for trial. At that time, Ball represented to the court that an \r\n  offer of settlement had been made by the defendants. Ball then requested to \r\n  have a guardian ad litem appointed for Wilson based on mental incompetency. \r\n  Judge Henry McKellar granted Ball's request and appointed Robert Lusk, an attorney, \r\n  as Wilson's guardian ad litem. Based on Lusk's recommendation, Judge James Johnson \r\n  approved a settlement between the parties for $150,000 on July 17, 1995. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWilson subsequently retained attorney \r\n  Francis T. Draine to bring suit against Ball, Lusk, and Fortis' and Womack's \r\n  attorney, Robert Nance. Wilson's complaint alleges a cause of action for conspiracy \r\n  against Ball, Lusk, and Nance, and a cause of action for legal malpractice against \r\n  Ball. His complaint also seeks to have the settlement voided. Ball answered \r\n  the complaint and moved to have a guardian ad litem appointed for Wilson, alleging \r\n  Wilson was incompetent and could not proceed without one. In the alternative, \r\n  Ball moved to have the action dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7), SCRCP. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn February 25, 1998, Judge Joseph \r\n  Watson heard Ball's petition requesting a guardian ad litem for Wilson. By an \r\n  order dated March 27, 1998, Judge Watson granted the motion and appointed Dottie \r\n  C. Ingram guardian ad litem. In his ruling, Judge Watson, expressly referencing \r\n  the Womack action, found there had been \"no change of circumstance\" since the \r\n  dismissal of the Womack action \"to warrant a finding that the Guardian ad Litem \r\n  [was] no longer required for purposes of this litigation.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWilson argues the trial court erred \r\n  in requiring him to prove changed circumstances to establish his competency \r\n  to litigate the instant action without a guardian ad litem. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe terms \"guardian\" and \"guardian \r\n  ad litem\" have separate and distinct legal meanings; thus, persons appointed \r\n  to serve in those capacities are charged with separate and distinct duties and \r\n  obligations. A \"guardian\" is one given the power and charged with the duty of \r\n  taking care of a person who is considered incapable of administering his or \r\n  her own affairs and of managing his or her property and rights.(3) \r\n  A \"guardian ad litem,\" on the other hand, is one authorized to prosecute on \r\n  behalf of or defend an incapacitated person in any suit to which the incapacitated \r\n  person may be a party and to protect his or her interests in the particular \r\n  litigation.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn South Carolina, jurisdiction to \r\n  adjudicate someone incapacitated and to appoint a guardian for the person is \r\n  vested exclusively in the probate court.(5) Although \r\n  the authority for a circuit court to appoint a guardian ad litem is inherent \r\n  in the court itself,(6) Rule 17(c), SCRCP, expressly \r\n  authorizes the circuit court to appoint a guardian ad litem for an incapacitated \r\n  person, such as a minor or incompetent, if the incapacitated person \"does not \r\n  have a duly appointed representative.\"(7) Here, \r\n  Wilson did not have a guardian or other \"duly appointed representative.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor that matter, neither did Wilson \r\n  have a guardian ad litem at the time Ball moved to have one appointed for him \r\n  in this case. Lusk's appointment, which Judge Watson relied on so strongly, \r\n  had ended with the dismissal of the Womack action.(8) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nGenerally, the party alleging incompetency \r\n  bears the burden of proof of the issue.(9) Judge \r\n  Watson, however, put the burden of proof on Wilson, the party denying the allegation \r\n  of incompetency. He did so by referencing the finding of incompetency made by \r\n  Judge McKellar at an earlier time in an ended law suit and by requiring Wilson \r\n  to show the circumstances regarding his competency to protect his interest in \r\n  litigation had changed since the court made those prior findings. This was error. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n Because Wilson has never been adjudicated \r\n  incompetent by the probate court and therefore enjoys the presumption of competency,(10) \r\n  Ball had the burden of proving Wilson was now incompetent so as to require the \r\n  appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent him in this action.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe might add this comment concerning \r\n  guardians ad litem. The very nature of a guardian ad litem dictates a fresh \r\n  evaluation whenever a court is asked to appoint a guardian ad litem for an alleged \r\n  incompetent adult who, as in the present case, resists the appointment. Courts \r\n  should make every effort not to appoint guardians ad litem for persons who are \r\n  competent. This is because no court should deprive \"competent persons of the \r\n  right to control their own litigation.\"(12) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is something fundamental in \r\n  the matter of a litigant being able to use his personal judgment and intelligence \r\n  in connection with a lawsuit affecting him, and in not having a guardian's judgment \r\n  and intelligence substituted relative to the litigation affecting the alleged \r\n  incompetent. Furthermore, there is something fundamental in a party litigant \r\n  being able to employ an attorney of his voluntary choice to represent him in \r\n  court and in being free to reject or accept the advice of such attorney. The \r\n  imposition of a guardian ad litem could very well substitute his judgment, inclinations \r\n  and intelligence for an alleged incompetent's. . . . (13) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWilson's challenge to the trial court's \r\n  jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad litem without a finding of incompetency \r\n  by the probate court first having been made is manifestly without merit.(14) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  The record \r\n  indicates that despite the accident Wilson completed his degree at Clemson University, \r\n  received his real estate broker's license, and received a commercial driver's \r\n  license. \r\n3.

We \r\n  affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis litigation arises from the sale \r\n  and option of a 231-acre tract of land in North Charleston, South Carolina. \r\n  The property was owned by Whitfield Construction Company and Floyd Whitfield,(1) \r\n  the company's general partner.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn early 1987, Lincoln Developers \r\n  and related entities (the Developer) investigated the feasibility of purchasing \r\n  and developing Whitfield's property, along with an adjoining 18-acre plot owned \r\n  by a third party, Kenneth Willard. Whitfield's property consisted of Tracts \r\n  A, C, F, and G, and Willard's property consisted of Tract E. The \r\n  combined properties, totaling 249 acres, are bounded on two sides by Ashley \r\n  Phosphate and Dorchester Roads. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The Developer had a site plan prepared \r\n  for the entire 249 acres. The Developer intended, as the initial phase of development, \r\n  to construct a shopping center on Tracts A and E. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn July 1987, the Developer entered \r\n  into a purchase-option agreement with Whitfield to purchase Tracts A and C, \r\n  with Tract A being expanded to include the roadbed for the proposed Lincoln \r\n  Boulevard. The proposed roadway, which was designed to provide principal access \r\n  to the property, was to extend from Ashley Phosphate Road along the northern \r\n  boundary of Tract A, which adjoins Tract G, through Tract F and terminate at \r\n  Dorchester Road. The agreement further provided the Developer a five-year option \r\n  to purchase Tracts F and G, which together contained 168 acres. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn anticipation of ultimately purchasing \r\n  and developing the optioned property, the Developer planned to install an infrastructure \r\n  of roads, utilities, and drainage throughout the entire 249-acre tract. To this \r\n  end, the purchase-option agreement provided: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBuyer, his agents, employees, or \r\n  contractors shall have the right to enter upon the premises for the purpose \r\n  of clearing trees, foliage, and other debris, to perform excavating work for \r\n  storm water management and to take boring samples, make compaction, percolation, \r\n  or other studies deemed necessary by Buyer. It is further understood that any \r\n  such work shall be performed in such a manner as to ensure that there is no \r\n  diminution in value to any of the Seller's property . . . . Buyer's rights hereunder \r\n  shall include the right to install all utilities in accordance with plans and \r\n  specifications to be prepared by Forsberg Surveying and Engineering and Seller \r\n  will provide all easements required for such purposes. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Developer retained Forsberg Engineering \r\n  and Surveying, Inc., to prepare plans and specifications for the envisioned \r\n  infrastructure. The Developer then purchased Tract E from Willard in August \r\n  1987 and tracts A and C from Whitfield in October 1987. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the time the parties executed \r\n  the purchase-option agreement, rainfall runoff from offsite acres and from Tract \r\n  F drained through a series of ditches and wetlands onto and through Tracts A \r\n  and E and through a culvert under Ashley Phosphate Road, where it emptied into \r\n  the Ashley River. Pursuant to an easement Whitfield had previously obtained \r\n  from Willard, a portion of Tract G drained through a ditch situated alongside \r\n  Tract E. In order to fully develop the property, Tracts A and E had to be built \r\n  up and drainage from the offsite acreage and Tracts A and E had to be rerouted. \r\n  Forsberg Engineering therefore designed a series of detention ponds connected \r\n  by underground pipes from the upper boundary of Tract F down to the culvert \r\n  under Ashley Phosphate Road. The design plans included an eight-acre detention \r\n  pond situated partially on Tract E, which was owned by the Developer, but mostly \r\n  on the adjoining Tract F, which belonged to Whitfield but was under option to \r\n  the Developer. The detention pond was to be used to control surface water runoff \r\n  from the culvert under Ashley Phosphate Road. The plan also called for the excavated \r\n  material from the detention pond to be used as foundation material for Tracts \r\n  A and E. During the time Forsberg Engineering was designing the infrastructure, \r\n  Whitfield attended at least two conferences during which the site plans revealing \r\n  the location of the detention pond were discussed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUsing its own resources, the Developer \r\n  began excavating the detention pond in 1987. During the excavation, which continued \r\n  throughout the spring of 1988, Whitfield regularly visited the site, reviewed \r\n  construction drawings, and guided the Developer's project manager and grading \r\n  contractor on the use of some of the excavation material. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn January 1988, the Developer obtained \r\n  a $20,000,000.00 loan from BOTT for construction of the shopping center. As \r\n  security for the loan, the Developer mortgaged Tracts A and E to BOTT. The loan \r\n  documents for the project required the Developer to construct the shopping mall \r\n  according to plans approved by BOTT. In addition, BOTT retained a construction \r\n  consultant, Construction Analysis Systems, Inc. (CASI), to monitor construction \r\n  of the project and submit monthly inspection reports. The funds from the loan, \r\n  however, were to be used solely for construction of the shopping center on Tracts \r\n  A and E; none of the loan funds were designated for use in installing the infrastructure \r\n  on the optioned property. In fact, installation of the stormwater drainage system, \r\n  sewer and water lines, and detention pond had been substantially completed when \r\n  the Developer obtained the loan from BOTT. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring installation of the drainage \r\n  system, the Developer also installed sewer lines, water lines, and roadways, \r\n  and cut and graded throughout the 249-acre tract. In June 1988, the Developer \r\n  conveyed the completed sewer system to Dorchester County. In February 1989, \r\n  the Developer conveyed the completed water system, which parallels the sewer \r\n  lines throughout the entire tract, to the Commissioner of Public Works for the \r\n  City of Charleston. To facilitate the conveyance of the water system, both the \r\n  Developer and Whitfield granted the City easements through the purchased and \r\n  optioned properties. As well, for purposes of dedicating roadways constructed \r\n  on the optioned property to the public, Whitfield signed three plats, one of \r\n  which shows the boundaries of the detention pond extending onto Tract F. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFrom the time of the execution of \r\n  the purchase-option agreement until October 1988, the Developer made monthly \r\n  option payments of $23,770.00 to Whitfield. Sometime later, however, the Developer \r\n  began experiencing financial difficulties and discontinued the option payments. \r\n  As a result, the Developer never exercised its option to purchase Tracts F and \r\n  G and Whitfield retained title to this property. In 1989, the Developer defaulted \r\n  on its loan agreement with BOTT. Thereafter, Festival Center Associates (Festival) \r\n  assumed the note and mortgage and became owner of the shopping center property. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDuring construction of the shopping \r\n  center, the Developer paved a portion of Lincoln Boulevard. Because of financial \r\n  difficulties, however, neither the Developer nor Festival completely paved the \r\n  roadbed, and the roadbed was therefore never open to the public. Because the \r\n  Developer did not purchase the optioned property, Whitfield was left with ownership \r\n  of Tracts F and G, with Tract G bisected by an unpaved and abandoned roadway. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nTo remedy the situation, Whitfield \r\n  approached Festival with a proposal that he would purchase from Festival a two-acre \r\n  outparcel of wetlands located on the shopping center property. Festival agreed \r\n  to sell the property to Whitfield for $40,000.00, with the understanding that \r\n  Festival would apply the proceeds from the sale to the cost of paving the unpaved \r\n  portion of Lincoln Boulevard. Whitfield would then sell the filled wetlands \r\n  outparcel and likewise apply the proceeds to the balance of the cost of paving \r\n  Lincoln Boulevard. In furtherance of this plan, Whitfield obtained approval \r\n  from the Army Corps of Engineers to fill the wetlands by agreeing in mitigation \r\n  to enlarge several other wetlands situated on Tracts F and G.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMonths later, however, a contract \r\n  was drafted whereby Whitfield proposed he would pay $90,000.00 for the outparcel \r\n  and Festival would pay all the paving costs. By increasing the cost of the lot \r\n  to him, Whitfield would receive an enhanced basis in the property, thus decreasing \r\n  the tax liability he would incur when he eventually sold it. This new arrangement \r\n  would also decrease Whitfield's share of the paving costs. Conversely, however, \r\n  the increase in the purchase price of the outparcel would increase Festival's \r\n  tax liability on the sale. In addition, because the proposed contract required \r\n  Festival to apply the sales proceeds to a capital expenditure, i.e., \r\n  the costs of paving Lincoln Boulevard, it would have to depreciate the investment \r\n  over the life of the road, thus leaving it with substantial income subject to \r\n  taxation without compensating revenue.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe parties were unable to finalize \r\n  negotiations, and Festival eventually defaulted on its loan agreement with BOTT. \r\n  In July 1991, BOTT foreclosed on Tracts A and E and assigned its foreclosure \r\n  rights to Merit Realty Holding Company.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn October 1991, Whitfield called \r\n  Brian Doran, BOTT's New York counsel. According to Doran, Whitfield first asked \r\n  him whether BOTT knew that stormwater was draining from the foreclosed property \r\n  onto Whitfield's property and, after Doran was unable to give a definite answer, \r\n  inquired if Doran was aware of the proposed agreement with Festival. Doran contacted \r\n  BOTT about the prospective sale of the wetlands outparcel to Whitfield, but \r\n  BOTT indicated it had no interest in consummating the deal. Whitfield continued \r\n  to call Doran for about six months to inquire whether BOTT would complete the \r\n  transaction. Doran answered BOTT was not interested. Around the middle of 1992, \r\n  when Doran told Whitfield BOTT was unwilling to complete a transaction to which \r\n  it was not a party, Whitfield informed Doran that \"he [Whitfield] might be forced \r\n  to plug up the retention pond to prevent storm water from coming over from the \r\n  Festival property onto the lake property. And if that didn't get the bank's \r\n  attention, he might have to hire a lawyer and commence litigation.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhitfield then contacted Daniel Forsberg \r\n  of Forsberg Engineering to determine whether or not the Developer or Festival \r\n  had obtained a sewer easement for the line crossing his property. Upon learning \r\n  that no such easement could be located, Whitfield told Forsberg that Festival \r\n  had reneged on the agreement concerning the outparcel and \"he was going to get \r\n  a lawyer and get those old boys' attention.\" \r\n   \r\nWhitfield filed this action September \r\n  9, 1992, alleging the Developer, with BOTT's knowledge and consent: (1) had \r\n  negligently and recklessly destroyed the drainage easement located on Tract \r\n  E; (2) had committed trespass by installing sewer lines and constructing the \r\n  detention pond on Whitfield's property without Whitfield's knowledge or consent; \r\n  (3) had converted materials excavated from the detention pond to construct the \r\n  foundation of the shopping center; and (4) had committed a continuing trespass \r\n  by collecting surface water runoff from the shopping center and diverting it \r\n  in a concentrated form into the detention pond. BOTT's answer, filed December \r\n  17, 1992, alleged general denials and several defenses, namely: (1) failure \r\n  to state a cause of action; (2) failure to join the necessary parties; (3) intervening, \r\n  superseding cause; (4) failure to mitigate damages; (5) laches; and (6) estoppel. \r\n  On April 28, 1994, BOTT moved to amend its answer to add a counterclaim for \r\n  unjust enrichment based on its theory that Whitfield benefitted in various ways \r\n  from the development of the shopping center. By order dated June 9, 1994, the \r\n  circuit court permitted the amendment. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBOTT and Whitfield filed cross-motions \r\n  for summary judgment, and both motions were heard on August 29, 1995. The circuit \r\n  court declined to grant either motion for summary judgment, and the parties \r\n  later consented to have the case referred with finality to the special referee. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 26, 1996, BOTT again moved \r\n  to amend its pleadings, this time to include the statute of limitations as a \r\n  defense and adding a counterclaim for abuse of process. In the abuse of process \r\n  counterclaim, BOTT asserted Whitfield filed suit in an attempt to coerce BOTT \r\n  into paving Lincoln Boulevard. Over Whitfield's objection, the special referee \r\n  allowed the amendment.  \r\n   \r\nThe special referee held the merits \r\n  hearing on July 22-24, 1996. Before the special referee took testimony, Whitfield \r\n  moved, among other things, to strike BOTT's counterclaims because of BOTT's \r\n  refusal to respond to a discovery request for an admission that, during settlement \r\n  negotiations, Whitfield refused an offer by BOTT to pave Lincoln Boulevard. \r\n  In response to the motion, BOTT stipulated its proof on the counterclaim for \r\n  abuse of process would not involve anything that took place after the start \r\n  of the lawsuit.  \r\n   \r\nIn addition, Whitfield abandoned \r\n  all his causes of action except for those concerning the location of the detention \r\n  pond and the runoff of water from the shopping center into the pond. BOTT abandoned \r\n  its counterclaim for unjust enrichment and, at the close of trial, amended its \r\n  answer to include a counterclaim for attorney fees and costs under the South \r\n  Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Toward the end of the trial, Whitfield \r\n  moved to strike the counterclaim for abuse of process. This time, however, Whitfield's \r\n  motion was based on the expiration of the statute of limitations. In response \r\n  to this motion, counsel for BOTT stated only that he made the decision to bring \r\n  the counterclaim because of representations made by Daniel Forsberg during the \r\n  prior year. \r\n   \r\nBy order dated December 6, 1996, \r\n  the special referee dismissed Whitfield's claims, finding BOTT, as the construction \r\n  lender and owner by foreclosure, was not responsible for the detention pond \r\n  or liable for any continuing trespass on Whitfield's property. Moreover, the \r\n  special referee found that, pursuant to the terms of the purchase-option agreement: \r\n  (1) Whitfield had expressly and impliedly granted the Developer an easement \r\n  to construct the detention pond on the optioned property; (2) Whitfield's claims \r\n  were barred by the doctrine of laches; and (3) Whitfield's claims were barred \r\n  by the doctrine of estoppel.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased on these findings, the special \r\n  referee held BOTT was entitled to recover $240,000.00 in actual damages and \r\n  $480,000.00 in punitive damages for abuse of process, as well as $240,000.00 \r\n  in attorney fees for its counterclaim under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil \r\n  Proceedings Sanctions Act. The special referee then awarded BOTT judgment of \r\n  $240,000.00 in actual damages and attorney fees and $480,000.00 in punitive \r\n  damages. After granting Whitfield a hearing on the attorney fees awarded under \r\n  the Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act, the special referee granted BOTT \r\n  judgment for additional attorney fees and costs under the Act in the amount \r\n  of $286,463.32. As to Whitfield's argument that the statute of limitations had \r\n  run on BOTT's counterclaim for abuse of process, the special referee held BOTT's \r\n  amendment to add this counterclaim related back to the date of its original \r\n  pleadings. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Trespass Claims \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Whitfield argues the special \r\n  referee erred in dismissing the trespass claims against BOTT. In support of \r\n  this argument, Whitfield contends: (1) BOTT, through its loan documents and \r\n  CASI inspection reports, knowingly required the Developer to construct the detention \r\n  pond on Whitfield's property and (2) BOTT, as successor owner by way of foreclosure, \r\n  continued to enjoy the benefits of the drainage pit on Whitfield's property \r\n  without paying for it. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGenerally, a construction lender \r\n  is not responsible for the torts of the borrower unless the lender is involved \r\n  in, or exercises control over, construction to an extent that exceeds the degree \r\n  of involvement normally expected of a commercial lender.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the record is devoid of any \r\n  evidence suggesting BOTT exercised excessive control over the Developer's offsite \r\n  construction activities. Excavation of the detention pond had already commenced \r\n  and was substantially underway when the Developer obtained the loan from BOTT. \r\n  The Developer did not use any of the loan funds to complete the excavation. \r\n  Moreover, the terms of the loan documents did not impose any new conditions \r\n  concerning the Developer's offsite activities, but related solely to the development \r\n  of the shopping center site and simply required the Developer to follow the \r\n  plans and specifications it had submitted to BOTT to obtain the loan. Imposing \r\n  such a requirement is a typical lender practice that alone will not subject \r\n  the lender to liability as a co-developer. Indeed, even the inclusion of the \r\n  right on the part of the lender to approve changes in construction suggests \r\n  only the potential for control. Absent the actual exercise of such control, \r\n  the lender does not subject itself to liability.(3)\r\nMoreover, BOTT's act of hiring CASI \r\n  to monitor construction does not exceed the degree of involvement normally expected \r\n  of a commercial lender. The supreme court has expressly characterized such activity \r\n  as a typical lender practice.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhitfield further contends BOTT is \r\n  liable for its own continued trespass from 1991, when BOTT foreclosed on the \r\n  shopping center property, until 1996, when it sold the property. We disagree. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAssuming without deciding that a \r\n  trespass to Whitfield's land occurred, the act constituting the trespass was \r\n  completed before BOTT acquired Tracts A and E by foreclosure. The location of \r\n  the detention pond is permanent. The comprehensive drainage system has been \r\n  approved by both county and municipal authorities and cannot be changed without \r\n  their authorization. The system controls drainage not only from the shopping \r\n  center site, but also from portions of the formerly optioned property and about \r\n  150 acres of offsite property. Furthermore, the detention pond may be classified \r\n  as a wetland, for which alterations cannot be made without consulting the Army \r\n  Corps of Engineers. After acquiring the land, BOTT could not simply \"undo\" the \r\n  alleged trespass.(5) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause we hold the special referee \r\n  properly determined BOTT did not incur liability for the alleged trespass through \r\n  either its role as lender or its status as subsequent owner by foreclosure, \r\n  we decline to address the special referee's findings concerning the grant of \r\n  an easement and the applicability of the doctrines of laches and estoppel.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn addition, we do not address Whitfield's \r\n  arguments concerning the exception to the common enemy rule and the allegedly \r\n  gratuitous benefit BOTT has received from the use of the drainage pit. The special \r\n  referee did not rule on either of these arguments, and, as far as we can tell, \r\n  Whitfield did not raise them in any post-trial motion.(6) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nII. Award Under the South Carolina \r\n  Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhitfield also asserts BOTT's failure \r\n  to obtain summary judgment bars recovery under the South Carolina Frivolous \r\n  Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act.(7) We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Act, provides, in part, as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLiability for attorney's \r\n  fees and costs of frivolous suits.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAny person who takes part in the \r\n  procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding is \r\n  subject to being assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorney's \r\n  fees and court costs of the other party if: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) he does so primarily for a purpose \r\n  other than that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication \r\n  of the claim upon which the proceedings are based; and \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(2) the proceedings have terminated \r\n  in favor of the person seeking an assessment of the fees and costs.(8) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe Act also provides, however, that \r\n  a party \"must be considered to have acted to secure a proper purpose . . . if \r\n  he reasonably believes in the existence of facts upon which his claim is based\" \r\n  and \"(1) reasonably believes under the facts that his claim may be valid under \r\n  existing or developing law, or (2) relies upon the advice of counsel, sought \r\n  in good faith and given after full disclosure of all facts within his knowledge.\"(9) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe special referee concluded Whitfield's \r\n  primary purpose in instituting and continuing these proceedings was not to obtain \r\n  the relief sought in the complaint, but to coerce BOTT into conveying a wetland \r\n  outparcel and paving Lincoln Boulevard. The special referee also found Whitfield's \r\n  allegations concerning the Developer's installation of the sewer lines, use \r\n  of the fill dirt from the pond, and alleged interference with an easement were \r\n  without merit.  \r\n   \r\nPreviously, however, at the hearing \r\n  on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court had declined \r\n  to issue a ruling from the bench and requested counsel to submit proposed orders. \r\n  It appears the parties later agreed to have the case referred to the special \r\n  referee for a full merits hearing and did not pursue their respective motions. \r\n  As a result, the circuit court apparently never issued an order on the summary \r\n  judgment motions.  \r\n   \r\nWhitfield contends that, because \r\n  BOTT's summary judgment motion was not successful, his claims cannot be deemed \r\n  frivolous within the meaning of the Act. We agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Hanahan v. Simpson,(10) \r\n  which was decided after the trial of this case, the supreme court acknowledged \r\n  \"a split of authority [among other jurisdictions] as to whether sanctions may \r\n  be awarded under Frivolous Proceedings acts notwithstanding the denial of summary \r\n  judgment.\"(11) In that case, the supreme court \r\n  concurred with the view \"that a party who survives pre-trial motions to dismiss \r\n  and for summary judgment [is] not subject to sanctions under the Act after a \r\n  trial on the surviving claims\" even though that party did not prevail on those \r\n  issues at the merits hearing.(12) The supreme \r\n  court further reasoned \"[i]t is simply untenable to suggest that, notwithstanding \r\n  the trial court was convinced the issue was one for the jury, Hanahan [the nonprevailing \r\n  party at trial] did not reasonably believe in the existence of her claim.\"(13) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBOTT argues Hanahan does not \r\n  preclude an award of attorney fees in this case because here the circuit court \r\n  did not issue a written order denying its motion for summary judgment. The absence \r\n  of a written order, however, is not dispositive of the issue. Hanahan \r\n  requires only that claims \"survive\" a motion for summary judgment in order to \r\n  preclude attorney fees under the Act. Without question, Whitfield's causes of \r\n  action \"survived\" BOTT's summary judgment motion in that the case was referred \r\n  to the special referee for a full merits hearing. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBOTT also alleges this case is distinguishable \r\n  from Hanahan in that Whitfield presented no independent evidence upon \r\n  which he could reasonably base a belief that his claims were valid. We disagree. \r\n  The supreme court unequivocally rejected the line of authority holding that \r\n  \"the denial of a directed verdict or summary judgment motion does not preclude \r\n  a later determination that the plaintiff's claims were frivolous and groundless.\"(14) \r\n  Although the supreme court noted with approval that the nonprevailing party \r\n  in Hanahan had \"clearly submitted evidence supporting her claims,\"(15) \r\n  this was merely an additional factor showing that she had pursued her claims \r\n  to secure a proper purpose.(16) Nowhere in the \r\n  opinion does the supreme court suggest that, in the absence of such evidence, \r\n  the theory \"that if a case is submitted to the jury, it cannot be deemed frivolous\"(17) \r\n  would not apply. \r\n   \r\nAdhering to the holding in Hanahan, \r\n  we therefore reverse the sanctions awarded under the South Carolina Frivolous \r\n  Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. We decline to address Whitfield's other exceptions \r\n  concerning the award of attorney fees under the Act.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Abuse of Process and the Statute \r\n  of Limitations \r\n   \r\nWhitfield contends the evidence does \r\n  not support a finding that his actions amounted to an abuse of process. He further \r\n  argues the statute of limitations bars BOTT's counterclaim for abuse of process. \r\n  We agree with Whitfield that BOTT's counterclaim for abuse of process is time-barred \r\n  and do not reach the merits of this cause of action. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 26, 1996, more than three \r\n  years after this lawsuit began, BOTT sought leave to amend its pleadings to \r\n  add a counterclaim for abuse of process. At the final hearing, before the special \r\n  referee took testimony, BOTT, apparently for strategic reasons, announced that \r\n  proof of its counterclaim for abuse of process was not based on the settlement \r\n  negotiations or anything that took place after the litigation began. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the close of the evidence, Whitfield \r\n  moved to dismiss BOTT's counterclaim for abuse of process on the ground that \r\n  it was untimely.(18) In the appealed order, \r\n  the special referee held the amendment to add BOTT's counterclaim for abuse \r\n  of process \"relate[d] back to the date of the original pleadings in 1992\" because \r\n  it \"ar[ose] out of the filing of this litigation.\" We agree with Whitfield, \r\n  however, that the amendment did not relate back to any of BOTT's prior pleadings. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn amendment to a pleading relates \r\n  back to the date of the original pleading \"[w]henever the claim or defense asserted \r\n  in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence \r\n  set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleadings.\"(19) \r\n  The central requirement here is that the party defending against the new \r\nclaim have sufficient notice of it, \r\n  i.e.,\"the new claim must be 'logically related' to the matters \r\n  originally pleaded so that the defendant is not prejudiced by the new claim \r\n  asserted after the statute of limitations has expired.\"(20) \r\n  In federal practice, the factors to determine whether or not a claim arose out \r\n  of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the original pleading \r\n  include: (1) whether the party defending against the new claim had notice of \r\n  it; (2) whether the party seeking to add the new claim will rely on the same \r\n  kind of evidence offered in support of the original claim to prove the new claim; \r\n  and (3) whether unfair surprise to the defending party would result if the amendment \r\n  were to relate back.(21)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAbuse of process has been defined \r\n  as \"'the employment of legal process for some purpose other than that [for] \r\n  which it was intended by the law to effect - the improper use of a regularly \r\n  issued process.'\"(22) The elements of abuse \r\n  of process are \"an ulterior purpose and a willful act in the use of the process \r\n  not proper in the regular course of the proceeding.\"(23) \r\n  Furthermore, \"[t]he improper purpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain \r\n  a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself.\"(24) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs the special referee held, Whitfield's \r\n  act of filing the complaint for this lawsuit may well have been the basis for \r\n  BOTT's counterclaim for abuse of process. The proper inquiry, however, is whether \r\n  BOTT had ever provided notice in any of its prior pleadings that it intended \r\n  to allege such a counterclaim, not whether Whitfield should have anticipated \r\n  that the counterclaim would follow as a result of his own actions. In its first \r\n  responsive pleading, BOTT averred only general denials and certain defenses. \r\n  BOTT's first amended answer and counterclaim added a counterclaim for unjust \r\n  enrichment and requested a set-off, but was otherwise substantially similar \r\n  to its earlier pleading. Nowhere in either pleading did BOTT even remotely suggest \r\n  Whitfield made an improper use of a process to gain a collateral advantage. \r\n  Without any indication in its prior responsive pleadings that Whitfield was \r\n  to defend against such an allegation, we fail to see how BOTT had set forth, \r\n  or even attempted to set forth, the conduct, transaction, or occurrence giving \r\n  rise to a counterclaim for abuse of process. The special referee, then, erred \r\n  in concluding BOTT's counterclaim for abuse of process related back to the filing \r\n  date of any of its prior pleadings.(25)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere seems to be no serious dispute \r\n  that BOTT knew or should have known it had a cause of action for abuse of process \r\n  when the complaint for this action was filed.(26) \r\n  The question of whether the amendment resulted in actual prejudice to Whitfield \r\n  is not a factor in determining whether the counterclaim is barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations. Either it is or it isn't.(27) \r\n  Because BOTT did not assert its counterclaim until after the expiration of the \r\n  statute of limitations, we reverse the special referee's awards of actual and \r\n  punitive damages to BOTT for abuse of process. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART. \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n   \r\n1.

In our view, however, that case is distinguishable in that it \r\n  appears to concern only the assertion of a counterclaim in the initial responsive \r\n  pleadings rather than an attempt to add a counterclaim by amendment. In our \r\n  view, the more apt rule for the present case is set forth in Banco Para el \r\n  Comercio Exterior de Cuba v. First National City Bank, 744 F.2d 237 (2d \r\n  Cir. 1984). There, the second circuit court of appeals, in holding an amendment \r\n  to include a counterclaim for a setoff related back to the date of a prior responsive \r\n  pleading, stated: \r\n   \r\n \"To view [Rules 13(f) and 15] as \r\n  mutually exclusive makes little sense . . . in light of the express reference \r\n  in Rule 13(f) to adding the omitted counterclaim \"by amendment.\" The \r\n  better approach . . . is to construe both rules together so that Rule 13(f) \r\n  supplements the general provisions of Rule 15 by setting forth a particular \r\n  standard for allowing the late assertion of omitted counterclaims. Once the \r\n  standard set forth in Rule13(f) is satisfied and leave of court to set up the \r\n  omitted counterclaim is granted, the remaining provisions of Rule 15 should \r\n  be fully applicable and the amendment should relate back if it meets the \r\n  test provided by Rule 15(c).\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 243 (quoting Charles \r\n  Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 1430, at 159-60 \r\n  (1971) (brackets, ellipses, and first emphasis in original; second emphasis \r\n  added; footnote omitted in original)). \r\n26.

Clarkson contends his oral waiver of indictment failed to comply with statutory \r\n  requirements thus rendering the circuit court without jurisdiction to hear his \r\n  guilty plea to assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN). \r\n  We agree.(1) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nClarkson furnished alcoholic beverages \r\n  to five minor, male victims and bought the victims numerous gifts. Clarkson \r\n  performed oral sex on two victims. He also grabbed one victim's genitals which \r\n  served as the basis for the ABHAN charge.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe grand jury indicted Clarkson \r\n  for two counts of second degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor, \r\n  eleven counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and one count of \r\n  assault with intent to commit second degree CSC with a minor. However, Clarkson \r\n  pled guilty to two counts of second degree CSC with a minor, eleven counts of \r\n  contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and one count of ABHAN. Because \r\n  Clarkson pled to a non-indicted offense, ABHAN, the trial judge explained Clarkson's \r\n  right to have a grand jury present a formal indictment for the ABHAN charge. \r\n  In open court and on the record, Clarkson orally waived his right to a formal \r\n  indictment. The trial judge accepted Clarkson's plea and sentenced him to twenty \r\n  years for each count of second degree CSC with a minor, two years for each count \r\n  of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and five years for ABHAN, with \r\n  all the sentences to run concurrently. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nClarkson's counsel filed an appeal \r\n  pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967). We directed the \r\n  parties to brief two issues: (1) whether Clarkson's oral waiver of indictment \r\n  in open court transcribed by the court reporter constituted a sufficient written \r\n  waiver of indictment and (2) whether ABHAN constitutes a lesser included offense \r\n  of assault with intent to commit second degree CSC with a minor. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe first address Clarkson's contention \r\n  the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear his guilty plea \r\n  to ABHAN because Clarkson's oral waiver of indictment failed to satisfy statutory \r\n  requirements. See Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 777 (1998) (\"Issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised \r\n  at any time.\"). \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina's criminal code requires \r\n  a defendant to sign a written waiver of indictment before pleading guilty to \r\n  an indictment not presented to the grand jury. Summerall v. State, 278 \r\n  S.C. 255, 256, 294 S.E.2d 344 (1982); see also Phillips v. State, \r\n  281 S.C. 41, 42, 314 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1984) (\"By their plain language, Â§Â§ 17-23-130 \r\n  and 140 make a written waiver of presentment of indictments not presented to \r\n  a grand jury mandatory before the trial judge can accept the plea.\" (quoting \r\n  Summerall, 278 S.C. at 256, 294 S.E.2d at 344)). Although Clarkson's \r\n  trial transcript arguably produced a written waiver of indictment, Clarkson \r\n  never signed a written waiver. The South Carolina Supreme Court strictly construes \r\n  the requirement of a signed, written waiver of indictment. See Summerall, \r\n  278 S.C. 255, 294 S.E.2d 344 (holding a guilty plea invalid where appellant \r\n  failed to sign a waiver of indictment because of an administrative error); State \r\n  v. McNeil, 314 S.C. 473, 475, 445 S.E.2d 461, 462 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting \r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court strictly construes the requirement of a written \r\n  waiver of indictment). Therefore, Clarkson's oral waiver of indictment failed \r\n  to comply with statutory requirements.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause Clarkson's attempted waiver \r\n  of indictment is invalid, we must vacate his guilty plea to ABHAN unless ABHAN \r\n  is a lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit second degree \r\n  CSC with a minor. See Carter 329 S.C. at 362, 495 S.E.2d at \r\n  777 (noting a circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a guilty \r\n  plea when the crime pled to is a lesser included offense of the crime indicted \r\n  for). \r\n   \r\n\"The test for determining when a \r\n  crime is a lesser included offense is whether the greater of the two offenses \r\n  includes all the elements of the lesser offense.\" Carter, 329 S.C. at \r\n  363, 495 S.E.2d at 777. Therefore, intent to commit second degree CSC with a \r\n  minor must contain all the elements of ABHAN for ABHAN to constitute a lesser \r\n  included offense of assault with intent to commit second degree CSC with a minor. \r\n  See State v. Elliott, 335 S.C. 512, 517 S.E.2d 713, 714 (1999) \r\n  (analyzing whether ABHAN constituted a lesser included offense of assault with \r\n  intent to commit third degree CSC). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBattery is an element of ABHAN. Elliott, \r\n  supra. Battery is not an element of assault with intent to commit second \r\n  degree CSC with a minor. Id. (holding battery is not an element of assault \r\n  with intent to commit third degree CSC); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-656 (1985); see \r\n  also State v. Morris, 289 S.C. 294, 295 n.1, 345 S.E.2d 477 n.1 \r\n  (1986) (noting battery is not a necessary element of assault with intent to \r\n  commit CSC).(3) Therefore, ABHAN fails to constitute \r\n  a lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit second degree CSC \r\n  with a minor and the circuit court was without jurisdiction to accept Clarkson's \r\n  guilty plea to ABHAN. See Carter, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause Clarkson's waiver of indictment \r\n  was procedurally deficient and ABHAN fails to constitute a lesser included offense \r\n  of assault with intent to commit second degree CSC with a minor, the circuit \r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Clarkson's guilty plea to ABHAN. \r\n  See Carter, supra. We therefore vacate Clarkson's guilty \r\n  plea to ABHAN. \r\n   \r\nClarkson further contends vacating \r\n  the ABHAN conviction necessitates vacating his remaining guilty pleas, arguing \r\n  all pleas were entered into as a package deal. We find no merit to this contention. \r\n  The trial judge conducted a thorough guilty plea hearing and Clarkson failed \r\n  to object at any time during the hearing. See State v. Hoffman, \r\n  312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (holding a contemporaneous objection \r\n  is required to properly preserve an error for appellate review and an issue \r\n  which is not properly preserved cannot be raised for the first time on appeal). \r\n  Therefore, we uphold the remaining guilty pleas. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVACATED IN PART \r\n  AND AFFIRMED IN PART. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, J.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  We decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  While certain \r\n  states do permit a defendant to orally waive his right to indictment in open \r\n  court, rather than through signing a written waiver, those states provide for \r\n  such procedure by statutory or constitutional provision. An illustrative, although \r\n  not comprehensive, list follows. See, e.g., Miss. Const. art. III, \r\n  Â§ 27 (\"No person shall, for any indictable offense, be proceeded against criminally \r\n  by information, except . . . where a defendant represented by counsel by sworn \r\n  statement waives indictment.\"); N.M. Const. art. XX, Â§ 20 (\"Any person held \r\n  by a committing magistrate to await the action of the grand jury on a charge \r\n  of felony or other infamous crime, may in open court with the consent of the \r\n  court and the district attorney, to be entered upon the record, waive indictment \r\n  and plead to an information in the form of an indictment filed by the district \r\n  attorney. . . .\"); Delaware Super. Ct. Crim. Rule 7(b) (\"An offense within the \r\n  exclusive jurisdiction of Superior Court other than a capital crime may be prosecuted \r\n  by information if the defendant, after having been advised of the nature of \r\n  the charge and of the rights of the defendant, waives in writing or in \r\n  open court prosecution by indictment.\" (emphasis added)); District of Columbia \r\n  Super. Ct. Rules of Crim. P. 7(b) (\"An offense which may be punished by imprisonment \r\n  for a term exceeding 1 year may be prosecuted by information if the defendant, \r\n  after having been advised of the nature of the charge and of the rights of the \r\n  defendant, waives in open court prosecution by indictment.\"); Tex. Crim. P. \r\n  Code Ann. art. 1.141 (West 1997) (\"A person represented by legal counsel may \r\n  in open court or by written instrument voluntarily waive the right to be accused \r\n  by indictment of any offense other than a capital felony.\"); Jefferson v. \r\n  Mississippi, 556 So.2d 1016 (Miss. 1989) (finding a sufficient waiver of \r\n  indictment where defendant appeared before the court under oath and entered \r\n  a guilty plea to grand larceny even though charged with the burglary of two \r\n  automobiles); but see Balkcom v. McDaniel, 216 S.E.2d 328 (Ga. \r\n  1975) (holding a specific written waiver of indictment is not required when \r\n  defendant is pleading guilty to a non-capital felony even though the relevant \r\n  statute required a written waiver (citing a precursor to Ga. Code Ann. Â§ 17-7-70 \r\n  (1998) which now states: \"In all felony cases, other than cases involving capital \r\n  felonies, . . . the district attorney shall have authority to prefer accusations, \r\n  and such defendants shall be tried on such accusations, provided that defendants \r\n  going to trial under such accusations shall, in writing, waive indictment by \r\n  a grand jury.\")). \r\n3.  In State \r\n  v. Morris, 289 S.C. 294, 345 S.E.2d 477 (1986), the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court implicitly upheld a trial court's decision to submit ABHAN to the jury \r\n  as a lesser included offense even though the grand jury indicted defendant for \r\n  assault with intent to commit first degree CSC because, although battery is \r\n  not an element for assault with intent to commit first degree CSC, South Carolina's \r\n  criminal code provides that \"[a]ssault with intent to commit criminal sexual \r\n  conduct . . . shall be punishable as if the criminal sexual conduct was committed.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-656 (1985). However, the Morris case is distinguishable \r\n  from the present case because, in Morris, the original indictment was \r\n  for \"Assault and Battery with Intent to Commit a Sexual Battery.\" Morris, \r\n  289 S.C. at 295 n.1, 345 S.E.2 at 477 n.1. (emphasis added). Clarkson's indictment \r\n  was for assault with intent to commit second degree CSC with a minor, rather \r\n  than assault and battery, thus distinguishing Morris from the present \r\n  case.

Bridges, M.D. appeals the trial court's \r\n  decision to admit evidence of four possible scenarios regarding Belinda Sue \r\n  Pearson's future medical needs and expenses. Bridges claims the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting evidence of future medical expenses that did not reach the \r\n  \"most probable\" standard for admissibility. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPearson sued Bridges for medical \r\n  malpractice after complications from gallbladder surgery. During laparoscopic \r\n  surgery in May 1992, Bridges cut the common bile duct instead of the cystic \r\n  duct as intended. He then had to convert the surgery to an open procedure and \r\n  attempted to repair the common bile duct. After the repair and the surgery were \r\n  finished, a narrowing caused by the buildup of scar tissue known as a \"stricture\" \r\n  formed in the area where the bile duct had been cut. Bridges performed another \r\n  surgery to correct this problem, and a stent was placed in the bile duct. This \r\n  stent became unseated and had to be removed. \r\nPearson was then referred to Dr. \r\n  John Galloway at Emory University. During surgery in September 1993, Dr. Galloway \r\n  placed another stent in Pearson's bile duct. The stent was removed in April \r\n  1994 but the duct strictured once again and another stent was inserted during \r\n  another surgery. This stent was not removed until November 1995. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, evidence was presented \r\n  to show medical costs, pain and suffering, and future medical costs. The present \r\n  and past medical costs amounted to $123,902.72. There was also evidence introduced \r\n  that Pearson incurred lost wages of $64,131.93. Pearson testified as to her \r\n  pain and suffering during the many months of recovery from the numerous surgeries. \r\n  She testified to (1) having tubes in her side; (2) having to have others help \r\n  her with common everyday tasks, such as using the bathroom; and (3) medical \r\n  problems such as high fevers and jaundice. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDr. Galloway testified as to four \r\n  possible scenarios regarding Pearson's required future medical care. An economist, \r\n  Dr. Richard G. Thompson, assigned monetary values to the potential scenarios. \r\n  The possible scenarios introduced at trial were: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario One: Continual monitoring \r\n  of Pearson's condition to prevent any more strictures and complications.\r\nProjected cost: $9473.78. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario Two: If the duct restrictured, \r\n  another cholangioplasty would need to be performed.\r\nProjected cost: $20,107.56. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario Three: If scenario two failed \r\n  and surgery was required. \r\nProjected cost: $38,683.62. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario Four: If scenarios two and \r\n  three failed, Pearson would need a full liver transplant.\r\nProjected cost: $237,128.39. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBridges objected to all testimony \r\n  other than scenario one on the grounds that it did not meet the \"most probable \r\n  to happen\" standard and was inadmissible. The trial court overruled the objection \r\n  and allowed evidence of all four scenarios. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, the jury awarded Pearson \r\n  $755,000 in damages in a general verdict. Bridges does not appeal the finding \r\n  of liability. After the jury verdict, Bridges moved for a new trial nisi \r\n  remittitur, a new trial absolute, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. \r\n  He alleged that the testimony regarding the possible scenarios was prejudicial \r\n  and that the jury's verdict was reached based upon speculation and conjecture. \r\n  The trial court denied all Bridges's motions.\r\n DISCUSSION \r\n   \r\n   \r\nBridges argues that the evidence \r\n  and testimony regarding scenarios two, three, and four were inadmissible because \r\n  they do not meet the most probable standard, thereby causing the jury's verdict \r\n  to be based upon conjecture and surmise. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nClearly, the most probable rule applies \r\n  to testimony given by a medical expert to establish proximate cause in a medical \r\n  malpractice case. Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 473 S.E.2d 793 (1996). \r\n  What is less clear, however, is the standard of proof required before future \r\n  medical expenses may be admitted at trial.(1) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nUnder South Carolina common law, \r\n  future damages are generally allowed in personal injury and medical malpractice \r\n  cases. See Haltiwanger v. Barr, 258 S.C. 27, 186 S.E.2d 819 (1972) \r\n  (holding that future damages may be recovered in a personal injury action so \r\n  long as the damages are reasonably certain to result in the future from the \r\n  injury); see also Ward v. Epting, 290 S.C. 547, 351 S.E.2d 867 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1986) (holding that evidence of loss of future earnings admissible \r\n  in a medical malpractice case).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBridges asserts that the standard \r\n  of proof required to admit evidence of future damages is the same as that required \r\n  to prove causation. We disagree. See Armstrong v. Weiland, 267 \r\n  S.C. 12, 16, 225 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1976) (\"When the testimony of an expert witness \r\n  is not relied upon to establish proximate cause, it is sufficient for plaintiff \r\n  to put forth some evidence which rises above mere speculation or conjecture \r\n  . . . .\"). \r\n   \r\nIn 1995, the court of appeals held \r\n  that the most probable rule did not apply to expert testimony offered for reasons \r\n  other than to prove proximate cause. Payton v. Kearse, 319 S.C. 188, \r\n  210, 460 S.E.2d 220, 233 (Ct. App. 1995). Even though it found the trial court \r\n  wrongly excluded the expert's testimony, the court of appeals did not reverse \r\n  because it found the expert's testimony cumulative and the error, therefore, \r\n  harmless. Id. at 211, 460 S.E.2d at 233.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn reversing the decision of the \r\n  court of appeals, the supreme court found that the trial court properly excluded \r\n  the expert's testimony because it was \"only relevant to the issue of causation.\" \r\n  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 61, 495 S.E.2d 205, 211 (1998). The supreme \r\n  court did not comment on the court of appeals's holding that the most probable \r\n  rule did not apply to expert testimony offered for reasons other than to prove \r\n  proximate cause.  \r\n   \r\nTherefore, expert testimony admitted \r\n  to prove future damages need not meet the most probable standard. To be admissible, \r\n  \"[f]uture damages do not need to be proved to a mathematical certainty. Oftentimes \r\n  a verdict involving future damages must be approximated. A wide latitude is \r\n  allowed the jury.\" Haltiwanger, 258 S.C. at 32-33, 186 S.E.2d at 821. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nEarly South Carolina law held that \r\n  evidence regarding future damages was required to be established with \"reasonable \r\n  certainty.\" Green v. Catawba Power Co., 75 S.C. 102, 55 S.E. 125 (1906). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA later South Carolina case, however, \r\n  held that expert medical testimony regarding future consequences of an injury \r\n  was permitted where such testimony satisfied the rule against speculation and \r\n  was otherwise admissible. Martin v. Mobley, 253 S.C. 103, 169 S.E.2d \r\n  278 (1969); see Phillip E. Hassman, Annotation, Admissibility of Expert \r\n  Medical Testimony as to Future Consequences of Injury as Affected by Expression \r\n  in Terms of Probability or Possibility, 75 A.L.R.3d 9, 24 (1977) (citing \r\n  Martin for the proposition that South Carolina common law follows the \r\n  most lenient admissibility rule regarding such testimony--the \"rule permitting \r\n  all pertinent testimony except speculation.\").(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe think a fair reading of South \r\n  Carolina law illustrates that reasonable certainty is evidence that is beyond \r\n  mere speculation and conjecture but less than that required by the most probable \r\n  standard to prove proximate cause. See Ellis v. Oliver, 323 S.C. \r\n  121, 125, 473 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1996) (In medical malpractice case, distinguishing \r\n  the reasonable certainty requirement of an expert in stating his opinion from \r\n  the most probable standard necessary to prove causation.); see also Mali \r\n  v. Odom, 295 S.C. 78, 367 S.E.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding estimates \r\n  inadmissible as evidence of future lost profits because they made no reference \r\n  to any particular standard of fixed estimation method or any operational history \r\n  and therefore, were speculative).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn personal injury actions, great \r\n  latitude is allowed in the introduction of evidence to aid in determining the \r\n  extent of damages; and as a broad general rule, any evidence which tends to \r\n  establish the nature, character, and extent of injuries which are the natural \r\n  and proximate consequences of defendant's acts is admissible, if otherwise competent. \r\n  Martin, 253 S.C. at 103, 169 S.E.2d at 278. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Martin, the supreme court \r\n  affirmed the trial court when it allowed the plaintiff's expert witness to testify \r\n  that, generally, a patient sustains a 15% permanent disability following surgery \r\n  to repair a herniated disc. Id. at 107, 169 S.E.2d at 280. Although the \r\n  witness was the physician who had performed the surgery, he had not subsequently \r\n  examined the plaintiff to determine the extent of her permanent disability. \r\n  Id. at 108-09, 169 S.E.2d at 281. The court held that the fact that the \r\n  doctor had not had the opportunity to consider whether the plaintiff's permanent \r\n  disability was more or less than that which generally followed such a condition \r\n  and operation affected only the weight, and not the admissibility, of the proffered \r\n  evidence. Id. at 109, 169 S.E.2d at 281. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a personal injury case, the trial \r\n  court permitted an expert physician to testify that the plaintiff's leg would \r\n  be \"more prone\" to circulation problems because of extensive scarring. Campbell \r\n  v. Paschal, 290 S.C. 1, 15, 347 S.E.2d 892, 900 (Ct. App. 1986). The defendant \r\n  contested the trial court's decision to admit testimony regarding the plaintiff's \r\n  future medical expenses on the ground that there was insufficient evidence regarding \r\n  them to let the court submit it to the jury. Id. The court of appeals \r\n  held that evidence that the plaintiff suffered recurring pain and tenderness \r\n  in his leg and that he was likely to suffer circulation problems in the future \r\n  was sufficient to sustain an award that included future damages. Id. \r\n  at 15, 347 S.E.2d at 901.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a medical malpractice case, the \r\n  court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision to admit evidence of lost \r\n  future earnings even though the defendant claimed such evidence was speculative. \r\n  Ward v. Epting, 290 S.C. 547, 558, 351 S.E.2d 867, 873 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\n  In Ward, the deceased's husband testified that the deceased intended \r\n  to return to work once their son, ten weeks old at the time of her death, was \r\n  six months old. Id. The deceased's former employer was also permitted \r\n  to testify that he intended to rehire the deceased. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn another medical malpractice case, \r\n  the court of appeals determined that an expert economist had a \"sufficient\" \r\n  basis to calculate present cost of future medical supplies needed for the plaintiff \r\n  but did not mention any requirement for such evidence to meet the most probable \r\n  standard. James v. Lister, 331 S.C. 277, 500 S.E.2d 198 (Ct. App. 1998), \r\n  cert. denied (Mar. 5, 1999). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA question of future damages was \r\n  held properly submitted to a jury where the expert physician testified the plaintiff \r\n  \"may need further treatment in the future.\" Daniels v. Bernard, 270 S.C. \r\n  51, 56, 240 S.E.2d 518, 520 (1978). In fact, the supreme court held that the \r\n  plaintiff's testimony alone was evidence of future pain and suffering sufficient \r\n  to send the issue of future damages to the jury. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA persuasive case regarding testimony \r\n  that included different scenarios for future damages is International Wood \r\n  Processors v. Power Dry, Inc., 593 F. Supp. 710 (D.S.C. 1984), aff'd, \r\n  792 F.2d 416 (4th Cir. 1986). In this antitrust case, the district court permitted \r\n  an expert witness to testify regarding lost future profits. The expert presented \r\n  two different financial forecasts for a ten-year period. On appeal, the appellant \r\n  claimed this was error because the respondent failed to prove damages were \"capable \r\n  of reasonable ascertainment.\" International Wood, 792 F.2d at 431. The \r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and held that the trial court adequately \r\n  considered the expert's assumptions and the jury reasonably could have accepted \r\n  the expert's projections. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the trial court permitted Dr. \r\n  Galloway to testify regarding four possible future scenarios. Dr. Galloway made \r\n  it clear that scenario one was the most likely case scenario while scenario \r\n  four was the least likely case scenario. Dr. Galloway stated that Pearson's \r\n  condition would definitely require monitoring for the rest of her life. He stated \r\n  that there was a 25-30% chance of restricturing of the common bile duct, thus \r\n  necessitating the need for at least scenario two. In discussing scenario four, \r\n  Dr. Galloway testified that much would have to go wrong before a liver transplant \r\n  would be required, but he could not say that it was certain not to happen. On \r\n  the other hand, Bridge's expert witness testified that in his opinion Pearson \r\n  would never require a liver transplant.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe jury was provided with evidence \r\n  of the four scenarios, and both sides had ample opportunity to discuss the likelihood \r\n  of each scenario occurring. This evidence was properly submitted to the jury \r\n  for its consideration. See Kelly v. Brazell, 253 S.C. 564, 567-68, \r\n  172 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1970) (\"[T]he fact that future medical expense . . . are \r\n  difficult to estimate would not deprive the plaintiff of the right to have the \r\n  jury determine whether any award for future medical be made, and if so, what \r\n  amount. The trial judge charged the jury that an award could not be based on \r\n  speculation and that damages must be proved by the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  He also left it to the jury to determine whether need of future treatment had \r\n  been proved.\"). \r\n   \r\nThere was no speculation as to the \r\n  cost involved in any future scenario that might occur. Rather, the question \r\n  left to the jury to decide was which, if any, of the scenarios would come to \r\n  pass. As our supreme court has indicated in Haltiwanger, a trial is the \r\n  claimant's only day in court to recover such damages, present and future, as \r\n  the jury determines are reasonably certain to accrue. Haltiwanger v. Barr, \r\n  258 S.C. 27, 32-33, 186 S.E.2d 819, 821 (1972). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the trial court instructed \r\n  the jury that Pearson was not entitled to recover conjectural or speculative \r\n  damages and was only entitled to future damages that were \"reasonably certain \r\n  to occur in the future.\" The trial court stated Pearson was entitled to damages \r\n  \"susceptible to ascertainment with a reasonable certainty\" but that she did \r\n  not have to prove such damages with mathematical certainty. This is the correct \r\n  law in South Carolina. See Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, \r\n  407 S.E.2d 630 (1991) (The jury must be presented with all evidence from which \r\n  it can make a logical, well informed decision. A jury's verdict cannot \"be left \r\n  to conjecture, guess or speculation.\") (quoting Gray v. Southern Facilities, \r\n  Inc., 256 S.C. 558, 183 S.E.2d 438 (1971); see also Winchester \r\n  v. United Ins. Co., 231 S.C. 462, 470, 99 S.E.2d 28, 32 (1957) (\"While the \r\n  mere fact that the determination of future damages may be surrounded with many \r\n  difficulties does not render the courts impotent to grant relief, the proof \r\n  must be established with reasonable certainty and probability that damages will \r\n  result to the person wronged.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn summary, we hold that the most \r\n  probable standard required to prove causation is not the standard to be applied \r\n  in determining the admissibility of evidence of future damages. Rather, the \r\n  evidence must be beyond speculation or conjecture and reasonably certain to \r\n  occur.(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON, J., concurs. ANDERSON, \r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.ANDERSON, J. (dissenting): I respectfully \r\n  dissent. The majority concludes the \"most probable\" standard required to prove \r\n  causation is not the standard to be applied in determining the admissibility \r\n  of evidence of future damages. I disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court permitted Dr. Galloway \r\n  to testify as to four possible scenarios(1d) \r\n  regarding Pearson's required future medical care: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario One: Continual monitoring \r\n  of Pearson's condition to prevent any more strictures and complications. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario Two: If the duct restrictured, \r\n  another cholangioplasty would need to be performed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nScenario Three: If scenario two failed \r\n  and surgery was required. \r\n   \r\nScenario Four: If scenarios two and \r\n  three failed, Pearson would need a full liver transplant. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA paradigm of medical mathematical \r\n  endeavors is presented by the testimony of Dr. Douglas Olsen: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. [T]hat was common bile duct injury, \r\n  wasn't it? \r\n   \r\nA. That is correct. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. That patient also [had] \r\n  a 20 to 30 percent chance of restriction? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Yeah, depending on whose numbers, \r\n  15 to 20, like to use nice broad category. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. You said if it is 15 fine, 35 \r\n  fine, you gave it 20 to 30? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Yeah, somewhere in that ballpark \r\n  range. \r\n   \r\nDr. Olsen's testimony is juxtaposed \r\n  to Dr. Galloway's: \r\n   \r\nQ. Why will you need to keep checking \r\n  her? Are we still worried about a stricture occurring? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. The, the chances that the stricture \r\n  can come back will, you know, be there for an indefinite amount of time. The \r\n  percentage is based on, you know, what little factual data we have here. You \r\n  know, from the, starting from the last time she had the tubes pulled out she \r\n  probably has, you know, 25 to 30 percent chance of re-stricture rate \r\n  and over the next five years following that. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDr. Galloway declared Pearson's condition \r\n  will definitely require monitoring for the rest of her life. He opined there \r\n  was a 25-30% chance of restricturing of the common bile duct, thus necessitating \r\n  the need for at least scenario two. In discussing scenario four, Dr. Galloway \r\n  stated much would have to go wrong before a liver transplant would be required. \r\n  Yet, he could not say scenario four was certain not to happen. Dr. Bridges's \r\n  expert witness testified that in his opinion Pearson would never require a liver \r\n  transplant. \r\n   \r\nThere is no case in South Carolina \r\n  supporting the holding of the majority in permitting the contested evidence \r\n  on damages in this case. The majority cites Payton v. Kearse, 319 S.C. \r\n  188, 460 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1995), Haltiwanger v. Barr, 258 S.C. \r\n  27, 186 S.E.2d 819 (1972), Green v. Catawba Power Co., 75 S.C. 102, \r\n  55 S.E. 125 (1906), and Martin v. Mobley, 253 S.C. 103, 169 S.E.2d \r\n  278 (1969), as support for the admission of the damages evidence. These cases \r\n  do not address the issue involved in this litigation. Apodictically, \r\n  the principles articulated by the cited precedent are recognized without question. \r\n  Payton states the \"most probable rule\" does not apply to expert testimony \r\n  offered for reasons other than proof of proximate cause. Haltiwanger \r\n  simply says \"[f]uture damages do not need to be proved to a mathematical certainty.\" \r\n  Id. at 32, 186 S.E.2d at 821. Green mandates a charge that \r\n  future damages must be proven with \"reasonable certainty.\" Despite an opinion \r\n  emanating from a commentator, Martin is not dispositive in regard to \r\n  the challenged evidence. \r\n   \r\nAcademically, courts in this country \r\n  are divided as to \"the degree of certainty required for an award of future medical \r\n  expenses.\" 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages Â§ 217 (1988). Some courts enunciate \r\n  the test for recovery of damages for future medical care in terms of \"probability\" \r\n  or \"medical probability.\" Id. Â§ 219. Concomitantly, an injured party \r\n  may recover future medical expenses where there has been expert testimony as \r\n  to the probability of continued treatment and medication. Id. Other \r\n  courts utilize terms of \"reasonable probability,\" \"more probable than not,\" \r\n  or a closely synonymous phrase as the evidentiary yardstick for recovery of \r\n  damages for future medical care. The rule espoused in the opinion of the majority \r\n  is that the \"most probable\" standard is not efficacious in considering the admissibility \r\n  of evidence of future damages. Admittedly, some courts do follow this approach \r\n  by allowing evidence of future medical expenses to be bottomed and premised \r\n  upon a \"possibility.\" Id. Â§ 221. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe use of evidentiary scenarios \r\n  embracing \"possibilities\" or mathematical percentages that violate the \"most \r\n  probable rule\" constitutes \"judicial lotto.\" A welter of confusion results from \r\n  the failure to apply the \"most probable rule\" to the admissibility of evidence \r\n  on damages. The quintessential imbroglio involving the admissibility of evidence \r\n  on damages is the nadir of the percentage factor. How low will the percentage \r\n  factor go? In this case, it is \"bench marked\" at 20%. What about 5%? Is there \r\n  an evidentiary \"safety valve\" to eliminate the rankest of verdict speculation? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe abandonment of the \"most probable \r\n  rule\" as the test for admissibility of evidence on future medical expenses opens \r\n  Pandora's box to the vagaries of evidence having its etiology in uncertainty, \r\n  ambiguity, and arbitrariness. The admissibility of this evidence obliterates \r\n  the judicial equipoise inter sese plaintiff and defendant to the point of fundamental \r\n  unfairness. A defendant should not be subjected to the vicissitudes of \r\n  a damage verdict based upon gross speculation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe rule adopted by the majority \r\n  destroys the gatekeeper role of trial judges in guarding against the imposition \r\n  of damages in violation of the \"most probable rule.\" The evisceration of the \r\n  \"most probable rule\" in the damage arena will judicially blight the pristine \r\n  concept of a fair and impartial verdict. A defendant stands mercilessly in the \r\n  face of testimony emanating from a plaintiff who rings the jury \"empathy bell.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe retreat by the majority from \r\n  established evidentiary standards leaves a gargantuan aperture in the presentation \r\n  of \"damage evidence\" to the fact finder. This holding is a harbinger of \"damage \r\n  evidence obfuscation\" in the field of damages. Indubitably, the appellate court \r\n  will rue the day that a landmark rule was eliminated as a protective barrier \r\n  against \"verdict uncertainty.\" In a utilitarian sense, parties will be at liberty \r\n  to shape innumerable and unlimited scenarios as justification for future medical \r\n  expenditures. \r\n   \r\nA plethora of policy considerations \r\n  are triggered in this decision. My concernment is that the integrity of the \r\n  system will be at risk if there is a lack of a definite and certain rule in \r\n  the area of admissibility of evidence on future medical expenses. Today we lift \r\n  the hallowed bar against suppositional medical evidence to prove future medical \r\n  expenses. The majority marches forth into the zone of fortuitous and undivinable \r\n  admissibility.\r\nI would hold the \"most probable rule\" \r\n  is the standard for admissibility of evidence in regard to future medical expenses.\r\n1.  An A.L.R. \r\n  article on the subject states:\r\nAlthough all courts agree that it \r\n  would be improper to award damages covering future medical expenses without \r\n  evidence showing some degree of certainty, probability, or possibility that \r\n  the plaintiff's treatment will continue into the future, the courts do not agree \r\n  as to the degree of certainty required. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDanny R. Veilleux, Annotation, Sufficiency \r\n  of Evidence to Prove Future Medical Expenses as Result of Injury to Back, Neck \r\n  or Spine, 26 A.L.R. 5th 401, 425-26 (1995). \r\n2.  The article \r\n  differentiates between the admissibility of testimony of future damages \r\n  and the amount of evidence needed to prove causation. Hassman, supra, \r\n  at 16. \r\n3.  Bridges does \r\n  not argue that under the \"reasonably certain to occur\" standard the evidence \r\n  in question was inadmissible. \r\n1d. All \r\n  testimony beyond scenario one was objected to by Dr. Bridges on the grounds \r\n  that it did not meet the \"most probable to happen\" standard and was inadmissible. \r\n  The judge overruled the objection and allowed evidence of all four scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3071","title":"Duncan v.

(Sirrine) and Fluor \r\n  Daniel, Inc. summary judgment on Duncan's personal injury claims. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuncan worked as a production coating \r\n  operator for Hoechst Celanese when he entered a production area and climbed \r\n  a set of stairs to the mezzanine level, approximately eight feet above the coating \r\n  machinery. Duncan walked down a narrow catwalk and, as he turned the corner, \r\n  fell through a partially opened hatch door. The fall dislocated Duncan's wrist, \r\n  caused nerve damage, and required surgery to repair his radius bone. Duncan \r\n  subsequently received a ten percent workers' compensation impairment rating. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDuncan sued Sirrine and Fluor Daniel \r\n  alleging Sirrine designed the hatch and Fluor Daniel built the hatch. Duncan's \r\n  suit alleged causes of action for negligence, breach of implied warranty of \r\n  merchantability, breach of implied warranty for a particular purpose, and strict \r\n  liability. Sirrine answered Duncan's complaint and admitted designing the hatch. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDuncan's expert, Charles A. Fletcher, \r\n  testified in deposition that the open hatch violated established standards for \r\n  hatches, walkways, and platforms. Fletcher relied on Occupational Safety and \r\n  Health Administration (OSHA) standards in opining that the hatch should have \r\n  been protected by a person guarding the gate, a mechanical gate guard, or other \r\n  protective mechanism.(1) Fletcher further stated \r\n  the workmanship on the hatch \"appeared to be entirely adequate.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPursuant to requests by both Duncan \r\n  and Sirrine, the circuit court extended discovery an additional sixty days and \r\n  scheduled trial for the term of court beginning September 22, 1997. On September \r\n  19, 1997, Sirrine filed a motion to amend its answer to deny designing the hatch. \r\n  The circuit court granted Sirrine's motion to amend and granted Duncan an additional \r\n  sixty days to conduct discovery.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFluor Daniel then filed a motion \r\n  for summary judgment and submitted an affidavit by J. Greg Denton, Fluor Daniel's \r\n  manager of operations. Denton's affidavit stated Fluor Daniel only provided \r\n  maintenance and fabrication services for Hoechst and never provided any engineering, \r\n  design, or drafting services related to the hatch. Denton asserted that Hoechst \r\n  reviewed Fluor Daniel's installation performance and would not have accepted \r\n  the work if Fluor Daniel's construction failed to meet the design, assembly, \r\n  quality, or safety specifications provided by Hoechst. The circuit court granted \r\n  Fluor Daniel summary judgment. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn December 2, 1997, Duncan requested \r\n  an additional sixty days to conduct discovery on his action against Sirrine. \r\n  On January 22, 1998, Duncan deposed Jeffrey A. Reeves, a structural engineer \r\n  for Sirrine and the most knowledgeable Sirrine employee on whether Sirrine designed \r\n  the hatch allegedly causing Duncan's accident. Reeves stated Sirrine was not \r\n  involved in the design of the platform or hatch allegedly causing Duncan's accident. \r\n  Sirrine then filed a motion for summary judgment which the court granted. Duncan \r\n  appeals. \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuncan first contends Sirrine is \r\n  bound by its original pleadings and the circuit court erred in granting Sirrine's \r\n  motion to amend its answer. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile Duncan asserts Sirrine should \r\n  be bound by its original pleadings, even the cases Duncan relies on as authority \r\n  relieve a party from its original pleadings when the party withdraws or amends \r\n  its pleadings. See, e.g., Elrod v. All, 243 S.C. 425, 436, 134 \r\n  S.E.2d 410, 416 (1964) (\"We consider the pleadings in this case in the light \r\n  of the general rule, that the parties to an action are judicially concluded \r\n  and bound by such unless withdrawn, altered or stricken by amendment or otherwise.\" \r\n  (emphasis added)). Therefore, the issue on appeal is whether the circuit court \r\n  properly granted Sirrine leave to amend its answer. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 15, SCRCP, provides that \"leave \r\n  [to amend pleadings] shall be freely given when justice so requires and does \r\n  not prejudice any other party.\" Rule 15(a), SCRCP; see also Crestwood \r\n  Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 218, 493 S.E.2d 826, 835 (1997). \r\n  \"The prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of notice that the new issue is going \r\n  to be tried, and a lack of opportunity to refute it.\" Pool v. Pool, 329 \r\n  S.C. 324, 328-9, 494 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1998) (citing Soil &amp; Material Eng'rs, \r\n  Inc. v. Folly Assocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987)). \r\n   \r\n\"It is well established that a motion \r\n  to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and that the \r\n  party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.\" Pruitt \r\n  v. Bowers, 330 S.C. 483, 489, 499 S.E.2d 250, 253 (Ct. App. 1998). Courts \r\n  have wide latitude in amending pleadings and \"[w]hile this power should not \r\n  be used indiscriminately or to prejudice or surprise another party, the decision \r\n  to allow an amendment is within the sound discretion of the trial court and \r\n  will rarely be disturbed on appeal.\" Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 450, \r\n  492 S.E.2d 794, 802 (Ct. App. 1997). \"The trial judge's finding will not be \r\n  overturned without an abuse of discretion or unless manifest injustice has occurred.\" \r\n  Id.  \r\n   \r\nThe circuit court granted Sirrine's \r\n  motion to amend but also granted Duncan an additional sixty days for discovery. \r\n  Duncan subsequently requested a second sixty day discovery extension thus providing \r\n  Duncan approximately four months to conduct discovery after Sirrine amended \r\n  its answer. When the four months expired and Duncan appeared before the circuit \r\n  court to contest Sirrine's motion for summary judgment, Duncan had only conducted \r\n  one deposition and failed to present any evidence establishing Sirrine designed \r\n  the hatch. The additional four month discovery period provided more than adequate \r\n  notice and opportunity to discover a sufficient amount of evidence to withstand \r\n  Sirrine's motion for summary judgment. See Soil &amp; Material Eng'rs, \r\n  Inc., 293 S.C. at 501, 361 S.E.2d at 781 (\"In considering potential prejudice \r\n  to the opposing party, the court should consider whether the opposing party \r\n  has had the opportunity to prepare for the issue now being raised formally.\" \r\n  (internal citation omitted)). Moreover, since Duncan produced no evidence that \r\n  Sirrine designed the hatch other than Sirrine's initial admission, requiring \r\n  Sirrine to be bound by its initial pleading would be grossly unfair.(2) \r\n  Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's decision permitting Sirrine to amend \r\n  its answer. \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n   \r\nDuncan next contends the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting Fluor Daniel summary judgment. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999); see also Standard Fire \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting and Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d \r\n  460, 462 (1990) (stating a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the \r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and \r\n  affidavits show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law). In ruling on a motion for \r\n  summary judgment, the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn from the \r\n  evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \r\n  Baird, 333 S.C. at 529, 511 S.E.2d at 74. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuncan asserts the OSHA and ANSI \r\n  standards implicated by his expert's testimony imposed a duty on Fluor Daniel \r\n  to ensure an open hatch was guarded and thus created a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact sufficient to overcome Fluor Daniel's motion for summary judgment. Duncan \r\n  also contends an implied warranty of workmanship burdened Fluor Daniel with \r\n  a duty to fulfill its construction obligations in accordance with OSHA standards.(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo the extent Duncan relies on an \r\n  implied warranty of workmanship theory, his contentions are not preserved for \r\n  appeal because Duncan failed to plead the issue, failed to raise the issue to \r\n  the circuit court, the circuit court failed to rule on the issue, and Duncan \r\n  failed to file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion. See Harris v. Bennett, \r\n  332 S.C. 238, 245, 503 S.E.2d 782, 786 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"As a general rule, \r\n  an issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been \r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the court below to be preserved for appellate review.\"); \r\n  Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding \r\n  an issue not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on a question \r\n  and the appellant fails to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend \r\n  the judgment on that ground). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhether OSHA's regulations imposed \r\n  a duty on Fluor Daniel under a negligence theory depends, in part, on whether \r\n  Fluor Daniel is subject to the OSHA regulations. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOSHA standards protect employees \r\n  working for any business qualifying as an employer under the Occupational Safety \r\n  and Health Act, 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 651 et seq. (1999). Employment Coordinator \r\n  Â§ WS-10,051 (Thomas Curry et al. eds. 1999); OSHA Reg., 29 C.F.R. Â§ 1910.2(c) \r\n  &amp;(d) (1994). The key factor in determining whether a party constitutes an \r\n  employer under OSHA regulations is whether the party has the right to control \r\n  an employee's work. Employment Coordinator Â§ WS-10,154 (citing Abbonizio \r\n  Contractors 16 BNA OSHC 2125 (1994)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuncan neither produced any evidence \r\n  nor ever asserted that Fluor Daniel had a right to control Duncan's work. Consequently, \r\n  Fluor Daniel failed to constitute Duncan's employer rendering the OSHA regulations \r\n  inapplicable. See Bunn v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 415 F. Supp. \r\n  286, 292 (W.D. Pa. 1976) (noting that OSHA safety codes have no binding effect \r\n  on a defendant who was not the plaintiff's employer), aff'd, 556 F.2d \r\n  564 (3rd Cir. 1977). Similarly, the ANSI standards themselves only \r\n  purport to be a guide and thus do not impose any extra duty on Fluor Daniel. \r\n  Furthermore, Duncan failed to cite any case, and our research revealed none, \r\n  using OSHA or ANSI standards to impose liability on a contractor when the contractor \r\n  merely assembled a project with design specifications provided by a third party.(4) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUpholding the circuit court's decision \r\n  granting Fluor Daniel summary judgment accords with the long accepted notion \r\n  that \"the contractor is not liable if he has merely carried out carefully the \r\n  plans, specifications and directions given him, since in that case the responsibility \r\n  is assumed by the employer, at least where the plans are not so obviously defective \r\n  and dangerous that no reasonable man would follow them.\" Keeton, supra, \r\n  Â§ 104A, at 723-4; see also 63A Am. Jur. 2d Products Liability \r\n  Â§ 1513, at 678-9 (1997) (\"[C]ontractor is not subject to liability if the specified \r\n  design is insufficient to make the product safe, unless it is so obviously bad \r\n  that a competent contractor would know that there was a good chance that the \r\n  product would be dangerously unsafe.\"); but see Collins v. Newman \r\n  Machine Co., 380 S.E.2d 314, 317 (Ga. Ct. App. 1989)(noting Georgia has \r\n  not recognized the product specifications defense). In the present case, Duncan's \r\n  own expert testified that stationing a person to guard the hatch, a solution \r\n  completely unrelated to construction, would ameliorate the potential hazard. \r\n  Therefore, the design specifications provided to Fluor Daniel were not so obviously \r\n  defective as to require Fluor Daniel to supplement the design on its own. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's \r\n  order granting Sirrine and Fluor Daniel summary judgment is \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, J.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  Fletcher also \r\n  relied on standards promulgated by the American National Standards Institute \r\n  (ANSI). \r\n2.  The hatch \r\n  was apparently designed by Hoechst, Duncan's employer. \r\n3.  Duncan's complaint \r\n  also alleged causes of action for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, \r\n  breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and strict \r\n  liability. These issues are not preserved for appeal because Duncan failed to \r\n  argue them in his brief. See Bell v. Bennett, 307 S.C. 286, \r\n  294, 414 S.E.2d 786, 791 (Ct. App. 1992) (noting an issue which is not argued \r\n  in the brief is deemed abandoned); Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no \r\n  point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues \r\n  on appeal.\"). \r\n   \r\nTo the extent preserved, Duncan's \r\n  claims under implied warranty theories are unavailing because a sale must occur \r\n  before an implied warranty can arise. See In re Breast \r\n  Implant Product Liability Litigation, 331 S.C. 540, 553, 503 S.E.2d 445, \r\n  452 (1998) (citing Priest v. Brown, 302 S.C. 405, 411, 396 S.E.2d 638, \r\n  641 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding a sale must occur before an implied warranty can \r\n  arise)). \r\n   \r\nDuncan's strict liability argument \r\n  also fails because Fluor Daniel's assembly work amounted to a service, rather \r\n  than a product, and South Carolina's strict liability statute does not apply \r\n  to services. See In re Breast Implant Product Liability \r\n  Litigation, 331 S.C. at 546-7, 503 S.E.2d at 448 (acknowledging South Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 \"imposes strict liability in tort upon the suppliers of \r\n  defective products\" but does not apply to services (quoting Samson v. Greenville \r\n  Hosp. Sys., 297 S.C. 409, 410, 377 S.E.2d 311, 311 (1989))); see also \r\n  W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts, Â§ 104A, at 724 (5th \r\n  ed. 1984) (\"The transaction of the building contractor has generally been regarded \r\n  as a transaction involving the rendition of a service even though the result \r\n  of the service is to supply a structure or building to the owner\" and therefore \r\n  strict liability is inappropriate); but see Worrell v. Barnes, \r\n  484 P.2d 573 (Nev. 1971) (imposing strict liability on a building contractor \r\n  under the theory that a structure is in essence a product sold within the meaning \r\n  of a sale), cited in Keeton, supra, Â§ 104A, at 724 &amp; n.38. \r\n  \r\n4.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nWhile being \"booked\" after a disorderly \r\n  conduct arrest, Higgenbottom pulled a spoon out of his pocket and told the officers \r\n  he \"might as well get one last piece of it.\" The officers seized the spoon, \r\n  which tested positive for cocaine residue. Higgenbottom claimed he found the \r\n  spoon while cleaning the parking lot at his tire store, placed it in his pocket \r\n  when \"a customer pulled up,\" and \"forgot [he] had it.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIs there a \"reasonable likelihood\" \r\n  the enhancement of Higgenbottom's sentence on motion to reconsider constituted \r\n  vindictiveness on the part of the trial judge? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHiggenbottom asserts the trial court \r\n  violated his due process rights when the court imposed a harsher sentence upon \r\n  reconsideration. He contends the \"extension of [his] sentence is unlawful because \r\n  it was imposed solely in retaliation for [his] exercise\" of his right to bring \r\n  post-trial motions. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHiggenbottom did not personally attend \r\n  his motion for sentence reconsideration. When Higgenbottom's counsel informed \r\n  the court of the nature of the motion, to request reduction of the probationary \r\n  sentence from eighteen to twelve months, the following exchange occurred: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court: Mr. Landry, Mr. Higgenbottom \r\n  is lucky. Maybe I ought to reconsider his sentence completely. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMr. Landry [defense counsel]: I discussed \r\n  that with him before I came. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court: It takes a lot of courage \r\n  for a lawyer to come back to ask for a reconsideration like that. Since this \r\n  term of court has not expired and since he is asking for a reconsideration maybe \r\n  I ought to just reconsider it on my own and extend his sentence . . . have his \r\n  [sic] picked up to do jail time. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMr. Landry: I understand that, Your \r\n  Honor. I discussed it with him before he asked for this.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court: He just about talked \r\n  himself into jail as it was. No, sir; I'm going to give him twenty-four \r\n  months probation. We're going to see if he can do probation. Maybe he'll be \r\n  cleaning up his lot again. Since you made the motion to reconsider, I'm \r\n  denying that motion and I'm reconsidering my sentence and extending his probation \r\n  to twenty-four months. (Emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, we note the State maintains \r\n  Higgenbottom failed to preserve this issue for appeal because he did not argue \r\n  to the trial court that the court had improperly extended his probationary sentence. \r\n  To preserve a challenge to sentencing, an appellant must raise the issue to \r\n  the trial court. State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 510 S.E.2d 423 (1999). \r\n  Higgenbottom objected to his original sentence and received a higher sentence \r\n  on resentencing. If Higgenbottom objected to his sentence in this resentencing \r\n  scenario, surely he would place himself in a perilous posture. The \"rule of \r\n  futility\" should save Higgenbottom from the clutches of Johnston. In \r\n  State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 447 S.E.2d 186 (1994), the Supreme Court \r\n  enunciated a \"rule of futility\" in certain trial scenarios. Pace edifies: \r\n  \"As to counsel's failure to raise an objection, the tone and tenor of the trial \r\n  judge's remarks concerning her gender and conduct were such that any objection \r\n  would have been futile.\" Id. at 74, 447 S.E.2d at 187. State v. \r\n  McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 462 S.E.2d 882 (Ct. App. 1995), amplifies the dilemma \r\n  of a defense attorney: \"So long as the judge had an opportunity to rule on an \r\n  issue, and did so, it was 'not incumbent upon defense counsel to harass the \r\n  judge by parading the issue before him again.'\" Id. at 37, 462 S.E.2d \r\n  at 884. Apodictically, the tone and tenor of the judge revealed the futility \r\n  of an objection. \r\n   \r\nIn the seminal case of North \r\n  Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), \r\n  the United States Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the imposition \r\n  of a harsher sentence on retrial after a criminal defendant successfully attacks \r\n  an initial conviction on appeal. The Court opined: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold . . . that neither the double \r\n  jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposes an absolute bar to \r\n  a more severe sentence upon reconviction. A trial judge is not constitutionally \r\n  precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or \r\n  less than the original sentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first \r\n  trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant's \"life, health, habits, \r\n  conduct, and mental and moral propensities.\" Such information may come to the \r\n  judge's attention from evidence adduced at the second trial itself, from a new \r\n  presentence investigation, from the defendant's prison record, or possibly from \r\n  other sources. The freedom of a sentencing judge to consider the defendant's \r\n  conduct subsequent to the first conviction in imposing a new sentence is no \r\n  more than consonant with the principle, fully approved in Williams v. New \r\n  York, [337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)], that a State \r\n  may adopt the \"prevalent modern philosophy of penology that the punishment should \r\n  fit the offender and not merely the crime.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo say that there exists no absolute \r\n  constitutional bar to the imposition of a more severe sentence upon retrial \r\n  is not, however, to end the inquiry. There remains for consideration the impact \r\n  of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n \r\nIt can hardly be doubted that it \r\n  would be a flagrant violation of the Fourteenth Amendment for a state trial \r\n  court to follow an announced practice of imposing a heavier sentence upon every \r\n  reconvicted defendant for the explicit purpose of punishing the defendant for \r\n  his having succeeded in getting his original conviction set aside. Where, as \r\n  in each of the cases before us, the original conviction has been set aside because \r\n  of a constitutional error, the imposition of such a punishment, \"penalizing \r\n  those who choose to exercise\" constitutional rights, \"would be patently unconstitutional.\" \r\n  And the very threat inherent in the existence of such a punitive policy would, \r\n  with respect to those still in prison, serve to \"chill the exercise of basic \r\n  constitutional rights.\" But even if the first conviction has been set aside \r\n  for nonconstitutional error, the imposition of a penalty upon the defendant \r\n  for having successfully pursued a statutory right of appeal or collateral remedy \r\n  would be no less a violation of due process of law. \"A new sentence, with enhanced \r\n  punishment, based upon such a reason, would be a flagrant violation of the rights \r\n  of the defendant.\" A court is \"without right to . . . put a price on an appeal. \r\n  A defendant's exercise of a right of appeal must be free and unfettered. . . \r\n  . [I]t is unfair to use the great power given to the court to determine sentence \r\n  to place a defendant in the dilemma of making an unfree choice.\" \"This Court \r\n  has never held that the States are required to establish avenues of appellate \r\n  review, but it is now fundamental that, once established, these avenues must \r\n  be kept free of unreasoned distinctions that can only impede open and equal \r\n  access to the courts.[\"] \r\n   \r\nDue process of law, then, requires \r\n  that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his \r\n  first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. \r\n  And since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant's \r\n  exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, \r\n  due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such \r\n  a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPearce, 395 U.S. at 723-24, \r\n  89 S.Ct. at 2079-80, 23 L.Ed.2d at 668-69 (citations and footnote omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Pearce Court fashioned \r\n  a presumption that a trial court's imposition of a harsher sentence upon resentencing \r\n  results from vindictiveness and offered prophylactic measures a trial court \r\n  could use to protect itself from reversal in instances in which it imposed a \r\n  harsher, albeit nonvindictive, sentence upon reconviction: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn order to assure the absence of \r\n  such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe \r\n  sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must \r\n  affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information \r\n  concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after \r\n  the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which \r\n  the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the \r\n  constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on \r\n  appeal.  \r\nPearce, 395 U.S. at 726, \r\n  89 S.Ct. at 2081, 23 L.Ed.2d at 670. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Pearce presumption has \r\n  been emasculated by subsequent cases. In Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. \r\n  21, 27, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2102-03, 40 L.Ed.2d 628, 634 (1974), the Court explained \r\n  Pearce and its progeny made clear \"that the Due Process Clause is not \r\n  offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, \r\n  but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness.'\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court, in United States v. \r\n  Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 369-70, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2487, 73 L.Ed.2d 74, 78 \r\n  (1982), addressed the question of whether the Pearce presumption \"that \r\n  has been used to evaluate a judicial or prosecutorial response to a criminal \r\n  defendant's exercise of a right to be retried after he has been convicted should \r\n  also be applied to evaluate a prosecutor's pretrial response to a defendant's \r\n  demand for a jury trial.\" In Goodwin, the appellant claimed the prosecutor \r\n  indicted him on additional charges when he refused to plead guilty and demanded \r\n  a jury trial. The Court noted that, because no evidence in the case would support \r\n  a claim of actual vindictiveness, reversal was only available if a presumption \r\n  of vindictiveness applied. In declining to apply a presumption of vindictiveness \r\n  under the given facts, the Court reasoned the \"possibility that a prosecutor \r\n  would respond to a defendant's pretrial demand for a jury trial by bringing \r\n  charges not in the public interest that could be explained only as penalty imposed \r\n  on the defendant is so unlikely that a presumption of vindictiveness \r\n  certainly is not warranted. Id. at 384, 102 S.Ct. at 2494, 73 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 87 (emphasis in original). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRevisiting the Pearce presumption \r\n  in Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559, 104 S.Ct. 3217, 82 L.Ed.2d \r\n  424 (1984), the Court applied the presumption in a case where the appellant \r\n  received a harsher sentence upon reconviction following a successful appeal. \r\n  The Court found the trial judge \"carefully explained his reasons for imposing \r\n  the greater sentence.\" Id. at 569, 104 S.Ct. at 3223, 82 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  433. The Court acknowledged that \"[i]n only one other circumstance has this \r\n  Court identified a need to indulge a presumption of vindictiveness of the kind \r\n  imposed in Pearce.\" Id. at 565, 104 S.Ct. at 3221, 82 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 431. Further, the Court clarified that \"where the presumption applies, the \r\n  sentencing authority or the prosecutor must rebut the presumption that an increased \r\n  sentence or charge resulted from vindictiveness; where the presumption does \r\n  not apply, the defendant must affirmatively prove actual vindictiveness.\" Id. \r\n  at 569, 104 S.Ct. at 3223, 82 L.Ed.2d at 433. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Texas v. McCullough, \r\n  475 U.S. 134, 106 S.Ct. 976, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986), the appellant was convicted \r\n  of murder in a jury trial and elected, in accordance with his rights under Texas \r\n  law, to have the jury impose his sentence. He moved for a new trial based on \r\n  prosecutorial misconduct. The judge granted the motion. The appellant received \r\n  a new trial before the same judge and a different jury. Again he was convicted \r\n  of murder, but elected to have the trial judge sentence him. Whereas the jury \r\n  in the first trial sentenced the appellant to twenty years, the judge imposed \r\n  a fifty year sentence at the conclusion of the second trial. The Court held \r\n  the Pearce presumption did not apply. The Court's reasoning is particularly \r\n  enlightening to the facts of the present case: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn contrast to Pearce, McCullough's \r\n  second trial came about because the trial judge herself concluded that the prosecutor's \r\n  misconduct required it. Granting McCullough's motion for a new trial hardly \r\n  suggests any vindictiveness on the part of the judge towards him. \"[U]nlike \r\n  the judge who has been reversed,\" the trial judge here had \"no motivation to \r\n  engage in self-vindication.\" In such circumstances, there is also no justifiable \r\n  concern about \"institutional interests that might occasion higher sentences \r\n  by a judge desirous of discouraging what he regards as meritless appeals.\" In \r\n  granting McCullough's new trial motion, [the judge] went on record as agreeing \r\n  that his \"claims\" had merit. Presuming vindictiveness on this basis alone would \r\n  be tantamount to presuming that a judge will be vindictive towards a defendant \r\n  merely because he seeks an acquittal. Thus, in support of its position, the \r\n  dissent conjures up visions of judges who view defendants as temerarious for \r\n  filing motions for new trials, and who are \"annoyed\" at being forced \"to sit \r\n  through . . . trial[s] whose result[s] [are] foregone conclusion[s].\" We decline \r\n  to adopt the view that the judicial temperament of our Nation's trial judges \r\n  will suddenly change upon the filing of a successful post-trial motion. The \r\n  presumption of Pearce does not apply in situations where the possibility \r\n  of vindictiveness is this speculative, particularly since the presumption may \r\n  often \"operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . \r\n  . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct.\" Indeed, not even \"apprehension \r\n  of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge\" could \r\n  be present in this case. McCullough was entitled by law to choose to be sentenced \r\n  by either a judge or a jury. Faced with that choice, on retrial McCullough chose \r\n  to be sentenced by [the judge]. There can hardly be more emphatic affirmation \r\n  of his appraisal of [the judge's] fairness than this choice. Because there was \r\n  no realistic motive for vindictive sentencing, the Pearce presumption \r\n  was inappropriate. \r\n   \r\nThe presumption is also inapplicable \r\n  because different sentencers assessed the varying sentences that McCullough \r\n  received. In such circumstances, a sentence \"increase\" cannot truly be said \r\n  to have taken place.  \r\n   \r\nMcCullough, 475 U.S. at \r\n  138-40, 106 S.Ct. at 979, 89 L.Ed.2d at 111-12 (emphasis added)(citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court, in Alabama v. Smith, \r\n  490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989), entertained an appeal \r\n  from an appellant who received a harsher sentence at trial than was imposed \r\n  after a prior guilty plea, which he successfully attacked. The same judge who \r\n  presided over appellant's trial had accepted his earlier guilty plea. In finding \r\n  the presumption of vindictiveness did not apply, the Court overruled Pearce's \r\n  companion case, Simpson v. Rice, which was procedurally identical to \r\n  Smith's. The Court concluded \"there is no basis for a presumption of vindictiveness \r\n  where a second sentence imposed after a trial is heavier than a first sentence \r\n  imposed after a guilty plea.\" Id. at 803, 109 S.Ct. at 2207, 104 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 875. Discussing the erosion of the presumption of vindictiveness, the Court \r\n  stated: \r\n   \r\nWhile the Pearce opinion \r\n  appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent \r\n  cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness \"do[es] not apply \r\n  in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.\" \r\n  As we explained in Texas v. McCullough, \"the evil the [Pearce] \r\n  Court sought to prevent\" was not the imposition of \"enlarged sentences after \r\n  a new trial\" but \"vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.\" Because the Pearce \r\n  presumption \"may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and \r\n  thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct,\" we have limited \r\n  its application, like that of \"other 'judicially created means of effectuating \r\n  the rights secured by the [Constitution],'\" to circumstances \"where its \r\n  'objectives are thought most efficaciously served[.]'\" Such circumstances are \r\n  those in which there is a \"reasonable likelihood,\" that the increase in sentence \r\n  is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority. \r\n  Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the burden remains upon the defendant \r\n  to prove actual vindictiveness. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSmith, 490 U.S. at 799, \r\n  109 S.Ct. at 2204-05, 104 L.Ed.2d at 872-73 (emphasis added)(citations omitted). \r\n   \r\nThe modification of the once strong \r\n  presumption of vindictiveness established by Pearce is reflected in \r\n  the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions. For example, in Colorado \r\n  v. Williams, 916 P.2d 624 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996), after successfully appealing \r\n  his conviction for second degree murder, the appellant received a new trial, \r\n  in which he was additionally tried on five counts charging him with being an \r\n  habitual criminal. Appellant argued a defendant's sentence following reconviction \r\n  on remand could only be increased if \"'based upon objective information concerning \r\n  identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of \r\n  the original sentencing proceeding.' \" Id. at 626 (quoting Pearce, \r\n  395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081, 23 L.Ed.2d at 670). The Colorado appellate \r\n  court noted that Texas v. McCullough, 475 U.S. 134, 106 S.Ct. 976, \r\n  89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986), declared a defendant who had successfully appealed a \r\n  conviction might properly receive a longer sentence upon reconviction if it \r\n  was learned he had a long criminal history which was undiscovered until after \r\n  the first conviction because of his use of an alias. The Colorado court further \r\n  stated a harsher sentence upon a second conviction was proper where the information \r\n  of appellant's prior convictions was available, but unknown to the sentencing \r\n  court or solicitor at the first trial. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn United States v. Mabry, \r\n  953 F.2d 127 (4th Cir. 1992), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  considered an appellant's claim of vindictiveness by the government in her sentencing. \r\n  Appellant's challenge to the findings of a pre-sentencing report triggered a \r\n  mandatory sentencing hearing. During the hearing, a witness testified to bad \r\n  acts by the appellant which had not been revealed when this same witness testified \r\n  during the guilt phase. The appellant claimed the introduction of this testimony \r\n  \"constituted a vindictive attempt to chill her initiative to raise the claim, \r\n  as well as the future attempts of others similarly situated to raise such claims.\" \r\n  Id. at 132. The court concluded the appellant's reliance upon the Pearce \r\n  presumption was misplaced, finding Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, \r\n  109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989), \"severely limited the Pearce \r\n  opinion, and asserted that when there is no 'reasonable likelihood' that an \r\n  increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness, 'the burden remains \r\n  upon the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness.'\" Id. at 133. In \r\n  United States v. Kincaid, 964 F.2d 325 (4th Cir. 1992), \r\n  the Fourth Circuit noted the Pearce rule had been limited by Smith. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Pearce rule has been \r\n  perceived as so restricted by subsequent cases that some courts cite it as having \r\n  been overruled by Smith. See State v. Oliver, 470 \r\n  S.E.2d 16 (N.C. 1996); Gorham v. Commonwealth, 426 S.E.2d 493 (Va. \r\n  Ct. App. 1993); State v. Gill, 416 S.E.2d 253 (W. Va. 1992). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe appellate courts in South Carolina \r\n  have addressed the presumption of vindictiveness on more than one occasion. \r\n  In State v. Hilton, 291 S.C. 276, 353 S.E.2d 282 (1987), our Supreme \r\n  Court, citing Pearce, noted \"vindictiveness against a defendant for \r\n  seeking appellate review and obtaining a new trial must not be a factor in the \r\n  sentence the defendant receives after retrial.\" Id. at 277-78, 353 \r\n  S.E.2d at 283. Following the reasoning of McCullough, supra, \r\n  the Hilton Court held the Pearce presumption did not apply \r\n  because the appellant's sentence after his new trial was imposed by a different \r\n  judge than the one at his original trial. Without the presumption, the Court \r\n  stated the appellant had to prove actual vindictiveness to prevail. The court \r\n  found no evidence of actual vindictiveness and affirmed the appealed sentence. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn State v. Fletcher, 322 \r\n  S.C. 256, 471 S.E.2d 702 (Ct. App. 1996), written after the decision in Alabama \r\n  v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989), this Court \r\n  explained the current state of the law regarding vindictiveness in resentencing: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is a due process violation to \r\n  punish a person for exercising a protected statutory or constitutional right. \r\n  In a criminal prosecution, however, punishment of the offender is recognized \r\n  as a proper motivation for a sentencing trial judge or a prosecutor. As stated \r\n  in [United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 372-73, 102 S.Ct. 2485, \r\n  2488-89, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982)], \"[t]he presence of a punitive motivation, therefore, \r\n  does not provide an adequate basis for distinguishing governmental action that \r\n  is fully justified as a legitimate response to perceived criminal conduct from \r\n  governmental action that is an impermissible response to noncriminal, protected \r\n  activity.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe presumption of vindictiveness \r\n  is premised on the need to guard against actual vindictiveness in the resentencing \r\n  process. The inquiry, however, is not focused solely on the presence or absence \r\n  of actual vindictive motive, but includes whether the action taken, which exposes \r\n  the accused to an increased punishment, poses such a \"reasonable likelihood \r\n  of vindictiveness\" as to require a presumption of vindictiveness. The presumption \r\n  is applied only where there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that an unexplained \r\n  increase in a defendant's sentence is due to the actual vindictiveness of the \r\n  sentencing authority. Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the burden \r\n  is on the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFletcher, 322 S.C. at 260-61, \r\n  471 S.E.2d at 704-05 (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe dissent cites State v. Hidalgo, \r\n  684 So. 2d 26 (La. Ct. App. 1996), in support of the conclusion that the sentence \r\n  in the present case was vindictive. Hidalgo is factually inapposite \r\n  to the case at bar. The trial court in Hidalgo specifically nexed the \r\n  resentencing activity to the exercise of constitutional rights: \"Instead of \r\n  taking his medicine, admitting his guilt, and accepting his sentence, he \r\n  chose instead to attack his plea when he knew it was free and voluntary.\" \r\n  Id. at 31 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeal of Louisiana opined \r\n  \"the court not only failed to provide adequate justification on the record for \r\n  its decision to increase the defendant's sentence but also apparently increased \r\n  his sentence because he chose to exercise his right to attack his guilty plea.\" \r\n  Id. (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge in the instant case, \r\n  unlike a trial judge who had been reversed, had no motive to vindicate himself \r\n  by imposing a harsher sentence. See Texas v. McCullough, 475 \r\n  U.S. 134, 106 S.Ct. 976, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986). Because there is no reasonable \r\n  likelihood of vindictiveness in a case such as this, where a trial court is \r\n  reconsidering a defendant's sentence upon the defendant's request, the Pearce \r\n  presumption does not apply. Thus, in order to prevail, Higgenbottom must prove \r\n  actual vindictiveness. \r\n   \r\nDespite the State's claim that if \r\n  the case had gone to trial several police officers could testify Higgenbottom \r\n  made the spontaneous self-incriminating statement that he \"might as well get \r\n  one last piece of it\" as he put the spoon with cocaine traces on it into his \r\n  mouth, Higgenbottom claimed the spoon was not his and pled guilty under Alford. \r\n  Before the court initially sentenced Higgenbottom, defense counsel informed \r\n  the court of Higgenbottom's medical disabilities and asked the court, \"in its \r\n  discretion, to give him a small fine, place him on probation for one year and \r\n  give him a small amount of community service.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find Higgenbottom did not meet \r\n  his burden of proving \"actual vindictiveness.\" The court's decision to extend \r\n  Higgenbottom's probationary sentence was based on a review of the facts of the \r\n  case. The court did not believe Higgenbottom's explanation of how a cocaine-laced \r\n  spoon made its way into his pocket, considering his actions and statement at \r\n  the police department. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold the Pearce rule \r\n  of \"presumption of vindictiveness\" is applied only where there \r\n  is a \"reasonable likelihood\" the increase in sentence is the product \r\n  of \"actual vindictiveness\" on the part of the sentencing authority. Where \r\n  there is no such \"reasonable likelihood,\" the burden is on the defendant to \r\n  prove \"actual vindictiveness.\" In the case sub judice, Higgenbottom \r\n  failed to prove \"actual vindictiveness.\" The fact-based reconsideration does \r\n  not rise to the level of \"actual vindictiveness\" on the part of the sentencing \r\n  judge. The sentence was properly extended. Accordingly, Higgenbottom's sentence \r\n  and conviction are \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n1. \r\nNorth Carolina v. Alford, \r\n400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs in result only \r\n  in a separate opinion. CONNOR, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n \r\nGOOLSBY, J. (concurring): \r\n  I, too, would affirm, but for a different reason. The appellant Jeffery Higgenbottom \r\n  never argued to the trial court the question he argues here, i.e., that \r\n  his due process rights were violated because the trial court extended his sentence \r\n  \"solely in retaliation for [Higgenbottom's] exercise of his statutory right \r\n  to bring post-trial motions.\" Unless an issue is raised to and ruled on by the \r\n  trial court, the Court of Appeals cannot address it.(1c) \r\n  At no point below did Higgenbottom question the trial court's action on any \r\n  basis whatsoever or attempt to do so. Indeed, his counsel seemed to concede \r\n  the court had the power to do what it did. Viz.: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I have one \r\n  brief matter; It's a motion to reconsider on Jeffery Higgenbottom. . . . As \r\n  the court recalls, yesterday you sentenced Mr. Higgenbottom to . . . two years \r\n  in the Department of Corrections, $5,000, suspended upon thirty days or $750 \r\n  with eighteen months probation and thirty days public service employment. At \r\n  his request I am waiving his presence and asking for the court to . . . reconsider \r\n  the probationary sentence specifically and reduce that to twelve months.\r\nCOURT: [Counsel], Mr. Higgenbottom \r\n  is lucky. Maybe I ought to reconsider his sentence completely.\r\n[COUNSEL]: I discussed that with \r\n  him before I came.\r\nCOURT: It takes a lot of courage \r\n  for a lawyer to come back to ask for a reconsideration like that. Since this \r\n  term of court has not expired and since he is asking for a reconsideration maybe \r\n  I ought to just reconsider it on my own and extend his sentence . . . have hi[m] \r\n  picked up to do jail time.\r\n[COUNSEL]: I understand that, your \r\n  Honor. I discussed it with him before he asked for this.\r\nTHE COURT: He just about talked himself \r\n  into jail as it was. No, sir; I'm going to give him twenty-four months probation. \r\n  We're going to see if he can do probation. Maybe he'll be cleaning up his lot \r\n  again. Since you made the motion to reconsider, \r\nI'm denying that motion and I'm reconsidering \r\n  my sentence and extending his probation to twenty-four months. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCertainly, if counsel felt the trial \r\n  court lacked authority to do what it did, either because of statute or because \r\n  of some constitutional prohibition, then was the time to say so.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMoreover, nothing that I read in \r\n  the record of the proceedings held on Higgenbottom's motion, and nothing about \r\n  the tone and tenor of the trial court's remarks during those proceedings, suggest \r\n  it would have been futile for counsel to have raised the issue now argued to \r\n  us. \r\n1c.  See \r\n  State v. Hudgins, 319 S.C. 233, 460 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (a defendant's \r\n  claim that the imposition of the death penalty on a seventeen-year old constituted \r\n  cruel and unusual punishment held procedurally barred where the defendant did \r\n  not raise the issue in the trial court); State v. Owen, 275 S.C. 586, \r\n  274 S.E.2d 510 (1981) (the appellants' contention that their respective sentences \r\n  constituted cruel and unusual punishment held procedurally barred because it \r\n  was not first presented to the trial court); cf. State v. McKinney, \r\n  278 S.C. 107, 292 S.E.2d 598 (1982) (absent a timely objection during the guilty \r\n  plea proceeding, the unknowing or involuntary nature of a guilty plea cannot \r\n  be raised on direct appeal, but must be addressed through the more appropriate \r\n  channel of post-conviction relief). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.: (Dissenting) \r\n  I respectfully dissent. Where the same judge who accepted the plea increases \r\n  the sentence the day after the plea, I believe precedent requires a finding \r\n  that there is a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness.(1d) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs stated in the lead opinion, Smith \r\n  limited the Pearce presumption of vindictiveness to circumstances \"in \r\n  which there is a 'reasonable likelihood' that the increase in sentence is the \r\n  product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.\" Alabama \r\n  v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 800 (1989) (overruling Simpson v. Rice, 395 \r\n  U.S. 711 (1969) (companion case to North Carolina v. Pearce)) (citation \r\n  omitted). The Court determined whether a \"reasonable likelihood\" of vindictiveness \r\n  existed by asking if the increase in sentence was \"more likely than not\" attributable \r\n  to the vindictiveness of the sentencing judge. Id. at 801-02. Here the \r\n  defendant moved for reconsideration of sentencing before the same judge. The \r\n  defendant did not appear at the hearing, and the judge had no new information \r\n  presented to him. The judge increased the sentence without explanation. Under \r\n  these facts, prior case law requires a finding that the sentence increase was \r\n  \"more likely than not\" attributable to vindictiveness. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Smith, the Court concluded \r\n  a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness did not exist when a defendant attacked \r\n  his guilty plea and receives a harsher sentence after retrial by the same judge \r\n  who accepted the original guilty plea. Id. at 801. It is particularly \r\n  important, in light of the lead opinion, to explain the factors that led the \r\n  Supreme Court to its decision in Smith. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decision in Smith focused \r\n  on the sentencing judge's access to a \"greater amount of sentencing information \r\n  that a trial generally affords as compared to a guilty plea.\" Id. at \r\n  803. The Court explained that \"in the course of the proof at trial the judge \r\n  may gather a fuller appreciation of the nature and extent of the crimes charged.\" \r\n  Id. at 801. Furthermore, \"[t]he defendant's conduct during trial may \r\n  give the judge insights into his moral character and suitability for rehabilitation.\" \r\n  Id. This additional information is generally not before the judge when \r\n  sentencing after a guilty plea. It is only available for the judge's consideration \r\n  after trial. Because the judge in Smith could have based the increased \r\n  sentence on the information available to him during trial, the Supreme Court \r\n  held there was no reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness and the presumption \r\n  of Pearce should not apply.\r\n \r\nIn the case at bar, the judge sentenced \r\n  Higgenbottom after an Alford guilty plea. See North Carolina \r\n  v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). The next day Higgenbottom's attorney made \r\n  a motion for reconsideration of the sentence. The following exchange occurred: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I have one \r\n  brief matter; It's a motion to reconsider on Jeffrey Higgenbottom . . . . At \r\n  his request I am waiving his presence and asking for the Court . . . to reconsider \r\n  the probationary sentence specifically and reduce that to twelve months. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCOURT: [Counsel], Mr. Higgenbottom \r\n  is lucky. Maybe I ought to reconsider his sentence completely. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[COUNSEL]: I discussed that with \r\n  him before I came. \r\n   \r\nCOURT: It takes a lot of courage \r\n  for a lawyer to come back to ask for a reconsideration like that. Since \r\n  this term of court has not expired and since he is asking for a reconsideration \r\n  maybe I ought to just reconsider it on my own and extend his sentence . . . \r\n  have his [sic] picked up to do jail time. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[COUNSEL]: I understand that, Your \r\n  Honor. I discussed it with him before he asked for this. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCOURT: He just about talked himself \r\n  into jail as it was. No, sir; I'm going to give him twenty-four months probation. \r\n  We're going to see if he can do probation. Maybe he'll be cleaning up his lot \r\n  again. Since you made the motion to reconsider, I'm denying that motion \r\n  and I'm reconsidering my sentence and extending his probation to twenty-four \r\n  months. (Emphasis added). \r\n   \r\nNone of the things the Court considered \r\n  in Smith in determining there was no reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness \r\n  were present here. The sentencing judge did not \"gather a fuller appreciation \r\n  of the nature and extent of the crimes charged\" through any evidence that was \r\n  not before him the previous day because no new evidence was presented at the \r\n  motion hearing. Smith, 490 U.S. at 801. Nor could the defendant's conduct \r\n  at the motion hearing have given the judge \"insights into his moral character \r\n  and suitability for rehabilitation\" because he did not appear at the motion \r\n  hearing. Id. One day after the original sentencing, the only thing that \r\n  was different about Higgenbottom's case was his motion to reconsider.\r\n \r\nIn Smith, the Supreme Court \r\n  specifically distinguished its holding from cases in which the same sentencing \r\n  judge presides over both the initial trial and the second trial. The Court held, \r\n  \"There, the sentencing judge who presides at both trials can be expected to \r\n  operate in the context of roughly the same sentencing considerations after the \r\n  second trial as he does after the first; any unexplained change in the sentence \r\n  is therefore subject to a presumption of vindictiveness.\" Id. at \r\n  802 (emphasis added). In those cases the Court found the Pearce presumption \r\n  would apply. Where, as here, no new evidence is before the court on a motion \r\n  for reconsideration, the sentencing judge should be similarly constrained. The \r\n  unexplained increase in the sentence makes the facts of this case likewise subject \r\n  to the presumption of vindictiveness. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe lead opinion states the sentencing \r\n  judge increased the sentence after reconsidering Higgenbottom's account of how \r\n  the cocaine-laced spoon got into his pocket. However, that same information \r\n  was before the judge when the original sentence was imposed. To avoid the presumption \r\n  of vindictiveness new evidence must be presented to the sentencing judge. See \r\n  Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559, 572 (1984) (\"[A] sentencing authority \r\n  may justify an increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant conduct \r\n  or events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings.\"); \r\n  see also United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 374 (1982) \r\n  (The presumption of vindictiveness \"may be overcome only by objective information \r\n  in the record justifying the increased sentence.\"). Allowing an increased sentence \r\n  based on a reconsideration of the same evidence would effectively eliminate \r\n  the protection the United States Supreme Court attempted to provide in Pearce. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nEach of the cases the majority cites \r\n  where the presumption of vindictiveness did not apply involve procedural and \r\n  factual distinctions from the instant case. In those cases, either the second \r\n  sentencer was different or additional facts were presented.(2d) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Texas v. McCullough, 475 \r\n  U.S. 134 (1986), the defendant was convicted and sentenced to twenty years by \r\n  a jury. The trial judge granted the defendant's motion for a new trial, and \r\n  the defendant elected to be sentenced by the judge after the second trial. The \r\n  trial judge sentenced the defendant to fifty years. The United States Supreme \r\n  Court held there was no reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness because: (1) \r\n  the trial judge granted the new trial; (2) the jury and the judge were different \r\n  sentencers; and (3) new evidence was presented at the second trial. Id. \r\n  at 138-43. \r\n   \r\nIn Colorado v. Williams, 916 \r\n  P.2d 624 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996), after the defendant successfully appealed his \r\n  conviction, the trial court allowed the district attorney to add five new counts \r\n  charging the defendant as an habitual criminal. The jury found the defendant \r\n  guilty of all charges, and he received an increased sentence. The Court of Appeals \r\n  of Colorado held the presumption of vindictiveness did not apply when new evidence \r\n  of the defendant's criminal record under an alias was presented to the court \r\n  at the second trial. Id. at 626-27.\r\nIn State v. Hilton, 291 S.C. \r\n  276, 353 S.E.2d 282 (1987), the defendant was convicted of assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill and sentenced to fifteen years. The Court of Appeals reversed. \r\n  On retrial, a different trial judge sentenced the defendant to twenty years \r\n  for the same offense. The South Carolina Supreme Court followed Texas v. \r\n  McCullough, 475 U.S. 134 (1986), and held \"the Pearce presumption \r\n  is inapplicable when the second sentencing judge is someone other than the original \r\n  judge.\" Hilton, 291 S.C. at 279, 353 S.E.2d at 284. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA recent Louisiana decision is factually \r\n  similar to this case. In Louisiana v. Hidalgo, 684 So.2d 26 (La. Ct. \r\n  App. 1996), the defendant was sentenced by the judge after entering a guilty \r\n  plea. He thereafter filed a motion to withdraw or set aside the guilty plea \r\n  and a motion to reconsider his sentence. The judge denied the motion to withdraw \r\n  the guilty plea, but increased the sentence with no new evidence. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court of Appeal of Louisiana \r\n  discussed the due process requirement that a sentencing judge provide justification \r\n  in the record for an increased sentence. It held \"the increased sentence failed \r\n  to satisfy the dictates of due process as set forth in Pearce.\" Id. \r\n  The court also stated, \"[T]he court not only failed to provide adequate justification \r\n  on the record for its decision to increase the defendant's sentence [as required \r\n  by Pearce] but also apparently increased his sentence because he chose \r\n  to exercise his right to attack his guilty plea.\" Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe lead opinion distinguishes Hidalgo \r\n  by claiming that the Court of Appeal of Louisiana \"specifically nexed the resentencing \r\n  activity to the exercise of constitutional rights.\" However, when a judge increases \r\n  a sentence in contravention of Pearce, that alone violates the constitutional \r\n  right that Pearce was intended to protect, specifically the right to \r\n  due process. The Court of Appeal of Louisiana held the sentencing judge violated \r\n  Pearce by increasing the sentence after the defendant's motion for reconsideration \r\n  without providing adequate justification on the record. I believe Hidalgo \r\n  is exactly like the case at hand. As in the instant case, the increased sentence \r\n  followed the defendant's motion to reconsider and the same judge did not consider \r\n  any new evidence. \r\n   \r\nAccording to precedent, the presumption \r\n  of vindictiveness applies under the facts of this case. Because the sentencing \r\n  judge failed to put adequate justification for the increase on the record to \r\n  rebut that presumption, I would vacate the increased sentence and reinstate \r\n  the original sentence. \r\n   \r\n1d.  Although \r\n  the words \"vindictive\" and \"vindictiveness\" are used in Pearce and its \r\n  progeny to describe the improper motivation for increased sentences, the words \r\n  \"retaliation\" and \"retaliatory\" are also used and in the case at bar are more \r\n  accurate. See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725 (1969) \r\n  (stating \"due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension \r\n  of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge\"); United \r\n  States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 372 (1982) (\"Because the court believed \r\n  that the circumstances surrounding the felony indictment gave rise to a genuine \r\n  risk of retaliation, it adopted a legal presumption . . . .\"); Bordenkircher \r\n  v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 363 (1978) (\"The Court has emphasized that the due \r\n  process violation in cases such as Pearce and Perry lay not \r\n  in the possibility that a defendant might be deterred from the exercise of a \r\n  legal right, but rather in the danger that the State might be retaliating against \r\n  the accused for lawfully attacking his conviction.\" (citations omitted)); Blackledge \r\n  v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 28 (1974) (\"A person convicted of an offense is entitled \r\n  to pursue his statutory right to a trial de novo, without apprehension \r\n  that the State will retaliate . . . .\"). \r\n2d.  The lead \r\n  opinion also cites: United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368 (1982); United \r\n  States v. Mabry, 953 F.2d 127 (4th Cir. 1991); and State v. \r\n  Fletcher, 322 S.C. 256, 471 S.E.2d 702 (Ct. App. 1996). However, the foregoing \r\n  cases involve prosecutorial vindictiveness rather than vindictiveness in sentencing \r\n  and are only relevant insofar as they generally discuss the Pearce presumption. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3073","title":"Canal Insurance Co. v.

Erika E. Hennington \r\n  and Donna W. Parker appeal. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nAt \r\n  11:25 a.m. on July 14, 1994, a dump truck owned by Caldwell Trucking was involved \r\n  in a multi-vehicle accident on Interstate 20 in Columbia. A second Caldwell \r\n  truck, following at some distance behind the first, subsequently radioed in \r\n  to the home office that \"it was one of our trucks involved.\" Shortly thereafter, \r\n  Hercules Caldwell, the owner of Caldwell Trucking, sent Ann Jackson, an employee, \r\n  to the Shelton Brown Agency to renew the company's lapsed insurance policy. \r\n  (1) Caldwell specifically instructed Jackson to inquire if the policy \r\n  could be made retroactive to the time the insurance agency had opened that morning. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAt \r\n  the Shelton Brown office, Jackson completed an application for insurance and \r\n  inquired when the coverage would begin. Feeling \"a little uncomfortable\" with \r\n  this question, Lisa Meetze, an agency employee, relayed the information to Jimmy \r\n  Brown, the agency owner. Brown called Kay Culberson at Canal Insurance Company \r\n  (Canal), his trucking insurance underwriter, and asked if Caldwell's renewal \r\n  premium was still valid. Culberson replied that it was and offered to \"bind\" \r\n  the policy into immediate effect. Brown agreed and the policy was bound at 12:45 \r\n  p.m. Meetze later receipted the down payment on the policy premium at 12:53 \r\n  p.m.  \r\n   \r\nLater \r\n  that afternoon, Hercules Caldwell phoned Brown and told him there had been an \r\n  accident involving one of his company trucks. Caldwell asked Brown if the accident \r\n  was covered, and Brown replied that it would be if it occurred after the policy \r\n  was bound. Caldwell indicated he did not know the time of the accident, but \r\n  stated he would send Brown a copy of the accident report when he received it. \r\n  Caldwell subsequently sent Brown a copy of the F.R.10 accident report on July \r\n  18. After calling Canal to confirm the accident was not covered, Lisa Meetze \r\n  returned the form to Caldwell with an attached note stating that \"Canal Insurance \r\n  Company will not cover this accident due to the fact that your policy was bound \r\n  at 12:45 p.m. and the accident occurred at 11:25 a.m.\"  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn \r\n  July 19, Canal issued Caldwell's insurance policy and filed a Form E \"Certificate \r\n  of Insurance\" with the Public Service Commission (PSC) as required. The PSC \r\n  accepted the filing on July 21. On September 27, however, Canal wrote a letter \r\n  to the PSC's staff counsel requesting an amendment to the Form E due to error. \r\n  The letter stated that Canal's initial filing reflected the correct date of \r\n  July 14, but that the preprinted Form E showed the effective time of the policy \r\n  as 12:01 a.m. when it should have read 12:45 p.m. The letter noted that Canal \r\n  desired a change on the form \"to reflect the company's intent that the filing \r\n  effective time and date is intended to coincide with the effective time and \r\n  date of the policy of insurance.\" On October 4, 1994 Canal sent Caldwell a notice \r\n  of cancellation of the policy, effective October 14.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn \r\n  the interim Canal filed a declaratory judgment action to determine its right \r\n  to deny coverage to Caldwell Trucking for the July 14 accident. Donna Parker, \r\n  individually and as guardian ad litem for her daughter Erika Hennington, who \r\n  was seriously injured in the accident, answered and counterclaimed for a declaration \r\n  that the accident was fully covered under Caldwell's policy with Canal. Both \r\n  parties subsequently moved for summary judgment and the trial court held a hearing \r\n  on January 21, 1997. By order dated March 17, 1997, the trial court granted \r\n  Canal's motion. A form judgment, entered on March 19, 1997, indicated that copies \r\n  were mailed to all attorneys of record.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn \r\n  June 24, 1997 Parker's counsel, apparently not having received a copy of the \r\n  judgment form, wrote counsel for Canal and inquired about the status of the \r\n  final order. Canal's attorney responded via fax and mail on July 8, expressing \r\n  surprise that opposing counsel had not been notified of the judgment and stating \r\n  that it had been entered on March 19 as Judgment Roll Number 211763. Thereafter, \r\n  on August 8, Parker's counsel wrote the clerk of court and requested a copy \r\n  of the judgment. He received the copy on August 12 and subsequently filed a \r\n  motion to reconsider on August 22. The trial court held a hearing on December \r\n  19. Over the objection of Canal's counsel, the court ruled that the motion to \r\n  reconsider was timely. On February 18, 1998, the trial court withdrew its prior \r\n  order from the previous March, and substituted a revised order dated February \r\n  3, 1998. It is from this order that Parker now appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, \r\n  Canal contends this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear Parker's \r\n  appeal. Rule 203(b), SCACR, requires a party to serve his notice of appeal within \r\n  thirty days after receiving written notice of the entry of a final order or \r\n  judgment, and failure to do so divests this court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  and results in dismissal of the appeal.First \r\n  Carolina Nat'l Bank v. A &amp; S Enterprises, Inc, 272 S.C. 339, 251 \r\n  S.E.2d 762 (1979); Burnett v. South \r\n  Carolina State Highway Dep't, 252 S.C. 568, 167 S.E.2d 571 (1969). When \r\n  a timely motion to alter or amend is made, \r\n  however, \"the time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed and shall run \r\n  from receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying such \r\n  motion.\" Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR. see \r\n  also Rule 59(f), SCRCP (\"The \r\n  time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed by a timely \r\n  motion under this Rule . . . .\") (emphasis added); Otten \r\n  v. Otten, 287 S.C. 166, 167, 337 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1985) (stating that \r\n  when a motion to alter or amend is made under Rule 59, \"the time for appeal \r\n  from the judgment begins to run from the time of the order granting or denying \r\n  the motion\"). To be timely, a post-trial motion to alter or amend must be served \r\n  within ten days of receipt of written notice of the entry of the original order \r\n  or judgment. Rule 59(e), SCRCP; Coward \r\n  Hund Constr. Co. v. Ball Corp., Op. No. 2989 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May \r\n  10, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 22). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEven \r\n  if Parker's counsel did not in fact receive the trial court's original form \r\n  order, there is no question that he received written notice of entry of the \r\n  judgment, including the judgment roll number, from opposing counsel on July \r\n  8, 1997. Cf. Priester \r\n  v. Priester, 131 S.C. 284, 127 S.E. 18 (1925) (wherein acceptable notice \r\n  of the filing of the trial court's decree was given by attorney to opposing \r\n  counsel). Because Parker's attorney waited a month to request a copy of the \r\n  order, his Motion for Reconsideration and Amendment of Judgment, served on August \r\n  22, was not timely. See Rule \r\n  59(f), SCRCP; Coward Hund, (Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 17 at 23). As a result, the motion did not stay the time for appeal \r\n  and Parker should have served notice on or before August 7. Parker, however, \r\n  did not serve a notice of appeal until March 17, 1998. Accordingly, this court \r\n  does not have subject matter jurisdiction in this matter. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn \r\n  any case, even if this appeal were timely, Parker would not prevail. In its \r\n  revised order, the trial court found, at least implicitly, that Caldwell's policy \r\n  with Canal became effective at 12:45 p.m. on July 14, 1994. Evidence in the \r\n  record, including the express agreement of the parties, the insurance policy \r\n  application, the policy itself, and the policy endorsements, fully supports \r\n  this finding. Parker, on the other hand, argues Caldwell's coverage began at \r\n  12:01 a.m. on July 14, because the \"Certificate of Insurance\" filed with the \r\n  PSC so stated. In this required filing, Canal inadvertently let the time preprinted \r\n  on the Form E, 12:01 a.m., remain after filling in the date, 7/14/94. Parker \r\n  claims this form essentially \"ratified\" 12:01 a.m. as the effective time of \r\n  the policy. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-23-910 (Supp. 1998), all motor vehicle carriers must \r\n  file with the PSC proof of liability and property damage insurance, a surety \r\n  bond, or a certificate of self-insurance before an operating certificate can \r\n  be granted. Such proof is typically offered by way of a standard Form E, wherein \r\n  the carrier's insurer certifies that the requisite coverage has been obtained. \r\n  The obvious purpose of this requirement is to ensure compliance with all aspects \r\n  of this state's motor vehicle carrier laws, and not, as Parker contends, to \r\n  determine the effective date of coverage of each carrier's policy. Cf. \r\n  Metcalf v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty \r\n  Co., 269 S.C. 309, 237 S.E.2d 370 (1977) (stating that effect of insurance \r\n  company's certificate asserting its insurance of Metcalf under state's financial \r\n  responsibility laws was to certify that the policy provided the statutory coverage); \r\n  National Serv. Fire Ins. Co. v. Jordan, \r\n  258 S.C. 56, 187 S.E.2d 230 (1972) (purpose of the written certificate of insurance \r\n  carrier was to certify that there was in effect a motor vehicle liability policy \r\n  for the benefit of Jordan, who was required to furnish proof of financial responsibility). \r\n  Furthermore, the policy on its face stated the effective time of coverage as \r\n  12:45 p.m. Caldwell agreed with this and all other company documents coincided. \r\n  We conclude the time referenced in the Form E filed by Canal was basically a \r\n  scrivener's error, especially in light of Canal's subsequent amendment letter. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nParker \r\n  also asserts Canal's coverage of Caldwell began at 12:01 a.m. because Canal \r\n  charged and retained a full day's premium for July 14. This argument is without \r\n  merit.  \r\n   \r\nIt \r\n  is undisputed Canal charged Caldwell a premium rated for a full day of coverage \r\n  on July 14. (2) Consequently, Parker contends \r\n  either waiver or estoppel precludes Canal from denying coverage for the full \r\n  day beginning at 12:01 a.m. While these defenses may apply in some cases when \r\n  an insurer accepts and retains a premium for coverage that by the terms of the \r\n  policy itself is excluded or terminated, they do not apply here. See \r\n  Pitts v. New York Life Ins. Co., \r\n  247 S.C. 545, 552, 148 S.E.2d 369, 371 (1966) (stating application of doctrines \r\n  of waiver and estoppel on this basis \"must of course depend upon the circumstances \r\n  of the particular case\"). Instead, in this instance, none of the elements of \r\n  estoppel are present. (3) Similarly, the record \r\n  contains no evidence of waiver, either implied or express. See \r\n  id. at 552, 148 S.E.2d at 371 \r\n  (stating that implied waiver \"results merely from conduct of the party against \r\n  whom the doctrine is invoked from which voluntary relinquishment of his known \r\n  right is reasonably inferable\"); Janasik \r\n  v. Fairway Oaks Villas, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992) \r\n  (\"A waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a \r\n  known right.\"); Bonnette v. State, \r\n  277 S.C. 17, 282 S.E.2d 597 (1981) (stating acts inconsistent with the continued \r\n  assertion of a right may give rise to a waiver). Parker has not met her burden \r\n  of proving either affirmative defense. See \r\n  Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 451 S.E.2d 924 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause \r\n  we find Caldwell's policy with Canal was effective at 12:45 p.m. on July 14, \r\n  and that no defense posited by Parker applies, the decision of the court below \r\n  is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY \r\n  and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n1.  The Shelton \r\n  Brown Agency had handled Caldwell Trucking's insurance business for several \r\n  years. Apparently, Hercules Caldwell usually financed his premium, often letting \r\n  as much as a month or more pass before paying the down payment to obtain a new \r\n  policy. Caldwell's prior policy lapsed on June 16, 1994, and no one from Caldwell \r\n  Trucking attempted to revive coverage until July 14. \r\n2.  Testimony \r\n  in the record confirms this is standard industry practice. Because the S.C. \r\n  Department of Insurance requires the filing of rates for commercial trucking \r\n  insurance based on annual premiums, the cost to the insurer is the \r\n  same per day whether coverage is bound at 12:01 a.m. or at any point thereafter. \r\n  In addition, coverage always expires one year from the date of the policy at \r\n  12:01 a.m., regardless of the time of day the policy was actually bound the \r\n  previous year. \r\n3.  The elements \r\n  of estoppel that must be shown are (1) ignorance of the party invoking it of \r\n  the truth as to the facts in question, (2) representations or conduct of the \r\n  party estopped which misled, (3) reliance upon such representation or conduct, \r\n  and (4) prejudicial change of position as a result of such reliance.Standard \r\n  Fire Co. v.

The trial court found both Penn National Mutual Casualty Insurance \r\n  Company (Penn National) and St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (St. \r\n  Paul) to be primary liability carriers, and determined both carriers must defend \r\n  and indemnify their insureds based on the allegations of negligence of Katherine \r\n  Foster, the driver. Both Penn National and St. Paul appeal. The remaining named \r\n  insurers are alleged to provide underinsured or uninsured coverage to various \r\n  parties which may be affected by the decision as to primary coverage in this \r\n  case. We affirm in part, and reverse in part. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLeasing Associates, Inc. (LAI), a \r\n  business which leased and sold cars, was the registered owner of an inventory \r\n  of vehicles, including a 1986 Ford Bronco. LAI maintained a Garage Liability \r\n  policy with Penn National. On May 16, 1994, LAI entered into a Plan and Agreement \r\n  of Reorganization with Southern National Bank of North Carolina (the Bank) whereby \r\n  the assets of LAI were purchased and transferred to the Bank's wholly owned \r\n  subsidiary, Southern National Leasing Corporation (SNLC). The reorganization \r\n  agreement was adopted, ratified, and approved by LAI's Board of Directors on \r\n  May 25, 1994.(2) The agreement provided that \r\n  LAI would not dissolve for a period of one year without the Bank's consent. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAs part of the acquisition, the Bank \r\n  executed an Assumption of Liabilities which provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPursuant to the Plan and Agreement \r\n  of Reorganization dated as of May 16, 1994, by and between Bank and [LAI] (hereinafter \r\n  \"Leasing\"), Bank hereby assumes the obligations, contracts and liabilities (herein \r\n  the \"Liabilities\") set forth on \"Schedule 2\" attached hereto(3) \r\n  and incorporated herein by reference. The Bank hereby agrees to be responsible \r\n  for and to perform and discharge, and to indemnify [LAI] against, the Liabilities. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe closing took place on June 6, \r\n  1994, at which time SNLC acquired substantially all of the assets of LAI.(4) \r\n  The 1986 Bronco which was involved in the collision giving rise to this litigation \r\n  was among the assets transferred. Thereafter, SNLC continued to operate the \r\n  business. Both the Bank and SNLC were insured by an Auto Liability Protection \r\n  Policy with St. Paul. Although SNLC acquired the Bronco after the effective \r\n  date of the St. Paul policy, it did not notify St. Paul of the acquisition. \r\n    \r\nJohn Robert Foster, Jr. (Mr. Foster), \r\n  was the general manager for LAI until the closing, and was thereafter employed \r\n  by SNLC. Mr. Foster decided to purchase a vehicle for his daughter, Katherine, \r\n  as she attained the age of sixteen. Mr. Foster allowed his daughter to test \r\n  drive various vehicles from SNLC's lot. Ultimately, they settled upon the Bronco. \r\n  Throughout the week of September 9, 1994, Katherine kept the Bronco for her \r\n  personal use, though Mr. Foster had not purchased it. Katherine, though quickly \r\n  approaching sixteen, was still fifteen years old and possessed a restricted \r\n  driver's license requiring her to drive under supervision after 8:00 p.m. On \r\n  September 9, after 8:00 p.m. and without supervision, Katherine and her passengers \r\n  proceeded in a course of conduct that ultimately resulted in a single-car accident. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe accident report listed LAI as \r\n  the owner of the Bronco. The Bronco was operated under a dealer's license plate \r\n  registered to LAI. When Penn National purchased the Bronco as salvage, LAI was \r\n  listed as the seller on the Application for Certificate of Title/Registration. \r\n  As a result of the accident, Foster's passengers, Pennell, Owens, Sitton, and \r\n  Ross, initiated tort actions against Katherine Foster, LAI, and SNLC.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA dispute arose between Penn National \r\n  and St. Paul as to which carrier was responsible for the defense of the tort \r\n  actions, which led to this declaratory judgment action. The parties stipulated \r\n  to the above recited facts, leaving the inferences to be decided by the trial \r\n  court sitting without a jury. The trial court found: 1) Foster had permission \r\n  from her father to drive the Bronco on the day of the wreck; 2) LAI had an insurable \r\n  interest on the day of the wreck notwithstanding the transfer of assets to SNLC; \r\n  3) LAI and SNLC each provided insurance for \"owned\" vehicles, and therefore, \r\n  both Penn National and St. Paul were primary insurers. Both insurers appeal. \r\n  We affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n   \r\n A declaratory judgment action to \r\n  determine which of two insurers has primary liability coverage is at law. Unisun \r\n  Ins. Co. v. First Southern Ins. Co., 314 S.C. 54, 443 S.E.2d 808 (Ct. App. \r\n  1994), aff'd as modified, 319 S.C. 419, 462 S.E.2d 260 (1995). A declaratory \r\n  judgment action to determine the coverage under an insurance policy's omnibus \r\n  clause is an action at law. United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Macloskie, \r\n  320 S.C. 459, 465 S.E.2d 759 (Ct. App. 1995). An action to declare excess or \r\n  secondary liability coverage is an action at law. State Auto Prop. &amp; \r\n  Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gibbs, 314 S.C. 345, 444 S.E.2d 504 (1994). In an action \r\n  at law tried without a jury, findings of fact made by the trial court have the \r\n  same force and effect as those of a jury; that is, the court's findings will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless without evidence which reasonably supports \r\n  the judge's findings. Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. \r\n  81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\n  \r\n   \r\nPENN NATIONAL'S \r\n  APPEAL\r\n I. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Penn National argues there \r\n  is no coverage for Katherine Foster under the policy issued to LAI because Foster \r\n  was not an \"insured\" as defined under the policy. The policy defines the \"insured\" \r\n  to include \"[a]nyone else while using with [LAI's] permission a covered 'auto' \r\n  [LAI] own[s], hire[s], or borrow[s] . . . .\" Because the Bronco was no longer \r\n  owned by LAI as a result of the asset transfer (there is no issue that the vehicle \r\n  was hired or borrowed), Penn National asserts Katherine Foster was not within \r\n  the definition of an insured. Though the trial court did not rule LAI owned \r\n  the vehicle the court held they had an \"insurable interest\", and thus, coverage \r\n  was still in effect covering the vehicle, and therefore, Katherine. We agree \r\n  with Penn National.  \r\n   \r\nThe issue of ownership is a question \r\n  of fact for purposes of coverage under insurance policies. South Carolina \r\n  Farm Bureau v. Scott, 274 S.C. 264, 262 S.E.2d 739 (1980). The determination \r\n  depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the case in question. Id. \r\n   Though a certificate of title constitutes prima facie evidence of \r\n  ownership for purposes of insurance coverage, this presumption can be rebutted \r\n  by evidence establishing someone other than the titleholder is the true owner. \r\n  Tollison v. Reaves, 277 S.C. 443, 445, 289 S.E.2d 163, 164 (1982).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Unisun Ins. Co. v. First Southern \r\n  Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 419, 462 S.E.2d 260 (1995), our supreme court was faced \r\n  with a similar fact situation. We believe Unisun provides guidance here. \r\n  In Unisun, the driver of a Subaru automobile, named Peters, was at fault \r\n  in an accident. Peters' use of the Subaru arose from an agreement negotiated \r\n  between Peters' father and Subaru Center as a part of the father's sale of the \r\n  Subaru dealership. Under the agreement, Peters' father received the use of three \r\n  new vehicles per year for ten years. The certificates of origin on the untitled \r\n  vehicles remained in Subaru Center's name, and as each vehicle accumulated 6000 \r\n  miles, they were exchanged for new ones, and Subaru Center then sold them as \r\n  demonstrators, retaining all of the sales proceeds. Peters' father maintained \r\n  his own automobile liability policy which named him as the insured even though \r\n  the agreement obligated Subaru Center to maintain insurance. Subaru Center maintained \r\n  a dealership policy covering the vehicles, on which it was the named insured. \r\n  After both insurers settled the underlying tort action, the father's insurer \r\n  sued the dealership's insurer seeking to recover its portion of the settlement. \r\n  The supreme court found the Subaru Center was the sole owner of the Subaru reasoning: \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThis Court had held that under certain \r\n  circumstances, someone other than the actual titleholder should be deemed the \r\n  owner for insurance purposes. In those cases, however, the owner's failure's \r\n  to hold title (or its equivalent) resulted from mere technicalities. See, \r\n  e.g., Tollison v. Reaves, 277 S.C. 443, 289 S.E.2d 163 (1982) (finding \r\n  person \"true owner\" of automobile titled to his mother, because person considered \r\n  himself the owner, made the down payment and all other payments on the automobile, \r\n  held his own insurance on automobile, and had sole possession); Grain Dealers \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co. v. Julian, 247 S.C. 89, 145 S.E.2d 685 (1965) (holding a person \r\n  not holding title was true owner where person had purchased and paid for automobile \r\n  and possessed a bill of sale); State Auto Ins. Co. v. Stuart, 287 S.C. \r\n  235, 337 S.E.2d 698 (Ct. App. 1985) (person not holding title found to be owner \r\n  of car where titleholder had loaned that person money to purchase car, had issued \r\n  bill of sale, and had transferred possession). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, Peters' failure to hold the \r\n  Certificate of Origin for the Subaru was not a mere formality. In fact, his \r\n  \"exclusive possession and control\" of the vehicle was only temporary, as he \r\n  had a duty to return the vehicle to Subaru Center after the car reached 6,000 \r\n  miles. Peters had no duty to maintain insurance on the automobile. Upon the \r\n  sale of the vehicle, Subaru Center was entitled to all the proceeds. These facts \r\n  clearly distinguish this case from prior cases in which a person not holding \r\n  title to an automobile nevertheless was found to be the true owner. Because \r\n  there are no facts reasonably supporting a finding Peters owned the Subaru, \r\n  the Court of Appeals correctly found Subaru Center was the sole owner.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 424, 462 S.E.2d at \r\n  262-63. \r\n   \r\nIn Unisun the supreme court \r\n  recognized that Subaru Center's entitlement to the proceeds upon sale, reservation \r\n  of ultimate possession and control over the vehicles, and undertaking to provide \r\n  insurance were factors leading to the conclusion that Subaru Center was the \r\n  owner of the vehicle involved in the collision. Coupled with the prima facie \r\n  evidence of ownership by virtue of holding the certificate of origin, the supreme \r\n  court found no evidence reasonably supporting the trial court's inference of \r\n  co-ownership. \r\n   \r\n\r\nIn this case the parties stipulated \r\nthat \"[t]he Bronco Katherine Foster was driving at the time of the accident was \r\nincluded on a list of assets transferred from LAI to SNLC on June 6, 1994, as \r\npart of the fleet of 37 automobiles conveyed to it by LAI.\" This stipulation referenced \r\na \"Bill of Sale and Assignment dated June 6, 1994, with Schedules of Assets.\" \r\nThe Bill of Sale and Assignment stated, in pertinent part: \"[f]urther, Assignor \r\nagrees and represents to Bank and Assignee that Assignor will execute such documents \r\nand take such actions as may be necessary or convenient to effect the transfer \r\nof title in the assets.\" LAI was only temporarily listed as the owner, until the \r\nproper paperwork was completed. The parties further stipulated that SNLC continued \r\nto operate the business of selling and leasing automobiles, and SNLC maintained \r\nsole possession of the Bronco. Furthermore, SNLC was entitled to the proceeds \r\nfrom sale of the transferred vehicles, including the Bronco.(5) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the unique circumstances of \r\n  this case, we find the presumption of LAI's ownership as titleholder was clearly \r\n  rebutted. See Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Julian, 247 S.C. \r\n  89, 145 S.E.2d 685 (1965)(holding a person not holding title was true owner \r\n  where person had purchased and paid for automobile and possessed a bill of sale). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nWe find no basis under the wording \r\n  of the Penn National policy upon which to support the trial court's finding \r\n  of coverage. The court's conclusion that LAI maintained an insurable interest \r\n  in the vehicle is irrelevant to the inquiry. The terms of the policy govern \r\n  the scope of the coverage, unless in conflict with statutory requirements. \r\n  Robinson v. Georgia Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 235 S.C. 178, \r\n  110 S.E.2d 255 (1959) (although having an insurable interest is generally recognized \r\n  as a prerequisite to recovery under a policy, it is not sufficient to trigger \r\n  coverage under a liability policy where the omnibus clause by its terms limits \r\n  coverage to automobiles owned by the insured. The relevant inquiry under such \r\n  indemnity policies is ownership, not whether the named insured has an insurable \r\n  interest). Katherine Foster was not the named insured, and was not operating \r\n  a vehicle owned, hired or borrowed by LAI. Consequently, the Penn National policy \r\n  did not provide coverage to her.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nST. PAUL'S APPEAL \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSt. Paul first argues its policy \r\n  does not afford coverage because SNLC did not own the Bronco. In light of our \r\n  disposition of this issue as it regarded Penn National's appeal, we find this \r\n  argument to be without merit. \r\nII. \r\n   \r\nSt. Paul next argues the Bronco was \r\n  not a \"covered auto\" because SNLC failed to notify St. Paul of its acquisition \r\n  within 30 days. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSt. Paul's policy lists several types \r\n  of autos which are \"covered autos.\" As referenced in the \"Auto Coverage Summary\" \r\n  of the policy, SNLC specifically purchased \"any auto\" coverage instead of \"scheduled \r\n  auto\" coverage. The policy states that \"any auto\" coverage means \"any owned, \r\n  rented, leased or borrowed auto. It includes hired, nonowned, newly acquired, \r\n  replacement and temporary substitute autos.\" (Emphasis added.) \"Newly acquired\" \r\n  autos include any additional autos acquired while the agreement is in effect. \r\n  \"Scheduled autos\" coverage, on the other hand, includes \"newly acquired\" autos \r\n  only if the insured notifies the carrier within 30 days of acquisition that \r\n  coverage is needed.  \r\n   \r\nSt. Paul argues the Bronco, as a \r\n  \"newly acquired\" auto, was subject to the 30 day notice requirement. However, \r\n  the notice requirement only applies to \"Scheduled autos.\" There is no requirement \r\n  that SNLC give St. Paul 30 days notice under the \"any auto\" coverage, and a \r\n  \"newly acquired\" auto is specifically included within the description of the \r\n  \"any auto\" coverage which SNLC contracted to receive. Consequently, the Bronco \r\n  was a \"covered auto\" under the St. Paul policy.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n III. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSt. Paul next contends that the policy \r\n  affords no coverage to Katherine Foster because she did not have permission \r\n  to drive the Bronco at the time of the accident. Because Katherine Foster had \r\n  a restricted license, St. Paul contends she exceeded the scope of any permission \r\n  she may have had by driving after 8:00p.m..  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Whether coverage exists under an \r\n  omnibus clause is a question of fact, and our review is limited to a determination \r\n  of whether any evidence exists to sustain the trial court's findings of fact. \r\n   Allstate Ins. Co. v. Federated Mut. Implement &amp; Hardware Ins. Co., \r\n  251 S.C. 203, 205, 161 S.E.2d 240, 241 (1968). The burden of proof rests with \r\n  the party seeking to rely on the omnibus clause. Id. at 205-06, 161 S.E.2d \r\n  at 241. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court made a factual finding \r\n  that Foster was a permitted user. The trial court did not consider whether Foster \r\n  exceeded the scope of her permission, noting that Penn National failed to raise \r\n  the issue as an affirmative defense. St. Paul now argues it raised the issue \r\n  before the trial court and in a post-trial motion, and the trial court erred \r\n  in failing to rule on the issue. Regardless, we find the policy's omnibus clause \r\n  so broad that Foster could not have exceeded the scope of permission so as to \r\n  exclude coverage as a matter of law. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 392, 179 S.E.2d 203 (1971), the supreme \r\n  court interpreted an omnibus clause where the parties stipulated the policy \r\n  coverage was that required under the statute. The statutory language in question \r\n  was the predecessor to section 38-77-30(6) (unmodified), and stated in pertinent \r\n  part: \"'[i]nsured' means . . . any person who uses with \r\n  the consent, expressed or implied, of the named insured the motor vehicle \r\n  to which the coverage applies . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(6) (1989) (emphasis \r\n  added). In interpreting the statute, the supreme court refused to recognize \r\n  a distinction between the \"use\" for which the vehicle has been permitted and \r\n  the permitted \"operation.\" However, the court determined that under the statutory \r\n  definition \"[c]onsent must run to the 'person who uses,' as well as to the \r\n  use he makes.\" Id. at 396, 179 S.E.2d at 205 (emphasis added). Because \r\n  the insured's son was specifically forbidden from allowing anyone else to drive \r\n  the car, the court held the third party driver was not an insured under the \r\n  omnibus statute.(6) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Maryland Cas. Co. v. State \r\n  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 312 S.C. 476, 478, 441 S.E.2d 338, 339 (Ct. App. \r\n  1994), however, this court found the policy definition broader than that set \r\n  forth in the statute. The policy in that case provided coverage for \"damages \r\n  which an insured becomes legally liable to pay because of bodily injury to other \r\n  . . . ,\" and defined an \"Insured\" as \"any other person while using such a car \r\n  if its use is within the scope of consent by you [named insured] or your \r\n  spouse.\" (emphasis added). This court concluded that the only relevant inquiry, \r\n  in view of the policy language, was whether the \"actual use\" of the vehicle \r\n  was permitted, regardless of whether the person driving the vehicle had been \r\n  given permission to use it. The court stated \"under . . . the plain meaning \r\n  of the language of the policy, consent from the named insured need only flow \r\n  to the use of the vehicle itself.\" Maryland Cas. Co., at 480, 441 S.E.2d \r\n  at 340. In so holding, this court relied upon the well recognized principle \r\n  that an automobile insurance policy can, by its language, provide greater coverage \r\n  than the minimum required by statute.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the omnibus clause \r\n  in the St. Paul policy lists five categories as persons \"protected under this \r\n  agreement\" including \"[a]ny permitted user.\" This category provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAny permitted user. \r\n  Any person or organization to whom you've given permission to use \r\n  a covered auto you own, rent, lease, hire or borrow is a protected person. \r\n  (Emphasis added.)  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n We find this language, like that \r\n  in Maryland Cas. Co., supra, clearly provides coverage broader \r\n  than required by the statutory language of section 38-77-30(6). St. Paul's policy \r\n  affords coverage to anyone with permission to use the covered vehicle, without \r\n  reference to permission for a particular use of the vehicle. Katherine Foster \r\n  clearly qualifies as a person with permission to use a covered auto. There is \r\n  no requirement that the use must be within the scope of permission. Foster was \r\n  a person with permission to use a covered auto, and that is all that is required \r\n  to trigger coverage. Her conduct on the date of the accident has no bearing \r\n  on this issue.  \r\n   \r\nAs an agent of SNLC, in the business \r\n  of selling and leasing automobiles, Mr. Foster unquestionably had unfettered \r\n  authority to allow third parties to test drive his employer's autos. Thus, Mr. \r\n  Foster clearly had the authority to permit Katherine Foster to drive the car. \r\n  The grant of initial permission to Katherine was never questioned. The parties \r\n  stipulated that \"Mr. Foster allowed Katherine Foster to test drive the \r\n  Bronco . . . He allowed Katherine Foster to use the Bronco the day of the accident.\" \r\n  Accordingly, the St. Paul policy affords coverage to Katherine Foster under \r\n  the omnibus clause of the policy. \r\nIV. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, St. Paul contends the trial \r\n  court erred by finding it afforded primary liability coverage. St. Paul argues \r\n  any coverage would be excess to Penn National, because Penn National's insured \r\n  owned the Bronco.  \r\n   \r\nSt. Paul's policy states: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis agreement is primary insurance \r\n  for covered autos you own and excess insurance for those you don't own. . . \r\n  . When insurance provided by another insurer applies to covered bodily injury \r\n  or property damage that results from an accident on the same primary or excess \r\n  basis as this agreement, we'll pay only our share of your accident. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe question then is whether LAI \r\n  or SNLC owned the vehicle for insurance purposes. In light of our disposition \r\n  on this issue, it is clear that St. Paul's policy affords primary coverage. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn conclusion, we find the trial \r\n  court's determination that coverage is afforded under the Penn National policy \r\n  based on LAI's insurable interest to be unsupported by the stipulated facts. \r\n  We further find the Bronco was owned by SNLC, triggering coverage under St. \r\n  Paul's policy. Katherine Foster qualified as an \"insured\" permissive user and \r\n  the Bronco was a \"covered auto\" under the policy definitions. Finally, St. Paul \r\n  owes primary coverage by virtue of the ownership of the Bronco and the provisions \r\n  of the St. Paul policy.  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, and REVERSED \r\n  IN PART. \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HEARN, JJ., concur. \r\n   \r\n1.

Muhammed appeals. We \r\n  affirm.  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n    FACTUAL \r\n    BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nMuhammed, who lived in Charleston, \r\n  and his friend Kelon Hardin were at 312 Arnold Street in Rock Hill on the afternoon \r\n  of June 25, 1997. The house belonged to Hardin's cousin, Lasheba Simpson. Based \r\n  on an informant's tip, Rock Hill police officers were also in the area looking \r\n  for a black Ford Escort driven by two men. The officers drove past the house \r\n  and spotted a black Escort. Muhammed and Hardin were on the front porch. By \r\n  the time other officers arrived, Muhammed and Hardin had walked away from the \r\n  house in different directions. Officer Charles Grant stopped Muhammed, who consented \r\n  to being searched. Officer Grant found nothing incriminating, but detained him \r\n  and drove him back to 312 Arnold Street. Muhammed had a set of keys in his pants \r\n  pocket. \r\n   \r\nThe front door was open and Officer \r\n  Grant walked inside and secured the house. Simpson, the owner, returned home \r\n  and consented to a search of the premises. The house had two bedrooms, one of \r\n  which was locked with a padlock. Simpson had a key to the lock, and one of the \r\n  keys from Muhammed's set of keys opened the lock. Inside the bedroom, the officers \r\n  found 19.7 grams of crack cocaine stored with shoes in a men's tennis shoe box. \r\n  Fingerprint testing resulted in no useable latent prints. The shoe box was in \r\n  a mesh laundry-type bag. The officers also found and seized two pistols. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMuhammed consented to a search of \r\n  the Escort. From under the passenger seat, the police retrieved forty-two .32 \r\n  caliber bullets inside a sock. Other items found in the vehicle included three \r\n  pagers, two of which were clipped to the driver's visor; and a razor blade which \r\n  later tested to have trace cocaine (1). From \r\n  the trunk, the police retrieved a cellular telephone, a telephone recording \r\n  device, and $1,085 in cash rolled up in a rubber band. Muhammed and Hardin were \r\n  arrested and tried together. Hardin was acquitted on all counts. Muhammed was \r\n  convicted of the drug charges. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Muhammed argues the trial \r\n  judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on all \r\n  charges as there was no evidence Muhammed had dominion and control over the \r\n  drugs and the evidence raised a mere suspicion of his guilt. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion \r\n  for directed verdict in a criminal case, the evidence must be viewed in the \r\n  light most favorable to the state. State \r\n  v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997); State \r\n  v. Green, 327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  This court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence and \r\n  not its weight. Huggins, 325 \r\n  S.C. at 110, 481 S.E.2d at 118; Green, \r\n  327 S.C. at 586, 491 S.E.2d at 265. In order to survive a motion for directed \r\n  verdict, the state must present any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendant's guilt, or from which \r\n  the defendant's guilt can be fairly and logically deduced. State \r\n  v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); Green, \r\n  327 S.C. at 587, 491 S.E.2d at 265. Accordingly, the trial judge should grant \r\n  the motion for directed verdict in those cases where the evidence merely raises \r\n  a suspicion that the defendant is guilty. State \r\n  v. Green, 327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n In the instant case, we find there \r\n  was sufficient evidence to submit the case to the jury. One is guilty of trafficking \r\n  when he \"[k]nowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, purchases, or brings into \r\n  this State . . . or is knowingly in actual or constructive possession . . . \r\n  of ten grams or more of ice, crank, or crack cocaine.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(Supp. \r\n  1998). \"It is a separate criminal offense for a person to distribute, sell, \r\n  purchase, manufacture, or to unlawfully possess with intent to distribute, a \r\n  controlled substance while in, on, or within a one-half mile radius of the grounds \r\n  of a . . . park.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(A)(Supp. 1998).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nConviction of possession requires \r\n  proof of possession, either actual or constructive, coupled with knowledge of \r\n  its presence. State v. Hudson, \r\n  277 S.C. 200, 284 S.E.2d 773 (1981). \"Actual possession occurs when the drugs \r\n  are found to be in the actual physical custody of the person charged with possession. \r\n  To prove constructive possession, the State must show a defendant had dominion \r\n  and control, or the right to exercise dominion and control. . . . Constructive \r\n  possession can be established by circumstantial as well as direct evidence, \r\n  and possession may be shared.\" Id. \r\n  at 202-3, 284 S.E.2d at 774-75.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"Where contraband materials are found \r\n  on premises under the control of the accused, this fact in and of itself gives \r\n  rise to an inference of knowledge and possession which may be sufficient to \r\n  carry the case to the jury.\" Hudson, \r\n  277 S.C. at 203, 284 S.E.2d at 775. \"[C]onstructive possession occurs when the \r\n  person charged with possession has dominion and control over either the drugs \r\n  or the premises upon which the drugs are found.\" State \r\n  v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 199, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (citing State \r\n  v. Ellis, 263 S.C. 12, 207 S.E.2d 408 (1974)). Possession requires more \r\n  than mere presence. The State must show the defendant had dominion or control \r\n  over the thing allegedly possessed or had the right to exercise dominion or \r\n  control over it. State v. Ellis, \r\n  263 S.C. 12, 23, 207 S.E.2d 408, 413 (1974) (citing State \r\n  v. Tabory, 260 S.C. 355, 196 S.E.2d 111 (1973)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The trial court properly denied \r\n  Muhammed's motion for a directed verdict because the record contains sufficient \r\n  evidence to fairly and logically deduce guilt. Because no drugs were found on \r\n  Muhammed's person, our analysis proceeds under constructive possession. We find \r\n  the record establishes sufficient evidence Muhammed exercised dominion and control \r\n  over the cocaine.  \r\n   \r\nThe informant, a local drug dealer, \r\n  testified he was playing poker at a convenience store when Hardin approached \r\n  him, presenting a drug deal. The informant testified Hardin had a sealed plastic \r\n  bag filled to the top with individual rocks of crack and two pistols. The informant \r\n  testified Muhammed was with Hardin at the time, sitting in the car. The deal \r\n  was not consummated. The informant testified he told Hardin they were on his \r\n  \"turf\" and any drug dealing would be done by the informant. The following day, \r\n  the informant testified, he again saw Hardin and Muhammed in the neighborhood, \r\n  and followed their black Escort. The informant notified Officer Grant of the \r\n  Rock Hill police, giving descriptions of the car, Hardin and Muhammed, and the \r\n  house.\r\n \r\nOfficer Grant testified Muhammed \r\n  consented to a search of his person. Grant testified Muhammed had keys in his \r\n  pocket but he did not recover them at that time. Another officer then searched \r\n  the vehicle, with Muhammed's consent, and discovered the razor, cash, telephone \r\n  equipment, and pagers. Grant further testified some crack was found on the ground \r\n  near the house. When Simpson consented to a search of her house, the officers \r\n  discovered the locked bedroom. Grant testified he retrieved a key from Muhammed's \r\n  key ring to unlock the bedroom. The key ring also held keys to the black Escort. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nSimpson testified Muhammed and Hardin \r\n  had been visiting her for two days prior to this incident, and had access to \r\n  the house while she was gone. She testified one of them carried a mesh bag of \r\n  boxed shoes into the bedroom. Simpson further testified she arrived home one \r\n  day and Muhammed and Hardin were putting a lock on the bedroom door. They claimed \r\n  to be locking up their cooler of food and beverages to prevent their use by \r\n  other visitors. Simpson testified they gave her one key and Muhammed kept the \r\n  other key. Simpson also testified the crack did not belong to her. Simpson denied \r\n  the key to the bedroom belonged to her brother, Pedro. Simpson referred to Muhammed \r\n  in her testimony by the nickname \"Smurf.\" (2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe conclude there was sufficient \r\n  evidence of Muhammed's control over the drugs for the trial judge to properly \r\n  deny Muhammed's motion for a directed verdict. Muhammed argues this court should \r\n  reverse this decision in light of United \r\n  States v. Dunlap, 28 F.3d 823 (8th Cir. 1994). In Dunlap, \r\n  two police officers observed Dunlap's apartment as the result of informant tips. \r\n  One of the officers left to apply for a search warrant. Dunlap's girlfriend \r\n  left the apartment, returning approximately ten minutes later with Cornelius \r\n  Coleman. The officers had no information about Coleman, and had not observed \r\n  him during their surveillance. As both officers approached the apartment with \r\n  the search warrant, Dunlap opened the door from the inside. Coleman was standing \r\n  inside the apartment, and had a handgun in his pocket. The officers found cocaine \r\n  base in the kitchen, and cocaine powder in the bedroom. After his arrest, Coleman \r\n  asked the officers to retrieve his hat from the kitchen. Coleman was convicted \r\n  of possession with intent to distribute, and a related firearms charge.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nColeman argued the evidence against \r\n  him was insufficient to support the jury's verdict. The court agreed and reversed \r\n  the conviction, finding constructive possession should not be lightly imputed \r\n  to one found in another's apartment or home. The court looked at the closeness \r\n  of the relationship between the appellant and the person whose actual possession \r\n  is not disputed, the presence or absence of valuable or important personal items \r\n  belonging to the appellant, and the degree to which the actual relationship \r\n  between the appellant and the actual possessor was related to criminal activity. \r\n  The court found the evidence could not allow a reasonable jury to be convinced \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that Coleman had constructive possession of the cocaine \r\n  or that he aided or abetted Dunlap. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe do not find Dunlap \r\n  dispositive of this case. Muhammed had a key to the bedroom on his person, and \r\n  unrestricted access to the house. We find substantially more evidence of Muhammed's \r\n  constructive possession of the drugs in this case than the government offered \r\n  in Dunlap. Accordingly, the \r\n  conviction is  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n \r\n1.  The police \r\n  were unable to determine whether the cocaine was powder or crack cocaine. \r\n2.  Officer Jeter \r\n  also participated in the surveillance of Simpson's house and the Escort. \r\n   Jeter testified Muhammed's key ring contained a cartoon \"Smurf\" character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3077","title":"Towles, M.

We reverse. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnited is a nationwide company headquartered \r\n  and incorporated in Minnesota which maintains offices, corporate subsidiaries, \r\n  HMO's, and managed health plans under management contracts throughout the United \r\n  States. In South Carolina, United provides managerial and other related services \r\n  for the South Carolina corporation, Physician's Health Plan (PHP). Winfield \r\n  C. Towles began working as a medical director for United in September 1995 and \r\n  was assigned to PHP. (1)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn February 1996, Towles signed a \r\n  Code of Conduct and Employee Handbook Acknowledgment form (the Acknowledgment). \r\n  The Acknowledgment stated that \"the provisions in this Handbook are guidelines \r\n  and, except for the provisions of the Employment Arbitration Policy, do not \r\n  establish a contract or any particular terms or condition of employment between \r\n  myself and [United].\" The Employment Arbitration Policy, which is summarized \r\n  in the Acknowledgment and employee handbook, stated in part: \"Arbitration is \r\n  the final, exclusive and required forum for the resolution of all employment \r\n  related disputes which are based on a legal claim.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn September 1996, United terminated \r\n  Towles. According to Towles, a former co-worker subsequently told an employee \r\n  of a different hospital that United terminated Towles for sexual harassment. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTowles then sued United, PHP, PHP's \r\n  president, and two co-workers alleging defamation, conspiracy, negligent supervision, \r\n  wrongful discharge, unfair or deceptive trade practices, and reckless or intentional \r\n  infliction of emotional distress. In response, United filed a motion to dismiss, \r\n  or in the alternative, a motion to compel arbitration. The circuit court denied \r\n  United's motion to dismiss. The circuit court also denied United's motion to \r\n  compel arbitration \"with leave to refile it after completing discovery in this \r\n  action.\" United appeals, contending the circuit court erred in denying United's \r\n  motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). See \r\n  9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1 et seq. (1999). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe must initially determine whether \r\n  United may appeal from the circuit court's order. United contends the circuit \r\n  court's order is appealable under both federal and state law. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBoth federal and state policy favor \r\n  arbitrating disputes. Heffner v. Destiny, \r\n  Inc., 321 S.C. 536, 537, 471 S.E.2d 135, 136 (1995) (\"The policy of the \r\n  United States and this State is to favor arbitration of disputes.\"). This preference \r\n  for arbitration has manifested itself in legislation and judicial decisions \r\n  supporting the expeditious appeal of decisions denying an application to compel \r\n  arbitration.  \r\n   \r\nThe FAA states: \"An appeal may be \r\n  taken from . . . an order . . . denying an application under section 206 of \r\n  this title to compel arbitration.\" 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 16(a)(1)(C) (1999). Enacting \r\n  this provision revealed Congress's \"deliberate determination that appeal rules \r\n  should reflect a strong policy favoring arbitration.\" Stedor \r\n  Enter., Ltd. v. Armtex, Inc., 947 F.2d 727, 730 (4th Cir. \r\n  1991) (quoting 15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal \r\n  Practice and Procedure Â§ 3914.34, at 412 (Supp. 1990)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina's statutory law provides \r\n  a similar framework. South Carolina's Uniform Arbitration Act states: \"[a]n \r\n  appeal may be taken from . . . [a]n order denying an application to compel arbitration \r\n  made under Â§ 15-48-20.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-200(a)(1) (Supp. 1998). Therefore, \r\n  \"an order that favors litigation over arbitration-whether it refuses to stay \r\n  the litigation in deference to arbitration; refuses to compel arbitration; . \r\n  . . or grants, continues, or modifies an injunction against arbitration-is immediately \r\n  appealable, even if interlocutory.\" \r\n  Stedor, 947 F.2d at 730 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n \r\nThe circuit court's order stated: \r\n  \"[D]efendants' motion to compel arbitration is denied, at this time, with leave \r\n  to refile it at the completion of discovery in this action.\" The circuit court's \r\n  order favored litigation over arbitration by refusing to compel arbitration \r\n  until the parties conducted additional discovery. Therefore, United may appeal \r\n  the circuit court's order denying its motion to compel arbitration. See \r\n  9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 16(a)(1)(C) (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-200(a)(1) (Supp. 1998); \r\n  Stedor, 947 F.2d at 730. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHaving concluded the circuit court's \r\n  order is appealable, we now address United's contention that the circuit court \r\n  erred in denying United's motion to compel arbitration under the FAA. To analyze \r\n  United's contention we must evaluate (1) whether the FAA applies, (2) whether \r\n  United and Towles formed a valid and binding arbitration agreement, and (3) \r\n  whether the agreement covers Towles's claims. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the FAA to apply, an agreement \r\n  must \"evidenc[e] a transaction involving commerce,\" specifically interstate \r\n  commerce. (2) 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2 (1999); see \r\n  also Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way \r\n  Envtl., Inc., 323 S.C. 454, 460, 476 S.E.2d 149, 152 (1996). The terms \r\n  \"involving commerce\" amount to the functional equivalent of \"affecting commerce\" \r\n  and signal \"an intent to exercise Congress' commerce clause power to the full.\" \r\n  Allied-Bruce Terminix Co. v. Dobson, \r\n  513 U.S. 265, 277 (1995); see also Mathews \r\n  v. Fluor Corp., 312 S.C. 404, 407, 440 S.E.2d 880, 881 (1994) (\"The requirement \r\n  that the underlying transaction involve commerce is to be broadly construed \r\n  so as to be coextensive with congressional power to regulate under the Commerce \r\n  Clause.\"). The phrase \"evidencing a transaction\" only requires \"that the 'transaction' \r\n  in fact 'involv[e]' interstate commerce, even if the parties did not contemplate \r\n  an interstate commerce connection.\" Allied-Bruce \r\n  Terminix Co., 513 U.S. at 277-81. To ascertain whether a transaction \r\n  involves commerce within the meaning of the FAA, the court must examine the \r\n  agreement, the complaint, and the surrounding facts. Soil \r\n  Remediation Co., 323 S.C. at 460, 476 S.E.2d at 152.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTowles's \r\n  responsibilities included helping to establish medical policy, overseeing utilization \r\n  review and quality management for plan participants, attending out of state \r\n  conferences, participating in telephone conferences with United's corporate \r\n  medical affairs staff in Minnesota, and reviewing claims from out-of-state providers \r\n  and specialty providers located in North Carolina and Georgia. Towles participated \r\n  in sales presentations in South Carolina and Georgia and worked with officials \r\n  from national companies in resolving questions of utilization review and medical \r\n  necessity for PHP participants. Towles also reviewed proposals for services \r\n  from out-of-state medical and ancillary service providers. We find Towles's \r\n  activities provide sufficient evidence of interstate commerce to invoke the \r\n  FAA. See Allied-Bruce Terminix \r\n  Co., 513 U.S. at 277 (noting the FAA signaled Congress's intent to exercise \r\n  its Commerce Clause powers to the full). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause \r\n  interstate commerce is involved, the FAA applies and displaces South Carolina's \r\n  Uniform Arbitration Act. See Soil \r\n  Remediation Co., 323 S.C. at 459-60, 476 S.E.2d at 152 (noting the FAA \r\n  preempts South Carolina's Uniform Arbitration Act). Therefore, if an arbitration \r\n  agreement which covers Towles's claims exists, the FAA requires arbitration. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnited \r\n  contends the Acknowledgment created a valid, binding agreement requiring arbitration. \r\n  We agree. \r\n   \r\nArbitration \r\n  is available only when the parties involved contractually agree to arbitrate. \r\n  General Drivers, Warehousemen and Helpers \r\n  Local Union No. 509 v. Ethyl Corp., 68 F.3d 80, 83 (4th Cir. \r\n  1995). There is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of arbitration \r\n  agreements because of the strong policy favoring arbitration. O'Neil \r\n  v. Hilton Head Hosp., 115 F.3d 272, 273 (4th Cir. 1997); Heffner, \r\n  321 S.C. at 537, 471 S.E.2d at 136. In determining whether an agreement to arbitrate \r\n  exists, \"the court should apply 'ordinary state-law principles that govern the \r\n  formation of contracts.' \" Johnson \r\n  v. Circuit City Stores, 148 F.3d 373, 377 (4th Cir. 1998) \r\n  (quoting First Options of Chicago, \r\n  Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995)); see also Arrants \r\n  v. Buck, 130 F.3d 636, 640 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"Courts decide \r\n  whether there is an agreement to arbitrate according to common law principles \r\n  of contract law.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTowles \r\n  contends he never received actual notice of the arbitration provisions thus \r\n  precluding him from assenting to arbitration. Accordingly, Towles argues the \r\n  Acknowledgment failed to create a binding arbitration agreement. Towles cites \r\n  Fleming v. Borden, Inc., 316 \r\n  S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d 589 (1994) for the proposition that an employee handbook \r\n  constitutes a binding contract only when the employee has actual notice of the \r\n  provisions in the handbook and a jury should decide whether an employee received \r\n  actual notice. We find Towles's reliance on Fleming \r\n  v. Borden is misplaced for at least two reasons.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFirst, \r\n  the Fleming case does not focus \r\n  on the need for actual notice when an employee handbook creates an employment \r\n  contract, but rather holds that an employee must receive actual notice when \r\n  an employer modifies an existing employee handbook. Id. \r\n  at 460-3, 450 S.E.2d at 594-6. Second, although a jury normally decides whether \r\n  a contract exists when there is conflicting evidence, in the present case, we \r\n  find the evidence leaves room for only one inference: that the Acknowledgment \r\n  constituted a binding arbitration agreement. (3) \r\n  See Small v. Springs Indus., \r\n  Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 483, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454 (1987) (noting \"a trial \r\n  court should submit to the jury the issue of existence of a contract when its \r\n  existence is questioned and the evidence is either conflicting or admits of \r\n  more than one inference\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMost employment contracts are unilateral. \r\n  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., \r\n  Op. No. 24948 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 1, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 19, \r\n  at 21). \"A unilateral contract has the following three elements: 1) a specific \r\n  offer, 2) communication of the offer to the employee, and 3) performance of \r\n  job duties in reliance on the offer.\" Id. \r\n  at 21-2. There is no mutuality of obligation in a unilateral contract; there \r\n  is only one promisor and one promisee for whom the contract creates a legally \r\n  enforceable right. Fleming, \r\n  316 S.C. at 460-1, 450 S.E.2d at 594. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTowles signed the Acknowledgment \r\n  which provided in pertinent part:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI acknowledge that I have received \r\n  a copy of the United HealthCare Corporation (UHC) code of Conduct and the Employee \r\n  Handbook. I understand that these documents contain important information on \r\n  UHC's general personnel policies and on my obligations as an employee. I will \r\n  remain familiar with, and agree to abide by these policies.\r\n* * *\r\nAt-Will \r\n  Employment \r\n   \r\nI understand that the provisions \r\n  in this Handbook are guidelines and, except for the provisions of the Employment \r\n  Arbitration Policy, do not establish a contract or any particular terms or condition \r\n  of employment between myself and [United].\r\n* * *\r\nI understand that arbitration is \r\n  the final, exclusive and required forum for the resolution of all employment \r\n  related disputes which are based on a legal claim. I agree to submit all employment \r\n  related disputes based on a legal claim to arbitration under [United's] policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter receiving and signing the Acknowledgment, \r\n  Towles cannot legitimately claim United failed to provide actual notice of the \r\n  arbitration provisions because the law does not impose a duty to explain a document's \r\n  contents to an individual when the individual can learn the contents from simply \r\n  reading the document. Citizens and \r\n  Southern Nat'l Bank v. Lanford, 313 S.C. 540, 545, 443 S.E.2d 549, 551 \r\n  (1994); Burwell v. South Carolina Nat'l \r\n  Bank, 288 S.C. 34, 39, 340 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1986)(noting that \"every \r\n  contracting party owes a duty to the other party to the contract and to the \r\n  public to learn the contents of a document before he signs it\"); see also \r\n  First Baptist Church of Timmonsville \r\n  v. George A. Creed &amp; Son, Inc., 276 S.C. 597, 599, 281 S.E.2d 121, \r\n  123 (1981) (holding that \"in the absence of a showing of fraud, mistake, unfair \r\n  dealing or the like, a party to a contract incorporating an arbitration provision \r\n  cannot escape the obligation of such a provision by simply declaring: 'But I \r\n  did not read the whole agreement.' \"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find the Acknowledgment constituted \r\n  a specific communication of an offer which conditioned Towles's continued employment \r\n  on his acceptance of the Employment Arbitration Policy as part of his employment \r\n  contract. See Prescott, \r\n  supra, (noting a unilateral \r\n  contract requires a specific offer communicated to the employee). Towles accepted \r\n  the offer by continuing in his employment. (4) \r\n  See Small, 292 S.C. \r\n  at 484, 357 S.E.2d at 454 (finding an employee accepted employer's offer \"by \r\n  performing the act on which the promise was impliedly or expressly based\"). \r\n  Therefore, we find the evidence leaves room for only one inference: the Acknowledgment \r\n  constituted a binding arbitration agreement. See Small \r\n  292 S.C. at 483, 357 S.E.2d at 454 (noting \"a trial court should submit to the \r\n  jury the issue of existence of a contract when its existence is questioned and \r\n  the evidence is either conflicting or admits of more than one inference\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA recent decision by the Alabama \r\n  Supreme Court analyzing an identical acknowledgment form supports our conclusion. \r\n  See Ex parte \r\n  McNaughton, 728 So.2d 592 (Ala. 1999). In McNaughton, \r\n  United HealthCare Services issued an acknowledgment form containing identical \r\n  language to the Acknowledgment in the present case. Id. \r\n  at 595. The Alabama Supreme Court held the signed acknowledgment form created \r\n  a binding contract to arbitrate employment disputes even though, as here, the \r\n  employee constituted an at-will employee. McNaughton, \r\n  728 So.2d at 594-6. \r\n   \r\nHaving concluded a binding arbitration \r\n  agreement existed, we now address whether the arbitration agreement covered \r\n  Towles's claims. \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnited contends the arbitration agreement's \r\n  coverage extends to Towles's claims. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDetermining whether a party agreed \r\n  to arbitrate a particular dispute is an issue for judicial determination to \r\n  be decided as a matter of contract. (5) Johnson, \r\n  115 F.3d at 377. An arbitration clause is a contractual term, and general rules \r\n  of contract interpretation must be applied to determine a clause's applicability \r\n  to a particular dispute. Zandford v. \r\n  Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., 112 F.3d 723, 727 (4th Cir. 1997). \r\n  When a party invokes an arbitration clause after the contractual relationship \r\n  between the parties has ended, the parties' intent governs whether the clause's \r\n  authority extends beyond the termination of the contract. Zandford, \r\n  112 F.3d at 727.  \r\n   \r\nWe \r\n  must address questions of arbitrability with a healthy regard for the federal \r\n  policy favoring arbitration. Gilmer \r\n  v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 26 (1991), cited in \r\n  Johnson, 148 F.3d at 377. Therefore, \r\n  \" 'any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in \r\n  favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the \r\n  contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense \r\n  to arbitrability.' \" O'Neil, \r\n  115 F.3d at 273-4 (quoting Moses H. \r\n  Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-5 (1983)); \r\n  see also Johnson, 148 \r\n  F.3d at 377. Motions to compel arbitration should not be denied unless the arbitration \r\n  clause is not susceptible of any interpretation that would cover the asserted \r\n  dispute. Zandford, 112 F.3d \r\n  at 727. \r\n   \r\nThe \r\n  arbitration policy provides in pertinent part:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nArbitration \r\n  is the final, exclusive and required forum for the resolution of all employment \r\n  related disputes which are based on a legal claim.\r\n* * \r\n  *\r\nA dispute \r\n  is based on a legal claim and is subject to this Policy if it arises or involves \r\n  a claim under any federal, state or local statute, regulation or common law \r\n  doctrine regarding or relating to employment discrimination, terms and conditions \r\n  of employment, or termination of employment including, but not limited to, the \r\n  following: . . . fair employment practices laws; breach of contract, promissory \r\n  estoppel, or any other contract theory; and defamation, employment negligence, \r\n  or any other tort theory.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTowles \r\n  sued United for defamation, conspiracy, negligent supervision, wrongful discharge, \r\n  unfair or deceptive trade practices, and reckless or intentional infliction \r\n  of emotional distress. The agreement's plain language covers Towles's claims \r\n  relating to employment discrimination, employment negligence, defamation, and \r\n  all other tort or contract theories. Consequently, we hold the arbitration agreement \r\n  covers Towles's claims. See O'Neil, \r\n  115 F.3d at 273-4 (noting that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable \r\n  issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTherefore, \r\n  because Towles and United formed a valid, binding arbitration agreement subject \r\n  to the FAA which encompasses Towles's claims, the FAA requires arbitration. \r\n  The circuit court thus erred in denying United's motion to compel arbitration. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nCURETON \r\nand HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n1.  Towles \r\n  submitted an affidavit asserting he worked as a medical director for PHP rather \r\n  than United. However, United issued Towles's employment confirmation letter \r\n  and Towles's complaint stated he \"was hired as an employee of [United] as the \r\n  management company for PHP in September 1995.\" Nothing in the record indicates \r\n  Towles amended his complaint. Therefore, Towles is bound by his pleadings. See \r\n  Skull Creek Club Ltd. Partnership v. \r\n  Cook and Book, Inc., 313 S.C. 283, 289, 437 S.E.2d 163, 166 (Ct. App. \r\n  1993) (\"It is well settled that parties are judicially bound by their pleadings \r\n  unless withdrawn, altered or stricken by amendment or otherwise.\" (quoting \r\nPostal \r\nv. Mann, 308 S.C. 385, 387, 418 S.E.2d 322, 323 (Ct. App. 1992))). \r\n2.  \r\nFor the \r\npurpose of determining whether the FAA applies, we assume an agreement existed \r\nbetween Towles and United. Whether an agreement actually existed is discussed \r\nin section II of this opinion. \r\n3. \r\n   We note that under South Carolina's Uniform Arbitration Act, the court, \r\n  rather than the jury, determines whether a valid arbitration agreement exists. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a) (Supp. 1998); see also H.L. \r\n  Libby Corp. v. Skelly and Loy, Inc., 910 F. Supp 195, 197-8 (M.D. Pa. \r\n  1995) (noting that under Pennsylvania's Uniform Arbitration Act, a provision \r\n  nearly identical to South Carolina's provision, the court, rather than the jury, \r\n  determines whether an arbitration agreement existed). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder \r\n  the FAA, a party resisting arbitration may request a jury trial to resolve whether \r\n  an arbitration agreement exists, but \"[a] party to an arbitration agreement \r\n  cannot obtain a jury trial merely by demanding one.\" Dillard \r\n  v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 961 F.2d 1148, 1154 \r\n  (5th Cir. 1992); see also 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 4 (1999) (stating \r\n  the party alleged to be in default may demand a jury trial when the making of \r\n  the arbitration agreement is at issue). A jury trial on the existence of an \r\n  arbitration agreement is warranted when there are genuine issues of material \r\n  fact regarding the parties' agreement. Avedon \r\n  Eng'g, Inc. v. Seatex, 126 F.3d 1279, 1283 (10th Cir. 1997). \r\n  The party resisting arbitration bears the burden of showing an entitlement to \r\n  a jury trial under the FAA and must produce some evidence to substantiate the \r\n  allegations that the prevailing law would release him from a contractual obligation \r\n  to arbitrate. Dillard, 961 F.2d \r\n  at 1154. \r\n   \r\n\r\nWe conclude \r\nit was unnecessary to submit to the jury the issue of whether an arbitration agreement \r\nexisted. First, it is not clear whether these procedural rules, which explicitly \r\nreference United States District Courts, apply to state trial courts. Second, \r\neven if the provisions apply to the circuit court, we find the evidence admits \r\nof only one inference: that Towles and United formed a binding arbitration agreement \r\nthus rendering a jury trial on the issue of whether an arbitration agreement existed \r\nimproper.  \r\n4.  Although \r\n  Towles does not raise the issue, we note Towles's continued employment constituted \r\n  sufficient consideration to render the Acknowledgment legally binding. See \r\n  Small, 292 S.C. at 484, 357 \r\n  S.E.2d at 454 (holding an employee's \"action or forbearance in reliance on [employer's] \r\n  promise was sufficient consideration to make the promise legally binding\"); \r\n  Riedman Corp. v. Jarosh, 290 \r\n  S.C. 252, 253, 349 S.E.2d 404, 405 (1986) (holding at-will employment constitutes \r\n  sufficient consideration to support a covenant not to compete); see also \r\n  O'Neil, 115 F.3d at 274-5 (holding \r\n  a mutual promise to arbitrate constituted sufficient consideration to enforce \r\n  an arbitration agreement where the employer proffered, and the employee signed, \r\n  an employee handbook and acknowledgment form \r\nover three \r\nand one-half years after employment began).  \r\n5.  \r\n  The arbitrator, rather than the court, determines whether an issue is arbitrable \r\n  \"only if the contract . . . clearly evinces an intent for the arbitrator to \r\n  make the decision.\" Merrill Lynch, \r\n  Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Havird, Op. No. 2992 (S.C. Ct. App. \r\n  filed May 10, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17, at 42, 44) (citing First \r\n  Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995)). \r\n  The court resolves the arbitrability issues when \r\n  no such intent can be reasonably gleaned from the arbitration agreement. Id. \r\n  In the present case, the arbitration agreement fails to reveal an intent that \r\n  the arbitrator is to determine arbitrability issues. Therefore, the court must \r\n  address whether the arbitration agreement covers Towles's claims.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3078","title":"Laidlaw Environmental Services v.

(Laidlaw) appeals \r\n  the circuit judge's interpretation of a commercial general liability insurance \r\n  policy issued by Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company of Illinois (Aetna). We \r\n  affirm.  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLaidlaw contracted with Radco Process \r\n  Equipment (Radco) to construct a \"baghouse\" (1) \r\n  for Laidlaw's hazardous waste incineration system. Radco abandoned the project \r\n  and Laidlaw hired a replacement contractor to complete construction. When placed \r\n  into operation, the baghouse system leaked.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLaidlaw sued Radco for breach of \r\n  contract, breach of UCC express warranty, breach of UCC implied warranty of \r\n  merchantability, breach of UCC implied warranty of fitness for a particular \r\n  purpose, negligence or recklessness in design and installation of the baghouse, \r\n  and negligent misrepresentation.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 22, 1994, Radco's insurance \r\n  carrier, Aetna, sent Radco a letter stating that it would provide coverage for \r\n  and a defense to Laidlaw's claims under a reservation of rights, pending further \r\n  investigation of the claims. \r\nOn June 1, 1994, Aetna sent Radco \r\n  a letter stating that it would provide coverage for certain, but not all, of \r\n  Laidlaw's claims, once again under a reservation of rights depending on what \r\n  information arose during the discovery process.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe policy Aetna issued to Radco \r\n  contained an endorsement stating \"[t]his insurance does not apply to 'bodily \r\n  injury' or 'property damage' included within the 'products - completed operations \r\n  hazard.' \" The policy defined products - completed operations hazard as follows: \r\n  \r\n11.a. \"Products - completed operations \r\n  hazard\" includes all \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" occurring away from \r\n  premises you own or rent and arising out of \"your product\" or \"your work\" except: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1. Products that are still in your \r\n  physical possession; or \r\n   \r\n2. Work that has not yet been completed \r\n  or abandoned. \r\n   \r\n b. \"Your work\" will be deemed completed \r\n  at the earliest of the following times: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) When all of the work called for \r\n  in your contract has been completed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(2) When all of the work to be done \r\n  at the site has been completed if your contract calls for work at more than \r\n  one site. \r\n   \r\n(3) When that part of the work done \r\n  at a job site has been put into its intended use by any person or organization \r\n  other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the same project. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWork that may need service, maintenance, \r\n  correction, repair or replacement, but which is otherwise complete, will be \r\n  treated as completed.  \r\n   \r\nOn October 19, 1994, Aetna sent Radco \r\n  a letter stating that Laidlaw's claims fell within products - completed operations \r\n  coverage which Radco did not purchase, and therefore Aetna did not feel there \r\n  was any coverage available, nor any obligation to defend under Radco's policy. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nOn September 30, 1995, Radco and \r\n  Laidlaw settled and, as part of the settlement, Radco assigned its rights against \r\n  Aetna to Laidlaw.  \r\n   \r\nOn August 5, 1996, Laidlaw sued Aetna \r\n  for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay, asserting Aetna wrongfully \r\n  denied Radco coverage and withdrew its defense of Radco without reasonable cause. \r\n  Laidlaw subsequently amended its complaint, asserting as a third cause of action \r\n  that Aetna waived its right to deny coverage by first agreeing to provide coverage. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAetna denied the allegations contending \r\n  the policy excluded coverage for the damages Laidlaw sought. Aetna's answer \r\n  attached an affidavit by R. Victor Bell, Radco's principal, which stated Radco \r\n  discussed products - completed operations coverage with Aetna and specifically \r\n  rejected such coverage. Both Aetna and Laidlaw filed cross-motions for summary \r\n  judgment.  \r\n   \r\nThe circuit judge granted Aetna summary \r\n  judgment. Laidlaw appeals, contending the circuit judge erred in (1) finding \r\n  Laidlaw's damages claims fell within the policy's products - completed operations \r\n  hazard exclusion, (2) finding the policy failed to provide coverage for business \r\n  risks and faulty workmanship, (3) dismissing Laidlaw's bad faith claims, (4) \r\n  failing to find exclusion 'm' entitled Laidlaw to summary judgment, and (5) \r\n  failing to find Aetna waived its right to deny Radco coverage. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a \r\n  matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, \r\n  the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Caf&eacute; \r\n  Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Products \r\n  - completed operations exclusion \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is undisputed that this policy \r\n  specifically excludes products - completed operations hazard coverage. Therefore, \r\n  if Laidlaw's claims fall within the policy's products - completed operations \r\n  exclusion, Aetna properly denied coverage under the policy. Accordingly, Laidlaw \r\n  asserts its claims fell within an exception to the policy's products - completed \r\n  operations exclusion and contends the circuit judge erred in finding the policy's \r\n  endorsement excluding such coverage precludes Laidlaw's claims. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"[R]ules of construction require \r\n  clauses of exclusion to be narrowly interpreted, and clauses of inclusion to \r\n  be broadly construed. This rule of construction inures to the benefit of the \r\n  insured.\" McPherson v. Michigan Mut. \r\n  Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 316, 319, 426 S.E.2d 770, 771 (1993). Where the words \r\n  of an insurance policy are capable of two reasonable interpretations, we will \r\n  adopt the construction most favorable to the insured. Forner \r\n  v. Butler, 319 S.C. 275, 277, 460 S.E.2d 425, 427 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing \r\n  Greenville County v. Insurance Reserve \r\n  Fund, 313 S.C. 546, 443 S.E.2d 552 (1994)). \"Furthermore, exclusions \r\n  in an insurance policy are to be construed most strongly against the insurer.\" \r\n  Forner, 319 S.C. at 277, 460 \r\n  S.E.2d at 427. \r\n   \r\nHowever, we subject insurance contracts \r\n  to the same rules of interpretation governing other types of contracts. Unisun \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 331 S.C. 437, 440, 503 S.E.2d 211, 213 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998), cert. granted, (April 22, 1999). \"The foremost rule in interpreting \r\n  an insurance contract is to give effect to the intent of the parties as shown \r\n  by the language of the contract itself. When the contract language is clear \r\n  and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contract's force, and terms \r\n  must be construed to give effect to their 'plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.' \r\n  \" Dorman v. Allstate Ins. Co., \r\n  332 S.C. 176, 178, 504 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1998). \"Ambiguity may not be \r\n  created in an insurance policy by singling out a sentence or a clause . . . \r\n  [and] courts may not torture the ordinary meaning of language to extend coverage \r\n  expressly excluded by the terms of a policy.\" Falkosky \r\n  v. Allstate Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 369, 371, 429 S.E.2d 194, 196 (Ct. App.), \r\n  modified, 312 S.C. 210, 439 S.E.2d 836 (1993) (internal citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBoth parties agree Radco abandoned \r\n  work on Laidlaw's baghouse system. Both parties also agree that another contractor \r\n  finished the work and the baghouse was then put into operation. It is then that \r\n  the baghouse system leaked, causing Laidlaw's damages. Thus, it is clear that \r\n  the work had been both completed, albeit not by Radco, and abandoned before \r\n  the accident occurred. Even though Laidlaw concedes that Radco did not purchase \r\n  products - completed operations coverage, it contends Radco's abandonment invoked \r\n  the second exception to the products - completed operations exclusion, thus \r\n  bringing its claims within the policy's coverage. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy its plain meaning, products - \r\n  completed operations coverage applies when the insured contractor completes \r\n  work on a project. Accordingly, \"[w]ork that has not yet been completed\" is \r\n  still in progress and not covered under the products - completed operations \r\n  coverage. Similarly, work that has not been abandoned is still in progress and \r\n  not covered under products - completed operations coverage. Conversely, when \r\n  an insured abandons work on a project the insured has effectively \"completed\" \r\n  its work for that project, even if the project remains unfinished, thus invoking \r\n  products - completed operations coverage. Consequently, when read in context, \r\n  this policy excludes products - completed operations coverage except when the \r\n  insured's work is still in progress because it has not been completed or not \r\n  been abandoned. Stated differently, this exclusion applies when work has been \r\n  completed or abandoned. Therefore, Radco's abandonment invoked the products \r\n  - completed operation exclusion and precludes Laidlaw's claims. See \r\n  Allan E. Korpela, Annotation, Construction \r\n  and Application of Clause Excluding from Coverage of Liability Policy \"Completed \r\n  Operations Hazards\" 58 A.L.R. 3d 12 (1974) (noting products - completed \r\n  operations coverage generally covers injury or damages after the insured's operations \r\n  as to a particular activity have been completed or abandoned). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMoreover, the policy deems work \"complete\" \r\n  when \"that part of the work done at a job site has been put into its intended \r\n  use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor \r\n  working on the same project.\" It is undisputed that after Radco abandoned the \r\n  project, another contractor finished the baghouse, which Laidlaw then placed \r\n  into operation. This removes all doubt as to the applicability of the products \r\n  - completed operations exclusion, as the work was both abandoned and completed \r\n  within the meaning of the policy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Laidlaw's negligence \r\n  claims \r\n   \r\nLaidlaw next contends that even if \r\n  the products - completed operations exclusion applies, the policy should not \r\n  preclude Laidlaw's underlying claims based on negligence. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nProducts - completed operations coverage \r\n  encompasses bodily injury and property damages arising out of \"your product\" \r\n  or \"your work.\" \"Your work\" means \"[w]ork or operations performed by you or \r\n  on your behalf\" and includes \"[w]arranties or representations made at any time \r\n  with respect to the fitness, quality, durability, performance or use of 'your \r\n  work.' \" Therefore, the policy's language indicates products - completed coverage \r\n  applies to damages arising from the insured's negligence in performing work \r\n  and any negligent misrepresentations made concerning the work. Furthermore, \r\n  the exclusion provides that, \"Work that may need service, maintenance, correction, \r\n  repair or replacement, but which is otherwise complete, will be treated as completed.\" \r\n  This language clearly contemplates problems arising from negligent performance \r\n  of work, providing further indicia that this exclusion applies to negligence \r\n  claims. \r\n   \r\nLaidlaw relies on Devich \r\n  v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 867 F. Supp 1230 (W.D. Pa. 1994), to argue \r\n  its negligence claims are not covered by the products - completed operations \r\n  exclusion. This reliance on Devich \r\n  is misplaced. First, Devich \r\n  did not find general claims of negligence outside the realm of the products \r\n  - completed operations exclusion. The district court's holding, as well as the \r\n  cases it cites as support, is limited to claims of negligent failure to warn. \r\n  Laidlaw made no failure to warn claims against Radco in any of its complaints. \r\n  Second, while we recognize that the reasoning behind the Devich \r\n  decision is that a failure to warn claim involves improper conduct rather than \r\n  a product claim, and that Laidlaw's claims of negligent misrepresentation may \r\n  raise the issue of improper conduct, we are not persuaded we should adopt the \r\n  position of a Pennsylvania federal court applying that state's law to a different \r\n  set of facts. Furthermore, there is authority which we find equally compelling \r\n  from other jurisdictions that is contra to the Devich \r\n  decision. See Flint v. Universal \r\n  Machine Co., 679 A.2d 929, 933, 936-37 (Conn. 1996) (finding products \r\n  - completed operation exclusion unambiguous and applicable to negligent failure \r\n  to warn claims); American States Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., 379 N.E.2d 510, 514 (Ind. App. 1978) \r\n  (finding products - completed operations exclusion applicable to negligent representation \r\n  and failure to warn claims; \"Extension of coverage to all such accidents would \r\n  render a [products - completed operations] exclusion meaningless in the many \r\n  cases in which an insured recommends or makes representations about his products \r\n  or services, or fails to warn of potential dangers.\"); Jones \r\n  v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 259 N.W.2d 70, 74 (Wis. 1977) (finding products \r\n  - completed operations exclusion applicable to negligent representation claims). \r\n  Therefore, we decline to adopt the reasoning of Devich, \r\n  and affirm the circuit judge's ruling on this issue. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Laidlaw's bad faith \r\n  claim \r\n   \r\nBecause we hold Aetna's decision \r\n  to deny coverage comported with the policy, Laidlaw's bad faith claim is moot. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n IV. Exception to policy \r\n  exclusion \"m\" \r\n   \r\nLaidlaw contends the policy provides \r\n  coverage for Laidlaw's claims, including coverage for business risks and faulty \r\n  workmanship, because Laidlaw's claims fit within an exception to exclusion \"m.\" \r\n  The policy excludes coverage for: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nm. \"Property damage\" to \"impaired \r\n  property\" or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  A defect, deficiency, inadequacy \r\n    or dangerous condition in \"your product\" or \"your work\"; or \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  A delay or failure by you or anyone \r\n    acting on your behalf to perform a contract or agreement in accordance with \r\n    its terms.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nThis exclusion does not apply to \r\n  the loss of use of other property arising out of sudden and accidental physical \r\n  injury to \"your product\" or \"your work\" after it has been put to its intended \r\n  use.  \r\n   \r\nThe circuit judge found Laidlaw's \r\n  claims fell within the exception to exclusion \"m.\" Laidlaw now contends the \r\n  policy provides coverage for Laidlaw's claims because Laidlaw's claims fall \r\n  within the exception to exclusion \"m.\" We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLaidlaw's contention the exception \r\n  to exclusion \"m\" creates coverage fails because \"[e]xclusions in an insurance \r\n  policy are to be read independently of each other; they are not to be read cumulatively \r\n  [and] '[i]f any one exclusion applies there should be no coverage, regardless \r\n  of inferences that might be argued on the basis of exceptions or qualifications \r\n  contained in other exclusions.' \" Engineered \r\n  Products, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 295 S.C. 375, 378-79, 368 \r\n  S.E.2d 674, 675-76 (Ct. App. 1988) (quoting Weedo \r\n  v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., 405 A.2d 788, 795 (1979)); see also \r\n  LaMarche v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., \r\n  390 So.2d 325, 326 (Fla.1980) (noting that \"an exclusion does not provide coverage \r\n  but limits coverage\"). It is clear the Aetna policy's products - completed operations \r\n  exclusion bars Laidlaw's claims. Therefore, the exception to exclusion \"m\" cannot \r\n  provide coverage to Laidlaw. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n V. Waiver by Aetna \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Laidlaw contends Aetna waived \r\n  its right to refuse coverage and withdraw representation by originally agreeing \r\n  to provide coverage and representation. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"A waiver is a voluntary and intentional \r\n  abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.\" Janasik \r\n  v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Property Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, \r\n  415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992). The party claiming waiver bears the burden of establishing \r\n  \"that the party against whom waiver is asserted possessed, at the time, actual \r\n  or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all material facts upon which \r\n  those rights depended.\" Heritage Federal \r\n  Sav. and Loan Assoc. v. Eagle Lake and Golf Condominiums, 318 S.C. 535, \r\n  545, 458 S.E.2d 561, 567 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing Janasik, \r\n  307 S.C. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 387-8). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 22, 1994, Aetna sent Radco \r\n  a letter stating: \r\n   \r\nPer our earlier conversation, given \r\n  the nature of the allegations made in the law suit, we find it necessary to \r\n  reserve our rights to disclaim coverage totally or in part at a later date, \r\n  if necessary. Further, any investigation or activity in connection to this claim \r\n  will be handled under a full reservation of rights. Such investigation or activity \r\n  heretofore or hereafter does not prejudice our rights to disclaim coverage at \r\n  a later date, if necessary.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn June 1, 1994, Aetna sent Radco \r\n  a letter stating in part: \"We will provide coverage for the loss under a general \r\n  reservation of rights subject to the definitions and wordings of your policies.\" \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe above correspondence between \r\n  Aetna and Radco reveal Aetna repeatedly reserved its right to deny coverage \r\n  and correspondingly withdraw representation as its investigation of Laidlaw's \r\n  claims proceeded. Laidlaw thus failed to establish Aetna voluntarily and intentionally \r\n  relinquished its right to deny coverage. Moreover, even if Aetna waived its \r\n  right to deny coverage, Laidlaw's contention still fails because \"[w]aiver cannot \r\n  create coverage and cannot bring into existence something not covered in the \r\n  policy.\" Alverson v. Minnesota Mut. \r\n  Life Ins. Co., 287 S.C. 432, 434, 339 S.E.2d 140, 142 (Ct. App. 1985). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the summary \r\n  judgment order is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n   \r\nCURETON and HOWARD, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1.  According \r\n  to Laidlaw, a \"baghouse\" is essentially a dust filtration and collection system \r\n  which is used to remove fly ash and other particulate matter from the gas stream \r\n  resulting from the incineration of hazardous material. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3079","title":"State v.

Pope, of York, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Charlie \r\n  Lee White appeals his conviction and sentence for driving under the influence, \r\n  second offense. After the State rested, the solicitor informed the trial court \r\n  that the State and defense had stipulated jurisdiction was proper in the trial \r\n  court as this was White's second offense. South Carolina Code Annotated section \r\n  56-5-2980 (Supp. 1998) states, \"the indictment shall not contain allegations \r\n  of prior offenses\" if the accused stipulates with the solicitor \"that the charge \r\n  constitutes a second or further offense.\" The trial court allowed the jury to \r\n  have the indictment and the exhibits with it during deliberations, but not before \r\n  instructing trial counsel \"[to] check the indictment and make sure the exhibits \r\n  are in order to be taken back to the jury.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, White complains about \r\n  the trial court's failure to redact from the indictment the phrase, \"such not \r\n  being the first offense within a period of ten years including and immediately \r\n  preceding the foregoing date,\" before giving the indictment to the jury. We \r\n  affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1. The issue is not preserved for \r\n  appellate review because White failed to raise it to the trial court in any \r\n  way.(2) Indeed, his own conduct in failing to \r\n  object to the unredacted indictment when given an express opportunity to review \r\n  it prompted the very error about which he now complains. This he cannot do.(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\n2. Nor is the issue, as White contends, \r\n  one that affects the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction and thus permits \r\n  him to raise it at this level notwithstanding his failure to present it first \r\n  to the trial court. Although the statute forbids including language within an \r\n  indictment of an accused's conviction of a prior offense when the accused and \r\n  the solicitor stipulate \"that the charge constitutes a second or further offense,\"(4) \r\n  nothing within the statute divests the court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to determine the issues involved in the case if the language is not removed \r\n  from the indictment. We, of course, must take the statute as we find it, giving \r\n  effect to the legislative intent as expressed in its language. We cannot under \r\n  our power of construction supply an omission in the statute.(5) \r\n  At most, the stipulation rendered the language in question surplusage. \"Unnecessary \r\n  language does not vitiate an indictment . . . .\"(6) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and HEARN, \r\n  J., concur. \r\n1.
